      <p>A fundraising page was set up for a 24-year-old man killed in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/man-24-dies-crash-leaves-17289455">an horrific car smash</a> in the early hours of yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>Tributes have been paid to the man, named in the Gofundme page as Stevo or "Con Ste", believed to be short for Connor Stephens.</p>
      <p>He was the driver of a white Audi A1 which flipped on to its roof in a  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/man-24-dies-crash-leaves-17289455">crash on Moss Lane</a> ,  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/burscough">Burscough</a> , shortly after 4am on Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>An 18-year-old, understood to have been a passenger in the car, was taken to hospital and is today still described as in a critical condition.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lancashire.police.uk/contact-us/request-information/media-enquiries/">Lancashire Police</a>  confirmed that the  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/car-flips-onto-roof-horrific-17285528">car had earlier been stolen from Eccleston, near Chorley</a>  .</p>

      <p>"Our Con Ste was the main man of our family and no one could ever say they were not touched by his infectious smile and his cheeky attitude.</p>
