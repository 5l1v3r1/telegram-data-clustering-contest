        <b>Declan Rudd says any extra attention Preston North End start to receive with being at the top end of the Championship can only be regarded as positive.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lilywhites resume action at Derby County on Saturday in second place in the table, having enjoyed a strong first 16 games of the campaign.</p>

      <p>Their trip to Pride Park is one of 10 league games they will play between now and January 1.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, the plaudits have started to come their way in the shape of attention from the national media.</p>
      <p>After largely being ignored previously – or flying under the radar – it makes a nice change for goalkeeper Rudd.</p>
      <p>“We have been in and around it in other seasons but no one really spoke about us,” Rudd said.</p>

      <p>“You could drive into work listening to the radio and it would all be about other teams.</p>
      <p>“Now there is a bit more attention on us and it brings a bit more pressure, which can help us.</p>
      <p>“I think pressure can get you on your game, make sure you reach the standards you have set.</p>
      <p>“There are more people keeping an eye on us now, we’ve got a few more games on the television than we usually have.</p>

      <p>“It makes it a bigger occasion which hopefully brings out the best in our players.</p>
      <p>“The bigger the occasion means that if you do win it feels great.</p>
      <p>“There is a hunger here to do well – we go out to try and win every game.”</p>
      <p>North End will spend plenty of time on their travels in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>The Derby game is followed by Wednesday night’s visit to Hull City.</p>
      <p>Following their taste of Monday night football against West Bromwich Albion at Deepdale on December 2, Alex Neil’s men head to London to take on QPR.</p>
      <p>Then there are trips to Cardiff and Leeds before December is out.</p>
      <p>Preston have been far stronger at home than they have away – certainly in terms of results.</p>
      <p>The Championship record at Deepdale is: won seven, drawn two, lost none.</p>
      <p>Away from home, it is won two, drawn two and lost three.</p>
      <p>Two of the defeats came in the opening fortnight of the season, so things have improved on the road.</p>
      <p>Giving that away form a little boost will be the challenge in the weeks ahead.</p>
      <p>Rudd said: “We can change our approach if we need to, we have got the players to do that.</p>
      <p>“If we need to go away and have a battle, we’ve got lads to come in.</p>
      <p>“And if we need to change it to keep the ball more, we can do that.</p>
      <p>“The manager is in his third year here and he has got a squad together which pretty much contains players who have come in under him.</p>
      <p>“That does make a big difference, everyone knows what he wants from them.</p>
      <p>“At Charlton when we won earlier in the month we might only have scored once but we were quite comfortable.</p>
      <p>“We played a lot in their half which is something we always try to do, there haven’t been many occasions when we have been stuck in our box and unable to get out.</p>
      <p>“The higher up the pitch you defend, the closer to their box you are to create chances when you nick the ball back.</p>
      <p>“That is something we have been working on with the gaffer since he came here and you are seeing the results a lot more.</p>
      <p>“We have got a lot of away games coming up and they will all be tough.</p>
      <p>“It is a crucial period for us to show what we are made of as a team, that we can go away and do what we have been doing at home. We are confident that we can crack on.”</p>
      <p>Rudd makes it clear that there is no feeling in the Preston dressing room that anything has been achieved yet.</p>
      <p>Their current position is a healthy one but it is very much a feet-on-the-ground job with 16 games played and another 30</p>
      <p>to go.</p>
      <p>“We’ve made a positive start, improved on what we did to start with last season and given ourselves a building block to push on from,” said Rudd.</p>
      <p>“We still have 30 games to go and if we don’t do it for the rest of the season, what we’ve done so far would be pointless.</p>
      <p>“We enjoy being in the position we are but we aren’t getting carried away. You have to put league positions to the back of your mind and concentrate on the present.</p>
      <p>“As a team and a squad we have been more robust this season, we know when we might have to play ugly.</p>
      <p>“I think we are better at turning negatives into positives. There are going to be negatives along the way but it is about how you deal with them.</p>
      <p>“You can’t dwell on the negatives – learn from them, yes, but don’t dwell and worry about them.</p>
      <p>“We are going well at the moment and the aim is to drive on and keep the form going.”</p>
