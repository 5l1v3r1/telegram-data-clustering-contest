      <p>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! is back for 2019 with an all new line-up of stars looking to face their fears in the jungle over the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Of course, most of us can assume that they haven't volunteered to survive on a diet of rice and beans and eat kangaroo balls for free.</p>
      <p>And enrolling celebrities to participate in Bushtucker trials doesn't come cheap.</p>
      <p>The highest paid contestant this year is raking in a whopping £500,000, and a TV insider has revealed to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/how-much-im-celebrity-stars-20890344?_ga=2.89867992.294771759.1574349828-533399201.1543484565">The Mirror</a> that ITV bosses have splashed out as much a 1.4 million on fees this year.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at what it is thought that the jungle entrants are being paid, and some are earning up to ten times less than their co-stars.</p>
      <p>70-year-old Caitlyn Jenner is unsurprisingly the highest paid 2019 camp mate, with a reported £500,000 fee.</p>

      <p>If it's true then it would make her one of the highest earners in the show ever, with Noel Edmonds rumoured to have been paid between £500,000 and £600,000 for his appearance last year.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec referred to the rumours in the opening show.</p>
      <p>Introducing the show, Dec said: "We've got reality TV royalty Caitlyn Jenner. Most people come into the jungle to lose a few pounds," with Ant adding: "But she's going to be gaining 500,000 of them according to the papers."</p>
      <p>Dec then responded, telling Ant, "Don't believe everything you read in the papers, Ant. You know that," suggesting that Caitlyn might not be earning quite so much.</p>
      <p>Ex-Arsenal player and football legend Ian Wright is the next best paid star, who has been flown Down Under for a reported fee of £400,000 followed by ex-Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle, who will apparently be paid £250,000.</p>
      <p>Andy Whyment, who is known for playing factory worker Kirk on Coronation Street, is reportedly the only other campmate to be taking a six-figure pay cheque home too after negotiating a fee of £100,000.</p>
      <p>Ex-Eastenders actor Jacqueline Jossa is said to be receiving £75,000 for her jungle stint, alongside Good Morning Britain host Kate Garraway, reports <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/how-much-money-im-celeb-17294430?fbclid=IwAR3W86SiXDcwmQXobVg69IW1hJp_M-zqiMSiLMSpayn6KhhsIsqEQB2hePc">Leeds Live</a> .</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, rugby player James Haskell and Radio One DJ Adele Roberts trail slightly behind with their rumoured £50,000 fees.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the two celebs with the lowest pay cheques are two of the youngest in the group.</p>
      <p>Spandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp son, Roman Kemp - Capital FM DJ - is thought to be earning £40,000 for his jungle adventure.</p>
      <p>Last up is X Factor star Myles Stephenson who won the singing competition back in 2017 while being in British boy band Rak-Su.</p>
      <p>He is expected to take home £25,000 for his jungle debut.</p>

      <p>It's not known what Irish comedian Andrew Maxwell will be paid.</p>
      <p>And apparently, even if they decide that the jungle life isn't for them, they still get paid their full paycheck - well, if history is anything to go by.</p>
      <p>When The Only Way Is Essex's Gemma Collins dropped out of the jungle in 2014's series after just three days, she reportedly got paid her full fee anyway.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity representatives have declined to comment.</p>
