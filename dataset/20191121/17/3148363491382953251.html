      <p>“The less people that see me dance the better,” Buttigieg told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/21/mayor-pete-buttigiug-decline-dance-democratic-debate/">a TMZ cameraman</a> on Thursday morning. “I just don’t have that coordination.”</p>
      <p>Supporters across the country are sharing videos of the special dance featuring Buttigieg’s campaign walk-on song High Hopes by Panic! at the Disco.</p>
      <p>But Buttigieg said he was aware of the viral dance fever sweeping the nation.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, you know I think joy is a really important part of this campaign and letting it all out, that’s a big part of that,” he said.</p>
      <p>The dance was popularized on social media after video surfaced of one volunteer teaching the proper moves to supporters young and old.</p>
