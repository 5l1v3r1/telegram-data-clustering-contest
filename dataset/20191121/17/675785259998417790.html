      <h1>Paul Routledge: 'If two million new voters follow Unite oldies' wisdom Labour will win'</h1>
      <h2>If they show half the gumption and wisdom of Unite’s oldies, the poll outcome is not in doubt.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:52:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Routledge, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/paul-routledge/</a></address>
      <p>The election is pretty much over, and Labour has won a resounding victory.</p>
      <p>Well, it is if the retired members of Unite the union have anything to do with it.</p>
      <p>Speaking at their ­conference in Brighton a couple of days ago, I conducted a straw poll on who was going to vote for which party come December 12.</p>
      <p>Among almost a hundred there, none will vote nationalist – either SNP or Plaid Cymru – and none will do as they’re told by bossyboots Jo Swinson of the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>As for the Tories, all I got was a low growl. All the hands went up for Labour, except for one brave Brexit Party voter.</p>
      <p>Of course, this proves nothing. It’s an unscientific, statistically unrepresentative expression of opinion by a roomful of elderly troublemakers. Like me.</p>
      <p>But I like to think – indeed, I do think – that it’s a distillation of political wisdom from a generation that has seen everything from Hitler and Hiroshima to the rocky-horror show of contemporary capitalism.</p>
      <p>They have seen right through Alexander de Pfeffel ­Johnson’s fake “blue Conservatism” that pretends to care about working-class people and their families.</p>
      <p>And they’re still fighting the good fight under Unite’s banner “Retired From Work – But Not From The Fight”. An army of 60,000 volunteers in branches all around the country.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s free TV licences for the over 75s, the social-care crisis, winter fuel allowance or the unfair treatment of the 1950s’ generation of women pensioners, they won’t – in Dylan Thomas’ immortal phrase – go gentle into that good night.</p>
      <p>More than two million new voters have registered for the first time for this election, and most of them will be young people.</p>
      <p>If they show half the gumption and wisdom of Unite’s oldies, the poll outcome is not in doubt. </p>
