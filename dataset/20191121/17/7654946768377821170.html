      <h1>Woman who killed twin sister sobs in court, begs family for forgiveness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:53:58+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Brown</a></address>
      <p>The New Jersey woman who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/dying-new-jersey-woman-identified-twin-sister-as-her-killer/">stabbed her twin sister to death</a> during a drunken brawl broke down in court Thursday as she was sentenced to six years in prison.</p>
      <p>“I know there’s nothing I can say to justify what I did,” Amanda Ramirez bawled before being sentenced for the June slaying of her twin, mother of three Anna Ramirez, <a href="https://www.nj.com/camden/2019/11/woman-sobs-through-apology-for-killing-twin-sister-in-drunken-fight-judge-sentences-her-to-6-years.html">according to NJ.com</a>.</p>
      <p>“I just want to make it clear that I never had intentions of taking my twin sister’s life. If I could take back what I did I would in a heartbeat.</p>
      <p>“There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about my twin. And having to live with the fact that she’s no longer alive is devastating,” she told Camden County Superior Court with tears running down her face, the site said.</p>
      <p>“I just want to apologize to my family for putting them through this. I hope that they all can forgive me.”</p>
      <p>Ramirez <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/05/nj-woman-admits-to-fatally-stabbing-identical-twin-in-drunken-rage/">pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter</a> in September, saying she killed her sister in Camden on June 22 after a heavy night of drinking. She does not remember what they fought about, she insists.</p>
      <p>Her attorney, Jordan Zeitz, blamed his client’s postpartum depression — and begged for a light sentence because the family wanted to “get her back to them so they can heal quicker,” according to the report.</p>
      <p>“The sentence you are going to impose is going to pale in comparison to the life sentence she’s already serving,” Zeitz told Judge Edward McBride, NJ.com said.</p>
      <p>Two of Ramirez’s sisters also asked the court for leniency, with Bianca Medina, 16, saying the twins’ bond was “unbreakable.”</p>
      <p>“This hurts me deeply, but I need her to help me cope,” Medina said of her killer sister, the mother of a two-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>“You hold my sister’s life in your hands, so please be gentle.”</p>
      <p>Judge McBride told the court he believed the killing was an “aberration” for Ramirez — but also noted she had initially lied to police, saying she found her sister stabbed. She later said her sister died as they struggled over a knife the dead woman brought out, the report said.</p>
      <p>Ramirez was sentenced to six years in prison and will have to serve five years and one month before being eligible for parole, NJ.com said.</p>
