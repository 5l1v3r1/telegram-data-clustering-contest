      <p>Colin Kaepernick might not be in the National Football League anymore, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t still a marketable athlete.</p>
      <p>The quarterback is reportedly close to some big news with Nike after Yahoo Sports reported that the footwear and apparel company is set to unveil his very own signature shoe in December.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old signed an endorsement deal with Nike in September 2018 and a shoe was part of the deal.</p>
      <p>The shoe will reportedly be released next month in a nationwide release.</p>

      <blockquote>“The inclusion of a shoe and a Kaepernick branded “Icon” jersey was first reported by Yahoo Sports in 2018, with his footwear rollout speculated to be on track for the 2019 holiday season. Sources told Yahoo this week that Nike is expecting a nationwide release of the shoe early next month as it continues to develop the company’s endorsement strategy around Kaepernick.<br/><br/>Although the total number of Icon jerseys sold by Nike is unknown, the February online release of that item sold out in a matter of hours. Priced at $150 upon release, the authentic versions of the Nike jersey now sell on the secondary market for $300 or more. Counterfeit versions of the jersey have also spread across secondary clothing sites for $50 or more.”</blockquote>
      <p>Carolina Panthers safety Eric Reid gave a sneak peak of those shoes on Instagram.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick, then a San Francisco 49er, rose to national prominence in 2016 when he began a kneeling movement during the singing of the “Star-Spangled Banner” to protest police brutality.</p>
