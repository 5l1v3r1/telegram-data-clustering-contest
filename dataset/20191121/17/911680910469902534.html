      <p>Taylor Swift will be receiving her 2019 <i>American Music Awards' Artist of the Decade </i>award this year, in addition to performing some of her songs.</p>
      <p>This comes <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/national/taylor-swift-will-be-able-to-perform-her-hits-at-the-amas-after-all">after drama with her former record label, Big Machine Records, and Scooter Braun, who she claimed would not allow her to play her earlier works</a> because they own the rights to her music, which they later denied.</p>
      <p>Both BMR and Braun agreed to let her perform her music to celebrate her big award, except Taylor has decided to go a different angle, making this performance one to keep an eye out for.</p>
