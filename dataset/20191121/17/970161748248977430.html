      <p>Stephen Fry has expressed his excitement after being cast for a guest role in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/doctor-who-series-12-adds-lenny-henry-and-stephen-fry-as-guest-stars-and-it-almost-makes-up-for-no-christmas-special-11189758/"> – alongside Lenny Henry.</a></p>
      <p>Jodie Whittaker’s Time Lord will be travelling the universe once again and in series 12 she will meet the pair along the way.</p>
      <p>And while both of their characters are being kept a secret for now – we are yet to discover whether they’ll be a friend or foe</p>
      <p>Stephen has exclaimed how happy he is to be cast the role describing it as a ‘very sweet second-place excitement’.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘Short of being picked for a British space exploration programme and I readily concede that I’m past the age where I’d be considered (if I was ever the right age for such a posting) – then being in an episode of Doctor Who will certainly do as a very sweet second-place excitement.’</p>

      <p>Sir Lenny, equally excited, added: ‘It was absolutely brilliant to be welcomed into the fantastical world of Doctor Who. The nearest I have been to the TARDIS was when I played the Caribbean Doctor in the Lenny Henry Show , so as a life-long (hiding behind the sofa type) Doctor Who fan this is a very special moment for me.’</p>

      <p>Showrunner Chris Chibnall said he is buzzing to be working with ‘two of my absolute favourite actors’.</p>
      <p>‘Doctor Who is coming back with a bang – with two great British icons in major roles,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘One of the great joys of Doctor Who is getting to work with actors from your wish list. Stephen and Lenny are two of my absolute favourite actors – and to be able to bring them into Doctor Who, in our one of our biggest ever stories to kick off the new series, is an absolute thrill.’</p>
      <p>Series 12, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/doctor-confirm-series-12-filming-wrapped-epic-video-jodie-whittaker-11183204/">which has just finished filming</a>, will reunite Chris with Lenny, who appeared in series three of his crime drama Broadchurch.</p>
      <p>The news comes after reports that Doctor Who is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/is-doctor-who-going-to-surprise-fans-by-starting-new-series-on-new-years-day-11187055/">set to kick off with a New Year’s Day special</a> in place of a Christmas episode for the second year running.</p>
