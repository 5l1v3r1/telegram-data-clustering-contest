      <h1>Publisher offering to give Alaska newspaper away to new editor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:22:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Hooper</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- The publisher of an Alaska newspaper said he is willing to give the entire operation away to a person or couple willing to relocate to the town and oversee the operation.</p>
      <p>Larry Persily, owner<a href="https://skagwaynews.com/2019/11/20/local-ownership-best-for-the-newspaper-and-the-community/"> of The Skagway News,</a> said the he has been editing the paper remotely ever since his editor resigned, and he is now seeking a new editor to live in Skagway and take ownership of the paper.</p>
      <p>"The only way this paper has a long-term future, and anything that I've ever seen that works with small town weeklies or bi-weeklies is where the small town editor owns, lives and are in the community," Persily wrote. "And that's what this needs."</p>
      <p>Persily said he would be willing to turn the paper over without charge to a person or couple who either live in Skagway or would be willing to relocate.</p>
      <p>The publisher purchased the newspaper in April for an undisclosed amount, but he said it was less than six figures.</p>
      <p>Interested potential owner/editors are being asked to email Persily at paper@alaskan.com.</p>
