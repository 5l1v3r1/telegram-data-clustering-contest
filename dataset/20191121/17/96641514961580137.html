      <p>GM plans to bring an electric truck to the market in fall of 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/gm-will-bring-an-electric-truck-to-market-in-2021/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a> reports. GM CEO Mary Barra made the announcement today during GM's <a href="https://investor.gm.com/events/event-details/general-motors-host-investor-event-0">investor day</a>.</p>
      <p>GM's electric truck plans were rumored last month, when the <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2019/10/17/uaw-gm-detroit-hamtramck-electric-pickup/3998740002/"><i>Detroit Free Press</i></a> reported that the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant would remain open to produce the electric pickup. But this is the first time the company has mentioned a timeline.</p>
      <p>The electric truck market is becoming more crowded. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/09/rivian-electric-vehicles-can-charge-each-other/">Rivian's R1T</a> electric pickup is slated to arrive in 2020, and Tesla plans to introduce its electric truck in 2021. Ford is developing an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/17/ford-fully-electric-f-series-pickup-truck/">all-electric F-150</a>, and while the automaker has shared a video of its prototype <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/23/electric-ford-f-150-tow-over-a-million-pounds/">towing over one million pounds</a>, it has not specified when the EV will arrive.</p>
