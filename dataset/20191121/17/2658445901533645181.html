      <p>Over 800 residents of the eight communities in Tarkwa Bay Island, a Lagos riverine, have received free medical services from the 81 Division, Nigerian Army (NA).</p>
      <p>The medical raphsody which was being conducted simultaneously in Lagos and Ogun States as part of Exercise Crocodile Smile IV, was aimed at fostering civil-military relations and by extension gaining the people’s trust in security agencies.</p>
      <p>The Nation reports that the army also donated exercise books to primary and secondary school pupils of the island assuring them they were in the area for their safety, security.</p>
      <p>The locals who trooped out for the medical raphsody said they were appreciative of the gesture especially because there was no functional hospital there.</p>
      <p>They appealed to the government to equip their Primary Health Centres, provide electricity in the community and give renovate fence their schools.</p>
      <p>A septuagenarian Mary</p>
      <p>Anthony who has suffereer arthritis for several years told reporters she was overjoyed because they the medical team gave her drugs and told her the things she should be eating in order to better her condition.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Anthony’s 55-year-old daughter Elizabeth who said she was suffering from hypertension, thanked the army for running several checks on her and giving her medications.</p>
      <p>“I have been suffering from high blood pressure for sometime now. I was diagnosed of it at a private clinic and since then, I have been using some sachet medicines for N150 pr N200 to control it but today, they have given me plenty drugs and told me how to use them.</p>
      <p>“But the soldiers did many tests on me today and then, they gave me drugs. They told me how to use the drugs too. They also gave me malaria drugs and I am grateful to them for all they have done.</p>
      <p>“So many people have been receiving treatments since on Monday. It is all free. They treat every complian and those they cannot handle here, they take the people to their hospital in Lagos. It is a good thing they are doing and I am happy,” she said.</p>
      <p>The traditional ruler, Oloja Fatai Olusesi, said the army had been consistent in bringing free services to the community, appealing to the government to provide electricity and water to make life easier for them.</p>
      <p>Olusesi, who said there were about 5,000 people in the osland, explained that those who have generators usually went to Lagos city through the water to get petrol.</p>
      <p>Headmaster Epiphany Anglican Primary School Odebode Olabisi said they were in need of teachers, appealing that the school be fenced.</p>
      <p>“We need fence around our school for security purpose. Some of our children pass through the water to school and so, we want the government to help us with boat. Government should also help us provide a staff quarters here.</p>
      <p>“Presently, we have about 366 pupils and three government assigned teachers plus myself, the headmaster. As a result of the inadequacy of the number of teachers, we met the parents’ forum to help us and they contacted some youths in the community who have NCE and five agreed to teach the children for a token of N10,000,” he said.</p>
      <p>Director of Education Oluwalola Adeniniyi, who has been in the on the island for six years, also pleaded with the state government to fence the schools there to protect pupils from danger.</p>
      <p>Adeniniyi, who doubles as Principal, Government Senior Secondary School, said a student of the school was attacked on Monday by hoodlums who took advantage of the porosity of the place.</p>
      <p>“The facility here is not adequate because our student population is growing. At the moment, we have one block for junior school and one for senior school. The structural inadequacies also discourage teachers from coming down here to teach.</p>

      <p>“We want the government to get us staff quarters that will accommodate the teachers posted here. We also want the fence and gate erected here for security purpose. Just recently some hoodlums came into the school to attack some of our students here and that will not be the first time,” he said.</p>
      <p>In an interview with reporters, Commander 81 Division Medical Services Col. Oludare Oni said the people’s response was encouraging, adding that prevalent issues were malaria, skin diseases, eye problem for older people and malnutrition in children.</p>
      <p>“You can see we have a side lab where tests are conducted before treatments commenced. We started with pregnant women and nursing mothers, children and the elderly. Treated mosquito nets were issued.</p>
      <p>“Some people had dental issues which were taken care of. Some had their tooth removed, others were washed. Those with eye problems were checked and issued medicated glasses. For those who need surgical or any other treatment, they were given referrals to our hospital at Obalende where they will be treated for free.</p>
      <p>“When we got here, we noticed that the children were malnourished and so, one of the lectures was on nutrition especially for children. The exercise is ongoing. The treatment will continue and when we wrap up this exercise, we will go to the health centres to know what they need and how we can help,” he said.</p>
