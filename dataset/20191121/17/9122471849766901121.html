      <h1>Urban Meyer Sends Video Message To Ohio State Fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:32:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Ohio State Buckeyes take on the Penn State Nittany Lions this weekend in what is essentially a Big Ten Championship Game play-in. Ahead of the game, former Buckeyes head coach Urban Meyer had a message for the fans.</p>
      <p>In a message directed at Block O – the student section – he called on the students to show up nice and early to the stadium for FOX Sports’ Big Noon Kickoff Show.</p>
      <p>“See you Saturday 10 AM sharp at the RPAC. (Big Noon Kickoff) needs your support,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>Considering that ESPN is going to be hosting <i>College GameDay</i> at the same time, FOX is really bringing out the big guns to make sure they have the bigger crowd.</p>
      <p>But there’s no doubting Meyer’s sincerity in wanting to see his former team succeed – especially in this game.</p>
      <p>In his seven years at the helm, Meyer went 6-1 against Penn State. But that lone loss in 2016 ultimately cost them a trip to the Big Ten Championship Game.</p>
      <p>But Ohio State boasts one of its most complete teams ever, dominating on both sides of the football. They are currently the No. 1 offense in college football (51.5 points per game scored) AND the No. 1 defense in the nation (9.8 points per game allowed).</p>
      <p>They’ll be put to the test on both of those fronts against a Penn State team that ranks 15th in scoring and 7th on defense.</p>
      <p>Get ready for a fun one.</p>
