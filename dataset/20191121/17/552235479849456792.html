      <h1>Andy Murray reveals his marriage suffered under the strain of his long injury lay off</h1>
      <h2>The Scots tennis star says that his wife Kim bore the brunt of his frustration as his hip injury threatened his career and left him in constant agony.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:25:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author">James Moncur</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/tennis/andy-murray-admits-overweight-after-20922887">Andy Murray</a> has admitted his marriage was put under a “lot of strain” following the hip injury that threatened to end his tennis career.</p>
      <p>In a brutally honest interview, the 32-year-old said he put on a brave face for his children but that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/andy-murray-expecting-third-child-20563220">wife Kim</a> bore the brunt of his frustration during a long lay off.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the double Wimbledon champion says the episode taught him a lot about life he wouldn’t ordinarily have been exposed to.</p>
      <p>And he’s now back firing on all cylinders for the GB team at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/tennis/andy-murray-absence-cant-stop-20930704">Davis Cup</a> in Madrid this week.</p>
      <p>An Amazon documentary on his recovery battle will be released later this month and will give an insight into how the injury affected his family life.</p>

      <p>In the film, called ‘Resurfacing’, Sir Andy says: “I was pretty down, that’s for sure. It was a really tough period for me because it wasn’t so much the actual injury itself.</p>
      <p>“Being injured can be frustrating, but the issue that I had was with me every single day, sleeping and walking. It wasn’t just I hit a serve and my arm hurt. This woke me up in the night. It was bad.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if the children noticed because when I’m with them I’m always trying to put on a brave face, but my wife definitely did. It put a lot of strain on our relationship, just because I was down all the time.”</p>
      <p>And praising artist Kim, whom he married in his hometown of Dunblane in 2015, the triple Grand Slam winner added: “She has been brilliant and I would probably be quite selfish, just in terms of thinking about myself and how I’m feeling all the time and not actually realising the impact that has on all the people around me.”</p>

      <p>Andy is now back playing again after undergoing a hip resurfacing operation earlier this year and the couple’s third child, a boy called Teddy, was born last month.</p>
      <p>The couple also have two daughters, Sophia, three, and two-year-old Edie.</p>
      <p>He revealed that despite the encouraging words he had from family and friends, it had been hard to keep going.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was, like, ‘You don’t know what it’s like. You don’t know what it is that I’m feeling.</p>
      <p>“I probably didn’t take into consideration what that was doing to everyone around me. I see a little of this in the documentary. Some bits of it are quite hard for me to watch.”</p>
      <p>He explained the surgery had changed his outlook on life, adding: “People say it all the time, but for me this was genuinely life-changing for all sorts of reasons, not just to play tennis, but when I’m crawling through a tunnel in soft play with my children, or just getting down on the floor to play and roll around with them. I couldn’t do that before.”</p>

      <p>He also revealed that despite always having a family focus, the injury highlighted that he’s lost without tennis.</p>
      <p>He explained: “For most of my life family has been important, but tennis, what do I do without tennis?</p>
      <p>“Now I realise that life is great without tennis as well, providing you have your health and you know, obviously I’ve got a brilliant family at home.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a real journey for me. I’ve just learnt a bit about my life that without the injury I probably wouldn’t have had.”</p>
