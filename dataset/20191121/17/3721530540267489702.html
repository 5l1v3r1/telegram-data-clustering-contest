      <p>A team of modders has created a rudimentary <a href="https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption/2019/9/18/20872157/red-dead-online-undead-nightmare-rumor-zombies-glitch-ps4-xbox-one">zombie mode up and running for <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> on PC</a>, and it looks tremendous.</p>
      <p>One of the first glimpses of the mode showed up on YouTube just yesterday <a href="https://youtu.be/4eTGyWJhtQo">on the channel of one jedijosh920</a>. Collaborating through a Discord channel, folks have cobbled together a handful of zombie skins and an AI that spawns in and rushes players from all angles. They’re not yet biting and slashing with claws; instead they go after players with hunting knives. But it gets the job done.</p>
      <p>There’s no objective other than to survive, but what’s fascinating is how adaptive and elastic the non-player characters are. The video starts out in a saloon, and patrons freak out and fight back in a realistic fashion. The action spills out onto the street, where the player and another AI end up back-to-back in the muddy ruts on the road. The action switches to a more populated town, where the undead start streaming in from the rooftops. With the lighting and the melee animations, it’s all very evocative of a good zombie flick.</p>
      <p>Some fans claim to have seen teases of an official Undead Nightmare mode in the game on consoles, but there’s been no official announcement of such a thing. Rockstar missed the Halloween holiday for a proper, and seems to be mostly concerned with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/7/20952369/red-dead-redemption-2-rdr2-pc-gameplay-freeze-crash">squashing bugs on PC than adding new modes to the game</a>. Time will tell if that holds true through the holiday season. In the meantime, we’ll be hunting down tutorials on how to get this new zombie mod up and running.</p>
