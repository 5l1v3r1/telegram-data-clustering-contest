      <h1>International ‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’ Poster Confirms Porgs are in the Movie, And Isn’t That What Matters Most?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:30:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p>The new <b><i>Star Wars</i> </b>movies are notorious for their secrecy. Disney and Lucasfilm play things very close to the vest, striving hard to maintain an element of surprise. As a result, we’re often left in the dark regarding what to expect. For instance: there have been <i>zero</i> Porgs shown in the marketing for this film, and I was starting to get worried. Well, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief, because a new international <b><i>Rise of Skywalker</i> </b>poster confirms that there is indeed at least one adorable, squawking Porg in the film. Protect it at all costs. Check out the <i>Rise of Skywalker</i> international poster below.</p>

      <p>First of all, this poster is pretty cool on its own. It has that retro <i>Star Wars</i> vibe, and while I long for the days of Drew Struzan, I’ll happily take any sort of poster that isn’t just a series of Photoshopped faces. The usual suspects are here: Rey, Kylo Ren, Finn, Poe. Hux gets to give us a sideways glance, and even <b>Richard E. Grant</b>‘s character makes an appearance, along with the Knights of Ren. But the thing I care about is on the lower lefthand side of the poster. Computer, enhance:</p>

      <p>Standing there, on its own, in front of <b>Dominic Monaghan</b>‘s new character, Rose Tico, C-3PO, R2-D2, BB-8 and the new droid D-O, is a Porg. I can only assume that this is the Porg who we saw in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon in <i>The Last Jedi</i>, and I am thrilled the creature made it into this new film in some capacity. All I ask is that <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> keeps this precious creature safe. Go ahead, blow up C-3PO, I really don’t care. Just let the Porg live. Please. I beg you.</p>
