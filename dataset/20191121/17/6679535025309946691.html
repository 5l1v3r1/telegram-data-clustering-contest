      <h1>Michelangelo Amendola on a roll at MRF Challenge</h1>
      <h2>Dominates free practice in Dubai</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:07:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sports-Bureau-212/" target="_blank">Sports Bureau</a></address>
      <p>Belgium’s 17-year old Michelangelo Amendola set the early pace dominating both free practice sessions as the eighth season of the International MRF Challenge commenced at the Dubai Autodrome on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Amendola, who finished fifth overall in the 2018-19 championship, topped the time sheet in the first session clocking one minute, 58.551 seconds and followed it up with a 01:58.806 in the next.</p>
      <p>Finishing second behind Amendola in the red-flag interrupted FP1 were two other 17-year-olds, Great Britain’s Joshua Mason (01:59.882) and Yuven Sundaramoorthy from the United States (01:59.912).</p>
      <p>The lone Indian in the fray, Chetan Korada struggled in both sessions, finishing last in the nine-car field.</p>
      <p>Amendola was pleased as punch with his performance.</p>
      <p>“It went pretty well considering that I was driving after a long time. The last time I drove was in Chennai in February (2018-19), so I had no preparations.</p>
      <p>“I only did a lot of physical and mental training. However, it felt like home, getting back into the car!” said Amendola.</p>
