      <p>Notts County will discover their FA Trophy opponents on Monday when the draw for the first round takes place.</p>
      <p>A trip to Wembley awaits those who make it to the final as National League sides enter the hat hopeful of a capital day out.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday night, the new owners Christoffer and Alexander Reedtz were asked in a fans’ forum whether they would love a trip to Wembley.</p>

      <p>Last year’s winners AFC Fylde will be hoping to retain their trophy under their new manager Jim Bentley.</p>
      <p>They beat Leyton Orient 1-0 under the arch last May thanks to a wonderful free-kick from striker Danny Rowe.</p>
