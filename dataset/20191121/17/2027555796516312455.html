      <h1>Govt refers surrogacy bill to select committee of RS</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The government on Thursday referred the surrogacy bill to a select committee of the Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>Union health minister Harsh Vardhan moved a resolution in the upper house of Parliament referring the bill to a select committee.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha members had on Wednesday sought amendments in certain provisions of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, that seeks to ban commercial surrogacy in India.</p>
      <p>The bill only allows a close relative to act as a surrogate to couples who have been legally married for at least five years.</p>
