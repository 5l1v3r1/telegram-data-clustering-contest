      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>India take on Bangladesh in their 1st ever Pink ball Test in Kolkata</li>
        <li>Kolkata has turned pink in the lead up to the historic Test</li>
        <li>India's pace attack likely to dominate headlines in Day-night Test</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are hardly many cities across the globe that celebrate festivals better than Kolkata. As expected, the City of Joy is gearing up for India's 1st ever Pink ball Test with a festive mood.</p>
      <p>In the part of the country where sweets are a touchy subject, <b><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/programme/in-depth/video/kolkata-pink-ball-test-india-vs-bangladesh-preparations-sg-ball-1621407-2019-11-21">pink-coloured sweets</a></b> are being sold. Famous landmarks in the city have been lit up in pink. The scenic Eden Gardens is only looking better after wearing pink.</p>
      <p>A giant-sized pink ball hangs over the Eden Gardens letting people know that the iconic venue is going to become a part of Indian cricket's history, once again! The <b><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/india-vs-bangladesh-pink-ball-test-sourav-ganguly-kolkata-decoration-eden-gardens-1621101-2019-11-21">stands at the Eden Gardens</a></b> have been equipped with pink lights.</p>
      <p>There has not been this much hype in the lead up to a Test match in India in a long, long time. BCCI president and local hero Sourav Ganguly apparently was brimming with pride when he announced that tickets for the 1st 4 days of the Test were sold out. Expect nothing less than a carnival-like atmosphere over the next 5 days in Kolkata.</p>

      <p>Cutting to on-field action, India and Bangladesh had been the only 2 top Test sides to have not played Pink-ball cricket.</p>
      <p>The announcement for the upcoming Day-night Test was also unforeseen. In the initial schedule, the Kolkata Test was a day-game but things changed quickly after Ganguly took over as BCCI president.</p>
      <p>India had been reluctant to get a taste of the Pink ball experiment for over 4 years but Sourav Ganguly said it took him just 3 seconds <b><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/india-vs-bangladesh-day-night-test-bcci-sourav-ganguly-virat-kohli-3-seconds-1615166-2019-11-02">to convince India captain Virat Kohli</a></b> for playing the Day-night Test.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, both India and Bangladesh players don't have a lot of competitive pink-ball experience. In fact, captain <b><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/day-night-test-india-cricketers-pink-ball-experience-stats-virat-kohli-pujara-1620619-2019-11-19">Virat Kohli hasn't played</a></b> a competitive Pink ball match yet.</p>
      <p>The likes of Mayank Agarwal and Cheteshwar Pujara along with Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja and others have played Pink ball matches in Duleep Trophy but it will be the 1st time they will play with the SG Pink ball.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Solid buildup to the Pink ball Test</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite lamenting the lack of practice matches, both India and Bangladesh have made the best use of the time that was available in the lead-up to the Pink ball Test. The players from the 2 teams started training with the Pink balls as early as the Indore Test which India won by an innings and 130 runs.</p>

      <p>India also stayed back in Indore after the early end to the 1st Test to train under lights at the Holkar Stadium. Over the last 2 days, India and Bangladesh have been involved in full-fledged training sessions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Teams cautious about the unknowns surrounding the Pink ball</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Pink ball Test is an exciting prospect but the unknowns surrounding the Pink ball are going to add spice to what looks like a mismatch on paper.</p>
      <p>India were dominant in the 1st Test against Bangladesh, outplaying them in all the departments. In fact, the Indore Test was over in less than 3 days despite India being butter-fingered on the field.</p>
      <p>The Pink ball's tendency to do a lot more in the air under the lights has been a challenge for batsmen in Day-night Tests so far. The visibility (or the lack of it) in the twilight session has also been a slight cause of concern in the past. It's going to be interesting to see how SG has addressed the issues in its latest version of the pink cherry.</p>
      <p>Captain Virat Kohli, while addressing the press on the eve of the Eden Gardens Test, said the extra glaze on the Pink ball makes it feel a bit heavier. "It felt like a heavy hockey ball," Kohli said. He hinted that catching might not be easy with the Pink ball while also stressing on the visibility issues.</p>
      <p>
        <b>India pacers + Pink ball = Lethal combination</b>
      </p>
      <p>While captains and the support staff were cautious in their approach, the battery of pace bowlers will be licking their lips to have a go at the opposition batsmen with the pink ball.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Shami. Ishant Sharma. Umesh Yadav. The Indian pace trio, arguably the best going around, is going to be Bangladesh's nightmare.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque conceded the challenge that Bangladesh will face when they face the 'world-class' Indian pace trio. Wriddhiman Saha, India's wicketkeeper-batsman, flaunted the team's pace attack, saying its leader, Shami can cause trouble regardless of the ball colour and the pitch.</p>
      <p>Pink may well turn out to the new colour of danger signs for Bangladesh if Shami &amp; Co. get going with the pink SG in hand.</p>
