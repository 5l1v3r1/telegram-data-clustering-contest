      <p>The Karnataka High Court on Thursday directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect RMZ Infinity, a software tech park on Old Madras Road, to ascertain the noise levels.</p>
      <p>A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Pradeep Singh Oka issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition filed in 2016 by residents of neighbouring Sadanandanagar complaining about noise pollution by the tech park operations.</p>
      <p>The Bench said the inspection should be carried out both during day and night without any prior information to the tech park authorities.</p>
