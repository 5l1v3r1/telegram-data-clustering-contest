      <h1>Nottingham Forest boss Sabri Lamouchi provides injury update ahead of Bristol City test</h1>
      <h2>The latest news on availability of Alfa Semedo, Carl Jenkinson, Michael Hefele, Yohan Benalouane and Samba Sow</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest have been boosted by the return of Alfa Semedo, Carl Jenkinson, Yohan Benalouane and Michael Hefele to training.</p>
      <p>But boss <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a> has hinted Saturday’s trip to Bristol City may come too soon for the quartet as he is keen not to take any risks with his players.</p>
      <p>Defender <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/michael-dawson">Michael Dawson</a> will be in the travelling squad, having missed the clash with Derby County before the international break as a precaution.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest </a>boss must decide whether to bring the Reds skipper straight back into the starting line-up or stick with the XI which made it back-to-back wins by beating the Rams at the City Ground.</p>
      <p>“Michael will be with us,” said the Frenchman. “We have training on Friday, but he will travel to Bristol and he will be in the squad.</p>
      <p>“Maybe we will stick with the same team. Maybe. We will see.</p>
      <p>“Michael, at this point two weeks ago, he didn’t want to take a risk. He had just had a few sessions before <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottinham-forest-derby-county-analysis-3521884">the Derby game.</a></p>
      <p>“Now, with more time, it is totally different.</p>
      <p>“With him and with the others, we need to take maximum precautions because our squad is not so big. And we will start from now, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-championship-promotion-prospects-3556986">the worst time with a lot of games</a> - starting with this next week when we have three games to play.”</p>

      <p>Dawson has not featured in the Garibaldi since the victory at Stoke City in September, having been sidelined with a calf problem.</p>
      <p>Semedo (back) has also been absent for the past couple of months, while Jenkinson (ankle) has not featured since August and Benalouane (back) and Hefele (Achilles) are yet to make an appearance this season.</p>
      <p>Lamouchi says it has been a positive <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-double-injury-3560672">having them back involved</a> during the break as Forest look to maintain their momentum when they take on the Robins.</p>
      <p>“We just try to keep the players focused and ready during the training sessions,” he said. “You don’t need to put more pressure on them.</p>
      <p>“This week, especially the first session, it was very, very good; very intense and very positive.</p>
      <p>“It has been a very good week, with players back, like Alfa Semedo, Carl Jenkinson, Yohan Benalouane and Michael Hefele.</p>
      <p>“That is good news.</p>
      <p>“The physio room and the dressing room are very close, so they are always with us.</p>
      <p>“But to train with us, to travel with us, to stay during the game and the weekend with us is totally different.</p>

      <p>“It is very important for them, but also for us and for me to have more options.</p>
      <p>“Dawson, Semedo, Jenkinson, Benalouane and Hefele, they made all the sessions with us this week. But it is so early for them.”</p>
      <p>And it is still too soon for midfielder <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/samba-sow">Samba Sow</a>, who suffered a hamstring problem in the victory over Brentford last month.</p>
      <p>“I think the next week he will be part of the sessions with us, so he is very close,” Lamouchi added.</p>
      <p>“He is close to being back with the first-team.”</p>
