      <h1>Crystal Palace vs Liverpool prediction and odds as tough test awaits Reds at Selhurst Park</h1>
      <h2>Our Palace v Liverpool betting preview suggests Reds may struggle to keep it clean at Selhurst Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:34:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author">David Prentice</a></address>
      <p>Crystal Palace have drawn the short straw this weekend, the latest team with the opportunity to try and derail the Liverpool express.</p>
      <p>But Martin Kelly and Andros Townsend have already made brave noises ahead of the Selhurst Park showdown.</p>
      <p>And, of course, just five years ago it was Palace who ended the Reds' Premier League title charge under Brendan Rodgers.</p>
      <p>Can Roy's boys do the same again? We asked our Palace correspondent <b>Robert Warlow</b> for his views.</p>
      <h3>Win, lose or draw?</h3>
      <p>Palace have a history of troubling the big clubs, but it is hard to look past Liverpool given their current form. That is why they are <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139797/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">1/2 with thepools.com</a> </b>. Defeat for the Eagles.</p>
      <h3>Who's a good bet for 1st scorer?</h3>
      <p>Sadio Mane has been in fine form this season, and he has a good record against Palace as well. He's <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139797/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">7/2</a> </b>to open the scoring and <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139797/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">11/10</a> </b>to score at any time in the match.</p>
      <h3>Who's on the naughty step?</h3>
      <p>Luka Milivojevic leads the way for the number of yellow cards this season with six. That could become seven this weekend.</p>
      <h3>Who's on pens?</h3>
      <p>Milivojevic. Which makes his <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139797/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">12/1</a> </b>to open the scoring and <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139797/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">4/1</a> </b>to score at any time both good bets.</p>
      <h3>Will Palace keep a clean sheet?</h3>
      <p>It is unlikely. Palace have played Manchester City, Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea in recent weeks, and conceded two against each of them. They will do well to stop Liverpool from doing the same. But can they breach the Reds' defence? Both Teams To Score and Liverpool to win is <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139797/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">2/1</a> </b>is a great call, given Liverpool's last clean sheet was at Bramall Lane on September 18, nine games ago.</p>
