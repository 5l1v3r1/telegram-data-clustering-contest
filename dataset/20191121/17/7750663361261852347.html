      <h1>Brighton forward Aaron Connolly still out with groin problem</h1>
      <h2>Brighton boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/graham-potter/"><b>Graham Potter</b></a> hopes <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aaron-connolly/"><b>Aaron Connolly</b></a> will not face too long on the sidelines.</h2>

      <p>The 19-year-old forward was forced to pull out of international duty with the senior Republic of Ireland squad because of a groin injury.</p>
      <p>Connolly had impressed for the Seagulls before he picked up the problem during the 3-1 defeat at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Potter, though, remains optimistic the young talent will soon be back in action, potentially in time for the trip to Anfield.</p>
      <p>"Aaron Connolly will miss the game this weekend with the same groin problem from the Manchester United game," the Brighton manager said at a press conference. "Hopefully he will be back for next weekend."</p>
      <p>Belgian winger <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/leandro-trossard/"><b>Leandro Trossard</b></a>, though, is expected to be involved after sitting out the Euro 2020 qualifying fixture in Russia.</p>
      <p>"Leandro Trossard rolled his ankle while he was away â€“ it was more precautionary that he was left out," Potter said. "He's trained with us and he's fine for the weekend."</p>
      <p>Potter reported no other fresh injury concerns following the international break, but captain Lewis Dunk will miss the Leicester match through suspension after the defender collected a fifth caution.</p>
      <p>"Shane Duffy and Davy Propper are also back fine. (Steven) Alzate got back late last night, but he is okay too," the Brighton boss added.</p>
      <p>"Bernardo has been back in training this week, but the weekend is too soon for him."</p>
      <p>Potter hopes defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-webster/"><b>Adam Webster</b></a> could be in contention for the first time since suffering an ankle injury against Norwich at the start of November.</p>
      <p>"It's a lot earlier than expected," Potter said. "He's trained today (Thursday) and we will see how he is tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"We have good options in that area of the field."</p>
      <p>Brighton saw their quest for a third consecutive Premier League win end against United before the international break.</p>
      <p>Potter knows his side will face another stern test of their ability against a high-flying and free-scoring Leicester side.</p>
      <p>"Leicester have been in good form recently and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jamie-vardy/"><b>Jamie Vardy</b></a> has been very clinical lately," the Seagulls boss said.</p>
      <p>"But he'd be the first to say that it's as much about the team behind him too that are creating chances for him."</p>
