      <h1>Lamborghini Teases All-New Model</h1>
      <h2>The House of the Raging Bull will showcase its new concept in Monaco this weekend.</h2>

      <p>By now, it seems that every automaker in the business has designed its own <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/jaguar-reveals-stunning-1000-hp-concept">Vision Gran Turismo concept</a>. Arguably one of the most obvious candidates, though, has stayed out of that particular race until now. But that's about to change.</p>
      <p>That automaker, as you might have guessed by now, is Lamborghini. The manufacturer is known, of course, for its outlandish supercars – the very kind that's proven most popular in video games and racing simulators like those in the Gran Turismo franchise. And it'll reveal its new virtual concept car specifically designed for the game this Sunday.</p>

      <p>Previewed in this rather cryptic and brief teaser clip, Lamborghini's otherwise as-yet unnamed Vision Gran Turismo concept is set to be unveiled during the World Final event of the FIA GT Championships for e-racing in Monaco on November 24. All the teaser appears to show are the taillights and rear wing, but they look rather aggressive in typical Lambo fashion – something along the lines of <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/veneno">the Veneno's</a>, but clearly of its own unique design.</p>
      <p>Once it is revealed and introduced to the virtual paddock in Gran Turismo Sport, the Lamborghini concept will join a long list of Vision Gran Turismos already available in the game.</p>

      <p>The list of Vision concepts available to "drive" in Gran Turismo Sport numbers over two dozen, including entries from Lamborghini's Volkswagen Group sister-brands Audi, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/presenting-the-insanely-awesome-bugatti-vision-gran-turismo">Bugatti</a>, and VW – not to mention rivals like <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/aston-martin-unveils-dp100-vision-gran-turismo">Aston Martin</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/mclaren-building-1130-hp-vision-gt-concept">McLaren</a>.</p>
      <p>The House That Ferruccio Built is, of course, also well represented with versions of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/huracan">Huracan</a>, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/aventador">Aventador</a>, Veneno, Miura, Countach, and Diablo. This will just be its first vehicle designed specifically for the game, and we (along with the 8 million or so gamers who've bought copies of Gran Turismo Sport) are looking forward to seeing how it shapes up... even if it's never actually built in the metal and carbon.</p>
