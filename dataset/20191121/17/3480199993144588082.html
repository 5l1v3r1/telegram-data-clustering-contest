      <p>The judge who sentenced him saw photographs from the restaurant and said it was the worst such case he had ever seen.</p>
      <p>Telford Oriental in Overdale was inspected twice this year and found to have "extremely poor" hygiene standards.</p>
      <p>The first inspection on January 31 actually took place after Telford &amp; Wrekin Council's environmental health officers visited the restaurant for a gas safety check.</p>
      <p>Once they saw the extent of the poor hygiene in the kitchen the focus of the inspection changed, Telford Magistrates Court heard this week.</p>

      <p>Jian He, 37, had been the registered manager since 2015 and was present for the inspection.</p>
      <p>Julie Fisher prosecuted the case on behalf of Telford &amp; Wrekin Council and read out the long list of shortcomings the inspectors found during their visit.</p>
      <p>She told the court of food spatters on walls and on equipment, rice cookers and other containers left on the floor, and an open container with a scoop lying in it.</p>
      <p>Inspectors found mould-covered seals in the doors of fridges and freezers, food debris on walls, floors and work surfaces, and even a greasy cardboard box that was used to store prawn crackers.</p>
      <p>"The general condition of the kitchen was extremely dirty," said Miss Fisher.</p>

      <p>The hand wash basin in the kitchen had no soap and was full of utensils which had to be removed before an inspector could wash her hands.</p>
      <p>The restaurant was given a hygiene rating of 1 and Mr He was told to make "major improvements" before re-inspection.</p>
      <p>The follow-up appointment was in March, and inspectors found "very little improvement", said Miss Fisher.</p>
      <p>Mr He was served with a prohibition notice for the business and later interviewed under caution.</p>
      <p>He accepted that the standards at his restaurant were "extremely poor".</p>

      <p>This week he pleaded guilty to 11 charges of breaking food safety regulations and was fined £1,000 for each one.</p>
      <p>They included nine offences of contravening European Union hygiene rules, and two charges of failing to comply with the Health and Safety at Work Act.</p>
      <p>The latter two charges relate to trailing cables that presented a trip hazard and an electrical switch that had an exposed faceplate.</p>
      <p>Mr He was represented in court by Clare Stephens, who told the court that the restaurant was suffering staff shortages at the time of the inspections.</p>
      <p>"Mr He has pleaded guilty, he fully accepts the offences that he faces and the fact that standards have fallen far below what the general public would expect," she said.</p>
      <p>"He has been cooperative with the council throughout."</p>
      <p>Management of the restaurant has since passed to Mr He's partner, who has facilitated a deep clean of the kitchen.</p>

      <p>"All issues identified by the council have been addressed," said Miss Stephens.</p>
      <p>The restaurant has since been re-inspected and given a hygiene rating of 3.</p>
      <p>Miss Stephens said she had been told the business makes £5,000 a year.</p>
      <p>Deputy district judge David Noble said: "I have been doing this job now for a very long time. I think this is the worst case dealing with food hygiene that I've ever come across.</p>
      <p>"I do not for one moment believe that the business only makes £100 a week and I'm going to reflect the seriousness of the offences with the financial penalties I impose."</p>
      <p>The defendant, of Overdale, will pay £200 a month, a rate at which he will pay off the £11,000 in the summer of 2024.</p>
      <p>He was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of £1,233.70 and a £170 surcharge.</p>
      <p>Telford &amp; Wrekin Council said this case shows the importance of the work done by its inspectors.</p>
      <p>Angie Astley, assistant director of customer and neighbourhood services for the council said: "Cases like this show the importance of the work done by our officers in protecting the public we serve in the borough.</p>
      <p>"Our officers carry out hundreds of inspections every year covering a number of safety issues.</p>
      <p>"What began as a gas safety inspection became a major health and safety issue, including food hygiene.</p>
      <p>"Anyone visiting a food business in Telford &amp; Wrekin must feel confident that, whether it's eat in or take out, the food is stored, handled and prepared safely and hygienically."</p>
