      <h1>Heavy Montreal festival to take a year off in 2020</h1>

      <p>MONTREAL -- The Heavy Montreal festival, which has showcased heavy-metal and hard-rock acts since its inception in 2008, will take the year off in 2020, promoter Evenko anounced Thursday.</p>
      <p>Evenko officials said the decision to pause the festival for a year was not an easy one to make, but made sense in light of its plans to present more heavy metal and hard rock concerts throughout the year.</p>
      <p>"We will continue to present CRAZY rock &amp; metal concerts throughout the city and province all year round," Evenko tweeted.</p>
      <p>"We'd like to thank the fans who have supported us and we're working hard to make sure to present to you the best metal/rock shows in the world," said Nick Farkas, Evenko's vice-president of programming, concerts and events.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first year Heavy Montreal has taken off; the festival - which was initially called HEAVY MTL - was not held in 2009, the year after its inaugural edition, and again in 2017.</p>
