      <p>The Milwaukee Brewers will have a new starting catcher in 2020.</p>
      <p>Yasmani Grandal parlayed a big season with Milwaukee into a four-year, $73 million contract from the Chicago White Sox, who announced the signing of the free-agent catcher Thursday.</p>

      <p>Grandal signed a one-year, $16 million contract with the Brewers last offseason — with a mutual option, which he declined — in the hopes of cashing in this offseason in free agency. His bet on himself paid off.</p>
      <p>Grandal played 134 games at catcher for Milwaukee in 2019, with 124 starts, and appeared in 153 games overall. He had a slash line of .246/.380/.468 with 28 home runs, 79 runs, 77 RBI and 109 walks.</p>
      <p>He set a record for most home runs by a Brewers catcher and was the first Milwaukee player to walk 100+ times in a season since Prince Fielder, who did it from 2009-11. Grandal and Fielder are the only Brewers to reach triple digits in bases on balls in any year.</p>
      <p>The Brewers now must <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/wisconsin/story/milwaukee-brewers-hot-stove-primer-yasmani-grandal-mike-moustakas-eric-thames-david-stearns-offseason-free-agents-111319">figure out their plans for catcher in 2020</a>, which currently consist of Manny Pina, whose option was picked up but who was also demoted to a backup role in 2019, and prospect Jacob Nottingham, who had a cup of coffee in 2019 but struggled in Triple-A.</p>
