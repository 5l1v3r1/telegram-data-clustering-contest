          <b>Here's how our favourite Christmas ad of the year was made.Â </b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>John Lewis and Partners along with Waitrose and Partners have released an amazing video on the making of Excitable Edgard which explains to us how the lovable dragon and his story came to life.</p>
      <p>Richard Brim, Chief Creative Officer revealed how the idea of <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/christmas/edgar-excitable-dragon-toy-launches-john-lewis-christmas-advert-drops-343117"><i>Excitable Edgar</i></a> wasn't something new.</p>
      <p>He explained" "We get 300-400 scripts a year, and this one was one that we touched on a few years ago but we just couldn't get an ending."</p>

      <p>The highly anticipated Christmas ad this year wanted to focus on the gift of acceptance and thoughtful hosting and this story is told through Ava and her dragon friend Edgar, who is clearly different to everyone around him.</p>
      <p>Edgar loves Christmas, but every time he sees something Christmassy, he gets excited and can't control his fire, which can be detrimental to the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>It's mind-blowing to see the amount of work, effort and attention to detail which goes into creating the loveable ad.</p>

      <p>"The production quality on this job is just insane. It has just become a feast for the eye so every scene has got so much going on."</p>
      <p>You can watch how the brilliant ad, and of course the adorable dragon, <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/christmas/john-lewis-christmas-advert-watch-excitable-edgar-the-dragon-in-full-343109"><i>Edga</i></a>r, came to life down below.</p>
