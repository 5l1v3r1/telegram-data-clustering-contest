      <p>Lord Jamar came through for yet another VladTV interview, and this time around he shared his thoughts on everything from DJ Vlad's tweet about reparations to the Kardashians monetizing their kids. He also shared his thoughts on the Mexican government freeing El Chapo's son after his arrest when a town was set ablaze during a shootout between the police and the cartel. The conversation then turned to the Nine Trey Bloods and BMF both being brought down by phone taps, which led to a discussion about cell phones being cloned and tapped with today's technology. To hear more, including Lord Jamar's love of the Wu-Tang series, <i>Wu-Tang: An American Saga, </i>hit the full interview above.</p>
