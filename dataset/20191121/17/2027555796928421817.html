      <h1>Kerala farmer's jackfruit helps Brazil's R-Day fest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:27:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/arjun-raghunath" target="_blank">Arjun Raghunath</a></address>
      <p>A jackfruit farmer at Thrissur in central Kerala received an unexpected call last week from the Embassy of Brazil in New Delhi seeking immediate supply of jackfruits.</p>
      <p>Varghese Tharakan, who had already received much attention with his Ayurjack farm that offers jackfruits round the year, received the call. Jackfruits are an integral ingredient of Brazilian deserts.</p>
      <p>The Embassy needed it to prepare a dessert to be served in a get together in connection with Brazil's Republic Day celebrations on November 19, said the Brazilian Embassy staff.</p>
      <p>The next day, November 15, Tharakan received an email from the deputy chief of mission Breno Hermann making a formal request for the jackfruits.</p>
      <p>"It was indeed a very happy moment for me. Over 60 kgs of jackfruit was dispatched immediately to the Embassy," said Tharakan, who only charged the dispatch cost.</p>
      <p>An automobile diploma holder, Tharakan opted for a career in farming owing to his interest in the field. While normal jackfruit trees offer only one yield annually, Tharakan developed a new variety through budding, offering two yields in a year and named it Ayurjack.</p>
      <p>He brought five acres of land at Veloor village, about 20 km from Thrissur town, in 2003 and started developing the jackfruit farm, which became full-fledged with water management plans a few years ago.</p>
      <p>At present, there are over 1,000 jackfruit trees in the five-acre farm and about lakh saplings growing in various stages. Tharakan has received enquiries from various foreign institutions.</p>
