      <p>Two Richmond men have been found to have committed fraud by operating a Ponzi scheme which raised about $5 million from investors.</p>
      <p>The British Columbia Securities Commission has found John Bezzasso raised $5 million from 85 investors through his companies, Bezzaz Holdings Group Ltd. and Nexus Global Trading Ltd.</p>
      <p>Bezzasso enlisted the help of fellow Richmond resident Wei Kai (a.k.a. Kevin) Liao to find investors on his behalf.</p>
      <p>According to the BCSC, investors were shown promotional material for Bezzaz indicating it owned Nexus, a company contracted to distribute certain brands of alcohol in B.C.</p>
      <p>Promotional material also indicated that Bezzaz sold a variety of products, including health supplements and e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>In return for investing in Bezzaz, investors were promised rates of return between five per cent and 30 per cent, payable through post-dated cheques.</p>
      <p>The panel found that instead of using investor funds as promised, Bezzasso was actually operating a Ponzi scheme.</p>
      <p>A large portion of the investorsâ€™ funds were being used to pay earlier investors, meaning many people who invested later during the scheme lost some, or all, of their money.</p>
