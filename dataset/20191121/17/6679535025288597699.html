      <h2>Udupi farmers have grown sugarcane on 70 acres of land</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:52:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Ganesh-Prabhu-1555/" target="_blank">Ganesh Prabhu</a></address>
      <p>Although farmers in Udupi district have grown sugarcane on 70 acres of land in the hope that the State government would revive the ailing Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory, lack of efforts towards the same has dampened their enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>The foundation stones for both the Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory and the Varahi Irrigation Project were laid in 1980 on the premise that the latter would support the former.</p>
      <p>While the factory started functioning in 1985, the first phase of the irrigation project was completed in 2015. However, the factory closed down in 2004 owing to heavy losses. In the meantime, several half-hearted efforts were made for its revival which ended in naught.</p>
      <p>In 2018, H.D. Kumaraswamy, then Chief Minister, promised the farmers of Udupi district that he would revive the factory provided they started cultivating sugarcane.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the factory management, along with farm organisations, urged the farmers to grow cane. As a result, the farmers cultivated sugarcane on 70 acres this March.</p>
      <p>Satyanarayana Udupa, secretary of district unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, told <i>The Hindu</i> that the plan was to extend the cultivation to 1,800 acres in the second year and to over 8,000 acres in the third year, by which time the management and farmers groups expected the factory to be revived.</p>
      <p>“But there is not much enthusiasm among farmers as they mistrust the government given their previous experience. Some want the factory to start functioning and then they would start cane cultivation,” he said.</p>
      <p>Those who cultivated cane in the district will harvest the crop in February-March, 2020. The farmers who have already cultivated will not be in trouble.</p>
      <p>While sugarcane juice producing units have agreed to take cane from 20 acres, those cultivated in the rest 50 acres will be taken by a Mandya-based jaggery manufacturing unit.</p>
      <p>“All the legislators of Udupi district should put pressure on State government to start the factory. So far, all their attempts have been half-hearted. Some vested interests are eying the 110 acres of land of the factory to be given to industries. We will not allow that to happen. Sugarcane cultivation is more profitable than paddy and will help farmers,” Mr. Udupa added.</p>
