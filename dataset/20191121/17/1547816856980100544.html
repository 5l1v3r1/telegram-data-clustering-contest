        <b>Bigg Boss 13 Ka Naya Vaar. It's mostly getting a 3 / 4 week EXTENSION. Colors has almost taken the decision. Bigg Boss fans can celebrate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Love it or hate it, Bigg Boss 13 is most likely getting an EXTENSION of 3 to 4 weeks. This implies then that it might not culminate in January as per the original plan but may stretch till February 2020. Remember you read it on SpotboyE.com FIRST.</p>
      <p>Bigg Boss has always been a newsmaker and it managed to engage viewers by embroiling celebs in controversies, and at times even creating new ones. And you know we love being Peeping Toms. Remember Pran saying in the unforgettable Amitabh Bachchan starrer Majboor- 'mujhe logon ke gharon mein jhaankne ki aadat si ho gayi hai'! Yaar, hum bhi to aise hi hain, accept it.</p>

      <p>Toh haan hua yeh hai jaise ki we told you in our HIT OR FLOP column (which appears every Thursday) this afternoon that Bigg Boss 13 has finally managed to get into the Top 10 TV shows on Indian television in the coveted list that came to us this morning. Now who does not want to capitalise? But honestly speaking, even otherwise, the show's broadcaster Colors was contemplating to extend it. The past two weeks have been very thrilling for especially those who love fights- as I say, it's a case of 'it's all happening out there'. Who knows, Endemol (producer) officials might be dancing in the aisles.</p>
      <p>So yes, there might be some new entries or some new permutations and combinations of tasks. The ball has to roll longer.</p>

      <p>Anyway, I must tell you, in fact, I think I have told you that the Fourth Season was my favourite- that Dolly Bindra-Shweta Tiwari fight I can NEVER forget. Baaki sab uske saamne kitni chhoti aur kai baar nakli bhi lagti hain. Anyway, I am digressing. You see, I was waiting for Colors to revert on this latest goss of extension that I heard.</p>
      <p>Time to put on my AC, grab a cup of hot tea and settle down to see Sony's Crime Patrol Satark which I never miss.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/colorstv/</i><i>asimriaz77.official/parasvchhabrra/artisingh5/justdial/prokerela/voot</i></p>
