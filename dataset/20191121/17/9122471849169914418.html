      <h1>The 2 Favorites To Trade For Panthers QB Cam Newton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:18:55+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>It doesn’t happen often, but it’s possible that a former NFL MVP is available for trade this offseason. Despite all of his success in Carolina, all signs point to Cam Newton playing in a different town next season.</p>
      <p>Newton has missed all but two games this year due to a foot injury. Unfortunately for the former No. 1 pick, he’s dealt with a plethora of injuries over the past few years.</p>
      <p>Carolina has a few options at quarterback next season. Management could roll the dice on Kyle Allen for another season, or they could hand the keys over to Will Grier.</p>
      <p>Either way, it sounds like the days of Newton leading the Panthers are over.</p>
      <p>Since the Panthers have depth at quarterback and seem ready to move on from Newton, the Pro Bowler could be on the move.</p>
      <p>In the event that Carolina does trade Newton, there are two teams that are in the lead to acquire him.</p>
      <p>Betting odds have the Chicago Bears listed as the favorites to trade for Newton. The Cincinnati Bengals have the second-best odds.</p>

      <p>The most interesting suitor on this list are the New England Patriots. Newton would be quite the successor to Tom Brady.</p>
      <p>Where do you think Cam Newton will play next year?</p>
