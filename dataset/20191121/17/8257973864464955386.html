      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Israeli prosecutors indicted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust -- following a lengthy investigation the Israeli leader has dismissed as a "witch hunt."</p>
      <p>Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit's <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-netanyahu-indictment-imminent-bribery-fraud-or-breach-of-trust-1.8160019">move to charge</a> Netanyahu sides with long-running police investigations involving three cases. Mandelblit <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-pm-netanyahu-indicted-charges-bribery-fraud-breach-trust-n1084831?cid=eml_nbn_20191121">said he consulted</a> with more than 20 senior legal officials about the investigations, known as cases 1000, 2000 and 4000.</p>
      <p>Case 1000 involves gifts received by the prime minister; case 2000 says Netanyahu paid for favorable news coverage from the publisher of an Israeli newspaper; case 4000 says he made regulatory moves to benefit news outlet Walla in exchange for favorable coverage.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu hoped to pass legislation to sidestep the indictment, but it hasn't happened -- partly because he hasn't been able to form a governing coalition after elections in April and September. The Israeli Knesset <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/21/Israeli-Knesset-given-unprecedented-mandate-to-form-coalition-govt/8711574352169/?sl=3">is now tasked</a> with the job.</p>
      <p>The indictment adds uncertainty to Netanyahu's political future. If Rivlin again askes him to try and form a coalition, he would become the first Israeli prime minister under indictment to do so.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu's attorneys said <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/10/02/Netanyahu-attorneys-confident-as-pre-indictment-trial-begins/5911570013700/">last month</a> they were confident corruption charges would be dropped. The prime minister has rejected claims of wrongdoing, saying they are part of a campaign waged by his political enemies.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu has served two stints as Israeli prime minister, with the present tenure beginning in 2009.</p>
