      <p>United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has tasked government on quality education, healthcare and a fair chance for every child.</p>
      <p>According to Field Officer, UNICEF Lagos, Mr Muhammad Okorie, quality education and good health care are key requirement for children to achieve their full potentials.</p>
      <p>He made the observation while speaking to The Nation on UNICEF’s activities marking the Child Right Convention (CRC) on Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>“Despite the gains in the situation of children and young people globally, including Nigeria in recent years, much remains to be done. Too many Nigerian children and young people are being left behind, marginalised or abused,” he said.</p>

      <p>He, therefore, urged that government should ensure the rights of the convention are protected and implemented for every child as the world is marking the CRC@30 anniversary.</p>
      <p>“The world is marking the 30th anniversary of the CRC@30, which Nigeria has ratified and pledged to uphold. It is not compulsory that everybody must be an academic but basic education and literacy is very necessary for one to succeed in whatever one wants to become,” Okorie said.</p>
      <p>To mark the day, UNICEF also released a song on the rights of the child to mark the day.</p>
