When he returned three days later they caught him and tried to hold him, but he managed to escape.</p>
      <p>He was arrested on December 7 and confessed, but while the case was investigated, he went on to commit thefts and an attempted burglary at a working men’s club.</p>
      <p>Defending, Sharon Watson asked the sentencing to be adjourned to November 29 for a probation report, and revealed two years ago he had a stable relationship and a full time job earning £24,000 a year managing a call centre.</p>
      <p>She said after his separation, he met another woman who was a drug addict.</p>
      <p>She added: “He became addicted to crack cocaine and his life spiralled out of control. Since he’s been on remand he’s been detoxing.</p>
      <p>“It’s his first experience of custody and has been a wake up call.”</p>
