      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a> have been handed a big funding boost in the first week of the election campaign after receiving large donations worth 26 times the amount received by Labour.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson’s party raised more than £5.67m in large donations – defined as amounts of more than £7,500 – compared with £218,500 given to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a>, according to official figures.</p>
      <p>Tory donors included the wife of a Russian businessman, property developers and a theatre producer. They contributed to a £1.5m increase in the amount raised by the Conservatives from large donors over the same period in 2017.</p>
      <p>Figures released by the Electoral Commission showed that the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party both raised more than Labour, with £275,000 and £250,000 respectively.</p>
      <p>In total, £6,507,146 in donations was reported to the elections watchdog between 6 and 12 November. This was more than £500,000 less than for the same period in 2017.</p>
      <p>Most of the donations to Labour come in smaller amounts from individuals and are not required to be registered by the elections watchdog.</p>
      <p>Tory donors specified in the new data include Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband Vladimir was formerly a minister in the Russian government of Vladimir Putin. He has subsequently said he has fallen out with the Russian leader.</p>
      <p>This time, she has donated £200,000 in cash. Previously, she had successfully bid at Tory auctions to spend time with senior politicians <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/03/tennis-cameron-johnson-160000-tory-fundraiser">including a £160,000 bid to play tennis with Boris Johnson</a> and a successful <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/may/02/what-would-you-pay-not-to-go-on-a-ladies-night-with-theresa-may-and-her-chums">£135,000 bid for a </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/may/02/what-would-you-pay-not-to-go-on-a-ladies-night-with-theresa-may-and-her-chums">night out with Theresa May</a> and other senior cabinet ministers.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the Conservatives accepted £30,000 from her in return for a private dinner with Gavin Williamson, then the defence secretary, in the Churchill War Rooms.</p>
      <p>The biggest backer of the Conservatives for this election was the theatre producer John Gore, who gave £1m.</p>
      <p>The next three largest donors were the travel company Trailfinders, Countrywide Developers and WA Capital, which each gave £500,000 to the party. Countrywide Developers is owned by the property billionaire Tony Gallagher.</p>
      <p>Gore, who grew up in Southport, Merseyside, has an estimated wealth of £1.5bn made by staging musicals such as Hamilton, Wicked, Chicago and School of Rock. <br/><br/>He told the Sunday Times in May that he began donating to the Conservatives in 2017 because he wished to stop “extreme demagogues” from achieving power. “It’s not unlike being a director. I can see this show is really going wrong – that it’s going to crash,” he said.<br/><br/>Other Tory donors include Malcolm Offord, a private equity tycoon who spent 16 years at the buyout firm Charterhouse before retiring at the end of 2013.<br/><br/>A firm led by the Ukrainian-born businessman Alexander Temerko, Aquind Ltd, gave two donations to the Tories worth a total of £67,000. Earlier this week, the company submitted plans for a privately funded £1.1bn electricity link between the UK and France. <br/><br/>Jeremy Corbyn has used the Tories’ reliance upon wealthy donors as a rallying cry among his supporters. “A third of Britain’s billionaires have donated to the Conservative party,” he told activists on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Unite the union has given five separate donations to Labour totalling £213,000, making it the party’s largest donor. <br/><br/>A Labour spokesman said: “While the Conservative party is in the pockets of vested interests and the super-rich, we are proud that the Labour party is funded by hundreds of thousands of people donating what they can afford.”</p>
