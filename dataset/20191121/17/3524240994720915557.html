      <p>On Wednesday, the Lagos State government admitted that the traffic situation in the state has deteriorated, even as it assured motorists and commuters that the situation would not last for long.</p>
      <p>The assurance notwithstanding, criminal elements in the city have been taking advantage of the terrible traffic situation to dispossess Lagosians of their valuables.</p>
      <p>Below are a few tips on how to stay safe while in traffic:</p>
      <p>1. Security experts encourage motorists to keep their valuables (phones, bags, laptops etc) out of plain sight.</p>
      <p>2. According to security outfit, <i><a href="http://www.sheriffdeputiesltd.com/everyday-security-staying-safe-in-traffic/">Sherrif Deputies</a></i>, motorists should keep windows up and doors locked while in traffic.</p>
      <p>3. It’s nice being a Good Samaritan, however, avoid giving rides to strangers in Lagos traffic.</p>
      <p>4. <i>Sherrif Deputies</i> also encourages effective use of the rearview mirror to monitor activities around your car</p>
      <p>5. Avoid making calls or handling your phone with your hand close to the car window. Not only is usage of phone while driving against traffic rules, it may also attract unwanted attention.</p>
      <p>6. If you can, avoid patronising street hawkers while in traffic.</p>
      <p>7. It’s true that Lagos traffic can often be a case of a bumper-to-bumper ride, however, <i><a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/public-safety/motor-vehicle-safety-theft-prevention-tips">Brown university</a></i> encourages you to leave enough distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you, so you can pull away quickly if needed.</p>
