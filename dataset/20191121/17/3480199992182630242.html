      <p>Scotland’s First Minister has insisted due process must be respected after her predecessor appeared in court on a series of sexual assault charges.</p>
      <p>Alex Salmond pleaded not guilty on Thursday to 14 separate allegations involving 10 women.</p>
      <p>He faced a charge of attempted rape, 11 charges of sexual assault – including one with intent to rape – and two charges of indecent assault.</p>
      <p>Speaking outside the High Court in Edinburgh, the former SNP leader said: “I am innocent and I will defend my position vigorously.”</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon said her only interest was that “justice is done, whatever that might be”.</p>
      <p>The current SNP leader, who was campaigning in Glasgow in the run-up to December’s General Election said: “This is a live, ongoing criminal trial so there is nothing it is appropriate for me to say, in fact there is nothing it is appropriate for anybody to say because it is absolutely essential that due process is allowed to take its course.</p>
      <p>“My only interest as First Minister and as an ordinary citizen is that justice is done – whatever that might be.</p>
      <p>“So I will say nothing that in any way might influence or prejudice that trial because it is vital that goes ahead and due process is respected.”</p>
