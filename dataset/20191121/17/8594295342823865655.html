      <h1>2020 Hyundai Ioniq: Modest Changes, but the Electric Goes to War With Nissan</h1>

      <p>No one wants to come in last. With the Volkswagen e-Golf and Smart Fortwo EQ Electric Drive Whatever discontinued, Hyundai’s compact Ioniq Electric hatchback was poised to be the lowest-range electric vehicle in the North American market (minus, of course, the limited-availability, lease-only Honda Clarity EV).</p>
      <p>Clearly, this looming position at the bottom of the ladder left a bad taste in Hyundai’s mouth. Preferring to see Nissan there, it set about making the necessary changes.</p>
      <p>For 2020, the Ionic line, which encompasses a very thrifty hybrid, a plug-in hybrid, and an EV, undergoes some mild styling changes and adds the Hyundai SmartSense suite of safety features as standard equipment. There’s a revised grille and fascia (non-electrics get mesh), plus LED lamps fore and aft on uplevel trims, side sill moldings, and revamped wheel designs.</p>

      <p>But you’re probably wondering how the Ioniq Electric, a low-priced green vehicle unlikely to grace the driveway of any TTAC reader, kicks Nissan’s ass. Well, for 2020 the model swaps its petite 28 kWh battery pack for a beefier 38.3 kWh unit. The swap elevates the vehicle’s driving range from a mediocre-at-best 124 miles to 170 miles, outclassing the base Nissan Leaf’s 151-mile range.</p>
      <p>Unlike the Leaf, however, Ioniq buyers can’t shell out extra cash for a 226-mile “Plus” variant. Oh well. At least Hyundai can boast of its base EV offering more range. While Hyundai didn’t mention Ioniq Electric pricing, the 2019 model started at $31,245 after destination and<i> before</i> a $7,500 federal tax credit. That’s $330 more than a base Leaf S.</p>

      <p>For the coming model year, the Electric also offers more grunt: 134 horsepower, compared to the previous 118 hp, though torque remains the same at 218 lb-ft. Charging speed also rises, from 6.6 kW to 7.2 kW, promising quicker battery top-ups. As for the Hybrid and PHEV, their powertrains remain unchanged.</p>
      <p>Inside all Ioniqs, the newly upgraded 8-inch touchscreen (2019MY had a 7-inch) can be binned in favor of a 10.25-inch “widescreen” with navigation (see below), while the instrument panel also undergoes a revision. A new center LCD information screen joins the fray, as do touchscreen HVAC controls. Ambient lighting is customizable.</p>
      <p>Hybrid buyers finally get the regenerative braking control paddles that eluded them up to this point.</p>

      <p>As for safety, the SmartSense features include forward collision avoidance, lane-keeping assist, high beam assist, and driver attention warning. If road trips make you nervous, highway driving assist and lane following assist are optional.</p>
      <p>Arriving in early 2017, the electrified Ioniq line hasn’t exactly set the sales charts on fire, though the past few months <i>has</i> seen the model’s volume increase noticeably. Year to date, Ioniq sales are up 33 percent.</p>
