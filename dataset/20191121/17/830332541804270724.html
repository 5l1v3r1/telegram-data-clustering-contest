      <p>CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis. - The Chippewa Falls Police Department made a fourth-offense drunken driving arrest Monday and found fake plates on the suspect's vehicle.</p>
      <p>According to a Chippewa Falls PD Facebook post, Officer Scott Schoenwetter pulled over the driver Monday and noticed the registration plates didn't match the vehicle.</p>
      <p>"Maybe they are legal in the THE LAND OF SKY BLUE WATERS just not here in Chippewa Falls!!!" police said in the Facebook post. </p>
      <p>Following a closer inspection, the officer realized the plates were made out of a case of Hamm's beer.</p>
