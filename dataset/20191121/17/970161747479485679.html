        <b>Daryl Gurney is back to defend his Players Championship Finals title this weekend, and has named last year’s triumph as the finest achievement of his career.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Superchin pulled off a stunning victory over Michael van Gerwen in the 2018 final in Minehead, downing the world number one 11-9 to get his hands on the trophy.</p>
      <p>The thrilling upset win saw the Northern Irishman pick up a second major title in the PDC after winning the 2017 World Grand Prix in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Given it is traditionally a more prestigious event and it was his first major, it would be a fair assumption that Gurney ranks the Grand Prix at the top of his list of achievements, but the fact he toppled MVG in Minehead gives that title the edge.</p>
      <p>‘I have great memories, I love that stage,’ Gurney told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>. ‘Most people say that your first one is the most special, but for me I rate the Players Championships higher than the Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘At the Grand Prix [a double-in tournament] you get free legs where you can take a breather when people miss doubles at the start.</p>
      <p>‘At the Players Championships it’s all rat-a-tat-tat, there’s no room for error, and because I beat the best player in the world to win it, it’s a bit more special.</p>
      <p>‘What I remember of it anyway, I remember until about an hour after getting the trophy then it’s all a bit blurry after that.’</p>

      <p>Gurney has picked up a European Tour and ProTour title this year and made three major semi-finals, but despite not yet picking up a major crown in 2019, he feels like his darts are better than ever and he is ready to triumph in Minehead and at the World Championship, which gets underway next month.</p>
      <p>‘2017 was my big year, but I feel like I’ve probably played my best darts this year,’ said the 33-year-old. ‘I came within a couple of legs of winning the European Championship semi-final and, with Gezzy [Gerwyn Price] saying he had nothing left in the final, I think I would have won that.</p>
      <p>‘Then I tossed away the semi-final at the Matchplay as well, and I think I would have beaten Michael Smith in the final there too.</p>
      <p>‘So I’ve been close and it’s fine margins and just a few small mistakes that I need to correct, but if I can do that then I am ready to have a good run at the Worlds.’</p>

      <p>Superchin is undoubtedly one of the contenders for the world title this time round, as he has been the last three years, although his best run at Alexandra Palace remains a quarter-final in 2017.</p>

      <p>The draw for the World Championship takes place on Monday and Gurney insists he is not too fussed who he gets in round one, but had a playful response at the suggestion he could get Raymond van Barneveld in his last ever Alexandra Palace appearance before retirement.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/28/raymond-van-barneveld-reacts-crushing-relegation-premier-league-darts-rotterdam-9042112/">already retired Barney once at the Premier League</a> so I don’t need to do it again,’ said Gurney of Barney’s brief retirement in March.</p>
      <p>‘He’s not been playing too much and probably hasn’t been playing that well, but you never know what he’s going to do at the Worlds. He could turn up and play really well, but this weekend will be a good gauge of how he’s playing.</p>
      <p>‘I think after the Worlds he’s just looking forward to those exhibitions with Phil Taylor so he can lose every week doing that.’</p>
      <p>Always happy to voice his opinion, Gurney also gave his thoughts on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/glen-durrant-michael-smith-row-disrespect-shown-grand-slam-darts-11080634/">slightly odd spat between Michael Smith and Glen Durrant</a> at the recent Grand Slam of Darts.</p>
      <p>Smith had an issue with PDC player Durrant qualifying as BDO champion for the event, which led to the pair conducting some slightly awkward interviews about each other, but Gurney is certainly coming down on Duzza’s side in this debate.</p>

      <p>‘If I had a problem I wouldn’t have done it on camera, I’d have said it to Glen’s face,’ continued Daryl. ‘Maybe Glen should have gone through the PDC qualifier so he could get the money on his ranking, but that’s up to him, for some reason he didn’t want to.</p>
      <p>‘He got the invite from the BDO and nine out of 10 players would have probably taken that route because it’s easier than going to the qualifier.</p>
      <p>‘He earned good money getting to the semi-final, it just doesn’t go on his ranking. I’m not sure what Michael Smith is crying about really, because it helps him that Glen’s money doesn’t go on his rankings.’</p>
      <p>Gurney takes on Luke Woodhouse in the first round of the Players Championship Finals on Friday evening live on ITV4.</p>
