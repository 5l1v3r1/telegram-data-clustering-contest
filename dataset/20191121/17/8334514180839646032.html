      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain urged Israel to halt its “counterproductive” settlement expansion on Thursday, saying it was illegal under international law.</p>
      <p>The Foreign Office reiterated its position on the settlements after the United States on Monday effectively backed Israel’s right to build Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p>
      <p>“The position of the UK on settlements is clear,” it said in a statement. “They are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to peace, and threaten the viability of a two-state solution. We urge Israel to halt its counterproductive settlement expansion.”</p>
