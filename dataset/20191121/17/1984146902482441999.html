      <h2>Michael Garry is facing a prison sentence after pleading guilty to making and possessing indecent or prohibited pictures of kids</h2>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> pervert is facing time behind bars after he was found with collection of vile images of children.</p>
      <p>Michael Garry, formerly of Bedlington but now living in Acklington, was found by police to have nearly 70 of the sick pictures, including 23 of the most serious kind.</p>
      <p>A court was told that the 35-year-old downloaded the photos or moving images on or before April 22 last year at his then-home in The Wynding, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bedlington">Bedlington</a> .</p>
      <p>Garry, who now lives at The Village, Acklington, appeared in the dock at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">South East Northumberland Magistrates' Court</a> on Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a prohibited image of a child and three of making indecent images of a child.</p>
      <p>James Long, prosecuting, said: "This is a matter, in any view, that is out of your powers of sentence.</p>
      <p>"There are 23 category A images, which are the most serious kind.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there's any point outlining the case to you as the charges speak for themselves."</p>
      <p>The court heard Garry also had 12 category B and 33 category C images.</p>
      <p>Kyle Patterson, defending, made no representations at this stage.</p>
      <p>Magistrates committed Garry to Newcastle Crown Court for sentence on December 19 and released him on unconditional bail until that date.</p>
