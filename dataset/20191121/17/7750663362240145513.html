      <p>Former Rugby Park favourite Fowler was appointed as Kilmarnock's first ever director of football operations earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The club's 2012 League Cup-winning captain has been tasked with leading the club's recruitment department and has already sat down with Alessio to draw up plans for the winter transfer window.</p>
      <p>And the Italian believes the fact that Fowler – who played over 400 games for Killie – knows the club so well will help them sniff out the best bargain buys.</p>
      <p>Alessio said: "James has good experience. He's a club legend here. He played here for 17 years and is a familiar person at the club.</p>
      <p>"I think he can help us in terms of scouting, recruitment, transfers, loans – everything.</p>
      <p>"It's a massive job for him but I think we can have a good relationship.</p>
      <p>"Did I think it was necessary to have someone in this role? For me it's strange because in England and Italy, there is a sporting director (in many clubs) and it's important for me in this moment.</p>
      <p>"Previously in Italy I would work very closely with the sporting director. We'd speak every day about everything.</p>
      <p>"I have to think about the market in January. It's a good challenge for James but I think he can help us.</p>
      <p>"Football has changed a lot. For me, (this set-up) is normal.</p>
      <p>"James knows things very well in Kilmarnock. For me it's a good (appointment) as we need a person for this job and James is a good fit.</p>
      <p>"I've already had a good conversation with James about (what we'll do in January). It's important I work on the pitch but also to work together with James and to do our best for the club."</p>
      <p>Killie will host a Hearts side on Saturday who still have interim boss Austin MacPhee in charge.</p>
      <p>But Alessio believes the Jambos players will be looking to put on a show in case Craig Levein's permanent successor is watching.</p>
      <p>He said: "Hearts are confident because they played well the last game against St Mirren and got the win.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes there is a reaction when you change a manager. I know this is a big challenge for my team but we are ready to play a good game.</p>
      <p>"It's normal (that the players raise their game) because every player wants to impress the new manager.</p>
      <p>"We expect this but I have to think about my team. It's important to prepare well. I know it will be difficult but every game is tough and we're ready for it."</p>
