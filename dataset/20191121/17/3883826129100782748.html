        <b>Great Britain secured their place in the knockout stage of the Davis Cup finals as Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski won their pivotal doubles match to clinch victory over Kazakhstan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Murray and Skupski, knowing Britain would be eliminated if they lost, beat Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik 6-1 6-4 in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Britain will face Germany in the quarter-finals at 16:30 GMT on Friday.</p>
      <p>Britain finished top of Group E, with Kazakhstan going out.</p>
      <p>After being drawn in a favourable group alongside the Netherlands and Kazakhstan, Britain were always expected to reach the last eight at the new season-ending finals.</p>
      <p>However, their passage was not as smooth as many may have predicted with both ties going the distance.</p>

      <p>A 2-1 win over the Dutch in their opening group tie on Wednesday meant Britain knew they had to beat the Kazakhs on Thursday to go through - a narrow 2-1 defeat would not have been enough to help them advance as one of the two best-placed runners-up.</p>
      <p>Kyle Edmund stepped up in Andy Murray's absence to give Britain the perfect start with a 6-3 6-3 win over Kukushkin in the first singles match.</p>
      <p>British number one Dan Evans, knowing victory would seal their progress, lost 5-7 6-4 6-1 to Bublik to ensure a winner-takes-all doubles match played in a boisterous atmosphere at the Caja Magica.</p>
      <p>Jamie Murray and Skupski, making his Davis Cup debut, raced through the first set in just 25 minutes before needing to break twice in the second set to secure victory.</p>
      <p>The British pair took their second match point when Kukushkin skewed wide, leaving a healthy British contingent leaping to their feet and dancing in the stands.</p>
      <p>Murray raised both hands in the air on court as Skupski jogged over to the British bench where he was mobbed by his team-mates and support staff.</p>
      <p>"We played a great match from start to finish. We started quickly, were aggressive and didn't give them time to settle," said Jamie Murray.</p>
      <p>"I don't like to give them time, that's my style and Neal did a great job, playing some great tennis. We're so happy to get to the quarter-finals."</p>
      <p>British captain Leon Smith said: "Jamie and Neal were excellent and it shows the value of having an established team who are doubles specialists playing against two singles players."</p>
      <h3>Edmund impressive but Evans falters</h3>

      <p>Andy Murray's absence was unsurprising after the Scot laboured to a three-set win over Dutch world number 179 Tallon Griekspoor on Wednesday, which left him admitting he was not as sharp as he would like to be after taking a month off competitive tennis to spend time with his new-born son and family.</p>
      <p>That placed the pressure on 24-year-old Edmund, at the end of a year in which he struggled for wins and tumbled down the world rankings as a result.</p>
      <p>But Edmund, the 2018 Australian Open semi-finalist who has dropped to 69th in the world, outplayed 67th-ranked Kukushkin in a noisy Caja Magica.</p>
      <p>Kukushkin was backed by about 100 boisterous and colourful fans, armed with drums and a trombone like they were when their women's team played Britain in the Fed Cup earlier this year.</p>
      <p>However, that did not put off Edmund, who showed no signs of the troubles which have plagued him on the ATP Tour this year.</p>
      <p>The Yorkshireman's explosive forehand - his key weapon - was particularly destructive, helping him hit 10 aces and 23 winners in a dominant performance.</p>
      <p>After breaking again for a 4-2 lead in the second set, he took eight of the last nine points to race through the closing stages, converting his first match point when Kukushkin hit a forehand long.</p>
      <p>"Kyle did a terrific job and, as I said yesterday, I had every confidence he would go out and play well. He was excellent," said Smith.</p>
      <p>"Andy wasn't at his best on the court. And it's tough to recover from that as well.</p>
      <p>"When you've got someone like Kyle as an option, for me it was obvious to go and use him in that situation."</p>
      <p>Edmund's triumph meant Evans had the opportunity to seal Britain's place in the quarter-finals but, like during his defeat by top-ranked Dutchman Robin Haase, he faltered from a winning position.</p>
      <p>Evans, 29, is ranked as Britain's top male player after a strong season which has seen him climb back into the top 50 and earn main-draw victories at three of the four Grand Slams.</p>
      <p>However, another fightback by an inspired opponent leaves him without a victory in the Spanish capital so far.</p>
      <p>Smith backed Evans to "find a way" to win on a court which he believes suits the player's game, saying if he had served out victory against Haase on Wednesday then everything "would be fine".</p>
