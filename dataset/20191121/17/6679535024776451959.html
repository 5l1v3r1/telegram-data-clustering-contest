      <p>Israel’s attorney-general indicted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges on November 21, heightening uncertainty over who will ultimately lead a country mired in political chaos after two inconclusive elections this year.</p>
      <p>Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit announced the decision, the first of its kind against a serving Israeli Prime Minister, in a statement and said the charges included bribery, breach of trust and fraud.</p>
      <p>Mr. Netanyahu, who has denied wrongdoing in three corruption cases, is under no legal obligation to resign after being charged. He was due to make a statement at 2 a.m. IST on November 22.</p>
      <p>Police recommended in February that Mr. Mandelblit file criminal charges against the right-wing prime minister in the long-running investigations dubbed Cases 1000, 2000 and 4000.</p>
      <p>Mr. Netanyahu is suspected of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts, which prosecutors said included cigars and champagne, from tycoons and of dispensing favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by Israel’s biggest selling newspaper, <i>Yedioth Ahronoth</i>, and the <i>Walla</i> website.</p>
