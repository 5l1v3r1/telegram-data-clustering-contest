      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on Thursday indicted on corruption charges.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit issued an indictment charging Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and bribery, AP <a href="https://apnews.com/1375ee13c08a463c9234a3298c390b8c?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and said he is a victim of a witch hunt.</p>
      <p>One case against the prime minister involves allegations of receiving gifts from billionaires, allegedly in exchange for favors. In another, Netanyahu is accused of colluding with the country’s top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, to hurt its competition in exchange for favorable coverage. In a third case, Netanyahu is accused of offering incentives to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on an online news website it owns.</p>
      <p>In September, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/netanyahu-alliance-fails-to-win-majority-in-repeat-election/">Netanyahu and his allies</a> failed to garner a majority of seats in parliament, as Israelis went to the ballot box for the second time in a year following an inconclusive election in April.</p>
