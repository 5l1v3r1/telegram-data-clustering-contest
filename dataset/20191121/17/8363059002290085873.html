      <h1>RoboCop Returns Has a New Director Who Knows a Thing or Two About Bringing People Back From the Dead</h1>

      <p><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> didn’t exactly set the box office on fire, but its tactic of ignoring certain franchise entries and calling itself a direct sequel (see also: 2018's <i>Halloween</i>) still holds tons of promise. Now <i>RoboCop</i> is moving forward with its own long-teased attempt at this, with an intriguing new director.</p>
      <p>Australian director Abe Forsythe, who made the Lupita Nyong’o zombie comedy <i>Little Monsters</i> and obviously has the necessary stomach for cinematically gushing gore, has just come aboard the project, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robocop-returns-lands-little-monsters-director-abe-forsythe-1256699">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>. <i>RoboCop </i>fans will already know that he’s filling the vacancy left by <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-small-update-on-the-new-robocop-movie-which-is-appar-1835991029">Neill Blomkamp</a>, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-small-update-on-the-new-robocop-movie-which-is-appar-1835991029">who tweeted in June that the script was being written</a>, but then <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478152/robocop-returns-just-lost-its-director-so-what-happens-now">updated in August</a> to say he’d moved on to work on another film, for timing reasons.</p>
      <p>There have already been multiple sequels to Paul Verhoeven’s dystopian satire—about an officer who’s killed in the line of duty, then revived by the shady mega-corporation that’s funding the Detroit police department—and not all of them are terrible (though the 2014 reboot starring <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/suicide-squads-joel-kinnaman-will-star-in-netflixs-alte-1776322929">Joel Kinnaman</a> certainly is). <i>RoboCop Returns</i> has long been positioned as a follow-up to the 1987 original, and MGM is sticking with that plan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robocop-returns-lands-little-monsters-director-abe-forsythe-1256699">The Hollywood Reporter</a> broke the Forsythe news, confirming that “the project is being developed as a direct sequel to the original movie released in 1987 by Orion,” and that among its producers will be Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, who co-wrote the 1987 original. The trade also notes that Forsythe will be re-writing the script by Justin Rhodes (who was one of many screenwriters who worked on <i>Dark Fate</i>) and Neumeier and Miner that was originally going to be filmed by Blomkamp.</p>
      <p>There’s no timeline on when <i>RoboCop</i> might be returning to the big screen (or whether there’ll be a role for the fantastic Nyong’o, hint hint), but things appear to be moving full speed ahead for the beloved franchise. And the less we say about <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/what-year-is-it-what-is-happening-1832787187">that recent KFC ad campaign</a>, the better.</p>
