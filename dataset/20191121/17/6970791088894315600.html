      <h1>Kodak Black Files Paperwork To Appeal 46-Month Prison Sentence</h1>

      <p>Florida rapper <b>Kodak Black</b> wants to get out of prison. The hip-hop artist has reportedly filed legal paperwork to appeal last week’s 46-month prison sentence.</p>
      <p>According to reports, <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/kodak-black-appeals-46-month-prison-sentence">Black is determined</a> to have his time reexamined.</p>
      <blockquote>On Wednesday, Kodak’s attorneys filed a notice of appeal for the recently-concluded federal case that ended in the 46-month sentence. It reads: “Notice is hereby given that the Defendant, Bill K. Kapri, takes and enters this, his Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to review the Orders, Judgment and Sentence entered on November 13, 2019.” One of Kodak’s lawyers, Fred Haddad, also ordered a transcript of the November 13 sentencing hearing. (Complex)</blockquote>
      <p>This week, <a href="https://www.sohh.com/kodak-black-might-have-genius-plan-to-leave-prison-early/">reports surfaced about</a> Kodak filing paperwork wanting to enter a rehab program behind bars.</p>
      <blockquote>Completing the 500-hour program could shorten the rapper’s prison sentence by up to a year, but there’s an obstacle standing in his way. The request may get denied if Kodak is charged for a drug-induced fight with a fellow inmate last month. A prison guard tried to break up the melee and Kodak allegedly grabbed his testicles so tightly that he required medical attention. Kodak’s lawyer claims that his client was drugged leading up to the altercation. (VIBE)</blockquote>

      <p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.sohh.com/kodak-black-hit-w-more-charges-now-faces-up-to-30-years-in-prison/">reports surfaced about</a> KB getting hit with more weapons charges.</p>
      <blockquote>Days after Kodak Black was sentenced to 46 months in federal prison, state prosecutors have slapped the rapper with additional weapons charges. The Miami-Dade State Attorney’s office on Friday formally charged the 22-year-old with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He faces up to 30 years in prison on each count as a “habitual violent offender.” (Miami Herald)</blockquote>
