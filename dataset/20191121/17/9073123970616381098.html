        <b>Have you always wanted to win a Fortnite tournament but don’t have the mechanical skills to get it done? The Fortnite Fishing Frenzy contest might be your chance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fishing in Fortnite is something that no one knew they wanted. Fortnite players had a list of requests at the end of Season X. None of them involved the ability to fish, but this addition somehow became one of the best parts of the game.</p>
      <p>Need some health or shields? Want to upgrade your kit? Grab a Harpoon Gun or Fishing Rod and hit the water!</p>

      </ul>
      <p>To compete, all you have to do is enable 2FA, grab a fishing rod, and hit the water. Keep in mind that only fish caught with a fishing rod will count. Harpoon Gun catches won’t qualify you for inclusion.</p>
