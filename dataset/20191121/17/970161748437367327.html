      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pete-davidson/">Pete Davidson</a> has us all shook up with his NSFW Paper magazine cover shoot.</p>
      <p>Posing in the nude, the comedian has been transformed into a Ken doll, and there’s not a plastic penis insight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-pete-davidson-2641400317.html?rebelltitem=21#rebelltitem21">The publication joked with the star about his ‘big d*ck energy’</a> – although there’s very little to see here, and it turns out he thinks the whole concept is weird.</p>
      <p>‘You’re this sexual icon for people,’ they told him before waiting on a response.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old replied: ‘OH!! Well, that’s what people said…’</p>
      <p>Telling Pete how he’s the reason BDE exists, the Saturday Night Live star smirked: ‘I think it’s very… weird. I don’t really pay attention to it.</p>

      <p>‘But I do know that [the gaze] is either, “Ye-YESSS!” or “F**K NO!” There’s no happy medium with me, which I think is really fun.’</p>

      <p>He added: ‘When enough people call you ugly, it definitely gets to you. For me, personally, I can’t block that stuff out.’</p>
      <p>‘That’s why I had to get rid of the internet and stuff. But you definitely have to get to a place where you’re just like, “This is how I look. Alright.” You know?’</p>
      <p>Yet, even though he’s an apparent sex icon, it turns out Pete has his own man crush.</p>

      <p>‘Well, I used to jerk off to Leonardo DiCaprio… Uhh, like his acting,’ he joked: ‘I used to have a HUGE crush on Leonardo DiCaprio. I had this huge poster of him from The Beach in my room, and there used to be, like, “Leo love books”… Do you remember?’</p>
      <p>Last year, Pete deleted his social media accounts after the break down of his engagement to Ariana Grande.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time he has spoken out about his decision to remove himself from the platform as he previously told Variety: ‘Yeah, I can’t go on there for obvious reasons.’</p>
      <p>The funnyman then offered some friendly advice for young fans who may be feeling the pressures of social media.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘Just don’t go online. I don’t think online’s good. It doesn’t make me very happy. If I’m having a good day and I go online, it immediately just [makes me sad].</p>
      <p>‘Even if it’s not about me, it’s random shit like, “Trump farts.” I’m not a fan of it.’</p>
