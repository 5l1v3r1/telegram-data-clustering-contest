      <p>Earlier on Thursday, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent time with winners of the Tusk Conservation Awards.</p>
      <p>A private tea party was held at Kensington Palace where Prince William and Kate Middleton mingled with those to be honoured Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>From the small get together, both William and Kate were expected at the Tusk Conservation Awards gala but the Duchess had to cancel last minute “due to the children.”</p>
      <p>A source tells ET Canada that the Duchess “could not find a babysitter,” but where nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo was is unclear. Kensington Palace would not comment further on the situation.</p>

      <p>While at the gala that was followed by by a reception at the National Portrait Gallery, Prince William, who has been Patron of the Tusk Trust since December 2005, gave a short speech and presented three of the awards.</p>

      <p>“Earlier today, Catherine and I spent some time with the nominees and finalists. Their bravery, single-minded determination, and commitment to African conservation is deeply deeply humbling,” William said.</p>

      <p>“As we approach the start of a new decade, the challenge ahead of us is clear and urgent. Climate change, human population growth, exploitation of natural resources, and habitat loss all pose major threats to the precious balance of our natural world,” he added. “My father has been ringing the alarm bell on these issues for years. He inherited his passion for the environment from my grandfather, and passed it on to the next generation.”</p>
