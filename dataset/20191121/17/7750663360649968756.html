      <h1>How Paris Saint-Germain could line up against Lille</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/psg/"><b>Paris Saint-Germain</b></a> will look to maintain their firm grip on top spot in Ligue 1 when they host <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/lille/"><b>Lille</b></a> at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.</h2>

      <p>A win for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thomas-tuchel/"><b>Thomas Tuchel</b></a>'s side, combined with a defeat for Marseille, would give them an <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/ligue-1/table.html">11 point lead</a> at the top.</p>
      <p>However, they will be conscious of the threat posed by Lille, who <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/lille/result/result-champions-elect-psg-suffer-5-1-humbling-at-lille_356295.html">thrashed the champions 5-1</a> when the two sides last met in April.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how PSG could line up for the meeting with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christophe-galtier/"><b>Christophe Galtier</b></a>'s men.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ander-herrera/"><b>Ander Herrera</b></a> (thigh), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kylian-mbappe/"><b>Kylian Mbappe</b></a> (virus), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/loic-mbe-soh/"><b>Loic Mbe Soh</b></a> (groin), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thilo-kehrer/"><b>Thilo Kehrer</b></a> (foot), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-verratti/"><b>Marco Verratti</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neymar/"><b>Neymar</b></a> (hamstring)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thomas-meunier/"><b>Thomas Meunier</b></a> (hamstring), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/keylor-navas/"><b>Keylor Navas</b></a> (groin)</p>
      <p>Tuchel's selection for this game will be heavily informed by a desire to keep his best players fit for Tuesday's Champions League meeting with Real Madrid at the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>The German has often used <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/colin-dagba/"><b>Colin Dagba</b></a> at right-back in the league this term, and with Meunier still not fully fit, the former will get another chance to impress on Saturday.</p>
      <p>In similar fashion on the other side, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/layvin-kurzawa/"><b>Layvin Kurzawa</b></a> gets the nod as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/juan-bernat/"><b>Juan Bernat</b></a> receives a rest ahead of the game on Tuesday, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/abdou-diallo/"><b>Abdou Diallo</b></a> is slowly presenting a genuine challenge to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/presnel-kimpembe/"><b>Presnel Kimpembe</b></a> at centre-back.</p>
      <p>Tuchel normally opts for a mobile midfield three, but with Verratti and Herrera both injured and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/leandro-paredes/"><b>Leandro Paredes</b></a> lacking full sharpness, it is likely that PSG will play with an extra attacking midfielder.</p>
      <p>The partnership of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marquinhos/"><b>Marquinhos</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/idrissa-gueye/"><b>Idrissa Gueye</b></a> ought to provide sufficient stability at the base of midfield, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/julian-draxler/"><b>Julian Draxler</b></a> plays the role of branching between midfield and attack with his passing.</p>
      <p>Further forward, as always, will be <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/angel-di-maria/"><b>Angel Di Maria</b></a>, whose performances in Ligue 1 so far this term - five goals and five assists - deserves greater recognition.</p>
      <p>On the other side, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pablo-sarabia/"><b>Pablo Sarabia</b></a> will fill in as Neymar, injured since last month, prepares to return in time for the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Fan favourite <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/edinson-cavani/"><b>Edinson Cavani</b></a>, another player to recently recover from injury, is expected to fill in for Mbappe, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauro-icardi/"><b>Mauro Icardi</b></a> looks set to start in the Frenchman's place against Madrid.</p>
