      <p>St. Bonaventure's men's basketball team will wear throwback uniforms honoring the Final Four team from 1970 for Saturday's game against Canisius in KeyBank Center.</p>
      <p>The uniforms were worn during the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>
      <p>St. Bonaventure said it partnered with Adidas to re-create the look of the Final Four team with brown, white and gold.</p>
      <p>Saturday's game is the 168th meeting between Canisius and Bona and the 73rd time the rivalry has taken place in KeyBank Center or the Aud.</p>
      <p>The Bonnies also will wear the throwbacks Dec. 7 against Hofstra for the reunion of the Final Four team at the Reilly Center.</p>
