      <p>The Edmonds Community College volleyball team is seeking another trophy.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Northwest Athletic Conference Volleyball Championship begins Thursday at the Greater Tacoma Convention Center, and the Tritons are one of 16 teams bidding for the tournament’s four trophies. Last year Edmonds took fourth place to claim its first trophy since 2008.</p>
      <p>Edmonds, the No. 2 seed from the North Region, opens the double-elimination tournament against South No. 3 Linn-Benton at 2 p.m. Thursday. Linn-Benton won both times the teams met during the regular season, prevailing 3-2 on Sept. 4 in Albany, Oregon, and 2-0 on Sept. 7 in Bellevue.
