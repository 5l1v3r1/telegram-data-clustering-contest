      <p>Abeiku Santana who was obviously taken aback by her response asked her if she wears panties. Nikki replied saying that she doesn’t wear panties often to allow fresh air pass her private part.</p>
      <p>“I don’t always wear panties because sometimes you have to allow fresh air pass there to make it feel happy”. She reiterated.</p>
