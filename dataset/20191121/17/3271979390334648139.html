      <p><b>Jennifer Aniston</b> and <b>Johnny Depp</b> never dated, nor did the actress ever chase a relationship with the fellow star. One year ago today, however, a tabloid falsely claimed the two had a romance in the works. <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the story at the time and we can confidently confirm our reporting.</p>
      <p>On November 21, 2018, the <b><i>Globe</i></b> published a story with the headline, “Jen’s Crushing On Pirate Johnny.” In the piece, the tabloid alleged <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-johnny-depp-dating/">Aniston wanted to date Depp</a> and was “putting the word out… that she’s be down to have dinner if he’s interested.” The tabloid quoted a very questionable source as saying, “She’s always found him cute. Jen feels Johnny’s had a terrible run of bad luck, and like her he chose his long-term partners extremely badly.” The anonymous insider added that Aniston was attracted to Depp’s “bad-boy image.”</p>
      <p>Like many stories involving Aniston in the tabloids, the entire article is completely bogus. <b>Gossip Cop</b> pointed out at the time that the <i>Friends</i> star was focusing on work and not concerned with dating. Aniston had recently split from Justin Theroux and was in the middle of shooting <i>The Morning Show</i> for Apple TV+. We also checked in with Aniston’s spokesperson, who told us on the record that the story wasn’t true. <b>Gossip Cop</b> didn’t rely on a nameless, faceless “source” like the tabloid. One year later, it shows that our reporting was more accurate.</p>
      <p>It’s hardly surprising that a tabloid would be off in its coverage of the actress. <b>Gossip Cop</b> has debunked numerous stories about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-dating-famous-men-justin-theroux-split/">Aniston dating famous men</a> after breaking up with Theroux. In addition to Depp, Aniston has been falsely linked to John Mayer, Jason Bateman, Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Arnett, and, of course, her most famous ex, Brad Pitt.</p>
      <p>The <i>Globe</i> has come up with some especially egregious examples of bad reporting on Aniston and Pitt. In March, the tabloid blasted the headline “Jen &amp; Brad Elope!” The phony report claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-secretly-eloped-mexico-married/">Aniston and Pitt had secretly gotten married in Mexico</a>. The ridiculous premise was debunked by <b>Gossip Cop</b> after spokespeople for both stars confirmed it was nonsense.</p>
      <p>The tabloid’s track record covering Depp is no better. In fact, <b>Gossip Cop</b> named a previous <i>Globe</i> story the <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/johnny-depp-rumor-2018-dying-secret-health-crisis/">top Johnny Depp rumor of 2018</a>, which was an absurd article about the actor dying from a secret health crisis. Depp clearly wasn’t on death’s door last year. He’s doing just fine. Unfortunately, the magazine hasn’t learned its lesson and recently took another swing at the actor’s health, with a bogus story last week alleging <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/johnny-depp-dead-christmas-health/">Depp will be dead by Christmas</a>. Trusting the <i>Globe</i> and its dubious sources on anything involving Aniston or Depp is a mistake. Stick with <b>Gossip Cop</b> instead.</p>
