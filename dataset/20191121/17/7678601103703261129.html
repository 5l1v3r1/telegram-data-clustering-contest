      <p>Google Assistant can now help you order meals from online food delivery service GoFood on the ride hailing application Gojek.</p>
      <p>It was one of the new features announced at the Google for Indonesia event held in Jakarta on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Google Assistant can also be used for other services on Gojek," said Nimesh Ranjan, Google Assistant Program and NBU lead.</p>
      <p>Previously, the virtual digital assistant could open Gojek but was not able to carry out an order.</p>
      <p>To use the new features, users must press the home button until colorful dots appear on the screen.</p>
      <p>Then they can say, "OK Google, order [food name] on Gojek." They will be directed to the GoFood section of the app and can choose from a selection of restaurants.</p>

      <p>Google Assistant can also help users get a lift from motorcycle taxi service GoRide.</p>
      <p>Additionally, users can use Google Assistant to check their bank balance in BCA accounts.</p>
      <p>Users can say, "OK Google, talk with Bank BCA to check my balance."</p>
      <p>Ranjan said the upgraded Google Assistant allows users to delete their conversation history to enhance safety.</p>
      <p>All the features are available in the Indonesian language. (gis/wng)</p>
