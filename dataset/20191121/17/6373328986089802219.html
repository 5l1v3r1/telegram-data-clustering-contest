      <h1>Russo Brothers Developing Superhero Movie With Keanu Reeves</h1>

        <b><i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>Endgame</i> directors Joe and Anthony Russo are developing another superhero movie – with none other than <i>John Wick</i> himself, Keanu Reeves.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Russo brothers didn’t really take a break after helming the biggest film of all time. Keen to get their production company AGBO off the ground, they’ve attached themselves to a bunch of new, exciting projects.</p>
      <p>However, one that’s got everyone curious is <i>Past Midnight</i>, a Netflix superhero feature set to star Reeves in the lead role. What’s going on with that?</p>

      <p>Regretfully, it’s not even close to production yet. Initially announced a couple of years ago, the pair have (clearly) been too busy to offer much attention to it.</p>
      <p>However, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/61000-russo-brothers-interview-21-bridges-cherry-avengers-endgame"><i>Inverse</i></a>, the blockbuster duo confirmed it’s still being kicked around – it’s just in a ‘formative stage’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joe Russo said: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote><i>Past Midnight</i>’s still in a very formative stage. So it’s probably not best to talk about it yet, but it is a fascinating script.</blockquote>
      <p>One could argue Reeves has played two superheroes already – John Wick is an immensely talented assassin, and <i>The Matrix’</i>s Neo defies all notions of what we know to be possible.</p>

      <p>Marvel Entertainment Chief Creative Officer Kevin Feige confirmed back in June this year <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/marvel-studios-kevin-feige-confirms-keanu-reeves-in-talks-to-join-mcu/">Reeves is considered for everything the MCU puts out</a> – it’s evident that, like the rest of the world, film studios are enamoured with the ‘breathtaking’ actor.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Feige told <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/06/19/marvel-studios-kevin-feige-confirms-conversations-keanu-reeves-mcu/"><i>ComicBook</i></a>: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>We talk to him for almost every film we make. We talk to Keanu Reeves about… I don’t know when, if, or ever he’ll join the MCU, but we very much want to figure out the right way to do it.</blockquote>
      <p>The Russo brothers’ first project in a post-<i>Endgame</i> world, <i>21 Bridges</i> – on which they served as producers, with <i>Black Panther</i> star Chadwick Boseman starring – hits cinemas this Friday, November 22.</p>

      <p>They’re currently filming <i>Cherry</i>, a Tom Holland star vehicle set to be a dark, troubling drama even further outside their superhero pedigree.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The official synopsis reads:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>An Army medic who has returned from Iraq dealing with an opioid addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder begins robbing banks.</blockquote>
      <p>Based on Nico Walker’s <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novel, Anthony Russo said ‘it’s about as gritty as movies get’.</p>

        <b>He added: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>If you read the book, it’s a story about the opioid crisis that involves the Iraq war, PTSD, heroin addiction, Oxycontin addiction, bank robbing. It’s a very intense film and Tom Holland is absolutely bringing it every day.<br/><br/>We’re so impressed with his performance in this movie. It will be a very intense film. It’s also a very artful film, and it’s about a very important subject matter that doesn’t seem to be getting addressed properly: the opioid crisis.</blockquote>
      <p>The siblings’ directorial follow-up has a stacked cast, with <i>It’</i>s Bill Skarsgard, <i>Midsommar’</i>s Jack Reynor, Forrest Goodluck, Ciara Bravo, Jeff Wahlberg, Michael Gandolfini and Kyle Harvey making up the ensemble.</p>
