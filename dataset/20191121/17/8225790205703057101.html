      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - A Hilo man killed during the Korean War has been identified after nearly 70 years.</p>
      <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said Army Cpl. Wilfred K. Hussey Jr. was 19 when he was reported missing in action on Dec. 12, 1950.</p>
      <p>His unit was attacked by enemy forces near Chosin Reservoir in North Korea.</p>
      <p>His remains were returned to Hawaii last year after the summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
      <p>Scientists from the DPAA used DNA, material and circumstantial evidence to identify Hussey.</p>
      <p>Husseyâ€™s name is recorded on the Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, and a rosette will be placed next to his name to show he was accounted for.</p>
      <p>Officials said he will be buried in his hometown of Hilo, but a funeral date has yet to be determined.</p>
