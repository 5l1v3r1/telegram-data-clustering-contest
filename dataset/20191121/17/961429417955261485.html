        <b>Listen to the HSJ Health Check podcast — this week we examine the tentative solution to the NHS pensions crisis, maternity failures in Shropshire, and the mysterious departure of a London finance director.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Each week, HSJ Health Check gathers a cast from our team of expert journalists, to explain and debate the most important news issues right now in NHS policy and leadership.</p>
      <p>You can listen above, follow <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7xRYYFPHmSSrJ1Ggo8GUJ7">us on Spotify</a>, listen on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hsj-health-check/id1484397315?uo=4">Apple Podcasts</a>, or <a href="https://anchor.fm/hsj-health-check">other podcast platforms</a>.</p>
      <p>The latest episode features <i>HSJ</i> deputy editor Dave West, workforce correspondent Annabelle Collins, bureau chief for finance and policy Lawrence Dunhill, and mental health correspondent Rebecca Thomas.</p>
      <p>We discuss: Whatever has happened to the solution, leaked early this week, to the NHS pensions crisis? Would it work? And what are the long-term consequences of doctors having now discovered a work-life balance?</p>
      <p>We also look at the Shrewsbury and Telford maternity care scandal, and the curious departure of an ex-private sector finance director from a long-strained London hospital trust.</p>
      <p>The podcast will be available every Friday morning here and across the major platforms including <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7xRYYFPHmSSrJ1Ggo8GUJ7">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hsj-health-check/id1484397315?uo=4">Apple Podcasts</a>, and <a href="https://anchor.fm/hsj-health-check">others</a>.</p>
