      <h1>Giant marmot that replaced traditional tree as the Christmas display centrepiece divides town</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:10:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Daly , Jessica Carpani</a></address>
      <p>A giant skiing marmot that was unveiled as a town’s Christmas tree replacement has been branded 'ugly' and 'embarrassing' by residents. </p>
      <p>The 16ft, brightly-lit structure, which features hundreds of LED lights was revealed as the centrepiece of the small market town Alton’s Christmas display.</p>
      <p>The Marmot, known as ‘Marmite’ for its ‘love or hate’ reception cost £4,200 and currently dominates the lawn outside the 19th century Assembly Rooms in Alton, Hants, much to the dismay of the residents. </p>
      <p>Until 2017 a traditional tree stood in the prominent spot every Christmas. Last year, it was replaced by a giant lit up Santa’s hat, which was largely well received with people taking selfies with it, according to the council.   </p>
      <p>This year’s unusual choice however, which was in part chosen due to its affordable price, has been criticised for its lack of Christmas relevance. </p>
      <p>The display was decided at a full council meeting with the marmot chosen from three ornaments designed by Blachere Illuminations, beating giant baubles and a polar bear. </p>
      <p>It had been displayed in Camden last year before being bought by the council second-hand, which made the decoration cheaper and within budget.</p>
      <p>Alton Town Council said: “It was really about choosing something that would attract people to the High Street and bring a smile to people’s faces, particularly the children. </p>
      <p>“The marmot was felt to be the most unusual, quirky and was the best value.” </p>
      <p>A town clerk said there was “nothing wrong with the polar bear” but it was “higher cost” and “did not have colour” like the marmot. </p>
      <p>Dozens of people have commented on a Facebook post made by the council introducing the marmot - with mixed reviews. </p>
      <p>Sarah Jones said: "What is this hideous thing and what has it got to do with Christmas?"</p>
      <p>Emma English said: "I just don't understand. Whatever it is, it has no relevance to Christmas, it's embarrassing and just plain ugly.</p>

      <p>"I struggled to like the Christmas hat we had last year but this is another low."</p>
      <p>Others were perplexed by the relevance of the piece.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Frater said: "I don't remember a Marmot being in the Christmas story. But I'm all for something different but relevant to the season."</p>
      <p>Frances Bower added: “A fancy skiing giant rodent. Did the three wise men ride these instead of camels? Or did the shepherds watch their marmot flock by night? However, Caroline Wren said she thought the piece was "fantastic" and that the "children of Alton" will "love" it. </p>
      <p>Resident Colin Hessey also praised the council for "doing something a bit different”.    </p>
      <p>The town’s Christmas decorations were funded by the town council’s yearly £20,000 Yuletide budget, and had been supported by local businesses. </p>
      <p>Town clerk Leah Coney, 42, said: "Christmas is now such a diverse time of year. It's not just about the traditional, now, and everything is pretty secular in its outlook.</p>
      <p>"We used to have a traditional tree outside the Assembly Rooms but some people would say it was boring so we thought we'd do something quirky and hope to attract more people to the town and give the high street a boost.</p>
      <p>"You are never going to please all the people all the time and in many ways we have achieved what we wanted which was to get people talking about Alton."</p>
      <p>Marmot’s are large rodents and do not live in the UK instead preferring mountainous regions such as the Alps and the Rocky Mountains.</p>
      <p>The massive ground dwelling squirrel was put in place on Tuesday November 19 and will remain there until it goes back into storage in January.</p>
