      <p>FASTags, or reloadable tags for payment at toll booths, will be available for free until November 30, Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes a week before FASTags become mandatory at all the booths on national highways from December 1.</p>
      <p>“The FASTags will be available for free until Nov. 30 with a deposit of ₹150,”Mr. Gadkari said at a press conference. From December 1, if anyone comes to a booth without a tag, he or she will have to pay double the toll,” he added.</p>
      <p>The FASTags are affixed to a vehicle’s windscreen and the tax amount is automatically deducted when the vehicle passes through a booth.</p>
      <p>These are available for purchase at all the national highway toll plazas, banks, RTOs and e marketplace, Amazon.</p>
      <p>The tags are being sponsored by the National Highways Authority of India.</p>
      <p>As many as 412 of the 535 national highways have been upgraded with technology to read the tags and allow vehicles to zip through. As of now, 40% of the tax collected is through FASTags.</p>
