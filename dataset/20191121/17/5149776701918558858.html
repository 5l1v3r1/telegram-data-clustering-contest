      <h1>Former cake company manager gambled away £370,000 of defrauded cash</h1>
      <h2>The dad of two bet ever larger amounts</h2>

      <p>A former manager was jailed for three years after cheating a cake company out of £370,347 - then gambling it all away.</p>
      <p>Father-of-two Benjamin Jones, 30, kept it up for three years as he bet ever larger amounts, Nottingham Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>That has left his former employers the Cake Decorating Company, Colwick, seeking civil action to claw back some of the cash from bookies Betway.</p>
      <p>Katrina Wilson, prosecuting, told the court: "There are offers of assistance from the defendant because Betway was not checking the authenticity of the money being used by this defendant.</p>
      <p>"The company are seeking advice on whether it is possible to be reimbursed through these channels."</p>
      <p>Miss Wilson said: "The fraud started low, £5,000 a month. At later stages, he was stealing up to £30,000 a month."</p>
      <p>He did it by taking orders and getting customers to pay into his Paypal account, then altering company computer records to cover it up.</p>
      <p>Judge Simon Hirst said it caused great concern to cake company chief Daniel White who could not discover the source of the losses.</p>
      <p>"He took out a series of loans to keep the company afloat. If he had not done so, no doubt the company would have had to go into administration and employees would have lost their jobs," the judge said.</p>
      <p>He said that because of the "parlous state" of the company it could not borrow from major lenders. That meant it was forced to take out high interest loans which currently add up to monthly repayments of £14,000.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">judge</a> told Jones of Hotspur Drive, Colwick: "I note during your offending, you attended Gamblers' Anonymous but didn't like them and chose to stop attending.</p>
      <p>"Had you not left and been successful, the loss to the company would have been much less." Jones will have to serve 18 months in custody before being freed and put on probation.</p>
      <p>He admitted fraud from May 2015 to November 30 last year. He was wholesale manager at the company and matters came to light when his work suffered and he used a gambling website at the office.</p>
      <p>Omran Belhadi, mitigating, said that Jones had repaid £4,500 and is addicted to gambling.</p>
      <p>He urged the judge to delay sentencing Jones for six months. He said this would enable Jones to help other people with the problem - as well as helping betting companies combat it.</p>
      <p>A psychiatrist had analysed Jones' addiction and said it could be linked to the childhood death of his brother.</p>
      <p>Mr Belhadi said: "His medical condition goes to reducing his culpability significantly."</p>
      <p>He is regularly seeing a counsellor as well as taking part in twice-weekly sessions on Skype with a US expert in tacking the addiction, added Mr Belhadi.</p>
      <p>Jones had never been in trouble before.</p>
      <p>After the case, a family member said: "I don't want to talk to you. Leave us alone. Show some respect."</p>
      <p>Company owner Daniel White confirmed later that action is underway and said: "Benjamin betrayed our trust and we were badly let down by the gambling companies involved.</p>
      <p>"The effect on our company was substantial but minimised due to the theft occurring over a number of years. The calculated and sophisticated theft affected our growth at the time but we've recovered well. Less robust companies would likely not have been able to weather the storm.</p>
      <p>"Gambling companies have a regulatory duty to prevent stolen money from being gambled. Adequate money laundering checks were not carried out which left us vulnerable to this crime.</p>
      <p>"The Gambling Commission are carrying out their own independent investigation and we hope to hear from them shortly."</p>
