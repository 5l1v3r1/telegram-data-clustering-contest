        <li>“They all want her to meet the Queen and honestly it is her dream to meet her,” she added.</li>

      <p>Some royal fans show their love for the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/royal-insider">British monarchy</a> by collecting memorabilia, while others enjoy <a href="https://www.insider.com/fashion-blogger-sharon-joan-recreates-meghan-markle-wardrobe-ebay-2019-5">replicating their most iconic outfits</a> from over the years.</p>
      <p>Most of those people aren’t 8-year-old schoolgirls from Alabama, though.</p>
      <p>Anna Claire Cantrell hasn’t let her age stop her from learning everything there is to know about the British royal family, or from educating her classmates on every royal throughout history, from William the Conqueror to Meghan Markle.</p>
      <p>But the best way she pays tribute to the most famous family in the world? By dressing like our current monarch, <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/queen-elizabeth-ii">Queen Elizabeth II.</a></p>

      <p>Anna Claire’s love for the royals started when she was just 5 years old from watching TV shows, movies, and documentaries about the royal family with her mom, Andrea.</p>
      <p>“Since then she has watched everything and read everything about the royal family,” Andrea told Insider. “She wanted to learn about every one of them from William the Conqueror, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Mary I, Victoria, George, and of course Elizabeth II.</p>
      <p>“She has even worked on speaking in a British accent. She loves to educate people on the royal family so her teacher let her bring her British books to school and teach her third grade class about [them].”</p>

      <p>Andrea added that last month her daughter went to the Birmingham British Bash in Birmingham, Alabama “to taste all the British food and participate in the costume contest.”</p>
      <p>“She loved all of the British-themed food such as shepherd’s pie and scones,” she said. “Her favorite part was that she won best dressed for her Queen Elizabeth II costume.”</p>

      <p>Her love for the Queen also sparked her love of corgis.</p>
      <p>“We now have two of our own royal corgis,” Andrea said.</p>
      <p>The family’s furry companions, Madie Elizabeth and Winston, were named after Queen Elizabeth and Winston Churchill, Andrea told Insider.</p>

      <h3>Anna Claire has big ambitions, just like Her Majesty</h3>
      <p>Despite being just 8 years old, Anna Claire already has big plans for her future. When she grows up, she hopes to be either the United States ambassador to the UK, or the Secretary of State, according to her mom.</p>
      <p>But as of right now, her biggest goal is to meet the royal family – and she’s already halfway there.</p>
      <p>“Everyone in our town and surrounding towns knows how much Anna Claire loves the royal family and always sends her stuff when they find it,” she added. “They all want her to meet the Queen and honestly it is her dream to meet her.”</p>

      <p>“About a year and a half ago she decided to write [to] the Queen and was thrilled that she got a reply back,” Andrea told Insider.</p>
      <p>“This summer she decided to write the Queen, Prince Phillip, Prince Charles, William and Kate, and Harry and Meghan.</p>
      <p>“She actually got a reply back from every one of them.”</p>
