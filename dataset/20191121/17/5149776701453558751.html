      <h1>Who is Tala Gouveia? Meet the Nottingham actress playing DCI McDonald in new ITV cop drama Invisible</h1>
      <h2>When I moved to London everyone was like 'it's ba'R'th not bath'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:17:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:17</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>She grew up running around backstage at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-playhouse">Nottingham Playhouse</a> and gone on to feature in ITV smash hit Cold Feet and CBeebies' Go Jetters.</p>
      <p>Now rising star Tala Gouveia is taking on her first major TV role starring in new <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/itv">ITV</a> cop drama Invisible alongside telly stalwart Jason Watkins (The Crown, The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies, W1A), plus Ilkeston's stage and screen legend Robert Lindsay, Basford's Corrie actress <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/natalie-fled-coronation-street-again-2966176">Cassie Bradley </a>and Woodthorpe's West End star <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/music-nightlife/meet-nottinghams-west-end-star-2506959">Rosalie Craig</a>.</p>
      <p>Filmed in Bath over the summer, the two 120-minute specials follow the unlikely partnered coppers, played by Tala and Watkins as they solve a pair of murders.</p>
      <p>Carrington-born Tala (who plays ballsy DCI McDonald in the show) gives NottinghamshireLive the low-down...</p>
      <h3>You grew up in Carrington and stayed in Nottingham until you were eighteen, what happened after that?</h3>
      <p>I went to London after I left Nottingham and it was a bit of a difference. People have misconceptions of London and Nottingham, it goes both ways.</p>
      <p>I moved and people went "erm, it's ba'R'th not bath" and then I'll come back to Nottingham and everyone is like "erm, where's the 'r' in bath". I just mix it up now.</p>
      <h3>How did you get into acting and have you ever wanted to do anything else?</h3>
      <p>My parents were both in theatre and educational theatre, so I grew up sort of running around Nottingham Playhouse and the Roundabout Theatre Company.</p>
      <p>I was just brought up by a bunch of actors really.</p>
      <p>I think I understood from an early age that you could have political points in stories and talk about society using a fairy tale. Theatre can be fun but I also think it's a really important way to open conversations about change.</p>
      <p>I thought at one point I'd get a proper job and become a lawyer, but I was only 11.</p>

      <h3>Tell us about your character DCI McDonald in Invisible</h3>
      <p>She's working for the Met police in London and is in line for a promotion but can only do make that jump if she goes to work with police in Bath.</p>
      <p>It's a city which feels much smaller to her - she finds it a bit sleepy and a bit slow. She is partnered with this older guy [Jason Watkins as the shy and retiring DS Dodds] who has always lived there. He's been at his desk for years but he's been randomly placed back out in the field.</p>
      <p>He's so slow and methodical and works completely different to my character who thinks it's going to be a nightmare but they end up forming this really unlikely partnership. And it works because they are so opposite.</p>
      <p>DCI McDonald is very assertive and makes decisions very quickly (sometimes they're right, sometimes not so right). He'll cling to very small details that end up being massive things in the case. So they really compliment each other.</p>
      <h3>Is DC McDonald anything like yourself?</h3>
      <p>I'm quite impatient and she does a lot of eye-rolling which I didn't have to dig too deep to do. I hope I'm a bit more diplomatic than her though.</p>
      <h3>There are quite a few local actors appearing in the show isn't there?</h3>
      <p>We've got loads. We've got Robert Lindsay, Cassie Bradley (who I worked with at the National Theatre on Husbands and Sons, that was actually set in Nottingham), Rosalie Craig (who does a lot of theatre) and there might even be another one. But yeah, the first episode has a big percentage of Nottingham actors, so everyone is going to have to tune in and watch.</p>
      <h3>How did you find filming in Bath?</h3>
      <p>Bath is so beautiful, there were so many amazing houses. We were filming in the Bath Guildhall, the central library, the abbey, a beautiful big mansion called Crowe Hall... we were really spoilt for gorgeous settings.</p>
      <h3>How will you be watching the show when it airs?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes I have to watch by myself and then watch it again but as it is two hours long I think I will have to watch it first with my family. My friends will want a big party but I'll probably watch it with my mum and maybe my grandad.</p>
      <p>I hope everyone loves it. I hope the audience roots for our characters and I hope there are things people can identify with.</p>
