      <p>A shallow 6.1-magnitude earthquake hit northwestern Laos near the <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/pope-francis-arrives-in-thailand-at-start-of-asia-trip-263302">Thai border early Thursday</a>, the United States Geological Survey reported, alarming locals who felt buildings shake as far away as Bangkok.</p>
      <p>There were no immediate reports of damage after the quake hit at 6:50 am.</p>
      <p>But tremors could be felt more than 700 kilometres away in the Thai capital, where Pope Francis is currently on a four-day visit. </p>
      <p>"The shaking... was the main shock from a quake in Laos at 6:50 am and was felt in northern and northeastern Thailand and Bangkok and suburbs," said Sophon Chaila, an official at the Thai Meteorological Department.</p>
      <p>"As of now there is no report of damage," Sophon said.</p>
      <p>The department said the quake-affected nine provinces in Thailand and there were four lesser aftershocks. It also became a top trending topic on Twitter in Thailand.</p>
      <p>Residents in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi also felt buildings sway. </p>
      <p>"The ceiling lights were shaking quite strongly. I felt dizzy and scared," said Hanoi resident Tran Hoa Phuong, who felt the earthquake in her 27-storey apartment building. </p>
      <p>It hit about three hours after a 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck the same region of Laos, near the site of the large Xayaburi dam project, which reported no damage so far. </p>
      <p>Information is slow to trickle out of the closed communist state, and there were similarly no official reports of damage or injuries after the twin quakes hit early Thursday.</p>
      <p>Impoverished Laos has ploughed ahead with ambitious dam-building projects that critics say lack transparency and stringent safety measures.</p>
      <p>The cost was laid bare last year when a massive hydropower project collapsed in southern Laos, killing dozens and leaving thousands homeless.</p>
      <p>Pope Francis arrived in <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/seven-suspects-arrested-for-rebel-attacks-in-thailands-south-260958">Bangkok</a> on Wednesday and has a busy agenda Thursday meeting officials and the Thai king before he leads a mass in the evening. </p>
      <p>There was no word from his team on whether he felt the quake. </p>
      <p>Powerful earthquakes occasionally strike hard in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>In 2016 a 6.8-magnitude quake struck Myanmar, killing at least three people and damaging temples in the ancient temple town of Bagan. </p>
