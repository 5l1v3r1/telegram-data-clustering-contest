        <b>Zinedine Zidane faces another crossroads in his handling of Gareth Bale, who appeared to mock Real Madrid after Wales' 2-0 victory over Hungary yesterday morning (Singapore time).</b>
      </p>
      <p>After sealing qualification for Euro 2020 with a wild win in Cardiff, an ecstatic Bale celebrated next to his teammates behind a flag that read "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order".</p>
      <p>The flag was taken from the crowd after Welsh fans made a slogan out of comments made by former Real star and director of football Predrag Mijatovic during an interview with Spanish radio station Cadena Ser last month.</p>
      <p>"Bale thinks first about the Wales national team, then about golf and then about Madrid," said Mijatovic.</p>
      <p>"I haven't talked to him, but that is the impression I get."</p>
      <p>Zidane must now decide whether to punish Bale and what form that punishment should take.</p>
      <p>Bale's Wales boss, however, was in a distinctly happier mood.</p>
      <p>Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs hailed Wales' qualification for Euro 2020 as one of the best days of his life after Aaron Ramsey's double saw off Hungary in a winner-takes-all clash in Group E.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't get any better," said Giggs, who won 25 major trophies as a United player.</p>
      <p>"It's one of the best days of my life."</p>
      <p>This is only the second time Wales have qualified for the European Championship. - AFP</p>
