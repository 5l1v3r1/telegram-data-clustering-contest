      <p>Tonight's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> saw several <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/raw">RAW</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/smackdown">SmackDown Live</a> Superstars invading the show, mere days before the upcoming Survivor Series PPV, where all the three brands will collide in a series of Triple Threat matches.</p>
      <p>RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch competed against Rhea Ripley in a match that ended in a No Contest after interference by Shayna Baszler and others. NXT Tag Team Champions Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly defeated SmackDown Live's The Revival. The episode came to an end with a full-fledged brawl involving Superstars from all three brands. The Full Sail audience greeted Seth Rollins with a "Seth's not cool!" chant. The brawl continued as the show went off-air.</p>
