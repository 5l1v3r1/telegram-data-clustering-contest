      <p>A total of £4,018,101.82 was spent on agency staff by schools in the borough between September last year and August this year.</p>
      <p>For the start of the 2019/20 academic year, in September alone schools in the Dudley borough spent £205,982 on agency staff.</p>
      <p>And 51 schools have paid to use agency staff between September last year and August this year, the figures released under a Freedom of Information request have revealed.</p>
      <p>The figures include primary schools, secondary schools and nurseries. The overall figure also incorporated special schools and referral units.</p>
      <p>The school which spent the most in the 12 months between September last year and August this year was Pens Meadow School, which spent more than £319,000.</p>
      <p>Pens Meadow is a special school and offers places for 65 pupils aged between three to 16 years at a site in Stourbridge and Pensnett.</p>
      <p>Special school Old Park, in Brierley Hill, spent the second highest sum – £277,633 – while Halesbury, in Feldon Lane, Halesowen, spent £251,206.</p>
      <p>Queen Victoria Primary School, in Dudley, and Summerhill Secondary School, in Kingswinford, spent £194,409 and £167,825 respectively.</p>
      <p>Schools in Dudley control their own budgets and decide when agency staff need to be brought in.</p>
      <p>Other big spenders in the borough included St Mark's Primary School in Brierley Hill, which spent £143,051 in September 2018 to August 2019, and Dormston Secondary School in Sedgley, which spent £124,159 on agency staff.</p>
      <p>Schools across Dudley spent £2.14m on agency staff in six months between September 2014 and February 2015, and figures covering the period from September 2013 to April 2014, showed that £2.8m was spent on agency staff.</p>
      <p>Coseley Councillor Sue Ridney, who is Dudley Council's shadow cabinet member for children and young people, said schools bring in agency staff "reluctantly"</p>
      <p>She said: "I am a chair of a school in my own ward and we set our budgets to try to cover so we don't have to use agency staff.</p>
      <p>"Although we have employed part-time staff to cover part of the curriculum, obviously when staff are on maternity leave or long-term sick sometimes we do have to cover the absences with agency staff.</p>
      <p>"That will be repeated in many schools.</p>
      <p>"Some teachers find it hard with what goes in schools and some do go off on long-term sick and we need to cover that. Particularly with primary schools, teachers need to be in the classroom.</p>
      <p>"Spending on agency staff is done reluctantly in schools. Children build up a rapport with their teachers and strangers coming in can be quite distressing and makes it difficult for them to learn.</p>
      <p>"It is something we have to accept. It is important that children don't miss lessons due to teachers being off.</p>
      <p>"The cost for agency staff comes out the budget and budgets can be quite tight – most run on fresh air."</p>
