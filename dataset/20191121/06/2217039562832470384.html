        <b>New Zealander Dave Rennie was tasked yesterday with resurrecting the Wallabies, replacing Michael Cheika as head coach in a deal that will take him through to the 2023 Rugby World Cup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rennie, who turns 56 tomorrow, becomes only the second non-Australian to lead the team and will fulfil his coaching commitments to Scottish side Glasgow Warriors, before assuming his new role in July next year.</p>
      <p>"This is a massive coup for Australian rugby. Dave was the clear standout candidate for the job, and we're thrilled to have secured his services," Rugby Australia chief Raelene Castle said. - AFP</p>
