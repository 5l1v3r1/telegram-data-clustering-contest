      <p>Melbourne nightclub <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/club.aspx?id=137751">XE54</a> will close down early in 2020. <br/><br/>Michael Christidis, director of <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/promoter.aspx?id=75193">Untitled Group</a>, the local outfit that manages the venue, told <i>Resident Advisor</i>, "When the XE54 site became available, we knew it was the perfect site, although it was always understood XE54 would be a short-term project. While we would've hoped for more time, we are extremely happy and proud of what we've achieved in our two years at the space." <br/><br/>He added that the building will continue operating as a venue, however "it won't have any of the features of XE54 as we know it and it won't be suited to host XE54's artists or audience." <br/><br/>Since it opened in 2017, the four-room Southbank club has hosted house and techno heads like Honey Dijon, Carl Craig, Marcel Dettmann, Dana Ruh and DJ Koze. A closing party will be held on January 18th with lineup and details TBA. Until then, <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/saoirse">Saoirse</a> and Motorik Vibe Council are among the upcoming bookings. <br/><br/>For more on the state of the local club scene, watch our latest <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3545">Real Scenes film</a>.</p>
