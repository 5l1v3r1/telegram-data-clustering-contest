      <h1>Sarkodie personally paid for my expensive ‘Hye Me Bo’ music video – Akwaboah</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:44:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>Ghanaian Highlife singer Gladstorm Kwabena Akwaboah Jnr has revealed that Sarkodie personally paid for his expensive ‘Hye Me Bo’ video.</p>
      <p>Akwaboah was in the studios of YFM to promote his newly released song ‘Gansta Lovin’ and answered some question concerning his supposed exit from Sarkodie’s record label and music in general.</p>
      <p>It was there he revealed that the affiliation with Sarkodie has helped people to recognise him as a good singer as well since people only knew him to be a songwriter.</p>
      <p>According to Akwaboah, though <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/akwaboah-reportedly-leaves-sarkcess-music-signs-a-new-deal-with-a-multi-million-record-label/">there have been rumours about him leaving SarkCess Music</a>, the pair are on very good terms adding that he can never be ungrateful to Sarkodie because there’s a lot he has done for him in terms of music.</p>
      <p>he revealed that after releasing ‘Hye Me Bo’, good video directors, an expensive location was needed for the video shoot and in all, Sarkodie took it upon himself to finance the whole video shoot.</p>
