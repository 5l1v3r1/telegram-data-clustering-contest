        <b>Germany may be the joint-most successful team in European Championship history, but Die Mannschaft legend Lothar Matthaeus believes arch-rivals England are better placed to win Euro 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>His comments come as Germany coach Joachim Loew opined that six teams - England, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Holland - are better prepared for success at European football's showpiece tournament next June.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old, who was in Indonesia as an ambassador for the Bundesliga, told The New Paper via a phone interview last weekend: "We've refreshed the team very well. We've got good talented players, but I hope they are ready next year.</p>
      <p>"Germany are always one of the favourites, but I don't think they are No. 1 at this moment.</p>
      <p>"The French are a little bit better. The English are a little bit better. The Spanish and Italians are on the same level as Germany.</p>
      <p>"But it is a tough competition. For a team to win the European Championship, they would have to play five or six wonderful games."</p>
      <p>Matthaeus should know, having been a part of Germany's European Championship-winning team in 1980. He also lifted the World Cup 10 years later.</p>
      <p>The man whose name is synonymous with the libero position also enjoys legendary status at Bayern Munich, where he won seven Bundesliga crowns over two spells.</p>
      <p>Matthaeus believes Ajax Amsterdam coach Erik ten Hag is the right man to assume the hot seat at his former club, but has backed Hansi Flick in the interim.</p>
      <p>Bayern, who have won the last seven Bundesliga titles, dispensed with Niko Kovac this month after a 5-1 thrashing by Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <h3>BAYERN BACK FLICK</h3>
      <p>They replaced him with Flick, Loew's former assistant, who oversaw a 4-0 hammering of last year's runners-up Borussia Dortmund in just his second match in charge.</p>
      <p>Bayern said that the 54-year-old would continue as the club's interim head coach "at least until Christmas, or maybe even beyond".</p>
      <p>Matthaeus backed the appointment of his former Bayern teammate in the meantime, but said that the German giants should eventually move for ten Hag.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman coached Bayern's second team from 2013-2015, before leading Ajax to the Champions League semi-finals last season. Only a 96th-minute goal and the away-goals rule saw them miss out on the final.</p>
      <p>Ten Hag, 49, has since said that Bayern are "still in my heart", but insists he will end the season in Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>Matthaeus sees no problem with that, saying that in the short term, Flick can win back a dressing room that reportedly had abandoned Kovac during his final days.</p>
      <p>"We have now a very good coach at Bayern, he's not too famous, but he's done a very good job," he said.</p>
      <p>"I know him from 30 years ago when we played together at Bayern, he was assistant to Jogi Loew when Germany won the World Cup in Brazil in 2014.</p>
      <h3>RESPECT</h3>
      <p>"He knows all the players. He is somebody who can talk nicely with players, he knows what he wants and players follow him.</p>
      <p>"This is the most important thing. The players have to respect the coach and the club have to be behind the coach 100 per cent.</p>
      <p>"It's the safer option for Hansi Flick to stay for one or two more years. In the future, when Bayern would like to have a (new) coach, then ten Hag can be the right man for Bayern.</p>
      <p>"He speaks German, he had two years in Bayern's youth team. He plays a fantastic style of football with Ajax getting good results."</p>
