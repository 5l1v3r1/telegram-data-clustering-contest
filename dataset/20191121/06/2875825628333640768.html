      <h1>Jose Mourinho's appointment could be blessing in disguise for Troy Parrott</h1>
      <h2>It certainly doesn’t have to be the nightmare scenario that some were depicting yesterday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho's appointment at Tottenham could be a blessing in disguise for Ireland starlet Troy Parrott.</p>
      <p>It certainly doesn’t have to be the nightmare scenario that some were depicting yesterday.</p>
      <p>Cracking the Spurs first team-squad is all well and good, but unless he is getting game-time, the Ireland newcomer would be as well off on loan.</p>
      <p>It is no secret that Mourinho has a peculiar attitude towards promoting young players. It would appear that he just doesn’t trust them.</p>
      <p>Christian Pulisic - according to one of his old coaches - snubbed Manchester United for that reason and later signed for Chelsea where he is now thriving.</p>
      <p>At United, the likes of Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial seemed to be in a permanent state of flux under the Portuguese.</p>
      <p>His reputation is one of splashing the cash on established players who can make immediate impacts, rather than putting time into shaping what is already available.</p>
      <p>The initial suggestion is that Mourinho does not feel the need to spend heavily in January, but we’ll see.</p>
      <p>If that transpires, Parrott , 17, could yet have a role to play having already become a regular around the first-team squad after prolific goal scoring at underage level.</p>
      <p>But if Mourinho says that Parrott - reportedly on Bayern Munich’s radar - is not in his plans, a loan move beckons.</p>

      <p>For Ireland, the value of such an experience would be enormous heading into the Euro 2020 playoff in Slovakia.</p>
      <p>As Robbie Keane, the Ireland assistant manager and former Tottenham striker, said this summer: “Harry Kane went to four teams on loan.”</p>
      <p>Keane was answering a question in June as to whether Parrott would benefit from some time away from White Hart Lane.</p>
      <p>And his advice?</p>
      <p>“Go and play because you get so much experience being in front of a crowd instead of 25 people,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That feeling of the crowd shouting, whether it’s 5,000 people or 10,000 - it’s pressure.. Is there pressure playing Under-23s, when nobody is watching you?.”</p>
      <p>Keane continued: “It’s all about playing for young players, it doesn’t matter where you are.</p>
      <p>“As long as you’re playing every week in the Championship, League One, wherever it may be, just go and play.”</p>

      <p>But a penny for Parrott’s thoughts on Tuesday night as he checked his phone in the dressing room after scoring in the Irish Under-21’s rout of Sweden.</p>
      <p>The axe fell on his old gaffer just before kick-off and it wasn’t a shock to see him kept away from any media duties afterwards.</p>
      <p>Parrot owes Mauricio Pochettino everything. The Argentine blooded him in pre-season and then handed him a debut in the League Cup eight weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He was then on the bench away to Everton the day Andre Gomes suffered a horror ankle injury. Harry Kane missed that game due to illness and Parrott was the fallback.</p>
      <p>That’s how highly they rate him. But not even Parrott himself has a handle yet on what Mourinho makes of him.</p>
      <p>But as England captain Kane discovered at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester, a taste of regular first-team football elsewhere can be the making of you.</p>
      <p>And that wasn’t lost on Ireland boss Mick McCarthy who, after Monday’s draw with Denmark, was already turning his sights to the playoff in March.</p>
      <p>McCarthy said of Parrott: “Let’s hope he plays somewhere and gets some football, and then we would have another (striker playing regularly).”</p>
