      <p>As trade talks between China and the US continued to threaten world markets, US President said on Wednesday that <a href="https://www.wionews.com/business-economy/donald-trump-says-us-is-still-talking-to-china-on-trade-263477">China wasn't "stepping up"</a> to the level he wanted.</p>
      <p>"I can tell you this. China would much rather make a trade deal than I would," Trump told reporters, adding, "I don't think they're stepping up to the level that I want."</p>
      <p>Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday as hopes faded of phase one deal with China. On the second straight day of losses, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and broader S&amp;P 500 both fell 0.4 per cent to end the day at 27,821.09 and 3,108.37, respectively.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq fell 0.5 per cent, to close at 8,526.73.</p>
      <p>Trump's comments came amid a looming deadline with the US set to add tariffs on another $160 billion in Chinese goods next month.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Tokyo stocks opened lower over concerns of China-US trade talks. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.24 per cent or 55.70 points at 23,092.87 in early trade.</p>
      <p>The US president who visited the Apple factory with CEO Tim Cook said he was considering whether to exempt Apple from tariffs on imports from China.</p>
      <p>"The problem we have is you have Samsung. It's a great company but it's a competitor of Apple, and it's not fair if, because we have a trade deal with Korea - we made a great trade deal with South Korea - but we have to treat Apple on a somewhat similar basis as we treat Samsung," Trump said. <br/> </p>
