      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 21): theedgemarkets.com has highlighted twelve stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. All twelve stocks displayed negative momentum.</p>
      <p>The stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>Alam Maritim Resources Bhd — up 1.5 sen to 14.5 sen</p>
      <p>BSL Corp Bhd — up 2.5 sen to 36.5 sen</p>
      <p>Fintec Global Bhd — unchanged at 8 sen</p>
      <p>KESM Industries Bhd — up 19 sen to RM8.58</p>
      <p>MClean Technologies Bhd — up 2.5 sen to 24.5 sen</p>
      <p>MHC Plantations Bhd — unchanged at 60 sen</p>
      <p>Rohas Tecnic Bhd — up 0.5 sen to 76 sen</p>
      <p>Sanichi Technology Bhd — unchanged at 5 sen</p>

      <p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendations. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
