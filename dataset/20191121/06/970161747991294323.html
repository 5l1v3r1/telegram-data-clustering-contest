      <p>England batted themselves into a promising position on day one of the first Test against New Zealand in Tauranga.</p>
      <p>In Chris Silverwood’s first match as head coach, Joe Denly, Ben Stokes and Rory Burns all scored fifties as England reached 241-4 at the close of play.</p>
      <p>The newly-formed opening partnership of Burns and debutant Dom Sibley set the platform and, despite a failure from captain <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-root/">Joe Root</a>, England’s middle order capitalised to frustrate New Zealand.</p>

      <p>The Bay Oval Test against New Zealand represents England’s first red-ball match since the home Ashes last summer.</p>
      <p>After Root won the toss and elected to bat first, the fledging Burns and Sibley opening partnership was immediately put under the microscope and the early signs were promising.</p>
      <p>Sibley, representing his country for the first time, clipped his first delivery to the mid-wicket boundary, before producing a number of other impressive shots in a 52-run opening stand with the assured Burns.</p>

      <p>Warwickshire’s Sibley was unable to take advantage of his start, however, falling for 22 as he tried to work Colin de Grandhomme through the leg-side but only managed to edge to slip.</p>
      <p>That turned out to be New Zealand’s sole success for the first half of the day, with Burns and Denly both impressing as they took England past 100.</p>
      <p>Given the magnitude of the series and the level of opposition, Burns enjoyed a fine Ashes series and looked in good touch again today, reaching his fifth Test fifty today before feathering a thin edge off De Grandhomme.</p>

      <p>That dismissal led to New Zealand’s most dominant spell of the day, as Root – usually so steady and proactive – took 21 balls to get off the mark.</p>
      <p>He perished to his next delivery from Neil Wagner, guiding a simple catch to Tim Southee at second slip.</p>
      <p>Denly and Stokes wrestled the momentum back from New Zealand, however, with the former passing fifty for the fourth time in his last seven England innings.</p>

      <p>Kent batsman Denly once again fell short of a maiden Test century – edging a fine Southee delivery through to wicketkeeper BJ Watling for 74 – but left the crease with England on top.</p>

      <p>And the tourists finished the day with a flourish, scoring 38 runs in the final eight overs against a tiring Kiwi attack.</p>
      <p>World Cup hero Stokes hit Trent Boult for 16 in the same over he was dropped by Ross Taylor in the slips, and Ollie Pope finished the day on 18 from 23 balls.</p>

      <p>Speaking at the close of play, England opener Burns said: ‘It was a tough but good day.</p>
      <p>‘The wicket was a bit slower than we were expecting and that made the cricket quite attritional.</p>
      <p>‘Me and Sibley are going to be a bit more traditional at the top of the innings. It didn’t really feel different for me personally – I always go about my batting that way, see off the good balls, pick off the bad ones.</p>
      <p>‘I was nowhere near my fluent best but managed to stick in and grit it out. I’m disappointed to only get a 50 and not a big one.’</p>
      <p>New Zealand bowler Wagner, meanwhile, added: ‘The bowlers stuck to it pretty well, we kept charging in but England batted really well.</p>
      <p>‘But they haven’t run away from us and if we get a couple of early wickets tomorrow we’re right back in it.’</p>
