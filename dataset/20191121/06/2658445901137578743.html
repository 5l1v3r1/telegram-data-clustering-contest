      <h3>Mike Odiegwu, Yenagoa</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Family of late former Bayelsa State Governor, Chief Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, yesterday said it worked assiduously with other stakeholders to end the reign of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state because incumbent Governor Seriake Dickson disappointed the people.</p>
      <p>Speaking under the auspices of Alamcoism Movement (AM), the former governor’s family said Dickson insulted the late Alamieyeseigha and disrespected Ijaw elders in most of his dealings and utterances.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Yenagoa, the Director-General, Alamcoism Movement, Ziriworiten Alamieyeseigha, who said the movement started in 1999, lamented that the PDP abandoned the template of development and empowerment laid down by the late governor.</p>
      <p>“The PDP government disappointed Alamieyeseigha’s family. Alamcoism endorsed Seriake Dickson but at the end of the day what did he do? He disappointed the family, insulted Alamcoism. So, we decided that since he failed to respect elders, we should teach him a lesson,” he said.</p>
      <p>Alamieyeseigha, who was flanked by principal members of the movement such as the Student Representative, Oyeindoubra Amantari and Director of Planning/Strategy, Abosi Felagha, warned Lyon against breaking his social contract with the people.</p>
      <p>He advised Lyon to learn from the past governments, desist from listening to rumours and to focus on human capital development to address the endemic poverty in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>Alamieyeseigha appealed to the governor-elect to pay attention to the infrastructural development of the state, especially the construction of a seaport in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>He also called on Dickson and the PDP to shelve the idea of going to court to challenge the victory of Lyon, saying instead of wasting state’s money on litigation, they should channel the resources to infrastructural development.</p>
