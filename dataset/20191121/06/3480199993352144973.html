      <p>Sophie Ashton, 23, was spotted by police at 2am on October 12 as she drove her car towards them with no lights on, in Dawley Green Way in Telford.</p>
      <p>The officers stopped her and found her to be twice over the drink driving limit, Telford magistrates were told.</p>
      <p>Ashton, of Clock Tower Avenue, Wrockwardine Wood, pleaded guilty to driving while over the alcohol limit.</p>
      <p>Representing Ashton, Shakeel Ahmed told the court: "Friends visited her at her home address, and she offered to give her friends a lift home."</p>
      <p>Mr Ahmed said Ashton had recently lost her mother and her friends were consoling her.</p>
      <p>He told the court that the obligatory driving ban would have a "devastating" impact on her life, as she has three children who attend two different schools several miles apart.</p>
      <p>Ashton also attends college and volunteers for St John's Ambulance.</p>
      <p>Magistrates banned her from driving for 12 months and fined her Â£120.</p>
      <p>Chair of the bench Angela Channon said they took into account her "evident remorse".</p>
