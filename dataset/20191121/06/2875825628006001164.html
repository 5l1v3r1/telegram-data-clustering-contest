      <h1>Padraic Joyce will bring attractive style of football as Galway boss says Kieran Fitzgerald</h1>
      <h2>The two men played alongside each other when Galway won their last All-Ireland in 2001</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/pat-nolan/" target="_blank">Pat Nolan</a></address>
      <p>Padraic Joyce will bring an attractive style of football as the new Galway manager, says his former teammate Kieran Fitzgerald.</p>
      <p>The two men played alongside each other when Galway won their last All-Ireland in 2001 but it has been pretty barren for them since, with last year’s All-Ireland semi-final appearance their first at that stage in 17 years.</p>
      <p>Another ex-teammate, Kevin Walsh, oversaw an upturn in the team’s fortunes in recent years but he shipped criticism for what was viewed as a negative style of play, particularly at a time when Fitzgerald’s Corofin were earning rave reviews for their displays.</p>
      <p>Fitzgerald said: “I remember Padraic, when I was playing with him, very knowledgeable guy.</p>
      <p>“When he speaks, he talks, he says the right stuff. It was a kind of thing where he didn’t say an awful lot in the dressing room but when he was talking, he was talking sense.</p>
      <p>“I have heard him on radio commentary since then and I think he is very good as well. He knows his football. He loves playing the go forward game.</p>

      <p>“He wants kicking into the full-forward. He played full-forward for years and he wanted that ball in quick and early and he’ll definitely try and do that.”</p>
      <p>Fitzgerald appreciates why Walsh was more conservative, however.</p>
      <p>“We used to play attractive football but we used to concede huge, cricket scores, and I was part of it.</p>
      <p>“We weren't getting anywhere, and I know where Kevin was coming from with that, because I know he commented before that the Kerry guys used to love playing Galway.</p>
      <p>“Of course they did, because we used to let them play football.</p>
      <p>“From a supporter’s point of view, I understood that you have to be defensively sound, and I know what Kevin was trying to do there. You have to be like that.</p>
      <p>“But maybe with the players like Damien Comer, Shane Walsh, Brannigan, Ian Burke, we could have been a little bit more expansive, pushed the boat out a little bit more.”</p>
