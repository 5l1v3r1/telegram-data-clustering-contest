      <p>All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday urged all those involved in party politicking to see election as a democratic contest and not a do-or-die affair.</p>
      <p>The party, in a statement condemning the violence that trailed the election in Kogi State, which has led to the killing of a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) women leader, Salome Abuh and destruction of property in the state, said the APC abhors violence.</p>
      <p>The statement, signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, however condoled with the family of the deceased PDP women leader and all others affected by the violence.</p>
      <p>Warning against political violence in any form, the party reiterated an earlier advice by President Muhammadu Buhari that anyone dissatisfied with the outcome of the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states should seek redress in court.</p>

      <p>The statement reads: “The All Progressives Congress (APC) condemns the post-election violence reported in Kogi State which led to the death of a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) woman leader, Salome Abuh and destruction of property in the state.</p>
      <p>“The Party condoles with the family of the deceased and others affected by the post-election violence.</p>
      <p>“While the Kogi police command says the killing was as a result of a reprisal attack, we urge the Kogi people to ensure this does not escalate. We are aware that the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has already directed law enforcement agencies to fish out the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>“The APC abhors violence and other criminalities, which sadly continue to plague our electioneering process. We urge partisans to see election as a democratic contest and not a do or die affair that we pay with our lives. We pray that the culprits are caught and the full weight of the law is brought to bear on them.</p>
      <p>“President Muhammadu Buhari has advised partisans that are not satisfied with the results of governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states to seek redress in court and shun violence. We must all heed this call.”</p>
