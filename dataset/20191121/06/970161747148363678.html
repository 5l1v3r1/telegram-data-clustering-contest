      <p>Demi Lovato made fans take a double take as she showed off a sizeable baby bump on Instagram… but it’s all for her guest appearance in Will &amp; Grace.</p>
      <p>The singer, 27, posted a photo of her cradling the bump in a polka dot dress as she told her followers: ‘Real or fake? #WillandGrace #MeetJenny’.</p>
      <p>Despite the caption giving the game away that the bump was in fact fake, her followers shared their shock at the photo in the comments.</p>
      <p>They posted: ‘Literally just had a mini heart attack’, ‘Before I read the caption I was hyped af. Mama demi’ and ‘oh lawddd my heart dropped for a sec’.</p>
      <p>Others added: ‘DEMI DONT PLAY W ME LIKE THIS’ and ‘Ooh gurl unless you got 7 months pregnant in like 3 months than that’s the Lords baby’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/demi-lovato-loved-shares-adorable-snap-new-boyfriend-11088916/">Demi had recently gone public with her new boyfriend Austin Wilson</a>, so fans were quick to assume she had some more big news to spill before they read the caption.</p>
