      <p>The United States government has condemned the <a href="https://iharare.com/the-moment-when-zrp-indiscriminately-beat-up-civilians-in-harare-cbd/">brutality used by the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP)</a> today when they indiscriminately attacked civilians.</p>
      <p>The police officers threw teargas and indiscriminately attacked every person who was near and around the Morgan Richard Tsvangirai House (formerly Harvest House) and Nelson Mandela Avenue.</p>
      <p>Assistant Secretary for U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of African Affairs Tibor Nagy urged President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government to respect the 2013 Constitution.</p>
      <p>Writing on social media site <a href="https://twitter.com/AsstSecStateAF/status/1197190521850126339">Twitter Nagy</a> said,</p>
      <aside>We are concerned by the police’s unprovoked use of force against peaceably assembled Zimbabweans today and call on the Government of Zimbabwe to cease such violence against its own population.<br/>We note that the passage of new legislation has had no impact on the actions of the Government of Zimbabwe’s respect of freedom of assembly and other rights. We urge the Government of Zimbabwe to respect its 2013 Constitution in permitting non-violent public gatherings.</aside>

      <p>The police’s heavy-handedness in dealing with civilians had been roundly condemned by Zimbabweans on social media platforms. The police’s actions resulted in severe injuries to some passers-by who got caught in the crossfire.  One elderly man sustained a deep cut on his head while another woman suffered a broken leg.  Numerous other people sustained multiple injuries and had to receive medical treatment.</p>
