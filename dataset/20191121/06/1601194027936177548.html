      <p>The British #4 ranked Welterweight Contender <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/leon-edwards">Leon Edwards</a> has been on the rise for the last few years. He's currently riding an 8-fight win streak that includes wins over <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/donald-cerrone">Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone</a>, Vicente Luque and more recently, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rafael-dos-anjos">Rafael Dos Anjos</a>.</p>
      <p>He's in an upward trajectory despite not having gotten a finish in one and a half years. The logical next step for him would be to either face a top-5 ranked contender or a former champion. He is expected to get both in one go as Tyron Woodley seems to be the next man in line for him.</p>
      <p>Woodley has been open about the fact that he wants to get back in the mix as soon as January, but it seems as though he hasn't accepted a fight as yet. Damon Martin of <i>MMAFighting </i>reported on Twitter that Edwards' manager said that his team has spoken to UFC at length for the last three months about a fight against Tyron Woodley. However, <i>The Chosen One </i>has yet to accept the fight.</p>
      <p>Martin further stated that Edwards is determined not to take a step back, so Woodley is the logical choice as his next opponent.</p>

      <p>It's a great match-up, even if it's one that may not be the most exciting for some fans. Leon Edwards has garnered that reputation of not being the most exciting fighter so if he wants a guaranteed title shot, he's probably going to have to finish Woodley. His last defeat came four years ago when he lost by unanimous decision to the current champion Kamaru Usman.</p>
      <p>However, even with a win against Woodley, he may have to wait it out a bit longer as UFC would undoubtedly give Jorge Masvidal a title shot over him. Who deserves the opportunity more? Masvidal or Edwards?</p>
