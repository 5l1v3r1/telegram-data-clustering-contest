      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> With the top decision-making body of the Congress meeting a party chief Sonia Gandhi’s house on Thursday, the <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/maharashtra-will-have-stable-govt-uncertainty-will-end-says-prithviraj-chavan-after-ncp-congress-meet-3851132/">Maharashtra deadlock</a> is set to finally get a breakthrough.

      <p>According to reports, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena have finally worked out a common agenda, but the terms of power-sharing are not yet final. On Wednesday, the Congress-NCP meeting took place hours after NCP chief Sharad Pawar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss farm crisis in the state.</p>
      <p>As Congress’ Kerala ally Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has urged Congress to ditch the Sena, it is speculated that Sena may be asked to dial down their Hindutva ideology.</p>
      <p>“There are many points on which we need clarification if we have to run a government together for five years. Discussions are progressing. We will go to Mumbai today,” said Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former Maharashtra CM, Sanjay Nirupam expressed his displeasure over the alliance and tweeted that it doesn’t look promising for the Congress to become the third party in an alliance.</p>

      <p>After reports emerged that Congress has been insisting on the need to stress on the word ‘secular’ in the common minimum programme, Sena MP Sanjay Raut said, this country runs on secularism which is stressed in the Constitution. Sources said that the Sena and the Congress had an issue over the word ‘secularism’. The two parties, however, later decided to adhere to Preamble of Indian constitution.</p>
      <p>Another thorny issue that remains to be solved is the split chief ministership. It’s not clear whether Shiv Sena would like to split the chair with the NCP for 2.5 years as this was the bone of contention between the Sena and the BJP.</p>
