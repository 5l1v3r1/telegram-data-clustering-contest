      <p>Police arrested 42-year-old Scott Gelardi as he arrived for work Tuesday at Northside Elementary School. He is suspected of hiding a camera in a boys’ bathroom at the school, which allegedly caught video and photographs of students.</p>
      <p>“They’re just kids. They’re just innocent kids coming to school to learn,” said grandparent Cathy Trevino.</p>
      <p>Maintenance workers found the camera in the bathroom Monday. No children in the footage have been identified because none of their faces were seen.</p>
      <p>Police searched Gelardi’s home and the rest of the school. They say they have no evidence of any physical contact with students. No other devices were found in the school.</p>
      <p>Gelardi is charged with possession of child pornography, a third-degree felony, and possession of child pornography with the intent to promote, a second-degree felony.</p>
      <p>The El Campo Independent School District says Gelardi was a third-party contractor working for the school. They say they conduct background checks on anyone working at their schools.</p>
      <p>“Reevaluate your staff. These are somebody else’s kids. These are not your children, but it is your job, your obligation to make sure these kids are safe,” Trevino said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the district said a substitute teacher was fired after filming pornography inside a classroom at El Campo High School. Police also investigated a food worker at another school, who was allegedly sending inappropriate messages to students.</p>
