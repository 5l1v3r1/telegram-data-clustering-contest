        <b>England and Wales have secured Euro 2020 qualification, whilst the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland will have to go through to a Nations League play-off. Now attention has turned back to the Premier League. Manchester United will travel to Sheffield United on Sunday afternoon, with Liverpool facing Crystal Palace and Manchester City facing Chelsea.</b>

      <p>Manchester United looked certain to land Mario Mandzukic in the January transfer window, but now it looks as though an ex-Manchester City man could be the preferred target for the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/man-utd-transfer-news-edin-dzeko-mario-mandzukic-11189438/">Metr</a>o, United are now keen on bringing Edin Dzeko to Old Trafford in the winter window.</p>
      <p>Dzeko spent a number of years at Manchester City, even scoring a goal in their famous 3-2 win over QPR that clinched the Premier League title at Manchester United's expense in May 2014.</p>
      <p>United bosses are said to be concerned with a lack of recent activity from Mandzukic, so Roma forward Dzeko may be the better option as the club seek to bring in a striker.</p>
