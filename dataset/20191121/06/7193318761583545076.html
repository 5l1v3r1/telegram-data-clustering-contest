      <p>Gov. Kevin Stitt named Tishomingo lawyer Dustin Rowe to the Oklahoma Supreme Court on Wednesday, filling out the court with a Chickasaw Nation district judge who was once known for being one of the youngest mayors in state history.</p>
      <p>Rowe, 44, a registered Republican, was one of three candidates sent to Stitt by the Judicial Nominating Commission. The others were Bryan County District Judge Mark Campbell and LeFlore County District Judge Jonathan K. Sullivan.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Rowe is an accomplished lawyer and dedicated Oklahoman who has an impressive legal background,” Stitt said.</p>
      <p>“His proven record in both his private practice and as a tribal court judge speaks to his qualifications to join the highest court in Oklahoma. Rowe’s reputation of fairness, passion for the legal system, and heart for his community is evident. I am confident he will serve our state with integrity in order to support and defend the state’s constitution and uphold the rule of law.”</p>
      <p>Rowe, who owns a law firm in Tishomingo, said, "I am honored and humbled by the trust Governor Stitt has placed in me. I will work diligently on the Oklahoma Supreme Court to uphold the constitution of our great state."</p>
      <p>Rowe does not have to be confirmed by either house of the Legislature. Justices appear on statewide retention ballots every six years.</p>
      <p>Stitt has now named two of the nine high court justices in his first year as governor. That's as many as former Gov. Mary Fallin named in eight years.</p>
      <p>Stitt's first pick was M. John Kane IV, 57, of Pawhuska, who took his seat on the bench in September.</p>
      <p>Rowe succeeds Patrick Wyrick in the District 2 seat, which includes 13 counties in southeastern Oklahoma. Wyrick left the court earlier this year to become a federal district judge in Oklahoma City. Wyrick was one of Fallin's court picks.</p>
      <p>Rowe was elected mayor of Tishomingo when he was 18 years old. In 2012, he ran unsuccessfully for Congress.</p>
      <p>U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Westville, who defeated Rowe in the Republican primary in 2012, said Wednesday, "I can’t think of a better person than Dustin Rowe to serve on the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. Dustin will uphold our state’s constitution and serve our state with integrity."</p>
