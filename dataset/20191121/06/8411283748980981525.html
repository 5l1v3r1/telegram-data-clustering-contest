      <h1>Leadframe maker Jih Lin looks to return to growth track in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:27:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:27</time> by <a rel="author">Julian Ho, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Taiwan-based leadframe maker Jih Lin Technology expects its revenues to resume growth in 2020 on renewed demand for diverse leadframes from international IDMs for packaging automotive power devices such as MOSFET, IGBT, and WBG semiconductors including SiC and GaN components and for processing logic ICs for 5G and AI applications.</p>
      <p>The company, with around 90% of revenues contributed by international IDMs reportedly including Infineon, TI, On-Semi, Vishay, Mitsubishi, and STM, registered a capacity utilization rate of only 50-60% in the first half of 2019, as many IDMs were focusing more efforts on digesting inventories amid the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the firm's revenues for 2019 is estimated to fall only 10% on year to NT$4.5 billion (US$147.49 million), with the decline rate lower than the industry average due to the firm's diverse clientele, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>IDMs are expected to complete inventory adjustments by the end of 2019 and may resume order replacement in 2020, company chairman SY Tsai said, adding that Jih Lin's dual gauge copper leadframes developed in house may help the company win more orders from IDMs as the offering boasts good heat dissipation performance and is suitable for processing automotive MOSFET, IGBT and WBG power devices.</p>
      <p>The company is gearing up for capacity expansions at its plants in Taiwan and China's Suzhou and Jinan to meet growing demand for automotive, 5G and AI applications.</p>
      <p>Its plant in southern Taiwan will expand capacity by 60% for leadframes for medium and high-voltage single power devices and modules. And its Suzhou plant complex is undergoing phase-II construction aiming to satisfy future huge demand for 5G, household appliances and electric vehicles applications in China, according to the firm's deputy general manager and spokesman MW Tsai.</p>
