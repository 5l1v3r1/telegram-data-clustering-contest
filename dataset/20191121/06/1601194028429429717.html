      <h3>Rhea on making the most of her opportunities</h3>
      <p>Tonight's episode of WWE NXT kicked things off with the return of WWE RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch to the NXT Arena for the first time in almost three years. The Man is slated to have a triple threat match between WWE NXT Women's Champion Shayna Baszler and WWE SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley at Survivor Series this coming Sunday to establish brand supremacy.</p>
      <p>Becky came out to the ring and said that even though Triple H issued an open invitation for tonight, she was coming anyway. She had some strong words for Shayna Baszler and Bayley, while also going on to issue a challenge to Baszler and the Horsewomen to come down to the ring. Her challenge was however met by Rhea Ripley.</p>
      <p>The match between Ripley and Lynch was going perfectly but was interrupted due to interference from Baszler and the Horsewomen. Ripley spoke to a backstage correspondent after her match and said that careers in NXT are built on opportunities and tonight she made the most of it.</p>
      <p>Additionally, she also had some choice words for both Lynch and Baszler.</p>
      <blockquote>Around here, careers are built on opportunities. Tonight I took my opportunity to prove to the so-called Man[Becky Lynch] that around here in NXT, she's not The Man. As for Shayna Baszler and her Muppets[Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir]? NXT TakeOver: WarGames, I'm gonna take my opportunity.</blockquote>
