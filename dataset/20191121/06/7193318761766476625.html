      <p>On Dec. 10, voters will decide on a fourth iteration of MAPS, so The Oklahoman has assembled an expert panel to discuss developments in the urban core as they relate to proposed MAPS 4 projects.</p>
      <p>How will MAPS 4, especially the less-publicized aspects, fit in with the future American Indian Cultural Center and adjoining commercial development being planned by the Chickasaw Nation? How will corridor improvements, a low water dam, appearance upgrades for highway bridges and pedestrian crossings link south shore cultural and commercial development led by the Chickasaws with the boathouse district and plans for commercial development on the north shore of the Oklahoma River?</p>
      <p>Connections attractions also are proposed as part of the Innovation District MAPS 4 improvements, while development in and around the Chesapeake Energy Arena and a multi-use stadium might go far beyond what is being proposed to voters.</p>
      <p>Our panel on Dec. 3 will include Mayor David Holt; Gov. Bill Anoatubby of the Chickasaw Nation; Katy Evans Boren, president and CEO of the Oklahoma City Innovation District; Mike Knopp, executive director of the Oklahoma City Boathouse Foundation; Darren Ransley with the OKC FC Energy; and Berry Tramel, sports columnist at The Oklahoman. Moderator will be Steve Lackmeyer, business reporter and columnist.</p>
      <p>The panel has been carefully selected to delve into the details of both the MAPS 4 proposals for the urban core and how they fit into other public and private development.</p>
      <p>The event is for anyone interested in where downtown real estate development is heading, to get a grasp of what's coming. It will be from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Sheraton Oklahoma City Downtown Hotel, 1 N Broadway Ave. Tickets are $40 and include a reception with light hors dâ€™oeuvres, beer and wine at 5:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>For tickets, go to Oklahoman.com. For more information, call 475-3284 or email cbunyan@oklahoman.com.</p>
