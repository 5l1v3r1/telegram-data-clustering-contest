      <p>Melbourne's Marvel Stadium is expected to host 50,000 witnesses from 71 countries for the International Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses from Friday to Saturday. It is set to top the stadium's biggest AFL crowd this year with 48,278 fans flocking to the Essendon-North Melbourne clash on Good Friday.</p>
