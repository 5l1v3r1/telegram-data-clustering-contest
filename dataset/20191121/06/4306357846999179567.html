      <h3>Michael Owen is tipping Liverpool FC to ease to a straightforward win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Reds moved eight points clear of their title rivals in the last round of Premier League fixtures earlier in November.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC were 3-1 winners against defending champions Manchester City to underline their title credentials.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside outfit are nine points clear of Pep Guardiola’s side in the title race.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC have won 11 of their 12 games in the Premier League so far this season season.</p>
      <p>Only Manchester United have managed to deny Liverpool FC victory following a 1-1 stalemate at Old Trafford last month.</p>
      <p>Palace lost 2-0 to Liverpool FC’s title rivals Chelsea FC in their last league fixture before the international break.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC striker Owen is backing the Reds to beat Crystal Palace to maintain their momentum in the title race.</p>
      <p>“Palace have picked up just one point – at the Emirates – from their last four league games and have lost 2-0 against City, Leicester and Chelsea in that sequence,” Owen told <i>BetVictor</i>.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool have an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League and I would be surprised if the Eagles stopped the Reds in their tracks such is the current form and confidence surrounding Jurgen Klopp’s squad.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC finished in second place in the Premier League table last season and a point adrift of champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The Reds have made a stronger start to the current campaign after securing victories over Arsenal, Chelsea FC, Leicester City, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are the Champions League holders following a 2-0 win against Spurs in the final last term.</p>
