      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/frankie-edgar">Frankie Edgar</a> is all set to make his 135-pound debut as he takes on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cory-sandhagen">Cory Sandhagen</a> in the co-main event of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> Fight Night on January 25th. Sandhagen is currently riding a 5-fight win streak in the UFC and sits ranked at #3, perhaps just one win away from a title shot.</p>
      <p>Sandhagen expressed some sadness over having to put the stamp on Edgar's career, stating that a move down to 135 was probably not the best idea and also revealing that Edgar's post-fight interview at UFC 240 indicated that the legend needed to retire.</p>
      <p>Edgar, however, remains positive and when appearing on <i><a href="http://www.ufcunfiltered.com/">UFC Unfiltered</a></i>, seemed excited about the prospect of facing the #3 ranked guy on his Bantamweight debut (H/T Credits <i><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/frankie-edgar-views-cory-sandhagen-as-opportunity-to-climb-bantamweight-rankings-quickly">MMA Junkie</a></i>):</p>
      <blockquote>“For a guy like Cory to come in and fight someone like myself is definitely good for him, but to me I’m looking at it (like) he’s No. 3, and it’s definitely a good way to get myself on a ladder in the 135-pound division.”</blockquote>
      <p>He said that everyone has been pestering him for years to move down to Bantamweight as he won't have a size disadvantage at 135 and the perfect opportunity came up:</p>
      <blockquote>"Everyone’s been telling for years to go down. My coaches were telling me for a while, and I fought for the ’45-pound belt a couple times, came up short. I felt like now’s the time if I’m going to do it ever.”</blockquote>
      <p>While Sandhagen stands at 5'11 and has a clear size advantage, Edgar believes that down the line, he won't be facing opponents as big:</p>
      <blockquote>"Although I don’t think I’ll be the biggest guy at bantamweight, but I’m not going to be giving up as much size as say, 145, but I mean you got to take into consideration the guys are going to be quicker down at bantamweight, as well."</blockquote>
      <p>He noted that he has to take into account the speed that fighters possess at 135 and that each division comes with its challenges.</p>
