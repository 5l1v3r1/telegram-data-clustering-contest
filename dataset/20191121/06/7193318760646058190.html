      <p>The nation’s oil and natural gas industry is awash in production thanks to technological and operational improvements.</p>
      <p>But that success also flooded the industry with private equity investments that only accelerated oversupply issues, Harold Hamm, Continental Resources’ chairman and CEO, told an audience of several hundred at the Dug Midcontinent conference in Oklahoma City on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Our energy renaissance is the best thing that has happened since oil was found in Saudi Arabia. It is huge,” Hamm said, but added, “it probably wouldn’t have been quite as bad, but there were a lot of elements from the market side, private equity players, that overloaded the sector.”</p>
      <p>“The early people who came in and took an equity position and then flipped it to someone else made a lot of money. They did well,” he said. But those that followed? Not so much.</p>
      <p>“Today, we just say that model is broken, because a lot (of companies and investors) are stuck,” Hamm said. “A lot of folks who raised their money from investors basically have been burned and stung, and that helped sour the market.”</p>
      <p>Still, he said it has been a remarkable decade for the industry.</p>
      <p>Before 2008, diesel was retailing for more than $4 a gallon while most believed the globe's future energy supply mainly would be provided by bitumen produced in Canada.</p>
      <p>These days, diesel is about as cheap as a gallon of unleaded gas.</p>
      <p>“The Bakken — a natural shale play — lit it up for America,” he said. “It was a game changer that had a profound impact on the national market.”</p>
      <p>During a conversational interview between himself and Nissa Darbonne, editor-at-large at Oil and Gas Investor, Hamm also talked about OPEC’s ability to influence world crude markets in light of the U.S.’s ability to export crude, about Continental Resources’ success in finding and developing key oil resources, about work the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance did to get Congress to allow crude oil exports, about one of the alliance’s current focuses, about the current political environment and about his thoughts on the future.</p>
      <p>
        <b>OPEC’s concern</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamm estimated Wednesday that Saudi Arabia needs oil at $80 a barrel to have enough money to adequately operate its country.</p>
      <p>But he said its ability to impact the market in a meaningful way continues to diminish as the U.S. oil and gas industry, which has been able to export crude since 2016, continues to build out what it needs to adequately put its supplies on the world market.</p>
      <p>He noted the price differential between West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude continues to narrow as that process evolves.</p>
      <p>“In 2014, they thought they could bust us and didn’t quite get that done,” Hamm said. “After they oversupplied global markets, they cut back, but they misjudged and didn’t cut back enough.</p>
      <p>“If we were getting what OPEC was getting all along, it would be a totally different story."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Continental’s success</b>
      </p>
      <p>“We have a great team (of geologists and engineers), a lot of talent that honors the science … and have a nose for finding oil,” Hamm said. “But it is more than just finding oil — we wanted to find complete fields.”</p>
      <p>Hamm told Darbonne Continental purposely seeks oil because of its value.</p>
      <p>“Gas is ubiquitous. It is everywhere, easier to find in large quantities,” he said. “What has happened with shale? We have found a lot of both.</p>
      <p>"Don’t get me wrong. It is great to be fortunate and lucky in this business.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alliance tasks remain</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamm agreed with Darbonne that the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance’s achievement to change federal law to allow oil exports remains one of its most notable.</p>
      <p>He said the alliance, which he chairs, is working on several energy-related issues today, including a push to get federal oversight of natural gas pipeline projects changed so that it mirrors the administrative review process the federal government already follows when considering and approving lines that carry oil.</p>
      <p>Hamm noted that it typically can take a year or longer to get a natural gas pipeline project through an approval process before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p>
      <p>“Today, there are $115 billion of gas projects held up because FERC hasn’t made the approvals,” he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>About the future</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamm said he and his team recently looked at Continental Resources’ performance since the firm went public in 2007.</p>
      <p>“What we saw is, it has been very cyclic, like a saw tooth, if you will,” he said.</p>
      <p>There’s no doubt, he agreed, most public companies now are pulling in their horns with a realization the supply and demand market needs to be balanced again.</p>
      <p>“A reduction in capital expenditures is a huge part of what everybody has to do,” Hamm said.</p>
      <p>“It seems simple, but it is somewhat painful. If you are a private equity and you are guaranteed a delivery, to choose not to do it is tough.”</p>
      <p>However, Hamm said he expects the industry will eventually recover from its current malaise, provided investors and the companies they support are willing.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma and the nation, he told audience members, hold more oil and natural gas than many believed.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma, for example, has tripled its oil production and doubled its natural gas production since horizontal drilling and completion techniques in shale plays took hold, he said.</p>
      <p>In part, Hamm attributed that to existing infrastructure that midstream companies already had in place as shale development activities began ramping up in west-central and northwest Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>He also credited those companies and others for building out significant recent projects to help move natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil from the field to market.</p>
      <p>“We are not as constrained as some places are, not like the Permian,” he said.</p>
      <p>And despite an ongoing political climate that is polarized between environmentalists seeking to declare war on fossil fuels and seemingly everyone else, Hamm was generally upbeat about the future, despite current market conditions.</p>
      <p>He also encouraged audience members to learn their trades well, saying, “you can do what I have done if you work hard, put it together, get a little bit lucky and find some oil.</p>
      <p>“The future is bright,” Hamm said, noting fossil fuels will still be a major energy supplier for the nation for at least another half-century.</p>
      <p>“We just need commodity prices to recover. We all we be a lot happier if that happens.”</p>
