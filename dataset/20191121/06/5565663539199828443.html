      <p>The Assistant Secretary for United States Department of State's Bureau of African Affairs Tibor Naggy says America is concerned by the brutal crackdown on opposition members that took place at the MDC offices on Wednesday. <br/><br/>In a statement on Wednesday Tibor said, "We are concerned by the police's unprovoked use of force against peaceably assembled Zimbabweans today and call on the Government of Zimbabwe to cease such violence against its own population."<br/><br/>Tibor added that the newly passed Maintenance of Public Order Act does not guarantee the people freedoms of assembly. <br/><br/>"We note that the passage of new legislation has had no impact on the actions of the Government of Zimbabwe's respect of freedom of assembly and other rights. We urge the Government of Zimbabwe to respect its 2013 Constitution in permitting non-violent public gatherings."<br/><br/>Meanwhile the United Kingdom Foreign Office Director Harriet Lucy Mathews CMG OBE said MOPA should be realigned with the constitution of the country.<br/><br/>"Whilst I welcomed news that Mnangagwa signed MOPA into law, the real test is how it is implemented in line with the spirit of the constitution. Reports today (Wednesday) of a heavy handed police response and restrictions on freedom of assembly are of concern."<br/><br/>Hundreds of MDC supporters were beaten by police after congregating at the party offices waiting for the Hope of the nation address by their leader Nelson Chamisa.</p>
