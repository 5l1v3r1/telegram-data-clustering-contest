      <p>That is the view of former F1 driver JJ Lehto, who told the Finnish newspaper Iltalehti that Michael Schumacher's son may even have been under consideration for a 2020 debut with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/sauber/"><b>Alfa Romeo</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, 20-year-old Schumacher is set to finish just 12th overall in his debut season of F2.</p>
      <p>"You're only as good as your last race," Lehto, who was once Michael Schumacher's teammate at Benetton in the mid 90s, said.</p>
      <p>"There were a lot of ups and downs with the results. So the speculation about Formula 1 stopped for him.</p>
      <p>"Now he needs to do a good season in Formula 2 next year."</p>
      <p>Lehto says he has nothing against Schumacher eventually making his way onto the F1 grid.</p>
      <p>"Yes, the guy has talent," he said. "But a lot still has to be developed before he achieves his goal of getting to Formula 1.</p>
      <p>"The name helps with that, but you also have to win championships."</p>
