      <p>Lou Williams scored 27 points, and Paul George added 25 points and eight assists to help the Los Angeles Clippers notch a 107-104 overtime victory over the visiting Boston Celtics on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Kawhi Leonard returned from a three-game absence caused by a knee injury to score 17 points on 7-of-20 shooting. Patrick Beverley corralled a career-best 16 rebounds to go along with 14 points and seven assists, and JaMychal Green added 10 points as Los Angeles won its third straight game.</p>
      <p>Jayson Tatum scored a season-best 30 points for Boston. Marcus Smart recorded 15 points and eight assists, Brad Wanamaker added 14 points, and Kemba Walker had 13 points and nine rebounds.</p>
      <p>The contest marked the first time George and Leonard played together since both joined the Clippers in the offseason. Wednesday’s game was George’s fourth of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The Clippers led by five points nearly two minutes into the overtime before Boston pulled within two. Beverley drilled a 3-pointer to make it 107-102 with 43.9 seconds remaining before Tatum’s dunk pulled Boston within three with 34.7 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Tatum missed a tying 3-point attempt with 2.6 seconds left, and Leonard blocked Walker’s last-gasp 3-point attempt just before time expired.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles shot 41.9 percent from the field and was 17 of 45 (37.8 percent) from 3-point range while committing 23 turnovers.</p>
      <p>Boston had 18 miscues and shot 39.4 percent from the field, including 12 of 45 (26.7 percent) from 3-point range. Daniel Theis collected 14 rebounds for the Celtics.</p>
      <p>An acrobatic driving hoop by Smart gave Boston a 94-87 lead with 2:21 remaining in regulation before the Clippers rattled off 10 straight points.</p>
      <p>Beverley buried a corner 3-pointer, and Montrezl Harrell scored on the inside to bring Los Angeles within two with 1:37 left.</p>
      <p>Williams connected on a go-ahead 3-pointer with 31.7 seconds left and added two free throws 11 seconds later to give the Clippers a 97-94 lead.</p>
      <p>Tatum answered by draining a 3-pointer to tie it with 13.1 seconds remaining. Leonard missed a potential winning 3-pointer as time expired.</p>
