      <h1>Perth council drafts law to ban wheel clamping in WA first</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:25:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:25</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Pond</a></address>
      <p>THE City of Stirling has become WA’s first local government to <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/stirling-times/news/stirling-declares-war-on-wheel-clamping/">draft a law to ban wheel clamping</a>.</p>
      <p>The council on November 19 approved releasing its draft immobilisation and detention of vehicles local law for public comment.</p>
      <p>Council officers initially proposed banning clamping only in free parking areas but this was changed by the council to include parking on private property.</p>
      <p>Mayor Mark Irwin, who <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/stirling-times/news/stirling-mayors-ambitious-goals-for-perths-biggest-council/">pushed for the ban as part of his recent re-election bid</a>, welcomed the decision.</p>
      <p>“The current penalty imposed for vehicles detained is disproportionate to the crime,” he said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Private businesses have the right to protect parking on their private property but we as a council feel that wheel clamping is not the right method.</p>
      <p>“Other states such as Victoria and NSW have had a wheel clamping ban in place for some time and we would like to see this introduced within the City of Stirling.”</p>
      <p>The law would apply across Stirling except in paid carparks controlled by access gates and instances such as a mechanic requiring payment for repairs before the vehicle can be collected or where a government officer has power to detain a vehicle.</p>
      <p>Offenders could expect a $500 fine or up to $5000 if the matter was heard in court.</p>
      <p>A report by council staff said it was unclear if the City had the power to make the law, with no other councils having attempted it before.</p>
      <p>The proposal will be open for feedback until January 31 then return to the council.</p>
      <p>If it is supported, it will be put to the State Parliament’s Committee on Delegated Legislation to decide if it is valid.</p>
      <p>Drivers have long complained about wheel clamping in the carpark of businesses on Scarborough Beach Road in Scarborough since 2017, <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/stirling-times/news/scarborough-business-owners-concerned-at-wheel-clamping/">as first reported by the Stirling Times in 2017</a> and a petition was <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/western-suburbs-weekly/news/support-rolls-in-for-wheel-clamping-ban/">submitted to the City in September</a>.</p>
