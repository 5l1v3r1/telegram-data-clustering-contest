        <b>An extradition hearing for a man wanted in connection with the deaths of 39 people who were found in a trailer in Essex is due to begin today.</b>
      </p>
      <p>22-year-old Eamon Harrison from Mayobridge, Co Down is challenging his surrender to UK authorities.</p>
      <p>Police in the UK suspect he delivered the container to a Belgian port the day before it left for England.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gardaí have identified the body of the man found dead in a burning car in west Dublin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>DNA tests show the victim was 42-year-old Wayne Whelan, who was known for his involvement in serious crime.</p>
      <p>He died after being shot a number of times, before the car was set alight in Lucan on Monday night.</p>
      <p>***</p>

        <b>More than 200 children have attended school so little over the past two years that their parents or guardians have been issued with legal proceedings by Tusla.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the Child and Family Agency feels a child is being neglected in this regard, it sends a warning letter.</p>
      <p>These were issued in connection with 778 individual children between January 2018 and this August.</p>

        <b>Three men are due in court this morning in connection with attacks on sex workers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gardaí raided three properties on Tuesday and arrested four men, who are aged between 18 and 37.</p>
      <p>One man was released without charge, while the others will appear before a special sitting of Roscommon District Court this morning.</p>

        <b>Ryanair has criticised a Spanish court ruling that described an extra charge in its baggage policy as "abusive".</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Provincial Court of Madrid ruled the airline must refund a passenger €20, stating they were unfairly charged the fee for having a 10 kilo bag but no 'priority' ticket.</p>
      <p>It has also ordered the company to remove the clause from its terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>Ryanair says the ruling "misinterpreted" its commercial freedoms and won't affect its baggage policy.</p>
