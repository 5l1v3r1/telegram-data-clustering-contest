      <p>Oseberg, an Oklahoma City-based upstream oil and natural gas data company, announced the release of a new market intelligence product for the New Mexico oil and natural gas industry.</p>
      <p>Operators now have direct access from within one application to multiple sources of New Mexico public oil and natural gas information, including Federal Bureau of Land Management, State Land Office, Oil Conservation Division (OCD) and county courthouse records.</p>
      <p>The data is accessible through Oseberg's flagship search &amp; mapping application, Atla, along with dataStream Web Services and Oseberg's ArcGIS Map Services.</p>
      <p>"This new dataset is already helping our clients find mineral owners, map pools by formation, navigate through federal leases and communitizations and determine working interest and overriding royalties," project manager Cris Byers said. "It's a treasure trove of data that has been difficult to find all in one place in the past."</p>
