        <b>A new research institute will not only help Singapore grow more of its own food but also bring new dishes to tables.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new institute could attract significant international investments into Singapore, which hopes to become a major player in the food and nutrition space.</p>
      <p>For this, the Republic hopes to ride on its strength in technology, and the Singapore Institute of Food and Biotechnology Innovation is tipped to play a key role.</p>
      <p>It will be set up by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) by the middle of next year and will look into areas such as alternative proteins and even the way food is grown, tastes or is absorbed by the body.</p>
      <p>One of the projects it will house involves local start-up Eatobe, which is seeking to process and transform grains, nuts and seeds to make it easier for the body to digest and absorb the nutrients.</p>
      <p>The new institute is also part of Singapore's efforts to produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030 - or what it terms its "30 by 30" target, said Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry, at the launch of the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Week.</p>
      <p>Singapore currently imports 90 per cent of its food, which makes it vulnerable in case climate change hits global production.</p>
      <p>Highlighting the opportunities that technology has created for the sector, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat pointed to the potential growth of the agri-food industry in Asia, which was projected to double its spending on food over the next decade - from US$4 trillion (S$5.4 trillion) now to US$8 trillion.</p>
      <p>"In 2018 alone, agri-food technology start-ups raised nearly US$17 billion globally, a 40 per cent increase over the previous year," said Mr Heng.</p>
      <p>The institute will not only attract international investments but also make local companies more productive through innovation, said Dr Benjamin Seet, assistant chief executive of the Biomedical Research Council at A*Star.</p>
      <p>Mr Heng also pointed to the global benefits of such research. Globally, around 800 million people live in hunger, and Asia alone has 300 million smallholder farms.</p>
      <p>By improving crop yield and productivity, "we can improve the lives of these farmers and their families and bring more food to consumers", he said.</p>
