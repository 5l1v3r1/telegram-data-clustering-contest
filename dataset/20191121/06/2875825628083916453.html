      <h1>Niall Scannell claims he is a better player after World Cup disappointment</h1>
      <h2>Munster face Racing 92 in Limerick on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Rory Best's retirement has created a vacancy in the hooker position for Ireland and Niall Scannell is in pole position to fill it in the Six Nations in February.</p>
      <p>After his displays in Japan, the Munster no. 2 can further his claim with new Ireland boss Andy Farrell for what's ahead with strong displays in the Champions Cup between now and the championship opener against Scotland.</p>
      <p>Next up, the home showdown with Racing on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"You've heard already the World Cup didn't end the way we wanted it to," said Scannell.</p>
      <p>"Having had a few weeks off to reflect I've been able to go, 'Maybe two years ago I wasn't odds-on to get on that plane'.</p>
      <p>"So I was delighted to get there - and the experience certainly didn't leave me down at all. It was incredible.</p>
      <p>"Obviously the ending just puts that bit of a sour note on it.</p>
      <p>"But if I look on it as an experience more so in my life as opposed to my rugby career, it's huge.</p>
      <p>"I'm grateful. It's probably going to an experience has given me a huge hunger to kick on.</p>
      <p>"I definitely want to go to another one, if I can last it."</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old feels that he has returned a better player after rubbing shoulders with players preparing for the highest pressure games of their career.</p>
      <p>"There are certainly things that I'll take that can only make you a better player, ultimately."</p>
      <p>Now Scannell is loving the chance to work with new Munster scrum coach Graeme Rowntree, who arrived with a big reputation from his time with England and the Lions.</p>

      <p>Scannell had never met Rowntree before - and new man's first question to him was, 'What's your nickname'?</p>
      <p>The Corkman grinned: "He hasn't climbed into a scrum yet but we're still in the honeymoon phase!</p>
      <p>"He's hands-on,  he's high energy and a good character. He made us feel very at ease straight away.  </p>
      <p>"He's just good craic, which is refreshing. We have our front row meetings with the 'scrum connoisseurs', as he calls us - a new term that's a bit more flattering than what the backs call us, anyway!</p>
      <p>"So at least we have someone fighting our corner as well! It's exciting, having a fellah who is a legend like that, just to get nuggets off."</p>
      <p>Scannell admits it took time to adjust to changes made by Rowntree and new attack coach Stephen Larkham, but he could sense it coming together in the Champions Cup opening win at Ospreys.</p>
      <p>Grateful for what he has learned from a young age from Jerry Flannery, and from Greg Feek with Ireland, Scannell is eager to learn off the new man.</p>
      <p>"It's a bit of a different energy, a different flavour around the place. I'm sure there's much more that he wants to implement."</p>
      <p>However Scannell believes it will take a massive effort for the Munster pack to win the scrum battle with their Racing counterparts, whose form has helped them to the Top 14 summit.</p>
      <p>"It's nothing really hugely surprising to us because we've played against them," he remarked. "Some of their stuff looks so simple, but they're so effective at it."</p>
      <p>He praises Racing's "strong, athletic and clinical" pack and a lineout that has Donnacha Ryan's "imprint" all over it.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be a huge challenge for us," Scannell suggested.</p>
      <p>"Their scrummaging has been hugely dominant - even the front row that they're bringing on is making a big impact.</p>
      <p>"It's where I'm going to be focusing a lot of my energy, making sure we're fully prepped there".</p>
