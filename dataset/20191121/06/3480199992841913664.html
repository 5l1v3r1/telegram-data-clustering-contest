      <p>The historic steam attraction is inviting people to join the illuminated adventure Steam in Lights next weekend and into December for the first time.</p>
      <p>The 90-minute event features magical creatures, sparkling lights and snowfall as the dark nights are lit up by an array of colour.</p>
      <p>It starts at Bridgnorth where visitors follow an illuminated path down to the station and through a tunnel of lights to the platform, where hot food and drinks will be on sale.</p>

      <p>The train then lights up to welcome passengers aboard as a narrator guides passengers on their quest to find the ‘Christmas Cacklers.’</p>
      <p>Lewis Maddox, Severn Valley Railway events co-ordinator, said: “This is set to be a truly spectacular experience.</p>
      <p>"We have never done anything like it before and are extremely excited to offer it to our passengers this Christmas.</p>
