      <h2>The contrast with the rest of the season, when his Dublin ladies play in front of empty stands, irks him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/pat-nolan/" target="_blank">Pat Nolan</a></address>
      <p>Mick Bohan says he’s grown weary of landmark crowds on All-Ireland ladies final day.</p>
      <p>It’s the contrast with the rest of the season, when his Dublin ladies team play in front of empty stands, that irks him.</p>
      <p>When they completed the three-in-a-row against Galway earlier this year, a crowd of 56,114 turned out, making it the second most watched ladies sporting event in the world this year after soccer’s World Cup final, which drew 57,900.</p>
      <p>Year-on-year, the crowds have ramped up on finals day but the growth hasn’t been nearly as prevalent outside of that.</p>
      <p>“I’m actually getting tired of this record crowd number, that’s something that has begun to grate on me,” said the Dublin boss.</p>
      <p>“Because it’s one day. The whole success in this is that this becomes part of our culture. My sport is Gaelic games, it doesn’t really matter to me whether it’s a male or a female.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been lucky enough to be involved with both and thoroughly enjoyed my time with both groups. But 95% of the time, these girls play in front of empty stadiums.”</p>
      <p>The key to changing that, he feels, is more double headers with the men’s team.</p>
      <p>“The best atmosphere game that I’ve been involved with the last couple of years with the girls was in Castlebar.</p>
      <p>“We played Mayo in Castlebar before the lads played Mayo, I think it was two years ago. And there had to have been 7,000 or 8,000 at half-time - for a girls’ National League game?</p>

      <p>“Those one-day pull-offs of 56,000, it’s great, but I’d see it as a much bigger success if seven or eight times during the year you played in front of 8,000 or 10,000 than one day where you play in front of 56,000.”</p>
      <p>During Liam O’Neill’s GAA presidency from 2012-15, sponsorship was pooled in some instances between the GAA, Ladies Gaelic Football Association and the Camogie Association, with O’Neill advocating that all three bodies come under the one umbrella in time.</p>
      <p>It hasn’t happened yet.</p>
      <p>“My feeling is it’ll never be a full success until that happens,” Bohan insisted.</p>
      <p>“It’s a little bit like, at the moment in our game, there’s still a provincial system and we don’t even have any teams in our province this year and we’re still involved in a provincial system.</p>
      <p>“Why is that? Is it because it’s the right thing for the game or because people don’t want to let go of their positions? And I think I’d be very clear on the answer to that.</p>
      <p>“I think equally the same situation exists between camogie, LGFA and the GAA. What’s the right thing to happen? Without a doubt, to go under the one umbrella.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I played underage rugby for Clontarf. I still remember, on a Saturday, one of the big drawing points to play rugby for Clontarf was the amount of girls that came to watch the game.</p>
      <p>“It has only changed in the last decade that it has become a really popular thing for girls to come and watch fellas’ games. Now, it needs to become very popular for girls to go and watch girls because that’s still a factor that has to change.</p>
      <p>“A lot of girls will go and watch guys’ games but they need to start going to watch girls’ games as well.”</p>
