      <h1>21-year-old protester shot in Sai Wan Ho leaves hospital, haul of snacks in tow</h1>

      <p>A 21-year-old protester who was shot in the abdomen by a police officer last week has finally been discharged from hospital — and will apparently be taking home a major haul of sweet treats from well-wishers.</p>
      <p>According to a Facebook post by pro-democracy lawmaker Ray Chan, the shooting victim, surnamed Chow, was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/slowbeat/posts/10156383573957553">discharged on Wednesday</a>, and is currently recovering at home.</p>
      <p>Chan has been posting regular updates on Chow’s situation as they’re both alumni of the Salesian School. Amid the posts on Chow’s condition, one recent update noted that Chow was craving Lotte’s Koala March cookies — the bite-sized, chocolate-filled, koala-shaped snacks beloved by many in Hong Kong.</p>

      <p>Well, it would appear he got his wish.</p>
      <p>Chan later posted another update saying a Hongkonger based in Japan had heard Chow’s plea and sent in a veritable boatload of the treats in assorted flavors to aid in the protester’s recovery, while <i>Mingpao</i> reports that other well-wishers had even <a href="https://news.mingpao.com/ins/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/article/20191120/s00001/1574243040173/%E8%A5%BF%E7%81%A3%E6%B2%B321%E6%AD%B2%E4%B8%AD%E6%A7%8D%E9%9D%92%E5%B9%B4%E5%87%BA%E9%99%A2-%E7%B4%85%E7%99%BD%E8%97%8D%E8%A2%8B%E5%B8%B6%E8%B5%B0%E5%B8%82%E6%B0%91%E6%89%80%E9%80%81%E5%A4%A7%E9%87%8F%E7%86%8A%E4%BB%94%E9%A4%85">left scads of cookies outside the hospital</a>.</p>
      <p>The cookies from the supporter in Japan came with a note thanking Chow for standing up for Hong Kong — and warning him not to “eat it all at once.”</p>

      <p><i>Apple Daily</i> reports that Chow is a <a href="https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/20191121/B2GJDNGCBKFDLR2I7YFGU4XD3Q/">student at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education</a>.</p>
      <p>He was among a number of people who turned up at a flash protest in Sai Wan Ho on Nov. 11 as protesters shifted their strategy to focus on weekday unrest. During the protest, he was <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/protester-shot-in-sai-wan-ho-clashes-in-critical-condition/">shot at point blank range by a traffic cop</a>, prompting a widespread outcry against the use of potentially deadly force on a clearly unarmed protester. He was taken to hospital and needed to have surgery on his kidney and liver.</p>
      <p>He and another man, surnamed Hu, who was arrested at the same time, have been formally charged with taking part in an illegal assembly.</p>
      <p>Both men are being represented by lawyer and former lawmaker Andrew Cheng, who confirmed that Chow had to have his right kidney and part of his liver removed. He said that during a recent visit at the hospital, Chow was in good spirits, but hadn’t completely healed and could only speak in a whisper.</p>
      <p>He added that Chow would have to report to the police station next month.</p>
