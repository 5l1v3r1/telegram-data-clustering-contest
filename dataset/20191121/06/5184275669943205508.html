      <h1>Marjaavaan Box Office Day 6: Stays Over The 3 Crore Mark Yet Again</h1>
      <h2>There is good hold all through the week when compared with the opening day of 7.03 crores</h2>

      <p>It was yet another good day for <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/box-office-reviews/marjaavaan-box-office-review-riteish-deshmukhs-performance-sidharth-malhotras-punches-arent-enough-to-make-it-a-hit/"><i>Marjaavaan</i> </a>as the Sidharth Malhotra-Tara Sutaria-Riteish Deshmukh starrer stayed over the <b>3 crores</b> mark. There is good hold all through the week when compared with the opening day of <b>7.03 crores</b> and if today also the collections are sustained in the same range, one can expect reasonable numbers tomorrow as well as the film enters the second week.</p>

      <p>With Wednesday collections turning out to be <b>3.16 crores</b>, the film now stands at <b>35.34 crores</b>. The first week should close around the <b>38 crores</b> mark and from there its journey towards the <b>50 crores</b> milestone would begin.</p>
      <p>Sidharth Malhotra would now be super excited for the release of his next film, <i>Shershaah.</i> That one is a Karan Johar production no less and is a biggie. It carries good potential to cater to class as well as mass audience and once the promo is out, the target would be set for the filmâ€™s box office performance.</p>
      <p>Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources</p>
