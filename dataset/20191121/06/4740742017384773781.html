      <h1>UK weather: Cold weather to continue as wind chill of -10 and snow expected</h1>
      <h2>More extreme weather on the way</h2>

      <p>Britain is facing a brutal snow storm which could be set to batter the UK along with sub-zero chills, according to forecasters.</p>
      <p>The latest maps from Netweather TV show Britain could face snow storms and biting temperatures at the beginning of December.</p>
      <p>It's also predicted that the average wind chill will be -10C across the whole of the UK.</p>
      <p>London and the south west coast will also suffer the effects of the freezing temperatures, according to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> maps from WXCharts for the same period.</p>
      <p>Wind speed will peak at 30mph, according to WXCharts, and snow depth could be up to 25cm in Inverness and Cardiff on December 6, reports <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/weather/1207079/UK-snow-warning-met-office-latest-snow-storms-map">the Express.</a></p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Manchester, Newcastle and Liverpool snow depth will be between 5-10cm.</p>
      <p>The December weather charts come as Britain has been battered by a deadly polar blast.</p>
      <p>Across the UK November has been an average of 0.9C below the long-term average.</p>
      <p>Last week, Bristol saw a flurry on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/uk-weather-arctic-blast-see-3548277">snow fall on Thursday morning</a> followed by a series of icy mornings.</p>
      <p>Today (Thursday) should offer people a welcomed respite from the cold snap when much of the country will be cloudy.</p>
      <p>But it will still be cold with lows of 4C in the Midlands and Wales.</p>
      <p>In Bristol, temperatures will stay around 6C or 7C throughout the day but the nasty wind chill will make it feel more like 3C or 4C.</p>
      <p>It will be warmest on the south coast, with Camborne in Cornwall set to bask in 10C temperatures, although light rain is likely to dampen spirits.</p>

      <p>The recent colder temperatures have sparked a warning from medics.</p>
      <p>Dr Emer OConnell, Consultant in Public Health at Public Health England, said: "Older people and those with heart and lung problems are at risk of getting sick in cold weather.</p>
      <p>"Keep an eye out for those who may need help staying warm, ensure they wear lots of thin layers and have everything they need.</p>
      <p>"Below 18 degrees, changes to the body mean that the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increase so heating homes to this temperature is particularly important to stay well."</p>
