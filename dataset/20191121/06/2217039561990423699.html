        <b>GEORGIA : A 16-year-old high school student was arrested on suspicion of planning to attack black people at a predominantly African-American church in the south-eastern US state of Georgia, police said on Tuesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The teenager, described by police as a white female, detailed her plan to commit murder at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in a notebook that was found by fellow students who alerted school authorities, police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The teen, who police did not identify, was charged with criminal attempt to commit murder and sent to a youth detention centre in Georgia.</p>
      <p>Gainesville Police Department officials said the investigation indicated that the teenager was targeting the church based on the racial demographic of its members.</p>
      <p>"This is an active investigation and a prime example of how strong relationships between the student body, school administration, and law enforcement can intercept a potentially horrific incident," Police Chief Jay Parrish said in the statement.</p>
      <h3>CHARLESTON ATTACK</h3>
      <p>A 2015 attack on a church in Charleston "does appear to have played some type of role in this," the New York Times quoted a police officer, Sergeant Kevin Holbrook, as saying.</p>
      <p>A self-avowed white supremacist, Dylann Roof, went to a Bible study session at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on June 17, 2015. There he killed nine African-American church members with a .45-calibre Glock semi-automatic pistol.</p>
      <p>The Georgia teen had assembled a collection of butcher knives and other straight-edged weapons and she had visited the church once when no one was present, the Times reported.</p>
      <p>A representative of the Gainesville police was not immediately available for comment. - REUTERS</p>
