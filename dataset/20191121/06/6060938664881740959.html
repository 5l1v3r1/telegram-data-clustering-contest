      <h1>Sanjay Leela Bhansali to tweak ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’ for Alia Bhatt?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:18:48+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:18</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s next, ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’ starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Alia-Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a> in the lead, is undoubtedly one of the highly anticipated films of 2020. We are all aware that Alia will play the role of one of the most powerful, loved and respected madams of Mumbai’s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kamathipura">Kamathipura</a> brothel during the 1960s.</p>
      <p>Based on a book ‘Queens of Mumbai’, that chronicles the lives of sex workers, the film will reportedly focus on Gangubai who was one of the most influential madams in the city, with notorious criminals serving as her clients. According to a report on Mumbai Mirror, the filmmaker, who has a penchant for cinematically glamorous films, will reportedly water down the original grim story for Alia, to give it more of a glossed over version.</p>
      <p>The report goes to say that Alia’s role as a sex worker may just be “whitewashed” in this upcoming film adaptation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, reports doing the rounds also hit at Ajay Devgn joining the project to play an intense character of a gangster with a golden heart, who teaches Gangubai the ropes and in turn, falls in love with her.</p>
      <p>Bhansali is expected to commence filming of the biopic this year, well in time for its release of 11th September 2020.</p>
