      <h1>Poundland unveils its lowest prices ever ‘in time for Christmas’</h1>
      <h2>A nationwide move at bargain prices</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shashana Brown</a></address>
      <p>Every Poundland store nationwide will offer products above and below £1 - at a limited number of simple price points from 50p to £5.</p>
      <p>The nationwide move was brought in on Wednesday, November 20 and comes after a successful trial in 24 West Midlands stores.</p>
      <p>The bargain chain says this means shoppers across the UK can now enjoy more choice, more brands and amazing value on the products they love.</p>
      <p>Poundland bosses say a broader range of items at simple prices are now available in three key categories - household goods, health and beauty and grocery.</p>
      <p>Barry Williams, Poundland managing director said: “We’ve introduced simple pricing in time for Christmas so we can offer customers even more choices and even better value for money.</p>
      <p>“Our shoppers love the amazing value we provide and now we can begin bringing that value on wider ranges that they now can find in stores for the first time.</p>
      <p>“Our team of talented buyers has moved heaven and earth to bring these ranges to store in time for Christmas and I’d like to thank them for all their hard work.”</p>
      <p>The strategy compliments several new customer-led initiatives over the past year including the introduction the launch of PEP&amp;CO family fashion ‘shop-in-shops’ and its pilot of fresh and frozen ranges in five stores across Yorkshire and Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Customers will be able to bag a bargain on items such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Matchmakers for 75p (£1.75 Sainsburys)</li>
        <li>Walkers 24 packs of crisps for £3 (£4 Sainsburys)</li>
        <li>L’Oréal Elvive Fibrology shampoo for £2 (£2.49 Boots; £2.75 Asda)</li>
        <li>Comfort Blue Skies fabric conditioner for £4 (£8 in Wilko)</li>
        <li>Nivea Men Fresh Power 0% deodorant for £1.50 (£3 Sainsburys)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the new simple price structure applies to selected lines, three quarters of products will continue to sell at Poundland’s core £1 price point.</p>
