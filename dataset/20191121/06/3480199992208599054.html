      <p>Thanks to a partnership between the British Film Institute (BFI) and rural cinema scheme Flicks in the Sticks, a special film screening of cult classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory will take place in the landmark building that continues to undergo extensive renovation.</p>
      <p>The screening, for people aged between 16 to 30, is on Tuesday and is part of a scheme to engage young people with film by delivering high quality screened events to new groups of people, in new and unexpected locations.</p>
      <p>The renovation of the Flaxmill has been driven by the desire to bring the building back to life at the heart of the community.</p>
      <p>Event organiser, Arts Alive’s cultural co-ordinator Jo Davies said: “I am excited to be involved in this project funded by the BFI.</p>
      <p>"It’s great to be organising a film screening for young people, like myself, in my hometown of Shrewsbury.</p>
      <p>"So come along and indulge your inner child, there'll be board games and sweet treats from 6pm.”</p>
      <p>The screening starts at 7.30pm and tickets, which cost £6 can be booked at Flaxmill Maltings, Shrewsbury or by calling 07972 839625.</p>
      <p>Tickets also available at <a href="https://www.artsalive.co.uk/">www.artsalive.co.uk</a></p>
