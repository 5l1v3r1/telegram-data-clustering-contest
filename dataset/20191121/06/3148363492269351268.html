      <h1>WATCH: Andrew Yang Rips MSNBC for Lack of Speaking Time | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>EAST POINT, Georgia — Businessman Andrew Yang criticized MSNBC sharply for not giving him adequate speaking time during Wednesday night’s Democrat debate, co-hosted by the left-wing network and the Washington Post.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:27:55+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:27</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak, Joel B. Pollak</a></address>
      <p>“What is up with that?” Yang asked Breitbart News. “You should ask MSNBC.”</p>
      <p>ABC News computed that Yang only spoke for six minutes and fifty-nine seconds across the two hours of debate — barely 5% of the total time on a stage with 10 candidates.</p>

      <p>CNN calculated that Yang spoke for even less time, prompting the campaign of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) to post a tweet in his defense.</p>

      <p>“The numbers speak for themselves,” Yang told Breitbart.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t the first time that people have had this kind of issue with this particular network.”</p>
      <p>Yang has remained among the frontrunners despite being marginalized by many mainstream media outlets. He had the second-largest contingent of supporters outside the debate venue, the Tyler Perry Studios — second only to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is in fourth place nationwide but leads, according to some polls, in Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
