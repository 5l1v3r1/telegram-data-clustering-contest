        <b>- Some senators are not happy with the impression that they are responsible for the failed N1 trillion constituency projects in the last 10 years</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- PDP senators at the National Assembly asked President Muhammadu Buhari to question his ministers over the failed projects</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- The senators believe the president must have been misinformed over the status of the constituency projects across the country</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senate caucus on Wednesday, November 20, directed President Muhammadu Buhari to his ministers and agencies saying these are those to hold accountable for the alleged failed N1 trillion constituency projects.</p>
      <p>President Buhari had recently <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277101-buhari-stunning-revelation-nigerians-benefit-n1trn-constituency-projects.html">claimed that the amount was pumped into constituency projects</a> in the last 10 years with nothing to show for it.</p>
      <p>Reacting on Wednesday, November 20, the Senate caucus, through the minority leader, Eyinnaya Abaribe, said the body was very certain that the president may have been given fake information by his speech writers as the lawmakers are not responsible for the execution of constituency projects.</p>

        <i>"We have always said that constituency projects aren’t done by the senators or members of the House of Representatives. They are domiciled in the executive who executes it.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"And so, if the president says that he hasn’t seen anything, he should ask his ministers and his agencies under him as the executive because they are the people who have been executing these projects,"</i> Abaribe said.</p>
      <p>On his part, Godiya Akwashiki, spokesperson of the Senate, said an official response would only be given if the president, who he called the 'chief executive officer of Nigeria', writes officially to the National Assembly on the matter.</p>

      <p><i>"He spoke as chief executive but you people ( journalists) sometimes you can be funny. He has a mode of communication and I want to believe if he has anything, he will just write to us, he will,"</i> he said.</p>
