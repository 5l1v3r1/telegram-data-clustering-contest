          <b>About 20 postmen gather beneath a tinsel tree to promote their upcoming efforts of collecting letters to Santa during the 1961 Oklahoma City Christmas parade. This photo was published in The Daily Oklahoman on Nov. 21, 1961, still two days before Thanksgiving that year. The letter carriers would be toting their mailbags as they walked the parade route, allowing young onlookers to mail their wishes to St. Nick. [MANDELL MATHESON/THE OKLAHOMAN ARCHIVES]</b>
