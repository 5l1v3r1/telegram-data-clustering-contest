      <p>A barrister can represent criminals at the same time as acting as a police informer, a Victorian detective has told a royal commission into the Lawyer X scandal.</p>
      <p>While being grilled about the force's use of lawyer Nicola Gobbo to inform on her gangland clients, Detective Stuart Bateson revealed he did not believe the two roles were incompatible.</p>
      <p>"I think you can do two things," he told counsel assisting the commission, Chris Winneke QC, on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Would this ever happen again? Clearly not. But my view is you can be a human source and a barrister at the same time."</p>
      <p>Mr Bateson was being questioned about Ms Gobbo representing an accused murderer in a gangland killing, after helping turn a hitman-turned-informer into a prosecution witness for the same case in 2004.</p>
      <p>This prompted Commissioner Margaret McMurdo to ask: "Can you be a human source and a barrister acting for someone, when you've also acted for the key witness against that person?"</p>
      <p>"Well that, Your Honour, is, I guess, where I feel it's a bit murky," Mr Bateson replied.</p>
      <p>He said Ms Gobbo had told the court she had acted for a witness in the case and the Office of Public Prosecutions, if not the judge, knew.</p>
      <p>Mr Winneke put to the detective that everyone, crook or not, was entitled to an independent legal practitioner.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure that we agree on the independent. What I would say is that they have absolute right to seek legal counsel," Mr Bateson said.</p>
      <p>He also refused suggestions he withheld vital information about Ms Gobbo's influence in the case at the time.</p>
      <p>The detective said he had destroyed evidence, which now appears to have turned up in an electronic cache.</p>
      <p>According to the detective, the unsigned and draft statement from the hitman-turned-informer was destroyed after the man altered his statement about whether the murder was planned.</p>
      <p>The man's story - which implicated other crooks including prolific gangland killer Carl Williams - changed after his lawyer, Ms Gobbo, labelled it "ridiculous".</p>
      <p>But police lawyer Renee Enbom on Thursday revealed a copy of the draft appeared to have turned up in documents emailed to her following Mr Bateson's evidence.</p>
      <p>"It appears ... that it might be the electronic version of the printed document that Mr Bateson said in evidence yesterday that he secured and destroyed," Ms Enbom told the commission.</p>
      <p>Mr Bateson was questioned for hours about the document.</p>
      <p>"If the situation is, Ms Gobbo's involvement is being filtered out of this and defence counsel are not getting the full picture, that is a most unfortunate circumstance for the presentation and for the person who's trying to get to the truth to get through the spin," Chris Winneke QC said.</p>
      <p>The officer replied it was a "balancing act" and he had taken necessary steps to protect Mr Gobbo's safety.</p>
      <p>Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton and his predecessors, Simon Overland and Christine Nixon, are expected to front the inquiry.</p>
