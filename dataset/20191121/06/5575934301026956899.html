      <p>Victoria on Thursday issued its first Code Red fire warning in nearly a decade as devastating bushfires in Australia continue to spread across states.</p>
      <p>Country Fire Authority Victoria (<a href="https://news.cfa.vic.gov.au/-/total-fire-ban-for-the-whole-state-of-victoria">CFA VIC</a>) implemented a total fire ban for the entire state of Victoria on Thursday and also issued a Code Red Fire Danger Rating in the Mallee and Northern Country Districts.

      <p><a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDV21037.shtml">The Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology</a> also issued a severe weather warning in parts of Victoria and warned of damaging winds in the region.</p>
      <p>Several areas in Melbourne surpassed the state’s all-time November record of 40.9 degrees set in 1894. According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/BOM_Vic/status/1197381903604731904">Bureau of Meteorology Victoria</a>, the highest temperature in Victoria hit 42.4 degrees.</p>
      <p>Bushfires spread across state lines. According to The Guardian, there were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/nov/21/south-australia-fires-nsw-bushfires-victoria-vic-qld-queensland-sa-emergency-warning-code-red-weather-thunderstorm-dust-asthma-live-latest-updates">still 50 fires burning</a> in New South Wales alone as of 4 p.m. AEST on Thursday.</p>

      <p>33 people were injured in South Australia on Wednesday. The town of Yorketown in South Australia <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/sa-fires-yorke-peninsula-edithburgh-yorketown-cfs-evacuated-bushfire-updates/643c1477-18c9-4a0c-a3db-8d167f390db5">was evacuated on Thursday</a> due to a blaze nearby.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/photos-videos-sydney-blanket-of-smoke-bushfires-2019-11">Sydney has been blanketed with a thick grey cloud</a> of smoke from bushfires raging hundreds of kilometers away.</p>
      <p>The heavy smoke made Sydney the <a href="https://www.airvisual.com/world-air-quality-ranking">16th worst city in the world for air quality</a> on Thursday, behind global hubs with notoriously bad air quality like Delhi, Mumbai, and Beijing.</p>
      <p>Though bushfires are a common occurrence during Aussie summers, scientists have said that Australia’s fire season is beginning earlier and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/climate-change-nsw-fires-2019-11">becoming more extreme as a result of climate change.</a></p>
