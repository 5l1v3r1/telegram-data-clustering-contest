      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:28:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>There’s a cloud still hanging over SarkCess Music over the reported exit of Akwaboah.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, it was reported of the exit of Ghanaian Highlife singer, Gladstorm Kwabena Akwaboah Jnr, popularly known as Akwaboah from. Sarkcess Music.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the ‘Hye Me Bo’ singer<a href="https://www.ghbase.com/akwaboah-reportedly-leaves-sarkcess-music-signs-a-new-deal-with-a-multi-million-record-label/"> has left Sarkodie’s record label and signed a contract with a multi-million record label.</a></p>
      <p>The name of the record we were told is OB Empire Music, a multi-million new record label owned by one Oheneba.</p>
      <p>Well, speaking on the said issue on YFm, Akwaboah stated that there’s nothing like that but his demeanour showed he had something to hide.</p>
      <p>The interviewer who had information about his exit asked that he has heard the big announcement will be made on stage at the upcoming Rapperholic Concert.</p>
      <p>Akwaboah who looked reluctant to answer nodded that maybe that will be the case on the night of the Rapperholic Concert because it wouldn’t be a bad idea.</p>
      <p>Akwaboah also noted that his 3-year contract with the label will soon expire and that there have been advance talks over the contract but a decision will soon be made.</p>
