      <p>The late Paul Walker's character Brian O'Connor is reportedly retuning to The Fast and the Furious franchise.<br/><br/>The star was killed at the age of just 40 in 2013, when the Porsche Carrera GT he was a passenger in spun out of control, crashing into two trees and exploding in a fireball. The vehicle was driven by his friend Roger Rodas, who also died in the accident.<br/><br/>Walker starred alongside Vin Diesel as then-undercover-cop Brian O'Connor in 2001's The Fast and the Furious, and reprised the role in several instalments before his tragic death. His final appearance was 2015's Furious 7.<br/><br/>However, according to entertainment reporter Daniel Richtman, Brian is set to return to screens in 2020's Fast &amp; Furious 9 - although it remains unclear whether a new actor will portray the role or whether archive footage will be used.<br/><br/>"Just got a new casting grid for something and with it some big news that are sure to be controversial," he tweeted earlier this month. "Not sure how I feel about it myself but we'll see."<br/><br/>He later shared the tweet again, this time revealing the news: "It's been long enough. They are bringing back Paul Walker's character, Brian, to FF9."<br/><br/>Bosses at Universal, the studio behind the movie, are yet to address the claims.<br/><br/>Fast &amp; Furious 9, starring Vin Diesel and John Cena, debuts in cinemas May 22.</p>
