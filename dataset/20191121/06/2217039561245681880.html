        <b>Holland's hat-trick hero and stand-in captain Georginio Wijnaldum made it a point to make his views known about racism in football after opening the scoring in a 5-0 Group C Euro 2020 qualifier against Estonia yesterday morning (Singapore time).</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wijnaldum, who stood alongside teammate Frenkie de Jong in the celebration of his first goal, held their arms out and pointed to the colours of their skin.</p>
      <p>It follows allegations of racist abuse aimed at Dutch second-tier player Ahmad Mendes Moreira during a game between his side SBV Excelsior and Den Bosch last weekend.</p>
      <p>Wijnaldum had spoken about the incident in the build-up to the match and tweeted an anti-racism message after the fixture.</p>
      <p>Dutch coach Ronald Koeman welcomed the gesture, saying: "Gini just said something about it in the dressing room during our closing words with each other.</p>
      <p>"He said he feels so happy with this Dutch team, where this problem (of racism) does not occur. It is one team. It's nice to see that."</p>
      <p>Koeman had plenty of reasons to be happy yesterday with debutants Calvin Stengs, 20, and Myron Boadu, 18, grabbing two assists and a goal respectively. Defender Nathan Ake, 24, scored Holland's other goal.</p>
      <p>"It would be very strange if everything was clear against Estonia," Koeman told Dutch broadcaster NOS.</p>
      <p>"We still have six months. We have a lot of young players who will be half a year older. It will be a fight."</p>
      <p>Koeman added that next March's international window would heavily influence the make-up of his Euro 2020 squad. - REUTERS</p>
