      <p>On June 6, 1980, Maxine Fullerton, a 54-year-old laundress at the Helena State Training School for Boys, was found dead in the basement of the laundry room.</p>
      <p>A mother of five who enjoyed her grandchildren and studying genealogy, Fullerton was murdered by a teenage boy serving time at the school for attempted rape.</p>
      <p>Fullerton was knocked backward out of her sewing chair, raped and stabbed with scissors 28 times in the chest and neck. Her killer is serving a life sentence.</p>
      <p>When her mother was murdered, daughter Robbie Fullerton was 23 and working as a parole officer. A career in criminal justice led to work as a victims services coordinator for the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.</p>
      <p>Fullerton has also served on the Pardon and Parole Board.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the five-member board voted to recommend commutation for hundreds of people through an accelerated, single-stage docket that was brought about through House Bill 1269. The new law made retroactive criminal justice reforms that reclassified simple drug possession and some property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies.</p>
      <p>In Oklahoma, the governor may approve or deny the board's recommendations. More than 450 people were released from Oklahoma prisons.</p>
      <p>The mass release captured national attention and was lauded by those in criminal justice reform as a sharp turn in the right direction for the traditionally “tough on crime” Sooner State.</p>
      <p>As some celebrate, Fullerton urges caution.</p>
      <p>“It was rushing, it was accelerated, with hundreds and hundreds on the docket,” she said. “The commutation docket, in the past, is a two-stage process, with in-depth investigations, talking to the families, friends and investigators, and it’s a time-consuming process. At that time it took months. Now the numbers have quadrupled and the time is less because of the rush. It's terrifying.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘A massive effort’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not all inmates who were eligible for commutation were released. Some had detainers or a consecutive sentence. Others were denied because they had serious conduct violations in prison, a registered victim is on file or a district attorney filed a protest.</p>
      <p>Steven Bickley, executive director of the Pardon and Parole Board, told The Oklahoman the commutation process was thorough, with staff making recommendations and the board examining each case.</p>
      <p>Board members communicated with district attorneys across the state, to determine how much of a risk an inmate was to the public, Bickley said. For checks and balances, the Department of Corrections looked over each case for potential data errors, he said.</p>
      <p>“This was a massive effort and undertaking,” Bickley said. “The problem is there is some criminality here. These people aren’t angels, but most of the ones the district attorneys were objecting to also failed on the conduct test. That's a hard thing for us — when it comes to drugs — some people are addicts and some are in the business of drugs and you don't know that by ‘simple possession.’”</p>
      <p>In fiscal 2018 while on the Pardon and Parole Board, Fullerton voted on 429 parole cases — 323 nonviolent and 106 violent. In the nonviolent cases, she voted in favor 22.7% of the time. In the violent cases, she voted in favor 10.4%.</p>
      <p>Fullerton was the toughest board member, having cast the fewest favorable votes among her colleagues.</p>
      <p>“I always took them case by case, did all the studying and voted my conscience,” Fullerton said. “Some were for violent people, and some were not.”</p>
      <p>Fullerton is skeptical that elected leaders and criminal justice reform advocates can ensure public safety after a mass release of convicts.</p>
      <p>“The Department of Corrections is notorious for getting people out because they’ve got to have the beds,” she said. “They're going to put everybody on that list they can think of and the Pardon and Parole Board says 'yes' or 'no' on very little information. Why?”</p>
      <p>Officials have offered assurances that the released inmates were connected with community resources to help them succeed on the streets. Those resources included transitional housing, mental health and substance abuse programs presented during transition fairs inside state prisons.</p>
      <p>“I have never seen that amount of energy and activity around these transition fairs prerelease,” said Kris Steele, executive director of Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform. “In every facility that a person was being commuted, there was a transition fair and at least 20 nonprofits and providers and housing facilities participated in those transition fairs.”</p>
      <p>Steele, who also previously served on the Pardon and Parole Board, said the “the vast majority” of the individuals whose sentences were commuted were most recently serving time for simple drug possession and they were in prison because of their addictions.</p>
      <p>“I believe addiction, as most Oklahomans believe, is a health issue,” he said. “It’s a disease and people who battle addiction should be treated as patients, not prisoners. I strongly take the position that these individuals should not have been incarcerated in the first place.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Every crime is violent’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fullerton has been busy looking at the past criminal behavior of those who recently had their drug possession sentences commuted.</p>
      <p>Among a host of crimes, she’s found previous convictions for burglary, DUI, robbery or attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, and felon in possession of a firearm.</p>
      <p>“They may be nonviolent at this moment,” Fullerton said. “Does nonviolent mean this time or anything in the past? I would say the majority are not new to the criminal justice system, or felonies.”</p>
      <p>Bickley said the inmates had a release date scheduled, and every day they spent in prison meant more cost to taxpayers.</p>
      <p>As for past criminal cases, Bickley said, those were already discharged, with the inmates having previously served their time.</p>
      <p>“The fundamental concern people have is these are criminals but (the problem) is the only reason that they’re in jail is simple possession,” Bickley said. “So either society did not prove they committed another crime or they wanted a double jeopardy because of previous crimes. If you start picking and choosing you become arbitrary and you deny people the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, and they've paid their debt.”</p>
      <p>Bickley said the board took seriously the commutation process and understood the public’s concern over safety.</p>
      <p>“I worry just as much about did we keep some people in prison that should have gotten out,” he said. “This isn’t a Willie Horton situation where we’re letting murderers out. I haven't found a single decision that I would have changed. I’m sure there’s a chunk of people that are nervous and worried, but that’s criminal justice reform. We’re still the second in the nation in incarceration.”</p>
      <p>Fullerton said she wants criminal justice reformers to consider “victim justice reform,” as well.</p>
      <p>“A person’s own repeated criminal behavior tears families apart,” she said. “There are no victimless crimes. Every crime is violent. Every crime causes pain, heartache, hurt.”</p>
