      <p>Alicia Keys takes <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/2019-grammys-the-highs-and-lows.html">a rare trip away from the piano</a> for the music video of her new single “Time Machine.” Keys, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/grammys-2020-alicia-keys-host.html">who’s set to host the Grammys for the second year in a row on January 26</a>, dropped the old-school video Wednesday night after <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/2020-grammy-nominations-snubs-and-surprises.html">announcing the 2020 Grammy nominees</a> on Wednesday morning with Bebe Rexha and Gayle King. After such a jam-packed day, it’s fitting that Keys chose to end the day by releasing a smooth, old-school, throwback of a track like “Time Machine.” The music video, directed by Art Johnson and Keys’s brother Cole Cook, depicts Keys as a roller-rink attendant who ends up putting on skates and hitting the rink with her girlfriends. The whole thing is flirty and fun and even includes a well-acted cameo from rapper <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/best-music-videos-2018.html">Tierra Wack</a>. “Time Machine” is set to appear on Keys’s forthcoming seventh studio album.</p>
