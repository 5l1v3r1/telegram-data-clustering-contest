He also held the CFO role at Equion Energía, a Colombian joint venture between Talisman Energy and Ecopetrol. Ian will join the board of Gulf Keystone and assume the CFO role on 13 January, taking over from Sami Zouari, who will step down as CFO on 2 December. Zouari will assist Ian for a short handover period. Jaap Huijskes, chairman of the company, said:“Following a thorough search process, I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Ian Weatherdon as CFO.
