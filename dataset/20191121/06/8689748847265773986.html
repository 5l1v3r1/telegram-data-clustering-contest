      <p>Rapper Joey B has said he’s focused at making his personality in the music industry a formidable and enviable one, not one built on beefs.</p>
      <p>He told Ghanaweekend TV that unlike other artists who erect their brand on the foundation of beefs, he’s charting a different path altogether.</p>
      <p>When asked how he manages to stay away from beef, he replied, “That’s not the goal. The goal is to really push the music. Fine, you can push your music or your arts through beef but until when?” he quizzed.</p>
      <p>“I want to leave this thing with a clean sheet. With a very solid brand. With a very cool wave or music,” he added.</p>
      <p>He said making his people happy and giving back to the needy is paramount.</p>
      <p>“I just wanna make music and just make all my people happy and try and give back to the needy and do cool stuff. That’s me”.</p>
