      <p>The owner’s son was one of four people hurt and was taken to hospital in the island’s capital Palermo with serious injuries.</p>

      <p>Firefighters managed to extricate one employee who was inside the depot at the time of the explosion but were still searching for one of his colleagues who was reported missing.</p>
      <p>The local prosecutor’s office opened an enquiry into the disaster.</p>
      <p>Staff were preparing for New Year celebrations comprising traditional firework displays across the south of Italy designed to chase away evil spirits.</p>
      <p>Preparations for such displays, a tradition dating back to 1540, annually see a number of fatal incidents.</p>
