      <h1>Wolves Throwback Thursday: When Steve Bull and Andy Thompson debuted</h1>
      <h2>More than 1,000 appearances between them and 24 years of combined service, Steve Bull and Andy Thompson wrote their names into Wolves folklore.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>Bully, of course, is the club’s all-time top scorer with a whopping 306 goals from his 561 games.</p>
      <p>Speedy penalty-taker Thommo made 451 appearances from full-back.</p>
      <p>Snapped up for £65,000 from fierce rivals West Bromwich Albion – or the dark side, as Bull says – the pair proved to be such astute signings.</p>
      <p>But the start, for both of them, was pretty underwhelming.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow marks 33 years since Bull, wearing number eight, and Thompson, donning seven, pulled on gold and black for the first time.</p>
      <p>There was no debut goal for Bull or a clean sheet for Thompson, though.</p>
      <p>Instead, Wolves were downed 3-0 by Wrexham in front of 5,252 at Molineux – in Division Four.</p>
      <p>They had dreamed of a glorious bow, but this was the harsh reality at Wolves – slowly working their way back up following near-death under the Bhatti Brothers.</p>
      <p>And Thompson said: “It was a totally different place to play.</p>
      <p>“Losing 3-0 to Wrexham, it was a bit of a reality check.</p>
      <p>"It wasn’t a great time. The club had just come out of serious trouble after everything with the Bhatti Brothers.</p>
      <p>“It was just after the two draws with Chorley in the FA Cup – and just before the loss to them at Burnden Park – as well.</p>
      <p>“I just remember the change, coming over from West Brom where everything was done for you to Wolves where you had to wash your own kit.</p>
      <p>“You had to do it all yourself and I just thought, I’ve got to put my heart and soul into this – everything I have.”</p>
      <p>Thompson did just that – his commitment could never be questioned, and neither could Bull’s. And the pair soon helped turn things around for the better.</p>
      <p>“When me and Steve got to the club, we were in the bottom four – but we ended up getting to the play-offs,” said Thompson.</p>
      <p>“That’s testament to the work of Graham Turner and how he was with us.</p>
      <p>“We lost to Aldershot in the play-offs but we recovered and went up the next season, and up from Division Three the season after that.</p>
      <p>"Me and Steve loved our time at the club and we’re both so happy to be following the club, and all the success they have had, closely now.”</p>
      <p>Bull did not find the back of the net against Wrexham, but soon got the first of his 306 for Wolves – at Cardiff in a 1-0 Freight Rover Trophy win.</p>
      <p>He said on his debut: “It was a dismal day.</p>
      <p>“The pitch was terrible, and there was not many there, to be honest.</p>
      <p>“Coming from the other side, the dark side, the last thing me and Thommo wanted was to lose our first game 3-0.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t great but as soon as I got that first goal and people knew what Thommo was about, the fans took to us, and we never looked back.”</p>
      <p>Bull and Thompson are still regulars at Molineux with the former serving as a club ambassador and the latter as a radio pundit.</p>
      <p>“He’s still my best mate now. We’ve gone through everything with Wolves, and to see where the club is at now, it’s unbelievable,” added Bull.</p>
      <p>“And we’ll be a part of the club until we’re told not to be!”</p>
