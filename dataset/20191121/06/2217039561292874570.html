        <b>Traffic along Scotts Road was blocked off yesterday for about an hour after a tree in front of the Grand Hyatt Singapore fell after a heavy downpour.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident in the Orchard area occurred at around 3pm, with the tree falling on a car and obstructing four lanes of the road.</p>
      <p>The New Paper understands that the car driver was freed by passers-by. No one was hurt.</p>
      <p>In a video of the scene, passers-by and Grand Hyatt hotel staff can be seen helping to clear away the branches of the fallen tree.</p>
      <p>Both police and the Singapore Civil Defence Force were present at the scene.</p>

      <p>By 4pm, the car had been moved to the side of the road and two lanes were opened.</p>
      <p>The tree, which the National Parks Board (NParks) called a rain tree, was finally cleared by the board's contractors at 6pm.</p>
      <p>In 2017, heavy rain, strong winds and root issues led to a tembusu tree falling on a woman and killing her at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The tree was estimated to be about 270 years old.</p>
