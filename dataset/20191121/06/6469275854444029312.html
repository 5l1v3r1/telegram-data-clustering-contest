        <b>A woman has funded an ice making and dispensing machine for Rosemere Cancer Centre’s Ribblesdale Ward, through what she believes to be a good act of karma.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The money for the machine was donated to Rosemere Cancer Foundation by Valerie Bennett, from Home Information Searches Limited.</p>
      <p>Valerie had seen a post online by a young man whose friend was being treated on the ward and could have benefitted from some ice.</p>
      <p>Valerie, who lives in Whitworth, said: “The young man was distraught. He had gone out and bought a bucket of ice. He had set up a Just Giving page to fund a new machine but the donations weren’t coming in.</p>
      <p>“I contacted him and said I would see what I could do. I decided that through my company, Home Information Searches Limited, I would fund the machine.</p>
      <p>“We provide reports for solicitors on people buying and selling houses.</p>
      <p>“I believe that it’s karma, when someone is doing well it’s their duty to do good for others, which I believe sets up a circle of goodness.</p>
      <p>“Two days after I donated the money, I received a letter giving my PPI payments back. Like I say, it’s karma.”</p>
      <p>The charity already had an ice machine on order and were planning to fund it after the old one had broken and was unable to be repaired.</p>
      <p>Ribblesdale ward manager Danielle Jackson, who contacted the Preston-based charity for help, said: “Chemotherapy medicines can affect the cells in the taste buds, leaving some patients to complain of a metallic taste in their mouth.</p>
      <p>“Others find that it alters how their food tastes. In either case, sucking on ice cubes can help to numb the taste buds to alleviate both issues.</p>
      <p>“Radiotherapy, which is also used to treat some cancers, can cause a dry throat and mouth so again, sucking ice cubes and sipping chilled water can be helpful.</p>
      <p>“We are therefore very grateful to Valerie for buying this machine for us.”</p>
