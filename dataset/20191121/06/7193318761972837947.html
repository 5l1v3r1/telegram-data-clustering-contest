      <p>Thunder guard Dennis Schroder wound his way into the paint and abruptly pulled up to toss a floater over Lakers center Dwight Howard.</p>
      <p>The arc on his shot was perfectly calculated, rising just out of Howard’s reach before falling through the hoop.</p>
      <p>"Dennis was amazing,” point guard Chris Paul said after the Thunder’s 112-107 loss on Tuesday at Los Angeles. “Kept us in it all night."</p>
      <p>With a few minutes left in the third quarter, Schroder had already set a season-high with that floater. But he kept going to score 31 points. For the fourth time this season, Schroder led the team in points. He logged the Thunder’s first 30-point performance of the year.</p>
      <p>“We needed him,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. “He had 20 in the first half and gave us a good spark offensively because it was a night where we didn't really have it from behind the line. We didn't shoot it particularly well. I thought we had some pretty good looks that we probably needed to knock down that we just didn't knock down. But Dennis was an offensive spark for us and a bright spot."</p>
      <p>Other than Schroder and Danilo Gallinari, who added 25 points, the Thunder’s usual scorers struggled. Paul made just one field goal. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shot 5-of-16. Steven Adams took just three shots.</p>
      <p>With Schroder and center Nerlens Noel combining for 46 points, the Thunder bench outscored the Lakers bench 57-27.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Beat the odds’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paul might have been a thorn in LeBron James’ side Tuesday night, poking the ball out of his hands, swatting a pass, and guarding him like a corner back on a breakaway to record four steals in the Thunder’s loss to the Lakers.</p>
      <p>But on Wednesday, Paul took to Twitter to congratulate his longtime friend on the milestone he reached with the 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists he recorded against the Thunder.</p>
      <p>“Congrats my brother on being the FIRST player in NBA history to record a triple double against every team... and to do it in year 17 too!” read a post on Paul’s verified Twitter account. “Continue to beat the odds.”</p>
      <p>Rockets guard Russell Westbrook came an assist short of the same accomplishment on Oct. 28, when he logged 21 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists against the Thunder. It was Westbrook's first time facing the team he spent 11 seasons of his NBA career with. The Thunder next faces the Rockets on Jan. 9, in Westbrook’s nationally televised return to OKC.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Adams’s minutes reduced</b>
      </p>
      <p>Noel was the Thunder's closing center Tuesday night. Starting center Steven Adams sat on the bench.</p>
      <p>"Obviously we're dealing with Steven's knee still," Donovan said of the decision. "I don't want to say he's on a minutes restriction, but we're trying to be mindful and keep him in a range."</p>
      <p>It wasn't obvious that Adams' left knee was still an issue. A left knee contusion forced Adams to sit three games: Oct. 30, Nov. 2 and Nov. 10. But Adams, including Tuesday, has started OKC's last four games.</p>
      <p>He played 27 minutes against the Clippers on Monday, and 24 minutes against the Lakers on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Adams is averaging 26.3 minutes per game, down from 33.4 minutes last season. His scoring has dropped from 13.9 points per game to 7.8 points per game. Adams, a career 58.6 percent shooter, is shooting 50.6 percent from the floor this season.</p>
