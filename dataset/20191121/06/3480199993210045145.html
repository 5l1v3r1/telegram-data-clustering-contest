      <p>The director of Crazy Rich Asians has denied an actress’ claim she was overlooked for the film because she was not “Asian enough”.</p>
      <p>The comedy-drama was a critical and commercial success on its release last year and was praised for being the first major Hollywood production to feature a majority Asian cast since 1993’s The Joy Luck Club.</p>
      <p>However, former Disney Channel star Brenda Song, who is of Thai descent, said she tried to get an audition but missed out because of her appearance.</p>

      <p>The 31-year-old told Teen Vogue: “Their reasoning behind that, what they said was that my image was basically not Asian enough, in not so many words. It broke my heart.</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘This character is in her late to mid-20s, an Asian American, and I can’t even audition for it? I’ve auditioned for Caucasian roles my entire career, but this specific role, you’re not going to let me do it?”</p>
      <p>Song, known for TV roles including The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody, added: “You’re going to fault me for having worked my whole life?’ I was like, ‘Where do I fit?'”</p>
      <p>Crazy Rich Asians director Jon Chu has now denied he barred Song from auditioning because of her race.</p>

      <p>He tweeted: “Would these words ever come out of my mouth? Nope makes no sense. I feel horrible she thinks this is the reason. The fact is I love Brenda Song and am a fan.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t need her to audition because I already knew who she was!”</p>
      <p>Crazy Rich Asians starred Constance Wu and Henry Golding and surpassed expectations at the box office, grossing $238 million (£184 million) worldwide.</p>
      <p>A sequel is in development.</p>
