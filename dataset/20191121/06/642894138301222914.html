      <p>Far South Networks, in association with Hambisana, have together successfully met the telephony requirements of Gagasi FM.</p>
      <p>Gagasi FM uses the Com.X10 to provide clear and reliable communication for its growing listenership, broadcasting local and international music in Durban and surrounding areas in KwaZulu- Natal.</p>
      <p>“Hambisana is a leader in IT support and outsourcing, broadcast monitoring solutions and the provision of managed services,” says Grant Broomhall, MD of Far South Networks. As a skilled and certified solution provider, it implemented the Com.X10 PBX for its customer, Gagasi FM.</p>
      <p>Gagasi FM’s existing Telos VX unit supports basic PBX features but has limited SIP accounts, thus making it difficult to integrate it into the main office telephone service. In addition, a VOIP gateway would be required to provide interconnects to both Telkom and Satellite broadband services, which are utilised for redundancy.</p>

      <p>The decision was made to consolidate the existing Telos studio system and integrate its studio call-control with a full featured IP PBX, delivering best-of-class voice and calling services to its studio and office staff. As voice services are so vital to Gagasi FM’s operations, platform redundancy was planned within the solution, which would provide extended reliability.</p>
      <p>Within the radio station and local office, the Far South Networks Com.X10 was able to connect six existing Telkom SIP trunks to the Telos Axia system. The new Com.X10 PBX would also deliver VOIP, additional voice channels, enhanced PBX services as well as backup lines via a satellite last-mile connection. </p>
      <p>All the additional functionality that Gagasi FM received is included by default within the standard product package of the Far South Networks PBX. Key functionality included voicemail, voicemail-to-e-mail, call recording, auto-attendant, audio conferencing rooms, call queues and budget trunks, to mention a few.</p>
      <p>”I was tasked to find a system that worked with both the office phones and on-air system, and I am happy to report that we are extremely impressed with the Far South Networks PBXes that were installed," says Gagasi FM’s senior technology engineer. </p>
      <p>“The installation went smoothly and there have been no issues post installation.Ongoing management has been easy, and the units have delivered an ideal voice solution for our environment.”</p>
