      <h1>Hulkenberg not switching to Indycar - boss</h1>
      <h2>Yet another of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nico-hulkenberg/"><b>Nico Hulkenberg</b></a>'s reported options for 2020 has closed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:53:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:53</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>Since being dropped by Renault for 2020, alternatives for the German in Formula 1 at Haas, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/sauber/"><b>Alfa Romeo</b></a> and even Williams have all been ruled out.</p>
      <p>Hulkenberg then admitted that he might be a contender to do the road courses in Indycar next year, with Ed Carpenter's team named by the rumour mill as his likely home.</p>
      <p>But Carpenter himself has now put a stop to that rumour.</p>
      <p>"Next year, I'm to going to race the number 20 on ovals again," he told Germany's motorsport-total.com.</p>
      <p>"There are rumours every year that I'm going to stop, but there's nothing. We'll confirm the second driver around Thanksgiving, but it's not Nico Hulkenberg," Carpenter insisted.</p>
      <p>However, he admitted that he talked "a couple of times" with the 32-year-old F1 driver recently.</p>
      <p>"He was intrigued to see a possibility in Indycar - the timing was simply not right for him," said Carpenter.</p>
      <p>"He has to decide if he really wants a change like Indycar in the long term, but he's not there yet."</p>
