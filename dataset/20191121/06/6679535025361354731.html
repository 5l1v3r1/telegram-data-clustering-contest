      <h1>India Women claim 5-0 T20 series sweep over West Indies</h1>
      <h2>The Rodrigues-Krishnamurthy duo steadied the innings and took the side to a decent total.</h2>

      <p>The Indian women’s cricket team completed a 5-0 series whitewash over the West Indies after half centuries from Veda Krishnamurthy and Jemimah Rodrigues, complemented by the bowlers’ clinical show, steered the side to a 61-run triumph in the fifth and final T20 International here.</p>
      <p>Rodrigues (50) and Krishnamurthy (57 not out) shared 117 runs for the third wicket as India Women scored 134 for 3 after electing to bat.</p>
      <p>The decision seemed to have backfired when India were reduced to 17 for 2 in the fourth over with Shafali Verma (9) and captain Smriti Mandhana (7) getting out cheaply.</p>
      <p>But the Rodrigues-Krishnamurthy duo steadied the innings and took the side to a decent total.</p>
      <p>Rodrigues needed 56 balls for her 50, which was studded with three boundaries, while Krishnamurthy’s unbeaten 57 came off 48 deliveries, which included four hits to the fence.</p>
      <p>In the West Indies run chase, the Indian Women bowlers produced a disciplined performance to restrict the hosts to 73 for 7 in their allotted 20 overs.</p>
      <p>The West Indies were 13 for 2 in the fourth over and they never recovered from that. Half of their batters were out for 53 runs in the 14th over.</p>
      <p>Opener Kyshona Knight was the top-scorer with 22 while Shemaine Campbelle remained not out on 19.</p>
      <p>For India Women, off-spinner Anuja Patil grabbed two wickets for just three runs while Radha Yadav, Poonam Yadav, Pooja Vastrakar and Harleen Deol took a wicket each.</p>
