      <h1>Chess with Grandmasters, under a flyover in Kolkata</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:44:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Nilesh-Bhattacharya-479196783.cms" target="_blank">Nilesh Bhattacharya</a></address>
      <p>KOLKATA: One of south Kolkata’s busiest street junctions, a heavy traffic flow coupled with relentless honking of cars and buses, a group of people pushing and shoving each other to get closer to the action. This can hardly be an ideal or idyllic setting for a battle of minds across a 64-square board.</p>
      <p>However, a small pocket under the busy <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gariahat-flyover">Gariahat flyover</a> — which houses what is now formally known as the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gariahat-Chess-Club">Gariahat Chess Club</a> — did, on Wednesday, ‘host’ a grand show featuring two Grandmasters.</p>
      <p>It was an “extraordinarily amazing” experience for Ding Liren, the highest-rated Chinese <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/chess">chess</a> player, and Japan-born US Grandmaster <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hikaru-Nakamura">Hikaru Nakamura</a> as the duo soaked in the happy chaos around them while playing a friendly rapid fire game, which ended in a draw.</p>
      <p>“This is so unique in nature. You need silence and absolute concentration for your game. And here, you think over your moves on the board, blissfully ignoring the traffic around you. This is just amazing,” Liren told TOI on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“I have never experienced anything like this in my life,” added the Chinese, who finished runner-up in both the 2017 and 2019 edition of the Chess World Cup.</p>
      <p>Nakamura echoed the sentiment.</p>
      <p>“This is so extraordinarily amazing that you have to come here to believe it. If the game is to be made to catch public imagination, I believe this is one way to reach the common people,” the 31-year-old American citizen remarked.</p>
      <p>Both Liren and Nakamura will be competing in the penultimate leg of Grand Chess Tour, which gets under way at the National Library on Friday. For them, the 40-minute-odd rendezvous in the middle of one of the busiest parts of the city late in the afternoon gave them a unique taste of how people turn chaos into concentration over chess boards.</p>
      <p>“This is such an open place and yet people keep playing on, being least bothered by all the distractions. I just wonder how they manage to do this,” Liren said with a smile.</p>
      <p>What started as an informal hangout joint for chess lovers in the mid-1980s, took the shape of a chess club in 2006. The club’s members now include professional and casual chess enthusiasts, students and even hawkers.</p>
      <p>“I’ve heard so much of this place. This is just a whole new experience for me. The players here are so accustomed to playing with so much noise around, I wonder how they would react when they are placed in a silent room for a proper competition,” remarked WGM Tania Sachdev, who beat the city’s first GM Dibyendu Barua in an impromptu rapid fire.</p>
      <p>Of the hundreds of people gathered around the place, International Master Aronyak Ghosh was another ‘spectator’ who returned home with a “dream-come-true” experience.</p>
      <p>Aronyak, who is preparing for pre-Board exams, played out a draw with Liren, much to the delight of the local crowd.</p>
      <p>“Apart from (Magnus) Carlsen, Ding is my hero. This is the first time I played against a player of Ding’s calibre. This is just a dream come true for me,” the teenager said.</p>
