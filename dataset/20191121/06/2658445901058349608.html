      <p>National Council of Women Societies (NCWS), yesterday condemned the alleged murder of Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) Women Leader, Mrs. Salome Abuh and three others in Ochadamu by some political thugs.</p>
      <p>NCWS President Dr. Gloria Shoda, in a statement in Abuja, frowned on the killings.</p>
      <p>She said: “It is bad that in this time in our country, when the role of women has become more imperative, the nation continues to lose lives, especially women.</p>
      <p>“The gruesome murder of Abuh by rampaging political thugs in Kogi on Monday is most outrageous and must be investigated to deter future occurrence.”</p>
      <p>The NCWS president expressed concern that the violence that enveloped the state governorship/Senatorial elections last Saturday could escalate to the killing of the women leader.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Abuh was sleeping in her home when some political thugs set her building ablaze.</p>

      <p>She said: “This is very bad and I am using this opportunity to call on the security agencies to investigate and ensure that perpetrators are brought to book.</p>
      <p>Shoda, who also condemned the manhandling of the candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the Kogi governorship election by thugs, called for appropriate sanction.</p>
      <p>Mrs Akpoti was said to have been manhandled by some thugs during the signing of peace accord in Lokoja by political parties before the election.</p>
