      <h1>Robbie Savage on his new role in management as he offers kids a second chance</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Savage was released from Manchester United's Class of 92 - now he helps players overcome rejection to get their football careers back on track</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Across the 4G pitch in ­Stockport’s hinterlands, there were more cones than the ­endless M6 contraflow.</p>
      <p>Overhead, planes were banking on their final approach to Manchester airport as Robbie Savage ensured his Pro Football Academy All-Stars ­under-14s kept their feet firmly on the ground.</p>
      <p>Savage is taking his first steps in management at grassroots level – and he has found the grass gratifyingly lush, even when stroppy parents are out of order.</p>
      <p>His team won 6-0 at the weekend, and he responded to a late flare-up near the corner flag by pleading with the referee to show restraint.</p>
      <p>A heckler with poor manners and an even weaker sense of parental ­responsibility responded: “Shut up, Savage, you tosser!”</p>

      <p>Savage has already taken his team to play <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> . And on an ­assignment further south, he even gave his players the full away-day experience, including an overnight hotel stop.</p>
      <p>His crusade has reawakened the playing beast within.</p>
      <p>At 45, Savage is contemplating signing for Stockport Town of the North West Counties League, in ­English football’s 10th tier, and could make his comeback within a ­fortnight.</p>
      <p>Pro Football Academy have bought Stockport Town and the club will become a conduit for recycled young talent, giving them a pathway either back into the game or to ­further education.</p>
      <p>Savage is familiar with the stigma of rejection. Manchester United ­released him from the Class of ‘92 and he took the scenic route to fulfilment through Crewe, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , ­Birmingham, ­Blackburn and Derby.</p>

      <p>Just as Glenn ­Hoddle once ran a school to give older ‘rejects’ a second chance, and Jamie Vardy’s V9 academy does much the same, Pro Football Academy rescues the dreams of kids who have fallen off the conveyor belt at professional clubs.</p>
      <p>“This has given me the buzz back,” said Savage. The Academy offers a chance to kids not only let go by clubs, and Savage added: “I go in the office – I’ve even got my own desk. We’ve got 36 centres, and by the end of next year we’re aiming for 150 ­centres for 10,000 kids.</p>
      <p>“We look to take on kids who have been rejected by clubs, whether they are too small, too slow or whatever, give them a coaching structure to help them find other clubs and keep their dreams of professional football alive.</p>
      <p>"I know what rejection feels like so I can help with the mental side as well as the disciplines, tactics and techniques.</p>
      <p>“This season, five players from my team have been picked up by clubs – <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , Preston, Rochdale and two by <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> - on extended trials.</p>

      <p>"Across all the age groups, from five to 18, we must have had 100 signed by clubs. To see lads given another shot by pro clubs is the ­biggest thrill.”</p>
      <p>Five years ago, Pro Football ­Academy was launched by director Carlos Roca, a midfielder of no fixed reputation at Oldham and Carlisle, to bridge the gap between grassroots and the professional game, starting with half a dozen boys on a five-a-side pitch in Wythenshawe.</p>
      <p>Today, Roca and local entrepreneur and partner Rob Smethurst are not just running a cottage industry, they are building an empire.</p>
      <p>The team at Pro Football Academy won the Lloyds Bank New Business of the Year. It employs 100 staff, including 60 coaches, and Savage said: “People have started calling us the ‘Dream Team’ and saying it’s not fair because we are picking off the best talent in the area – but that’s not true.</p>
      <p>“I will never approach a promising lad, through his parents, during the season and deny a grassroots club of their best player.</p>
      <p>“If they ring me and say, ‘My son wants an opportunity’ at Pro Football Academy we can give them a chance to learn and to gain experience from professional coaches.”</p>
      <p>The last time Savage was let loose on a desk, he was gyrating in front of the judges’ noses on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> . Now he’s a big player in a brilliant set-up making the dreams of schoolboys come true.</p>
