      <p>A fourth teacher has filed a lawsuit against Epic Charter Schools, alleging she was fired after objecting to questionable enrollment practices.</p>
      <p>Ryan Aispuro said Epic terminated her employment “because she resisted pressure to manipulate Epic’s truancy standards.” The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Oklahoma County District Court, requesting at least $75,000 in damages.</p>
      <p>Aispuro described similar circumstances as three other teachers who sued the virtual charter school. One of the teachers, Noelle Waller, dropped her lawsuit Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>“We have no comment as this matter is under litigation,” said Shelly Hickman, Epic’s assistant superintendent of communications. “However, we are pleased one of these suits has already been dismissed. We are confident and eager to present our case regarding this former, disgruntled employee.”</p>
      <p>Aispuro said Epic pressured her to strictly enforce attendance and truancy standards on students with below-average academic ability but not against students with stronger performance. The lawsuit states she questioned this practice multiple times.</p>
      <p>Students who are marked absent for 10 consecutive school days are dropped from enrollment, and the Oklahoma State Department of Education considers them as non-full-academic-year students, or NFAY. Students marked as NFAY don’t count against their school’s overall test scores, even if they re-enroll.</p>
      <p>Poor student performance would’ve had a negative effect on bonuses for those above her in Epic’s hierarchy, she said. Aispuro’s bonus also would have been affected.</p>
      <p>Epic, the state’s largest virtual charter school, offers significant bonuses to teachers based on student retention, test scores, attendance and ability to move on to the next grade level.</p>
      <p>Aispuro said Epic fired her June 18, 2018, before she could collect her annual bonus July 1. She was hired May 4, 2017.</p>
      <p>Her principal approached her with alleged complaints from two parents reporting a lack of communication from Aispuro. The teacher provided text messages and emails showing she attempted to contact those families, but she was fired regardless, according to the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>In a lawsuit filed Oct. 25, Jason Deskin alleged Epic classified students as truant when it became apparent they wouldn’t pass state tests.</p>
      <p>Deskin said he overheard an Epic administrator talking about maximizing bonuses with other teachers during a break at a professional development meeting.</p>
      <p>The administrator told them the best way is for teachers to figure out which students won’t perform well on state tests and then remove them from their rolls by manipulating truancy standards, according to the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Deskin reported this to his principal and said he wouldn’t label students as truant unless they actually were.</p>
      <p>“(The principal) responded that this was just what had to be done, implying that Deskin was expected to fall in line,” the lawsuit states.</p>
      <p>Deskin was fired after being accused of negatively affecting his performance at Epic by being the primary substitute teacher at Lexington Public Schools. Deskin said he only substitute taught a few times, and his principal at Epic was aware of it.</p>
      <p>His termination in June 2018 came a month before Epic would have to pay him his annual bonus on July 1, the lawsuit states. He had been hired in July 2017.</p>
      <p>Waller and Shauna Atchley both made similar allegations when they sued Epic on Aug. 30. Both said they objected to manipulating enrollment and were fired before they could receive bonuses.</p>
      <p>Hickman said Waller and Atchley were “disgruntled former employees hoping to profit from what they perceive to be the issue of the day.”</p>
      <p>"I cannot comment about personnel issues, but I can tell you that these employees are no longer employed with us, and for good reason,” Hickman said in a statement in the days after they filed their lawsuits.</p>
      <p>Deskin and Atchley are all suing for at least $75,000 in damages.</p>
      <p>The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation also alleged Epic manipulated its enrollment by forcing students into truancy. These students would be re-enrolled after they were classified as NFAY, according to a search warrant filed in district court.</p>
      <p>The OSBI is investigating allegations of embezzlement and racketeering by Epic and its co-founders.</p>
      <p>Epic has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
