      <h1>Khloe Kardashian Shares The Cutest Pic Ever Of ‘Besties’ True Thompson, 1, &amp; Chicago West, 1</h1>

      <h4>Khloe shared the most adorable moment of cousins True and Chicago as they hugged each other by a pool!</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/true-thompson/"><b>True Thompson</b></a>, 1, and <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/chicago-west/"><b>Chicago West</b></a>, 1, are cousin #GOALS! True’s mom <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/khloe-kardashian/"><b>Khloe Kardashian</b></a>, 35, posted the cutest pic ever of <b>Kim Kardashian</b>‘s daughter Chicago embracing her at sunset by an outdoor pool. Khloe appropriately captioned the snap — which has over two million likes — “➳ ♡ Besties ➳ ♡.” as the pair posed candidly. The girls were totally styling for the casual snap, as 19-month-old True rocked a long sleeve black t-shirt that said “Mini Givenchy” while 22-month-old Chicago sported a beige waffle knit sweater that had dad <b>Kanye West</b>‘s style written <i>all</i> over it!</p>
      <p>Khloe’s followers, including some of her close friends, immediately began flooding her comments and we were right there with them! “😍😍” <b>Paris Hilton</b> — who grew up with the KarJenner’s — appropriately captioned. <i>The Real</i> host <b>Adrienne Bailon</b>, who dated Khloe’s brother <b>Rob Kardashian</b> from 2007 to 2009 — wrote “So beautiful!” while friend and <i>Relatively Nat &amp; Liv </i>star Natalie Halcro added “Look at them.” <b>Kris Jenner</b>‘s BFF <b>Faye Resnick</b> — who’s a grandmother herself — also jumped in with four heart emojis!</p>
      <p>True has become quite the star alongside her fabulous mama lately, and it appears she may even get her very own show! “[<b>Kris Jenner</b>] and I are having a meeting with producers that we’re in talks with about helping me finalize the show that I’m developing,” Khloe revealed on <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</i>, explaining that the series would be about her life with baby True. The producer featured in the segment suggested the episodes would showcase the pair’s home life and adventures out-and-about — like their <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/16/khloe-kardashian-true-thompson-farmers-market-cute-pic/">recent trip to the Calabasas Farmer’s Market</a> — in short five to seven minute episodes.</p>

      <p>The photo also comes amidst True’s dad <b>Tristan Thompson</b>, 28, making a serious effort <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/09/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-truth-about-getting-back-together-details/">to get back together</a> with Khloe. The couple called things quits after Tristan was caught cheating multiple times — including with <b>Kylie Jenner</b>‘s BFF <b>Jordyn Woods </b>— but Tristan doesn’t appear to be giving up: he recently sent Khloe a super romantic balloon display that read “Pink Diamond” for her new KKW fragrance launch with Kim, and also revealed he was “so proud” of Khloe for her wins at the <i>E! People’s Choice Awards</i>.</p>
