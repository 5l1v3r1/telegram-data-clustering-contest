      <h2>South Lanarkshire Council approved the long-awaited proposals under delegated powers to refurbish Greenhills Shopping Centre which has been struggling in recent years.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Findlay, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicola-findlay/</a></address>
      <p>Plans to transform the ailing Greenhills Shopping Centre have been agreed by South Lanarkshire Council.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride News</a> revealed earlier this year that ambitious fresh proposals had been lodged with the council.</p>
      <p>They have now been agreed by officers under delegated powers – meaning it didn’t go before the council’s planning committee – and include a soft-play and two hot food takeaways.</p>
      <p>Businesses have been calling for investment in the centre for a number of years with footfall dwindling at the once-thriving shopping centre.</p>
      <p>Local councillors have also called for investment by landlords to secure its future in the long term.</p>
      <p>Several sets of plans have been forward over the last four years but nothing has come to fruition.</p>
      <p>The shopping centre was also briefly put up for auction last year by property managers F1 Real Estate but then removed after just two days.</p>
      <p>They remain landlords for part of the shopping centre but the plans for the area undercover to be refurbished were submitted on behalf of a Mr Z Ahmed.</p>

      <p>These also include reorientation of shop fronts externally, extension to form two retail units, change of use of detached toilet block to retail unit, and alterations to the car park with a total of 140 free car parking spaces – an additional 55.</p>
      <p>Plans also include landscaping of some areas and replacement footpaths as well as bicycle stands.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> South Councillor Archie Buchanan said: “This is long overdue – anything is better than what we have just now.</p>
      <p>“The butchers have left and the last few times I have been there the place has been empty.</p>
      <p>“Anything that generates interest in the place and gets people using it again is most welcome – because as things stand it’s pretty dire.</p>
      <p>“The investment is a benefit in particular for the residents of the three sheltered housing complexes who live nearby, many of them who can’t just travel further afield for their shopping.</p>
      <p>“And hopefully it will create some more job opportunities for local people.”</p>
      <p>No letters of objection to the plans were received by the council.</p>

      <p>In their report council officers say proposal “will have no significant adverse impact upon amenity or the character of the neighbourhood centre” and it complies with the relevant policies including South Lanarkshire Council’s Local Plan.</p>
      <p>The report added that the plans “will help bring the centre back into use and support the vitality and viability of the neighbourhood centre.”</p>
