        <b>Serge Gnabry said he found talk about Germany undergoing a rebuilding phase annoying after scoring a hat-trick in a 6-1 rout of Northern Ireland that secured them top spot in Group C yesterday morning (Singapore time).</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having already booked their Euro 2020 berth last Saturday by beating Belarus, the emphatic win in Frankfurt means Germany finish their qualifying campaign two points ahead of Holland.</p>
      <p>Germany coach Joachim Loew has sought to freshen up his team after the debacle of their group-stage exit at last year's World Cup and has jettisoned experienced heads Mats Hummels, 30; Jerome Boateng, 31, and Thomas Mueller, 30.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich attacker Gnabry, 24, is part of a new generation to have stepped up, with 13 goals in 13 caps - including nine goals this year.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's annoying to keep hearing and talking about a rebuilding phase.</p>
      <p>"Yes, we've got a young team - we all get along very well. We always play well, we play very attractive football.</p>
      <p>"We weren't always able to get the results we wanted, but it's looking a lot better now.</p>
      <p>"I think we'll go into the tournament with confidence - we're on a good run, aside from the (4-2) loss to Holland."</p>
      <p>Bayern midfielder Leon Goretzka, also 24, bagged a brace while 23-year-old Julian Brandt added gloss to the scoreline in added time as Die Mannschaft bounced back from Michael Smith's seventh-minute opener for Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Said Loew: "I've always had the highest possible opinion of Gnabry...</p>
      <p>"He was always one to pass the ball to, he doesn't play up front all the time, he lets himself fall back a bit and you can find him anywhere on the pitch and he's able to play in many different positions.</p>
      <p>"These are prime qualities in any player, and also his finishing is technically fantastic."</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill, meanwhile, said he was baffled as to why Gnabry did not make a bigger impact in England with Arsenal and West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>Said the newly appointed Stoke City manager: "Gnabry's goalscoring record is phenomenal. It's a mystery to me how English clubs didn't get more out of him.</p>
      <p>"I'd be surprised if this Germany team doesn't make a big impact (at Euro 2020)."</p>
      <p>Loew, however, said before the match that six teams are better placed than his side to win the Euros.</p>
      <p>He said: "Teams like England, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Holland are ahead of us.</p>
      <p>"They've had a generational revamp. But I don't see us as favourites for the Euros."</p>
      <p>It was a sentiment seconded by Emre Can after the match at the Commerzbank-Arena.</p>
      <p>He said: "A 6-1 win, it has to be a big statement...</p>
      <p>"But I think we are a young group who haven't played that often together... Of course, we go to the Euros to win it, but I don't think we are favourites."</p>
