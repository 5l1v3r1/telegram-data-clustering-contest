      <p>She welcomed Proscia with food, coffee, and gift cards to thank him, but soon, he had to turn around and drive back, in order to get Bagels 101 open at 5:30 a.m. On the way home, Proscia said he was pulled over for speeding, but when the officer heard why he was in a hurry to get back, he let him go with a warning.
