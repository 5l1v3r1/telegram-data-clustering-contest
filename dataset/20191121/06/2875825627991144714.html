      <h1>Thurles horse racing tips: Peter O'Hehir's picks for Thursday November 21st</h1>
      <h2>There are 7 races on the card this evening</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/peter-ohehir/" target="_blank">Peter O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Footpad, a four-time Grade 1 winner as a novice, will be expected to make a successful return to action in the listed Boomerang.ie Chase in Thurles.</p>
      <p>The Willie Mullins-trained seven-year-old hasn’t run since bagging a Grade 1 at the 2018 Punchestown Festival.</p>
      <p>Last season, Footpad endured a troubled campaign, reportedly interrupted by over-reach problems.</p>
      <p>On his seasonal debut in a Grade 3 at Naas, he looked beaten when falling at the last behind Saint Calvados.</p>
      <p>In a Grade 1 at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting, he went clear before the last and looked a sure thing before fading late and being collared close home by Simply Ned.</p>
      <p>Footpad was last seen when dropping away tamely to fill eighth position behind Frodon in the Ryanair at Cheltenham.</p>
      <p>Daryl Jacob’s mount has to rebuild his reputation over the coming months. While unproven over this sort of trip, he’s expected to get the job done here, although rated just 2lb superior to Henry de Bromhead’s Balko Des Flos, helped by his comeback fourth to Jett at Punchestown.</p>
      <p>Mullins has his team in flying early-season form.</p>
      <p>The Closutton juggernaut has prospects of another four-timer on today’s card, with five-time hurdle winner Good Thyne Tara set to make a successful start to her chasing career in the opener.</p>
      <p>Having achieved a career-high mark of 150 over timber, the nine-year-old is coming late to chasing but looks a stand-out here on her thirds behind Roksana and Benie Des Dieux in Grade 1 events at Cheltenham and Punchestown respectively last spring.</p>
      <p>Later, Allez Dance, fifth to stable-companion Janidil in a hot handicap hurdle at Down Royal on her seasonal debut, sets the standard in the INH Stallion Owners Rated Novice Hurdle.</p>
      <p>Asterion Forlonge, bought for £290,000 having won his point for Pay Doyle in Oldtown, will be all the rage on his racecourse debut in the bumper.</p>
      <p>But the nap vote is reserved for Declan Queally’s Uisce Solas, a winner of bumpers at Wexford and Tipperary, in the Thurles Racecourse Mares Maiden Hurdle.</p>
      <p>Darragh O’Keeffe’s mount ran creditably against the classy Surin on her hurdling bow in Wexford before being out of her depth in the Grade 3 For Auction, won by Abacadabras, in Navan.</p>
      <p>Dropping in class, Uisce Solas should be capable of conceding 8lb to the consistent but exposed My Midnight.</p>
