        <b>Singapore coach Tatsuma Yoshida said yesterday that the Lions' World Cup 2022 qualifying win away to Yemen was proof that his side can win without key players.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 2-1 triumph at Al Muharraq Stadium in Bahrain - Yemen have to host their home matches at a neutral venue due to an ongoing civil war - was achieved without wingers Faris Ramli (personal reasons), Shawal Anuar (injury) and left-back Shakir Hamzah (disciplinary reasons).</p>
      <p>The trio have been regular starters for the 45-year-old Japanese coach.</p>
      <p>Despite the absentees, the Lions coach told The New Paper before the game that it was a "must-win" match, and his players duly obliged.</p>
      <p>Said Yoshida: "I am really happy to get this good result for the Singapore fans back home.</p>
      <p>"We said before the match that it was a must-win, and it is important that we got it.</p>
      <p>"The result may be surprising for some people, but it is not a surprise for me.</p>
      <p>"The boys have shown a great attitude and I trust them.</p>
      <p>"We showed that we could win even without some important players (Faris, Shakir and Shawal). The others stepped up and proved themselves."</p>
      <p>Among the others who also stepped up was Hafiz Nor, who bagged the winner.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old winger scored his first goal in his sixth cap in the 52nd minute of the Group D tie.</p>
      <p>He cut inside his defender on the left flank and curled a brilliant strike from just outside the box which clipped the post and nestled into Salem Saeed's net.</p>
      <p>Said Hafiz: "I am very happy to get my first international goal and it was one to remember.</p>
      <p>"When I got the ball, the only thing in my mind was to beat the player and go for a shot; that was what coach told me to do in training and I am happy I did it."</p>
      <p>While the absent Faris, Shakir and Shawal are key players for the Lions, perhaps no one is more important to Yoshida now than striker Ikhsan Fandi.</p>
      <p>The youngest member of the squad at 20 opened the scoring against Yemen against the run of play when he met Shahdan Sulaiman's 19th-minute corner with a well-struck volley from just inside the box.</p>
      <h3>ONE CLEAN SHEET</h3>
      <p>However, Nasser Al-Gahwashi's goal five minutes from time meant that the Lions have kept only one clean sheet - in a 0-0 draw with Jordan at the Amman International Stadium last month - in Yoshida's nine matches in charge.</p>
      <p>Despite that, there are positives to be taken after the Lions moved up to third in Group D, two points adrift of group leaders Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p>The win over Yemen was Singapore's first away success against a higher-ranked Middle-Eastern team since another 2-1 win against Lebanon in Beirut in a World Cup qualifier in 2008.</p>
      <p>Said Hafiz: "We did pretty well and followed the game plan; we played as a team and won as a team.</p>
      <p>"Playing against Middle-Eastern opposition is not easy, but we achieved the win and everyone is very happy about it."</p>
