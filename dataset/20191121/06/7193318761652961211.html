      <p>NORMAN — When the Sooners took the court against William &amp; Mary on Monday, there was something different about De’Vion Harmon.</p>
      <p>Harmon was wearing a black headband with a white jumpman logo around his forehead. It was the first time this season he’d worn a headband in a game, but it wasn’t something completely new to him. Harmon used to wear a headband in games when he was in high school. He wore it until the middle of his junior year and then stopped.</p>
      <p>After scoring 22 points in the exhibition and 23 in the Sooners’ season opener, Harmon has fallen into a shooting slump in recent games, and he’s trying to mix things up, make sure he’s having fun playing basketball.</p>
      <p>“(I) wanted to see how it felt to put it back on,” Harmon said.</p>
      <p>While Harmon has struggled to score lately, averaging 5.3 points and shooting just 19% from the field over the Sooners’ last three games, he has still been impactful. As the point guard, Harmon has been able to distribute the ball well and put his teammates in situations to score.</p>
      <p>“As good point guards do, they're kind of responsible for everyone. Not just their numbers. I thought last night De'Vion did a really good job,” Oklahoma coach Lon Kruger said. “He didn't score a lot, but he moved the ball. He created good opportunities for others.”</p>
      <p>For his struggles offensively, Kruger said he thinks Harmon has been giving a solid defensive effort. When in a slump, Harmon said he tries to turn his game up in other areas such as defense, rebounding and ball pressure. He just tries to do everything else when his shots aren’t falling.</p>
      <p>“Basketball is a game of runs,” Harmon said. “It's a game you really got to be patient with… If you're in a shooting slump or a scoring slump, you gotta keep playing.”</p>
      <p>Great players shoot themselves out of slumps, Harmon said, and that’s what he’s trying to do.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Harmon’s headband look will continue when the Sooners take on Maryland Eastern Shore on Thursday in Lloyd Noble Center. The headband didn’t change things much for scoring ability against William &amp; Mary. He only scored 8 points and was 0-of-2 from 3-point range. That doesn’t mean it won’t return, though.</p>
      <p>“It looked good to me, though,” Harmon said. “So I guess I'll figure out if I'll wear it Thursday or not.”</p>
