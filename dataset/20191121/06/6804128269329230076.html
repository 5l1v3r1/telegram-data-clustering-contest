      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino's next job after Tottenham Hotspur exit</h1>
      <h2>Bayern Munich will reportedly appoint Mauricio Pochettino as their next boss at the end of the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:30</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>Bayern Munich will keep caretaker manager Hansi Flick until the end of the season before appointing Mauricio Pochettino as their next permanent manager, reports in Germany state.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Pochettino </a>is available following his sacking at Tottenham on Tuesday evening and he was quickly installed as the favourite to become Niko Kovac's successor in Bavaria.</p>
      <p>However, one major issue is the fact that the Argentine boss does not speak German but <a href="https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/sport/fussball/fussball/fc-bayern-muenchen-die-wahrheit-ueber-mauricio-pochettino-66151008,view=conversionToLogin.bild.html">Bild state</a> there could be a workaround, bringing Pochettino to the Allianz Arena next summer.</p>
      <p>The report identifies that this would give Pochettino several months to get to grips with at least the basics of the German language before taking the reigns of the Bundesliga giants.</p>
      <p>It is also added that <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/bayern-munich">Bayern</a>'s sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic is a big fan of Pochettino and has met the Argentine boss in the past, while the club is also no longer as strict with the German-speaking criterion.</p>
      <p>Uli Hoeness is said to have been the biggest advocate of this rule and Bayern like Pochettino so much that they could drop it entirely in order for the former Espanyol and Southampton boss to arrive in German football.</p>
      <p>Bayern could face immense competition in the market for Pochettino's services though, as he has been heavily linked with previous vacancies at Manchester United and Real Madrid during his time in North London.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has also been muted as a potential successor to Lionel Scaloni in charge of Argentina's national side, although his position seems stable ahead of next summer's Copa America following a sequence of seven matches without defeat.</p>
