      <p>HWASEONG (Seoul), Nov 21 — Under the watchful gaze of Samsung Electronics security personnel, health and safety staffer Ko Jee-hun stood outside his semiconductor plant, handing out leaflets touting the benefits of joining a trade union.</p>
      <p>For almost 50 years the firm avoided unionisation of its employees — sometimes adopting ferocious tactics according to critics — while rising to become the world’s largest smartphone and semiconductor manufacturer.</p>
      <p>It is the flagship subsidiary of the giant Samsung Group, by far the biggest of the family-controlled conglomerates, known as “chaebol”, that dominate the world’s 11th-largest economy.</p>
      <p>But last week local authority officials in Suwon, where the chipmaker is headquartered, certified the National Samsung Electronics Union.</p>
      <p>It is affiliated to the powerful Federation of Korean Trade Unions umbrella group (FKTU), and analysts say the move could spell trouble down the line for the firm.</p>
      <p>Ko is the union’s deputy general secretary. “What’s at stake here is more than wages,” he said as he mounted a recruitment drive this week.</p>
      <p>“We demand communication and to have our voices heard. Because we are not just components.”</p>
      <p>The leaflets he handed out showed a series of cartoon characters complaining about issues from holidays and lunch breaks to forced early retirement and unexplained bonus reductions.</p>
      <p>“The real union has arrived,” it proclaimed, with a link and QR codes for employees to sign up.</p>
      <p>The security guards would not let him stand directly outside the factory gate in Hwaseong, about 50 kilometres south of Seoul, forcing him to take up a position at the next intersection — but almost all passers-by took a copy.</p>
      <p>“The fight has just only begun,” Ko told AFP.</p>
      <p>Ahead of its formal establishment the union registered 400 expressions of interest from Samsung Electronics employees, the FKTU says.</p>
      <p>The new group has set itself a goal of signing up 10,000 members — almost 10 per cent of the workforce — which analysts say could see it demand a right to collective bargaining.</p>

        <b>‘Dismiss before launch’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Samsung’s founder Lee Byung-chul, who died in 1987, was adamantly opposed to unions, saying he would never allow them “until I have dirt over my eyes”.</p>
      <p>Internal documents from 2012 obtained by a South Korean MP instructed managers to control “problematic personnel” seeking to establish unions.</p>
      <p>“To avoid claims of unfair labour practices, dismiss key organisers before the launch of a union”, it read, among other recommendations.</p>
      <p>But organisers have seized the opportunity presented by the left-leaning government of President Moon Jae-in — a former rights lawyer who represented trade unions — and controversy around the bribery trial of the company’s vice-chairman Lee Jae-yong, the founder’s grandson.</p>
      <p>It also faces challenges from the US-China trade war and export restrictions imposed by Tokyo on key supplies as part of a dispute with Seoul over wartime forced labour.</p>
      <p>“The level of repression is much weaker now than before,” said the union’s Ko. “I think the company is being cautious over possible repercussions.”</p>
      <p>Samsung Electronics declined to comment to AFP.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Problematic personnel</b>
      </p>
      <p>Samsung’s share price soared in 2016-7 and a staffer who asked to be identified only as Kim welcomed the union’s establishment personally, hoping for higher year-end bonuses and other benefits.</p>
      <p>But the global chip market has since seen a prolonged downturn and Kim also feared the union’s possible impact when even small production delays “could result in a significant loss of market share”.</p>
      <p>“Waging a collective strike could be fatal,” he added.</p>
      <p>Samsung Electronics’ no-union policy was “anachronistic”, but it could now end up following “in the footsteps of Hyundai Motor embroiled in strikes every year”, the <i>Korea Times</i> warned in an editorial.</p>
      <p>Higher labour costs could also impact its business model, which is based on large-scale, long term investments, said Sejong University business professor Kim Dae-jong.</p>
      <p>“With the labour union, it could find it much harder to carry out large investments with finances diverted to pay for increased wages,” he said.</p>
      <p>Three unions were set up at Samsung last year, but none of them had the backing of a bigger federation and fizzled after attracting only a handful of members.</p>
      <p>Samsung needed to move with the times and acknowledge that standards had changed since its founder’s time, said Chun Soon-ok, a labour campaigner and former MP whose brother burned himself to death in 1970 in protest at brutal working conditions in the textile industry.</p>
      <p>Unions also needed to move on from previous militancy, Chun added.</p>
      <p>In the past, unions and management “saw each other as competitors to knock down in a boxing ring”, she said. “But the 21st century requires them to dance together in partnership”. — AFP</p>
