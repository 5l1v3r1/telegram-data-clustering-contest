      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mindhunter/">Mindhunter</a> season three is currently on pause so we could be waiting quite a while for the next chapter to land on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a>.</p>
      <p>Fans have been eagerly anticipating the crime thriller’s renewal following<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/15/time-mindhunter-season-2-come-netflix-joins-cast-10577626/"> series two’s launch earlier this year</a>, but showrunner David Fincher is currently preoccupied with another major project according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jonathan-groff-balancing-impossibly-bleak-world-mindhunter-beyonce-1255563">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
      <p>The publication reported: ‘Talk of a third season of Mindhunter is on hold while Fincher focuses on his next feature.’</p>
      <p>Fincher’s next film has been commissioned by the streaming giant and is a black and white movie called Mark, which tells the story about Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz.</p>
      <p>Netflix has yet to actually confirm whether there will be a third season of Mindhunter, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be one just yet.</p>

      <p>‘We are hopeful that we will get to do the whole five seasons because the audience seems to have really responded to the show, people really like the show.</p>
      <p>‘And we’re very proud of the show, and very excited to keep making the show.’</p>
      <p>McCallany previously revealed that Fincher is keen to roll out five seasons of Mindhunter, much to everyone’s delight.</p>
      <p>‘Because you know I believe in his talent, you know, and I know that you know, he [Fincher] wants to do five years of this show,’ he said to <a href="https://screenrant.com/mindhunter-david-fincher-5-seasons/">Screen Rant</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Five seasons of these characters and so I’m hopeful, you know I don’t take anything for granted.’</p>
