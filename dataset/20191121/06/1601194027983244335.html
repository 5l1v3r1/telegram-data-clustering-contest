      <h3>Sneijder reminisces incredible partnership with Guti at Real Madrid</h3>
      <p>Guti broke through the youth ranks at the Santiago Bernabeu and was a regular starter in the Real Madrid team before Sneijder's arrival in the Spanish capital.</p>
      <p>Sneijder joined Los Blancos in 2007 and spent two seasons at the club, winning La Liga in his debut campaign. The Dutchman initially replaced Guti in the squad but later formed a lethal partnership with the Spaniard.</p>

      <p>When asked to name the greatest player he has ever played with, Sneijder told <a href="https://twitter.com/FOXSportsnl/status/1197240246523564032">Fox Sports</a> via Dutch daily <a href="https://www.ad.nl/nederlands-voetbal/sneijder-ik-had-in-het-rijtje-met-ronaldo-en-messi-kunnen-staan~a40364b1/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;fbclid=IwAR0CdmaaNSqdAhWH-BTrDmkTJ2yPrcu-qICPND8_CvLLW2iRmoFHOCSlhXY">Algemeen Dagblad</a>,</p>
      <blockquote>"The best soccer player I have ever played with is Guti. He was so good. Perhaps it is because he was somewhat unknown.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I remember I was completely surprised by him after seeing him training for the first time at Real Madrid.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"What a soccer player he was. Phenomenal. We finally clicked. If he got the ball with his back to me, he would still find me."</blockquote>
      <p>While Sneijder announced his retirement from professional football earlier this year, Guti had recently taken up his debut managerial job in charge of Segunda Division side Almeria.</p>
