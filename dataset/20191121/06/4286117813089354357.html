      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Asaduddin Owaisi's party AIMIM has won two seats in Maharashtra and nearly doubled vote share</li>
        <li>Owaisi's party also won key Kishenganj seat in Bihar assembly bypoll, has 30 members in UP local bodies</li>
        <li>Owaisi's rise as a Muslim leader has left Mamata Banerjee worried in Bengal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Dressed in trademark sherwani, sporting the traditional skull cap and shaven upper lip, AIMIM leader and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi has tried to project himself as the voice of Muslims, with a claim that he is the only true voice of the community in today's India. His assertion has been so profligate in TV studios, on social media and in public speeches that speechwriter-poet and former Rajya Sabha MP Javed Akhtar picked him out in his farewell speech in Parliament.</p>
      <p>Without naming Owaisi, Javed Akhtar had dismissed him saying, "There is one gentleman, who thinks he is a national leader. However, the truth is that he is a leader of one mohalla (locality) of one city of one of the states of India, Andhra Pradesh. He said he will not chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Glory to Mother India)because the Constitution does not ask him to do so. Then, the Constitution does not ask him to wear to sherwani and sport skull cap either."</p>
      <p>In three-and-a-half years since Akhtar delivered his farewell speech, a lot has changed. His party has increased its vote share in the recently held Maharashtra Assembly election and made debut in Bihar Assembly through a bypoll. His videos are shared on social media giving him greater access, particularly among the educated Muslim youth.</p>
      <p>Today Owaisi is heard widely across several states - from Maharashtra to Bengal. This is why a seasoned and maverick politician like Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who takes pride in having a huge following among the Muslim voters, has suddenly changed tack and launched a scathing attack on Asaduddin Owaisi in the wake of the Supreme Court verdict in the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute of Ayodhya.</p>
      <p>"Don't trust leaders who come from outside and try to present themselves as your (minority) sympathisers. Only leaders from Bengal can fight for your cause. Those who are visiting from Hyderabad with money bags and claiming to be sympathisers of Muslims are the biggest allies of the BJP," news agency PTI quoted Mamata Banerjee as saying at a public rally in Bengal.</p>
      <p>In the past, during the Singur agitation, Mamata Banerjee and Asaduddin Owaisi were on the same side of the political battle. Electorally, Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress depends a lot on over 30 per cent Muslim vote in the 294-member Bengal Assembly. With the rise of Owaisi as a strong Muslim leader, Mamata Banerjee fears loss of vote to the AIMIM at a time when the BJP is making inroads in the state. This only establishes the claim of Owaisi as the "lone voice for Muslims".</p>
      <p>
        <b>BEFORE MAMATA FUMED</b>
      </p>
      <p>This has a backdrop.</p>
      <p>In Maharashtra, Owaisi's AIMIM, won two seats, same as 2014 but almost doubled its vote percentage. It is another matter that Owaisi's party lost both seats it won in 2014 - Aurangabad Central and Byculla - and won Dhule City and Malegaon Central seats this time. For 2019, it contested on 44 of the 288 seats in Maharashtra. Besides winning the two seats, it came second on four others.</p>
      <p>In Bihar, AIMIM won the Kishenganj assembly bypoll in a contest where the Congress-RJD alliance was also a challenger. The party had done fairly well in the Kieshenganj Lok Sabha constituency during parliamentary election. Owaisi's AIMIM is also making inroads in Uttar Pradesh, particularly in the municipal bodies. The party has around 30 members in various urban local bodies in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>Owaisi has been touring Kishenganj and surrounding areas - Araria and Purnea - of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, holding public meetings where he has been getting good traction for past couple of years. Participation of large number of youths in his public meetings in the Muslim-dominated belt of Bihar stands out.</p>
      <p>His appeal among the Muslim youths comes from his oratory skills and fluency in English and Urdu. Owaisi is a lawyer, having received training at Lincoln's Inn in London, the same place where Muhammad Ali Jinnah was trained as a barrister in pre-Independence era.</p>
      <p>
        <b>AT THE OTHER END OF HINDUTVA POLITICS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Owaisi's rise in politics coincides with the consolidation of Hindutva vote for the BJP and "secular" parties' response to it. The pre-eminence of Narendra Modi and his strategist-cum-party colleague, Amit Shah, in the BJP has made the "secular" parties wary of speaking for Muslims.</p>
      <p>For example, the Congress in the past five years has tried to shed the tag of being pro-minority (read Muslim) party. The BJP has long accused the Congress of Muslim appeasement for electoral gains. Veteran BJP leader LK Advani popularised the term, pseudo-secularism to target the Congress.</p>
      <p>The term and the charge started building narrative against the Congress after Manmohan Singh, as prime minister, stated that the minority community (read Muslims again) has the first claim on the national resources. The BJP supported its accusation citing previous statements of clerics, including the head of Delhi's Jama Masjid, asking Muslims to vote for the Congress.</p>
      <p>This helped the BJP push its Hindutva agenda more aggressively. The elevation of Narendra Modi in 2013-14 from state to national level further consolidated the "anti-minority-appeasement" votes in the BJP's favour.</p>
      <p>As a response to this, the Congress, which depended on consolidation of Muslim votes for long, tried to present itself as a party that was competing for the same vote bank as the BJP.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SECULAR SPACE LEFT VACANT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rahul Gandhi as Congress president went far ahead to prove himself a janeudhari (wearer of the sacred thread) Brahmin and his family a devout worshipper of Lord Shiva. He undertook a pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar. In every election campaign, Rahul Gandhi was seen hopping from one temple to another. His sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra followed suit.</p>
      <p>Other parties, including the Samajwadi Party of Mulayam Singh in Uttar Pradesh and the Janata Dal (United) of Nitish Kumar in Bihar, got wary of being seen as pro-Muslim parties. Mulayam Singh Yadav, who had earned the sobriquet of Maulana Mulayam and his son Akhilesh Yadav were seen asserting on Yadav identity or neutral politics.</p>
      <p>All these parties tended to give fewer tickets to Muslim candidates in elections to state assemblies and the Lok Sabha. This move by the self-proclaimed secular parties left an average Muslim voter confused. The Muslim electoral space had been ceded by these parties for the fear that the BJP might take advantage of it and push them more towards the margins.</p>
      <p>This vacuum helped Owaisi herald his rise in Indian politics with his Muslim version of Hindutva politics.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MUSLIM IDENTITY ON SLEEVES</b>
      </p>
      <p>Owaisi contested his first election in 1994, two years after the Babri Masjid was demolished by kar sevaks who had gathered in Ayodhya in December 1992 at the call of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and supported by the BJP. But his influence for next two decades was limited to Hyderabad where his father had built his political fortune with the All Indian Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM).</p>
      <p>His rise in politics as a Muslim leader is marked with the ceding of Muslim electoral space by the so-called secular parties. He began attacking the Congress and other "secular" parties, accusing them of blackmailing Muslims by exploiting their fear of the BJP. With the rise of Modi in the national politics, Owaisi started getting traction in areas far beyond Hyderabad.</p>
      <p>Owaisi's acceptance, if the trend persists, is a sign of a definite shift in the voting pattern of Muslims, who till now preferred a party advocating composite culture in the name of secularism. This is the reason why parties such as the Muslim League could never occupy much space in national politics.</p>
      <p>The Congress, the CPI(M), the Samajwadi Party, the RJD, the JDU and the TMC were the first choices for a Muslim voter for long. They are said to have been voting for parties that seem to be in a position to defeat the BJP. But their reluctance, of late, to stick to "secular" politics has opened up a huge political opportunity for Owaisi.</p>
      <p>And, he is not reluctant to seek vote by wearing his Muslim identity on his sleeves.</p>
