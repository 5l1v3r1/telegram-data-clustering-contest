      <p>It’s particularly exciting, as it combines my passion for both teaching and wildlife.</p>
      <p>Located on site is an inspiring purpose-built education lodge. The lodge has a great deal of versatility and can accommodate large classes as well as non-school smaller groups and clubs, with groups of up to 30 children. There’s also huge potential for a therapeutic offering here.</p>
      <p>Variety really is the spice of life and I intend to create a new hands-on learning environment that continues to engage and inspire children of all ages. Workshops will be cross-curricular and suit a range of learning styles and abilities. Topics will have a seasonal flavour and include farming and food production, wildlife investigation and horticulture, among others.</p>
      <p>In other news, I attended Madley Harvest Festival to talk to local children about wildlife friendly farming and food production. It was a golden opportunity to introduce them to "Squirm on Inn" – our new wormery! I’m just getting to grips with these wriggly fellows and the children were impressed with their clever antics.</p>
      <p>And if it ever stops raining, we may get a chance to construct our new Turnastone vegetable beds.</p>
