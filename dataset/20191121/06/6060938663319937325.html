      <p>And like all her other roles, Kriti is also going to shine bright with her lead role in the film '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bachchan-Pandey">Bachchan Pandey</a>'. Recently, Bachchan Pandey’s director Farhad Samjhi spoke about Kriti’s role in the film. He said, “I can say this without any qualms that Kriti’s role in the film is better than a parallel hero role. It’s a very meaty role, in fact, any actress wouldn’t have gotten such a role, it is that good.''</p>
      <p>Even Kriti is quite thrilled and beyond excited to be a part of this <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sajid-Nadiadwala">Sajid Nadiadwala</a> production which is slated to release in Christmas 2020. This will be the second time Kriti will be sharing the big screen with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akshay-Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> and her fans would surely be excited to see her yet again in a pivotal role.</p>
