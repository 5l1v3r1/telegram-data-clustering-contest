      <h1>Facebook fraudster sold £500-worth of non-existent items during year-long scam</h1>
      <h2>Lee-Anne Bothick, also known as Dial, flogged the 'goods' to unsuspecting social media users between 2016 and 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sara Nichol</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> fraudster sold non-existent goods to fellow social media users then pocketed the cash.</p>
      <p>Lee-Anne Bothick, also known as Dial, advertised the 'items' for sale on the internet site on seven occasions over a 12-month period, making £500.</p>
      <p>But when the items never turned-up at the buyers' homes, the 32-year-old denied all knowledge of why they hadn't arrived and refused to hand over a refund, a court heard.</p>
      <p>However, her scam was eventually uncovered after reports were made against the mum-of-one and she was arrested following an investigation.</p>
      <p>Now, more than two-years after her last 'sale' in October 2017, Bothick, of Arnold Street, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-tyneside">Boldon Colliery</a>, has pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud by false representation at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">South Tyneside Magistrates' Court</a>.</p>
      <p>Rachael Glover, prosecuting, said the offences happened between December 2016 and October of the following year.</p>
      <p>In total, Bothick pocketed £493.85 by advertising seven non-existent items and refusing to give refunds when she was contacted by the disgruntled buyers.</p>
      <p>District Judge Kate Meek said: "You dishonestly made false representations that you had items to sell via Facebook that didn't exist and you did so intending to make a gain.</p>
      <p>"There is a significant level of trust, even between strangers who are buying and selling, so there is a significant breach of trust in this case.</p>
      <p>"These are serious matters."</p>
      <p>The court heard that Bothick was an alcoholic and had needed the cash to buy booze and fund her addiction.</p>
      <p>It was also noted that she had no previous convictions and hadn't been in trouble since October 2017.</p>
      <p>The case was adjourned until December 18 for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.</p>
      <p>Her solicitor said he would outline full mitigation at that hearing.</p>
