      <p>Salman Khan fans have been eager to finally witness the third franchise of <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/dabangg-3-makers-to-release-chulbul-pandey-gifs-on-whatsapp-instagram-tiktok-other-social-platforms/"><i>Dabangg</i> </a>which stars Sonakshi Sinha and Saiee Manjrekar as his love interest. While Salman Khan’s Chulbul Pandey has already made a lot of noise, looks like <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/salman-khans-dabangg-3-to-be-b-towns-widest-ever-release-surpassing-thugs-of-hindostan-bharat-others/"><i>Dabangg 3</i> </a>might face a roadblock with Star Wars’ final saga, <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/hollywood-2/star-wars-john-boyega-to-star-in-netflixs-rebel-ridge/"><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> </a>clashing at the box office.</p>
      <p>Yes, you heard it right! Star Wars over a period of its multiple instatements, have garnered its loyal fans base in India, and it’s massive. Previously, we’ve seen the kind of storm created by Hollywood flicks like Avengers: Endgame, Joker and Aladdin at the box office and all of it, within this year.

      <p>Meanwhile, one cannot ignore the Salman bhai buzz amongst the Bollywood cine goers. Dabangg along with Chulbul Pandey too has a crazy hype amongst the audiences and with Prabhudheva directing the film and the fusion of South with Kichcha Sudeep becoming a part of the movie, the makers have only turned it a ‘bigger’ magnum opus.</p>
      <p>But wouldn’t the two biggies affect each other at the box office? That’s something that has been worrying the fans and looks like the Salman Khan starrer Dabangg 3 isn’t taking a step back on matter what!</p>
      <p>A source close to Deccan Chronicle opens about the Dabangg 3 VS Star Wars box office clash as, “It is impossible for Salman to change his date again. Star Wars may be preponed in India by a week.”</p>
      <p>Looks like there will be multiple treat at the ticket windows this Christmas as both Star Wars as well as <i>Dabangg 3</i> are scheduled for a December 20th release.</p>
