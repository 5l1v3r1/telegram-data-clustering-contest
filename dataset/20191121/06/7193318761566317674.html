    <meta property="og:description" content="Work-based health insurance is taking a bigger bite than ever out of Oklahoma workers' paychecks, according to a national study released Wednesday. Using data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, The Commonwealth Fund determined that employee-paid premiums and deductibles grew 27% faster than the state's median household income between 2008 and 2018. That means premiums and deductibles now equal 12.3% of median income, compared to 9.7% a decade ago. The statistic does not mean Oklahomans actually spend that much on those two items, since many households do not meet their deductibles every year. According to the study, the average household deductible is almost $3,000 a year, or almost twice what it was"/>
