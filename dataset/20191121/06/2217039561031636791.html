        <b>KUALA LUMPUR : The fallout from ruling coalition Pakatan Harapan's (PH) loss in the Tanjung Piai by-election in Johor continues to make waves.</b>
      </p>
      <p>PH suffered its worst electoral defeat on Saturday since coming to power last May when the opposition scored a more than 15,000-vote majority.</p>
      <p>Following the loss, Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) chief Anwar Ibarhim had to refute rumours that PH leaders were planning to remove Dr Mahathir Mohamad as prime minister after the loss.</p>
      <p>Mr Anwar said: "The ones who raise the vote of no-confidence are only those who want a vote of no-confidence. This is a small group on the sidelines of the parties. Otherwise, it has not been raised."</p>
      <p>He said he would know because he was in daily contact with senior leaders of PH's component parties.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir himself sprang a surprise yesterday. He said he would consider a Cabinet reshuffle to address growing public discontent over his government's handling of the country, days after the stinging by-election loss.</p>
      <h3>PUBLIC COMPLAINTS</h3>
      <p>Dr Mahathir said leaders in his Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia felt a Cabinet reshuffle was needed to address public complaints on issues such as high living costs and the economy.</p>
      <p>"Very likely before Malaysia hosts the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit next year," said Dr Mahathir.</p>
      <p>Admitting that reshuffling would not be a solution to recover the waning popularity of PH, Dr Mahathir said it has to be done anyway.</p>
      <p>He said that the reshuffle should not be "radical" so as to affect the preparations of Malaysia to host Apec.</p>
      <p>"It may be before the Apec summit but I do not want too many changes to take place because we need to make the necessary preparations as this involves many world powers and we need to be prepared.</p>
      <p>"As the prime minister, I am responsible to reshuffle and I will listen to opinion of others. I will give my own views to making the reshuffle," he said.</p>
      <p>"It will not be today or tomorrow as we have to weigh the abilities and achievements of the current ministers. Only after that can I discuss (with component parties) a Cabinet reshuffle.</p>
      <p>"My constraint is that although I am the PM, I have to discuss with the other five component Pakatan parties and I cannot easily make my own decisions to change or drop just anyone," added Dr Mahathir.</p>
      <p>Pakatan is made up of Bersatu, PKR, Democratic Action Party and Parti Amanah Nasional and is partnered by Parti Warisan Sabah.</p>
      <p>He said that the reshuffle may even bring about new problems and therefore, there is much to be weighed.</p>
      <p>"The act of reshuffling is not a solution, it may even be a problem; we have to know the achievements of ministers before we replace them. We need to know what are the capabilities (of the new ones).</p>
      <p>"A Cabinet reshuffle is not a solution to our problems that will recover the position of the government," said Dr Mahathir. - THE STAR, REUTERS</p>
