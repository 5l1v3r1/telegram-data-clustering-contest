      <h3>Michael Owen is backing Arsenal to win by two goals or more against Southampton at The Emirates on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners have been on a difficult run of results to heap pressure on their Spanish manager Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have only managed to win one of their last six league games – a 1-0 win against Bournemouth in north London.</p>
      <p>Emery’s side will have the opportunity to rebuild their form when the Gunners take on struggling Southampton at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>The Saints have lost five of their last six Premier League games, while the south coast club are winless in their last seven top-flight outings.</p>
      <p>Arsenal can ill-afford to drop more points given the eight-point gap between the Gunners and fourth-placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC striker Owen is backing Arsenal to win by two goals or more against Southampton at The Emirates on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“Arsenal had just one shot on target in their latest league defeat on the road at the King Power Stadium and the Gunners have dropped points from winning positions in their last couple of games at the Emirates against Palace and Wolves,” Owen told <i>BetVictor</i>.</p>
      <p>“Unai Emery’s side start the day eight points off fourth place in the table and I think this is a must win game for the Gunners’ boss given Saints sit just one point and one place off the foot of the table.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal have failed to finish in the Premier League’s top four in their last three seasons under Arsene Wenger and his replacement Emery.</p>
      <p>The Gunners ended their first season under the former Paris Saint-Germain manager in fifth position in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Arsenal signed six new players in the summer transfer window but they’ve been unable to elevate the Gunners to another level.</p>
