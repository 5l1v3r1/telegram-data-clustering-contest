      <p>Yash Raj Films will soon announce a few ‘big’ films as they complete 50 years in the industry. <i>Dhoom 4</i> with Akshay Kumar? <i>Tiger 3</i> with Salman Khan? Or something else? Let’s take you to a ride of dream projects we’re looking forward &amp; hoping YRF to announce at the 50th-anniversary event.</p>
      <p>First of all, out of the rumored films, the one that’s most interesting of all is the next installment of <i>Dhoom. Dhoom 4</i> is definitely on the cards but actors from Ranbir Kapoor, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan to Akshay Kumar have been linked with it. The strongest rumor of them all is Akshay starring in the next <i>Dhoom</i> installment.</p>

      <p>Then we’ve <i>Tiger 3</i> but there’s a road in it. Ali Abba’s Zafar during <i>Bharat</i> said that he is working on Tiger 3’s script. But, now the news is that he’ll be seen uniting with Shah Rukh Khan for a film. So, before <i>Tiger</i> <i>3</i>, in all probability, he could be seen doing the SRK film first. Yash Raj Films could back the Ali-SRK film too.</p>
      <p>Hrithik Roshan &amp; Tiger Shroff’s <i>WAR had</i> a climax with an open ending. It hinted at the sequel and the news of the same has been started floating on the internet since then. Tiger’s character witnesses an end in the move and because of that, we might see a new star opposite Hrithik Roshan.</p>
      <p>The news of <i>Bunty Aur</i> <i>Babli</i> <i>2</i> has also been steaming up for months now. It was being said that <i>Gully Boy </i>fame Siddhant Chaturvedi will be seen reprising Abhishek Bachchan’s role in the sequel. It would be interesting to see if YRF talks anything about this sequel.</p>
      <p>The above-mentioned movies aren’t officially confirmed &amp; are just a dream line-up, we moviegoers would love to see next from Yash Raj Films’ slate.</p>
