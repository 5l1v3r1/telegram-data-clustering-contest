      <p>Mike Francesa had a special guest on his WFAN show on Wednesday — his son, Harrison.</p>
      <p>The long-time WFAN host took some time to wish Harrison a happy 13th birthday, and of course, took some time to talk some sports with his youngest son.</p>
      <p>When Mike opened the floor to his son, he had a strong take that would make Dad proud.</p>
      <p>“The Suns are the best team in the NBA,” he said.</p>
      <p>The two shared a nice moment when Mike asked Harrison if he felt “older or wiser” now that he became a teenager.</p>
      <p>“I don’t feel any bit different. I just still felt stupid,” Harrison said with a sheepish smile as the two shared a laugh and a hug.</p>
      <p>Francesa has two other children, Jack and Emily who are 14 and fraternal twins.</p>

      <p>In early November, Francesa, 65 said he will be <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/mike-francesas-huge-career-change-is-nearly-here/">ending his afternoon drive time show in December</a>, revealing that he agreed to a deal with Radio.com.</p>
      <p>He said <a href="https://wfan.radio.com/articles/mike-francesa-wfan-its-time-next-generation">spending time with his family</a> played a crucial factor in his decision.</p>
      <p>“As they go through high school years, I want to be able to get to their games and be a father — and be able to be there for all of their events before they take off for college,” Francesa said. “I have two that are freshman and one that will be in high school next year. They grow up very quick. Before you know it, they’ll all be in college so these are very important years as a father. That’s important to me. It’s like my No. 1 job.”</p>
      <p>Francesa also said he’s “not leaving the Entercom family” and still expects to still be involved with WFAN, as well, but doesn’t know what that will entail.</p>
