      <h1>'Angry Birds' Has Created a "Venting Machine" You Can Punch</h1>
      <h2>You even get a reward afterwards.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:17:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Yeung</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/angry-birds"><i>Angry Birds</i></a> developer <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/rovio">Rovio</a> is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the highly popular mobile game by teaming up with creative firm Droga5 to create a “venting machine” for you to punch and smash.</p>
      <p>Built-in the Brooklyn-based 10xBeta labs, the innovative, giant red vending machine is designed to resemble the game’s most iconic character and lets you vent out all your daily frustrations by punching, shaking, and even shouting at it. To allow this, the “venting machine” is constructed with a soft foam outer shell along with handlebars and a microphone, and features a screen in the front to display “damage” when you attack it. It even has a camera installed to record your venting session, and the clip will be aired on a billboard in Times Square where the machine will be stationed. At the end of your anger-releasing experience, it’ll even give you a small reward that drops down like a regular vending machine.</p>
      <p>For those lucky enough to be in the neighborhood, the <i>Angry Birds</i> “venting machine” will only be available for one day on November 21 from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m., and you can find it in the middle of Times Square in New York City.</p>
