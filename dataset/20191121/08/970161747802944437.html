      <p>Keeping up with everything that’s going on in the world is tough.</p>
      <p>There’s proper news to stay on top of, sports, celebs, and all the goings on of the internet. It can be a bit overwhelming.</p>
      <p>But don’t panic, because we’re here to help.</p>
      <p>You might not have time to know everything that’s happening, but Metro.co.uk is now here to quickly arm you with one essential thing you need to know each day – so you at least have one easy topic for small talk.</p>
      <p>We’ve teamed up with Amazon Alexa to launch our own command.</p>
      <p>It’s pretty simple. If you have access to an Alexa, just ask: ‘Hey Alexa, what do I need to know today?’</p>
      <p>We’ll then give you a recap of one bit of news to know about that day. We’d recommend checking in each morning so you can head into your day prepared for all the office chit-chat by the kettle.</p>

      <p>Some examples of the tidbits we’ve decided you needed to know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The public was divided by Labour’s pledge to offer free broadband in the UK. The internet reacted, with some saying it would kill business and the free market, and others saying internet access is a necessity in 2019. If the policy is adopted, you could have faster broadband for less cost. But as one critic added: ‘what next, free water?’</li>
        <li>A bar in Dubai has made headlines for offering free drinks to women based on how heavy they are. The heavier they weigh, the bigger the bar tab they receive. The vice-president of the bar told Metro.co.uk that the offer is designed to show that ‘it’s good to gain weight’.’</li>
        <li>During Tuesday night’s leaders’ debate, the Conservatives came under fire for rebranding one of their official Twitter accounts ‘Fact Check UK’. This was seen as both provocative and misleading and heavily criticised by their opponents who say the Tory Party are taking the British public for fools. However, some users hit back by changing their accounts to fact check the Tory’s new Fact Check UK account. Unfortunately for Royal Family actor Ralph Little it led to Twitter suspending his account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As you’ll see, we’re delivering a combo of politics, general goings on, and more fun stuff – from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/why-do-young-people-keep-saying-ok-boomer-11009780/">what ok boomer means</a> to why everyone’s suddenly talking about emotional labour.</p>
      <p>Of course, reading all our content will get you feeling informed, but it’s pretty handy to have a quick cheat sheet. We’re here to make sure you’re equipped with the news you need to know about most.</p>
