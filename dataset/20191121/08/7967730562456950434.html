      <h1>Health experts urge caution after Sydney man returns from Samoa with measles</h1>

      <p>A Sydney man who travelled to Samoa recently was diagnosed with measles upon his return, with NSW health authorities urging people to vaccinate before travelling.</p>
      <p>The acting director of the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District, Catherine Bateman-Steel, said that outbreaks of measles in popular tourist destinations means the risk for measles being imported into Australia is high.</p>

      <p>"While the risk of infection is low in fully-vaccinated people, health experts urge anyone who comes into contact with someone who has measles to remain alert for symptoms and seek medical care if they develop," Dr Bateman-Steel said.</p>
      <p>“Symptoms of measles include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck to the rest of the body,” she said.</p>
      <p>“If you develop symptoms please arrange to see your GP as soon as possible, ensuring you ring ahead and do not wait in the waiting room with other patients, as measles is highly contagious."</p>

      <p>Sixteen deaths have been linked to the measles outbreak in the South Pacific nation so far, including a two-year-old boy, and there are around 1200 other suspected cases of the disease. A state of emergency has been declared.</p>
      <p>Dr Bateman-Steel said people at a number of Sydney locations over the past week should watch for symptoms.</p>
      <p>Those locations and times include the Fitness First gym at 2 Market Street, Sydney between 2pm and 7.30pm on Friday, November 15<b>,</b> and the train from Town Hall to Arncliffe at approximately 7pm that evening.</p>
      <p>Anyone who was at the Men's Headquarters hairdresser in Arncliffe between 8am and 9.45am and Nick's Seafood Restuarant at Cockle Bay Wharf between 7.30pm and 11pm on November 16 should also be on alert.</p>

      <p>The man also went to Miranda Medical Centre between 8am and 9am on November 17, and the St George Hospital Emergency Department from 7pm on November 19 until 3am the next morning.</p>
      <p>Dr Bateman-Steel said the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective, with two doses providing lifelong protection in 99 out of 100 people.</p>
      <p>"NSW Health offers free MMR vaccine via GPs for anyone born during or after 1966 who hasn’t already had two doses. If you are unsure whether you have had two doses, it is safe to have<br/>another dose."</p>
      <p>Despite increasing immunisation rates, Department of Health figures show there have been more cases of measles this year than in 2017 and 2018 combined, and the 249 Australian cases are the second-most of any year since the turn of the century.</p>
