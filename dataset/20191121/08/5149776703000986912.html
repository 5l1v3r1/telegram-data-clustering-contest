      <h1>Brexit activist standing in Broxtowe is found guilty of harassing Anna Soubry</h1>
      <h2>Amy Dalla Mura will still be able to contest the general election - but she won't be allowed to visit the constituency</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:02:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Sharman, Stephen Beech</a></address>
      <p>A Brexit activist standing against Anna Soubry in Broxtowe has been banned from the constituency in the run-up to the General Election after being convicted of harassing her.</p>
      <p>However Amy Dalla Mura, 56, will still be allowed to run against the former Conservative MP - now of The Independent Group For Change - in the poll on December 12.</p>
      <p>Sentencing of Dalla Mura, of Hove, East Sussex, was adjourned pending a psychiatric report until December 16, four days after the election.</p>
      <p>She was warned she could be jailed, but was released on strict conditional bail banning her from Broxtowe until after the election.</p>
      <p>Dalla Mura, who is representing the English Democrats party in Broxtowe, was found guilty of one charge of harassment without violence between January and March this year.</p>
      <p>She had harassed Ms Soubry, a firm Remainer, on three separate occasions, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>On January 23 she attended an event where Ms Soubry was speaking, repeatedly interrupting her and live streaming the event on her phone. The meeting was eventually abandoned when she refused to stop.</p>
      <p>On March 14 she held a camera to Ms Soubry’s face and called her a 'traitor' during a BBC Newsnight interview at Westminster’s central lobby. Ms Soubry said she was "still shaken by it" months after the incident, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Eight days later, she was hoping to encounter Ms Soubry outside the Cabinet Office after she learned she was there. She posted online that she was going to "have a word" with her, but Ms Soubry had left before Dalla Mura had got there.</p>
      <p>Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot described Dalla Mura's behaviour as "utterly peculiar" and said that it would be "too risky" to allow her to go to Broxtowe, despite the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>She said: “I was not a little concerned that, despite knowing she had frightened Ms Soubry, Ms Dalla Mura had gone out of her way to stand against her in a constituency that was 200 miles from Ms Dalla Mura’s home, to which she has no connection.</p>

      <p>Describing Dalla Mura's behaviour as "oppressive and unacceptable", the magistrate said her conduct was "driven by anger at Ms Soubry's political views on Brexit" and that she had "caused harassment in the sense of alarm and distress".</p>
      <p>Dalla Mura was told to have no contact with Ms Soubry directly or indirectly, not to go within the constituency of Broxtowe, and not to go around the Palace of Westminster.</p>
      <p>Ms Arbuthonot added: “She can conduct her campaign from elsewhere, but I am not to have her going there. It is too risky.</p>
      <p>"I am not locking her up today. She can do it from home, email. There is simply no reason for her to be there."</p>
      <p>Other conditions attached to Dalla Mura's bail included that she is "not to post or comment on any social media about Anna Soubry with the exception of attacking policies of political parties."</p>
      <p>Ms Arbuthnot said: “The defendant will be able to attack Change UK, but will not be able to refer to Ms Soubry by name.”</p>
      <p>She later said: “I have not decided at all what I am going to do with you. I have not excluded prison.”</p>
      <p>Ms Soubry told the PA news agency: "The reason we've seen a rise in threats is because society is so divided."</p>
      <p>She added: "The problems I've had are because of my views on Brexit."</p>
      <p>She said parts of the media had "actively stoke[d] it up" with language and headlines such as "talking about draining the swamp".</p>
      <h3>Police to deal with harassment 'robustly'</h3>
      <p>Following the case, police said they would deal "robustly" with harassment and abuse of candidates during the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>Detectives from the Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team (PLAIT) – a national unit established by the Met Police following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox - had looked probed the actions of Dalla Mura.</p>
      <p>PLAIT detectives contacted Dalla Mura and invited her on several occasions to attend a voluntary interview at a police station, but she refused.</p>
      <p>Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, a warrant for Dalla Mura’s arrest was issued and she handed herself in to a central London police station on September 6. She was subsequently charged.</p>

      <p>Commander Adrian Usher, who is responsible for the Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team, said: “Police are committed to dealing robustly with incidents of harassment and abuse against anyone when it is a criminal offence.</p>
      <p>"Officers will intervene appropriately where they hear or see breaches of the law.</p>
      <p>“Abuse or intimidation of MPs, or candidates during elections has serious implications for individuals and for our democracy.</p>
      <p>“As with every election, police will work to prevent and detect crime to enable the democratic process to proceed unhindered."</p>
      <p>He added: “Practical guidance has been issued that will help candidates stay safe during the campaign period.</p>
      <p>"Police forces have been in regular contact with their local candidates and their offices to give security briefings, discuss local arrangements and to ensure they have appropriate, proportionate and effective policing and security measures in place.</p>
      <p>“The Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team will be providing its expertise to local forces and election leads.</p>
      <p>"We encourage candidates to immediately report any security concerns to their local police force in order to keep themselves, their staff, families, and members of the public attending surgeries safe.</p>
      <p>"Strong political opinions are no excuse for abuse, harassment or intimidation of members of the public or parliamentarians. Police will treat such allegations seriously and seek to bring offenders to justice – as today’s conviction demonstrates."</p>
      <h3>Other cases involving Ms Soubry</h3>
      <p>This is not the first case of a member of the public targeting Ms Soubry.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/man-who-sent-jo-cox-3544797">a man who sent a "sickening" letter</a> to the MP making reference to the murdered MP Jo Cox been jailed.</p>
      <p>Ms Soubry was sent the post, which read "COX WAS FIRST YOU ARE NEXT", by <b>Alden Bryce Barlow</b>, 55, of Doncaster.</p>
      <p>The letter arrived at Ms Soubry's constituency office in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Broxtowe</a> on October 14 this year and was opened by a member of staff.</p>
      <p>Barlow admitted sending a letter conveying a threatening message and was sentenced to 12 months in jail at Sheffield Crown Court.</p>
      <p>In July so-called Yellow Vest protester, <b>James Goddard</b>, pleaded guilty to calling Ms Soubry a 'Nazi'.</p>

      <p>The pro-Brexit campaigner was <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/man-who-called-anna-soubry-3122604">filmed calling her a Nazi and a traitor</a> outside the Houses of Parliament in December and January.</p>
      <p>Goddard, of Kelvindale Drive, Timperley, Altrincham, avoided jail and was given an eight-week sentence, suspended for a year, after he admitted using disorderly behaviour with the intention of causing harassment, alarm or distress.</p>
      <p>And in June 2018 UKIP supporter <b>David Hall</b> was <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/pensioner-who-sent-threatening-email-1639012">given a suspended sentence by magistrates</a> after admitting sending six grossly offensive messages, including some to Ms Soubry which said she deserved to hang for "treachery" over Brexit legislation.</p>
