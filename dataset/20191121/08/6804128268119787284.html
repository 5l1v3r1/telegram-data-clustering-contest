      <h2>Harry Redknapp has made a big claim about Mauricio Pochettino and Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:47:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:47</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp has made a huge declaration about Mauricio Pochettino, stating that the Argentine boss thought he would be appointed Manchester United manager last year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Pochettino</a> was sacked by <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> on Tuesday evening after a five-year stint in North London and was immediately replaced by Jose Mourinho, with the appointment of the well-travelled boss coming on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>That has left Pochettino out of work for the first time since starting his managerial career with Espanyol, and there is already plenty of speculation around his availability.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/manchester-united">United</a> have been regularly linked with interest in the former Southampton manager and were heavily touted to swoop for his services when Mourinho was sacked at Old Trafford last December.</p>
      <p>In fact, <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/harry-redknapp">Redknapp</a> has gone even further by declaring that Pochettino believed he had landed the position in the North West.</p>
      <p>"I've got to be honest, I think he wanted the Man United job. I think he wanted the Manchester United job last year. I know for a fact that he thought he had the job at United but he didn't get it," he told Sky Sports' The Debate.</p>
      <p>United eventually turned to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, although performances this season have not been up to scratch and there is already plenty of speculation surrounding who his successor could be.</p>
      <p>However, the hunt for Pochettino's services is expected to be fierce, with Bayern Munich attributed with heavy interest following the exit of Niko Kovac, while Real Madrid have been long-term suitors for the South American.</p>
