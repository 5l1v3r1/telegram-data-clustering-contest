      <p>Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan recently filed court documents asking the court to grant the divorce while they hash out a property settlement and custody agreement.</p>
      <p>According to TMZ, they disclosed that they’re both in relationships and it just makes things easier. It also clears the path if they want to remarry.</p>
      <p>According to the new documents filed by Jenna’s lawyer Samantha Spector, the divorce judgment became final Tuesday. So, now they have to work out custody and support issues involving 6-year-old Everly.</p>
      <p>Jenna recently announced she and her new boyfriend, Steve Kazee, are expecting their first child together. Rumors of a coming engagement have been swirling ever since.</p>
      <p>Channing also has moved on and has been dating Jessie J as of late, but things don’t seem to have been moving as fast as they have for Jenna and Steve.</p>
      <p>Jenna filed for divorce a year ago, months after they went public with their split.</p>
