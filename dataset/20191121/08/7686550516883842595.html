      <h1>Class of 99 returns to school for time capsule, and can't find it</h1>
      <h2>No-one remembers where it was buried</h2>

      <p>A group of ex-pupils who returned to their old school to retrieve a time capsule they buried 20 years ago were left baffled - because they forgot where they had put it.</p>
      <p>Staff at Norwich Road Academy, Norfolk, have even dug holes across the site and used metal detectors in a bid to find the capsule.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Hannah Hedingham, 33, organised a school reunion with her class from 1999 and had planned to open the time capsule as a group.</p>
      <p>However, when they went to dig up the time capsule at Norwich Road Academy, Thetford, Norfolk, they realised they had no idea where they buried it.</p>
      <p>Hannah said: "I'm quite adamant I know where it is but other people are also adamant they know where it is.</p>
      <p>"The school has dug up a few holes where we have said: 'Yep it's definitely there', but we just can't find it."</p>
      <p>Hannah says the capsule contains momentoes from 1999 including a VHS tape recording of some of them as teenagers speaking at the school.</p>
