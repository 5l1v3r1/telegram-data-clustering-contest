      <p>"Sweet peas are a good source of glutathione, our body's master antioxidant. Onions are healthy carbohydrates, rich in glucose and good at nourishing our good-gut microbes. Broccoli is a nutritional powerhouse, high in fiber and vitamins A, C, and B6, along with plenty of antioxidant phytonutrients. Edamame is a good source of lean vegetable protein that our brains rely on to function properly. Finally, brewer's yeast is an excellent source of brain-essential choline and vitamin B12. If that weren't enough, these flavors combine to make a knockout of a dish.</p>
      <p>"Ideally, use only organic vegetables. I prefer to cook these al dente, as I like the consistency better than mushy vegetables, and I believe it preserves the veggies' ability to better deliver their nutrients."</p>
