      <p>A culture of indigenous transgender individuals that has been part of southern Mexico's heritage for centuries is primed for global fashion fame thanks to one of the world's top style magazines.</p>
      <p>For the first time in Vogue magazine's more than 120 years of publishing, an indigenous "muxe" will appear next month on the cover of the glossy's Mexican and British editions.</p>
      <p>Muxes, a term probably derived from the Spanish word "mujer" - meaning woman, are generally indigenous individuals assigned as male at birth who identify as different genders and display characteristics from both genders.</p>
      <p>The cover photo features Estrella Vazquez, a tall, lanky 37-year-old indigenous Zapotec muxe wearing a traditional huipil garment with colourful flowers and holding a pink fan in one hand.</p>
      <p>The weaver and designer sees the cover as a sign of receding bigotry in Mexico towards muxes. Historically the country's ingrained Roman Catholic heritage has reinforced anti-gay and anti-transgender prejudice.</p>
      <p>"I think it's a huge step," Vazquez told Reuters in Juchitan city in southern Oaxaca state, home to perhaps the largest muxe (pronounced MOO-she) community.</p>
      <p>"There's still discrimination, but it's not as much now and you don't see it like you once did," she said.</p>
      <p>While muxes are not well known outside Mexico, within the country it is not uncommon to see muxes at gay pride parades or other cultural events.</p>
      <p>No statistics are collected, but the muxe community is thought to number in the hundreds or thousands.</p>
      <p>In August, Vazquez, who had never heard of Vogue, was invited along with a dozen other muxes by the magazine to participate in a photoshoot. Vogue wanted to highlight Oaxaca's indigenous cultures, she said.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is seeing this cover, everyone is congratulating me. I don't know; it's just hard to make sense of the emotions I'm feeling. It almost makes me want to cry," she said.</p>
      <p>Many muxes historically have been caregivers to ageing parents, a role that has given them prestige in families which typically are shaped by Mexico's macho, male-dominated culture.</p>
      <p>Muxes also played a leading role in the aftermath of a massive 8.1 magnitude earthquake that struck Juchitan in 2017, as many worked to dig out trapped family and friends from the rubble, often using their bare hands.</p>
      <p>Vogue, owned by New York-based Conde Nast, publishes more than 20 editions of the magazine around the world with circulation of 24.4 million.</p>
