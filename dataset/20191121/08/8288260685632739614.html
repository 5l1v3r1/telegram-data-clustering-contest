      <h1>British Airways flights chaos at Heathrow and Gatwick amid 'technical issue'</h1>
      <h2>Flights to and from the UK's two busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, appear to be among those affected</h2>

      <p>British Airways flights are disrupted on Thursday morning - due to a "technical issue", the airline said.</p>
      <p>Flights to and from the UK's two busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, appear to be among those affected.</p>
      <p>BA operates flights out of both London transport hubs to a variety of far-flung destinations.</p>
      <p>London Heathrow and London Gatwick are widely used by Brummies aiming to head to the likes of North America and the Far East.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the airline said: "Our teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue which is affecting some of our flights, and we have re-booked customers onto alternative flights and offered hotel accommodation where they have been unable to continue their journeys last night."</p>

      <p>The British Airways spokeswoman then added: "We are very sorry for the disruption to their travel plans."</p>
      <p>Customers were urged to check ba.com for the latest flight information.</p>
      <p>Passengers are also being urged to ensure their contact details are up to date on their booking.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>It is the latest in a series of systems failures suffered by the airline in recent months.</p>
      <p>In August, an IT glitch caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights and disrupted the travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers.</p>
