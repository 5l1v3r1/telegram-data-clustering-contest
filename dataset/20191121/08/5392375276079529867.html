      <p>As the name suggests, the smart battery cases will come packed with an integrated battery that can give you an additional power backup. The case will continue to charge your phone until the case itself runs out of battery. Your iPhone will then make use of its own battery backup. The Cupertino based brand is claiming a massive 50% additional battery life of the iPhone 11 lineup with this case. It is worth mentioning that the new lineup of iPhones already features an excellent battery life. Furthermore, you can see the battery percentage of the smart case by using the companion iOS widget on your device.</p>

In order to charge the case, you can use the USB-PD fast chargers with the lightning connector. Alternatively, the case also supports the Qi wireless charging meaning you can charge your device along with case at the same time.</p>
      <h3>Price, Availability</h3>
