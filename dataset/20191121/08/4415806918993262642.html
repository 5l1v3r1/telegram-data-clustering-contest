      <p>British Airways flights are disrupted due to a “technical issue”, the airline said.</p>
      <p>Flights to and from the UK’s two busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, appear to be among those affected.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the airline said: “Our teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue which is affecting some of our flights, and we have re-booked customers onto alternative flights and offered hotel accommodation where they have been unable to continue their journeys last night.</p>
      <p>“We are very sorry for the disruption to their travel plans.”</p>
      <p>Customers were urged to check ba.com for the latest flight information and ensure their contact details are up to date on their booking.</p>
      <p>It is the latest in a series of systems failures suffered by the airline in recent months.</p>
      <p>In August, an IT glitch caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights and disrupted the travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers.</p>
