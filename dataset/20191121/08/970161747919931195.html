      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> legend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/petr-cech/">Petr Cech</a> has joined skipper Cesar Azpilicueta in wishing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> good luck in his new managerial role despite moving to London rivals <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach, who won three Premier League titles in two spells at Stamford Bridge, was officially announced as Mauricio Pochettino’s successor on Wednesday after the Argentine was axed only five months on from reaching the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Mourinho previously claimed he could never manage Spurs because of his ties to Chelsea, but Cech has no qualms about his former boss moving to a rival.</p>

      <p>‘He’s a great manager,’ said the former keeper, who played under Mourinho for all three of his title wins and is now technical and performance advisor at the club.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously it’s great for the Premier League to welcome back one of the most successful managers in the Premier League in the past 15 years. Obviously we wish him well.’</p>

      <p>Azpilicueta was similarly gracious, telling <i>Sky Sports</i>: ‘I can talk only when Jose was here at Chelsea with us. We won trophies, and now football moves on.</p>
      <p>‘I wish him all the best even though he goes to a rival. I have good memories with him and I have played many times under him and against him.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously when we play against each other we both want to win for our teams, but this is football. I wish him well.’</p>

      <p>Mourinho took charge of his first training session as Spurs boss on Wednesday afternoon having been handed by far the biggest contract in the club’s history.</p>
      <p>He starts his reign away at West Ham on Saturday with Tottenham ranked 14th in the Premier League table and 11 points adrift of the top four, while he will face off against Chelsea for the first time on December 22.</p>
