        <b>A man has been killed and two others injured in a road traffic collision in Tipperary overnight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shortly after 3:00am gardai were called to the scene of a single car collision on the N24 at Killaloan on the outskirts of Clonmel.</p>
      <p>The driver of the car, a man in his 30s, was removed to South Tipperary General Hospital where he has since been pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>Two passengers in the car, a man and woman both in their 20s, were also taken to hospital. Their injuries are not thought to be life threatening.</p>
      <p>The road is currently closed to traffic and local diversions are in place. Garda forensic collision investigators and crime scene examiners have been requested to examine the crash site scene. A report will be forwarded to the local Coroner.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Clonmel Garda Station Superintendent William Leahy said: "From our initial enquiries itâ€™s understood the car, a 05WH registered silver Volkswagen Polo, left the road and struck a wall while travelling from Clonmel in the direction of Carrick-on-Suir."</p>
      <p>Gardai are appealing for witnesses and in particular anyone who travelling on this stretch of road between 2.45am and 3.15am this morning to contact them at Clonmel Garda Station on 052-6177640 or the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111.</p>
