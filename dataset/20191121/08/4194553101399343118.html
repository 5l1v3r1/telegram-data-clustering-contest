      <h1>Athletic journo confirms LFC ‘genuinely interested’ in Leeds star Ben White, dubbed ‘The White Wall’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:46:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool are ‘genuinely interested’ in Leeds United defender Ben White, who is currently on loan at Elland Road from Brighton.</p>
      <p>That’s according to respected Leeds United reporter Phil Hay of the <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1384972/2019/11/20/a-white-wall-how-bielsa-built-the-football-leagues-meanest-defence-around-a-22-year-old-who-is-tempting-liverpool/">Athletic</a>.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been exceptional under Marcelo Bielsa in the Championship, with Leeds conceding just nine goals in 16 games so far in their challenge for promotion.</p>
      <p>White has been the star of the backline, and Hay dubs him ‘The White Wall’ in his article.</p>
      <p>What is interesting about White is the fact he can play either at centre-back or right-back, meaning we could have another Joe Gomez on our hands.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s side is fairly well stocked in the middle of defence, with Gomez and Dejan Lovren providing backup for Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip when everyone is fit – but our fullback drop-off after Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson is fairly huge.</p>
      <p>Perhaps this is a consequence of having the best right-back and the best left-back on the planet – though it would be nice to bring in another versatile defender to bolster the ranks.</p>
      <p>We’ll keep an eye on White’s season, although reckon Brighton will expect big money for his services – as all Premier League sides do nowadays for Englishman.</p>
