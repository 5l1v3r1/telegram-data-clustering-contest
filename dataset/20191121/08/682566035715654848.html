      <p>Cape Town - <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> defender <b>Daniel Cardoso</b> has warned his team-mates against complacency as they prepare to take on <b>Maritzburg United</b> in the <b>Telkom Knockout</b> semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Amakhosi were shocked 1-0 in the Nedbank Cup final last season by GladAfrica Championship side TS Galaxy and Cardoso is determined not to let a poor mentality again prevent Chiefs from claiming their first piece of silverware in four years.</p>
      <p>The Glamour Boys required penalties in both their first-round TKO win over Cape Town City and their quarter-final clash with arch-rivals Orlando Pirates.</p>
      <p>"Playing the bigger teams in the cup is always a better thing because you're more focused. Some players can drop a bit against the smaller teams," Cardoso told <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/soccer/2019-11-20-kaizer-chiefs-star-daniel-cardoso-ja-look-its-a-big-blow/">TimesLive</a>.</p>
      <p>"Like when we played against Galaxy - we thought that was going to be an easy game and they surprised us and the country. So we mustn't go into this match thinking, 'It's Maritzburg - we've got past the two biggest hurdles and we can't take it down a notch.'</p>
      <p>"I think the players know what's at stake - and this is another chance for us to win silverware. We haven't won a trophy in four years. It's not normal for Chiefs. For myself, I haven't won a trophy. Many players here haven't. So I'm sure it's in the back of their minds - just one extra push and we're into the final."</p>
      <p>Chiefs will lock horns with the Team of Choice at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 15:00.</p>
