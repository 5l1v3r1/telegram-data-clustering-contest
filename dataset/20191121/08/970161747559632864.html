      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/great-british-bake-off/">Great British Bake Off</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prue-leith/">Prue Leith</a> has come under fire on Good Morning Britain for suggesting that treats in lunchboxes should be limited to once a week.</p>
      <p>The television judge joined Susanna Reid on the breakfast programme to debate that she thinks schools should ban packed lunches because she believes they contribute to childhood obesity.</p>
      <p>Beginning the debate, Prue said most parents ‘fill lunch boxes with junk’ and said that items with high-fat contents should be restricted.</p>

      <p>However, Susanna noted that Prue might not be in the best position to preach the notion because of her role on the Channel 4 baking show, and asked: ‘Do you not see some conflict in your role as a host of a programme which is all about cake?’</p>
      <p>‘Of course there’s a very obvious one, there I am sugar every day on Bake Off but this is competition,’ Prue clapped back. ‘Nobody is recommending that you do that every day.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘What happens is and what I like about is that most people get into cooking through baking. You start with a brownie or cupcakes, that’s the best way to get into cooking at all.’</p>

      <p>But Susanna continued: ‘So we can’t reduce people to a treat per week because then they wouldn’t cook a full Sunday roast?’</p>
      <p>Prue then cleared up her previous comment, telling the host: ‘I never said you should have a treat a week, I said mothers shouldn’t put a treat into the lunchbox every week, they’re going to get dozens of treats at home.’</p>

      <p>Viewers were conflicted over Prue’s remarks, with many disagreeing with her stance on packed lunches on Twitter.</p>
      <p>‘Should we ban pack lunches? No. If schools are under financial pressure, asking them to find more money to fund meals for all would be ridiculous,’ scorned one.</p>

      <p>Sian Griffiths, who was also debating the topic, shot down Prue’s call for packed lunches to be a thing of the past.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think banning packed lunches is the answer because the real problem is the school food is absolutely terrible,’ she stated.</p>
