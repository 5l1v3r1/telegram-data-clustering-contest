      <p>John Conner III entered the guilty plea to felony charges of criminal exposure to HIV, statutory rape by an authority figure, and solicitation of a minor, Shelby County District Attorney General Amy Weirich said in a news release.</p>
      <p>He appeared on the Lifetime reality TV dance show “Bring It,” which was scheduled to go on trial this week.</p>
      <p>Conner met with the 16-year-old boy on social media website in 2015 when he was 26 years old and had unprotected sex several times with the teenager in the dance teacher’s vehicle, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The two continued to exchange nude photos and text messages about their sexual activity after the teenager joined Conner’s dance team, the Infamous Dancerettes, but he wasn’t aware Conner had been diagnosed with HIV in 2012, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The teenager told his parents in August 2016, about the sexual encounters he had with Conner and said he thought he should be tested after hearing that his dance teacher had HIV. The teenager tested positive for HIV, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>According to prosecutor, Conner has two similar cases pending with sexual partners, ages 17 and 24.</p>
      <p>He is scheduled to be sentenced on December 20, 2019.</p>
