      <p>These are your morning headlines on Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Former British Lion opens up on cancer battle</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former British &amp; Irish Lion player Tom Smith has revealed he is battling stage four colon cancer.</p>
      <p>The Scotland loose-head prop featured in all three Tests against South Africa in 1997 and against Australia in 2001.</p>
      <p>Forty-eight-year-old Smith won the Five Nations with Scotland in 1999.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/50395820">Speaking to the BBC</a> , he said: "I played rugby for 15 years professionally. Aches and pains are part of the deal as you get older. I think I wrote it off until it got to the point that I needed to do something.</p>
      <p>"I try to get on with things and that's probably my downfall."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Barbarians see off Brazil</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Barbarians have prepared for their clash with Wayne Pivac's Wales with a comfortable 47-22 win over Brazil in Sao Paulo.</p>
      <p>The invitational side, coached by Eddie Jones, only led by four points at the turnaround, but pulled away in the second period.</p>
      <p>The Baa-Baas now head to Cardiff to provide the opposition for Pivac's first game in charge of the Welsh national side a week on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Mark McCall, Saracens director of rugby, says their players will be available to Eddie Jones for the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>The England coach had expressed fears that Saracens stars could choose to help their club side try to overcome their docked points for breaching salary cap rules.</p>
      <p>But McCall says that won't be the case.</p>
      <p>"I genuinely want our players to play for England. Of course I do, it's the absolute pinnacle of the game," he said.</p>
      <p>"Wanting to play in the Six Nations doesn't mean you're not committed to the club.</p>
      <p>"All of these guys are 100 per cent committed to Saracens, but playing for your country is playing for your country and I would support that every time."</p>
      <p>On their current situation, McCall added: "We are going to concentrate on the rugby and getting back to what we do well. It is definitely a tough challenge, there's no doubt about that.</p>
      <p>"But the squad is very tight, the squad is very together, the squad is very united. They are delighted to be back together again. There is a great atmosphere around the place."</p>

        <b>Wilson appointment may have ruffled feathers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Glasgow player Colin Gregor says a number of Scottish rugby coaches may have been "rubbed up the wrong way" by Danny Wilson's appointment with the Warriors.</p>
      <p>Ex-Cardiff Blues man Wilson will succeed Australia-bound Dave Rennie at the end of the season</p>
      <p>Gregor believes the decision may not have been universally welcomed.</p>
      <p>"I find it disappointing," Gregor said.</p>
      <p>"There has been a lot of talk about the development of young Scottish coaches, especially former players. Mike Blair [at Glasgow] is your perfect example.</p>
      <p>"With only two professional teams in Scotland, opportunities to be a head coach are few and far between.</p>
      <p>"Of the coaches working under Gregor Townsend it's interesting that he's [Wilson] the one chosen to lead up Glasgow Warriors rather than, say, a Matt Taylor who's been alongside Gregor a long time. He's developed as a coach in Scotland - did he not want and would he not be suitable for that head role?</p>
      <p>"These guys are ambitious about their individual coaching careers so, yes, they probably have been rubbed up the wrong way.</p>
      <p>"You also look at John Dalziel who is currently at Glasgow Warriors with the forwards and has not long left the 7s to take over that role. Where does he now fit with a former forwards coach being the head coach?"</p>
