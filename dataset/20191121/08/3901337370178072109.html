      <p>In an interview with <i>Sportsmail's</i> Piers Morgan, former England international Peter Crouch revealed something of his national team teammates, who played for Manchester United at the time, reveaed to him about Ronaldo. </p>
      <p>The former Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool striker explained how the United players would tease the Portugal star about his rivalry with Messi, to which he once made a witty comeback.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to some of the United players and said 'what’s Ronaldo like?'" Crouch started. </p>
      <p>"... And they said they used to wind him up by saying Messi was better than him and he said: 'Yeah, but Messi doesn't look like this (him)'. </p>

      <p>Crouch later went on to choose which one of the two global superstars he believes is the greatest of all time, naming Messi ahead of Ronaldo. </p>
      <p>"Ronaldo's record is ridiculous. He averages over a goal a game in like 500 games," Crouch added.</p>
      <p>"... I admire his determination and mentality and his single-mindedness, but if you’re talking gifted footballers, there is no comparison to Messi."</p>
