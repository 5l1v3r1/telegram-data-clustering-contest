      <p>WASHINGTON â€” <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/fiat/">Fiat</a> Chrysler Automobiles said on Thursday it will recall nearly 700,000 <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/suv/">sport utility vehicles</a> worldwide because a faulty electrical connection could prevent engine starts or contribute to a stall.</p>
      <p>The recall, covering 2011 through 2013 model year <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/durango/">Dodge Durango</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/grand+cherokee/">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> SUVs, will address silicon deposits on the contact points of fuel pump relays that may interrupt electrical current, Fiat Chrysler said in a statement. It said it is unaware of any injuries or accidents related to the faulty vehicles.</p>
      <p>The Italian-American automaker had previously <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/recalls/">recalled</a> most of the same SUVs in 2014 and 2015 for issues with their fuel pump relays.</p>
      <p>The company, which last month announced it planned to merge with <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/peugeot/">Peugeot</a> owner PSA, said it would notify owners at a later date when they will be able to schedule <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/auto-repair/">repairs</a> at <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/car-dealers/">dealerships</a>.</p>
      <p>The recall includes around 528,500 vehicles in the United States, 34,700 in <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/canada/">Canada</a>, 18,100 in Mexico and 116,500 outside North America, it said.</p>
