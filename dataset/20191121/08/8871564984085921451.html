      <p>A Sumatran elephant has been found dead from an apparent poisoning, an Indonesian conservation official said Thursday, in the second killing of the critically endangered subspecies this week.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old female elephant’s corpse was discovered at a palm oil plantation in East Aceh regency Thursday, hundreds of kilometres from where another was found decapitated and with its tusks ripped off on Monday — a suspected poaching case.</p>
      <p>“Our initial findings found that the Sumatran elephant was allegedly killed by poison,” said Rosa Rika, a doctor with Aceh’s conservation agency.</p>
      <p>The dead elephant’s stomach contents would be analysed to confirm its cause of death, she added.</p>
      <p>Last year, a Sumatran elephant was found <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/sumatran-elephant-found-dead-missing-tusks-indonesia/">dead from poisoning</a> in another part of the region, after several similar cases in recent years.</p>
      <p>Rampant deforestation to create plantations has reduced Sumatran elephants’ natural habitat and brought them into conflict with humans, while their tusks are also prized in the illegal wildlife trade.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, some three dozen wild elephants stormed into a village in Aceh, destroying two homes.</p>
      <p>Last month, Aceh said poachers who threatened endangered animals in the province could receive up to 100 lashes starting from next year. The conservative region administers public whippings for a range of offences under local Islamic law.</p>
      <p>Indonesia’s environment ministry estimates there are fewer than 2,000 Sumatran elephants still in the wild.</p>
