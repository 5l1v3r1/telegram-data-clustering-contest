      <h1>Destiny 2: The Collection gets rated for PC and consoles, but Bungie says it’s Stadia exclusive for now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:48:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>Bungie has revealed that despite a rating for Destiny 2: The Collection popping up for PC and consoles, the complete edition isn’t actually coming to those platforms.</p>
      <p><b>Destiny 2: The Collection</b> is a version of the game that’s exclusive to Stadia. Google bundles it <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/18/google-stadia-launch-games-22-free-samurai-shodown/">as part of Stadia Pro memberships</a>, but it has strangely been missing from other platforms.</p>
      <p>This week, a flurry of <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=destiny+2&amp;op=Search&amp;filter-age%5B%5D=&amp;filter-descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;filter-publisher=&amp;filter-platform%5B%5D=&amp;filter-release-year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-iTc3155IqwBRdHtNZK8tEeWV-ZE0teMF0veE6rEzQ0E&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">PEGI ratings</a> appeared for the bundle, for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. The Collection is essentially a complete edition of Destiny 2. It includes all year one content and add-ons, Forsaken and its DLC, as well as Shadowkeep and the current season pass.</p>
      <p>All of the content in The Collection can be accessed on all platforms where Destiny 2 is available, but you’ll need to make separate purchases. When asked about the PEGI ratings, Bungie told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/stadias-destiny-2-the-collection-has-been-rated-for-pc-and-consoles/">GamesRadar</a> it has no plans to bring it to platforms other than Stadia.</p>

      <p>Bungie also said that it’s “pretty easy to find ways to be content complete” on these platforms. While that’s technically correct, players were hoping Destiny 2: The Collection would have some kind of discount to make it a bit cheaper than buying all that content individually.</p>
      <p>Since it’s free to Stadia Pro players – the only people who can access the service today – The Collection does not have a price on Stadia’s store. When it does, there may not be any savings worth worrying about.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, that type of collection is typically what comes out ahead of the release of new content, so Destiny 2: The Collection will more likely arrive on other platforms sometime next year.</p>
      <p>For now, if you’re looking to get the same content without the name, you’ll need to buy Forsaken and its annual pass for $25, as well as Shadowkeep and its annual pass for $60 – a total of $85.</p>
