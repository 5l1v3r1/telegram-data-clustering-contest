        <b>Hindi Livinus, Yola</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gunmen on Tuesday night abducted the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Mubi North, divisional command in Adamawa State Ahidjo Mohammed.</p>
      <p>This came after a  resident of Mubi, a trader, Alhaji Mahmudu Mbilla, from Mbilla village had been abducted by gunmen that day.</p>
      <p>The DPO’s kidnap, which was confirmed by the police, occurred around Maraba Mubi.</p>
      <p>The police officer was said to have been abducted after the hoodlums ambushed the vehicle he was travelling in.</p>
      <p>Ahidjo was said to have been on his way back from Mubi, where he had gone to visit his sick mother at an undisclosed hospital in Yola when the incident took place.</p>
      <p> The gangsters were said to have shot indiscriminately before whisking him away.</p>
      <p> Mbilla’s abductors have allegedly demanded N50m for his release.</p>
      <p>Spokesman for the police in the state, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, who confirmed the kidnap of the DPO, said the Anti-Kidnapping Special Unit under the Office of the Inspector-General of Police had launched a  manhunt for the abductors of the cop.</p>
      <p>Nguroje said,  “The officer was kidnapped at  Mararaba Mubi. When the police   reached the area they found the vehicle carrying him (DPO) abandoned with his identity card left behind.”</p>
      <p>Although the police denied the abductors of the DPO had yet to demand any money for his release, sources said the hoodlums contacted his family, demanding  N50m.</p>
      <p>The state Commissioner of Police, Audu Madaki,  told our correspondent on the telephone that he was at  a meeting and that he would get back to him.  But had yet to respond as of the time of filing this report.</p>
