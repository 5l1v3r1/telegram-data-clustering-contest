      <p>Dewan and Tatum, who have a daughter Everly who is aged 6 had announced their split in April 2018 after eight years of marriage.</p>
      <p>The finalization of their divorce comes weeks after Dewan and her new boyfriend, Broadway star Steve Kazee, announced that she is pregnant with their first child.</p>
      <p>The two stepped out as a couple last November, a week after the actress filed for divorce from Tatum, who is reportedly dating Jessie J.</p>
      <p>When Tatum filed for divorce in October 2018, both she and Tatum agreed to share a joint legal and physical custody of their daughter, who they have been co-parenting amid their separation.</p>
      <p>No details about the final custody arrangements have been released yet.</p>
