      <p>Royal Mail has warned that the company’s transformation programme is “behind schedule”, despite improving profits and revenues over the past six months.</p>
      <p>The delivery giant also fired a warning shot to unions over the continued threat of strike action, saying industrial action “can only hurt” the company.</p>
      <p>The firm updated investors over the performance of the business just a week after it secured an injunction to block postal workers from taking part in strike action.</p>
      <p>In the trading update, the London-listed company warned that the UK business could make a loss in the 2020-2021 financial year, due to revenue and costs headwinds as well as significant investment by the company.</p>
      <p>However, Royal Mail hailed its best UK sales performance for the “past five years” but warned the outlook for its letters business is “challenging”.</p>
      <p>The delivery giant saw revenues rise 5.1% to £5.16 billion in the half year to September 29.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it jumped to £173 million pre-tax profit, up from a £33 million profit for the same period in 2018.</p>
      <p>Rico Bank, group chief executive, said the company’s profitability has been “in line with expectations for the half year, despite considerable UK economic and political uncertainty”.</p>
      <p>The company said revenues from its letters business are the “best in five years” but still reported a 1.4% decline in the division.</p>
      <p>It also cautioned that a slump in business confidence is expected to have an impact on letters volumes over the next year.</p>
      <p>Parcel revenues more than offset the decline in the letters arm, with sales increasing 5.6% on the back of a 5% jump in parcel volumes.</p>
      <p>Mr Back said: “People are posting fewer letters and receiving more parcels. We have to adapt to that change.</p>
      <p>“The challenging financial outlook in the UK means now, more than ever before, we need to make the changes required – and accelerate them – to ensure a successful UK business.</p>
      <p>“We remain committed to investing £1.8 billion in our transformation. We want to change, working with our unions, but we can only do so through an affordable resolution.”</p>
      <p>Last week, the firm won an injunction from the High Court to block potential strikes by postal workers but the CWU union has said it will appeal the decision.</p>
      <p>In its half-year report, the company said that “industrial action, or the threat of it, can only hurt our company, and our colleagues”.</p>
      <p>It added: “That is because, in today’s postal market, our customers have choices. Consumers can send a text or email when they would once have written a letter; and shippers can choose from a wide range of delivery companies, not just Royal Mail.”</p>
