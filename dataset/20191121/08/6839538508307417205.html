      <p>The City of Fremantle will shell out half a million in back pay to underpaid staff but won’t pursue an estimated $180,000 in over payments it made to other employees.</p>
      <p>Twenty-seven workers were overpaid by the City but a spokesman said it did not intended to recover the cash.</p>
      <p>“As the overpayments were the result of an error by the City, and it’s likely those funds would have already been spent or committed, it was considered it would be unfair on staff to ask them to repay the overpayments,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The total amount of the overpayments is estimated to be in the vicinity of $180,000.”</p>
      <p>At the same time the local government will hand out $564,949 in back pay owed to 143 casual and shift workers because of underpayments dating back six years.</p>
      <p>The errors were discovered by the City during recent negotiations for the local government’s workforce agreement.</p>
      <p>Confusion over how to interpret shift penalty and leave entitlement clauses were cited as the reason for the under-payments.</p>
      <p>Fremantle acting chief executive Paul Garbett said all affected staff had received back pay or were getting the leave entitlement they were owed.</p>
      <p>“As soon as we became aware of this issue, the City’s focus has been on making sure we resolve it as quickly and thoroughly as possible,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The City has also identified that up to 27 employees have been overpaid ... these employees are not required to repay the overpayment.”</p>
      <p>About $38 million was allocated to employee costs for the City’s 2019-20 budget.</p>
      <p>The local government’s spokesman said back payments would be absorbed into the budget through “incremental adjustments across all of the City’s operations”.</p>
      <p>Former employees who think they have been affected by the underpayment should call the City at 1300 693 736.</p>
