      <p>The Los Angeles Clippers saw off the Boston Celtics in what many believe could be a dress rehearsal of the NBA finals.</p>
      <p>With marquee signings Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in tandem for the first time, the Clippers were 107-104 winners after overtime.</p>
      <p>It was the league’s highest-scoring sixth man of all time, Lou Williams, who led the way for LA with 27 points, but George chimed in with 25 and Leonard 17.</p>
