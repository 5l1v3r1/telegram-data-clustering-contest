      <h1>1 in 10 Brits lie about donating to charity</h1>
      <h2>Sainsbury's and Argos are running the ‘Help Brighten a Million Christmases’ campaign, which encourages people to make food and toy donations</h2>

      <p>When was the last time you gave a charity donation? Research suggest that Brits forget to make donations, despite 85% agreeing that it's important to donate to a good cause.</p>
      <p>A study of 1,000 UK adults found 40% have forgotten to make a charity donation and 31% even lied about making donations in order to show off to another person.</p>
      <p>The study also found that 1 in 4 couldn't afford to give to charity, while 3 in 10 said they simply didn't have the time to make a donation.</p>
      <p>However, 95% of people have donated at some point in their lives, whether this be in monetary form or by giving clothing and books to charity.</p>
      <p>In fact, nearly half all Brits surveyed said donating makes them feel happy and 3 in 10 think they're more likely to be charitable at Christmas than any other time of year.</p>

      <p>However, Sainsbury's and Argos have launched a new scheme that makes it much easier for people to be charitable, as 33% of people surveyed said they would be more inclined to donate to charity if the process was simpler.</p>
      <p>The 'Help Brighten a Million Christmases' campaign encourages the UK public to donate items to charity; Sainsbury's is collecting food items while Argos is asking for toy donations.</p>
      <p>Judith Batchelar, Director of Sainsbury's Brand, said: "If every person shopping at any supermarket this December bought one extra item – be that a can of soup or a roll-on deodorant – over 50 million products could be donated to those in need this festive season.</p>
      <p>“We’ll be kicking off donations by giving a basket of priority items in every one of our 2,300 stores today".</p>
      <p>Best of all, you don't need to shop at Sainsbury's to be part of the scheme as they will be "welcoming products from any other retailer placed in our collection boxes, so everyone can come together to help Brighten a Million Christmases again this year".</p>
      <p>In partnership with thousands of charities, all items collected will be distributed around local communities and families that need them, all in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's will also be providing weekly updates on the priority items that food banks need the most.</p>
      <p>What should I donate?</p>
      <p>Food banks and charities are looking for a variety of items for the Christmas season, whether this be food to eat on Christmas day or toys for young children to unwrap.</p>
      <p>Argos is also looking for some toy donations; 40% of parents will de clutter their children's toys before Christmas, with 7 in 10 donating these old toys and games to a greater cause.</p>
      <p>1 in 4 said their children are eager to donate their old toys to those in need.</p>
