      <h1>Singapore deports Hong Konger over protest discussion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:40:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Singapore has deported a Hong Kong YouTube star after he organized a small gathering to <a href="https://coconuts.co/singapore/news/singapore-probes-hong-kong-born-youtuber-over-protest-discussion/">discuss the protests</a> convulsing his home city in violation of public assembly laws, police said today.</p>
      <p>The city-state’s elite are increasingly nervous about the unrest in rival financial hub Hong Kong, observers say, as they fear it could inspire demonstrations in the tightly-controlled country where protests are rare.</p>
      <p>Police launched a probe after Alex Yeung, a pro-Beijing restaurateur known for his anti-protest tirades on YouTube, organized the gathering last month in a bar with a handful of people, mostly Hong Kongers.</p>
      <p>Organizing a public assembly without a police permit in Singapore is punishable by a fine of up to S$5,000 (US$3,700). Repeat offenders can be fined up to S$10,000 or jailed for a maximum of six months or both.</p>
      <p>But after wrapping up their probe, police decided to give Yeung only a warning and sent him back to Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“Singapore has always been clear that foreigners should not advocate their political causes in Singapore, through public assemblies, and other prohibited means,” said a police statement.</p>
      <p>In a video posted after police launched a probe, Yeung had accused supporters of the protests of setting him up at the gathering.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been shaken by nearly six months of increasingly violent demonstrations, with protesters calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month that Singapore would be “finished” if similar protests erupted there.</p>
      <p>“It will become impossible to govern Singapore, to make and carry out difficult decisions or to plan for the long-term good of the nation,” he said.</p>
