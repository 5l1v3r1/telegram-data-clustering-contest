      <p>Yikes, guys. Country superstar Sam Hunt was reportedly arrested early this morning and charged for driving under the influence and being in possession of an open container. The “House Party” singer was allegedly driving the wrong way down a road in Nashville, according to <i><a href="https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/country-star-sam-hunt-arrested-for-dui-in-east-nashville/">WKRN</a></i>. Police also observed the driver reportedly swerving in and out of his lane and claimed Sam had “difficulty providing his Tennessee license.”</p>
      <p><i>E! News</i><i>,</i> <i><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/11/21/sam-hunt-dui-arrest-wrong-way-nashville-east-police/4259019002/">USA Today</a></i><i>,</i> and <i>WKRN</i> all reported that Sam’s blood alcohol level was 0.173 (the legal limit is 0.08). According to each outlet, he also allegedly told police he had consumed alcohol “recently.”</p>
      <p>The police who were present at the scene had reported to <i>WKRN </i>that the musician had a strong alcohol scent and appeared to have bloodshot eyes. Authorities also found two empty beer bottles next to Sam.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old entered the Metro jail around 6:30 a.m. and was released around 9 a.m. on a $2,500 bond. A court date has been set for January 17, 2020, although <i>USA Today</i> noted it’s not clear if he has legal representation yet.</p>
      <p>Sam rose to fame with hits like “Body Like a Back Road,” “Break Up in a Small Town,” and “Take Your Time.” He married his wife, Hannah Lee Fowler, in April 2017, and the two don’t share any children.</p>
