      <p>The decision not to reverse a Pat Cummins wicket for an apparent no-ball has baffled a host of Australia legends during the first Pakistan Test.</p>
      <p>Ashes star Cummins had Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Muhammad Rizwan caught behind shortly after tea at the Gabba but Australia’s celebrations were muted as the third umpire was told to check for a front-foot no-ball.</p>
      <p>The replays appeared to show Cummins’ heel landing on rather than behind the line but, much to the surprise of the star-studded commentary team, third umpire Michael Gough upheld the on-field decision.</p>

      <p>Ex-Australia captain Allan Border said: ‘I’m trying to find something behind (the line) there but I just can’t.’</p>

      <p>Legendary bowlers Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie and former skipper Ricky Ponting agreed that the decision should have been reversed.</p>
      <p>‘I think that’s the wrong call. I think it’s a no-ball and should be recalled,’ Gillespie said on ABC Radio.</p>

      <p>Lee, speaking on Fox Cricket, added: ‘I reckon that’s hard on Pakistan, I think that’s got to be called a no-ball.</p>
      <p>‘You won’t often hear me say this, but that’s got to go to the batsman.’</p>
      <p>Ponting, meanwhile, said: ‘I couldn’t see any part of his foot land behind the line.’</p>
      <p>Cummins finished the day with three wickets as Australia bowled Pakistan out for 240 at the Gabba.</p>
      <p>Pakistan’s Asad Shafiq top-scored with 76 but Mitchell Starc’s 4-52, Cummins’ 3-60 and Josh Hazlewood’s 2-46 helped the hosts dominate on day one in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>The second match of this two-Test series takes place in Adelaide.</p>
