      <p>VOLUNTEERS and representatives of WA Police will pass an Olympic torch through Joondalup on Tuesday, December 3, to celebrate International Day of People with Disability and support the work of the Special Olympics.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.letr.org/"> Law Enforcement Torch Run</a> is a global movement to promote inclusion and diversity and raise awareness of the Special Olympics, which supports athletes with intellectual disabilities to encourage participation in a range of sports to reach personal goals.</p>
      <p>Led by the WA Police Pipe Band, the Joondalup event will see about 40 police officers and cadets and 12 Special Olympic athletes volunteering to take part in a torch run from 10am, starting at Joondalup Police Station, through North Metropolitan Tafe, the WA Police Academy, and ending at ECU.</p>

      <p>Members of the community with a disability are then invited to join a “try-a-sport” event at the ECU grassed area in front of Building 1, which will include soccer skills, bocce and short tennis and team games.</p>
      <p>There will also be an opportunity to share ideas for inclusion in the community, while showcasing the abilities of some of the Special Olympics athletes.</p>
      <p>“Known as Guardians of the Flame, police officers carry a torch – ‘the flame of hope’ – symbolising courage, diversity and hope for inclusion for all,” Law Enforcement Torch Run secretary Delia Newman said.</p>
      <p>“As we move along, we chant and wave flags to direct attention to encourage inclusion and hope the members of the community will support us along the route.”</p>
