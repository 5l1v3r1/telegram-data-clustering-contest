      <p>As shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.</p>
      <p><b>Winter warmers<br/></b>From oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.</p>
      <p><b>Board games<br/></b>Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, divide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.</p>

      <p><b>Bestselling books<br/></b>Alongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.</p>
      <p><b>Chintzy china<br/></b>From cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?</p>

      <p><b>Classic records<br/></b>With vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.</p>
      <p><b>Brand-new clothes<br/></b>We all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.</p>
      <p><b>Vintage sewing patterns<br/></b>More than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.</p>
      <p><b>Statement jewellery<br/></b>You don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.</p>
      <p><b>Toiletry gift sets<br/></b>Once a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.</p>
