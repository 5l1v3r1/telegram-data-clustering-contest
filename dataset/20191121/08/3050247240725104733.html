      <h3>Analysts eye $7,500 and $6,500 floors for BTC</h3>
      <p>Analysts had widely predicted the bearish move, with regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a> recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-in-golden-pocket-as-trader-warns-of-7-400-breakdown">eyeing $7,400</a> as a realistic new support zone for Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Continuing the forecast, fellow contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/filbfilb">filbfilb</a> highlighted even lower levels — $6,500 or the pivotal profitability price for miners — as the ultimate floor if bearish sentiment continued. Before that, the 100-week moving average (WMA) at $7,520 could provide further support.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-will-defend-price-above-6-500-ahead-of-halving-analyst">reported</a>, $6,500 is considered by many commentators as the lowest possible Bitcoin price under current conditions. </p>
      <p>“Still think the 100 WMA will hold up at this stage, but if it doesn’t, I’m all in at $6,500,” filbfilb said in private comments.</p>
      <p>On Monday, statistician <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/willy-woo-8k-bearish-bitcoin-price-in-unique-setup-before-halving">Willy Woo</a> forecast that current Bitcoin price behavior would remain “unique” compared to previous cycles in its history. Specifically, BTC/USD would approach its 2020 block reward halving on bearish sentiment. In 2012 and 2016, halvings followed at least six months of bullish progress.</p>
      <p>Woo additionally predicted that volatility would remain a feature for Bitcoin in the coming months.</p>
