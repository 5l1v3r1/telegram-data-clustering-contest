      <h2>The retailer is no longer exclusively a poundstore after ditching it's across-the-board £1 price pledge on a range of goods.</h2>

      <p>Budget retailer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/seven-weird-things-youve-probably-19570391">Poundland</a> has ended its across-the-board £1 price pledge with the introduction of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/shopping">products</a> ranging from 50p to £5 in every UK store.</p>
      <p>The move follows a trial in 24 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/seven-weird-things-youve-probably-19570391">West Midlands</a> stores, two years after introducing £2 and £5 prices in stores nationwide.</p>
      <p>It said the rollout would enable it to deliver a "broader range of items at simple prices in three key categories - household goods, health and beauty, and grocery".</p>
      <p>The new pricing applies to selected lines, and three-quarters of products will continue to sell for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/seven-weird-things-youve-probably-19570391">£1</a> .</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/poundland-now-selling-halloween-invisibility-20557720">Poundland</a> managing director Barry Williams said: "We've introduced simple pricing in time for Christmas so we can offer customers even more choice and even better value for money.</p>
      <p>"Our shoppers love the amazing value we provide and now we can begin bringing that value on wider ranges that they now can find in stores for the first time."</p>
      <p>Examples of the new pricing include Matchmakers for 75p, Walkers 24 packs of crisps for £3, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/seven-weird-things-youve-probably-19570391">L'Oreal Elvive Fibrology</a> shampoo for £2, Comfort Blue Skies fabric conditioner for £4, and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/seven-weird-things-youve-probably-19570391">Nivea Men Fresh Power</a> 0% deodorant for £1.50.</p>
      <p>Poundland earlier said it was transforming itself to be a "simple price retailer", rather than sticking with its ethos of selling products at one single price.</p>
