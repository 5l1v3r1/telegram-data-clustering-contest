      <p>SEOUL, Nov 21 — North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has rejected an invitation by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to a regional summit next week, Pyongyang’s state media said today, in a stark illustration of the dire relations between the neighbours.</p>
      <p>South Korea is due to host a summit with South-east Asian leaders in its port city of Busan from next Monday, and Moon had previously expressed hope that Kim would attend.</p>
      <p>Kim received a personal letter from Moon on November 5, North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, but dismissed the prospect of the leader attending the summit.</p>
      <p>In a commentary, it accused the South of failing to carry out agreements reached between the two Koreas and harming cross-border ties by relying on the United States.</p>
      <p>“How can we sit face to face and solve things with such a partner entrusting everything to the outsider without any independence and self-standing attitude,” the agency said.</p>
      <p>Given the failure of past summits, a North-South meeting for “mere form’s sake would be pointless”, it added.</p>
      <p>KCNA said Seoul had asked Pyongyang to send a special envoy if Kim could not attend.</p>
      <p>Moon, who has long championed engagement with nuclear-armed Pyongyang, held three meetings with the North Korean leader last year and brokered the first landmark summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>But contact between the two Koreas stalled after the collapse of a second Trump-Kim summit in February.</p>
      <p>Since then, Pyongyang has excoriated its neighbour over joint military drills with the United States and has suspended virtually all inter-Korean cooperation in recent months.</p>
      <p>Negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington over the North’s nuclear weapons have been gridlocked since the February summit collapsed without an agreement.</p>
      <p>North Korea has since set Washington a deadline of the end of the year to come forward with a fresh offer and has issued several statements in recent weeks threatening to pull out of talks. — AFP</p>
