      <p>Whether you know him as David Adeleke, Omo Baba Olowo (O.B.O) or Davido, the same thing comes to mind, he is a superstar.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian music star who was born on this day in 1992 has come a long way since he came into the spotlight in 2011 with his hit song, Dami Duro.</p>
      <p>From chart topping songs, international deals, setting music records to what have you, he has worked his way up the ladder of success and now sits comfortably as one of Africa’s biggest and most celebrated entertainer.</p>
      <p>At 27, the singer has amassed a fortune that many his age can only dream of and from the look of things, he has no plans to quit any time soon.</p>
      <p>To celebrate his 27th birthday, we take a look at some of his major achievements thus far.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Multiple Award-winner</b>
      </p>
      <p>Davido has several notable awards to his name and considering how hard he works, this is no surprise. He is the recipient of 2 BET Awards, a Kora Award, a Channel O Music Video Award, a Ghana Music Award, a Nigeria Music Video Award, 2 MTV Africa Music Awards, 2 African Muzik Magazine Awards, 5 The Headies Awards, 7 Nigeria Entertainment Awards and 2 Dynamix All Youth Awards to name but a few.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Reign of ‘Fall’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Late in 2018, news filtered into that Davido’s mega hit song, ‘Fall’ released the year before had become the <a href="https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/music/davidos-fall-climbs-to-no-1-position-on-the-shazam-new-york-city-us-charts/dym4n7b">most Shazamed song by New York</a> listeners following sustained spins on local radio stations. This led to listeners getting curious and asking, who is Davido? ‘Fall’ also surfaced on the Billboard charts and is constantly rising with every week, recently climbing to the 29th position on the charts, later becoming the <a href="https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/music/davidos-fall-is-longest-billboard-charting-nigerian-song/wc9drqw">longest charting Nigerian song</a> spending over four weeks on the charts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>First African To Perform At Music of Black Origin Awards (</b>
        <b>MOBO)</b>
      </p>
      <p>On November 30, 2017, Davido won the Best African Act at the MOBO Awards and also became the first African act to perform live at the awards. He had to beat out the likes of Maleek Berry, Tekno, Mr Eazi, Tiwa Savage, Wande Coal and Wizkid who were also nominated in the category.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BET Award</b>
      </p>
      <p>On June 24, 2018, Davido became the first African-based artist to have received his award on the BET Awards main stage.</p>
      <p><b>The Uplifter<br/></b>If there is one thing everyone loves about Davido outside of his music, it is his large heart. The singer is known to be extremely kind and loving towards those close to him and he has helped bring to limelight some other Nigerian stars. From Kiddominant, Peruzzi MC Galaxy, Humblesmith, Mayorkun and even his fiancee, Chioma. Ether through collaborations, working together or simply by association, he has brought fame to the aforementioned and many others.<br/><b>Sold out global concert venues<br/></b>Not many Nigerian musicians can boast of selling out shows abroad but Davido has no doubt taken his music across the borders of Nigeria as he has sold out several concert venues overseas.</p>
