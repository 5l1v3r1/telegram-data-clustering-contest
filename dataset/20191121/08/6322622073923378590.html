      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 21): Petronas Dagangan Bhd's share price fell the most among the 30 FBM KLCI stocks in afternoon trades today after the KLCI's early plunge below the 1,600-point level, as US-China trade spat uncertainties hit world markets.</p>
      <p><i>Reuters </i>reported that global stocks took a beating on Thursday, as a fresh row between Washington and Beijing over US legislation on Hong Kong threatened to undermine their trade talks and delay a "phase one" deal that investors had initially hoped to be signed by now.</p>
      <p>"The US House of Representatives on Wednesday passed two bills intended to support protesters in Hong Kong and send a warning to China about human rights. The legislation, which has angered Beijing, has been sent to the White House for President Donald Trump's approval. A person familiar with the matter said Trump was expected to sign it," the newswire said.</p>
      <p>At Bursa today, Petronas Dagangan's share price fell 54 sen or 2.24% to RM23.62 at 3:12pm. The counter is the leading percentage decliner among the 30 KLCI components. Top KLCI decliners include AMMB Holdings Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd.</p>
      <p>In the broader market, the KLCI was down 11.43 points or 0.71% at 1,589.71 at 3.44pm. Earlier today, Petronas Dagangan's share price fell as much as 80 sen or 3.31% to RM23.36.</p>
