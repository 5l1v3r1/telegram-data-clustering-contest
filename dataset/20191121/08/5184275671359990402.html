      <p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie ended their married in 2016. The duo filed for a divorce that year and it has been 3 years since their separation. Post the separation, Brad got linked to several beauties in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>It’s nothing new that we get to see the actor’s link-up news often. However, what makes it interesting is to see whose name is now linked to the Fight Club actor. Well, the latest gorgeous lady who’s been rumoured to be dating Pitt is Alia Shawkat.</p>

      <p>The reports of them being a thing started making rounds on the internet when they attended the opening of the Wilding Cran Gallery’s “LA on Fire” art exhibition recently. A few pics of the duo having a chat at the exhibition surfaced on the social media which sparked the dating rumours.</p>
      <p>So are Brad Pitt really dating Alia Shawkat? Well, the answer is NO. As reported by People, a source informed that the two are ‘absolutely just friends’.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a few months ago, in an interview with GQ, the Once Upon A Time In Hollywood actor opened up about his divorce with Angelina. He told NPR, “A breakup of a family is certainly an eye-opener that as one — and I’m speaking in general again — but as one needs to understand, I had to understand my own culpability in that, and what can I do better. I don’t know that we’ve been taught to deal with those painful events very well”</p>
