        <b>Luka Doncic starred as the Dallas Mavericks beat the injury-hit Golden State Warriors 142-94 - their heaviest defeat since 1973.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Slovenian scored 35 points against a team missing its star players through injury.</p>
      <p>The Warriors, who named the minimum eight players for the game, have the worst record in the NBA this season.</p>
      <p>"Flush it down the toilet. Move on. You don't take anything from a game like this," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.</p>
      <p>His side - NBA finalists in each of the past five seasons - sit bottom of the Western Conference with three wins and 13 losses.</p>
      <p>But their defeat in Dallas was their biggest since a playoff game loss by 56 points to the Lakers 46 years ago.</p>
      <p>Doncic even outscored the whole Warriors side in the first quarter, with 22 points to their 16.</p>
      <p>He went on to record a second straight triple-double with 10 rebounds and 11 assists.</p>
      <p>"He's a very special player on a special run," said Mavs coach Rick Carlisle. "This is not big news. It's getting to be pretty normal."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Kawhi Leonard returned from injury and paired up with fellow summer recruit Paul George for the first time as the <b>Los Angeles Clippers</b> recorded a 107-104 overtime victory over the <b>Boston Celtics.</b> The two combined for 42 points in their first game together.</p>
      <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo's 33 points and 11 rebounds saw the <b>Milwaukee Bucks</b> to their fifth win in a row - and ninth from 10 - as they beat the <b>Atlanta Hawks</b> 135-127.</p>
      <p>And <b>Houston Rockets'</b> eight-game winning streak was ended in a 105-95 defeat by the <b>Denver Nuggets,</b> for whom Nikola Jokic scored a season-high 27 points - despite James Harden also scoring 27 points, seven rebounds and seven assists and Russell Westbrook adding 25 points.</p>
