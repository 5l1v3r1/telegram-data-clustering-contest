      <h1>Kilmarnock support workers lift lid on nightmares of drug and alcohol addiction</h1>
      <h2>Geoff Brown was hooked on heroin while Elizabeth Hewitson endured an abusive relationship at the hands of her ex who was addicted to drink and drugs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tara Fitzpatrick</a></address>
      <p>Geoff Brown never believed he would suffer addiction.</p>
      <p>Growing up in Northern Ireland with no contact to drugs made the prospect of substance misuse unimaginable.</p>
      <p>However, at 22, Geoff was introduced to heroin and discovered that the heartbreaking cycle of addiction can knock on anyone’s door.</p>
      <p>For the next 16 years of his life, Geoff fought a brutal battle of recovery and, despite feeling at times as though he had “no way out”, managed to transform his story into a message which can help save the lives of others.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I never thought I would be a heroin addict,” the now 41-year-old told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock Standard</a>.</p>
      <p>“To me, I thought heroin was a psychological addiction – that you could take it or leave it. When I first heard about it I thought it was like in the movie Trainspotting. At that stage I was really naive.”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Hewitson agrees. “The thing people don’t realise is that addiction could cross your path at any time,” she says.</p>
      <p>For almost 11 years of her life, Elizabeth held the secret that her former partner had a drug and alcohol addiction.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old survived a relationship of violent abuse, psychological trauma and isolation as a result of having no one to turn to.</p>
      <p>Yet, despite seeing first hand the shocking reality of drug addiction and its disastrous effects on others, Elizabeth believes she can show people the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
      <p>Since May, both Elizabeth and Geoff have been the trailblazers of a new pilot project run by the Kilmarnock-based East Ayrshire Advocacy Service.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The project has funding for two years to provide peer-advocacy to those battling addiction, using Elizabeth and Geoff’s unique first-hand experience to provide inspiration for recovery.</p>
      <p>“When I saw this job I just knew it was for me,” Elizabeth told the Kilmarnock Standard.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth’s lived experience helps her to bridge a gap between those with addiction and the family and friends surrounding them.</p>
      <p>“For nearly 11 years I had been keeping a secret about my ex,” she said. “He was battling an alcohol addiction along with a number of drugs, gambling and cheating. I experienced a lot of domestic violence and abuse. I just accepted it for years putting it down to just the way life is.</p>
      <p>“I was manipulated and controlled. I was 15 at school when it started.”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth finally found the strength to leave the relationship and believes her family’s support helped her to get there.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Reflecting on her ex’s denial of his addiction, she said: “It got to the stage where we were driving about in the car and stopping at houses because he had to go and pay the drug dealer. I knew what was happening but he wouldn’t admit it.</p>
      <p>“The most heartbreaking bit for me was when the bank said they were taking my house and car off me because the money which should have been paying for them was going towards someone else’s addiction.</p>
      <p>“I eventually had a light- switch moment. There was so much domestic abuse and violence that something was going to have to give and it was either my frame of mind and mental health or just continuing on this horrible rollercoaster.</p>
      <p>“If it wasn’t for my family taking me in and having to start again, I don’t know what would have happened.</p>
      <p>“My family were oblivious. It wasn’t until my mum witnessed an incident where my house and car were trashed by him that she became aware of how bad it was.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I had a face for my work, a face for my family and then my normal face would come out at night. The thing I felt the most was shame.”</p>
      <p>Shame is something Geoff also believes traps people in addiction. Fear about judgement, isolation and even criminalisation prevent people from speaking out about their battle.</p>
      <p>“I had points where I didn’t want to be here,” he said. “I had a few overdose attempts and that’s because I felt there was no way out. At one point I woke up in a hospital bed with all my family standing around me and I just said, ‘I’m addicted to heroin.’.</p>
      <p>“I was crying out for help but was too ashamed to ask. But when you feel there is nowhere else to go, the only way is up.”</p>
      <p>Geoff hid his addiction at the beginning, putting on a front to the rest of the world.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“For those first seven years it probably looked from the outside like I was doing really well. I had a nice car and a nice house. Then in 2007 it all started falling apart.”</p>
      <p>Both Elizabeth and Geoff believe attitudes to drug misuse and the current model of criminalisation are not working.</p>
      <p>Geoff says: “The problem is, it’s been over 100 years since the war on drugs started and we have stigmatised and stigmatised people going through addictions – usually because of some sort of trauma – and it’s not working.</p>
      <p>“Whenever we talk about decriminalisation, people just assume it’s legalisation and there will be drugs everywhere.</p>
      <p>“But it means people caught in possession will not be criminalised, they will get help. I think it all starts with rebuilding communities. I got recovery because of a community of peers.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Despite the devastation and hardship both Geoff and Elizabeth have experienced, they believe there are positives.</p>
      <p>“I know it has made me the person I am today,” said Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>“The stuff I’ve learned over the years could not be learned in a textbook,” added Geoff.</p>
      <p>“I actually wouldn’t change anything for the world because I’ve turned my experience into education.”</p>
