      <h1>Waterrelief! Mom-to-be fan gets Bengaluru FC box seat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:07:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Manuja-Veerappa-479240089.cms" target="_blank">Manuja Veerappa</a></address>
      <p>BENGALURU: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Meghana-Nair">Meghana Nair</a>, eight months into pregnancy, had one wish before motherhood — to watch her team Bengaluru <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bengaluru-fc">Football</a> Club play at their fortress, the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sree-Kanteerava-stadium">Sree Kanteerava stadium</a>. The 27-year-old BFC fan found the going difficult during the last match since water bottles and eatables from outside are not allowed.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday morning, referring to the team’s Saturday night game against Kerala Blasters, Meghana tweeted, “Hello @bengalurufc! Is there any possibility that I could get permission to carry some hot water from home in a reusable bottle?? I'm currently 33 weeks pregnant &amp; I need to stay hydrated, also take my medication. It was terribly inconvenient when I came to watch previous matches."</p>
      <p>The Sunil Chhetri-led side have won over fans with their thoughtful gestures and this time it wasn’t any different.</p>
      <p>Within a couple of hours, BFC responded,“Hey, Meghana. We love the fact that you're introducing your little one to the Fortress already! We would be more than happy to accommodate you in the Owner's Box for Saturday's game, where there's hot water and more. This one's on us. #FansFirst”</p>

      <p>Meghana later told TOI, “I was touched and pleasantly surprised by the gesture. I’m going for the match with my husband Suraj, who is a huge BFC fan.”</p>
      <p>In the past BFC have stood by female fans on a number of occasions. In January 2017, before a home game, they brought out a video featuring players calling for women’s safety after a case of molestation in the city during New Years’ eve revelry.</p>
      <p>Promoting their hashtag #WeForWomen, they also went pink with their Women’s Day jersey a couple of years back.</p>
      <p>"Our fans have always been at the core of everything we do at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bengaluru-fc">Bengaluru FC</a>. This involves us going that extra yard to hear them out and respond. It takes a lot to support an Indian football club. We understand this and are happy to go above and beyond to give back to the fans.</p>
      <p>"When our media team turned up with Meghana's tweet, it didn't take us any time to agree that the owners' box is where she should watch a sold-out game from,” explained Mandar Tamhane, CEO, Bengaluru FC.</p>
