      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:50:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/education-desk/" target="_blank">Education Desk</a></address>
      <p>The Central government plans to set up a National Police University (NPU), which will offer courses in Police Sciences, Cyber Forensics, Risk Management and Criminology. The varsity, exclusively for the police, will provide intense training, Research and Development (R&amp;D) and policymaking. Its location is yet to be decided.</p>
      <p>“The government has planned to establish a world-class National Police University for education and research in the domains of policing, law enforcement and related areas of internal security and public safety,” the Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs, G Kishan Reddy stated in Parliament.</p>
      <p>“The University will be funded by the Government of India. The functioning of the university is incumbent upon the legislation of the National Police University Bill in the Parliament,” informed Reddy.</p>
      <p>“Police and law and order are state subjects and it is primarily the responsibility of the state governments/UT administrations to bring in the requisite reforms in the police administration to meet the needs of modern policing,” the minister told the House. He added, “The Central Government allocates funds as support incentive to state governments for implementation of police reforms, under the scheme of ‘Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police’.”</p>
