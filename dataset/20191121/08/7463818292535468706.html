      <h1>Galaxy Note 9 gets 120Hz display option but not physically supported</h1>

      <p>The display refresh rate may not matter to most mobile consumers but for gamers, it does. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 offers a 60 Hz refresh rate. As for last year’s Galaxy Note 9, the next software will bring with it a hidden setting—one that switches the refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz. It may probably remind you a bit of the Google Pixel 4’s switching between 60Hz and 90Hz but Samsung made it intentional albeit still hidden from plain users.</p>
      <p>Samsung One UI 2.0 Android 10 beta shows the possibility. However, the Note 9 doesn’t have 120Hz. In theory, it can support such but physically, it doesn’t have that high refresh rate. It is hidden on the Note 9 because it’s really not for the said model.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/one-ui-2-0-beta-android-10-for-samsung-galaxy-note-9-ready-soon-20191112/">One UI Beta 2.0 for Samsung Galaxy Note 9</a> lists the option but hidden. This also means the next-gen Samsung phone will have the same 60Hz refresh rate as one option. The 120Hz may be a permanent refresh rate option, as well as, automatic switching between the two.</p>
      <p>The automatic switching may raise eyebrows though as it did with the Google Pixel 4. For Samsung users, we’re hoping it won’t be an issue as they have other options.</p>

      <p>At the moment though, the Note 9 remains with 60Hz. If you want something higher than that, you may want to consider getting a new phone instead like the Razer Phone 2 and maybe the upcoming Galaxy S11. Samsung did not make any formal announcement about the Galaxy Note 9’s refresh rate. The option was only discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1197178837055852545">someone</a> who looked into the code.</p>
