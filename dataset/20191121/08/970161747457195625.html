      <p>Coldplay have revealed they’re not going to be touring to promote their latest album, explaining that they would want any tour to be carbon neutral.</p>
      <p>Frontman Chris Martin explained that the lads are keen to do their bit for the environment.</p>
      <p>‘We’re taking time to see how our tour can be actively beneficial,’ he said. ‘All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job.</p>
      <p>‘We’re taking time over the next year or two to work out how can, not only our tour be sustainable, but how can it be actively beneficial,’ the star <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-50497715/chris-martin-on-coldplay-s-environmental-touring-pause">added to BBC News.</a></p>
      <p>The band’s last tour saw them put on a whopping 122 shows across four continents in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Chris pointed out: ‘Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally. We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral.’</p>

      <p>Instead, the band will take to Amman, the capital of Jordan, to play two shows which will be streamed on YouTube.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they’re also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/coldplay-performing-natural-history-museum-celebrate-new-album-fans-cant-cope-11179556/">set to stage a show at the Natural History Museum</a>, with the proceeds going towards environmental charity Client Earth.</p>

      <p>Despite turning down a tour, the lads are definitely keeping themselves busy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/robbie-williams-coldplay-clashing-christmas-number-one-gripped-11186754/">as they look to be clashing with Robbie Williams for Christmas number one.</a></p>
      <p>This week will see Robbie release his first ever Christmas album The Christmas Present, while Coldplay are also dropping their anticipated new album Everyday Life on Friday.</p>

      <p>Both releases come one month before Christmas meaning they’ll have to hold onto the top spot for four weeks, but sources say they’re expected to enjoy big sales.</p>
      <p>A s<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10380679/robbie-williams-coldplay-war-christmas-no1/">ource told The Sun</a>: ‘Coldplay and Robbie are both massive forces when it comes to selling albums so the numbers they will shift next week will be huge.</p>
      <p>‘They have strong track records and very dedicated fan bases who will fight for their act to get to number one.’</p>
      <p>They added: ‘At the moment Coldplay are looking likely to pip him to the post, but with a week and a half to go it’s anyone’s game, especially given all of the publicity Robbie has done.’</p>
