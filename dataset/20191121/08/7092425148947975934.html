        <b>Gorgeous morning isn't it, lads?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nothing like a bit of torrential rain to really put a spring in your step when you're on the way to the bus stop to send the morning sandwiched between other humans in a steamy sweatbox that smells like stale socks.</p>
      <p>Well, it's not going to get much better for the rest of the day (or weekend in general) with Met Eireann forecasting plenty of rain - with a risk of flooding in some areas.</p>
      <p>The national forecaster has said the weekend is set to be a washout.</p>
      <p>Today will be mostly cloudy with outbreaks of rain in many areas, heaviest in the south Leinster with a risk of spot flooding.</p>
      <p>Highest temperatures will be 7 to 10 degrees with mostly moderate easterly breezes.</p>
      <p>Tonight will continue mostly cloudy with further outbreaks of rain, which will be heaviest over the east of the country with a continued risk of spot flooding in places. Lowest temperatures overnight will be a bit higher than previous days at of 3 to 6 degrees.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow will continue mostly cloudy with outbreaks of rain in most areas and highest temperatures of 7 to 9 degrees.</p>

      <p>For the weekend, it looks like we can expect more grey and cloudy skies, with plenty more rain.</p>
      <p>Met Eireann said: "Friday night will be mostly cloudy. Early in the night, persistent rain will develop in the east. The rain will become widespread for a time, and will mainly affect the southern half of the country overnight. It will be heaviest in Leinster with a risk of spot flooding.</p>
      <p>"Saturday will be mostly cloudy with outbreaks of showery rain, which will be heaviest over the eastern half of the country. Amounts will be smaller further west with some bright or sunny intervals. Highest temperatures of 7 to 9 degrees with moderate northeast breezes. On Saturday night, rain and drizzle will become light and patchy. Lowest temperatures of 2 to 6 degrees.</p>
      <p>"Sunday will continue mostly cloudy with dry intervals and some patchy rain in the morning. Through the afternoon and evening, persistent rain will spread from the south and will extend to all areas on Sunday night. It will be heavy in many areas. Highest temperatures of 7 to 10 degrees with moderate easterly breezes."</p>
      <p>Right, so it's definitely a weekend to sit at home and binge watch Christmas movies. And no, it's not too early. We are willing to fight you on this.</p>
