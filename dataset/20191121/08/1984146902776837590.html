      <p>An A-Level student seriously injured two pensioners when he crashed his parents' Range Rover into their car.</p>
      <p>Charles Elliott had only passed his test four months earlier when he failed to give way at a junction "at speed" and smashed the high-powered vehicle into an elderly couple's Honda Civic, a court heard.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old, who was 17 at the time and still in school, was then heard shouting "F**k, what have I done?" by witnesses when he stepped out of his car and saw the scale of the accident on the Military Road, near Rudchester, in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a>.</p>
      <p>The pensioners, a man and wife, had to be cut-free from their vehicle and were both taken to hospital, one via the Great North Air Ambulance, with serious injuries.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">court</a> heard that the male suffered numerous pelvic fractures, fractured ribs, a broken collarbone, a broken shoulder and a cut to the liver, while the woman suffered a ruptured diaphragm, multiple fractures to the sternum, multiple fractures to the pelvis and a cut liver.</p>
      <p>Both were in hospital for several weeks.</p>
      <p>Now, Elliott, of Loweswood Close, in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jesmond">Jesmond</a> Dene, Newcastle, has been fined Â£300 and banned from the roads for six months after he admitted one count of careless driving at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court.</p>
      <p>District Judge Bernard Begley told the teen: "I do question the wisdom of anyone making the decision in these particular circumstances to allow you to drive a vehicle that powerful, particularly on rural roads in an area you're not familiar with and you had only driven the vehicle a couple of times before."</p>
      <p>The judge added: "You are so, so lucky that this has not turned into a tragedy and, what I mean is potentially death, because some of the injuries sustained, particularly [the male victim], were quite severe."</p>
      <p>The court was told that Elliott had been at a a school rugby fundraising event at Close House Hotel, in Heddon-on-the-Wall, on April 22 this year when he was asked by his parents to take his friend home in their car</p>
      <p>James Long, prosecuting, said: "The defendant has failed to give way joining the Military Road from a minor road and he's struck an elderly couple's car, which was travelling from west to east on the Military Road.</p>
      <p>"He's effectively driving north and hit them on the left side."</p>
      <p>The court heard the couple were returning from an 80th birthday party when they were hit by Elliott.</p>
      <p>Mr Long added: "One witness saw the Range Rover enter the junction at speed and making no attempt to stop, slow or give way.</p>
      <p>"It collided with another vehicle and he saw the Range Rover lifting high in the air and spinning around and coming to rest on the opposite side of the junction near a field boundary fence."</p>
      <p>The same witness then saw Elliott get out and heard him say "F**k, what have I done? I didn't mean to do it".</p>
      <p>Mr Long said that the pensioners' car had been "catapulted" into the air and landed in a field several metres away.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the male victim said: "The strain and impact on my family has been immense.</p>
      <p>"The anger, frustration and worry has been unbearable. Providing a police statement is about as traumatic as the incident itself."</p>
      <p>Charles Weidner, defending, said it was hard to tell what had caused the accident.</p>
      <p>He added: "It could have been the powered-up vehicle, it could have been a lapse in concentration, but he's full of guilt about causing the accident.</p>
      <p>"It's greatly effected his school work and exams and he's had to have counselling."</p>
      <p>District Judge Begley told Elliott that he now needed to move on with his life as he'd made a mistake and seemed like an "independent and capable young man".</p>
