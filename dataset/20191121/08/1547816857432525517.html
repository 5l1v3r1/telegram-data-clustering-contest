      <p>So far, in Bigg Boss 13, we have been seeing Sidharth Shukla and Devoleena Bhattacharjee locking horns for petty things, however, this time we saw the wild card entrant Vishal Aditya Singh picking up a fight with Devoleena for a change. Well, this started when Vishal became a 'Janani' of the house. We recently stumbled upon a video where Devo is seen blasting on Vishal for spilling out her secret to Sidharth Shukla which obviously, didn’t go down well with the former who ended up crying in the house.</p>
      <p>In the video, Sid wanted to clarify and asked Devo that she thought that Sid told Shefali Jariwala that by suggesting Hindustani Bhau’s name for captaincy, he will save Rashami Desai from nominations. To which, the Saath Nibhana Sathiya actress said that it was just an assumption, Sid didn’t directly say it. So when Sidharth clearly asked Devo who told this; cut to the next scene, Vishal jumps in their conversation and clearly stated that it was Devoleena who told him about Sid’s strategy of saving Desai from nomination.</p>

      <p>However, knowing that this was shared with Vishal, Devo then loses her cool and said that this matter was between him and her. When the questions started raising on Vishal if he was actually trying to create misunderstandings between two people, Singh defended himself by saying, “I’m a man and I don’t create unnecessary misunderstandings." However, completely ignoring what Vishal was trying to say, Bhattacharjee blasts on him for being a two-faced person, leaving her in dismay.</p>

      <p>Now the question is, is Vishal playing the innocent card and playing his own game by adding fuel to the fire or is he actually innocent?</p>
