      <h1>Critic’s Picks: Mike Edel, Mamma Mia!, Garden City Grooves Festival</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:33:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:33</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Devlin</a></address>
      <h3>IN CONCERT</h3>
      <p><b>What: </b>Mike Edel with Wild Romantics<br/><b>Where: </b>Upstairs Cabaret, 15 Bastion Square<br/><b>When: </b>Nov. 22, 7 p.m.<br/><b>Tickets: </b>$16.50 at <a href="http://brownpapertickets.com/">brownpapertickets.com</a></p>
      <p><b>Why: </b>Thresholds, the latest album from singer-songwriter Mike Edel, will be celebrated Friday at Upstairs Cabaret, which provides the perfect sense of intimacy for the music by this former Victoria resident. Now living in Seattle (where he met Chris Walla, formerly of Death Cab For Cutie, who produced Thresholds), he’s back for what should be another memorable turn. Edel was a highlight of the local community when he lived here, so you’ll hear and see nothing but the best from one of the good guys in music.</p>
      <h3>IN CONCERT</h3>
      <p><b>What: </b>Mamma Mia!<br/><b>Where: </b>McPherson Playhouse, 3 Centennial Square<br/><b>When: </b>Nov. 22-Dec. 1<br/><b>Tickets: </b>$21.75-$54.50</p>
      <p><b>Why: </b>The Victoria Operatic Society tackles this hugely popular jukebox musical about a young woman’s search for her birth father. Based on the songs of ABBA, it enjoyed a lengthy run on Broadway, and spawned two films based on the source material. This production will endeavour to match the upbeat vivacity of Mamma Mia! with a cast and chorus of 34, who will sing and dance their way through one of the most dependable productions in Broadway history.</p>
      <h3>IN CONCERT</h3>
      <p><b>What: </b>Garden City Grooves Festival featuring True Loves, MNGWA, Bang Data, the New Groovement and more.<br/><b>Where: </b>Studio Robazzo (2001 Douglas St.), White Eagle Polish Hall (90 Dock St.) and Victoria Event Centre (1415 Broad St.)<br/><b>When: </b>Nov. 21-23<br/><b>Tickets: </b>$14.50-$22.50 from Lyle’s Place, Vinyl Envy and <a href="http://ticketweb.ca/">ticketweb.ca</a></p>
      <p><b>Why: </b>This sixth annual festival of funk and fun welcomes acts from Seattle, San Francisco, Vancouver and Victoria this year for sets scheduled at three venues. Garden City Grooves gets underway tonight with a free show at Studio Robazzo, which makes this already reasonable event all the more attractive. Good times are guaranteed at what remains one of the gems of our festival community.</p>
