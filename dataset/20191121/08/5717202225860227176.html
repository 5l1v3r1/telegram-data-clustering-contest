      <h1>Reported ‘first target’ for Tottenham Hotspur in January clashed with Jose Mourinho last year</h1>
      <h2>The Juventus striker had some strong words for Jose Mourinho last October.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:15:40+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur have appointed Jose Mourinho as the replacement for Mauricio Pochettino and immediately attention is turning to the January transfer window. </p>
      <p>It is hard to see Daniel Levy failing to back the Portuguese in the way he did with Mauricio Pochettino and it is even harder to see Mourinho standing for it.</p>
      <p>Some big names are already being linked with Tottenham for the winter, including Juventus star Paulo Dybala. <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2019/11/20/5dd582e522601deb1f8b45f7.html">Marca are even suggesting</a> he is Mourinho’s first target as Tottenham manager.</p>
      <p>Of course, Tottenham missed out in their pursuit of the Argentine in the summer. Now, with Mourinho at the helm, the hope is Spurs can lure the Juventus talent to London.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, as he has often done, Mourinho has previously rubbed up Dybala the wrong way. </p>
      <p>It came after Mourinho’s Manchester United had pulled off a dramatic late win against Juventus in Turin back in a 2018 Champions League tie. </p>
      <p>After the game, Mourinho cupped his ears to the home support, seemingly taunting the Old Lady fans. </p>
      <p>Several Juventus players took exception to the matter, especially Dybala, who appeared to remonstrate with Mourinho. </p>
      <p>Speaking about the <a href="https://sport.sky.it/calcio/serie-a/2018/11/09/paulo-dybala-juve-intervista-sky.html">event to Sky Sport Italia, </a>Dybala stated that while he did not ‘insult’ Mourinho he did have some advice for the then-United boss. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“I just told him that there was no need to make that gesture.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“There was no need to create more tension than there already was, sometimes you get insulted and it’s bad, but to create more tension than there already is…</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“I told him there was no need, I didn’t insult him. I just told him that and left.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>Will this event have any bearing on Dybala wanting to join Tottenham or not? It is very doubtful. Football is a notoriously fickle game and both parties have probably long since forgotten this even happened. </p>
      <p>More likely to stand in the way is his good form at Juventus, there almost guaranteed Champions League status and financial implications. </p>
      <p>Tottenham fans, however, will hope the Mourinho pulling power can win players of Dybala’s level over.</p>
