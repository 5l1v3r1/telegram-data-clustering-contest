      <p>A film adaptation of Henry James’ <b><i>The Turn Of The Screw</i></b> called <b><i>The Turning</i></b> and directed by <b>Floria Sigismondi</b> (who did music videos for David Bowie, Marilyn Manson, Bjork, Sigur Ros, Interpol, The Cure, Fiona Apple, and more and wrote and directed <i>The Runaways</i>) hits theaters on January 24. As you may expect from a director with a music background like Sigismondi, the film has a pretty amazing list of artists lined up for the soundtrack.</p>
      <p>The film features new or previously unreleased songs by <b>Courtney Love, Kim Gordon, Mitski, Soccer Mommy, Vagabon, Warpaint, Cherry Glazerr, Alice Glass, Alison Mosshart, Kali Uchis, Girl In Red, Empress Of</b>, and more, and it features a score by <b>Lawrence Rothman</b>. Indie-music-friendly actor <b>Finn Wolfhard</b> (<i>Stranger Things</i>) also stars in the film, and his new band <b>The Aubreys</b> are on the soundtrack.</p>
      <p>The first song to be released is Courtney Love’s “Mother,” and here’s what Courtney says about it:</p>
      <blockquote>I read <i>The Turn Of The Screw</i> as a kid, so it’s a genuine privilege to have had the opportunity to work with the genius that is Floria Sigismondi and Lawrence Rothman on this soundtrack -– especially as I’m alongside so many other fantastic female artists I respect. I’ve long admired her work, particularly <i>The Runaways</i> and the Marilyn Manson videos. Floria and Lawrence had a clear vision on what they wanted to achieve and it was an honor to be invited into their studio and to become a part of it.</blockquote>
