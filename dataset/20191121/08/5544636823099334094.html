      <p>Concise News reports that Burna Boy was nominated in the World Music category for his album<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/07/25/burna-boy-features-bob-marleys-son-in-african-giant-album/"> ‘African Giant‘</a> which was released on Friday, July 26, featuring acts like YG, Darmian Marley, Jorja Smith, Manifest, Angelique Kidjo among others.</p>
      <p>The announcement was made by the Recording Academy, popularly known as the Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p>The World Music category has African music legend like Angelique Kidjo who is also a Grammy winner as a nominee.</p>
      <p>Since the news broke on the internet, celebrities have taken turns to congratulate Burna Boy and Stefflon has also joined the league.</p>
      <p>In a Twitter post Stefflon wrote “Issa Grammy for the boy!!!!!!!!! 🦍🙏🏽🏆😁 We claim it!!!!! ❤️ #AfricanGiant”</p>

      <p>According to a report, Burna Boy and Shyngle were seen at an outlet in Lagos.</p>
      <p>But later debunking the claims, the duo was spotted sharing a passionate kiss at a popular club in Lagos.</p>
