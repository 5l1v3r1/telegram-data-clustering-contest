      <h1>TV Ratings: 'Masked Singer' Bounces Back, 'Chicago' Trio Rises</h1>

      <p><i>The Masked Singer</i> rebounded from last week's series-low ratings to reclaim the top spot among adults 18-49. NBC's <i>Chicago</i> dramas also improved, closing out their fall runs with Wednesday's three largest total audiences.</p>
      <p>After hitting a low <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cma-awards-masked-singer-tv-ratings-wednesday-nov-13-2019-1254764">opposite the CMA Awards</a> a week ago, <i>The Masked Singer</i> rose three tenths of a point in adults 18-49 to a 1.9 rating for Fox, best of the night on broadcast. It also improved by more than a million viewers to 6.67 million (and will add substantially to that with delayed and digital viewing). <i>Almost Family</i> stayed at its season low of 0.5 in the demo, though it was up a bit in viewers at 1.88 million.</p>
      <p>At NBC, <i>Chicago Fire</i> scored a same-day season high with 8.31 million viewers, topping the 8.22 million for the Oct. 16 crossover episode. It also ticked up in adults 18-49 to a 1.2. <i>Chicago Med</i> (8.39 million, 1.2) and <i>PD</i> (6.96 million, 1.1) each drew their second-largest viewer counts of the season, behind the crossover, and were up a tenth apiece in the 18-49 demo.</p>
      <p>CBS' <i>Survivor</i> also ticked up from a week ago, scoring a 1.2 in adults 18-49 and 6.65 million viewers (vs. 1.1 and 6.07 million last week). <i>SEAL Team</i> (0.7, 4.66 million) and <i>SWAT</i> (0.5, 3.74 million) were on par with their same-day season averages.</p>
      <p>ABC's lineup returned from a week off with steady 18-49 ratings: <i>The Goldbergs</i> and <i>Modern Family</i> are both at 0.9, <i>Schooled</i> is at 0.7, <i>Single Parents</i> at 0.6 and <i>Stumptown</i> at 0.5. (<i>Modern Family</i> and <i>Stumptown</i> rank in the top 20 for delayed viewing gains.) The CW's <i>Riverdale</i> and <i>Nancy Drew</i> each earned a 0.2.</p>
      <p>Fox and NBC tied for the 18-49 lead in primetime, each averaging a 1.2. CBS finished third at 0.8, a little ahead of ABC's 0.7. Telemundo (0.5) edged out Univision (0.4), and The CW trailed with a 0.2.</p>
