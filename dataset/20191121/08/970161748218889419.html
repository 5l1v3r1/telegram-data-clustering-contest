      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ovie-soko/">Ovie Soko</a> is officially returning to basketball, following his stint in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> villa.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old – who ended the ITV2 series in third place with ex India Reynolds – has joined the London Lions, and will be making his court comeback next month.</p>
      <p>And we are absolutely living for it.</p>
      <p>Confirming the news, he revealed his excitement at playing basketball in his hometown.</p>
      <p>‘I’m excited to be back home and help contribute to basketball back home where my love for the sport started,’ <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7706063/Ovie-Soko-EXCLUSIVE-Love-Island-finalist-signs-permanent-basketball-deal-London-Lions.html">the MailOnline reports he said</a>.</p>
      <p>‘To be able to play in front of friends and family and supporters in my hometown is huge for me and look forward to pushing the basketball culture in the right direction.’</p>
      <p>While his new head coach, Vince Macaulay, added: ‘Soko is a highly experienced and talented player who is in demand across Europe.</p>

      <p>Basically, he’s smashed it.</p>
      <p>Ovie’s news comes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/26/love-islands-ovie-soko-india-reynolds-split-months-leaving-villa-amid-cheat-claims-10988279/">after he split from India Reynolds</a>, just months after they left the Love Island villa together.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the pair found it hard to co-ordinate their conflicting schedules, and ended things amicably.</p>
      <p>But, rather than throw himself a pity party with seven gallons of Ben And Jerry’s, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/love-islands-ovie-soko-remaining-positive-little-help-rihanna-india-reynolds-split-10996204/">the athlete remained as upbeat as ever</a>, quoting Rihanna and reminding fans to ‘shine like diamonds’.</p>
      <p>Sharing a video on his Instagram page soon after their break-up, he said: ‘On this beautiful Sunday you should all remember: “Shine bright like a diamond.” Because Rihanna said so’.</p>
      <p>We are absolutely not worthy of Ovie Soko.</p>
