      <h1>How Northumberland proved a stunning subject for photography competition</h1>
      <h2>Northern Lights, dramatic waves and a less than sheepish sheepdog among entries showing diversity of Northumberland in all its glory</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tony Henderson</a></address>
      <p>Bill the collie certainly wasn’t sheepish when the camera pointed in his direction – and he ended up providing one of the top pictures for a photography competition.</p>
      <p>The image of Bill rounding up the sheep in the College Valley in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> against a Cheviots background won a runner-up award for photographer Colin Balmbro, from Wooler.</p>
      <p>It was one of 200 entries in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland-county-council">Northumberland County Council’s</a> Discover our Land “Days Out” photo competition, which celebrated places to visit in the county.</p>

      <p>The winner of the competition, which attracted more than 5,500 public votes on the Discover our Land Facebook page, was Sunderland <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nissan">Nissan</a> worker Ashley Corr, of Houghton-le-Spring, for his stunning picture of the Northern Lights at Holy Island.</p>
      <p>The other runner-up was David Southern of Warkworth for his dramatic Waves at Howick, with Dunstanburgh Castle as the brooding backdrop.</p>
      <p>Charlotte Christian, aged 12, who lives in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/prudhoe">Prudhoe</a>, was the winner of the under-16s section for her autumnal shot of the River Tyne from Ovingham Bridge. The pupil at Ovingham Middle School won a prize of a three-hour photography class with professional photographer Neil Denham, also one of the judges.</p>
      <p>“I have been taking photos, just on my phone, for a little while now and I really enjoy it,” Charlotte said. “I was on my way home from school when I took this one and just loved all the different colours and the way the water was moving in currents.</p>
      <p>“My mum entered me in the competition and I was so happy when she told me I had won. It’s really exciting to now get the chance to go out with a professional photographer.</p>

      <p>“I would love to do it as a career when I’m older and I’m hoping to get a camera for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> so when I go out with Neil I can take some really good photos.”</p>
      <p>Charlotte’s mum Louise said: “She is absolutely over the moon to win and so is excited to get the opportunity to learn some tricks of the trade from a professional photographer.”</p>
      <p>Ashley meanwhile only entered his picture minutes before the competition closed after hearing about it from a friend.</p>

      <p>The amateur photographer, who won an overnight stay for two at Langley Castle in Northumberland, said: “I have been taking photos in our region for quite a few years now just as a hobby, but this is the first time I have entered a competition so I am delighted to have won.</p>
      <p>“The photo is a nod to the fact that the beauty and splendour of Northumberland isn’t just apparent during daylight. Quite often the magic begins when darkness falls – and on this occasion Mother Nature played her part and put on a stunning light show from the refuge hut at Holy Island.</p>
      <p>“It’s a memory that will stay with me for a long time, and another reason why my hobby is so enjoyable.”</p>
      <p>Neil said: “Once again the standard of entries was outstanding and we were particularly excited by the standard of the youngsters who entered. It’s fantastic to see young talent coming through and I am very much looking forward to passing on my knowledge to Charlotte.</p>
      <p>“Northumberland has so many stunning locations. It’s a real playground for photographers, and all those shortlisted show the breadth of things on offer and the great days out you can have in the county.</p>
      <p>“The Discover our Land campaign is really bringing the county to the fore and sharing the county’s best stories.”</p>
      <p>The campaign was launched in January to raise the profile of Northumberland as a place to live, work, visit and invest. For more information go to <a href="http://www.discoverourland.co.uk/">www.discoverourland.co.uk</a></p>
