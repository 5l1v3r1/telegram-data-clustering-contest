      <p>AN intro of swirling colours somewhere between a bath bomb in water and the endpapers of a hardback novel sets the tone for this visually vibrant film that examines the life of an aging film director.</p>
      <p>Salvador Mallo (Antonio Banderas) suffers from a plethora of ailments that prevent him from continuing to make films, though one of his earlier films Sabor has been remastered and re-released to much acclaim.</p>
      <p>He is reunited with the star of that film Alberto (Asier Etxeandia) after years of falling out, who introduces him to heroin.</p>
      <p>Salvador’s drug-induced dreams flash back to his life living in caves in rural Spain with his mother Jacinta (Penelope Cruz) and her determination to get him a good education despite their lack of money.</p>

      <p>Pain and Glory plays around with the idea of stories within stories, of art as a form of communication between the past and the present, of pain as both an inhibitor and an instigator of creativity.</p>
      <p>Yet the film never feels like it can settle, always flitting between the sunshine of Salvador’s youth and the moroseness of his current state.</p>
      <p>Despite his misery guts of a character, Banderas is charming in this role, clothed in stunning bright colours and framed beautifully whether in his stylish apartment or in front of an unusually picturesque wall in a doctor’s waiting room.</p>
      <p>Slow and pondering in one moment, passionate and emotional the next, Pain and Glory is a mixed bag of a film that does not quite reach its potential.</p>
