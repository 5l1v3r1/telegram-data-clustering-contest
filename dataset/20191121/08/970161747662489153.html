      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/norman-reedus/page/2/?iframe=true&amp;theme_preview=true%2Ffeed%2F">Norman Reedus</a> revealed that filming has wrapped on the tenth season of zombie drama <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-walking-dead/">The Walking Dead</a>.</p>
      <p>Daryl Dixon himself took to social media to celebrate the momentous occasion. Stakes have been high for the latest run of the show, as some of its biggest and most recogniseable stars – including defacto lead Andrew Lincoln, Lauren Cohen and Marvel star Danai Gurira – have all left for pastures new.</p>
      <p>Well, almost all. It has been confirmed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/the-walking-dead-season-10-episode-5-questions-we-have-as-maggies-return-teased-11031593/">Cohen’s Maggie is finally set to return</a> at some point in the future.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the 50 year-old actor shared a blood-splattered snap with co-star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/melissa-mcbride/">Melissa McBride</a> (who plays Carol) and revealed ‘season 10, that’s a wrap.’</p>
      <p>The picture, however, will do little to stifle rumours started by the two actors themselves that besties <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/the-walking-dead-season-10-will-carol-and-daryl-leave-together-were-scared-10880467/">Daryl and Carol could end up leaving the show together</a>.</p>

      <p>‘You ever wonder if this is all there is?’ Carol asked Daryl after her return this season. ‘Just run into people, kill each other until whoever’s left says enough?’</p>
      <p>‘No more fighting,’ Daryl replied. ‘Just get on the bike and go. See who’s left.’</p>

      <p>Fans still have a way to go, though, before they get to witness the end of this season altogether. Things do seem to be coming to a head, however.</p>
      <p>Samantha Morton was the biggest new arrival for the new instalment as Alpha, the creepy leader of the Whisperers, a band of apocalypse survivors who camouflage themselves under the skin of dead walkers.</p>
      <p>Many fans have a feeling, however, that the Big Bad<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/walking-dead-season-10-alpha-going-meet-savage-end-hands-negan-11002043/"> may meet her end at the hands of an even bigger bad – Negan himself</a>.</p>

      <p>There was a game-changing twist at the end of the most recent episode as a huge hero was killed off – and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/walking-dead-season-10-siddiq-dead-avi-nash-reaction-11173925/">the star behind the twist has finally broken their silence</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, we know The Walking Dead loves throwing twists and turns at the audience, so<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/walking-dead-season-10-siddiq-dead-avi-nash-reaction-11173925/"> we have several questions as to what this twist means</a> as we approach the endgame of season 10.</p>
