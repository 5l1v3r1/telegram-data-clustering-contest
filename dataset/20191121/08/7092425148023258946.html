        <b>A court in Spain has ruled that Ryanair can no longer charge an extra fee for hand luggage.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Finding the policy "abusive", the court ruled the airline must stop charging customers an additional fee for taking more than one item into the cabin.</p>
      <p>The policy, which was introduced last year, sees customers charged if they bring anything more than a small bag onboard.</p>
      <p>The ruling follows a complaint by a passenger travelling from Madrid to Brussels, who went to court after staff forced her to pay €20 to bring her 10kg luggage on board.</p>
      <p>The court ordered Ryanair to refund her the €20 plus interest, but rejected her demand for compensation of a further €10 for the suffering she experienced, according to court documents.</p>
      <p>The judge ruled that the hand luggage, by size and weight, could be easily carried in the cabin, pointing to a Spanish regulation that allows passengers to take hand luggage on board at no additional cost.</p>
      <p>The judge characterised the charge as abusive, adding that it "curtailed the rights that the passenger has recognised by law", and declared it invalid in Spain.</p>
      <p>"This ruling will not affect Ryanair's baggage policy, either in the past or in the future, as it is an isolated case that misinterpreted our commercial freedom to determine the size of our cabin baggage," the airline said in a statement.</p>
      <p>According to Reuters, when asked if it was planning to ignore the Spanish ruling or appeal it in the European Court of Justice, Ryanair declined to comment.</p>
