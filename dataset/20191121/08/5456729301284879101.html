      <p>For his series on the certificate forgery scandal of erstwhile finance minister, Kemi Adeosun, a PREMIUM TIMES journalist, AbdulAziz Abdulaziz, has made the shortlist for Fetisov Journalism Awards.</p>
      <p>Mr Abdulaziz’s series, “Bursting a Powerful Nigerian Minister: The Kemi Adeosun series”, fingered Ms Adeosun for skipping the compulsory one–year service programme and her use of a fake certificate to get jobs in all of private, state and federal levels as against the law.</p>
      <p>As a result of the story, the minister ultimately resigned from office.</p>
      <p>The same story won Mr Abdulaziz the 2018 Investigative Journalist of the year in the 13th Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism Awards.</p>
      <p>This series was shortlisted in the Outstanding Investigative Reporting category alongside 11 others.</p>
      <p>

      <p>They include Damilola Banjo of Sahara Reporter for her “Investigation: How forgery, bribery, exam malpractice booms at Lagos primary schools”; International Centre for Investigative Reporting, ICIR’s, Amos Abba for his “How Nestle Nigeria contaminates water supply of its host community in Abuja” entry.</p>
      <p>Others are Isaac Anyaogu for his “Dying in instalments” investigation published by BusinessDay; Punch’s Afeez Hanafi story on “Blind votes: Frustration of visually-impaired voters who depend on others to make their choice”; “Despite our cries, INEC refused to make provision for us – Visually-impaired voters”; and Peter Nkanga’s <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/274467-special-report-how-buharis-govt-detained-nigerian-journalist-for-two-years-without-trial.html">special report</a></b> on “How Buhari’s govt detained Nigerian journalist for two years without trial”.</p>
