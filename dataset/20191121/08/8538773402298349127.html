      <h1>Lottery winner completes Partick Thistle takeover</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:46:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p>EuroMillions lottery winner Colin Weir has completed his takeover of Scottish Championship side Partick Thistle and said he intends to hand over ownership to supporters in 2020.</p>
      <p>Weir -- a lifelong Thistle fan -- has bought a majority shareholding and a holding in land at Firhill Stadium, where his team play, but will give the land back to the club.</p>
      <p>The 71-year-old will also give his 55% shareholding to a fan group that is in development, with the free transfer of shares taking place "no later than March 30 2020," according to Weir.</p>
      <p>Weir, who won the lottery in 2011, has already invested approximately £2.5 million of his £161m prize money in the Glasgow club.</p>
      <p>He previously pledged £6m towards a new training ground before withdrawing his support in August due to "uncertainties" about a potential takeover by a foreign consortium.</p>
      <p>An interim board "comprising of a mix of experienced business people and fan representatives" will be formed and a working group is to be established jointly by the PTFC Trust and Thistle for Ever organisations. The move will create a body to receive the shareholding.</p>
      <p>"Thistle for Ever planted the thought of fan ownership as a real option in my mind," Weir said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"But this has all happened quicker than anyone might have anticipated. That's why I have offered a three-to-four-month window for fans to get everything in place before handing over shares.</p>
      <p>"They want to get it right and I want to be sure that when the new entity is operational, there is a structure that will allow for a smooth transfer of ownership. This is a major financial commitment on my part as fan owners will not need to repay a penny -- but I believe this gives fan ownership the best possible start."</p>
      <p>Weir also said there would be a future announcement on plans for funding the Thistle's youth academy.</p>
