      <h1>Morrisons shoppers slam supermarket after loyalty points vanish for Christmas</h1>
      <h2>A number of disgruntled shoppers have said that they've saved up all year for their Christmas shop only to find, at the till, that their points have mysteriously been wiped</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:40:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>Millions of people across the UK rely on loyalty cards to build up savings all year round - often to help with seasonal expenses such as Christmas, birthdays and expensive purchases.</p>
      <p>However, the past few months has seen a surge in cards being targeted by fraudsters - leading to accounts being suddenly raided.</p>
      <p>This is the argument Morrisons put forward after being accused of wiping More accounts in the run up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>Shoppers have vented their anger online, claiming their loyalty points have vanished from their cards after saving up for months for their festive food shop.</p>
      <p>Some said they discovered their points had been spent in other parts of the country, suggesting accounts were hacked, the investigation by <a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-7706955/Morrisons-customers-card-loyalty-points-vanish.html">This Is Money found</a> .</p>
      <p>On twitter, one wrote: "When are @Morrisons going to investigate all these points going missing? Clearly the more card accounts aren't very secure are they?"</p>

      <p>Another said: "'I should boycott the place".</p>
      <p>Others are unsure about where their points have disappeared to, slamming the grocer's customer services team for their lack of support.</p>
      <p>One customer, Jim Ainsworth, told the Mail that he tried to redeem 5,000 Morrisons points for a £5 voucher but was told he hadn't reached the required number of points.</p>
      <p>After explaining that he had in fact got the exact number of points needed, the staff member told him that there had been "hundreds" of complaints about the same issue within the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>He was told to phone the number on the back of the card or one of the members of staff would do it for him.</p>
      <p>"I have called the number myself twice and also got a lady at the store to do it twice," the customer explained.</p>

      <p>"Each time, we got through to someone who takes the card details and then says: "I have reloaded your points, so next time you shop, when you hand over your card you should get your voucher"."</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the points were never reloaded, despite the promise from Morrisons staff.</p>
      <p>"I actually fell for this three times, and spent about £30, when I should have been boycotting the place," he said.</p>
      <p>A Morrisons spokesman said: "Online hackers target people who use the same username and password across multiple sites.</p>
      <p>"We regularly remind our customers about the importance of using a unique password.</p>
      <p>"We take online security very seriously and our customer data has not been breached."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The supermarket said anyone who has had points stolen should contact Morrisons by calling the number on the back of their More loyalty card.</p>
      <p>It comes just weeks after a Nectar investigation found dozens of customers were having their cards blocked without warning.</p>
      <p>One loyal customer said her Nectar card was cancelled after she saved up for months to buy gifts for a charity raffle.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old was then told Nectar had experienced a fraud scare - leading many accounts to be blocked for precautionary measures.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's is currently <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/sainsburys-making-huge-changes-nectar-20130842">in the process of unveiling a whole new Nectar system</a> that will allow users to collect points - and gain rewards - digitally.</p>
      <p>It's expected to follow the launch of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tesco-launches-new-clubcard-plus-20386972">new paid-for Tesco Clubcard - that gives shoppers 10% off their shop for a £7.99 monthly fee</a> .</p>
      <p>Morrisons, meanwhile, allows you to pick up points every time you shop in store or online.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can earn five More Points for every £1 they spend and five More Points per litre when they buy fuel at Morrisons.</p>
      <p>It gives customers a £5 More voucher for every 5,000 points they earn - with £1,000 equivalent to £5 off.</p>
