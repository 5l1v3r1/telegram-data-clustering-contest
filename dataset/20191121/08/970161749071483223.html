      <p>The lawyer for several of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged victims has insisted that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> ‘must cooperate’ with the FBI’s investigation into the sex offender.</p>
      <p>Lisa Bloom, representing the alleged victims, said the Duke of York was ‘not credible’ in his BBC Newsnight tell-all interview on Saturday, as she called for him to to take further action to assist the probe.</p>
      <p>Her demand came after Andrew announced on Wednesday night that he<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/queen-gives-prince-andrew-permission-step-back-public-duties-epstein-links-11190989/"> would step down from public duties</a> for the ‘foreseeable future’ amid the scandal.</p>
      <p>In an unprecedented move for a royal in modern times, the Duke wrote to his mother, the Queen, requesting the move as it was ‘clear’ his relationship with the disgraced financier was causing ‘disruption to my family’s work’.</p>
      <p>Pressure had been mounting on the Duke in the wake of his ‘nuclear level bad’<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-was-at-pizza-express-day-accuser-claims-she-was-forced-into-sex-with-him-11168884/"> interview</a> and last night he said he was ‘willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required’.</p>

      <p>But Ms Bloom said his comments didn’t go far enough and tweeted: ‘Prince Andrew was simply not credible in his interview.</p>

      <p>‘He and his staff must cooperate with all investigations, show up for civil depositions and trials, and produce all documents. We are just getting started.’</p>
      <p>Ms Bloom’s mother and fellow lawyer Gloria Allred, who also represents victims of the US financier, said Andrew’s position on assisting the authorities was not clear.</p>
      <p>She told the BBC: ‘Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so?</p>
      <p>‘My clients who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken to law enforcement without being ‘required’ to do so.’</p>
      <p>The lawyer flagged two possible courses of action, adding: ‘One is the criminal justice investigation to see if charges should be filed in reference to anyone who might have knowingly conspired with Mr Esptein to recruit and to sex traffic underage girls to him.’</p>
      <p>She said the other option was the pursuit of civil lawsuits, like that which she filed on behalf of a woman known as Jane Doe 15, who was allegedly assaulted by Epstein when she was aged 15.</p>

      <p>Ms Bloom also raised the possibility of questioning the Duke over his relationship with Epstein and said she has ‘the right to subpoena [submit a writ summoning someone to give evidence] witnesses to come and take depositions’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She told BBC Breakfast: ‘It’s not going to be easy to subpoena someone like Prince Andrew, he’s obviously not walking down the street where a process server can just hand him a piece of paper, it’s a lot more complicated.</p>
      <p>‘If he refused to come we may have a diplomatic situation between (the UK) and (the US). I hope it doesn’t come to that.</p>
      <p>‘I take him at his word that he says he is going to co-operate and I hope that’s what’s going to happen.’</p>
      <p>Following the interview, Andrew was criticised for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein’s victims – many of whom were minors – and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the sex offender, who took his own life in prison earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Major firms including telecoms giant BT and bank Barclays were among a number of multimillion-pound businesses, universities and charities which have since distanced themselves from Andrew.</p>

      <p>It is understood there have been ongoing discussions within the royal family about the situation, with Andrew meeting with the Queen at Buckingham Palace and seeking advice from his brother, the Prince of Wales.</p>
      <p>In the interview, the Duke denied claims he slept with Virginia Giuffre – then Roberts – one of Epstein’s victims, on three separate occasions and twice while she was underage.</p>

      <p>He said the alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen as he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/pizza-express-woking-flooded-fake-reviews-prince-andrew-interview-11169085/">taking her to Pizza Express in Woking</a> for a party.</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre said the same alleged sexual liaison began with the duke sweating heavily as they danced at London nightclub Tramp.</p>
      <p>But the Duke said he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat and had no recollection of meeting Mrs Giuffre.</p>
      <p>He has since faced a barrage of firms and organisations terminating or reviewing their association with his Pitch@Palace tech entrepreneurs initiative, including Barclays and BT and KPMG.</p>
      <p>London Metropolitan University was considering the duke’s role as its patron, while a student panel at Huddersfield University passed a motion to lobby Andrew to resign as its chancellor.</p>
