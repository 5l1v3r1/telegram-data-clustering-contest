            <b>BRD Vs RJS Dream11, Probable Playing 11, Toss, Pitch And Match Report: Jaffer of a match awaits us today as two crackling sides take on each other. </b>
          </p>
          <p>Unbeaten after been put down in their tournamnet opener, Baroda are entering the dramatic land of the Super League round of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy as one of the most inform sides in the marquee tournamnet. This is a side which comes packed with immense momentum, a side whose recent run of results see it earn the stature of overwhelming favourites to make it to the ensuing stage.</p>
          <p>The exquisite and exuberant run the side are in at the moment saw them occupy a place in the pinnacles of Group A with the side edging past Karnataka to nail themselves down into first place by virtue of a more superior net run-rate. Defeating Services by a gargantuan 35 runs in their most recent outing in the exhibition domestic tournamnet, the side have been hailed for their enterprising and enigmatic brand of cricket, one which has seen them lay down a marker.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere, after making it this far with earning second place in Group A, Rajasthan themselves are unbeaten in their last three outings with the side making light work and walking all over their opponents in their foregone tie. In what was an extremely pleasing to the eye performance, one to write home about as the side covered themselves in glory in both the dockets of the fixture, Rajasthan end up cruising to a 9 wicket win as they needed a mere 5 overs to peel down the 70 run target.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>The dual nature of the wicket at our disposal for this encounter means only one thing. The team emerging with a favourable outcome from the toss is set to come out and choose to bat first with the batters getting a nice, hard track under the sun before the pitch starts to crumble up and open to see the spinners come into full effect in the second part of the contest.</p>

                            <h3>BRD vs RJS Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With 228 runs in his kitty at this stage of the tournamnet, Baroda’s Kedar Devdhar comes into our side for today’s match having earned his spot. The wicket-keeper has engrossed us in exhilarating and titillating dsplays, one which have shown his succulent traits as a bat to be chosen our as choice with the gloves today.</p>
                            <h3>BRD vs RJS Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>A reason for him entering the wake of this clash having tasted such consummate success is the calibre of Aditya Waghmode, Baroda’s leading run getter at the moment. With 236 runs in 6 matches, he and Devdhar have matched each other shot for shot, complimenting each other exquisitely with the bat’s calibre coming at the forefront in this instalment of the tournamnet.</p>
                            <p>From Rajasthan meanwhile we are venturing in with Ankit Lamba and Arjit Gupta, two players who’ll be asked to hold fort in both the top-order and lower middle-order, two names we envisage doing a bulk of the scoring for their side today.</p>
                            <h3>BRD vs RJS Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>With 130 runs in 6 matches, we have Mahipal Lomror from Rajasthan come into our side at the first name to be encrusted for this facet alongside Chadrapal Singh with the spinner’s vibrant of bowling set to make for a treacherous task to get under. Elsewhere from Baroda we have gone in with the two players as well, choosing their two most quintessential names who have been responsible for the side showing their unprecedented ascendancy.</p>
                            <p>In Deepak Hooda, the side have a name who has ended up with 177 runs along with the 1 wicket while Swapnil Singh has returned with the 161 runs and 8 wickets, two players who have encapsulated ther skill set in tandem for the side. </p>
                            <h3>BRD vs RJS Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>His 10 wickets have taken a mere 4 matches coming, seeing Deepak Chahar continue his imperious and flawless touch with the ball across the course of November. Khaleel Ahmed has returned with the 7 wickets as well, making this new ball and death overs partnership an extremely daunting one, one which is set to shroud the opposition in a tiff today.</p>
                            <p>Elsewhere, the 15 wickets in 6 matches make Lukman Meriwala his side’s leading wicket taker to make the stoutheaded spearhead our last selection for this forthcoming encounter.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to make Swapnil the unit’s captain for this tie whilst Deepak will represent us as the vice-captain.</p>
