      <h1>Tories extend lead over Labour ahead of its ambitious manifesto launch</h1>

      <p>The prime minister extended his lead over Labour to 11 points in an opinion poll conducted by Savanta ComRes for the Telegraph newspaper last night.</p>
      <p>With just over three weeks to go until the 12 December election, support for the Conservatives stood at 42%, with Labour trailing behind at 31%.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn hopes his ambitious manifesto – which <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/labour-target-rich-manifesto-includes-plan-150000-new-council-homes-11192617/">he will launch later today in Birmingham</a> – can turn around the party’s fortunes in the polls.</p>
      <p>The latest polling figures show the Tories up by one point from the last poll published on Saturday, while Labour was down two points.</p>
      <p>Savanta ComRes says it is the largest Tory lead the polling company has seen since before the 2017 snap election.</p>
      <p>The research, asking 2,035 British adults their voting intentions, was completed between 18 and 19 November, before Tuesday’s head-to-head leaders debate.</p>

      <p>Support for the Liberal Democrats rose to 15%, up one point in the Savanta ComRes poll, while the Brexit Party was unchanged at 5%.</p>

      <p>Previous calculations <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/tories-surge-ahead-election-polls-ahead-tv-debate-11179542/">reported on at Metro.co.uk</a> used data from the Britain Elects poll tracker, which weights data from various British polling companies to arrive at an industry average.</p>
      <p>The latest Britain Elects figures, that include the Savanata ComRes poll results, also puts the Tories at 11-points ahead of Labour, with the smaller parties trailing behind.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson and his party are expected to continue to drip-feed policy announcements in the run-up to the party’s manifesto launch next week.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, just a day before Labour’s manifesto launch, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/boris-johnson-lets-slip-manifesto-pledge-cut-national-insurance-11191246/">Mr Johnson made a tax cut promise</a> while on the campaign trail, vowing to lift two million low-paid workers out of making National Insurance contributions altogether by raising the threshold from £8,628 per year to £9,500.</p>
      <p>Labour criticised the headline-grabbing move, estimating it would save low earners only £1.64 per week.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn will today set out his stall with promises to take on billionaires in order to boost wages, support the NHS and tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader will say his ‘manifesto of hope’ that is ‘fully costed’ involves no tax increases for 95% of taxpayers.</p>

      <p>Instead, he will vow to go after ‘tax dodgers, bad bosses and big polluters’ in an attack on ‘the establishment’ and ‘bankers and billionaires’.</p>

      <p>The party’s manifesto includes the biggest social housing plan since the 1960s, to build 150,000 new council homes with £75 billion of money from borrowing.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, housing secretary Robert Jenrick is expected to reveal Tory plans to build one million extra homes over the next five years as well as measures to make it easier for renters to buy.</p>
      <p>And home secretary Priti Patel is also set to announce plans for the Tories to consult on doubling the jail sentence for those found guilty of attacking police and other emergency service workers, extending their time behind bars from one year to two.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems – who have repeatedly experienced a squeeze in the polls – yesterday acknowledged for the first time that it would be a ‘big step’ for the party to get a majority government.</p>
      <p>The party<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/lib-dems-launch-stop-brexit-manifesto-setting-party-remain-11189629/"> put stopping Brexit at the heart of its manifesto</a> but Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said the pro-EU party was not a ‘one-trick pony’.</p>
      <p>Other incentives in the manifesto include plans to provide childcare for all pre-school children over the age of nine months.</p>

      <p>Sir Ed Davey, the party’s Treasury spokesman, went so far as to open the door to supporting a minority Tory administration.</p>
      <p>He told the BBC’s Andrew Neil programme that the Lib Dems could strike a deal if Mr Johnson signed-up to holding a new referendum on Europe.</p>

      <p>The Green Party, whose manifesto was released on Tuesday, has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/greens-launch-manifesto-100000000000-fight-climate-change-11180349/">set out plans to invest £100 billion a year</a> in tackling climate change with a ‘Green New Deal’, intended to get Britain to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2030.</p>
