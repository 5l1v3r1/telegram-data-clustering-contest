      <h1>Google's Biggest Donkey Products in History</h1>
      <h2>Even unicorn companies like Google have some setbacks. Here's a list of Google's biggest donkey products in history.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Larry Kim</a></address>
      <p>Google is one of the biggest companies in the world.</p>
      <p>And that's no fluke; this unicorn company has put out product after product that has taken the world by storm.</p>
      <p>But not every launch is a rocket.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/12-powerful-google-hacks-to-make-you-a-power-searcher.html?source=post_page---------------------------">Google</a> has released a few flops -- even when we all really think that the products will soar.</p>
      <p>Here's a list of Google products that have failed, to remind us as entrepreneurs that not everything goes exactly as planned.</p>
      <h4>Google+</h4>
      <p>Google+ was Google's answer to -- well -- everything.</p>
      <p>And that might just be why it failed.</p>
      <p>It featured video conferencing, address books, commenting plugins, authentication; you name it, Google+ probably had it. </p>
      <p>Google+ was an attempt at a <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/11-social-media-marketing-tools-to-bookmark-now.html">social media</a> platform, but with all of the other platforms that were already running the social sphere, there didn't seem to be a lot of space made for it. </p>
      <p>Essentially no one was using it -- but that's not the only reason why this donkey product failed. </p>
      <p>There was a massive security flaw that gave developers access to over 500,000 different profiles, whether they were marked as public or private. </p>
      <p>This forced Google to put an end to Google+ forever.</p>
      <h4>Reader</h4>
      <p>Unlike Google+, Google Reader was actually popular among users. </p>
      <p>The reality, however, is that the product had several very dedicated users, but the usage numbers simply weren't enough. </p>
      <p>In addition to the fact that usage numbers didn't add up, there was the problem of modern news consumption.</p>
      <p>People don't sit down to read the news these days.</p>
      <p>We see the effects of this everywhere; in print news floundering, and in digital news sites running into trouble, as well. </p>
      <p>Nowadays, people are constantly consuming news content from social media. </p>
      <p>It's hard to keep up.</p>
      <p>So, much like many other news websites and publications, Reader became another Google product that failed.</p>
      <h4>Google Desktop</h4>
      <p>Google Desktop was developed to bring the power of Google search capabilities to a person's desktop.</p>
      <p>That would mean that the person did not have to open a browser and navigate to Google to perform a Google search.</p>
      <p>Google Desktop was discontinued because the functionality was simply no longer needed in a world of more and more cloud-based storage, computing, and data. </p>
      <p>The product also faced a number of criticisms related to security and privacy due to some vulnerabilities that would allow hackers to access private data from remote systems or complete control over the system.</p>
      <p>So, because it was not anything new anymore, and because of privacy scandals, Google Desktop, though an interesting idea, became another Google product that failed. </p>
      <h4>Buzz</h4>
      <p>Google Buzz was Google's answer to Twitter, integrating right into Gmail and allowing users to post updates featuring text, links, photos, videos, etc. </p>
      <p>But it was a donkey.</p>
      <p>The reason it failed was simple: there was no competitive advantage over Twitter. </p>
      <p>There was no reason for users to move from <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/hey-google-heres-why-you-should-buy-twitter-quick.html">Twitter</a> to Google Buzz, and because of that, Buzz is another Google product that failed. </p>
      <h4>Google Talk</h4>
      <p>Google Talk was Google's chat interface that allowed people to instant message using text or voice.</p>
      <p>Similar to Google Reader, Google Talk (or Google Chat) had a few dedicated users that were sad to see the product be discontinued. </p>
      <p>This Google product didn't necessarily fail; Google simply wanted to drive Google Talk users over to the product it was putting its energy behind, Google Hangouts.</p>
      <h4>Orkut </h4>
      <p>Google Orkut was Google's Facebook-esque social media platform. </p>
      <p>But soon, Facebook was launched, and completely monopolized the friend-adding, status-sharing, photo-posting social media landscape.</p>
      <p>Facebook also offered a number of features that Orkut didn't, such as a like button to react to posts, notifications to see activity, and, most importantly, a simple, smooth user experience.</p>
      <p>Because Facebook simply did it better, Google Orkut was an attempt at a social media platform that failed. </p>
      <h4>Answers</h4>
      <p>Here's another situation in which Google just couldn't compete.</p>
      <p>Google Answers didn't have many users, because users had to pay money for answers. </p>
      <p>When free answer services that include a person-to-person element like Yahoo Answers exist, it's no wonder that a pay-for-answer service like Google Answers became another Google product that failed.</p>
      <h4>Dodgeball</h4>
      <p>Dodgeball was a site acquired by Google that was focused on location-specific social networking.</p>
      <p>It was a simple situation in which the hardware couldn't catch up with the idea or the need. </p>
      <p>After that, other platforms and functions -- such as "check in" on Facebook -- took the crowds that were interested in sharing those parts of their lives.</p>
      <h4>Allo</h4>
      <p>Google Allo was an incredibly interesting messaging service by Google that featured end-to-end encryption.</p>
      <p>The product even offered an Incognito mode in which messages would be deleted after a short time.</p>
      <p>People love their privacy, so in all honesty, this product was a great move by Google.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it is another Google product that failed.</p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>Google Allo failed because of the lack of optimization in its core features.</p>
      <p>For one, instead of making it possible to access a Google Allo account on more than one device, accounts were only tied to phone numbers, not Google accounts.</p>
      <p>But the main reason Allo became a Google product that failed is because Instead of adding SMS support to the app, Google created a separate SMS client.</p>
      <p>This meant that Allo users could only connect with other Allo users, which in the end, defeated the purpose for a lot of people.</p>
      <h4>Wave</h4>
      <p>Google Wave was a collaboration tool that, like many other Google products, simply didn't get the user activity that it needed to be supported. </p>
      <p>The main reason behind its failure was its invite-only feature.</p>
      <p>This meant that one could only become a user by invite, and Google simply did not promote the product to the best of their ability.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it became a product utilized mainly by techies, and the lack of user adoption meant that Google couldn't support this product that failed. </p>
      <h4>Inbox by Gmail</h4>
      <p>This one seems obvious. Inbox by Gmail is a Google product that failed simply because the separate email client was not necessary.</p>
      <p>Any features that Inbox by Gmail had could have been integrated into the <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/these-10-hidden-gmail-productivity-hacks-will-make.html">Gmail</a> app, so folks weren't rushing to use this service. </p>
      <h4>Chrome Apps</h4>
      <p>Google Chrome apps are yet another move by Google that were popular among a select audience for a short time, but just fizzled out.</p>
      <p>People stopped using Google Chrome apps, and it became less and less of a priority for Google to continue supporting these features.</p>
      <p>As we see from the other products that failed in this list, Google is not interested in spending money on things that don't increase revenue.</p>
      <p>That's a lesson to take to heart. </p>
      <h4>Nexus</h4>
      <p>Nexus was Google's answer to the Android smartphone.<br/>It was hyped significantly, but the launch failed to live up to the hype.</p>
      <p>Nexus failed for several reasons.</p>
      <p>It could only be purchased through the Google online store, despite being connected to a carrier.</p>
      <p>The carrier, however, was T-Mobile, which is possibly the weakest carrier in the country. </p>
      <p>Android is available on a number of smartphones -- in fact, there's still massive disagreements between Android and iPhone users.</p>
      <p>There was just no real compelling reason to purchase the Google Nexus, and the lack of sales resulted in the smartphone being another Google product that failed. </p>
      <h4>URL Shortener</h4>
      <p>Yet again, the failure of URL Shortener is an example of an instance in which Google could not compete with the growing number of URL shortening services on the web.</p>
      <p>As times change and the way people search and browse the internet change (particularly moving from desktop to mobile browsing), products and services need to catch up.</p>
      <p>There was no reason for Google to continue spending the money to support URL Shortener when more popular URL shortening services were being introduced to the market.</p>
      <h3>Finding the Lessons in Google's Donkeys </h3>
      <p>After reading this list of failures by one of the biggest companies in the world, one might feel discouraged -- but you should not.</p>
      <p>Yes, even Google can fail; even Google has created and produced products that flop. </p>
      <p>But that does not mean that every idea you will have as an <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/11-most-famous-entrepreneurs-of-all-time-and-what-made-them-wildly-rich.html">entrepreneur</a> will flop or fail.</p>
      <p>If we can learn anything from Google, it's that, in order to grow as a business, we must keep innovating to create our unicorns.</p>
