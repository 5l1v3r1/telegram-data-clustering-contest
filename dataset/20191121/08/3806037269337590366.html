      <h1>Michael B. Jordan Offers First Look at Upcoming Tom Clancy Film 'Without Remorse'</h1>
      <h2>Based on the novel of the same name.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:58:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:58</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Yeung</a></address>
      <p>Actor <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/michael-b-jordan">Michael B. Jordan</a> has just shared the first teaser for the upcoming film adaptation of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/tom-clancy">Tom Clancy</a>‘s novel <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/without-remorse"><i>Without Remorse</i></a>, where he’ll play the lead role of John Clark, an ex-Navy SEAL who became a CIA operative, and even served as Jack Ryan’s bodyguard at one point.</p>
      <p>Directed by Stefano Sollima, whose other works include <i>Sicario: Day of the Soldado</i>, and written by Taylor Sheridan, the film will follow the origin story of Tom Clancy’s second-most famous character, following Jack Ryan. The role was originally planned for Tom Hardy, but the deal subsequently fell through, and it went to Jordan instead. The character himself has actually been portrayed by several other actors such as Willem Dafoe, Liev Schreiber, and John Hoogenakker, but had never been the lead in any of those movies — until now.</p>
      <p><i>Without Remorse</i> is scheduled for release September 18, 2020. For the time being, check out its first teaser below.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in entertainment, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-in-works-joaquin-phoenix-todd-phillips">a <i>Joker</i> sequel is apparently not being developed</a>.</p>
