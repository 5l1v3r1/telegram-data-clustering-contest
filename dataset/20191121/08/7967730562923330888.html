      <p>Westpac chairman <b>Lindsay Maxsted</b> has plenty of grumpy stakeholders to manage after the bank was accused on Wednesday of breaching Australia’s anti-money laundering laws no less than 23 million times.</p>
      <p>We’re not predicting investors are going to go easy on the former accountant. They certainly have form.</p>
      <p>At the bank’s annual general meeting last year shareholders overwhelmingly voted down the remuneration plan for Westpac chief <b>Brian Hartzer</b> and other senior executives.</p>
      <p>Influential proxy advisory firms — which help large shareholders decide how to vote on executive pay and the election of directors — recommended institutions voice their displeasure over the findings of the Hayne Royal Commission.</p>
      <p>It turns out Maxsted and some of his fellow directors are booked in to check in with one of those firms — Institutional Shareholder Services — in Sydney on Monday. That’s just a few days since the financial crimes regulator launched legal action against Westpac.</p>
      <p>Last year ISS told its clients it was “difficult to discern” why Hartzer and other executives should receive their bonuses, citing reasons including “reputational damage”. We can’t wait to see what they say this year.</p>
      <p>Westpac sources said the meeting had been set up months in advance.</p>
      <p>Still, with pitchfork-wielding shareholders at the doorstep, every positive recommendation will count.</p>
      <p>Or perhaps any recommendation that doesn’t point out the bank’s management sat idly by while one customer used its services to allegedly funnel money to a man later arrested on child sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>As it stands, there is little enthusiasm about backing Hartzer’s bonuses or re-electing former Allens partner <b>Ewen Crouch</b>, the head of the board’s risk and compliance committee.</p>
      <p>Even with five directors up for election, Maxsted apparently intends to dial in to Monday’s proxy advisory meeting. We’d have thought he’d be wearing out his Ferragamos up and down Martin Place.</p>
