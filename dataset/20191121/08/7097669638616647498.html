      <h1>Russia opens investigation into space center fraud after Putin rebuke</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:27:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.reuters.com/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian investigators said on Thursday they had opened two criminal cases into the management of a company involved in building the Vostochny Cosmodrome, a space center in the country's Far East.</p>
      <p>The announcement came less than two weeks after President Vladimir Putin complained to government officials about corruption at the facility and called for further investigations.</p>
      <p>Construction of the Vostochny Cosmodrome began in January 2011, part of a plan for Russia to reduce its dependency on the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, which Russia leases from the former Soviet Republic for space operations.</p>
      <p>But Putin told government officials earlier this month he was dismayed by the level of graft there.</p>
      <p>"Hundreds of millions have been stolen. Hundreds of millions. Several dozen criminal cases have already been initiated. There have already been court decisions, people are in prison," said Putin.</p>
      <p>His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said later that 11 billion roubles ($172.45 million) of a total 91 billion roubles allocated to the project had been stolen.</p>
      <p>Investigators said on Thursday that they were looking into allegations that fraudulent financial documents had led to the theft of 240 million roubles ($3.8 million) between November 2018 and May 2019.</p>
      <p>Top officials at the Cosmodrome said they were in control of the situation and that any violations would immediately be passed to law enforcement officers, the RIA news agency reported.</p>
      <p>The Vostochny Cosmodrome, whose name comes from the Russian word meaning 'Eastern', is situated in the Amur region on the border with China.</p>
