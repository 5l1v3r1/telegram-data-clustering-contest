      <h1>Italy boss Roberto Mancini's bizarre transfer advice for Everton's Moise Kean</h1>
      <h2>Roberto Mancini thinks Moise Kean should leave Everton ahead of EURO 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:08:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:08</time> by <a rel="author">Caoimhe O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>Former Man City coach Roberto Mancini thinks Moise Kean needs to leave Everton.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the forward scored twice for Italy Under-21s, the national team manager revealed his hopes for the 19-year-old ahead of next summer's EURO 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>"I hope he finds a club that allows him to play regularly,” he told Rai Sport as cited by <a href="https://forzaitalianfootball.com/2019/11/mancini-advises-kean-to-leave-everton/">Forza Italian Football.</a></p>
      <p>"A lot will depend on what he does from now until May for the Euros."</p>
      <p>Kean, who joined the Blues from Juventus in the summer, scored <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-striker-moise-kean-sets-17285970">twice for Italy's Under-21s</a> on Tuesday in their 6-0 rout of Armenia.</p>
      <p>The teenager is still awaiting his first Everton goal having featured 11 times this term.</p>
      <p>But speaking after the win with the young Azzurri, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/moise-kean">Kean</a> believes he has provided the perfect response to any critics after his well-taken brace.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I need to do is show a response out on the pitch," <a href="https://www.figc.it/en/national-teams/news/nicolato-takes-after-mancini-another-high-scoring-affair-in-sicily-a-brace-for-kean-and-a-6-0-win-over-armenia/">the striker said</a>.</p>
      <p>"We played excellent football and need to continue in this manner.</p>
      <p>"Do I hope to be called up to the senior side? Of course, it’s everyone’s dream."</p>
