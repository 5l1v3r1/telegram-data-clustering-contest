      <h2>Joshua has the chance to exact revenge on Ruiz Jr after losing his world titles to the Mexican American in June</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:22:22+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:22</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Anthony Joshua will demand the boxing world "bows down" to him if he wins back his world titles.</p>
      <p>The former heavyweight champion has the chance to exact revenge on Andy Ruiz Jr when the rivals clash for a second time next month.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr pulled off one of the biggest shocks in boxing history in June when he knocked Joshua down four times before stopping him in the seventh round.</p>
      <p>The pair will meet again in two weeks' time in the Saudi Arabian desert, and Joshua told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11865835/ruiz-jr-vs-joshua-2-anthony-joshua-says-i-want-everybody-to-bow-to-me">Sky Sports</a> : "They think he's so great, so when I beat him I want everybody to bow to my feet and tell me how great I am."</p>
      <p>"I couldn't beat Ruiz Jr before and get the credit I deserved.</p>

      <p>"You saw me in the ring [before the fight] - I wasn't fighting King Kong, was I? [I didn't have] that mindset.</p>
      <p>"Apparently I'm fighting the quickest hands and the best fighter in the division. So once I beat him I want everybody to bow to me."</p>
      <p>Ruiz accepted the first fight at six weeks' notice after replacing drug cheat Jarrell Miller.</p>
      <p>Joshua was unable to adjust his training camp in time but insists this time his preparation has been on point.</p>

      <p>He said: "Take competition away from being humble. Being humble is about me respecting you as a person, or respecting a lady on a bus by standing up and giving her my seat. That's humble.</p>
      <p>"When you talk about competition, people understand and respect that you have to carry a sense of fire in your belly. It's not arrogance, it's confidence.</p>
      <p>"I'm confident that I know what I need to do now, and I've prepared to the best of my capability to go out and perform. Performance leads to the win."</p>
