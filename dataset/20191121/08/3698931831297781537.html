      <h1>Finally, a physical camera button on the iPhone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:22:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/nic/" target="_blank">Nic Ker</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/apple">Apple</a>‘s latest Smart Battery Cases for the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/iphone-11">iPhone 11</a> series are coming to Malaysia soon, and they bring an added piece of functionality to the iPhone—albeit one that has been around on Android phones for some time now. The latest Smart Battery Cases for the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max add a physical camera shortcut on the case, in addition to added battery life.</p>
      <p>The new dedicated camera button is placed near your right index finger when you hold the phone horizontally, and the Camera app is immediately opened even when your iPhone is locked. A longer press, meanwhile, allows you to take a “QuickTake” video.</p>

      <p>The Smart Battery Case also supports Qi-certified chargers, and can be charged simultaneously with your iPhone using a Lightning cable. When in use, the Smart Battery Case intelligent battery status is displayed on the lock screen and in the Notification Centre on your iPhone.</p>
      <p>The case for the iPhone 11 comes in Black and Soft White, while Pro models get colour options of Black, White, or Pink Sand. All 3 variants are priced at RM539, and Apple says that the Smart Battery Case will provide users with up to 50% longer battery life.</p>

      <p>The iPhone Smart Battery Cases are coming to <a href="https://apple.com/my">apple.com/my</a>, the Apple Store App, and selected Apple Authorised Resellers. At the moment, the cases are already listed on Apple’s website for RM539, but are still unavailable as of now.</p>
      <p>Most Android smartphones, of course, can double-press their power button (or other mappable shortcuts) to launch the camera app, and certain other Android smartphones have other creative ways to quick-launch the camera. While it’s certainly late, it’s nice to see Apple bringing over a feature that will certainly be appreciated by iPhone uses—provided they’re willing to fork over a sizeable price first.</p>
