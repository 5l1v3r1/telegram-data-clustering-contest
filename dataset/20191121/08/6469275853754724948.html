      <h1>Green light for plans for 280 homes in Lea</h1>

        <b>Plans for 280 homes in Lea were given the seal of approval despite Lancashire’s highways authority objecting to the build.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Highways had cited safety issues over access to the site earmarked for the scheme at land off Riversway and west of Dodney Drive.</p>
      <p>But members of Preston’s planning development committee voted in favour of giving the application the green light.</p>
      <p>Plans, which had been recommended for approval, explain how the entrance and exit to and from the site will be off Riversway via a T-junction with signals.</p>
      <p>Cars will be able to left turn in and out movements and but only right turn when leaving the development.</p>
      <p>Documents detail how a dedicated left turn lane will be provided on Riversway into the site.</p>
      <p>They state: “In order to facilitate westbound movements out of the site a link road would be constructed adjacent to Riversway to connect the site access to the roundabout to access the Preston Western Distributor Road (PWDR).”</p>
      <p>Lodging an objection to the application from Bulwark Ltd County, Highways stated in a report: “The access strategy is not considered suitable and is likely to result in operational or safety issues for those not familiar or not confident with large signalised multi-lane signalised junctions.”</p>
      <p>The report also details that the Highways authority at Lancashire County Council felt the proposed access would be improved if there was a second access road to the site to connect to North Syke Avenue.</p>
      <p>But officers at Preston City Council had recommended the development for approval stating: “It appears that the requirement for a secondary vehicular access is based on driver competence and it would be difficult to evidence why the proposed main and only vehicular access is unacceptable.”</p>
