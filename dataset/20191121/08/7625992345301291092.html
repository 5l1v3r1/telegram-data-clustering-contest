      <p>"So good and so good for you. Every time I make these power bites, I am begged for the recipe.</p>
      <p>"They are a hit with both kids and adults, and always disappear quickly.</p>
      <p>"For a real superfood treat, add 1 teaspoon spirulina powder and 1 teaspoon maca root powder to the mix. Spirulina will make the mixture turn green, but the essential amino acids it provides for your brain are worth a little color!"</p>
