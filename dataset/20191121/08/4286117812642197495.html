      <p>A prospective common minimum programme being prepared by the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress has a major thrust on loan waivers, sources in the Congress and the NCP said.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra's share in the cost of building the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail line -- 25 per cent -- will be given to farmers, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The project's estimated cost is Rs 1.08 lakh crore; it is being built with help from Japan (through a loan) and is expected to be completed by 2023. Both the Congress and the Shiv Sena have opposed the bullet train project.</p>

        <b>POLITICAL INSTABILITY NEARING END?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maharashtra was placed under President's Rule this month, following a prolonged delay in government formation in the wake of an October state election that the Shiv Sena and the BJP won together.</p>
      <p>But the two former allies fell out bitterly, unable to agree that the chief minister's job should be shared using a rotation policy.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday said a final decision on a new Maharashtra government would be taken in two days.</p>
