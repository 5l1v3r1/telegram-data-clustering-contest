      <h3>The DLC is planned for a release next month.</h3>
      <p><i>Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot</i> is the first DLC pack heading to <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/borderlands-3/"><i>Borderlands 3</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The first of four DLC packs, <i>Moxxi’s Heist </i>will be available from 19 December and is included in both the <i>Borderlands 3</i> Season Pass and Super Deluxe Edition.</p>
      <p>Here’s what the DLC will bring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pull off the Ultimate Casino Heist: Moxxi’s assembling a crew to plunder a derelict space station casino and you’ve proven yourself worthy of joining her ragtag team of “experts.” Successfully battle your way through Hyperion security forces and crazed casino-goers to reach a safe loaded with Eridium, cash, and all-new Legendary loot.</li>
        <li>The Handsome Jackpot: This once-thriving destination is packed with unique zones worthy of Handsome Jack’s lavish lifestyle and dirty dealings but has been on total lockdown since his death.</li>
        <li>You Need access to Sanctuary 3: To reach The Handsome Jackpot you need to have played enough of the <i>Borderlands 3</i> story to have access to Sanctuary 3. The enemies and loot aboard the station will scale to your Vault Hunter’s level, ensuring that the casino heist missions and new Crew Challenges are suitably difficult and rewarding.</li>
        <li>Beat Casino Security: Get a blast from Pandora’s past when you battle the Hyperion forces that outlived Handsome Jack, including never-before-seen enemies and larger-than-life bosses.</li>
        <li>All-New Loot: Walk away with Legendary weapons and gear and expand your collection of customization items with Vault Hunter Heads &amp; Skins, Weapon Trinkets, an ECHO Device Skin, and new Emotes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/borderlands-3/">Borderlands 3</a> </i>is currently available on Windows PC, Xbox One and PS4.</p>
