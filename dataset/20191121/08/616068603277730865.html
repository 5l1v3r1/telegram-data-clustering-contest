      <p>Snowboard pioneer and founder of Burton Snowboards,  </p>
      <p>Jake Burton Carpenter has passed away at the age of 65-years-old.</p>
      <p>Burton Snowboard officials made the announcement, “It is with a very heavy heart that I share the news that Jake passed away peacefully last night surrounded by his family and loved ones as a result of complications from recurring cancer. He was our founder, the soul of snowboarding, the one who gave us the sport we all love so much," says John Lacy, Burton’s co-chief executive officer. </p>
      <p>Burton Carpenter emailed his staff this month saying his testicular cancer had returned.</p>
      <p>Burton Carpenter brought the snowboard to the masses and helped turn the sport into a billion-dollar business. He quit his job in New York in 1977 to form his company. His goal was to advance the rudimentary snowboard, then called a “Snurfer,” which had been invented by Sherman Poppen a dozen years earlier.</p>
