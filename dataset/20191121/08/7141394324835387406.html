      <p>From a big bet on Bitcoin to the friendly competition between Ethereum and XRP, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bitcoin</b>
      </p>
      <p>A popular margin trader on the crypto exchange BitMEX says he’s taking a $4-million bet on Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>The trader, known in the industry as Flood, <a href="https://twitter.com/ThinkingUSD/status/1197323083683487744">tells</a> his 72,800 followers on Twitter that he’s now long on BTC and took the multi million-dollar position when the leading crypto hit $8,105.</p>

      <p>In the long term, a former Wall Street trader and vice president at JP Morgan Chase, Tone Vays, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM9uYBUo0b8">says</a> Bitcoin remains in a descending channel. He’s looking for BTC to move as low as $5,000.</p>
      <p>Vays has been consistently bearish on the king coin throughout 2019 and says he’s looking forward to becoming a bull.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“At the moment, I’m still looking for $5,000, but not necessarily this year. We have about a month and a half to go, maybe even less. I am looking for that $5,000, more like January or February to finally, finally say I am no longer a bear.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>You can say that that happened a year later than it should have. But the low a year ago was $3,000. If the secondary low comes in at $4,500 to $5,000, I’ll be ok with that. I’d rather be a year late at approximately the same price and I’m perfectly fine with that.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ripple, XRP and Ethereum</b>
      </p>
      <p>The CEO of the Malta-based crypto exchange CoinField says he’s a fan of both Ethereum and XRP.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/xrp-has-better-technology-than-ethereum-says-ceo-of-crypto-exchange-coinfield/">saying</a> XRP has “better technology” than Ethereum in a recent interview, Bob Ras took to <a href="https://twitter.com/DiepSanh/status/1196724180856623104">Twitter</a> to say he’s a fan of both networks.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The fact that we’ve selected the XRP Ledger over Ethereum doesn’t mean Ether has weak technology! We needed to offer the fastest and most cost-efficient solution within [the] Sologenic ecosystem to move liquidity in additional to the basic smart contract capability. The choice was XRP.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>CoinField recently fired up a Ripple-approved validator on the XRP Ledger as it gears up to launch Sologenic.</p>
      <p>The platform is designed to let people trade thousands of tokenized versions of stocks and ETFs against both XRP and a new token called SOLO.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tron</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tron creator Justin Sun has issued one of his trademark pre-announcement announcements.</p>
      <p>Sun is promising to reveal a new acquisition soon and says he’s already sealed the deal. Tron’s most noteworthy acquisition came in July of last year, when the company bought the decentralized file-sharing platform BitTorrent for more than $100 million.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Stellar</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Stellar Development Foundation <a href="https://galactictalk.org/d/2194-stellar-community-fund-round-3-guidelines">says</a> it’s gearing up to give away 3,000,000 of its native crypto asset XLM.</p>
      <p>It will be handed to developers and entrepreneurs looking to build on the network.</p>
      <p>The deadline to submit proposals is December 14th and the winners will be announced in January.</p>
