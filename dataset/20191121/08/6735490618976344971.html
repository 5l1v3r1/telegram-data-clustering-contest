      <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/game-thrones-cast-filmed-alternative-ending-season-8-well-never-see-reveals-tormund-star-kristofer-hivju-11179830/"><i>Metro UK</i></a>, Tormund actor Kristofer Hivju reveals that the cast actually shot an ending that was never meant to air.</p>
      <p>“Well, we shot an alternative ending,” Hivju said. “That was mostly for fun but I don’t know if I’m allowed to tell you about that.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he could give any details about the alternate ending, the actor said “I won’t tell you! But it was fun.”</p>

      <p>Hivju did say that he was surprised by where the real ending of the series went, but in a good way.</p>
      <p>“The funny thing is, after season 7 I had my theories, fans had theirs, everybody, the cast had their theories so there were thousands of theories,” he said. “To choose one path would be difficult to say but there were many things I didn’t see coming; there was the element of surprise, which I liked.”</p>
      <p>The series finale of “Game of Thrones” aired in May. A prequel series called “House of the Dragon” is currently in the works.</p>
