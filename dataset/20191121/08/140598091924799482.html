      <p>The dust is finally settling on a momentous 24 hours in the history of Tottenham Hotspur during which Mauricio Pochettino was<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/jose-mourinho-appointed-tottenham-manager-replace-mauricio-pochettino/"> replaced as manager by Jose Mourinho</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/jose-mourinho-tottenham-fan-view-case-against-new-manager/">Once the fans have have got over any preconceptions </a>about the former Chelsea and Manchester United manager - or even got on board with his appointment - thoughts must turn towards Saturday's game against West Ham... and beyond.</p>
      <p>We've been here before. Quite a few times, in fact. This the ninth different job of Mourinho's managerial career. And there are a fair few themes across the board.</p>
      <p>Here's what Tottenham fans should expect of the Jose Mourinho regime.</p>
      <h3>Upturn in results</h3>
      <p>The immediate hope for any club changing coach is that he brings with him a new manager 'bounce'. Mourinho promises exactly that.</p>
      <p>In his last six posts - at Porto, Chelsea (x2), Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Manchester United, he has not lost a single one of his opening four matches, garnering 19 wins from 24 games.</p>

      <p>His opening 10 games across his eight managerial positions have brought 48 wins, while the majority of his defeats came in his first three roles - all in Portugal, at Benfica, Uniao Leiria and Porto, and a long time ago. Since leaving his homeland, Mourinho has lost only six times in matches that fell within the opening 10 games of his reign - a loss rate of just 12 per cent.</p>
      <p>Tottenham fans loved Pochettino for the long-term vision he gave the club, but that's not Mourinho's style. He aims for short-term gains and gets them. With Tottenham 14th in the Premier League and already 11 points off the top four, instant results are desperately needed.</p>
      <h3>Makes significant changes to the team</h3>
      <p>Every manager wants to stamp his mark on a new team and Mourinho is no different.</p>
      <p>In his last five managerial posts, he has made at least four changes to the starting lineup in the final game of the previous regime, and often more.</p>
      <p>The difference this time around is, for the first time since becoming Benfica manager in 2000, Mourinho is taking over a club mid-season, and will not be able to bring any new recruits in straight away.</p>

      <p>However, Pochettino got into the swing of rotating heavily over the last couple of seasons and given how poor the performance was in his final game - against Sheffield United - there are plenty of candidates to be dropped in Mourinho's first game in charge.</p>
      <h3>Win a trophy</h3>
      <p>It will take something major for the fans to be won over by Mourinho, but his trophy record suggests he could provide some sought-after silverware that eluded Pochettino's Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Titles are clearly a major part of Daniel Levy's thinking behind this appointment. Tottenham's announcement on Wednesday morning proclaimed Mourinho to be "one of the world’s most accomplished managers having won 25 senior trophies," and adding to that tally will be the aim over the next couple of years.</p>
      <p>Wherever Mourinho has gone, he has won trophies and Levy will expect him to repeat the trick having given him this gig when so many people now doubt his ability in the modern game.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has won at least one trophy in his first season in each of his six stints that lasted more than a year, and at least two trophies in total at each job.</p>
      <h3>Things turn sour a few seasons in</h3>
      <p>Mourinho's instant impact tends to tail off pretty dramatically. He often starts very well, and then even improves further in his second season, but then things start to implode. His win percentage always rises in his second campaign but then falls off a cliff.</p>
      <p>Only once before in his managerial career has he lasted more than three campaigns at a single club, and the one time he did manage that - his first stint at Chelsea - their results in his fourth season were atrocious.</p>
      <p>He has been sacked midway through or after a poor third season in each of his last three positions - at Real Madrid, Chelsea and United - and there certainly won't be any thoughts of a legacy being built in north London.</p>
      <h3>Leaves the club in a state</h3>
      <p>If Mourinho does one thing well, it's go down swinging. He doesn't mind who he takes down with him, but as long as he causes maximum destruction on his way out of a club he is satisfied.</p>
      <p>Only once in his last five roles has he won more than two of his final five matches in charge, while he also tends to leave teams with an older team, often having stuck by a core group of players.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, that isn't the case at either of his two most recent clubs, where he has reduced the age of his starting lineup. Naturally, however, bringing down the average age costs money.</p>
