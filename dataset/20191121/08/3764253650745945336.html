        <b>Deontay Wilder, WBC heavyweight champion, has been caught in an explosive Instagram live rant where he criticized Mike Tyson's boxing record after his ability in the ring was questioned by fans.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mike "Iron Mike" Tyson is considered as one of the boxing legends who brought class and aggression to the game but during a live IG rant dated back to 2017, the 53-year-old's quality was called out by his fellow American.</p>

      <p>Bronze Bomber, who has often been compared with Tyson because of their similar formidable qualities, lost his patience when a fan argue he was far off the level of Mike.</p>
      <p>Wilder got infuriated and reduced himself into an astonishing rant while teaching his fans about boxing history.</p>
      <p><i>"Folks ... don't know your history about... when it comes to the sport of boxing, let's face it: you do not know your history,"</i> the 34-year-old said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We love Mike Tyson, of course. We love 'em all. You know what I'm saying? I love 'em all. We love 'em all. They did a great job. [...] But go back and look up your facts.</i>

      <p>Wilder later went on to rant about Mike's defeat to Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield in his professional boxing career before demanding fans do their research.</p>
      <p><i>"Only two," </i>Wilder yelled down the camera.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Only two. Only two. Holyfield beat him twice and Lennox beat him.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"Only two. So what the f**k y'all talking about?" </i>Bronze Bomber said.</p>
      <p>Wilder, a knock out king, has once <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276701-canelo-alvarez-mexican-champ-boasts-beat-floyd-mayweather-rematch.html">vowed to break Floyd Mayweather's record</a> for the longest undefeated streak of win.</p>

      <p>But the highlight of the pre-fight show was the 32-year-old's bizarre cloth suggesting he is full of confidence of another win over Ortiz.</p>
