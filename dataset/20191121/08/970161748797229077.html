        <b>50 Cent has confirmed there will be a Power spin-off and it appears a major character will survive and perhaps even go on to become the new Ghost.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The In Da Club rapper made his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/50-cent-trolling-hard-instagram-decided-disable-account-11163463">grand return to Instagram on Wednesday after dramatically deleting his account,</a> and one of his first posts was a photo from the set of Power Book II, the sequel to the main series which ends in 2020.</p>
      <p>In the behind-the-scenes snap, 50 – real name Curtis Jackson – is seen posing with actor Michael Rainey Jr, who plays Ghost’s son Tariq in Power. Alongside them is actor Gianni Paolo who plays Tariq’s roommate at boarding school in the current season 6.</p>
      <p>‘On set of Power Book ll right now you know the vibes. #lecheminduroi#bransoncognac STARZ get the app,’ 50 Cent captioned the image before deleting it, possibly realising he’d given too much away.</p>

      <p>The photo appears to confirm that Tariq will survive the dramatic events of the main Power season and adds weight to the theory that the teen will step into his father’s shoes and become the new Ghost.</p>
      <p>In recent episodes, Tariq has been ‘learning the drug game’ from his mother Tasha St Patrick (Naturi Naughton) and is gunning for his father James ‘Ghost’ St Patrick.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/shot-ghost-power-theories-cliffhanger-will-happen-next-11052396/">Power’s latest midseason finale ended with Ghost being shot</a> in his New York nightclub Truth, with each suspect – including Tariq – seen walking to the club with guns in hand. It looked as though Ghost saw his shooter but viewers will have to wait until Power returns in January to find out who pulled the trigger.</p>

      <p>Fans of the hit Starz series have been running wild with theories as to who tried to kill the reformed drug kingpin, and his son Tariq is a hot contender.</p>
      <p>50 Cent, who played Ghost’s frenemy Kanan until season 5, teased the direction of Power Book II back in September.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, the TV producer teased: ‘It does not make sense to even market or promote the idea of it ending when it’s growing so fast.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Like this year, the first episode of Power came in 40 percent over its last season’s viewership. The show is still growing, so there’s no reason for you to say that it’s gonna end, ’cause it’s not.’</p>
      <p>He added of the Power finale: ‘It’s gonna be intense, man. You gotta buckle up and prepare for the ride. It’s a roller coaster. There’s so many different cool moments in it that I think … OK, I’ll tell you the truth: I think my episode is the best. I think I’m the best. I think I’m 50 Scorsese.’</p>
