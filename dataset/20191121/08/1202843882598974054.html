      <p>Rising batting star Babar Azam has said his team are in ‘good form’ as Pakistan get ready to face in-form Australia in the first of two Tests starting in Brisbane today.</p>
      <p>With scores of 63, 157*, 6, 50, 59*, 34, 83 in the last one month, Azam is Pakistan’s main hope against the fiery pace of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.</p>
      <p>A new-look Pakistan - under coach Misbah-ul-Haq - have arrived in Australia with a young side that includes captain Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq as the other two batsmen with experience of playing Test matches Down Under.</p>
      <p>Australia, on the other hand, will see captain Tim Paine relying on batting stalwarts Steve Smith and David Warner to unsettle the young Pakistan bowling side that includes 16-year-old bowling sensation Nasim Shah.</p>
      <p>“We are in good form. The practice matches have helped us. The attempt was to play long innings as that is good. We wanted to soak in the atmosphere and we did that. The wickets here are different. We have been practising looking at the playing conditions here in Australia,” Azam, 24, said in an interview before the first Test.</p>
      <p>“The competition (between Australia and Pakistan) will be really exciting. Our batsmen have been doing well and so is our bowlers. Our young bowlers have shown good early season form. The aim is to bat in the Tests in the way we have batted in the warm-up games,” Azam, who averages more than 50 in One-Day internationals and T20 cricket, added.</p>
      <p>When asked about the side’s challenges, Azam said minor tweaks as opposed to major technical changes can help his team blunt the Australian pace attack.</p>
      <p>“There is no such difficulty (playing Australian fast bowlers) because we know there is more bounce and pace in the wickets. The adjustment is the key and the more you play, the more you practice, the better you get in these conditions. These are small adjustments to be made,” said Pakistan captain.</p>
      <p>“My goal always is to perform well. The way I am batting, I hope to replicate that form in the Test matches as well. Australia have quality bowlers and batsmen and they do well in their own conditions. Their bowlers know how to bowl at home. My target and aim is to play positive cricket,” Azam told in the interview posted on Pakistan Cricket Board’s official Twitter handle.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar praised the spirit shown by young pacer Naseem whose mother passed away in Pakistan last week. Despite his personal grief, Naseem decided to stay on with the Pakistan side and play the warm-up game against Australia A at Perth.</p>
      <p>“Pakistan have played side matches and the bowlers have also done well. Nasim Shah can be a good addition to our bowling. He has firepower and understands the game. He could do well. He is young. He is fast,” Akhtar said on his Youtube channel.</p>
      <p>“What is good about him is he understands bowling. Mohammed Amir was also the same at his age. I thought of retiring when Amir and (Mohammed) Asif were in the side and they knew so much about fast bowling in 2008. They could get top batsmen out with ease and won Pakistan many matches,”</p>
      <p>Akhtar, who played 46 Tests and grabbed 178 wickets, added: “But it is too early to make a call on Shah. I wish him best of luck though. He has shown courage to play on after knowing his mother has passed away,” Akhtar, 44, said.</p>
      <p>“I wish him the best of luck. In Australia every fast bowler gets hammered. But I hope he can win appreciation by being brave and courageous. Pakistan have done well in the side games in which Asad Shafiq and Babar Azam have piled on the runs. It feels good,” said Akhtar.</p>

      <p>"Pakistan have got a knack of finding these young fast bowlers so it looks like they have another one to add to that rich history of fast bowlers that they seem to produce."</p>
