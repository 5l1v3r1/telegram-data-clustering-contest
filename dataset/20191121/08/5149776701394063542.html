      <h1>'Not been convincing' - The challenge Nottingham Forest can expect against Bristol City</h1>
      <h2>A trip to Ashton Gate is next up for Sabri Lamouchi's Reds after the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:29:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:29</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest will look to pick up where they left off, when they return from the international break on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Reds went into the two-week respite on the back of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottinham-forest-derby-county-analysis-3521884">successive wins</a>, and will hope to keep that run going when they make the trip to Bristol City this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a>’s men sit just above their opponents in the Championship table, in fifth place, with the teams separated only by goal difference.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the game at Ashton Game, we got the lowdown on the Robins from Bristol Live’s City correspondent Gregor MacGregor.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How would you assess City's season so far? What have performances been like?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The performances have not been convincing for Bristol City, but they have been consistent. And results have been good.</p>
      <p>Given the club's business in the summer and a high turnaround of key players, the Robins have done well and supporters are happy with how things are going.</p>
      <p>The club has been vocal about trying to finish in the top six and so far that looks achievable.</p>
      <p>It's just been two losses so far this season, and there are plenty of good statistics showing City's progress this campaign.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Do you think a top six finish is a real possibility this time?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's a possibility, for sure, given how the team is performing.</p>
      <p>To have played a third of the season and missing plenty of key players yet only lose twice so far shows the good work that the coaching staff are doing.</p>
      <p>The Robins have recently had <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/great-story-bristol-city-injury-3555492">several important players return from injury</a> - Tomas Kalas, Adam Nagy and now Korey Smith - and will get Famara Diedhiou back for this weekend after his three-match ban, so things are looking up players-wise.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Has anything changed much this season?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lee Johnson is now the seventh longest-serving boss in England's four leagues, and there have been a few backroom changes (new fitness coach Patrick Orme and addition of KAliffa Cisses to the backroom staff).</p>
      <p>But chiefly it's been on the playing side, where good prospect Lloyd Kelly was sold to Bournemouth and key defender Adam Webster joined Brighton, that changes have been made.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How will they approach Saturday's game and who will Forest need to watch out for?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/dangerous-bristol-city-coach-issues-3556364">The Robins will obviously attack</a> but their home form has not matched their away performances over the last 18 months or so.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Fans and myself would like to see a quicker start made and more high-tempo attacking early on at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>Andi Weimann, a former Derby striker of course, is City's top scorer and the man who leads the press, working furiously as he does.</p>
      <p>Weimann will need careful marshalling, and he obviously netted last season on his debut in this same fixture.</p>
      <p>City also have history on their side, winning six of the last nine league meetings against <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a>.</p>
      <p>Niclas Eliasson has the equal most assists this season and, if he plays, could be a match-winner for the home side.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Likely line-up?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Should be: Bentley; Hunt, Williams, Moore, Rowe; Eliasson, Brownhill, Nagy, O'Dowda; Weimann, Diedhiou</p>
      <p>
        <b>What's your score prediction?</b>
      </p>
      <p>2-1; though City are unconvincing at home and we could see Forest grabbing something.</p>
