      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Powerful. Quiet. Supports Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Adjustable LED white temperature.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Poor installation instructions. Installation requires wiring knowledge. Doesn't support IFTTT or integrate with other smart devices.</p>
      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>The Carro Smart Ceiling Fan is an attractive 60-inch fan that you can control with your voice and with your phone. It's a solid performer, but it doesn't work with other smart devices and it could use more detailed instructions.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The Carro Smart Ceiling Fan ($499) is a 60-inch Wi-Fi-enabled fan powered by a whisper-quiet ten-speed motor. It features a dimmable LED <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/lighting/41566/the-best-smart-light-bulbs">smart light</a> module with cool and warm white temperature settings, and can be controlled using an included remote, a mobile app, and Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. The powerful fan and bright light worked well in testing, but the installation was harder than it needed to be due to incorrect and incomplete instructions. Moreover, the Carro isn't quite as smart as the more expensive <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/consumer-electronics-reviews-ratings/84499/review/big-ass-fans-haiku-i-series">Big Ass Fans Haiku I Series</a>.</p>
      <h3>Design and Features</h3>
      <p>The Carro is a 60-inch fan that uses three airfoil blades to cool down your home. The blades are black and have a sleek, sculpted look, but they are made of ABS plastic, whereas the Haiku blades are made of a glass-infused composite material. The fan is powered by a ten-speed reversible motor with a range of 60-220rpm and uses an 802.11n Wi-Fi radio to connect to your home network. The 20-watt dimmable LED module has warm (2700k) and cool (5700k) white temperature settings and a 1500-lumen output.</p>
      <p>You also get a five-button remote control that you can use to turn the fan and lights on or off, set fan speed, select cool or warm light settings, and dim the lights. The fan also comes with two extension tubes (long and short), a mounting bracket and mounting screws, a canopy and a wiring cover, an AC adapter, and an installation guide (more on this later).</p>

      <p>You can use Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands to turn the fan on and off and change speeds, but you can't use your voice to control the LED light module. Other than Alexa and Google voice support, the fan doesn't work with any third-party smart devices, nor does it support <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/internet-3/14436/ifttt">IFTTT</a> applets. By way of comparison, the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/consumer-electronics-reviews-ratings/86905/review/hunter-signal-54-inch-ceiling-fan">Hunter Signal 54-inch Ceiling Fan</a> works with the Apple HomeKit platform, while the Haiku Series I Fan works with Ecobee thermostats and contains temperature and humidity sensors.</p>
      <p>In addition to voice commands and the included remote, the fan can be controlled using the Carro Home app for Android and iOS devices. It opens to a home screen that displays tabs of all of your Carro Home devices by name. The fan tab has an on/off button for the fan, but not for the light. Tap the tab to open a screen with a large fan icon, an on/off button, and yellow (warm) and white (cool) light buttons that are labeled in Chinese.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>At the bottom of the screen are buttons for Wind Speed (fan speed), Summer/Winter Mode, Sleep Mode, and Timer. Tap the Wind Speed button to select a fan speed level from one to eight, and tap the Summer/Winter Mode button to change the fan direction from upward flow to downward flow. The Sleep Mode doesn't appear to do anything at all, and the Timer button lets you set an off timer for between one and seven hours.</p>
      <p>Back at the home screen there are Home, Smart, and Me buttons along the bottom edge. The Home button takes you back to the home screen, and the Smart button takes you to a screen where you can create Scenes to turn the fan on or off, change direction, change fan speed, or set a timer. Here you can also create Automations to have the fan react to things like local temperature and humidity levels, and turn on or off at sunset or sunrise, and you can create schedules to have the fan turn on or off or execute a Scene or Automation at a specific time of day. However, you can't control the light with Scenes or Automations. The Me button takes you to a screen where you can change profile and network settings, add users, and view help files.</p>
      <h3>Installation and Performance</h3>
      <p>As with other ceiling fans, installing the Carro Smart Fan requires knowledge of electrical wiring, so if you're not familiar with how to shut down your power and correctly wire electrical components, you should have a professional install it. I've installed numerous ceiling fans in my house over the years and have always considered it a fairly easy DIY task, but the Carro fan was more difficult than it needed to be due to a lack of detail in the written instructions.</p>
      <p>Assembling the fan blades and LED light kit was relatively easy, but things got dicey when it came to attaching the downrod and connecting it to the LED assembly. For starters, there is no mention of how to swap out the long downrod with the shorter downrod, which was necessary for my installation as I have eight-foot ceilings (the longer rod would make the fan hang dangerously low). I knew from past experience that I had to remove the half-circle coupling from the longer rod and attach it to the shorter rod, but if you've never done this before, there's no way to know how to proceed.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the instructions for attaching the downrod to the motor assembly are wrong. They direct you to put the bolts in place and then put two washers in front of each fastening nut, but you have to use one washer after the bolt head and the second washer before the nut, otherwise the wiring cover will not fit over the fasteners and wires will be exposed (I found this out the hard way).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Once the fan was fully assembled, I turned off the power to the circuit and removed my old fan. I attached the mounting bracket to the junction box and hung the fan from the bracket by inserting the round downrod coupling into the round groove on the bracket. I slid the power adapter into the slot on the bracket, connected it to the house wiring and to the downrod connector, tucked the wires into the canopy, and attached the canopy to the mounting bracket using the included screws. I turned the power back on and the physical installation was complete.</p>
      <p>Following the written instructions, I downloaded the mobile app, created an account, tapped Add Device, and selected the Smart Fan. I verified my Wi-Fi SSID, entered my password, and followed the instructions to connect to the fan's SSID using my phone's Wi-Fi settings. However, once again, the instructions were incorrect. They directed me to press the W button on the remote to enter Wi-Fi pairing mode, but there is no W button on the remote. Through trial and error I discovered it was the Yellow button. I was then unable to find the Carro Home SSID in my Wi-Fi settings as the instructions stated; instead, it showed up as Smart Life, which I selected and was immediately connected.</p>
      <p>I installed the fan in my 20-by-12 foot living room and its 60-inch airfoils and 220rpm motor did a fantastic job of cooling the room down quickly and quietly. The fan responded immediately to app and remote control commands, and I had no trouble turning the fan on and off and changing fan speeds using Alexa voice commands.</p>
      <p>I created a Scene to change the fan speed to three with a single button press and it worked perfectly. I also create an Automation to have the fan turn on when the local temperature reading hit 70 degrees, and it too worked like a charm. Unfortunately, there is no way to control the light using Scenes or Automations.</p>
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>The Carro Smart Fan delivers solid upward and downward airflow and its powerful motor is very quiet. The fan responds quickly to app and remote commands, and voice control works well, but the inability to control the light with your voice or with Scenes and Automations is a glaring omission. Additionally, the installation guide needs a major retooling. If you're looking for a ceiling fan with a few more smarts, consider the Haiku Series I from Big Ass Fans. It's more expensive than the Carro Smart Fan, but it offers smart lighting control and is equipped with temperature and humidity sensors and integrates with Ecobee smart thermostats. And if you're looking to save money, the Hunter Signal is a solid option, though it doesn't offer much more in the way of smarts.</p>
