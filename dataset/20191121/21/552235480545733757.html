      <p>Jordan Jones has returned to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> training after a knee injury which kept him out of action for almost three months.</p>
      <p>The winger was sent off late on in the defeat to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> in September, after a violent tackle on Moritz Bauer.</p>
      <p>It was the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> man who came off the worse in the incident though, suffering a knee injury which has kept him out of the side since.</p>
      <p>Today though the Northern Ireland international returned to training and expressed his delight on his Instagram page.</p>
      <p>Jones wrote: "Long hard 12 weeks out but buzzing to be back training today."</p>
      <p>He'll now be in contention for Rangers' upcoming games - though he may have a job forcing his way back into manager Steven Gerrard's plans.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox gaffer was furious about his red card and subsequent injury and warned <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jordan-jones">Jones</a> would have to prove himself all over again.</p>
      <p>Gerrard said: "He totally deserved it. It has come from frustration but if you are Jordan Jones and you want fans on your side, you create and score goals.</p>
      <p>""That's how you get fans on your side - not kicking people when the ball's ten yards away.</p>
      <p>"He deserves the red card, he deserves the ban and he's got everything to do now to get back into my team."</p>
