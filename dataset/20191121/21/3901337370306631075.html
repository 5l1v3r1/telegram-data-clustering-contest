      <p>Sierra Leone striker Mohamed Buya Turay, who has been in fine goalscoring form for Swedish club Djurgarden, has blamed black magic for a recent leg injury that ruled him out of his nation's 1-0 AFCON qualifier defeat to Benin.</p>
      <p>"I've almost fully recovered from my injury," Buya told <i>BBC Sport.</i></p>
      <p>"I had no toe injury when I played against Lesotho because no one stepped on me or kicked me.</p>
      <p>"But I started feeling pain on my toe when I returned to the hotel where the team were camped the following day.</p>

      <p>"I informed the team's physiotherapist who couldn't figure out what was wrong, and the pain got heavier when we were on the bus heading for the training ground.</p>
      <p>"The pain worsened when we arrived at the training ground, it extended to the whole foot and leg, and I then decided to call some of my family members who took me to a woman native doctor.</p>
      <p>"The native doctor told me that the cause of toe injury was because I stepped on a spiritual object in Leone Stars camp, put there for me by a person who wanted me to get elephantiasis, thereby destroying my career.</p>
      <p>"She further told me that if I had gone to the hospital for treatment or had used conventional medicine to try and heal the toe, that would have ended my career."</p>
