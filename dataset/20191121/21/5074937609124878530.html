      <h1>Hajj Board retains 2019 fare for next year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:02:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Samiratu Larbie, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 21, GNA - The Hajj Board of Ghana has announced that pilgrims to the 2020 Hajj will pay the same fare of Gh̸19,500.00 as those of last year.</p>
      <p>Sheikh I.C Quaye, the Chairman of the Board, who made this known, said this was due to Government's decision to absorb the incremental difference.</p>
      <p>The Chairman made the announcement at a thanksgiving ceremony in Accra for a successful Hajj in 2019.</p>
      <p>He said the move by the Government was in spite of a decision by the Saudi authorities to increase the visa fees for the 2020 pilgrims by $80.</p>
      <p>The decision, he said, was made in consultation with the Hajj Board and the Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.</p>
      <p>He said previous Hajj Boards had over the years been faced with debt overhang, adding that, with this phenomenon the current Board changed its strategy.</p>
      <p>“We hope to end our tenure without any debt overhang even though we inherited huge debt from our predecessors,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sheikh Quaye expressed gratitude to the President Akufo-Addo for putting measures in place to ensure that some 452 prospective pilgrims who could not travel, although they paid their monies in 2017, were given the opportunity.</p>
      <p>They were working with support from the welfare endowment to ensure that their credibility was untainted, he said.</p>
      <p>He announced  that Dawah teams had been set up to secure the spiritual and physical well-being of all Ghanaian pilgrims.</p>
      <p>Measures had been put in place to curb issues of missing luggage, as well.</p>
      <p>The Saudi officials, he said, had awarded Ghana a top prize for emerging as one of the leading countries that organised the best Hajj in 2019.</p>
      <p>In attendance at the event was the National Chief Imam, regional chief imams, Sheikh Dr Amin Bonsu, Sariki's from the Zongo communities, among other eminent persons.</p>
