      <p>A murder investigation has begun after a man was found dead at his home in Bangor, Co Down.</p>
      <p>Mike Kerr (68), was discovered at the property in Birch Drive on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>PSNI detective chief inspector Michelle Shaw said: “<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Michael+Kerr">Michael Kerr</a>, commonly referred to as Mike by friends and family, was found dead at his home in Bangor on Tuesday night and as a result of the postmortem examination I have launched a murder investigation.</p>
      <p>“My thoughts are with his family at this difficult time and I am appealing to the public for information. I would particularly like to hear from anyone who knew Mr Kerr or who saw him in the days leading up to Tuesday, when his body was discovered.</p>
      <p>“If you saw anything suspicious in the area, please let me know.”</p>
      <p>Green Party North Down Assembly member Rachel Woods said: “The murder of Michael Kerr has shocked and saddened our community.</p>
      <p>“My thoughts are with his family members. I appreciate that Mr Kerr’s death would have come as a huge shock to his family and friends.</p>
      <p>“That shock will be heightened by the fact that police are now investigating Mr Kerr’s death as murder.” – PA</p>
