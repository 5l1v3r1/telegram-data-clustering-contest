      <p>After learning their parents died in an attempt to discover more about the source of her powers, Elsa pushes away her sister Anna for her own safety. Anna and Olaf end up lost in the forest and trapped in a large cave, while Elsa continues on north alone. Upon reaching the Black Sea, she tries to cross it. Confronted by the water element Nokk, Elsa tames the spirit and rides it through the ocean to reach a mysterious island.</p>

      <p>There, Elsa is able to connect with the world of magic, and fully embraces her powers. However, in the process she confronts the crimes of her family's past. Her powers allow the water to share their memories with Elsa, revealing that her grandfather built a massive dam specifically to contain magical powers. He then secretly killed the chief of the northerners during a peace meeting. That breaks Elsa's spirit, and she's overcome with the cold, and freezes in place. But the memory is carried off on the wind, thanks potentially to Gale, the air elemental.</p>

      <h3>MAKING THINGS RIGHT</h3>

      <p>The last message is able to reach Anna, who learns the truth of what her family did. Realizing the dam constructed by their grandfather is what's holding back magic, Anna has to figure out what to do bring down the dam. She attracts the attention of the enraged Earth Giants, and leads them on a chase through the woods. Although she's nearly killed in the act -- she's saved from being crushed by the timely arrival of Kristoff and Sven -- she's able to draw them to the dam.</p>
      <p>Working with the Arendelle soldiers, Anna is able to get the giants to throw massive boulders at the dam by running across it herself. She survives, and the dam is destroyed. Magic is able to be freed, but the ensuing flood threatens to destroy Arendelle. Luckily, this surge of energy is enough to unleash Elsa, who quickly rides Nokk the water elemental and races home. She arrives just in time to freeze the wave, and save the kingdom.</p>

      <h3>THE NEW QUEEN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Frozen-2-feature.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>After the kingdom is saved, peace can return to the land. Magic doesn't lash out at humanity, and a level of coexistence is achieved. Part of that is caused by Elsa leaving the throne and joining the wilds, living alongside the native northerners and the other elemental spirits. In her stead, Anna (and her new fiance, Kristoff) will rule Arendelle. It signifies a major change in the power structure of this fantasy world.</p>
      <p>It also means there's now a definite alliance between the forces of the wilds and the people of Arendelle. Having both worlds watched over by sisters who very much love each other should make for a powerful force in the world. Of course, if a conflict were to rise up between the two again, it might force the sisters to face off with one another. Hopefully, the power of family is enough to keep them from falling to any of that kind of in-fighting, but it's something that can be explored if Disney decides to give audiences a <i>Frozen</i><i> 3</i>.</p>
