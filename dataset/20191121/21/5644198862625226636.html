      <p>U.S. stock index futures were slightly lower on Thursday, as mixed signals on trade and a row between Washington and Beijing over the Hong Kong protests fanned concerns about the timing of a deal to end their prolonged tariff dispute.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: U.S. stock index futures moved sharply higher on Thursday after South China Morning Post reported that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports due Dec. 15 could be delayed even if a trade deal was not signed by then.</p>
