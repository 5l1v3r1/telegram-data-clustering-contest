      <h1>New Proposed Anti-Abortion Bill In Ohio Asks Doctors To Do Something That Is Not Medically Possible</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:55:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author">Alfredo Carpineti</a></address>
      <p>After passing the so-called heartbeat law in April, Ohio is now proposing another bill in its latest attempt to curtail abortion rights and bodily autonomy in the American state. On top of that, the bill tasks doctors to do something that is not medically feasible.</p>
      <p>Ohio’s HB413 would completely outlaw abortion in the state. It would define a fertilized egg as a person, and doctors performing this medical procedure could be found guilty of abortion murder. This would be a first-degree offense carrying a penalty of imprisonment for life. The part of the bill that goes into the realm of science fiction is in Sec. 2904.35 part C.</p>
      <p>“Takes all possible steps to preserve the life of the unborn child, while preserving the life of the woman. Such steps include, if applicable, attempting to re-implant an ectopic pregnancy into the woman's uterus,” reads <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-documents?id=GA133-HB-413">the bill</a>. </p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/">ectopic pregnancy</a> happens when an egg is fertilized outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tube – the connection between the ovaries and the uterus. The embryo begins developing in the tube and can rupture it, leading to internal bleeding. Ectopic pregnancies are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs00404-014-3266-9">the most common cause of death</a> during the first trimester.</p>
      <p>When such a pregnancy is discovered, the only solution is to operate and remove the embryo before the life of the expectant parent is beyond saving. Once the embryo is removed, it cannot be implanted back. There is no technological or medical know-how that would allow even the most skilled doctor to perform such a medical feat.</p>
      <p>"The time has come to abolish abortion in its entirety," said Butler County Rep. Candice Keller, who is co-sponsoring the abortion ban.</p>
      <p>Kellie Copeland, NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio Executive Director, disagrees in a <a href="https://prochoiceohio.org/2019/11/14/new-abortion-ban-bill-ohio/">statement</a>: “These politicians want a total ban on abortion, to classify any abortion as murder. They want prosecutors to charge people who provide or receive abortion care with aggravated murder, which carries the death penalty. They would also remove protections for pregnant people who experience issues during pregnancy, and place individuals experiencing a miscarriage at risk of criminal prosecution."</p>
      <p>The bill may also impact the prescription of contraception, such as birth control and fertility treatment.</p>
