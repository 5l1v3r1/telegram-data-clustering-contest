      <h1>Halle Berry injured during fight scene on MMA movie ‘Bruised’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:45:22+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:45</time> by <a rel="author">Carolyn Lee Adams</a></address>
      <p>Halle Berry was<a href="https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2019/11/halle-berry-injured-while-filming-mma-movie-bruised-in-nj-newark-filming-rescheduled.html"> injured on the set of <i>Bruised</i>,</a> the MMA movie in which she plays Jackie “Justice”, a disgraced MMA fighter looking for redemption. <i>Bruised </i>is also the Academy Award winner’s directorial debut. Berry joins a small and elite group of actors who have gone behind the camera even as they continue to perform in front of it.</p>
      <p>Berry’s involvement with <i>Bruised</i> really began with her role in <i>John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum</i>, where she performed many of her own stunts. <i>Bruised </i>is produced by Thunder Road Films, the company that created <i>John Wick</i>, allowing Berry to continue on with the same team of stunt coordinators. In addition, she spent eight months training with MMA fighters. On November 9th, she proudly posted a picture of her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4nTHQJjiZo/">six pack on Instagram</a>, writing, “One of my goals for #BruisedTheMovie? Ripped Abs - and today? I finally got them and it feels unbelievable!”</p>
      <p>Shooting was delayed to accommodate Berry’s injury. Filming is currently in Newark, at Mack’s Elite Heat Boxing Gym. <a href="http://NJ.com/">NJ.com</a> broke the story, interviewing executive producer Brian Pitt. Pitt said, “Halle got slightly injured in the fight. She’s tired. She needed a break.”</p>
      <p>Berry responded on Instagram with a clarification. “It’s par for the course when you do your own stunts, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Just know I’m far from tired. I’m wide awake...and just getting started!”</p>

      <p>Originally, screenwriter Michelle Rosenfarb wrote the protagonist as a 21-year-old, but upon meeting Berry, the character of <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/9/24/20875019/evolution-halle-berry-ufc-fight-film-bruised-interview-writer-michelle-rosenfarb-thunder-road">Jackie evolved dramatically</a>. Rosenfarb and Berry have done a great deal of character research to make <i>Bruised </i>as realistic as possible, interviewing female MMA fighters and spending time at UFC headquarters in Las Vegas. Clearly, Berry is dedicated to giving the role her all.</p>
