      <h1>Nikki Haley described as 'front-runner' for 2024 GOP nomination</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:21:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Yilek</a></address>
      <p>Nikki Haley, former United Nations ambassador, has been mum about her political future, but she was recently described as the “the early front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination” by Texas Republicans.</p>
      <p>The Dallas County Republican Party sent an invitation Thursday inviting supporters to a fundraiser that Haley will headline on Dec. 2, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/21/nikki-haley-frontrunner-2024-gop-nomination-072602">according to <i>Politico</i></a>. The invite billed the event as “Road to 2024” and credits the former Trump administration official’s <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nikki-haley-was-deeply-disturbed-by-trumps-dangerous-comments-on-charlottesville">new book, <i>With All Due Respect</i>,</a> with stirring speculation that she could run for president.</p>
      <p>Event attendees are being asked to donate up to $25,000.</p>
      <p>Rodney Anderson, Dallas County Republican Party chairman, said Haley’s team had not approved the language in the invite, and he had apologized for it. He said his staff was working to update the description.</p>
      <p>"It's completely my fault," he said. “She’s glad to come help us raise money … but [2024 is] not what this is about.”</p>
      <p>Since she stepped down from her position, it’s been speculated that she could replace Vice President Mike Pence on the 2020 ticket. She has denied the rumors, and President Trump has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-he-wont-replace-pence-with-nikki-haley">insisted he is sticking with Pence as his running mate</a>.</p>
      <p>Haley, 47, addressed her political future during a stop on her book tour last week.</p>
      <p>“It would be a waste of time to think about 2024 at this point,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/nikki-haley-keeps-door-open-for-2024-presidential-run/">she said</a>. “Instead, I want to do everything I do really well now and just see if doors open.”</p>
