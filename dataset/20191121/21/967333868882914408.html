      <p>Kim Woo-bin made his official return on stage on 21 November during the 40th Blue Dragon Film Awards in Incheon.</p>
      <p>He has thus appeared in public for the first time since May 2017, when he was in the midst of shooting the film “Wiretap” by director Choi Dong-hoon and his <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201804011063115250-korea-pop-band-diplomacy/">fans in Korea and abroad</a> were shocked by news that he had been diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer. During this whole time, his girlfriend Shin Min-a, who is also a famous actress, supported him amid his drug and radiation treatment.</p>
      <p>Luckily, the diagnosis was determined in time, so the actor stopped all his activities and started a serious treatment course.</p>
      <p>Fans are full of joy that their favourite actor is back and hope that the disease won't be back.</p>
