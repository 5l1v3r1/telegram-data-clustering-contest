      <h1>Updated Betting Line Released For Ohio State-Michigan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:19:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes are solely focusing on eighth-ranked Penn State this upcoming Saturday. But that hasn’t stopped Vegas from looking ahead to the Buckeyes’ big-time rivalry game against No. 13 Michigan on Nov. 30.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is among the top four of the latest edition of the College Football Playoff rankings. The Wolverines would love nothing more than to spoil the Buckeyes’ playoff hopes.</p>
      <p>Michigan has steadily improved over the course of the season en route to an 8-2 record through 10 games. The Wolverines may be improving, but Vegas’ oddsmakers think Ohio State will win by at least two scores.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Buckeyes are currently 13-point favorites according to the <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Vegas-oddsmaker-releases-spread-on-Michigan-Ohio-State-138957950/">latest spread</a>. That’s a rather comfortable margin for most teams. But 13 points is a bit closer than most are expecting. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Michigan’s home field crowd will be huge factor. And as happens in most rivalry games, tensions will be higher than normal. Will Jim Harbaugh’s squad give Ryan Day and the Buckeyes a scare in the regular season finale?</p>
      <p>One thing’s for sure – the Wolverines must contain OSU QB Justin Fields. The dual-threat quarterback is as dangerous as they come. If Michigan is going to have any shot at an upset, they must slow him down.</p>
      <p>Michigan and Ohio State play a week from Saturday on Nov. 30 in Ann Arbor.</p>
