      <p>NEW YORK — U.S. Treasury yields rose on Thursday after falling for three straight sessions, bolstered by more positive news on U.S.- China trade negotiations and the unwinding of most of this week’s safe-haven demand.</p>
      <p>The Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday Beijing will strive to reach an initial bilateral trade agreement as both sides keep communication channels open.</p>
      <p>Gao Feng, spokesman at the ministry, told reporters China will try hard to reach a “phase one” deal.</p>
      <p>“The Chinese comment … is, I guess, less negative than the headlines that hit yesterday,” said Ellis Phifer, market strategist, at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
      <p>“You got a lot of machines moving, a lot of algos moving – I guess that had a lot to do with yesterday’s moves. So today’s headlines have given a near-term calming effect to the market,” he added.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s remarks from China came after a series of headlines earlier this week that suggested ongoing trade talks were unraveling, prompting a safe-haven rally in U.S. Treasuries.</p>
      <p>Some market participants said the steep rise in Treasury prices on Wednesday that pushed U.S. long-term yields to three-week lows were driven by so-called algorithmic or systematic traders.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported on Wednesday that negotiations to finalize a deal may extend into next year as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks.</p>
      <p>That news came after the U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed legislation aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong, provoking a strong reaction from China.</p>
      <p>Overall, Raymond James’ Phifer believes a “phase one” deal will eventually get done. “I think it helps both economies if they get some of the uncertainty out of the way.”</p>
      <p>But said he did not think a big trade deal was coming.</p>
      <p>“I think the U.S. and China would continue talking after a preliminary deal. And we will have the same ups and downs like what we’re getting right now,” Phifer said.</p>
      <p>With bond investors focused on trade, Thursday’s mixed economic data had little impact on the Treasury market.</p>
      <p>Initial U.S. weekly jobless claims were unexpectedly unchanged at a five-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labor market.</p>
      <p>Other reports though showed a mild pick up in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region this month, but manufacturers reported a sharp slowdown in new orders, shipments and unfilled orders.</p>
      <p>In afternoon trading, U.S. 10-year note yields rose to 1.774%, up from Wednesday’s 1.738%.</p>
      <p>Yields on 30-year bonds were up at 2.235%, up from 2.203% on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>On the short-end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields edged up to 1.606%, from Wednesday’s 1.572%.</p>
      <p>The yield curve steepened on Thursday on more upbeat trade news, reversing six straight sessions of flattening. The spread between the two-year and 10-year note yields widened to as much as 16.90 basis points. (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss Editing by Nick Zieminski and Richard Chang)</p>
