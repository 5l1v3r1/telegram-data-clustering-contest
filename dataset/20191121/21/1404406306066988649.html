      <p>The NBA is back with its new city edition uniforms for the 2019-20 season. One of the uniforms that stood out was the Brooklyn Nets' homage to Christopher Wallace. Last season the Nets gave Biggie the nod with the Coogi-trimmed unis but this season they're really looking to rep The Notorious B.I.G. with the updated jersey featuring Biggie's neighborhood of Bed-Stuy across the chest. </p>
      <p>Longtime sportswriter and NBA insider Marc J. Spears tweeted:</p>
      <p>"And winner of the #NBA city jersey competition: Broooooooklyn. Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood is the borough of The Notorious B.I.G. With “BED-STUY” on chest, the Nets’ 2019-20 Nike City Edition uniform represents the neighborhood’s history, music, art, &amp; culture."</p>
