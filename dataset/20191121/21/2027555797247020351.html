      <h1>16 found sealed in trailer on ferry bound for Ireland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:09:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Sixteen people have been found sealed inside a trailer on a ferry bound for the Irish port of Rosslare, shipping operator Stena Line said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The discovery draws renewed attention to the issue of illegal immigration and human trafficking in western Europe, after 39 Vietnamese were found dead in a trailer in Britain last month.</p>
      <p>And on Tuesday, the crew of a cargo ferry run by DFDS Seaways found 25 migrants in a refrigerated container on a boat sailing to Britain and forced the vessel to return to port.</p>
      <p>The 16 individuals in the latest discovery were found aboard a Wednesday night sailing of the Stena Horizon ship from Cherbourg in northern France.</p>
      <p>"One of our employees during a routine inspection discovered 16 people in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck," Stena Line chief communications officer Ian Hampton said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"All the individuals are reported to be in good health and have been moved to a private passenger lounge on the ship."</p>
      <p>The ship was due to arrive in port mid-afternoon Thursday, according to the firm, and immigration and security officials have been alerted to meet them.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from Irish police or indications of the people's nationalities.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in Dublin, a man being held for alleged participation in the British case involving the 39 Vietnamese victims appeared in court for an extradition hearing.</p>
      <p>Eamon Harrison is alleged to have delivered the trailer in which the 39 victims were found dead to Zeebrugge in Belgium before it travelled on to a port in southeast England.</p>
      <p>He faces 39 charges of manslaughter, one count of conspiracy to commit human trafficking and one count of conspiracy to assist in unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>The case was adjourned until another hearing on December 12.</p>
