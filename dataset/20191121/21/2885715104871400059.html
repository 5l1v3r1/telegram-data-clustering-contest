      <h1>PIL on AIIMS ‘favouritism’: Delhi HC seeks Centre, hospital reply</h1>
      <h2>Former Director of AIIMS Dr P Venugopal, who moved the court, sought directions to the Union Public Service Commission and other authorities to determine the order of merit while directly recruiting medical faculty to the institution.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:41:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>The Delhi High Court has sought to know the stand of the Centre and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on a PIL alleging favouritism in the recruitment to faculty posts at the premier institution. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar asked the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and AIIMS to file replies by February.</p>
      <p>Former Director of AIIMS Dr P Venugopal, who moved the court, sought directions to the Union Public Service Commission and other authorities to determine the order of merit while directly recruiting medical faculty to the institution.</p>
      <p>In the plea, Venugopal (77) said he filed it in public interest on the basis of his personal knowledge, which he has derived from his experience at AIIMS, and other material available in public.</p>
      <p>The petition alleged that less meritorious candidates are being given preference in exchange for a consideration, thereby lowering the standard of the institution and compromising larger public interest. It also alleged that this is affecting the ability and morale of faculty members to perform their functions to their fullest capability.</p>
      <p>The plea said the issue raised is of such a nature that it involves greater public interest and being a pioneer and premier institution, the reputation of AIIMS is at stake due to inaction on the part of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare — the parent ministry.</p>
      <p>The plea claimed that during Venugopal’s interaction with various faculty members at AIIMS in the last four months, “almost on a daily basis, the petitioner has come across stories of undue favours being given to non-meritorious persons, bypassing of rules and granting favours in exchange of quid pro quo, and general apathy and alienation of meritorious candidates who are not even getting the seniority deserved by them under the mandate of the statute”.</p>
      <p>“Having regard to Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, nepotism or favouritism can never be permitted in any process for selection of medical faculty at an institute of national importance such as AIIMS, where providing of services has a direct consequence on the lives of hundred and thousands of patients who throng the institute every day,” the plea said.</p>
      <p>The petition also raised eight questions for the court’s adjudication, including, “whether recruitment to faculty posts at AIIMS can be permitted to be controlled by political and other considerations, thereby leading to dilution of merit at an institution of national importance which plays a vital role in maintaining public standards of the country”.</p>
      <p>It added, “Whether it is permissible to adopt a non-transparent methodology or one which does not recognise merit as the only criterion for recruitment to such vital posts occupied by faculty members at AIIMS, where such faculty members are directly engaged in patient care, research, education and training the future generation of doctors.”</p>
