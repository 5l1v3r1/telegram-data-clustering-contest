      <p>Shocking footage shows a plane's engine apparently spewing flames over <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel">Los Angeles International Airport</a>.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the plane was able to circle back and land safely at the airport.</p>
      <p>It has not been confirmed what sparked the flames.</p>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/toriatkins/status/1197606930610438144">Multiple</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewblakeames/status/1197608888188559360">videos</a> of the incident were uploaded to social media, although they apparently misidentified the flight. One video claimed it was a Delta flight, while a user tagged American Airlines in another post.</p>
