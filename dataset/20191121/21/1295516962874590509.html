      <p>With the Arrowverse's heroes <a href="https://www.cbr.com/supergirl-crisis-on-infinite-earths-synopsis/">slated to be assembled</a> in part one of The CW's upcoming "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis On Infinite Earths</a>" event, the second chapter, airing during <i>Batwoman</i>, promises to reintroduce one of its villains.</p>
      <p>According to The CW's official synopsis, Lex Luthor, who was recently seen on <i>Supergirl</i>, returns on the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths-superman-clark-kent-photos/">Superman-centric episode</a>. The episode will feature Tyler Hoechlin, who already plays the Man of Steel on the show. Brandon Routh will also appear as Kingdom Come's version of Superman, and <i>Smallville's</i> Tom Welling will at least appear as alter ego Clark Kent. So Lex will have plenty of versions of his arch-foe to deal with.</p>
