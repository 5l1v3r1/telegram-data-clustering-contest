      <p>The conversation still on families, Kate said they were all a range of ages, with Caitlyn being 70 years old, Jacqueline being a Mum at 22 years old and added she was a Mum at 38 which is officially geriatric. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-jacqueline-jossa-breaks-17296762">Jacqueline said</a> 38 is not geriatric.  Kate said “It is medically.”</p>
      <p>Kate said: “When you are younger, you might feel like you know what you’re doing but actually you feel like that when you’re older.  Do you remember holding that little bundle and feeling the pressure that you’re entirely responsible.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn said: “Does anyone remember the first time something came out of your mouth that you’re Mother said to you?” everyone laughed. </p>
      <p>Caitlyn continued: “It’s so scary when you become your parents.”</p>
