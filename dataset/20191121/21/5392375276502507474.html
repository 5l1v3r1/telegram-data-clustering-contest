      <p>Huawei could be in a worse situation if it hasn’t its own chipsets. For that reason, it’s easy to understand why some Chinese firms are starting to look for alternatives. Now, it seems that <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Oppo">Oppo</a> is one of the companies that is greatly interested in releasing a new chipset of its own. The company has been very successful thanks to Realme smartphones and the Reno lineup. Therefore, we can understand why it is looking for a way to reduce its reliance on third-party technologies.</p>

      <p>According to a trademark filed in <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/oppo-m1-smartphone-processor/">EUIPO (European Union Intellectual Property Office)</a>, Oppo’s chip bears the Oppo M1 moniker. Furthermore, sources that are familiar with the matter informed that Oppo is working with engineers from MediaTek and Qualcomm. They will help in the development of this M1 chip. Unfortunately, that’s everything we know about Oppo M1 chipset. However, the fact that the Chinese firm has registered a trademark for it seems solid enough.</p>
      <p>If Oppo is indeed developing a new chipset for smartphones, then the next year’s MWC could be a good opportunity to showcase the technology. Moreover, we are curious to know if the Oppo M1 will come for the midrange segment or if it will be a Flagship chipset. Worth noting that any new chipset that is in development for Oppo smartphones, may also benefit Vivo and OnePlus devices. After all, these three companies are part of the same BBK conglomerate.</p>
