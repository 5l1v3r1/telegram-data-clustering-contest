      <h1>Explosive argument rips I'm A Celeb camp apart as campmates row</h1>
      <h2>Tensions were at an all time high during tonight's episode</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:41:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>The I'm A Celebrity camp was rocked tonight, as an explosive argument split the campmates in half.</p>
      <p>James and Kate brought a Jungle scroll into camp that had new campmates Andy and Cliff’s faces on as Outlaws.</p>
      <p>Kate read the scroll out to camp: “Outlaws caught wanted for their crime of late entry.  The two new campmates Andy and Cliff have been sent to Jungle Jailhouse on basic rations. </p>
      <p>"Before entering the Jailhouse they took part in today’s Bushtucker Trial – The Frontier of Fear and they won 8 stars for camp.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/how-much-im-celebrity-stars-17295898">The camp</a> cheered.</p>
      <p>Kate continued: “So you now have the opportunity to be good, bad or downright ugly.  So we can keep all the food ourselves, or we can choose to feed the outlaws with our share of food, however if we choose to feed them we will have to send two campmates to join them as outlaws in the Jailhouse.”</p>

      <p>Andrew and James both said they were happy to go, Kate and Ian also said they were happy to go.  Ian suggested they draw straws.</p>
      <p>Talking in the BT, Roman said “We decided to draw named water bottles over who would go.”</p>
      <p>And that's when the drama started <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-jacqueline-jossa-breaks-17296762">as Jacqueline said</a> “I think that’s scary.”  <i>(Referring to drawing names)</i> .</p>
      <p>Kate asked if she’d rather not go and Ian said she didn’t have to go.  Jacqueline said “Yeah but it’s not very heroic.”</p>

      <p>Andrew jumped in and said: “I think it has to be everyone in, I don’t think it’s fair to count yourself out.”</p>
      <p>James said “If she doesn’t want to do it, don’t do it.”</p>
      <p>Andrew hit back and said “It’s an ordeal that has to be shared.”</p>

      <p>Andrew turned to Jacqueline and said: “It’s not back to Snake Rock, it could be anything.”</p>
      <p>Adele jumped in and said: “I think it’s just anybody that’s up for it.  If anyone wants to stay they should be allowed.”  </p>
      <p>Tensions began to rise and Jacqueline and Nadine both said they didn’t want to take part and would prefer to remain in Main Camp.</p>

      <p>Talking in the BT, Andrew said: “Jacqueline and Nadine said they didn’t want to go and erm…that’s the end of that…”</p>
      <p>Andrew didn’t understand why Nadine and Jacqueline wouldn’t put themselves up like everyone else.</p>
      <p>The campmates picked out named water bottles out of a bag and the last two remaining were the two to go to the Jailhouse – they were Kate and Andrew.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline said James didn’t mind going if Kate wanted to stay, more tension followed until the campmates all agreed to continue as discussed and Kate and Andrew would go.</p>
      <p>Kate and Andrew left camp to join Andy and Cliff at the Jungle Jailhouse.</p>
