          </p>
          <p>Although it’s still just the early exchanges of the Super League of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2019-20, today’s contest between Baroda and Delhi comes bearing with it gargantuan ramifications for both the sides. After registering wins in their round openers yesterday, both the sides know another win for them today will massively bolster their chances of making it to proceeding round of the marquee tournamnet.</p>
          <p>Currently on top of Group A of the Super League stage after trouncing Maharashtra yesterday, Delhi come into today’s encounter with immense momentum in their kitty. It was not the just the win but the manner it came about and the identity of the side it came against which saw Delhi earn immense laurels as they ended up winning by 77 runs,</p>

                <p>Batting first to score 167, Delhi returned with an even better bowling display as they curtailed their opponents to a mere 90 runs. Elsewhere, Baroda also tasted consummate success in yesterday’s clash to come into the docket of today’s clash having thumped Rajasthan by 15 runs on the same wicket as the one which will be laid out today.</p>
                <p>The 202run target they had dished out infront of Rajasthan was one which was never going to be peeled off by Rajasthan and despite cameos from their lower middle-order, Baroda kept snagging wickets at regular intervals to ease through to a win. With both the sides having doled out such resplendent displays yesterday, this is a clash which is an intoxicating brew, a match which will grip us from the first to the last ball.</p>

                            <h3>BRD Vs DEL Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>One of his side’s leading scorer, Kedar Devdhar came up with yet another stellar knock yesterday for his side to see his stature as a player grow for the outfit immensely. The side’s captain, wicket-keeper and opener will step out to the middle looking to resonate the same rampant performance to make him our first choice for this one.</p>
                            <p>From Delhi elsewhere we are opting for Anuj Rawat. Over the course of the last two months, the player has emerged as a focal point of his side’s batting unit with flawless and dependable displays, ones which have seen him make massive strides in India’s domestic circuit.</p>
                            <h3>BRD Vs DEL Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>With 222 runs in 5 matches for his side, Aditya Waghmode was always going to be a regulation pick for us given the expansive strokeplay at his disposal which has seen him amass immense runs. From Delhi elsewhere we are opting for Dhruv Shorey and Himmat Singh, two players whose roles will grow immensely against a batting unit which is capable of chasing down the biggest of targets.</p>
                            <p>
                              <b><b>BRD Vs DEL Dream11 </b>All-Rounders</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>The two players come in from Baroda for us over here as we compensate for the batting choices form the side. In Deepak Hooda, we have someone who is not only capable of playing an integral role with the bat but is more than capable of contributing vitally with the ball as well to make the all-rounder our first choice in this slot.</p>
                            <p>He will find company in Swapnil Singh whilst from Delhi, spinner Lalit Yadav becomes our singular choice with the rank turner always willing to give rotations, air and guile on his deliveries to ask the batsmen to come out and end up holing him.</p>
                            <h3>BRD Vs DEL Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>The 8 wickets in 7 matches for Delhi’s Simarjeet Singh see him become our first pick for this encounter while Baroda will have a duo representing the. We begin with their top wicket taker Lukman Meriwala with Rishi Arothe partnering him up, two frontline, spearhead bowlers who’ll be doling out their overs in both the powerplay period and the death overs.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Anuj has been selected as our outfit’s captain for the day while Aditya is being made our vice-captain.</p>
