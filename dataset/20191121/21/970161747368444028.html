      <p>Rachel Riley is facing calls to be sacked from Countdown as the backlash to her Jeremy Corbyn T-shirt rolls on.</p>
      <p>The presenter, who is pregnant with her first child, wore a T-shirt with an old photo of the Labour party leader on it that had been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-sparks-backlash-erasing-jeremy-corbyns-anti-apartheid-message-photoshopped-t-shirt-11192944/">Photoshopped to read ‘Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour’.</a></p>
      <p>The historic image from 1984 was of Corbyn protesting apartheid in South Africa, and he held a sign that said ‘Defend the right to demonstrate against apartheid; join this picket.’</p>
      <p>There have been calls for Rachel – who has been vocal in her opposition to Labour due to allegations of anti-Semitism in the party – to be sacked from Channel 4 due to her t-shirt, with many accusing her of erasing the anti-apartheid message.</p>
      <p>The hashtag #sackRachelRiley began trending on Twitter on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>One user posted: ‘My grandfather was a survivor of the holocaust. My family have learned from history to fight against all forms of racism. Rachel Riley is disgraceful for attacking Corbyn – a principled anti-racist – in the way she has.’</p>

      <p>So, @Channel4, how long are you going to let your employee get away with this sort of thing? Countdown is becoming unwatchable for A LOT of people now #SackRachelRiley.’</p>
      <p>The TV star, who is married to Strictly Come Dancing professional Pascha Kovalev, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-claims-highlighting-jeremy-corbyns-history-racism-photoshopped-t-shirt-11194388/">did not back down</a> in the face of the backlash.</p>

      <p>The star tweeted: ‘The ease at which large swathes of people can be mobilised into group hate, for highlighting Corbyn’s history of racism using an image of his arrest as part of an extreme group cited as damaging the mainstream anti-apartheid movement, is just one reason Jewish people are worried.</p>

      <p>‘Trying to brand me as racist for this, whist lauding themselves as anti-racist heroes, shows just how little regard many people have for anti-Jewish racism, and why I and many others speak so loudly. It’s a hatred which unites the far right, far left and is having a resurgence.’</p>
      <p>Rachel continued: ‘I won’t dignify this with any further response &amp; I won’t tolerate abuse from those who choose to rank one form of racism over another, that’s hypocrisy. They’re all unacceptable. End of.’</p>
