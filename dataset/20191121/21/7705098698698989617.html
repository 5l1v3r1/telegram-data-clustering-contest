      <h1>DC Universe’s Stargirl TV Series Will Also Air on The CW</h1>

      <p>With the immanent arrival of HBO Max, the future of the DC Universe streaming service is unclear. DC Universe and HBO Max will be sharing custody of the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/doom-patrol"><b>Doom Patrol</b></a> live-action series. Now, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/stargirl-episodes-the-cw-network-dc-universe-streaming-debut-linear-window-digital-1202792227/">Deadline</a> is reporting that The CW and DC Universe will share <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/stargirl"><b>Stargirl</b></a> as well.</p>
      <p>While an official announcement has yet to be made, the tentative plans call for <b>Stargirl</b> episodes to premiere on DC Universe. However, those episodes would only be exclusive to DC Universe for a single day. The CW will supposedly air them the following day, and then stream episodes online and via The CW app.</p>
      <p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dc-universes-stargirl-air-on-the-cw-debut-during-crisis-2019-11">Business Insider</a> states that Brec Bassinger may make her debut as Stargirl during the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths"><b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b></a> crossover. But that is currently unconfirmed.</p>

      <p>Bassinger will headline the <b>Stargirl</b> series as Courtney Whitmore, a teenager who reinvents herself as a superheroine after discovering her step-father’s heroic heritage.  Luke Wilson co-stars as Courtney’s step-father, Pat Dugan, with Joel McHale, Lou Ferrigno, Jr., Brian Stapf, and Henry Thomas also recurring as members of the Justice Society.</p>
      <p><b>Stargirl</b> will premiere on DC Universe and The CW in 2020.</p>
