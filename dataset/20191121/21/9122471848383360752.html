      <h1>Legendary NFL Kicker Has Passed Away At 80</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:57:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>A legendary NFL player passed away earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Fred Cox, the franchise leader in points for the Minnesota Vikings, passed away on Wednesday night in  Minnesota, the team said in a statement. He was 80 years old.</p>
      <p>Cox played 15 seasons for the Vikings – the third-longest tenure in franchise history.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.vikings.com/news/vikings-mourn-passing-of-legendary-kicker-nerf-football-inventor-fred-cox">Vikings released a statement</a> about Cox’s passing.</p>
      <blockquote>The Vikings mourn the loss of Fred Cox, one of our proudest legends and a member of the 50 Greatest Vikings. A respected teammate and friend, Fred’s football career as the Vikings all-time leading scorer set the stage for a life where he went on to achieve great things in business and in his community. Fred’s positive energy, strength in his faith and passion for life will be missed.</blockquote>
      <p>Off the field, Cox teamed with John Mattox to invent the NERF football. Hall of Fame quarterback and former Vikings teammate Fran Tarkenton raved about Cox.</p>
      <p>“He had a great brain and was a great thinker,” Tarkenton said. “Fred was a great businessman and invented the Nerf football. He was an intellect that I spent every morning with before we played a game. I spent more time with him than any other player. Fred was a special, special human being who will be missed.”</p>
      <p>Our thoughts are with the Cox family and Vikings organization.</p>
