      <h1>REPORT: NFL Spokesperson Says League ‘Found No Evidence’ of Racial Slur By Mason Rudolph</h1>

      <p>On Thursday, Browns defensive end Myles Garrett was said to have told NFL officials during his appeal that Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph used a racial slur towards him that caused him to take his helmet off and hit him with it.</p>
      <p>Hours later, he got a huge shot to that story when ESPN’s Adam Schefter stated an NFL spokesperson relayed to him that the league had found nothing to corroborate that allegation.</p>

      <p>Maybe the league should release audio of the game to further prove their point and end anymore speculation of what was said and what wasn’t said.</p>
