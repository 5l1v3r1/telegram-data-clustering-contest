      <p>Former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill has told the House Intelligence Committee during an open hearing as part of the Donald Trump impeachment inquiry that the idea that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is a "fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services."</p>
      <p>"Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country â€” and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did," she said, according to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-21-19/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>"This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves," Hill stressed.</p>
      <p>"The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports. It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlined details must remain classified."</p>
