      <p>The Spanish champions have collected 25 points from their 12 league matches this season to top the pile, although they are level on points with second-placed Real Madrid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ernesto-valverde/"><b>Ernesto Valverde</b></a>'s side <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/result/result-lionel-messi-hat-trick-puts-barcelona-back-on-top_378516.html">thumped Celta Vigo 4-1</a> in their last game before the international break and will fancy their chances of overcoming a Leganes side that are bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how the Catalan giants could line up this weekend.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nelson-semedo/"><b>Nelson Semedo</b></a> (calf), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jordi-alba/"><b>Jordi Alba</b></a> (hamstring), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sergi-roberto/"><b>Sergi Roberto</b></a> (suspension)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ivan-rakitic/"><b>Ivan Rakitic</b></a> (Achilles)</p>
      <p>Valverde has a problem at right-back ahead of the match with Nelson Semedo out with a calf problem and Sergi Roberto unavailable due to a one-match suspension.</p>
      <p>As a result, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/moussa-wague/"><b>Moussa Wague</b></a> is being tipped to make his fourth appearance for the club, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/junior-firpo/"><b>Junior Firpo</b></a> is likely to feature on the opposite side as Jordi Alba is out with a hamstring complaint.</p>
      <p>Ivan Rakitic is the only other injury doubt due to an Achilles issue, although the Croatia international is unlikely to start either way with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/arthur/"><b>Arthur</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sergio-busquets/"><b>Sergio Busquets</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frenkie-de-jong/"><b>Frenkie de Jong</b></a> developing into the first-choice midfield.</p>
      <p>Valverde has decisions to make further forward, though, when it comes to which two players join Lionel Messi in attack.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ansu-fati/"><b>Ansu Fati</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antoine-griezmann/"><b>Antoine Griezmann</b></a> both started against Celta before the international break, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/luis-suarez/"><b>Luis Suarez</b></a> is expected to return to the XI for this game, meaning that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ousmane-dembele/"><b>Ousmane Dembele</b></a> could be left out once again.</p>
