      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> is considering a shock move for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/zlatan-ibrahimovic/">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> following the striker’s exit from LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>The Swede is available on a free transfer after being released by the Galaxy following two seasons on the west coast.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic has played under Mourinho on two occasions and the Portuguese convinced the striker to join Manchester United on a free in 2016.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old is believed to be in talks with former club AC Milan over a return to Europe but Mourinho’s appointment in north London could prove pivotal.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/tottenham-linked-veteran-forward-zlatan-ibrahimovic-following/">Telegraph</a>, Mourinho wants back-up for Harry Kane and is considering hijacking Milan’s move for Ibrahimovic.</p>
      <p>The Swede could be open to a return as he feels he has unfinished business in England following the manner of his departure in 2018.</p>

      <p>Ibrahimovic scored 26 goals in his first season at United but he tore his ACL towards the end of a glittering debut campaign and was unable to recapture his form upon his return.</p>
      <p>But the veteran was back to his best in MLS and could provide short-term relief to Mourinho’s money problems at Spurs.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese boss has been told he doesn’t have money to spend in January and must sell before he can buy.</p>
