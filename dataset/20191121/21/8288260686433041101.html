      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> has also been touted as a possible signing in January, with the forward ranks clearly a position that need bolstering at Villa.</p>
      <p>However according to The Athletic, Villa won't be spending big in the New Year with the club not expecting a busy window.</p>
      <p>And that has got Villa fans worried about how that might impact their season.</p>
