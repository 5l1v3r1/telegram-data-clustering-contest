      <h1>Kelly Clarkson Addresses Controversy Over “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” Lyrics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:56:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:56</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/john-legend">John Legend</a>’s deluxe version of his Christmas album, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/John-legend/A-legendary-christmas-deluxe"><i>A Legendary Christmas</i></a>, features an updated version of <a href="https://genius.com/John-legend-baby-its-cold-outside-lyrics">“Baby, It’s Cold Outside”</a> with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/kelly-clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a>. However, notable figures like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/sharon-osbourne">Sharon Osbourne</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/dean-martin">Dean Martin</a>’s daughter weren’t pleased with the lyrical overhaul. So, the <a href="https://genius.com/Kelly-clarkson-piece-by-piece-lyrics">“Piece by Piece”</a> singer addressed the backlash on her own show, <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i>.</p>
      <p>She spoke about how the new version came about. “[Legend] had this idea—because of the #MeToo movement, they pulled ‘Baby, It’s Cold Outside’ from… a lot of radio stations,” Clarkson said. “I love that song… Both John and I have cut the original, we like the original, but we noticed that a lot of people didn’t, so we were like, ‘Let’s just give ‘em another option,’ and apparently we killed Christmas!”</p>
      <p>Legend’s wife Chrissy Teigen made a guest appearance on the program. “If I can’t have my creepy song, it’s not Christmas,” she joked.</p>
      <p>The original version raised eyebrows in the wake of the #MeToo movement. At one point, the lyrics imply a drink was spiked:</p>
      <blockquote>Say what’s in this drink (No cabs to be had out there)<br/>I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)<br/>To break this spell (I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell)<br/>I ought to say “No, no, no sir” (Mind if I move in closer?)<br/>At least I’m gonna say that I tried (What’s the sense in hurtin' my pride?)</blockquote>
      <p>Last year, Cleveland radio station Star 102 removed the original version from the air. Radio host Glenn Anderson <a href="https://star102cleveland.radio.com/blogs/glenn-anderson/star-102-abruptly-stops-playing-christmas-song-heres-why">wrote a blog post</a> about how “the song has no place” in a post-#MeToo world.</p>
      <p><i>Insecure</i>’s Natasha Rothwell contributed to the newer version’s lyrics, which place more emphasis on consent:</p>
      <blockquote>So, really, I’d better scurry (Your driver, his name is Murray)<br/>But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh, we’re both adults, so who’s keepin' score)<br/>What will my friends think? (It’s your body and your choice)<br/>If I have one more drink? (It’s your body and your choice)</blockquote>
      <p>However, the Rat Pack member’s daughter, Deana Martin, voiced her dissatisfaction with the new cut on <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmG-Oyi7WRg">Good Morning Britain</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>You do not change the lyrics to the song. He’s made it more sexual with those words that he has just said. It’s absolutely absurd. I think what he’s done is, he’s stealing the thunder from Frank Loesser’s song and from my dad. He should write his own song if he doesn’t like this one, but don’t change the lyrics. It’s a classic, perfect song.</blockquote>
      <p>Osbourne later chimed in during <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/entertainment/sharon-osbourne-john-legend-kelly-clarkson-trnd/index.html">a segment on <i>The View</i></a>. “It’s a piece of art,” she said. “To change an innocent lyric, to what is it, ‘your mind and your body?’ What the hell are you on? That’s ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>“Honestly, the original doesn’t even offend me,” Clarkson said. “I just was like, ‘Cool, we’ll do another version.’”</p>
