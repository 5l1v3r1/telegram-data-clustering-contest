      <h1>Grab a new Moto G6 for an all-time low price of $120 ($130 off) on Amazon and B&amp;H</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:55:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/zach-laidlaw/" target="_blank">Zach Laidlaw</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/13/the-foldable-moto-razr-is-official-coming-exclusively-to-verizon-on-january-9th-for-1500/">recently unveiled Moto Razr</a> may be the hot new item in Motorola's hardware pipeline, but the phone manufacturer has also made quite a name for itself with its affordable range of mid-tier devices. Right now, you can grab a brand new Moto G6 for the lowest price we've ever seen on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moto-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-Warranty/dp/B07WSJYDXX?tag=androidpolice-20&amp;th=1">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1400284-REG/moto_paae0000us_moto_g6_32gb_smartphone.html/BI/19931/KBID/13015">B&amp;H</a>, starting at just $119.99.</p>
      <p>The Moto G6 featured in today's deal comes with a 5.7" HD+ display, 13 MP camera, and a battery big enough to last through an entire day on a single charge. Under the hood lies a 1.4 GHz octa-core processor, 32GB or 64GB of storage, and 3 GB of RAM. These Moto G6 models are factory unlocked, and they are able to run on both GSM and CDMA networks, including AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/03/moto-g6-deals-amazon-bogo/">last time we saw the 64GB Moto G6 this low</a> was in early October, and even then it was still a bit more expensive than it is today. As for the 32GB version, the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/04/05/moto-g6-and-g6-play-drop-to-160-150-at-multiple-retailers/">April 2019 sale</a> didn't even come close to the money you can save now. To redeem this offer, just put one of these fellas into your cart and check out — no codes or coupons necessary.</p>
