      <p>Cannagistics, Inc. (OTCMarkets: "CNGT”) (the "Company” or "Cannagistics”) continues to work on the year end audit and Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. Our internal accounting firm was involved in conflicting commitments and had limited resources this caused a delay in compiling the necessary information to complete the necessary financial work for the Company. As a result of this, the Company has retained a new internal accounting firm, Ms. Jona Barnes, E.A., a Partner at Mallett &amp; Barnes Tax Service of San Diego, CA to complete the accounting necessary to complete the Audit being done by our current PCOAB Auditing Firm, BMKR, LLP.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated that the Audit and Form 10-K filing will be completed on December 6, 2019.</p>
      <p>James Zimbler, President of <a href="https://www.finanzen.net/aktien/cannagistics-aktie">Cannagistics</a> stated, "Everyone at the Company has been working diligently to complete the year end filing. Bringing on a highly competent professional to take over from our previous accountant will allow us to complete the process.”</p>
