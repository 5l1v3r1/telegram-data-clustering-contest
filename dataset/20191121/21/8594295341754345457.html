      <p>Before long, there’ll be hip-hop songs written about what went on in the back of Mercedes-Maybach’s largest offering.</p>
      <p>Revealed Thursday, the Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 4Matic is essentially a Mercedes-Benz GLS that’s been to finishing school, put on airs, and is now ready to float above the riff-raff at a cruising altitude of 40,000 feet, sipping on champagne all the way. The automaker provides the silver flutes for just such a drinking experience, as well as the (three-bottle) fridge.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Mercedes-Maybach’s product boss implied that the vehicle’s customers might be used to viewing the world from such a lofty height.</p>
      <p>Dispensing with the third-row seats found in the Mercedes-Benz GLS, Maybach’s creation offers no more than five seating positions, but it seems you’ll be much more pampered in four-seater guise. Yes, this monstrous, full-size SUV can be had as a 2+2, which is two occupants less than the executive cabin of most Learjets.</p>
      <p>Stretching out will not be a problem, what with the reclining outboard seats. Indeed, crafting a Maybach SUV was a no-brainer, given the way the industry’s going.</p>

      <p>“The SUV vehicle concept has a major advantage for the luxury segment: the high seating position. In combination with the running boards, this makes access and egress outstandingly easy and convenient,” said Martin Hülder, head of product management at Mercedes-Maybach, in a statement.</p>
      <p>He added, perhaps metaphorically, “Furthermore, the raised position gives the occupants a different perspective of the surroundings, and many Mercedes-Maybach customers greatly appreciate this.”</p>

      <p>Powering this hulking luxo-barge is a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 (numbers mean nothing these days, so attribute the “600” designation to the vehicle’s status, not its displacement), good for 550 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque, that routes its grunt to all four wheels through a beefed-up 9G-Tronic automatic. There’s a hidden power punch, too, in the form of a 48-volt mild hybrid system.</p>
      <p>Called EQ Boost, the belt-starter generator adds up to 21 additional horsepower and 184 lb-ft when the driver (chauffeur) pins the throttle. EPA-estimated fuel economy figures are not yet available, but you can be sure this particular performance figure is something few buyers will concern themselves with.</p>

      <p>Yes, it’s all about the luxury here — from the Airmatic suspension that drops 25 mm at rest to the available 22- and 23-inch wheels, the 6.8-feet-long anodized aluminum running boards that deploy and retract in 1.5 seconds, the eight two-tone color combinations, all the way down to the backrest-mounted MBUX rear-seat entertainment system and specially crafted fragrance. That scent is white osmanthus blossom, by the way.</p>
      <p>Like the full-length console with fridge, a bespoke smell can be ordered to jazz up the vehicle’s cabin. Just tick the box for the Air Balance package and await the aroma of leather and spicy tea. Mercedes-Maybach claims its testers found it to be “floral and light.”</p>

      <p>Obviously, there’s enough niceties — both comfort and safety-related — in this vehicle to make a Rockefeller blush, so do we really need to list them? Mercedes-Maybach would be happy, perhaps, to tell you more in person. Wear your Sunday best.</p>
      <p>The GLS 600 4Matic goes on sale in the U.S. in the latter half of 2020. Watch for its distinctive face in music videos shortly thereafter.</p>
