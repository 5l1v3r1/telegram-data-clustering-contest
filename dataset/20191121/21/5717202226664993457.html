      <p>Carlo Ancelotti is reportedly looking to sign Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira in the January transfer window on loan for Napoli, but faces competition from AC Milan – and Gunners fans have reacted on Twitter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10391638/arsenal-lucas-torreira-ac-milan-napoli-january-transfer-window-agent/">The Sun has claimed</a> that Napoli and Milan want to sign Torreira in January, as part of an 18-month loan deal with an obligation to buy based on appearances. It means Torreira may only sign permanently for either club in the summer of 2021.</p>
      <p>Torreira is said to have become unsettled at The Emirates. The Uruguay international is upset that Unai Emery has changed his position, and his agent has recently confirmed that there is plenty of interest in the £26million signing (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44764063">BBC</a>).</p>

      <p>Arsenal are lacking in options in the middle of the park. The captaincy situation surrounding Granit Xhaka has seen him ostracised, while Arsenal waved goodbye to Mohamed Elneny and Aaron Ramsey in the summer.</p>
      <p>Dani Ceballos is injured for the clash against Southampton this weekend, leaving the Gunners with just Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi as options in the middle of the park. The duo are expected to start, as is Mesut Ozil.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans reacted to the reported news on Twitter that Napoli and Milan are looking to sign Torreira on loan in the January transfer window until the end of the 2020-21 season – and many would rather a permanent sale.</p>
