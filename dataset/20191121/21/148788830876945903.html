      <h1>‘The Staircase’ TV Adaptation Will Bring Harrison Ford to Television For the First Time in 25 Years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:30:45+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p>The True Crime docu-series <b><i>The Staircase</i></b> is getting a dramatized TV series adaptation, and the show has landed itself a big star. <b>Harrison Ford </b>is attached to star as Michael Peterson, who was accused of murdering his wife. Peterson’s defense was that his wife, Kathleen Peterson, died as a result of a fall down a staircase. This lead to a sensational trial, and a much-talked-about docu-series chronicling the events.</p>
      <p>One of Harrison Ford’s best roles was that of a man accused of murdering his wife in <i>The Fugitive</i>. Now, Ford is gearing up to proclaim he didn’t murder his wife yet again with <i>The Staircase</i>. <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/harrison-ford-the-staircase-series-1203411141/">Variety</a> reports Ford is set to star in a <i>The Staircase</i> TV adaptation, based on the True Crime docu-series of the same name. The original docu-series originally aired in 2004, but Netflix bought the rights to the series and filmed three new episodes, which arrived in 2018.</p>
      <p><i>The Staircase</i> “is the compelling story of Michael Peterson, a crime novelist accused of killing his wife Kathleen after she is found dead at the bottom of a staircase in their home, and the 16 year judicial battle that followed.” The docu-series leans heavily on the idea that Peterson was indeed innocent, although it’s worth noting that Peterson was in a romantic relationship with the docu-series’ editor, Sophie Brunet.</p>
      <p>In addition to the theory that Kathleen Peterson died due to a fall, there’s <i>another</i> theory that an owl might have been responsible for her death. Yes, really. See for yourself. It’s actually <i>kind of</i> convincing.</p>

      <p><i>The Staircase</i> TV adaptation comes from Annapurna TV, who are currently shopping the show to networks and streaming services. Antonio Campos will write and executive produce. Ford will also executive produce.</p>
      <p>Casting Ford as Peterson is a great idea. He vaguely resembles the real man, but he’s also the right type of actor to play the part of a guy you can’t quite pin down. He <i>might</i> be innocent, but then again, he <i>might</i> be guilty. This will be Ford’s first TV role since his appearance on <i>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</i> in 1993, where he played Indiana Jones, but with a beard.</p>
