      </h3>
      <p>A hunt with hounds was underway at the time in the forest where she was walking her own dog.</p>
      <p>An autopsy showed that she died of bleeding after several dog bites to the upper and lower limbs and the head.</p>
      <p>Frederic Trinh, the public prosecutor leading the investigation into her death, said Thursday that DNA tests had been carried out on 67 dogs - 62 from the hunting club and five belonging to Pilarski and her partner.</p>
      <p>An investigation has been launched against persons unknown - a common procedure in France at the start of a probe - for manslaughter due to carelessness or negligence.</p>
      <p>Trinh said that police still had no main line of inquiry.</p>
      <p>He confirmed that Pilarski had phoned her partner, who was at work, before the attack to tell him that she had come across "threatening dogs".</p>
      <p>In a Facebook message she also wrote that a German shepherd was on the prowl but police had yet to identify that dog, Trinh said.</p>
      <p>Pilarski's partner Christophe told BFM channel that when he arrived on the scene around 45 minutes later he came across hunting hounds first of all and a rider.</p>
      <p>He then saw a pack of "around 30" dogs near a ravine where he found her body as well as the couple's own dog Curtis, whom he said had been bitten on the head.</p>
      <p>Sobbing during the interview, he told BFM that what he initially mistook for a log turned out to be Pilarski's bare stomach.</p>
      <p>She was "entirely undressed" and had been "bitten all over," he said.</p>
      <p>"It can only be the hunt," he said.</p>
      <p>According to local newspaper Le Courrier Picard, the hounds were hunting deer.</p>
      <p>Hunting associations have however denied that they could be to blame.</p>
      <p>The Paris-based French hunting association said in a statement that "nothing shows the involvement of hunting hounds in the death of this woman".</p>
      <p>France has more than 30,000 hunts with hounds in total and the association stated that "these dogs are trained to hunt a particular animal and obey man in all circumstances".</p>
