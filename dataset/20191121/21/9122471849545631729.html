      <h1>Will Muschamp Is Considering Changes For The Clemson Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:27:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>The indications out of Columbia are that Will Muschamp will return to coach South Carolina for 2020. School president Robert Caslen and athletic director Ray Tanner have issued support for the embattled fourth-year Gamecocks coach, though Caslen’s <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/south-carolina/will-muschamp-hot-seat-buyout-contract-south-carolina-clemson-robert-caslen-ray-tanner-florida-state">open discussion of Muschamp’s buyout</a> reveal the biggest issue with moving on from him after what will likely finish as a four-win season.</p>
      <p>Muschamp will be owed over $19 million if he’s let go before Dec. 30, and his buyout is still over $18 million after that date.</p>
      <p>Caslen did leave some wiggle room in his vote of confidence for Muschamp. The Gamecocks close their season with rival Clemson, and while there is no expectation that the team will pull its second giant comeback of the year, showing well against the Tigers is still important.</p>
      <p>When asked about the Nov. 30 Palmetto Bowl, Caslen was a bit less vociferous in maintaining that Muschamp is the guy moving forward. From <i><a href="https://www.scnow.com/news/local/caslen-usc-ad-asked-fsu-about-how-it-managed-its/article_2fc87775-6600-58c6-b371-a9a9b8c151a3.html">The Morning News</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>“If we’re totally imploding and no one shows up, I’d say we’ll have a discussion,” Caslen said. “But there’s no desire intended to make a change.”</blockquote>
      <p>One of the biggest issues for South Carolina in that game is in the trenches. Clemson doesn’t have the same four NFL linemen across its defensive front as last season, but remains very talented in that spot. Defensive coordinator Brent Venables has also supplemented the lost defensive line superstars with a bevy of blitzes this year, which is a change from recent seasons.</p>
      <p>That is bad news for a Gamecocks offensive line that has struggled to move the ball on the ground in recent weeks, with 66 total yards to their name against Texas A&amp;M and Appalachian State.</p>
      <p>With a bye week ahead of the finale against Clemson, Will Muschamp may shake things up on the offensive line.</p>

      <p>Muschamp’s job may not be in immediate danger, but he’ll enter 2020 on a very hot seat. He could really benefit from a respectable game against Clemson, even if an upset win is a bit much to ask for.</p>
