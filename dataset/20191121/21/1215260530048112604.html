        <b>Samuel Bailey is the 2020 Rhodes Scholar.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Governor General Sir Patrick Allen made the announcement moments ago at a ceremony at King's House.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old attended Ardenne High School before moving on to the University of the West Indies, Mona and then to the Cave Hill Campus in Barbados where he studied law.</p>
      <p>He then graduated from the Norman Manley Law School and was called to the bar in Jamaica last Friday.</p>
      <p>He is now employed at the Caribbean Court of Justice in Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, it has not fully settled in yet, because I had gone for it last year and got the runners up spot. So I wasn't even anticipating getting it, but now I'm relieved and happy," Bailey told <b>The Gleaner</b>.</p>
      <p>The Rhodes Scholarship is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Oxford.</p>
      <p>It was established in 1902</p>
      <p>Bailey joins a long list of Jamaicans to be selected for the prestigious scholarship including Ronald Thwaites in 1968, Delroy Chuck in 1973  and current finance and planning minister Dr Nigel Clarke.</p>
