      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has stunned her I'm A Celebrity campmates by revealing just how many grandchildren she has.</p>
      <p>As it so often does in the jungle when everyone's thousands of miles from home and their families, talk turned to families and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-17271943">Caitlyn</a> opened up about her children after Kate Garraway asked what they called her.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has six children - Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner, Brody Jenner, Brandon Jenner, Cassandra Marino and Burt Jenner and was step-father to the Kardashian children Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Rob.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, 70, said “My kids all call me Dad, Kendall asked me first and I said ‘Dad’, I’m your Dad and I’ll always be your Dad till the day I die.  But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, my Dad she and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it.”</p>
      <p>Kate asked if Caitlyn felt like their Father, Caitlyn said “Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them.”</p>
      <p>Kate then asked how many grandchildren Caitlyn had, and she said “20 in December.” Kate said “Wow, what do they call you?” to which she replied “They’ve come up with ‘Boom Boom’, it kinda stuck, it was easy for them to say.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Caitlyn overtook <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/ian-wright-quit-im-celebrity-17297428">Ian Wright</a> to become bookies favourite to win I'm A Celebrity but has since been replaced by new joint favourites Jacqueline Jossa and Roman Kemp.</p>
