      <p>DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Syrian animal-lover Samer al-Homshi affectionately pets and kisses his pet lions and tigers as though they are domestic house cats.</p>
      <p>In a Damascus suburb, Homshi houses the ferocious animals in a two-storey building along with bears, birds, dogs, and sheep, and dreams of sharing his pets with the public.</p>

      <p>There are around 37 animals in Homshi’s shelter and he recently applied to share them with the state-owned al-Adawi zoo. He wishes to transform the small zoo into a major city attraction.</p>
      <p>It costs him nearly 100,000 liras ($194) per day to feed and care for his beloved animals. He also sells new-borns to people who share the same love for animals.</p>
      <p>He does not receive visitors currently but hopes to one day open his own private zoo. </p>
