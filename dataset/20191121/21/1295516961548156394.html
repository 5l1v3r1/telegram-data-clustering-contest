      <p>According to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/swamp-thing-tv/">Swamp Thing</a> writer and executive producer Gary Dauberman, big things were planned for Season 2 of the horror-oriented DC Universe series before it's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/swamp-thing-dc-universe-cancellation-statement/">cancelation was announced</a>.</p>
      <p>"Season 1 is very much like a movie in that it has a beginning, middle and end, and is one story told over the course of 10 episodes and what I liked a lot about the comics is that there's like werewolf in a hospital and things like that, so we would have had episodes like an anthology with standalone stories," Dauberman told <a href="https://www.comicbookmovie.com/tv/dc/swamp_thing/swamp-thing-executive-producer-and-writer-gary-dauberman-reveals-scrapped-season-2-plans-exclusive-a171702">ComicBookMovie</a>.</p>

      <p>Dauberman goes on to talk about how the second season would lean more into the horror aspects and weirdness presented in the first season. "The swamp is very much the kitchen sink of supernatural terror and, as you know, you can go into different subgenres of horror with that and I was really looking forward to exploring that in season two and getting into some of the more twisted horror tales from the later comics. It just would have got weirder."</p>
      <p><i>Swamp Thing</i>'s cancellation was announced only a week after Season 1 premiered on DC Universe. Many fans and even some <a href="https://www.cbr.com/swamp-thing-fan-support-resurrect-show/">series actors</a> have voiced hope the series could be revived at some point in the future.</p>
