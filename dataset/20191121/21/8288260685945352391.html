      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | Speculation is starting to ramp up ahead of the re-opening of the transfer window in January when Dean Smith's side will be able to sign players</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:10:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:10</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/, Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>January could be a crucial month for Aston Villa's hopes of surviving relegation back to the Championship.</p>
      <p>After 12 matches - and ahead of a crucial Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Monday night - <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a>'s side sit in 17th place in the table and three points ahead of Watford in the final relegation spot.</p>
      <p>The New Year represents a chance for Smith and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> to improve on their current squad and ship players out who are not needed.</p>
      <p>Villa have been perennially linked with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> of Rangers, with the Colombian hot-shot impressing in recent weeks.</p>

      <p>But a couple of unfamiliar names have been touted with possible moves to Villa Park as speculation begins to ramp up ahead of the re-opening of the transfer window.</p>
      <p>Here's every player linked with a move to Villa...</p>
      <h4>Nico Gaitan</h4>
      <p>Reports in The Guardian on Thursday claimed the Argentina international is on the radar of Villa and Premier League rivals West Ham United and Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>It <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/nicolas-gaitan-aston-villa-transfer-17293882">is said the Hammers hierarchy have held preliminary talks</a> with Gaitan's representatives about a move, with the 31-year-old most recently of MLS side Chicago Fire.</p>
      <p>He will be a free agent when his contract is up in December and there is an option to stay with Chicago for the 2020 season.</p>
      <h4>Christoph Monschein</h4>
      <p>Reports on the continent suggested the Austria international <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-monitoring-international-striker-17294200">could be in line for a move to Villa</a> for a cut-price €5 million fee.</p>
      <p>He has scored 13 goals in 18 games this season for Austria Wien - and it is claimed that Dean Smith's side have sent scouts to watch him in action.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Alfredo Morelos</h4>
      <p>Morelos has been heavily linked with a move to Villa, his impressive performances north of the border highlighting a goal threat that Villa currently lack up front.</p>
      <p>Rangers are desperate to keep hold of him, though, with boss Steven Gerrard and recruitment chief Ross Wilson issuing a firm 'not for sale' warning.</p>
      <h4>Glen Kamara</h4>
      <p>Villa are one of a number of clubs linked with the Finnish international. After arriving at Ibrox in January for £50k, the midfielder has flourished under Gerrard's leadership and they are expecting a major profit on their investment.</p>
      <p>Along with Villa - Brighton, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Leeds United have all been credited with an interest.</p>
      <h4>Jarrod Bowen</h4>
      <p>A transfer rumour that could only happen in the 21st century.</p>
      <p>The Hull City forward got tongues wagging, when he followed the club on Instagram last week.</p>
      <p>The Leominster-born 22-year-old has been linked with big-money moves to Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Southampton.</p>

      <h4>Omar Elabdellaoui</h4>
      <p>Reports in the Daily Mail state that <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-omar-elabdellaoui-transfer-17082421">Villa are among a number of clubs chasing the Olympiacos defender,</a> along with Leicester City, Watford, Bournemouth and Burnley.</p>
      <p>Elabdellaoui's contract with the Greek top flight side is running out in the summer and the 27-year-old will be a free agent when it expires.</p>
      <p>As things stand, the Norway international can sign a pre-contract agreement at the turn of the year with an English side.</p>
      <p>Elabdellaoui left Manchester City to join Olympiacos in 2014 without making a single appearance for the current Premier League champions in a five-year stay.</p>
      <h4>Sam McCallum</h4>
      <p>The young full-back has impressed for Coventry City this season and has admitted to being 'flattered' by speculation linking him with a move out of League One.</p>
      <p>Villa, Leeds United and West Bromwich Albion are all rumoured to be interested in the 19-year-old.</p>
      <h4>Eric Dier</h4>
      <p>Dier has been linked with Villa after Smith's side were placed among the favourites to sign him by the bookies.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has struggled for minutes at Tottenham this season, making just three Premier League appearances so far.</p>
      <p>Amid suggestions he could be made available for transfer, former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/09/23/eric-dier-set-first-spurs-appearance-season-dele-alli-nears/">the Telegraph</a> in September: "It has been difficult [for Dier]. Of course it is tough for him.</p>
      <p>“He has to wait through training and then of course he has the opportunity. He has to try to fight for his place.</p>
      <p>“We have a big squad, I need to take the decision performance by performance. The plan is the plan. We are going to assess the player and then make the decision.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United are said to be Dier's most likely destination, followed by Everton, with Villa rated as third favourites to sign him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Ben Chrisen</h4>
      <p>Chrisen is one for the future.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old midfielder, currently with Exeter City, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-club-17194865">is also said to be wanted by Chelsea</a> , Liverpool and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <h4>Dennis Politic</h4>
      <p>Villa have been keen to sign young players with the potential to grow and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-scouting-one-time-17050985">19-year-old Politic is on the radar according to Football Insider.</a></p>
      <p>The former Manchester United academy talent has been catching the eye in League One this term for troubled Bolton, who are rooted to the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>The Trotters signed nine new players after their ownership crisis with the Romanian among the very few to have kept a place in the starting XI.</p>
      <p>He has previously represented Romania at under-17 level and spent six years at United before joining Bolton's under-15s.</p>
      <p>Politic has two goals to his name so far this campaign having played on both wings.</p>
      <h4>Olivier Giroud</h4>
      <p>Not a player linked with Villa necessarily, but the claret and blue faithful want to bring the Chelsea striker to Villa Park <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-giroud-17254658">after hearing he will be available for a cut-price fee of £6m</a>.</p>
      <p>He would certainly be a good back-up to Wesley and bolster the forward department, but a move to Inter Milan and a reunion with former Chelsea coach Antonio Conte looks most likely.</p>

      <h3>RUMOURED DEPARTURES</h3>
      <h4>John McGinn</h4>
      <p>McGinn's excellent early-season form saw calls for Manchester United and Liverpool to sign the Scotland international.</p>
      <p>He has taken to the Premier League well, scoring three goals in 12 games including Villa's first back in the Premier League in the 3-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <h4>Jack Grealish</h4>
      <p>All the talk about Grealish now is whether he will be able to shake off a calf injury in time for the Newcastle United match on November 25.</p>
      <p>He was in fine form until he suffered the injury against Manchester City in October.</p>
      <h4>Jonathan Kodjia</h4>
      <p>Besiktas have been linked with a move for the out-of-favour striker.</p>
      <p>The forward has seen his game-time limited upon Villa's return to the Premier League, the 30-year-old playing just 20 minutes of League football this season.</p>
      <p>He's spent most of 2019-20 out injured with a cheekbone problem, but he returned to full fitness last month and managed just four minutes in two games.</p>
      <h4>Lovre Kalinic</h4>
      <p>Smith has been given the green light to sell Lovre Kalinic this summer, according to reports.</p>
      <p>It is less than a year since the Croatia international made the move to B6, but he has endured a nightmare spell at Villa Park, with both parties now willing to cut their losses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/smith-gives-green-light-for-aston-villa-to-sell-his-signing/">Football Insider</a> have reported that Smith is planning to shift the 29-year-old, who Villa signed for £7m last January.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>WHEN DOES THE TRANSFER WINDOW OPEN?</h4>
      <p>The window opens again on Wednesday, January 1 2020.</p>
      <h4>WHAT IS VILLA'S RECORD TRANSFER FEE PAID?</h4>
      <p>This is a bone of contention because of the way transfers are structured with add-ons and the like. In terms of an up-front payment, Wesley's move from Club Brugge is the current record fee paid by Villa at £22m.</p>
      <h4>WHAT IS VILLA'S RECORD TRANSFER FEE RECEIVED?</h4>
      <p>The reported £32.5m that Liverpool paid for Christian Benteke is by far and away the most the claret and blues have received for a player.</p>
