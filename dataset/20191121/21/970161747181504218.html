      <p>Clint Eastwood’s new film Richard Jewell has been called out for it’s ‘sex-for-tips’ reporter storyline.</p>
      <p>The movie, which is set to be released in the new year, follows American security guard, Richard Jewell, as he saves a number of people’s lives from the 1996 Olympic bombing, in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>But while the main focus is on the hero himself, it also takes a look at how the newspapers reported on the incident at the time.</p>
      <p>After one of his unnamed colleagues watched the upcoming release at a media screening, AJC editor-in-chief Kevin G. Riley has called out the film.</p>
      <p>He claimed that the movie shows Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs trading sex in exchange for a tip on a story.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/atlanta-journal-constitution-editor-questions-accuracy-of-clint-eastwoods-richard-jewell-ahead-of-premiere/">Writing to The Wrap, the journalist shut down these accusations</a> and said there is no evidence to prove this happened.</p>

      <p>Kathy, who is portrayed by Olivia Wilde, sadly passed away in 2011 at the age of 42.</p>
      <p>In the note obtained by the publication, Riley states: ‘There is no evidence that this ever happened, and if the film portrays this, it’s offensive and deeply troubling in the #MeToo era.</p>
      <p>‘Kathy Scruggs was the AJC reporter who got the initial information that law enforcement was pursuing Jewell. Scruggs was known as an aggressive reporter and committed journalist who sought always to beat her competition.’</p>

      <p>He went onto defend the newspaper’s approach in reporting on the tragic incident.</p>
      <p>Riley added: ‘This is essential because the underlying theme of the movie is that the FBI and press are not to be trusted. Yet the way the press is portrayed often differs from reality.’</p>
      <p>Clint Eastwood himself is yet to speak out on the backlash.</p>
      <p>The film is set to drop onto the silver screen 31 January 2020 and has released a synopsis on IMDB.</p>
      <p>This reads: ‘American security guard Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) saves thousands of lives from an exploding bomb at the 1996 Olympics, but is vilified by journalists and the press who falsely report that he was a terrorist.’</p>
