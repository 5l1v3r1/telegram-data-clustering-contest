      <p>Cape Town - Former England bowler <b>Darren Gough</b> has named his best-ever cricket XI with former South African legends <b>Jacques Kallis</b> and <b>Allan Donald</b> selected.</p>
      <p>Gough revealed his all-time XI on the <b>Lord's Cricket </b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8lxZgwkF5I">YouTube channel</a>, with the criteria being that he had to have played with or against them, or have been strongly influenced by the players mentioned.</p>
      <p>The Englishman named the usual suspects, which included Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne, who regularly make such lists.</p>
      <p>Former Proteas legend Kallis slotted in at No 5 on Gough's list.</p>
      <p>"... That elegant flick off his legs, the best all-rounder I've ever played against by a long shot," said Gough.</p>
      <p>Kallis, who retired from international cricket in 2014, played 166 Tests for South Africa scoring 13 289 runs and taking 292 wickets in the process.</p>
      <p>Donald came in at No 9 on the Englishman's list with the Gough revealing that the South African "scared me to death when I used to go and bat against him."</p>
      <p>Donald retired from international cricket in 2003 and played 72 Tests for South Africa, taking 330 wickets at average of 22.25.</p>
      <p>Gough played 58 Tests, 159 ODIs and 2 T20Is for England between 1994-2006 before retiring from the game in 2008.</p>
      <p>He is currently <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/england-appoint-gough-as-fast-bowling-consultant-20191031">working with the England team</a> as their fast-bowling consultant for the two-Test series against New Zealand.</p>
