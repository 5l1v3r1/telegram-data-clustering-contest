      <p>It's going to cost more to get rid of certain types of garbage in the North Okanagan.</p>
      <p>Effective Jan. 1, residents will see an increase in fees for a number of accepted items at Regional District of North Okanagan landfills.</p>
      <p>The changes include an increase in the refuse disposal fee from $100 to $103 a tonne and an increase in the construction and demolition waste disposal fee from $200 to $250 a tonne.</p>
      <p>The minimum charge for garbage, wood waste and scrap metal will increase from $5 to $6.</p>
      <p>"This is the first diversion and disposal fee increase since January 2016. Diversion and disposal fees cover facility operating costs and fund facility capital and closure reserves," RDNO officials said in a release.</p>
      <p>"Additionally, fees are designed to encourage waste diversion and discourage waste disposal."</p>
