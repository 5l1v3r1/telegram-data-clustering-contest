      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jason-derulo">Jason Derulo</a> left fas hot under the collar with a photo that leaves little to the imagination.</p>
      <p>The singer, 30, posed for a steamy underwear shoot in a rainforest location, clad in nothing but tiny black boxer shorts.</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to point out a very clearly visible outline in his pants, which had them rather impressed.</p>
      <p>Jason's muscled frame and sizable manhood had his followers flocking to the comment section to find out if they were the only ones who noticed.</p>
      <p>One tagged her friends and asked: "did y’all zoom in".</p>
      <p>"All those inches, your new name is Jason DeRULER", joked another.</p>

      <p>"What animal are you hiding in your pants", questioned another, to which cheeky Jason replied "anaconda".</p>
      <p>Several others commented succinctly with the eggplant emoji.</p>
      <p>The new trailer for Jason's latest venture, the Cats movie, has received a brutal backlash after it was branded "creepy".</p>

      <p>One brutally tweeted: "The new trailer fot <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CatsMovie">#CatsMovie</a> isn't so bad if you close your eyes."</p>
      <p>Finally, one fan is realistic but hopeful: "You know what? I don’t care that the CGI is kinda creepy or that it probably can’t live up to the original show or any other complaint everyone’s been making.
