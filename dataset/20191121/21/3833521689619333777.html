      <h1>B.C. Securities Commission says crypto trader leaves millions of dollars owing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:06:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:06</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>VANCOUVER -- A receiver appointed to save the assets of the crypto trading platform Einstein Exchange has completed its work and asked to be released by a B.C. Supreme Court judge.</p>
      <p>The B.C. Securities Commission says in a news release that it applied for the appointment of an interim receiver after learning that customers funds might be at risk.</p>
      <p>It says the receiver's report to the court found that the Einstein Group has less than $45,000 in cash and cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>Yet, the commission says the receiver reported the group owes its customers between US$8 and US$10 million and there are outstanding claims from several unpaid suppliers.</p>
      <p>The receiver also shut down the trading platform's website and the commission says that resulted in customers no longer being able to deposit funds or purchase cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>The securities commission says it will continue its investigation and it, along with other Canadian securities regulators, urges Canadians to exercise caution when buying or selling any crypto-assets because of the risks involved.</p>
