          </p>
          <p>While the level of competition in the ongoing edition of the Women’s Big Bash League is unequivocal and unparalled as the clamour for a spot in the echelons of the points tally takes on a whole new meaning, we have the odd mismatch begin thrown our way as well. And one of that clash takes place today when top of the pile Brisbane Heat will be meeting seventh placed Hobart Hurricanes in a match which looks set o be a foregone conclusion even before the first ball is sent down.</p>
          <p>Both the sdes couldn’t have seen the league transpire more opposing for them with where Brisbane Heat have just lost three matches, Hobart Hurricanes on the other hand have managed to muster up a mere 3 wins in 10 matches. It’s a set of results which have left the side in disarray with the team persistently unravelling to be left minced, lambasted and lamented, facing massive backlash for their gaffe results.</p>

              <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146">
                <p>What will buoy the side ahead of today’s impending contest in the fact that one of their three wins came in their most recent outing in the league with the side managing to successfully chase down 135 against Sydney Sixers to win by 5 wickets. They know through that things are going to be far from straightforward and simple for them though today when they take on a Brisbane Heat side who’ll be further looking to hammer down their prevelant spot in the pinnacles of the points tally.</p>
                <p>Currently sitting in first place after defeating Melbourne Renegades in an edge of the seat thriller, the side come into this clash in exquisite form. Their resolve, will, valour and vigour was put to the fore the last time around but with a 6 run win as they managed to defend the 153 put on by them, the side showed they are able to squirm their way through tricky situations as well to become overwhelming favourites for the coveted trophy.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>A fresh wicket with this being the first match of the league to be contested over here, this is a track which will immensely favour the side coming out and batting first, a narrative which will subject the team winning the toss to peddle out a target. The surface does tend to regress as the match runs down its course but the new, shining nature of the track won’t deter the bats massively.</p>

                            <h3>HBW Vs BHW Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Beth Mooney has failed in the side’s recent encounters but the form the Brisbane Heat wicket-keeper has displayed across her life in the league is more than enough to incline us toward her selection. The player has been a steady and stable, bat with the opener constantly laying down a flawless foundation for her counterparts to build on from to see us opt for her for this tie as well.</p>
                            <h3>HBW Vs BHW Dream11 Batswomen</h3>
                            <p>After scoring 32runs in the opening slot the last time around, Maddy Green ensured that se compensated for a rare failure by her counterpart Mooney to see her become the first name to be inducted in our Dream 11 outfit of the day. </p>
                            <p>Laura Harris will also be coming from the side for us whilst from the other side of the docket we have decided to indulge in Corinne Hall after her 28 runs in 22 balls down the middle-order was just the impetuous her side needed to embark on a successful run chase.</p>
                            <h3>HBW Vs BHW Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>She will be accompanied by the fulcrum of her side in the batting order, Nicola Carey with the player’s match winning knock of an unbeaten 55 runs being the guiding force of her side’s win. The player put in place a pleasing to the eye display while Heather Knight comes in as well after shining with the ball to pick up 1-17 to stall her opponents from putting on a big target.</p>
                            <p>From the other side of the docket meanwhile we have decided to opt for Jess Jonassen with the player needing a mere 29 balls to smash her way to 63 runs. It was an innings which is spoken in the same breath as one of the best this instalment of the league owing to the circumstances and surface it came on to make her instant option along with Sammy Jo-Johnson who took two wickets with the ball.</p>
                            <h3>HB-W Vs BH-W Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Up against a lapses filled batting unit, we had to induct in the two bowlers from the table toppers for this clash with Delissa Kimmince and Georgia Prestwidge being opted to by us. The two make for a daunting unit, two players who’ll descend on this match as a disruptive force to Hobart Hurricanes batting travails as they keep peppering them with deadly deliveries.</p>
                            <p>Hobart Hurricanes meanwhile have just the one name come in with Belinda Vakarewa being our choice for this one after she ended up snaring an impressive spell of 4-19 in the side’s last clash.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Jess is our side’s undisputed captain whilst Knight will be our vice-captain.</p>
