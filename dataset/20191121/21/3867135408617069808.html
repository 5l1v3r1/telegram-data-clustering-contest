      <p>EDMONDS — An Edmonds man allegedly stabbed his father to death, then turned himself into officers saying he’d committed a “premeditated homicide,” according to police.</p>
      <p>The son, 24, arrived at the Edmonds police station around 2:40 a.m. Thursday, reporting he’d killed his father at a home in the 18700 block of 84th Avenue W, police Sgt. Shane Hawley said in a news release.</p>
      <p>Officers went to the home and found the body of the father, 64, who had suffered multiple stab wounds, according to Edmonds police.</p>
      <p>“Based on previous contacts with the suspect, his family had reported that … he had a history of mental illness,” the sergeant wrote.</p>
      <p>The man told police he’d walked from the home to the police station, a distance of about 2½ miles. He phoned into the station from a call box.</p>
      <p>The man was expected to be booked into Snohomish County Jail for investigation of first-degree murder.</p>
