          <b>Jamie Lynn Spears is returning to Nickelodeon. </b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Before you think a <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/jamie-lynn-spears-teases-a-zoey-101-reboot-343336"><i>Zoey 101</i></a> reunion is in the works, it's not like that. However, her former co-stars will be involved.</p>
      <p>As well as the beloved Zoey, Jamie also used to play the character of Thelma Stump on the original All That. The bacon-loving bodyguard is coming back for a sketch in the revival of the show where she will be joined by her Pacific Coast Academy gang.</p>
      <p>It's not uncommon for the <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/zoey-101-reunion-different-dinner-333949"><i>Zoey 101</i></a> cast to have reunions, and over the years we've seen many on social media - Jamie Lynn has always been missing, though.</p>

      <p>Recently, <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/remours-zoey101-reboot-333227"><i>Spears</i></a> linked up with Paul Butcher, Sean Flynn, Kristin Herrera, Chris Massey, Erin Sanders and Matthew Underwood, and it gave us total nostalgia.</p>
      <p>The creator of Zoey 101, Dan Schneider, gave us goosebumps when he shared a picture of them all back together again.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Some Zoey 101 buzz got me talking with my good friend Sean Flynn (Chase) and within about 72 hours, this happened! I'm not sure how I feel about my new glasses, but that was one of the most fun nights ever. A wonderful cast of kids then, and even better all grown up! Much love/respect for all of you! Jamie Lynn is busy shooting her new show in Atlanta. We missed you, congrats.</p>
