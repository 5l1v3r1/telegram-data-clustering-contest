        <li>The Republican National Committee spent almost $100,000 to buy up copies of Donald Trump Jr.'s book, and it was probably a big reason he made it onto The New York Times best-seller list.</li>
        <li>"Triggered" debuted at the top of the New York Times best-seller list with a dagger symbol, indicating a large percentage of the book's sales came from "special interest" or bulk purchases. </li>
        <li>In a new campaign-finance filing, the RNC revealed it spent $94,800 at Books-A-Million just days before "Triggered" was released, telling a Times reporter it bought several books to keep up with demand. </li>
        <li>The Times reporter Nick Confessore said the RNC got more than its money's worth for the apparent bulk purchase of the book because Trump Jr. raised money for the Republican Party while promoting the book.</li>

      <p>The Republican National Committee spent almost $100,000 to buy up copies of Donald Trump Jr.'s book, and it was probably a big reason <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-book-linked-to-bulk-orders-republican-party-2019-11">he made it onto The New York Times bestseller list</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump Jr.'s book "Triggered," released on November 5, is partly a memoir and partly a scathing list of grievances against the left and the Democratic Party, which Trump Jr. casts as victimizing his father's presidency and his family. </p>
      <p>"Triggered" debuted at the top of the next week's New York Times best-seller list for nonfiction, with an important caveat: a dagger symbol indicating a large percentage of the book's sales came from "institutional, special interest, group, or bulk purchases."</p>
      <p>"It's known in the industry as the 'deadly dagger,'" a source told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/14/donald-trump-jr-may-have-bulk-purchased-his-own-book-to-juice-sales/?utm_source=P6Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">Page Six</a>. "A rare penalty that is only called for flagrant fouls."</p>
      <p>In a new filing with the Federal Election Commission, the RNC revealed it spent $94,800 at Books-A-Million just a few days before "Triggered" was released. The RNC told The New York Times' Nick Confessore that they "haven't made a large bulk purchase, but are ordering copies to keep up with demand" of "Triggered."</p>

      <p>Confessore said the RNC got more than its money's worth for the apparent bulk purchase of the book, with Trump Jr. raising money for the Republican Party while promoting the book.</p>
      <p>On the day of the book's release, the RNC <a href="https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/1191850257161826304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">offered a free signed copy of "Triggered"</a> to anyone who donated more than $50 to the committee, which also presumably juiced sales of the book.</p>
