      <p>Limerick’s Paul Browne has retired from intercounty hurling at the age of 30. From the Bruff club, he enjoyed an 11-year career with the county and made his first championship start in the 2009 replay defeat by Waterford.</p>
      <p>His decision was announced on the Limerick GAA website on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Named vice-captain for the memorable 2018 season, he had the misfortune to miss out on the All-Ireland triumph due to a cruciate injury.</p>
      <p>“I leave with nothing but wonderful memories and pride from my 11 years playing with Limerick,” he said in his statement.</p>
      <p>“To have shared the dressing room with all my past team-mates and this incredible panel of players now has been the greatest honour of my life.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to supporting the 2020 panel and management and I would urge all Limerick supporters to do so. There are fantastic times ahead.”</p>
