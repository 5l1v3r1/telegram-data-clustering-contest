      <p><a href="http://nme.com/tag/stranger-things"><i>Stranger Things</i></a> star Finn Wolfhard has formed a new band just weeks after <a href="http://nme.com/artists/calpurnia">Calpurnia</a> split up.</p>
      <p>Wolfhard has formed a new outfit called The Aubreys. Very little is known about them other than the fact that they feature on the soundtrack to <i>The Turning </i>which he stars in alongside <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/black-mirror">Black Mirror’s</a> </i>Mackenzie Davis.</p>
      <p>The film <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/finn-wolfhard-the-turning-new-film-adaptation-henry-james-trailer-2555756">is inspired by the Henry James ghostly short story, <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>, and will be released in cinemas on January 24.</a></p>
      <p>The track by his new band is entitled ‘Getting Better(otherwise)’ and it features alongside original songs by <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/courtney-love">Courtney Love</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/mitski">Mitski</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/soccor-mommy">Soccer Mommy</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/warpaint">Warpaint</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/kali-uchis">Kali Uchis</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/kim-gordon">Kim Gordon</a>.</p>

      <p>Love revealed <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-courtney-loves-90s-inspired-new-song-mother-turning-soundtrack-2570265">her track ‘Mother’ earlier today (November 21)</a>. It is unclear when further tracks from the soundtrack including The Aubreys’ song will be released.</p>
      <p>The soundtrack, <a href="https://theturning.lnk.to/Mother">which you can pre-order here</a>, came together after the film’s director asked Lawrence Rothman to write an original song for the film. Lawrence in turn went to Love, who he knew was a fan of the short story.</p>
      <p>The tracklisting is below:</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhands-band-calpurnia-have-split-up-2566141#BUC3ZAE2I7ohYL0x.99">Wolfhard announced that his band Calpurnia were splitting up.</a></p>
      <p>The Canadian four-piece, who formed in 2017, took to Instagram to announce their ending. In a statement they wrote: “It’s bittersweet to share this news, but we want to let you know that our time playing together as Calpurnia has come to an end. We are extremely grateful for the support we’ve received over the past few years. What seemed to us like an unimaginable reality came to be, and we have been thrilled to share the ride with you.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Wolfhard recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-time-machine-nirvana-2555908">said he wants a time machine</a> to be developed so he can go back and see <a href="http://nme.com/artists/nirvana">Nirvana</a> play live.</p>
      <p>He is set to star in the forthcoming fourth season of <i>Stranger Things</i>.</p>
