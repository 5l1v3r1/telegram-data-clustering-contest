      <h1>49ers Insider Has Promising Update On TE George Kittle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:25:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>With a tough matchup looming this weekend against the Green Bay Packers, the San Francisco 49ers received positive news regarding their best offensive weapon. George Kittle is back at practice for the first time in roughly three weeks.</p>
      <p>San Francisco has managed to stay very competitive without Kittle. After suffering its first loss of the season to Seattle, the team bounced back with a win over Arizona.</p>
      <p>Ross Dwelley has filled in admirably for Kittle over the past few weeks, but the 49ers are obviously better with him on the field.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for head coach Kyle Shanahan, it appears his standout tight end is almost ready to return.</p>
      <p>Cam Inman of <i>The Mercury News</i> stated earlier this afternoon that Kittle looked relatively healthy in practice.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that Kittle wore a non-contact jersey during practice. Nonetheless, the All-Pro tight end was seen running routes on the practice field.</p>

      <p>Deebo Samuel was also on the practice field for the 49ers this afternoon. He missed yesterday’s practice due to a shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Sanders wasn’t practicing with the rest of the team, but he was stretching on the sidelines. Shanahan believes he’ll be a game-time decision.</p>
      <p>The 49ers are going to need their playmakers available this Sunday if they want to defeat the Packers.</p>
      <p>We’ll know more about Kittle’s status on Friday.</p>
