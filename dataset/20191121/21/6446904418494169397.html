      <h1>Russian banker helps Tories collect €6.6m in UK election funding</h1>
      <h2>The Tories received 87% of donations over £7,500 in the week after 6 November,</h2>

      <p>THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY has collected the majority of big donations to political parties since a general election was called in the UK, the Electoral Commission has said.</p>
      <p>The Tories, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, received £5.7 million (€6.6 million) in the week after 6 November – representing 87% of donations over £7,500 (€8,752).</p>
      <p>The anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats were the next largest recipients, gathering £275,000 (€320,921), followed by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party on £250,000 (€291,723).</p>
      <p>The Labour Party received £218,500 (€254,966) in big donations during the seven-day period, while the Green Party got £30,000 (€35,000).</p>
      <p>The figures were revealed in the first of several weekly reports to be released by the Electoral Commission – an independent body which oversees elections and regulates political finance – before the 12 December vote.</p>
      <p>They showed those giving to the Conservative Party included controversial banker Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who donated £200,000 (€233,380).</p>
      <p>Chernukhin, a British citizen, stoked controversy earlier this year after giving the party £135,000 (€157,532) to have dinner with then-prime minister Theresa May and other ministers.</p>
      <p>She has now given the Tories more than £1.4 million (€1.63 million) since 2012, according to Electoral Commission records.</p>
      <p>Her inclusion on the latest donors list could cause political headaches for the Conservatives, after the government this month delayed the publication of a parliamentary report into possible Russian interference in British politics.</p>
      <p>Johnson defended the move, which has prompted widespread criticism and concern, on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“There’s absolutely no evidence that I’ve ever seen of any Russian interference in UK democratic processes,” he said during a campaign stop in Teesside, northeast England.</p>
      <p>The biggest donation to his party came from billionaire theatre impresario John Gore, who made his fortune from staging musicals such as “Hamilton”, “Wicked” and “School of Rock”. He gave £1 million (€1.17 million).</p>
      <p>Countywide Developments, run by billionaire property mogul Tony Gallagher, gave £500,000 (€583,441).</p>
      <p>The biggest donation to the Labour Party came from the trade union Unite, which gave £62,000 (€72,352).</p>
      <p>The smaller Lib Dems’ major donor was an investment bank, Attestor Services, which gave £75,000 (€87,523).</p>
      <p>Jeremy Hoskins, an English businessman who made his money in investment and private equity, was the sole contributor to the Brexit Party.</p>
      <p>Labour immediately criticised the figures, noting that its average donation was £26 (€30) and that it had raised more than £1 million in “small donations” in the 10 days after the election was called last month.</p>
      <p>At the party’s manifesto launch Thursday leader Jeremy Corbyn accused “billionaires and the super-rich” of owning the Conservative Party and that he expected their opposition to his policies.</p>
