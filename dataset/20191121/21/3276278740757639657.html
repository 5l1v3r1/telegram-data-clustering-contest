      <h1>23 Questions for Greta Thunberg, 19th-Century Gold Miner and Time Traveler</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:58:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Yessenia Funes</a></address>
      <p>Some might say that individuals like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tag/greta-thunberg">Greta Thunberg</a>, the teen climate activist from Sweden, are one of a kind. Well, then, tell me what to make of <a href="https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/digital/collection/hegg/id/601/">this archived image</a> showing a Thunberg look-alike in the year 1898. If there is only one blessed Thunberg, what the hell is she doing in 19th-century Yukon mining gold?</p>
      <p>That is, of course, what many are asking after a <a href="https://twitter.com/JackSamStrange/status/1196514905320501248?s=20">tweet</a> calling Thunberg a time traveler from the future here to save us went viral. And I’m kinda into it. The similarities are uncanny: They both even rock the signature Thunberg braid! And look, Thunberg’s done a hell of a lot for a 16- year old. She not only helped make <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/thanks-greta-climate-strike-is-a-word-of-the-year-1839692678">“climate strike”</a> and <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/why-oxford-dictionarys-word-of-the-year-matters-this-ti-1839970234">“climate emergency”</a> words of the year, she also <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/fridays-global-climate-strikes-are-absolutely-massive-1838281025">took this form of protest global</a> to help elevate the urgency of the climate crisis. She <a href="https://kidsrights.org/advocacy/international-childrens-peace-prize/winners/">won</a> the International Children’s Peace Prize Wednesday, and that comes after a <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/16-year-old-climate-activist-greta-thunberg-has-been-no-1833290242">Nobel Peace Prize nomination</a> that she didn’t win—<a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/greta-thunberg-didnt-win-the-nobel-peace-prize-good-1838970358">which was for the best</a>—and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/world/greta-thunberg-nordic-award-decline-trnd/index.html">declining</a> another award last month.</p>
      <p>Thunberg is truly remarkable, so who’s to say she’s not a time traveler? She handles the climate crisis with <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/its-time-to-listen-to-the-teens-1838260629">more maturity</a> than most adults I know. Maybe that’s no coincidence, after all. She <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/how-dare-you-watch-greta-thunbergs-full-heart-wrenchi-1838367071">sits before the United Nations</a> with the kind of poise I still lack at 26. And she’s supposed to be 10 years younger than me?! No way. These conspiracy theorists may be onto something, man. Time-traveling is supposed to delay aging because <a href="https://gizmodo.com/yes-time-travel-is-possible-heres-how-1654958816">it involves outer space</a>, right?</p>
      <p>I put together a list of questions for Thunberg if she is, in fact, a 19th-century gold miner and time traveler. Earther will update if this “teen” (yeah, right) comes back with some answers.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>So, wait, are you actually a teen?</li>
        <li>How does time travel even work?</li>
        <li>Do your parents time travel with you?</li>
        <li>Are you even still a child?</li>
        <li>Is your time-traveling machine carbon-free?</li>
        <li>How can we believe anything you say now that we know we’ve been lied to?!</li>
        <li>Were you actually mining gold in this photo? Or was it… coal?!?</li>
        <li>Coal mining did <a href="https://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Curriculum%20Packets/Klondike/Klondike%20Main.html">begin in this area</a> in the 19th century. Could the photographer have been mistaken?</li>
        <li>
          <i>Exactly how much coal did you mine, Greta?!</i>
        </li>
        <li>Okay, let me chill. You’re a goddamn climate hero. You wouldn’t be mining coal… unless you still didn’t know it fueled climate change! Right?</li>
        <li>Speaking of, when did you discover climate change would become the biggest threat to humanity?</li>
        <li>But, wait, how the fuck did you wind up working in gold mines? Child labor is a stain on human history, but so is climate change, so I guess people have always sucked.</li>
        <li>Actually, have people always sucked?</li>
        <li>Have you been to the future?</li>
        <li>Do we still suck there?</li>
        <li>Does Twitter still exist? Please tell me no.</li>
        <li>Does U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez become president? Please tell me yes.</li>
        <li>Can you still travel to the past?</li>
        <li>If so, would you mind visiting the 1970s to stop oil companies like Exxon from <a href="https://gizmodo.com/exxon-scientists-knew-fossil-fuels-caused-climate-chang-1731707762?trending_test_b&amp;utm_expid=66866090-62._DVNDEZYQh2S4K00ZSnKcw.2&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">hiding their climate science</a> and <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-fossil-fuel-propaganda-machine-is-still-playing-the-1828225792">fueling the climate denial machine</a> that still has the American public brainwashed?</li>
        <li>Please?</li>
        <li>How about going back to the <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/">start of the Industrial Revolution</a> to let everyone know about the greenhouse effect?</li>
        <li>Too far? How about 2016 to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president of the United States and <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/bye-bye-paris-agreement-1839617211">killing</a> <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/trump-endures-nearly-15-whole-minutes-of-un-climate-sum-1838363838">our</a> <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-federal-attack-on-science-has-reached-a-crisis-poin-1838741826">climate</a> <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/there-is-not-a-climate-crisis-trump-administration-spo-1838444325">policies</a>?</li>
        <li>On second thought, do you mind never time-traveling again? I think the current timeline needs you if we’re actually going to solve this mess.</li>
