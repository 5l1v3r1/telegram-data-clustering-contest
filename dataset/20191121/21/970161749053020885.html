      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eden-hazard/">Eden Hazard</a> has confirmed that he gave Paris Saint-Germain a firm ‘no’ when they approached him over a potential summer transfer out of respect for former club Lille.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old made no secret of his desire to complete a move from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> towards the end of last season and finally got his wish when the two clubs agreed a fee of around €100million back in June.</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane identified Hazard as his number one attacking target at the beginning of the summer but the forward hasn’t quite had the impact he would have hoped for at the start of his Bernabeu career.</p>
      <p>However, Hazard has shown glimpses of his immense talent as he works his way back to full fitness and will be desperate to prove his worth when Madrid play host to Real Sociedad this weekend.</p>

      <p>Hazard would have returned to Ligue 1 had PSG got their way in the summer, but the Belgium international insists he would only ever return to France to play for Lille.</p>

      <p>‘I will never play for PSG. They have wanted me many times,’ he told<i> L’Equipe.</i></p>
      <p>‘I don’t have any intention to return to a Ligue 1 club other than Lille. I have always said no to them [PSG].</p>
      <p>‘In my head everything is clear. It is a team that would give you a chance of winning the Champions League, but they are not among my priorities.</p>
      <p>‘If I return to Ligue 1, it will be Lille.’</p>

      <p>Hazard has kept a close eye on the Premier League since his move to the Spanish capital and has been impressed by Frank Lampard’s start as Chelsea manager.</p>
      <p>Asked whether Chelsea can win at Manchester City this Saturday, Hazard told Sky Sports: ‘Of course I think so. It’s not going to be easy. It’s hard to play there.</p>
      <p>‘Last time we played them we lost 6-0, so bad memories for me and for Chelsea as well but I think this season they are really good.</p>
      <p>‘They are really young, but they are really good, so why not go there and win the game?</p>
      <p>‘When I watch them, no Hazard but it’s a party! They can score, they score a lot of goals, the fans are happy, they are third in the league, so it’s going to be a great season.</p>
