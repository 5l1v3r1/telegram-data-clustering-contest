      <h1>Aukey B80 Bluetooth earbuds on sale at all-time low of $40 ($40 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:28:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/jules-wang/" target="_blank">Jules Wang</a></address>
      <p>The last thing you want to be exposed to when you're making the long schlep to your grandma's for Thanksgiving dinner is a whole bunch of noise: crying babies on airplanes, incessant gossip on the train, non-stop snoring on the bus. You might want to feed your ears something more pleasant and keep the headphone jack out of this business with a pair of Bluetooth headphones. How about a pair of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/18/aukey-omni-power-giveaway-contest/">Aukey</a> Key Series B80 earbuds? They're basically half off if you stack a coupon that Amazon provides right on the buying page and put in a promo code!</p>
      <p>Our Taylor Kerns actually tried out the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/02/01/aukey-b60-bluetooth-earbuds-review-usb-c-charging-and-best-in-class-comfort-on-the-cheap/">B60 earbuds</a> earlier this year and found them to be modern and comfortable with passable sound that gets you buy. The newer B80, which we haven't had a chance to test, is presumably a step up. As with its cohort, it connects via Bluetooth 5, charges on USB-C, and lasts for 8 hours on a cycle. They're sweat-resistant (rated IPX6) and are supposed to sound better with a wider frequency output range. They come with three sizes of bud tips and a carrying case, too.</p>

      <p>As they are still fairly new, they're still listed at their original price of $80. They did get a sale at launch with an introductory price of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/17/grab-aukeys-b80-bluetooth-earbuds-for-44-45-off-with-this-deal/">$44</a>, though.</p>
      <p>Right now, however, if you check the box on the B80's Amazon page to get 20% off and then enter coupon code <b>X9ZLO6P4Â </b>at checkout, you'll get down to just about half-price at $40.</p>
