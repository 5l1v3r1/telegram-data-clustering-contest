      <h1>Row over Amazon cameras 'contributed to Mauricio Pochettino exit'</h1>
      <h2>A row over cameras installed by Amazon reportedly contributed to the breakdown in relations between <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-levy/"><b>Daniel Levy</b></a> that saw the former sacked.</h2>

      <p>The 47-year-old was replaced as Spurs boss earlier this week by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>, ending his five-and-a-half year association with the club.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's departure was attributed to a worsening relationship between him and Levy, with the <i>Daily Mail</i> reporting that a row over cameras added to the tension between the two.</p>
      <p>The report says that the Argentine wanted to install fixed cameras at the training ground in July to record training sessions, at a reported cost of Â£80,000 that Pochettino himself was prepared to pay, but Levy refused.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, cameras were installed in Pochettino's office to record content for the upcoming Amazon series profiling Tottenham's 2019/20 campaign, which the former Southampton coach saw as a step too far.</p>
