      <h1>Granit Xhaka 'wants showdown talks with Arsenal'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/granit-xhaka/"><b>Granit Xhaka</b></a> reportedly wants showdown talks with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a> after his recent issues with the club's fans.</h2>

      <p>The former Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder told fans of the North London club to "f*** off" after being substituted in their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/arsenal-vs-crystal-palace_game_92595.html">2-2 draw with Crystal Palace</a> last month, which ultimately led to him being stripped of the club's captaincy.</p>
      <p>Xhaka, who has not featured in any of the club's games since the incident, did subsequently issue an apology for his actions but he also criticised Arsenal fans for the abuse he's received on social media in recent months.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Swiss outlet <i>SRF</i> after playing in both of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/switzerland/"><b>Switzerland</b></a>'s recent Euro 2020 qualifiers, Xhaka said: "I have a clear idea as to how things should proceed, and Arsenal know this as well.</p>
      <p>"Although I still have a contract with them, I will be glad to return to the club - so we can finally sort matters out.</p>
      <p>"There will surely be a solution - as I can't accept what has happened with me."</p>
      <p>The Swiss player is thought to be in contention to feature in Arsenal's game with Southampton on Saturday afternoon.</p>
