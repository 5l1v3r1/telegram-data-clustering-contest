      <p>The Mets offseason has begun with the addition of an experienced reliever.</p>
      <p>Former Yankees left-handed reliever Chasen Shreve has signed a minor-league deal with a spring training invite, <a href="https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/1197619994517004288">MLB Network is reporting.</a></p>
      <p>Shreve was dealt by the Yankees, along with Giovanny Gallegos, to the Cardinals in July of 2018 for Luke Voit and bonus pool money. The following March, the Cardinals designated Shreve for assignment and sent him to Triple-A Memphis. He was recalled on July 11, but was designated for assignment again less than two weeks later. In 51 games for Memphis, Shreve had a 3.45 ERA and struck out 68 over 65 innings.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was effective in 2018, pitching to a 3.93 ERA with the Yankees and Cardinals, striking out 62 in 52.2 innings.</p>
