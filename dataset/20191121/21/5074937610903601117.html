      <p>Accra, Nov. 21, GNA - The Association Community Model Basic Junior High School (JHS) has won the National Commission for Civic Education Constitution (NCCE) Quiz for Basic Schools in the La Dadekotopon Municipality for the second year running.</p>
      <p>The 2018 champions garnered  58 points to beat off the competition from its closest contender, 5BN JHS, which bagged  a total of 55 points after series of tie breaker questions at the end of a three-round competition.</p>
      <p>The third position went out to La Wireless ‘1’with 43.8 points, Garrison JHS came fourth with 43.13, with La Emmaus Presby JHS and Tenashie JHS settling for the fifth and sixth positions, with points tally of 43.09 and 34 respectively.</p>
      <p>The lead school received a laptop, trophy and some pens and pencils; while the first runner up also got a tablet and similar stationery.</p>
      <p>The competition was divided into three parts - the first section focused on the 1992 Constitution, the Second was on Local Government with the Third section combining General Knowledge and Current Affairs.</p>
      <p>In all, 34 schools from six educational circuits, namely:  Airport Rangoon, Arakan, Adobetor, Adjetey, Emmaus and the Manle-Dada circuit  competed.</p>
      <p>The annual competition, organised by the municipality’s NCCE with support from the Municipal Assembly and the Member of Parliament for La Dadekotopon Constituency, is aimed at projecting the relevance of the 1992 Constitution to citizens.</p>
      <p>It is also to inculcate in the youth their civic responsibilities.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Ghana News Agency after they were declared winners, Ms Victoria Atumowe Atanga, a form three student, who represented her school, a Community Model Basic JHS, said the competition had increased her knowledge about the constitutional provisions for defending one’s self.</p>
      <p>They were excited for successfully defending their title, she said, despite the stiff competition they faced, especially from 5BN JHS.</p>
      <p>“We did really well when it came to studying the Constitution so when the tie-breaker questions were asked and they were based on the Constitution, we had it really easy and we won. We look forward to defending it in the coming years”.</p>
      <p>Mrs Gloria Amarkai Kudo, the NCCE Municipal Director, expressed her satisfaction over the level of competitiveness of this year’s competition.</p>
      <p>She said the Commission would continue to educate citizens on the Constitution and other important issues of national interest to foster participatory democracy.</p>
      <p>She expressed her appreciation to the Municipal Assembly and the MP, Mr Vincent Odotei Sowah, for their unwavering support in ensuring that the competition was a success.</p>
      <p>Mr Solomon Kotey Nikoi, the Municipal Chief Executive of LaDMA, in a speech read on his behalf, assured the Commission of the Assembly’s support to ensure that it discharged its mandate in educating the citizens effectively.</p>
      <p>For his part, Nii Koofeh IV, La Shikiteele, who chaired the programme,  urged the students to make education their priority to ensure a bright future.</p>
      <p>While commending the NCCE, the Municipal Assembly and the MP for a worthy cause, he urged them  to endeavour to sustain it to expand the knowledge base of the youth on their civic responsibilities.</p>
      <p>The participants were awarded with smart tablets, copies of the 1992 Constitution, supplementary readers and certificates of participation. </p>
