      <p>Jacqueline Jossa broke down on tonight's I'm A Celebrity as she struggled with being away from her kids.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/how-much-im-celebrity-stars-17295898">In tonight's show</a> Jacqueline woke up and was teary, talking in the Bush Telegraph she said: “I just woke up feeling a bit like ‘mmmm’ when you’re just looking up at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-late-campmates-confirmed-17289241">pure Jungle</a> and you think ‘wow, I’m so far away from home’.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline is married to TOWIE star Dan Osbourne and the pair have two young children Ella and Mia.</p>

      <p>Ian sat next to Jacqueline, 27, and comforted her as she was crying, he reassured her and said it would be ok and she won’t always be away from her family.</p>
      <p>Ian said: “She misses her kids which is natural, she misses her husband, everything like that.”</p>

      <p>Jacqueline said: “The thing is, everyone is missing their families, I just feel like it’s too soon to be crying missing your family…and we all smell so bad, we just stink, I stink, the smelliest I’ve ever been in my life.”</p>
      <p>Then <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-emily-atack-stuns-17290779">all the campmates</a> commented on how much they stunk, with morale at a low.</p>
      <p>James said: “So, I invented a game of ‘Quick draw’ where Caitlyn or an independent adjudicator would drop a hat, once the hat touches the floor, you reach for your water bottle, get it and drink it.”</p>
      <p>James and Ian played the game and Ian won, the camp cheered and called Ian the Sheriff, and he loved it.</p>
