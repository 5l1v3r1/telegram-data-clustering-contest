      <h1>'Climate emergency' is Oxford Dictionaries' 2019 word of the year</h1>

      <p>It's official — the 2019 word of the year is "climate emergency," according to Oxford Dictionaries.</p>
      <p>In an indication of the phrase's cultural impact, the organization said "climate emergency" was once relatively obscure, but after a huge spike in its usage this year, it has become one of the most prominent expressions among English speakers.</p>
      <p>Oxford defines climate emergency as "a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it."</p>
      <p>The organization said Thursdayit has monitored a steep increase in discussions about climate change, as well as an escalation in the sense of urgency about the situation.</p>
      <p>Usage of the term "climate emergency" is up 10,789 percent over the previous year, according to the dictionary's data.</p>

      <p>Related expressions such as "climate crisis" and "climate action" also made Oxford's Word of the Year 2019 shortlist.</p>
      <p>The trend seems to reflect a shift in the language surrounding climate change, with an emphasis on the seriousness of the current situation and a greater sense of immediacy in addressing it.</p>
      <p>In September 2018, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres<a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2018-09-10/secretary-generals-remarks-climate-change-delivered">declared that climate change is "the defining issue of our time,"</a> adding that humanity faces "a direct existential threat."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a new study backed by more than 11,000 scientists around the world<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/more-11-000-scientists-issue-fresh-warning-earth-faces-climate-n1076851">warned that Earth is facing a climate emergency</a>. The study said scientists have "a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat."</p>
      <p>Since 2004, Oxford has selected a word of the year from a word or phrase that has seen an upsurge of interest over the past 12 months. The institution chooses a winner based on data of its usage and other indicators of the word's cultural impact.</p>
      <p>Previous words of the year include "toxic" in 2018, "youthquake" in 2017 and "post-truth" in 2016.</p>
