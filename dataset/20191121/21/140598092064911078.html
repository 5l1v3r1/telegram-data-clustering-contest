      <h1>Bolton granted reprieve  as League One strugglers escape new points deduction</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:27:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/james-ducker/" target="_blank">James Ducker</a></address>
      <p>Bolton Wanderers were granted a reprieve on Thursday night after escaping an immediate points deduction for failing to fulfil two league fixtures.</p>
      <p>In a significant boost for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/17/sunderland-appoint-phil-parkinson-new-manager-two-and-a-half/">the embattled League One club</a>, Bolton have instead been handed a five-point deduction, which is suspended for 18 months, and a £70,000 fine over the non-fulfilment of fixtures against Brentford and Doncaster Rovers.</p>
      <p>Bolton already had a 12-point deduction after going into administration under their deeply unpopular previous owner, Ken Anderson. Another immediate points deduction could have effectively relegated the club but an independent disciplinary commission decided a suspended sanction was adequate in news warmly greeted by the club and their supporters.</p>
      <p>“We acknowledge the decision made by the panel and are pleased that these matters, which occurred under the previous administrations of the club, have now been resolved,” said Bolton chairman Sharon Brittan.</p>
      <p>“Our collective attention must now be fully focused on Keith Hill, his staff and players as we look to get as many points as we can to climb the Sky Bet League One table.</p>
      <p>“Bolton Wanderers supporters and staff have shown tremendous patience and passion throughout and we are now looking forward to working together to continue the rebuilding of this great football club.”</p>
      <p>Bolton were due to face Brentford on April 27 but their players refused to fulfil the fixture because of unpaid wages, which resulted in a suspended two-point penalty. The club also postponed their game against Doncaster on Aug 20 over welfare concerns for youth players, which earned them a further three-point suspended deduction.</p>
      <p>Bolton’s 1-0 victory over MK Dons last weekend lifted them out of a negative return and leaves them with one point from their opening 14 fixtures.</p>
      <p>Bolton are not expected to appeal against the ruling and the EFL said the Doncaster game would be rescheduled at the earliest opportunity.</p>
