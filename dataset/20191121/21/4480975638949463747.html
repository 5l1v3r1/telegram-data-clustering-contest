      <p>While speaking at the World Business Forum, the ex-Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Janet Yellen crossed wires via CNBC. The news conveys the ex-official's comments saying that Pronounced wealth inequality that has built up for decades poses a major threat to a US economy that is in otherwise “excellent” shape.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes</h3>
      <blockquote>US-China tariff war is having a detrimental impact both on businesses and consumers through higher prices and a general air of uncertainty.<br/><br/>While she doesn’t see a recession on the horizon, she also noted that the risks are piling up.<br/><br/>With three rate cuts this year, there remains “not as much scope as I would like to see for the Fed to be able to respond to that. So there is good reason to worry.”<br/><br/>Despite the central bank’s efforts to guide the economy, Yellen cited “a very worrisome long-term [trend] in which you have a very substantial share of the U.S. workforce feeling like they’re not getting ahead. It’s true, they’re not getting ahead.”</blockquote>
      <h4>FX implications</h4>
      <p>Even if markets ignored the news, this could exert additional downside on the risk-tone and could weigh on the AUD/USD that is currently taking rounds to 0.6790 by the press time of early Asian morning on Friday.</p>
