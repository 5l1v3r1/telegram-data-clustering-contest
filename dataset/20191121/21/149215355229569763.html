        <b><i>Game of Thrones</i> actor says they shot an alternate ending</b>
      </p>
      <p>The disappointing final season of <i>Game of Thrones</i> has led many fans to wish for a do-over (even if <a href="https://www.change.org/p/hbo-remake-game-of-thrones-season-8-with-competent-writers">that petition for HBO to film a whole new final season</a> seems a little pie-in-the-sky). But a new glimmer of hope has come from actor Kristofer Hivju, who played Tormund Giantsbane in the HBO drama. "We shot an alternative ending," said Hivju, adding that it was "mostly for fun" and that he wasn't sure if he was allowed to talk about it. (Our guess: Probably not!) Unfortunately, Hivju didn't spill any other details, so for now let's just go ahead and assume it ended with, you know, literally anyone else on the Iron Throne.

        <b>No, Brad Pitt and Alia Shawkat aren't dating</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brad Pitt and Alia Shawkat are two famous people who are <i>not</i>, to the best of anyone's knowledge, in monogamous relationships right now. So when the two hung out at an art gallery earlier this week, several tabloids leapt to the only possible reason a man and a woman might spend time together in public: <i>They're dating!</i> For the record, the tabloids were wrong: Sources have since clarified that Pitt and Shawkat are just friends. (Translation for our younger readers: They like each other, but they don't <i>like</i>-like each other.)

        <b>Mark Ruffalo says he doesn't know if he'll ever play the Hulk again</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here's news that might ruffle some feathers: Mark Ruffalo — who has appeared as Bruce Banner, a.k.a. the Incredible Hulk, in seven different Marvel movies — may have worn his last pair of shockingly stretchy pants. In a recent interview, Ruffalo said he asked Hollywood executives if there would be room for the Hulk in the Marvel movies after <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, and was given an extremely noncommittal answer about seeing where things landed in the future. "I just took that as a really nice way of saying 'probably not,'" Ruffalo says — which was a wise approach, because you wouldn't like him when he's angry.

        <b>Helena Bonham Carter used Daniel Radcliffe as a drink cart on the <i>Harry Potter</i> set</b>
      </p>
      <p>Daniel Radcliffe: Boy wizard, adolescent multimillionaire, surprisingly well-adjusted human adult, and… walking drink cart? That's the story told by his <i>Harry Potter</i> costar Helena Bonham Carter, who described Radcliffe as a boy who was so well-mannered that he routinely agreed to hold her beverages on set. "He was really handy because I like my tea and my coffee and my Diet Coke and things and he'd hold them all for me," explained Carter. (We guess Hogwarts saves the <i>holdus yourown beverageus</i> spell for graduate-level witches and wizards.)

        <b>There's a mysterious <i>Star Wars</i> movie on deck for 2022</b>
      </p>
      <p>After <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> hits theaters next month, the future of <i>Star Wars</i> is surprisingly uncertain (though based on the collective swoon of the internet, it's probably safe to assume it includes more Baby Yoda). While we still don't know what form it will take, it does sound like there's <i>some</i> kind of <i>Star Wars</i> movie on the horizon. The new movie — which is separate from a rumored project by <i>The Last Jedi</i> director Rian Johnson — is reportedly slated for release in 2022, and could be announced as soon as January 2020. While no further details have emerged yet, it <i>has</i> been a while since we've seen Jar Jar Binks… [<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-uncertainty-extends-kathleen-kennedys-disney-future-1256357"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>]</p>
