      <p>STATE COLLEGE, Penn. – Scientists at Penn State University have <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/598131/2019/11/18/research/new-slippery-toilet-coating-provides-cleaner-flushing-saves-water">have developed a method</a> that could not only reduce the amount of water needed to flush a toilet – but also clean it.</p>
      <p>Researchers say it takes a lot of water to get rid of the bulk of our waste. So, they created a product called "LESS" coating to help save water.</p>
      <p>It's a two-step process. First, a spray is applied to create a smooth liquid-repellent foundation. Then, a second coating makes the surface extra slippery.</p>
      <p>Researchers say the coating could last for about 500 flushes.</p>
      <p>The team says the system could reduce water consumption by 90%.</p>
      <p>They also say the surface repels bacteria.</p>
