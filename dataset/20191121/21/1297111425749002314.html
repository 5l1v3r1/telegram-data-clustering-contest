      <p>A 14-year-old boy from Wadena is now charged in connection with two coffee-throwing attacks that happened in east Regina during the summer.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/regina-police-investigating-after-coffee-thrown-at-two-men/wcm/346affb1-ad7f-4adc-8d5f-a6eb691232c5">Video of the attacks began circulating on Facebook at the time, which lead to a police investigation.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The attacks happened on July 30 in a parking lot near the stores Walmart and Winners. Falgun Vaviya, a university student from India who works at the Walmart, was sitting outside on a bench when a group of young men approached him just before 9 p.m. and threw coffee in his face. </p>
      <p>In the widely-distributed video, one of the boys says “excuse me” and when Vaviya looks up, the coffee is splashed on him.</p>
      <p>The coffee was not hot, but the incident was still shocking for the 19-year-old Vaviya.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the first attack, a 54-year-old man also had coffee thrown at him. Police said this attack happened at a nearby shopping center parking lot.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Regina police issued a release stating members of the Wadena RCMP detachment located and charged a 14-year-old boy with two counts of assault with a weapon.</p>
      <p>The teen is scheduled to appear in Provincial Youth Court in Regina on Dec. 5. The youth cannot be named in accordance with provisions under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.</p>
      <p>Wadena is located approximately 207 kilometres northeast of Regina.</p>
