      <h3>WWE Survivor Series 2019</h3>
      <p>A few weeks ago on SmackDown, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/daniel-bryan">Daniel Bryan</a> became the latest victim of The Fiend while he and Sami Zayn were in the backstage area. The following week, Bryan was a guest on the Miz TV and once again, he got interrupted by Bray Wyatt and his Firefly Fun House. The WWE Universal Champion made it clear that The Fiend wants to have another confrontation with Daniel Bryan and didn't even hesitate to put his title on the line for that matter.</p>
      <p>Now that the match is set for WWE Survivor Series, is Bryan ruining his chances by summoning the WWE Universal Champion on SmackDown? We will get our answers very soon.</p>
