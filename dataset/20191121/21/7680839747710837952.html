      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump’s</a> presidency has been upended by an explosive whistleblower complaint that has snowballed into a fast-moving impeachment inquiry, ensnaring dozens of people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and posing the most immediate threat to Trump’s presidency yet.</p>
      <p><b>What is impeachment?</b> Impeachment doesn’t mean automatic removal from office. The impeachment process can be thought of as somewhat analogous to a criminal proceeding, even though impeachable offenses don’t have to be criminal offenses. The House, like a grand jury, collects evidence, hears testimony, and drafts articles of impeachment – or charges – against the president.</p>
      <p>If a majority of the House votes to charge the president, the Senate holds a trial where both sides present their cases and senators act as jurors. If two-thirds of senators vote to convict the president on the charges brought by the House, the president is removed from office.</p>
      <p><b>How did we get here? And what could happen next?</b> We hope this guide will help answer these questions. We highly recommend you read the entirety of this story so you can be as informed as possible, but you can also jump to a specific section from the table of contents below.</p>

      <p>In early September, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/read-declassified-whistleblower-complaint-ukraine-trump-zelensky-2019-9">an anonymous whistleblower complaint</a> lodged by a member of the intelligence community said that in a series of events culminating in a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump used “the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”</p>
      <p>The complaint <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/read-declassified-whistleblower-complaint-ukraine-trump-zelensky-2019-9">detailed concerns</a> that Trump, days after <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-ukraine-military-aid-phone-call-2019-9">withholding a nearly $400 million military-aid package</a>, used the call with Zelensky to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">former Vice President Joe Biden</a> and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Hunter Biden served on the board of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-gas-company-burisma-holdings-joe-bidens-son-hunter-explained-2019-9">Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil-and-gas company</a>, from 2014 to 2019. Trump and his allies have, without evidence, accused Biden of using his power as vice president to urge Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma in order to protect Hunter.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower’s complaint has been corroborated by the White House’s summary notes of the July 25 call, White House officials themselves, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-what-we-know-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-2019-11">the sworn testimony of several career diplomatic and national-security officials.</a></p>
      <p>Multiple diplomats have now testified under oath that the Trump administration explicitly conditioned lifting the hold of the military aid to Ukraine on Zelensky <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/giuliani-was-conduit-ukraine-demanded-investigations-kurt-volker-2019-11">publicly announcing investigations into Burisma</a> and a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election to benefit Hillary Clinton.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Asking a foreign government for material campaign aid is not only unprecedented from a US president, but it could even violate campaign finance laws against soliciting campaign contributions or help from foreign nationals.</p>
      <p><b>If Trump did, in fact, use military aid as a bargaining chip</b>, as many officials have testified under oath, he could also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/laws-trump-could-have-broken-ukraine-whistleblower-case-2019-9">be impeached on charges</a> of extortion, bribery, and misappropriation of taxpayer funds.</p>
      <p>Trump’s White House and administration have also refused to comply with many aspects of the inquiry and have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/state-department-blocks-gordon-sondland-from-testifying-to-congress-2019-10">attempted to block</a> multiple administration officials from testifying, meaning Trump could also face a charge of obstructing Congress.</p>
      <p>Beyond the immediate threat to Trump and those in his inner orbit, <b>the Trump-Ukraine scandal could have lasting geopolitical consequences</b> that reverberate for years to come.</p>
      <p>Ukraine is highly dependent on American military aid to defend itself from incursions from Russia. Ukraine has been engaged in a hot war with Russia, a US adversary, since 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed the peninsula of Crimea, a contested territory.</p>
      <p>In his testimony to Congress, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an expert on Eastern European affairs on the National Security Council, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-not-include-key-phrases-trump-call-ukraine-expert-2019-10">expressed concern about the military and political implications</a> of the administration withholding the aid.</p>
      <p>Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, also testified that the US withholding aid and signaling less support for Ukraine <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-taylor-on-frontlines-ukraine-war-days-before-public-testimony-2019-11">could further embolden Russia</a> to take more aggressive military action and contribute to further destabilization of the region.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>The possible outcomes</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/61ae88edf668820de0fae357f28112e00b200831-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.sourceTom Brenner/Reuters</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>On October 31, the House <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/house-democrats-file-impeachment-inquiry-resolution-thrawt-gop-claims-2019-10">voted to approve a formal resolution</a> detailing <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/house-democrats-file-impeachment-inquiry-resolution-thrawt-gop-claims-2019-10">the terms and parameters of its inquiry</a>. But it is still in the fact-finding stage, hearing witness testimony and reviewing documents related to the inquiry.</p>
      <p>The inquiry is being jointly pursued by the House Intelligence Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.</p>
      <p><b>The impeachment process traditionally begins</b> in the House Judiciary Committee, which draws up articles of impeachment based on the results of the inquiry.</p>
      <p>The House hasn’t determined whether it would limit the scope of the inquiry to the allegations raised in the whistleblower complaint and corroborated by administration officials, or whether it would include articles related to obstruction of congressional investigations.</p>
      <p><b>If the committee passes articles of impeachment</b>, they go to the full floor of the House and require a simple majority vote of 218 members to pass. Members vote on each article individually, meaning Trump could be impeached on some articles but not others.</p>
      <p>Former President Bill Clinton, for example, was impeached on articles of perjury and obstruction of justice, but he was cleared on a separate perjury-related article and a charge of abusing his office. In January 1999, the Senate acquitted Clinton on both charges.</p>
      <p><b>For Trump to be removed from office</b>, two-thirds of the US Senate – 67 members – must vote to convict him of articles of impeachment. Currently, the Senate consists of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and two independents who caucus with Democrats.</p>
      <p><b>If Trump is not impeached, or impeached but not convicted in the Senate</b>, he stays in office, and it’ll be left up to the American people to reelect him or vote him out of office in 2020.</p>
