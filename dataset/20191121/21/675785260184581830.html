      <p>The Radio 1 presenter and former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> star revealed that she'd changed her life after reaching 12 and a half stone in 2017.</p>
      <p>Adele, who is in a relationship with Kate Holderness, says one day she "woke the f**k up" and dropped the weight by giving up sugar.</p>
      <p>The reality star swapped chocolate bars for protein bars and exchanged her usual white baps for sourdough bread.</p>
      <p>Just over a year ago, Adele took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to share an old snap of herself, when she was bigger, and opened up about her weight loss journey.</p>

      <p>In the old picture, Adele is sitting down to enjoy an afternoon tea of cakes, sandwiches and other tasty treats.</p>
      <p>Her face is visibly fuller and she looks very different to the way she does today.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Hi everybody! Past Adele just wanted to wish you a very happy #throwbackthursday</p>
      <p>"I’ve just told her she’s going to run two marathons in the future. She’s just p****d herself laughing and gone straight to the bottom shelf on that cake stand.</p>

      <p>"It’s never too late to change Going to take her back to this very spot one day and recreate this photo. Just need to find that bloody t-shirt. It was my favourite. Wore it for Kate’s birthday. Thought I was being dead fancy because it’s got Nike in gold on it</p>
      <p>"Currently telling the story of how this little cherub went from cake stands to WAKING THE F*CK UP"</p>
      <p>Her followers were blown away.</p>
      <p>One said: "what a transformation. Never mind the t shirt, I'm more bothered about the cardy buttoned up"</p>
      <p>Another told her: "you’re an inspiration."</p>

      <p>Adele also took part in the10-year challenge, sharing side by side images of her now and a decade ago, when she looked dramatically different.</p>
      <p>The star is currently living in the jungle, so after a few weeks of living on rations of rice and beans, unless the camp wins some stars, she could end up looking even more different to her before picture.</p>
      <p>* I'm A Celebrity airs nightly at 9pm on ITV</p>
