      <h2>Women’s Aid research found Irish females are more likely to be killed at the hands of a man they know</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:49:34+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">Aoife Moore, William DunneDigital Journalist</a></address>
      <p>Four out of five women killed violently this year died in their own home, a report has revealed.</p>
      <p>Women’s Aid research found Irish females are more likely to be killed at the hands of a man they know.</p>
      <p>The Femicide Watch 2019 report confirmed 230 women have been killed and 16 children have died alongside their mothers since 1996.</p>
      <p>Disturbingly, almost nine in 10 of them were victims of a man they knew (87%).</p>
      <p>In the 20 cases where a woman was killed by a male relative, <br/>16 of the perpetators were their sons.</p>
      <p>Figures show 56% of the victims were killed by a current or former boyfriend, husband or partner, while strangers make up 13% of perpetrators of female homicide in Ireland.</p>

      <p>Women’s Aid chief Sarah Benson said: “Since our records began in 1996, 230 women have died violently in Ireland.</p>
      <p>“Sixteen children, ranging from five months to 14 years, have died alongside their mothers. A hundred women have died at the hands of their current or former partners. These figures should shame Irish society.</p>
      <p>“The lives of the women and children named in our report were so valuable, so full of potential which is now unrealised.</p>
      <p>“We want each of them to be remembered for their achievements, their qualities, their hopes and dreams.”</p>
      <p>Ms Benson added the killing of women fits a global pattern and is in stark contrast to male homicide victims, the majority of whom are killed by strangers.</p>
      <p>She said: “One key initiative that could help immediately is the introduction of a system of Domestic Homicide Reviews.</p>
      <p>“These reviews should be independently chaired, have powers to make and monitor recommendations to improve prevention.</p>
      <p>“We know from other jurisdictions DHRs are a very important tool for families and loved ones to have their voices heard after often feeling let down by or voiceless in the Criminal Justice System or in the aftermath of a case of murder.”</p>
