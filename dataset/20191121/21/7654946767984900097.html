      <h1>Celeb lawyer Joe Tacopina’s ex-office manager admits to $2M embezzlement</h1>

      <p>High-profile attorney Joe Tacopina’s former office manager pleaded guilty Thursday to embezzling nearly $2 million from his firm.</p>
      <p>Jane Anderson, 36, copped to one count of first-degree grand larceny in Manhattan Supreme Court in exchange for 2 1/2 to 7 1/2 years in prison.</p>
      <p>She admitted that she stole $1,765,536.83 from the Law Offices of Tacopina &amp; Seigel, where she worked for about four years.</p>
      <p>A judgment in that amount will be entered against her when she’s sentenced Jan. 2.</p>
      <p>“Despite her mistake, Ms. Anderson is a kind and caring young woman who proactively cooperated with law enforcement prior to her arrest,” said her defense lawyer, Jeremy Saland. “She is eager to move her life constructively forward and hopes all parties can do the same.”</p>
      <p>The ex-staffer wrote herself five unauthorized checks and sent herself 11 wire transfers from the law firm’s business accounts between July 2018 and February 2019, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
      <p>Tacopina called cops when he got wind of the thefts, and Anderson <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/20/joe-tacopinas-office-manager-surrenders-on-embezzlement-charges/">turned herself in last March</a>. She has been held on $250,000 bail since her arrest.</p>
      <p>The high-powered lawyer has repped a lengthy list of celebrity clients, including Michael Jackson, former Yankee Alex Rodriguez, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2017/08/18/meek-mill-was-popping-wheelies-for-music-vid-shoot-lawyer/?_ga=2.131022863.1464455777.1572802399-2.48664742.1454538387.1559579114-2.51172137.1454538387.1559579114-2.41810978.1454538387.1559579114-2.220650904.1454538387.1559579114-2.115864582.1454538387.1559579114-868845599.1516889872">rapper Meek Mill</a> and actress Taryn Manning.</p>
