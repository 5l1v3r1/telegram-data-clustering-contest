      <p>The cool breeze, the twinkling lights, the hustle and bustle of buying gifts. Yes, Christmas is near and the spirit of  Noche Buena is on full blast with thoughts of creating the most perfect of memories from giving the perfect gift to serving the best during the season of love and joy.</p>

      <p>For actress Dimples Romana, the new brand Ambassador for CDO Premium Holiday Ham, Noche Buena and ham come hand-in-hand when it comes to creating memories during Christmas festivities.  </p>
      <p>“Christmas will not be complete if there’s no CDO Premium Holiday Ham on the table.  Yung salo-salo na sama- sama kayo, magdarasal kayo, kakain kayo, parang parte na rin talaga  to have that ham there.”</p>
      <p>It’s a tradition she grew up with and something that she continues on as a wife and mother of two. If you check her social media posts, you will know that her whole family, the Romanas and the Ahmees, always celebrate together at home during Noche Buena.  </p>
      <p>“We make it a point that no matter how busy we are, we need to make time (to be together),” she shares. In fact, they make sure they have a theme for the year, “Minsan Pinoy, minsan Spanish, pero ang hindi nababago, yung  CDO Premium Holiday Ham. Favorite  siya  no matter what theme we do for Christmas.”</p>
      <p>More than just a celebrity endorser, Dimples is very choosy about what she gives her family. The delicious smoky flavor with pineapple sweetness of CDO Premium Holiday Ham fits her choice because it is made from tender pork pigue, the finest cut in making a ham, and has absolutely no extenders. Plus, it is guaranteed ASF-safe as it is pork that was carefully sourced from credible suppliers.</p>
      <p>As someone who knows her way around the kitchen, Dimples is excited by how her favorite ham has leveled up the pineapple flavor by adding even more pineapple glaze.  </p>
      <p>“You don’t need to bother boiling the ham in pineapple juice as it has already been cooked in the sweet indulgence of pineapple,” she shares.</p>
      <p>Recognized recently as one of the best by the Asian Academy Creative Awards for her role as Daniela in  Kadenang Ginto, what got Dimples most excited about shooting for the brand’s commercial was not about acting.  </p>
      <p>“Siyempre, ang pinakaunang tinanong ko, meron po bang ham sa  TVC shoot?  Ha ha ha! Naghanap talaga ‘ko,” she says in jest.</p>
      <p>A certified foodie, Dimples confesses. “Hindi ko alam if it’s the Kapampangan in me,  bukod sa masarap akong magluto, masarap din akong kumain.  Iba kasi kapag ine-enjoy  mo talaga.  It shows how passionate you are about things. Not only for food but for life. Alam mong ine-enjoy  mo ang buhay mo at kumakain ka ng gusto mong kainin at nasi-share  mo sa pamilya mo.”</p>
      <p>That’s Dimples Romana for you. A premiere actress who only wants the best for her career and her family. As the new face for CDO Premium Holiday Ham, she sums up what makes it a stand-out favorite and levels up the Noche Buena table. It’s a quality product that was created from the heart by CDO Foodsphere, Inc. to be shared with family and loved ones. A quality that is simply the best.</p>
