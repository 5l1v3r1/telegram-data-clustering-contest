      <p>Cape Town - <b>Pakistan </b>batsman <b>Asad Shafiq</b> admitted that they did not get total they wanted but was satisfied with the fight showed by his team on the first day of the first Test against <b>Australia </b>in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>The visitors were bowled out for 240 in the final session at the Gabba with Shafiq top-scoring with 76 while left-arm quick Mitchell Starc claimed figures of 4-52.</p>
      <p>It could have been much worse for Pakistan as they were labouring at 143-6 but Shafiq and tail-ender Yasir Shah (26) added 84 runs for the seventh wicket to get the tourists to a respectable total.</p>
      <p>After the day's play, Shafiq said the stand with Yasir was important and is also confident that their own pace attack will pose problems to the Australia batting unit.</p>
      <p>Shafiq told reporters: "There was a partnership needed, with wickets falling very quickly.</p>
      <p>"I was trying to build that partnership and I knew a good partnership could help the team.</p>
      <p>"We didn't reach the total we wanted but still we got a respectable total.</p>
      <p>"With the bowling unit that we have got, we still show that we have some very good fight."</p>
      <p>Pakistan's pace bowling attack includes 16-year-old Naseem Shah, who is making his debut at international level after just seven first-class appearances.</p>
