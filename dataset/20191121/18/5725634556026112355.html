      <h3>Company Overview</h3>
      <p><b>Six Flags Entertainment (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIX">SIX</a>)</b> is based outside of Dallas and operates regional theme and water parks under the Six Flags name. The company owns and operates 25 parks, including 22 parks in the United States, 2 parks in Mexico, and 1 park in Montreal, Canada. The stock has a market capitalization of just north of $4 billion.</p>
      <h3>Insider Buying</h3>
      <p>Three insiders purchased nearly $900,000 of new shares in aggregate over the past two weeks, led by the CEO's $500K buy on November 18th. This is the first insider buys in the stock since March of this year. It should be <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3510097-six-flags-names-new-boss">noted</a> the CEO just took the job and came over from PepsiCo (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP">PEP</a>) and has significant experience managing overseas operations. This should be helpful given the company is focused on international expansion, establishing partnerships and building new theme parks around the world.</p>
      <h3>Recent News &amp; Analyst Activity</h3>
      <p>In late October, several analyst firms including B. Riley FBR and SunTrust Robinson modestly <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3509233-sell-side-chips-away-six-flags-price-targets">lowered</a> their price targets on Six Flags after the company posted disappointing <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3508064-six-flags-eps-misses-0_20-misses-revenue">Q3 results</a> that showed just a slight year-over-year bump in revenue growth. There also have been some rumors that Six Flags and competitor <b>Cedar Fair (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FUN">FUN</a>)</b> may end up <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3508381-six-flags-ceo-says-big-deal-talks-ongoing">combining</a> in some sort of acquisition. Cedar Fair <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3504029-cedar-fair-turns-away-six-flags">turned away</a> from a $70 a share bid in October.</p>
      <h3>Valuation</h3>
      <p>The stock sells at just under 18 times earnings and should show revenue growth this year in the low single digits. Not cheap. However, in light of a seven percent plus dividend yield not outlandish either. The dividend payout got a minor <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3520058-six-flags-declares-0_83-dividend">bump</a> recently. The business also has a nice moat as it is expensive to build new theme parks and it takes time to do, which is why there are few competitors in the space.</p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>A solid jobs market, strong wage growth and positive consumer sentiment should continue to be a nice tailwind for this space. New leadership should also hopefully drive more shareholder value in this name as well. At these trading levels, I view Six Flags as primarily a dividend play and it is encouraging to see insider buying in the equity. I have taken a small stake in the stock this week using some buy-write orders to enhance my income return from the calls. I outline that option strategy below.</p>
      <h3>Option Strategy</h3>

      <p>I believe SIX is a good candidate for a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-write.asp">buy-write</a> or covered call strategy, thanks to its dividend and what seems like limited downside. I also don't think the name is a "home run" stock, so I am perfectly content to try for an easy single on this one. Using the June $47.50 call strikes fashion a Buy-Write order with a net debit in the $43.10 to $43.20 range (net stock price - option premium). Liquidity is solid in this name, so the orders should fill quickly. At $45.75 a share, this should provide a $2.65 to $2.75 a share call premium, two dividend payouts of 83 cents a piece, and $1.75 a share of potential and likely capital appreciation.</p>
