      <h1>Now Twitter users can enable two-factor without linking a phone number</h1>
      <h2>Extra security without reduced privacy.</h2>

      <p>Twitter has finally made a change users have been waiting a long time to see. No, it's not editable tweets, but as of today everyone can enable two-factor authentication on their account without linking a phone number.</p>
      <p>While SMS-based two-factor can be a fallback for people who lose access to code-generating devices or don't have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/26/twitter-adds-support-login-verification-usb-key/">security keys</a>, it's very vulnerable to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/10/hacker-hijacks-deray-by-redirecting-his-verizon-phone-number/">SIM-swapping attacks</a>. Twitter added code generator support a while ago, but still asked users to add a phone number if they wanted the extra verification and you couldn't remove the fallback. That's upsetting for those concerned about their privacy, they may not want to link a phone number to their account at all, and Twitter has already admitted that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/08/twitter-phone-numbers-possibly-used-for-ad-targeting/">it used phone-numbers to target ads</a> even for users who declined that.</p>
      <p>Attackers used SIM-swapping to send tweets from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's account earlier this year, and while the exploit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/04/twitter-disables-tweeting-via-sms/">didn't use two-factor codes</a>, it showed how vulnerable the SMS-based system can be. If you already have a phone number linked in your profile, then you can go ahead and remove it now. However, a security engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/jcmi/status/1197649884645511168">noted</a> that you can't remove the number and rely simply on a security key for access since that's only supported on the website.</p>
