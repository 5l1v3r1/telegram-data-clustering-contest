      <p>Glastonbury co-organizer Emily Eavis said the former Beatle would headline the Pyramid Stage on June 27—the traditional highlight of the event in Somerset, south-west England.</p>
      <p>“Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid next year is an absolute dream come true,” she said in a statement on the festival website on Monday.</p>
      <p>“There really was no one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary.”</p>
      <p>McCartney previously headlined Glastonbury in 2004. This year’s headliner was grime star  Stormzy.</p>
      <p>He dropped hints on his Twitter feed before the announcement by posting photographs of the composer Philip Glass, actress Emma Stone and the musician Chuck Berry—Glass-Stone-Berry.</p>
      <p>All 135,000 tickets for the 50th anniversary festival went on sale last month and sold out in 34 minutes, organizers said. </p>
