      <h1>We just want financial and employment security say Ireland's 20-year-olds</h1>

      <p>Financial and employment security is highest on the list of what 20-year-olds in Ireland are hoping for in the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>Nearly three quarters of 20-year-olds surveyed as part of the Growing Up in Ireland study said they'd value a secure, well-paid job.</p>
      <p>That's compared to just under a third who said a long-term relationship was of high importance to them.</p>
      <p>ESRI researcher Dorothy Watson says most are still reliant on the parents to help them out financially.</p>
      <p>"Most of them are not out there working and earning yet ... The parents are taking care of their basic living expenses for the most part."</p>
