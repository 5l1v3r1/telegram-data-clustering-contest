      <h1>Duet Air update brings ability to use a Mac or PC as an external display</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:00:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.duetdisplay.com/air">Duet Air</a> is getting a nice update that allows customers to make use of a Mac or PC as a secondary external display. This offers great flexibility, especially for users in both ecosystems.</p>
      <p>Duet launched the new functionality with the release of <a href="https://www.duetdisplay.com/air">Duet Air 2.0</a>. With less than 30ms latency and 256-bit encryption, the latest software from the company offers a fast, secure, and flexible way to expand your digital workspace beyond just an iPad as an external display.</p>
      <p>This means you can use a Mac or a PC as the source computer with either one becoming an external display. It also solves the problem of Apple’s 5K iMacs not supporting Target Display Mode.</p>
      <p>Duet also highlights that it runs all via software, so no hardware purchase is needed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Duet Air 2.0 highlights:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>    •  Turn your Mac or PC into a wireless second or mirrored display<br/>    •  Enable your iOS device, Mac or PC to remote desktop (RDP) into your other devices from anywhere in the world<br/>    •  All with minimal latency<br/>    •  Android support coming in January 2020</blockquote>
      <p>Duet Air 2.0 is available now for Mac and PC direct from the company, starting from $2/month or $20/year. And you can find <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duet-display/id935754064">Duet Display for iPhone and iPad on the App Store</a>.</p>
      <p>Last month <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/17/luna-display-mac-to-mac-mode/">Luna introduced Mac to Mac functionality</a> but there isn’t PC support at the time of writing. Luna also works via a small hardware dongle.</p>
      <p>Both Duet and Luna have been under more pressure since Apple released its <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/sidecar/">Sidecar feature</a> with macOS Catalina and iPadOS 13 that turns an iPad into a secondary Mac display.</p>
