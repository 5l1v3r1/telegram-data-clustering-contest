      <h1>US has the upper hand in US-China trade war, but ... - Hu Xijin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:52:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ross-j-burland" target="_blank">Ross J Burland</a></address>
      <p>The Global Times Chief in Editor, Hu Xijin, has crossed the wires via Twitter with the following statement:</p>
      <blockquote>"The US has the upper hand in US-China trade war, which allows it to decide when to end the trade war, but far from enough for it to decide how to end the trade war. The US side wants both, then it needs to change an adversary."</blockquote>
      <h3>FX implications:</h3>
      <p>Hu Xijin came to fame during the onset of the trade wars between China and the US, an outspoken commentator on the matter from which markets have tuned into for guidance as to what the latest mood is from the Chinese officials involved in brokering a deal between Washington and Beijing. His comments have at times, moved the markets – On this occasion, failing to do so –  "It’s fair to say that some signs of trade-headline fatigue are emerging in markets," analysts at ANZ Bank argued when commenting over previous online publications related to trade wars from which markets took little impetus from, less so than usual. </p>
