        <li>Across the world, hotels have been left to rot.</li>
        <li>They were forced to shutter for reasons including a drop in the number of visitors, an end to funding, and political turmoil.</li>
        <li>Restoration efforts are being made to return some of these hotels to their former glory, including The Baker Hotel in Mineral Wells, Texas, which once welcomed Lyndon B. Johnson as a guest.</li>

      <p>Rotting, crumbling, or completely taken over by nature, <a href="http://www.insider.com/abandoned-buildings-from-around-the-world-2017-9">abandoned buildings</a> can be as creepy as they are fascinating – and hotels are no exception.</p>
      <p>From once-thriving beach resorts to former celebrity hotspots, we’ve rounded up 20 of the coolest abandoned hotels from around the world, as well as the history behind them.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Located in Amboy, California, a ghost town on the historic Route 66, Roy’s Motel Cafe has been featured in various movies, including “The Hitcher” and “Southbound.”</p>
      <p>Roy’s opened in 1938 and employed <a href="https://www.rt66roys.com/">over 70 staff members</a> in its heyday, but fell into disrepair when Interstate 40 opened up in 1972, effectively <a href="http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gtusa/usa/ca/amboy.htm">bypassing Amboy completely.</a></p>
      <p>Although the coffee shop and gas station were reopened in 2008, the motel remains closed.</p>

      <h3>Haludovo Palace Hotel, Krk, Croatia</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/photos-haludovo-palace-hotel-abandoned-croatia">The Haludovo Palace Hotel</a> was once a luxurious vacation destination on the beautiful Croatian island of Krk.</p>
      <p>The hotel became even more lavish when the <a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-haludovo-palace-hotel">founder of Penthouse Magazine</a>, Bob Guccione, invested $45 million in the property and renamed it the Penthouse Adriatic Club Casino.</p>
      <p>However, after the Yugoslav Wars began in the early 1990s, tourism in Krk came to a drastic halt. Today, many beautiful beachfront properties still remain empty, including this former resort.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Ryugyong Hotel, Pyongyang, North Korea</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/577bfbc50aec9516008b56f2.png"/>
        <figcaption>The Ryugyong Hotel is the tallest unoccupied building in the world.<cite>Ho New/Reuters</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>With 105 floors and a unique, triangular shape, <a href="https://www.insider.com/abandoned-hotel-north-korea-ryugyong-photos-2019-11">the Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang</a> towers over much of the city.</p>
      <p>Construction on the building began in 1989 with plans of containing lounges, casinos, and night clubs. However, the hotel has remained unfinished for decades.</p>
      <p>There have been new signs of construction progress. Alek Sigley, an Australian student studying in North Korea, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlekSigley/status/1143087171965898752">tweeted about new signage above the main entrance of the hotel</a> in June 2019.</p>

      <h3>Polissya Hotel, Pripyat, Ukraine</h3>

        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/59e9102d49e1cf7c038b4719.png"/>
        <figcaption>Pripyat was evacuated during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986.<cite>Shutterstock / Milosz Maslanka</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>On April 26, 1986, a radioactive release <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/readings/chernobyl.html">10 times bigger</a> than the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. Around 350,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes, leaving in such a haste that the city looks like it’s frozen in time.</p>
      <p>Dolls are scattered on the floors of abandoned kindergartens; shreds of sheets and pillows remain on beds; and dishes rot in sinks. Radiation levels in the city are still <a href="http://chernobylgallery.com/chernobyl-disaster/radiation-levels/">too high</a> for people to live there, so it remains untouched.</p>
      <p>The Polissya Hotel is one of the tallest buildings in the abandoned city, and is even featured in the video game <a href="https://atomicallyspeaking.com/nuclear-sites/pripyat/polissya-hotel-pripyat/">“Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.”</a></p>

      <h3>Hotel Belvedere, Dubrovnik, Croatia</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Once a five-star luxury resort, the Hotel Belvedere was destroyed during the Siege of Dubrovnik during the War of Independence in 1991, and has remained abandoned ever since.</p>
      <p>One of the hotel’s decks was recently used as a set for “Game of Thrones,” more specifically, as the site of the battle between Prince Oberyn and The Mountain in the fourth season.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, local media reported the hotel was <a href="https://www.total-croatia-news.com/business/33689-dubrovnik">to be replaced by a newer one</a>.</p>

      <h3>Lee Plaza Hotel, Detroit, Michigan</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Built in 1927, the 15-story Lee Plaza Hotel was abandoned in 1993, after a stint serving low-income seniors.</p>
      <p>The art-deco hotel faced major financial and legal woes, especially during the Great Depression, and saw many different owners.</p>

      <h3>Hotels in Varosha, Famagusta, Cyprus</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.my/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Varosha, a town on the island of Cyprus, was once popular among tourists, though the entire beachside community is abandoned today. Elizabeth Taylor and Brigitte Bardot both visited Varosha back in its prime, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2689220/From-coast-town-ghost-town-Eerie-images-derelict-houses-hotels-planes-Nicosia-divided-capital-city-world-Turkey-invaded-Cyprus-40-years-ago.html">according to the Daily Mail</a>. However, in 1974, a Turkish invasion and occupation of the island took place. While a United Nations buffer zone kept them at bay, <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/varosha">keeping them around</a> <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/varosha">two miles from the resort city</a>, hotels and businesses lost their customers and became vacant.</p>
      <p>Today, many beachfront hotels still stand, overlooking the ocean, although they remain eerily empty.</p>

      <h3>Grand Hotel Kupari, Kupari, Croatia</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>A stone’s throw away from Dubrovnik, Grand Hotel Kupari was a former <a href="http://www.thedubrovniktimes.com/lifestyle/feature/item/336-kupari-a-resort-still-in-ruins">military resort</a> built for the elite of the then Yugoslav army and their families. Soon, four more hotels were constructed around it.</p>
      <p>Although the other hotels have since been demolished and will soon be replaced by a five-star Marriott, the Grand Hotel remains, protected as a historical building.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Baker Hotel, Mineral Wells, Texas</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The abandoned Baker Hotel, which opened in 1929, was <a href="http://www.thebakerhotel.com/history.html">the first</a><a href="http://www.thebakerhotel.com/history.html"> skyscraper built outside of a major metropolitan area.</a> It also had newfangled 5-star amenities like the first Olympic size hotel swimming pool, air conditioning, and automatic light controls.</p>
      <p>All this attracted <a href="http://www.thebakerhotel.com/history.html">legendary guests</a> such as Lyndon Johnson, Judy Garland, the Three Stooges, and even American criminals Bonnie and Clyde.</p>
      <p>Although the hotel continued to thrive throughout the Great Depression, its doors closed in 1972.</p>
      <p>In 2019, it was reported that developers <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/baker-hotel-mineral-wells-restoration/">were embarking on a three-year restoration project</a>. It is expected to open in 2022.</p>

      <h3>Rum Orphanage, Büyükada, Istanbul, Turkey</h3>

        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/59b84265e517bd35008b46a2.png"/>
        <figcaption>Despite being made of wood, Rum Orphanage in Turkey still stands today.<cite><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/buyukada-greek-orphanage-116221771?src=duhrFFXEoLPc5LPGAalbvw-1-1">Official/Shutterstock</a></cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This large wooden building on Büyükada, off the coast of Turkey, was originally designed to be a luxury hotel and casino. Due to issues with permits, however, the building was sold and eventually turned into an orphanage in the early 20th century.</p>
      <p>The approximately 215,000 square foot building is reportedly the largest historic timber building in Europe, according to <a href="https://www.wmf.org/project/rum-orphanage">the World Monuments Fund.</a></p>
      <p>After failing as a hotel and ending operations as an orphanage in 1964, the building remained unoccupied for decades. In 2012, restoration began to turn the site into an environmental institute.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Closed since 1975, Hotel Ponce Intercontinental, nicknamed simply “El Ponce,” was once a glamorous, <a href="https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/eco-tourism/stories/8-eerie-abandoned-hotels">170-room beach resort</a> on top of El Vigia Hill, overlooking the south coast of Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>Due to financial troubles, the once chic hotel has been empty for over 40 years. The building won’t remain abandoned for much longer, though, as plans were recently approved for it to be converted into <a href="https://www.elnuevodia.com/estilosdevida/hogar/nota/premianplanpararestaurarlaestructuradelponceintercontinental-2217281/">a housing complex</a> for homeless youth that is part of the LGBTQ community.</p>

      <p><a href="http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/abandoned_ny_grossingers_catskill.php#photo-1">Grossinger’s Catskill Resort</a> in Liberty, New York, was abandoned in the 1980s. The hotel first opened in the early 1900s, although it really took off in the 1950s. In its heyday, the resort had a swimming pool, golf course, ski slope, and theater, offering amenities for every season.</p>
      <p>However, after the resort’s owner died in 1972 and the property was sold to a hotel developer, plans to renovate Grossinger’s fell through and the resort fell into disrepair. It became a sought-out location for urban explorers.</p>
      <p>In 2018, buildings at the resort were demolished.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This abandoned beach resort is said to have ties to the mafia, and is also believed to be cursed.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;amp;objectid=11621620">The hotel dates back to a 1987</a> deal between the Cook Islands Government and an Italian bank, and was meant to become a Sheraton. However, an angry local claimed that the land was his, and cursed it. The hotel was never finished, and the remaining structures are now dilapidated and graffiti-ridden.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This ship-shaped building used to serve as a luxurious place for travelers to spend the night near the train station.</p>
      <p>Built <a href="http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/inventaire/itiinv/archixx/pann/p39.htm">between 1928 and 1932</a>, the hotel had a ballroom, theater, and rooftop tennis court with a sprawling view of the ocean.</p>
      <p>During the outbreak of the war in Spain, however, the borders were closed, and traffic to and from the train station declined. The hotel was soon left abandoned.</p>
      <p>In 1987, the building became protected as a historic monument, and is now in part rental apartments.</p>

      <p>It was also featured in several Vegas-based movies including “Casino,” “Oceans 11,” and “The Hangover.”</p>
      <p>The building closed in 2015 due to financial troubles, and was left abandoned until it was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watch-implosion-of-last-tower-of-famed-riviera-hotel-and-casino-in-vegas/">imploded in 2016</a>.</p>

      <p>Located in the “<a href="http://fox8.com/2017/02/13/honeymoon-is-over-photographer-shares-heartbreaking-look-at-abandoned-poconos-resorts/">honeymoon capital of the world</a>,” this abandoned hotel used to be a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/penn-hills-resort">romantic getaway hotspot</a> in the Poconos that included two wedding bell-shaped swimming pools and guest villas that featured heart-shaped Jacuzzis and round beds.</p>
      <p>Having been abandoned since 2009, the resort <a href="http://wnep.com/2017/09/04/former-honeymoon-resort-catches-fire-in-monroe-county/">went up in flames in 2017,</a> and the main building burned to the ground.</p>

      <p>In 2000, the Buck Hill Inn was used as a location for MTV’s show “Fear,” which claimed that the hotel was the site of 73 murders, the suicide of one maid, and ghost sightings.</p>
      <p>The hotel was <a href="http://wnep.com/2017/01/19/buck-hill-inn-demolition-underway/">demolished in 2017.</a></p>
