      <p>The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, was referred to a select committee of the Upper House on Tuesday, after several MPs raised concerns over several provisions of the legislation, including making it mandatory for a surrogate to be a close relative.</p>
      <p>The Bill, passed by the Lok Sabha in the previous session, was moved by Health Minister Harsh Vardhan. He said in the absence of regulations, India had emerged as a hub of commercial surrogacy for couples from abroad. He had urged the House to pass the Bill, saying it had been sent to a Standing Committee.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, however, the Minister moved a motion for the Bill to be sent to a select committee, which had been a demand of Opposition parties during the discussion on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
