      <p>For the first time in <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> history, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a> will feature three brands battling it out for brand supremacy. In the last couple of weeks, we have seen RAW, SmackDown, and NXT roster invade live shows to build up for the upcoming battle.</p>
      <p>This is <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT’s</a> first-ever appearance in one of the big four PPVs in WWE and they are the favorites to pick up a dominant win on Sunday. However, that may not be the case this weekend.</p>
      <p>Despite all its talent, the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/triple-h">Triple H</a>-led NXT is competing against two names that have ruled the pro-wrestling business for years now. They might be the best brand but <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a> may be skeptical about letting the former ‘developmental’ brand belittle the entire product.</p>
      <p>In this list, we will take a look at five reasons why the WWE Boss will not allow NXT to beat RAW and SmackDown.</p>

      <h4>#5 NXT Superstars are still the ‘Underdogs’</h4>

      <p>WWE may have recognised NXT as the third brand of the promotion. However, the Black and Gold brand has a long way to go before it tastes the same success as experienced by <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/raw">RAW</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/smackdown">SmackDown</a>.</p>
      <p>Back when NXT was still the developmental brand, several Superstars ruled at Full Sail Live but ended up losing their charm upon their arrival on the main roster. The difference in the booking can be blamed for that, but the same thing might be repeated at Survivor Series.</p>
      <p>NXT will be represented by the underdogs at the upcoming PPV. A dominance in their first-ever battle for brand supremacy will indeed do wonders for the Black and Gold brand. However, going by history, Vince McMahon will not be comfortable in agreeing to that sort of booking.</p>
      <p>Despite better storylines, sensible narration and intense matches, NXT doesn’t enjoy as much popularity as its counterparts. This might be one of the biggest reasons why we may see Superstars from the Red and the Blue brand preying on the talent from NXT come Sunday night.</p>
