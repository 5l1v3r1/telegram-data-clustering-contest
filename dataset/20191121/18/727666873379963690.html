      <h1>Ambassador Sondland Told President Trump To "Play The Race Card" With A$AP Rocky</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:46:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author">AllHipHop Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Harlem rapper has unexpectedly been put into the center of a growing controversy between the Democrats and the Republicans.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>President Donald Trump wanted to milk the international crisis involving rapper A$AP Rocky as much as he possibly could.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/a-ap-rocky-freed-from-swedish-jail-rapper-rushing-back-to-the-united-states-yHtJKPOK2E-bJIpc48ENvw/">The political drama for A$AP Rocky unfolded on June 30, after he claimed he was accosted and attacked by a pair of alleged drug addicts on the streets of Stockholm, Sweden.</a>
      </p>
      <p>A$AP Rocky, born Rakim Myers, and several of his associates administered a severe beatdown to a guy named Mustafa Jafari, who pressed charges against the rapper.</p>
      <p>President Trump was discussing A$AP Rocky during an infamous call on July 25th, with U.S. European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland, when he asked about the status of a secret deal he struck.</p>
      <p>The conversation then shifted to Ambassador Sondland's efforts on behalf of the President to assist a rapper who was jailed in Sweden," David Holmes testified before congress today.</p>
      <p>"Ambassador Sondland told the president that the rapper was "kind of F##ked there" and should have pled guilty," David Holmes said and that Sweden should have released A$AP Rocky on President Trump's "word."</p>
      <p>Ambassador Sondland then recommended that President Trump should let A$AP be sentenced, "play the racism card and then give the rapper a 'ticker-tape' [parade]" when he returned home Ambassador Holmes testified.</p>
      <p>The shocking news was revealed today by Holmes, who was revealed he was within earshot of the conversation President Trump had with Sondland.</p>
      <p>Democrats say President Trump was trying to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Vice-President Joe Biden, in return for over $400 million in military aid.</p>
      <p>The comments follow the narrative President Trump actually followed when he and his wife Melania intervened on behalf of Rocky to put pressure on Sweden to release A$AP Rocky.</p>
      <p>"I personally don't know A$AP Rocky but I can tell you he has a lot of support from the African American community in this country," President Trump said in July, the same month he was scheming against Biden. "I can really say from everybody in this country because we are all one."</p>

      </p>
      <p>The rapper did not take the bait and has refused to acknowledge, or thank President Trump.</p>
