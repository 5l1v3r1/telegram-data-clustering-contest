      <h1>Currys PC World Black Friday deals: the best predictions for the 2019 sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:24:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/lela-london/" target="_blank">Lela London</a></address>
      <p>Currys PC World always goes above and beyond for<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/"> Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday. The tech-peddling retail giant almost approaches the sales event like it's a charitable cause; last year it knocked £100s off of TVs, kitchen appliances, laptops, gaming consoles and more.</p>
      <p>Adopting a somewhat precarious sales tactic for one of the industry’s most competitive days, it even price-matched most major retailers’ <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">best Black Friday deals</a>. </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it works. The store's website is known to receive over half a million visitors before 6am and that number is only expected to increase this year.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re browsing Black Friday deals for new tech or simply want to find a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/best-christmas-gift-ideas-2019-guide-top-presents-wish-list/">Christmas gift</a> cool enough to warrant a smile from your teenage cousin, Currys PC World will likely have you covered.</p>
      <h3>How to find the best deals at Currys PC World</h3>
      <p>Though we’ll be here throughout the Black Friday period to update you on the best deals available across all of Internetland, it’s worth noting that deals from Currys PC World could offer you additional benefits.</p>
      <p>Firstly, Currys, as we love to call it, has a price match promise that applies to most high street and online retailers in the space (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/argos-black-friday-deals-best-predictions-2019-sales/">Argos</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/john-lewis-black-friday-deals-best-predictions-2019-sale/">John Lewis</a>,<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/amazon-black-friday-2019-best-deals-uk-today-early-sale-offers/"> Amazon</a>, Tesco, Asda etc). The promise not only applies to price cuts but special voucher offers, as well, meaning you are unlikely to find better deals on its chosen products.</p>
      <p>To take advantage of the price cut promise, all you have to do is notify the company of a competitor’s price within seven days of purchase. Fortunately, this means Black Friday deals purchased on November 29 will be reduced if a competitor prices the same product lower through Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>Before Black Friday itself, Currys usually offers a week-long series of ‘Black Tag’ deals that offers big discounts on smaller items. It’s not likely to be the place where you find your dream TV deal, but it will likely provide handy early deals on household tech, if you want to avoid the madness on November 29th.</p>
      <p>Currys usually releases its biggest deals as the clock strikes midnight on Black Friday. The 12am start might be unusual for seasoned offline shoppers, but a quick browse before bed might guarantee you an item that would otherwise be sold out when you wake.</p>
      <p>To ramp up your savings on the day, you can use their Trade In scheme to turn your old tech into Currys gift cards. Even a third-party app, like Zeek (which allows you to buy unwanted gift cards at a discount), could contribute.</p>
      <p>Should you opt to shop in store rather than online, Currys’ Team Knowhow will provide expert product set-up and installation for you. This is especially useful for shoppers who are investing in brand-new tech for the first time.</p>
      <h3>Latest news</h3>
      <p>In the run-up to Black Friday 2019, Currys PC World launched its 'Why Wait?' sales on Wednesday, November 13, with significant savings of up to £450 available. There is even a price-match service where, if the products during the Black Friday sales, Currys will refund the difference.</p>
      <p>At present, <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/household-appliances/small-kitchen-appliances/food-and-drink-preparation/food-mixers/kitchenaid-artisan-stand-mixer-black-04235085-pdt.html">KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixers</a> have £220 off, there's a £200 discount on the <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Ftv-and-home-entertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2Flg-oled55b9pla-55-smart-4k-ultra-hd-hdr-oled-tv-with-google-assistant-10192863-pdt.html">LG 55” Smart Ultra HD TV with Google Assistant</a>, and you can save £100 on the cord-free <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fhome-appliances%2Ffloorcare%2Fvacuum-cleaners%2Fdyson-v8-absolute-cordless-bagless-vacuum-cleaner-nickel-iron-10145173-pdt.html">Dyson V8 vacuum cleaner</a>.

      <h3>Currys PC World predictions for 2019</h3>
      <p>TVs and laptops are Currys’ bread and butter. Check out The Telegraph’s respective <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-tv-deals-black-friday-2019-uk-cyber-monday-sales/">Black Friday TV </a>and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/predictions-best-laptop-deals-black-friday-cyber-monday-sales/">laptop predictions</a> to ensure you know what to look for.</p>
      <p>Games consoles are also a popular Black Friday regular for the retailer. In fact, one of the most popular deals from last year’s sale was its Xbox One S bundle, which packaged the console with Forza Horizon 4, Tekken 7 and Project Cars 2 for just £169.99 (normally £249.99) </p>
      <p>Home tech and smart home devices are also a major calling card for Currys' customers, and we expect Black Friday 2019 to be no different. For a rough guide on prices, last year it reduced the <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-home%2Fvoice-control-assistants%2Fgoogle-home-mini-chalk-10171098-pdt.html%3Fawc%3D1599_1569506104_e5b3d231b2564d2fd3acc914b6398b65%26srcid%3D369%26xtor%3DAL-1%26cmpid%3Daff%7ETelegraph%252Eco%252Euk%7EEditorial%2520Content%7E73846%7ETelegraph%2BMedia%2BGroup">Google Home Mini</a> from £49 to £29 and <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-home%2Fvoice-control-assistants%2Famazon-echo-dot-2018-charcoal-10186584-pdt.html">Echo Dot</a> from £49 to an incredible £19.99.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth looking out for deals on any audio kit that needs upgrading or replacing, including high-end headphones, sound bars, and smart speakers. There are normally great deals from the likes of Sonos, Sony and Sennheiser.</p>
      <p>Speaking of upgrades, kitchen appliance deals tend to offer some of the biggest pound-for-pound savings from Currys’ Black Friday and Cyber Monday selection.</p>
      <p>Last year, the super snazzy and energy efficient <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fhousehold-appliances%2Frefrigeration%2Ffridge-freezers%2Flg-gsl961pzbv-american-style-fridge-freezer-stainless-steel-10145208-pdt.html%3Fawc%3D1599_1569506795_cf3e6c4a06851518dc0b84a9b8cb9284%26srcid%3D369%26xtor%3DAL-1%26cmpid%3Daff%7ETelegraph%252Eco%252Euk%7EEditorial%2520Content%7E73846%7ETelegraph%2BMedia%2BGroup">LG GSL961PZBV American-Style Fridge Freezer</a> was reduced by £400 while the feature-packed <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fhousehold-appliances%2Fcooking%2Fcookers%2Fbelling-kensington-90dft-90-cm-dual-fuel-range-cooker-black-10148818-pdt.html%23srcid%3D11026%3Fawc%3D1599_1569506913_e163ba619ec98be10e17462938885f96%26srcid%3D369%26xtor%3DAL-1%26cmpid%3Daff%7ETelegraph%252Eco%252Euk%7EEditorial%2520Content%7E73846%7ETelegraph%2BMedia%2BGroup">Belling Kensington 90DFT Dual fuel range cooker</a> was reduced from £999 to £699.99.</p>
      <p>And, finally, it’s worth noting that one of Currys’ most popular Black Friday deals of all time was a flash deal, shared only on its Twitter account. The deal required a special voucher code, but reduced the Microsoft Surface Pro + Type Cover by £300, so we recommend checking in with them on social media throughout the day.</p>
