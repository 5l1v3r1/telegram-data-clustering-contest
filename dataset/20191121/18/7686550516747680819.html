      <h2>The premises has been empty since summer 2018</h2>

      <p>The former Bierkeller bar in Cardiff city centre is to be turned into offices.</p>
      <p>A planning application for the empty premises, which neighbours the Principality Stadium, has been submitted. The city centre spot has been empty since chain bar Bierkeller <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/cardiff-bierkeller-close-weekend-after-15042377">closed in August 2018.</a> At the time, a loss of trade due to the Central Square redevelopment, was blamed.</p>
      <p>The planning application is light on detail, but says the proposal is for the existing space to be turned into an open plan office. The existing entrance and exits will be used. The application has been submitted in the name of Azeemeh Zaheer, from Naissance Capital. Ms Zaheer is also the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/house-of-fraser-howells-cardiff-17288541">landlord of Howells in Cardiff.</a></p>
      <p>It is proposed 50 jobs will be created with the new venture. A planning application has been registered with Cardiff council and remains open for responses.</p>
