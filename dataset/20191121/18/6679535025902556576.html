      <p>Reports in the media that the safety of the Srisailam dam is under threat are false, according to Water Resources Minister P. Anil Kumar.</p>
      <p>In a release on Thursday, the Minister said that the reports were the “handiwork of the opposition parties and some media houses.”</p>
      <p>Stating that he had spoken with the officials concerned, the Minister said all measures were taken to ensure safety of the dam.</p>
      <h3>‘Unnecessary suspicion’</h3>
      <p>He appealed to those casting doubts on the dam’s safety not to create “unnecessary suspicion and myths” among the people.</p>
      <p>A few experts, including the Waterman of India and Magsaysay award winner, Rajendra Singh, recently perceived a threat to the dam’s safety and called for urgent repairs, triggering speculation that all was not well with the dam.</p>
