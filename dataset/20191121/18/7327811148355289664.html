      <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Supreme Court has rejected a state law that would have required President Donald Trump to disclose his tax returns to appear on the state's primary ballot.</p>
      <p>Justices said Thursday the law requiring candidates for president and governor to disclose financial information was unconstitutional.</p>

      <p>A federal judge had temporarily blocked the state law in response to a different lawsuit and the high court ruled quickly because the deadline for submitting tax returns to get on the primary ballot is next week.</p>
      <p>The state Republican Party and Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson challenged the bill signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom because it was aimed at Trump.</p>
      <p>The state defended the law, saying tax returns are a simple way for voters to weigh candidates' financial status.</p>
