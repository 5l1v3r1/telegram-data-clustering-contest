      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> are reportedly preparing to battle <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bayern-munich/"><b>Bayern Munich</b></a> for the services of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The Argentine is now a free agent after being sacked by Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday night with the London giants struggling for results during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Bayern <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/transfer-talk/news/bayern-munich-to-appoint-mauricio-pochettino-in-january_380077.html">are thought</a> to be keen to appoint Pochettino as the long-term replacement for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/niko-kovac/"><b>Niko Kovac</b></a> with interim boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hansi-flick/"><b>Hansi Flick</b></a> not seen as a genuine candidate for the role.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Sun</i>, Barca are ready to pounce for the South American as the speculation surrounding the future of current boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ernesto-valverde/"><b>Ernesto Valverde</b></a> continues to gather pace.</p>
      <p>Valverde will see his contract at Camp Nou expire at the end of the current season, and there is a feeling that both parties will seek pastures new ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.</p>
      <p>Pochettino turned out for Barca's Catalan rivals Espanyol as a player before managing the team between 2009 and 2012 ahead of a switch to Southampton.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are also thought to be keeping a close eye on developments despite the team's recent improvement under the management of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a>.</p>
