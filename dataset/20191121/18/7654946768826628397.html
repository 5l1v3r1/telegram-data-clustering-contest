      <p>Two airmen were killed Thursday morning in what officials called an “aircraft mishap” involving two trainer planes at a US Air Force base in Oklahoma, according to a report.</p>
      <p>The two T-38 Talons, each carrying two crew members, were being flown in a routine training mission at Vance Air Force Base in Enid when the accident occurred about 9 a.m., <a href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/11/21/breaking-aircraft-mishap-occurs-at-vance-air-force-base/">according to the Air Force Times</a>.</p>
      <p>The names of the deceased were being withheld pending notification of their next of kin. The accident remains under investigation.</p>
      <p>Vance is home to the 71st Flying Training Wing, which flies the T-1A Jayhawk, the T-6A Texan II, and the T-38 to train hundreds of pilots each year.</p>
