The internet has been blocked since Saturday.<br/><br/>Iran isn’t saying how many people have been killed, injured or arrested in the unrest.<br/><br/>Amnesty International estimates at least 106 people have been killed with the actual death toll much higher.<br/><br/>Trump’s tweets came as The Revolutionary Guards said calm had returned across Iran, state TV reported.<br/><br/>"The internet is being gradually restored in the country," the semi-official news agency Fars said, quoting unidentified informed sources.<br/><br/>Fars quoted the sources as saying the National Security Council that had ordered the shutdown approved reactivating the internet in "some areas and, according to reports so far, fixed line internet has been restored in Hormozgan, Kermanshah, Arak, Mashhad, Qom, Tabriz, Hamadan and Bushehr provinces, and parts of Tehran."</p>
