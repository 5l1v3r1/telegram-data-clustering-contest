      <p>The youngest Member of Parliament in Malaysia, independent Batu representative P Prabakaran seems to be in the crosshairs of people fighting in a power struggle in Anwar Ibrahim’s party.</p>
      <p>The PKR is undergoing upheaval with some MPs and ministers canvassing against Anwar in his bid to become the next PM of Malaysia.</p>
      <p>A columnist in Free Malaysia Today, Dennis Ignatius a former Malaysian ambassador said that mischief is brewing in the Batu parliamentary constituency with pressure mounting on P Prabakaran, to step down.</p>
      <p>He reports that political observers in Malaysia linked this to an ongoing power struggle within the PKR.<br/>Yesterday, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad referred to the struggle in the PKR, saying it is an internal matter and he would not comment on it.</p>
      <p>Ignatius says trouble for Prabakaran began when the High Court ruled earlier this month that PKR vice-president Tian Chua was wrongfully denied the right to <a href="https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2019/11/20/mischief-brewing-in-batu-constituency/">stand for election last year.</a></p>

      <p>After the party was denied the chance to defend the seat, PKR backed the young independent candidate with the support of Tian Chua.</p>
      <p>“Now that Tian Chua is once again eligible to stand for election, however, his supporters are demanding that Prabakaran step down to make way for him,” writes Ignatius.</p>
      <p>Tian Chua was one of the signatories of a letter of support from the PKR to Azmin Ali after Anwar had said if the police had evidence the person in a gay-sex video that went viral in June was the latter, Azmin should quit.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest the nomination of the replacement to Dr Mahathir in the near future might be rigged with claims from other parties to have a majority in Parliament.</p>
      <p>Every single vote from the Pakatan will be important, given the rumours that Azmin has more than 15 to 20 MPs on his side.</p>
      <p>The PKR has 52 MPs in Parliament. There has been no suggestion as to who the youngest MP may vouch for. -/TISG</p>
