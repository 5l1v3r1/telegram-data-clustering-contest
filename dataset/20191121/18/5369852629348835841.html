      <p>MANCHESTER UNITED STRIKER Marcus Rashford insists there is no better manager for the club than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer despite suggestions they could be interested in Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Tottenham sacked Pochettino this week and replaced him with former United boss Jose Mourinho, with Spurs having won only four of their past 18 matches in all competitions.</p>
      <p>There has been talk that United could consider turning to Pochettino to take over from Solskjaer, whose side have only managed two more points than Spurs from their opening 12 Premier League games of the season.</p>
      <p>However, Rashford – who signed a new four-year contract in July – said Solskjaer’s plans were part of the reason why he committed his future to the club.</p>
      <p>“There was no hesitation from me over signing a new contract,” he told Sky Sports News.</p>
      <p>“And it was the same for Ole as well – I could see where his head was at, where he wanted the club to be at and for me it was just a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>“We were on the same page and wanted the same things for the club. Ole is a great guy and he has the club’s interests at heart so there’s not a better person for the job in my opinion.”</p>
      <p>While he supports Solskjaer, Rashford admits he will not be happy if United end the season in the Premier League’s top four but without winning a trophy.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have not won meaningful silverware since claiming the Carabao Cup and Europa League in Mourinho’s first term in charge in 2016-17.</p>
      <p>With the Premier League title seemingly out of their reach already this season – leaders Liverpool are already 18 points ahead of United after 12 matches – Solskjaer’s routes to success lie in the cup competitions.</p>

      <p>There is pressure on United to return to the Champions League after failing to qualify last season, but Rashford does not think 2019-20 can be considered a success unless they also win at least one of the Carabao Cup, FA Cup or Europa League.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a while,” the England international added about United’s barren run of titles. “If we come out of this season with top four but without a trophy, I wouldn’t be happy.</p>
      <blockquote>If we manage to get some trophies and get ourselves into the top four then, of course, it has been a successful season.</blockquote>
      <p>“For me, it is just about putting markers down for what we can do in the future because we know that this period is not going to change overnight, Ole’s not going to get what he wants overnight.</p>
      <p>“We have to bide our time and just be patient, as long as we keep working hard and believe in what we are doing – which I think the team do 100 per cent – then I think we will be fine.”</p>
