      <p>Chinese online trading giant <b>Alibaba</b> could receive about $ 11 billion from its listing on the <b>Hong Kong</b> Stock Exchange - the largest stock offering in the city since 2010, according to global agencies.</p>
      <p>The company confirmed that it has priced 500 million new shares at HK$176 ($ 22.50; $ 20:30) each in a statement on Wednesday. This is 2.9 percent below the closing price in New York last night and is 6 percent below the preliminary price announced last week, BTA reports.</p>
      <p>The firm is planning to have its shares start trading November 26 on the <b>Hong Kong</b> exchange under the ticker 9988. Eight is an auspicious number in Chinese culture, Al Jazeera reported.</p>
      <p>The mega share sale of the stock, defined as the world's largest cross-border secondary listing, is seen as a boost for <b>Hong Kong</b>, which recently entered its first recession in a decade because of five-month protests and growing anti-China sentiment.</p>
      <p>This will be <b>Hong Kong</b>'s largest stock sale for over nine year</p>
