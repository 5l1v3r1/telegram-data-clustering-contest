      <p>The Punjab education department on Thursday decided to keep all public and private schools in Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad closed on November 22 due to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1516450/lahore-air-remains-hazardous-as-air-quality-index-hits-447">poor air quality</a>.</p>
      <p>According to a notification issued by the provincial government, the schools will remain closed on Friday due to "dense smog" in the three districts.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the Punjab education department had prohibited holding all outdoor activities in public and private schools across the province till December 20 for the same reason.</p>
      <p>The government had directed all students to wear air filter masks during school hours. It had also decided to hold awareness sessions on environment in all schools. This is for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1515376/smog-forces-govt-to-close-schools-in-lahore-today">the third time</a> in a month that the government has decided to keep schools closed due to smog.</p>
      <p>Lahore's air quality remained 'very unhealthy' with an air quality ranking of 245 on Thursday evening, according to Air Visual's Air Quality Index (AQI).</p>
      <p>The Punjab capital was ranked the most polluted city in the world on Thursday, according to Air Visual, which records air pollution levels across the globe in real time.</p>
      <p>For the last four years, smog, rightly being called the fifth season of Lahore, has deprived the people of sunshine and dusk-hour charm as layers of toxic smoke engulf the horizon from November to February. The situation has worsened this year.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a group of students petitioned the Lahore High Court seeking a change in the AQI measurement system, and implementation of the Smog Policy.</p>
