      <p>Ruling BJP in Karnataka on Thursday expelled from its primary membership rebels Sharath Bachegowda and Kaviraj Urs, contesting the coming assembly polls as independent candidates, for anti-party activity.</p>
      <p>In separate letters to both Bachegowda fighting from Hoskote assembly constituency and Urs from Vijayanagara, BJP said, their contest against the party's official candidates was being considered as an anti-party activity.</p>
      <p>BJP on Wednesday had asked party rebels to withdraw their candidature by Thursday evening, the last day to do so for the by-polls to 15 assembly constituencies in the state to be held on December 5.Â </p>
