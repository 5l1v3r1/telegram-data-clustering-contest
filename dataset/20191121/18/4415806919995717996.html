      <h1>Limerick University Hospital's second MRI scanner will have 'very significant impact' on waiting times</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:11:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/evelyn-ring/" target="_blank">By Evelyn Ring</a></address>
      <p>A second MRI scanner at Limerick University Hospital will be installed and working by the middle of next month.</p>
      <p>At the moment there is only one MRI scanner in the public acute hospital serving the mid-west region that has a population of 473,000.</p>
      <p>HSE chief operations officer, Anne O'Connor, said the health authority is bringing in an external provider and the scanner will be on-site and operating from about December 11.</p>
      <p>Ms O'Connor, who was speaking during an update on the HSE's Winter plan, said the second scanner will have a "very significant impact" on the waiting time for MRIs.</p>
      <p>The second scan should also help ease overcrowding at UHL due to a combination of insufficient capacity and high attendances in the emergency department.</p>
      <p>Ms O'Connor said patients attending hospital EDs wait there for scans and that clinicians are reluctant to discharge patients until they have had their scan.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the HSE expects the flu season will start in Ireland over the next two to three weeks.</p>
      <p>The HSE's assistant national director of health protection, Dr Kevin Kelleher, said they are just beginning to see an upsurge in reported cases of flu.</p>
      <p>“We have had 19 hospital cases last week and already one person with the flu virus has been admitted to intensive care,” said Dr Kelleher.</p>
      <blockquote>So it shows that, as ever flu, is not a mild disease. We are still at a point where prevention is possible.</blockquote>
      <p>Dr Kelleher said 30 flu specimens have been laboratory tested and they show that the virus types are mainly A and H3N2 that would predominately affect the elderly but the vaccine should give good protection.</p>
      <p>He urged pregnant women to get vaccinated because they could get a really bad dose of the flu and die.</p>
      <p>“It can be really catastrophic for one or two pregnant women each year.”</p>
