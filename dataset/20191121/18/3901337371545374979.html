      <p>Remember former Mamelodi Sundowns and Maritzburg United Keeper Glenn Verbauwhede? The Belgian was rated as one of the funniest goalkeepers in the world.</p>
      <p>Verbauwhede was brought in by the Brazilians in the 2012/13 season to solve their goalkeeping woes, but was released a year later after failing to live up to his billing.</p>
      <p>He then enjoyed spells with Free State Stars and Maritzburg United respectively, before hanging up his boots in 2016.</p>

      <p>It was entertaining as much as it was strange for fans, who were kept in stitches by this queer behavior.</p>
      <p>Check out some of the goalkeeper’s craziest moments below: </p>
