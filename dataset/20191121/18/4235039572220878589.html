      <p>German luxury car maker <b>Porsche</b> has announced an ambitious plan to fight the market for electric cars with <b>Tesla</b>'s dominant US company, AFP reports.</p>
      <p>More than half the cars produced by <b>Porsche</b> will be electric by 2025, the German manufacturer's North American chief Klaus Zellmer said during the Los Angeles Auto Show, Economic Times reported.</p>
      <p>"The future is electric," said <b>Klaus Zelmer</b>, director of the North American company, ahead of the grand opening of a major Los Angeles auto show. "By 2025, <b>Porsche</b> will have crossed a tipping point, actually building more than 50 per cent of its annual volume ... with either plug-in hybrid technology or fully battery," he said. However, he added, the "combustion engine of course is not dead", pointing to <b>Porsche</b>'s popular 911 sports cars.</p>
      <p><b>Porsche</b>, which is owned by Volkswagen, unveiled its new electric <b>Porsche</b> Taycan model at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September. The luxury model is targeting <b>Tesla</b>'s market share in the US. </p>
      <p><b>Tesla</b> has an especially firm grip on the US, which is <b>Porsche</b>'s second-largest market, AFP reported.</p>
      <p>In 2021, the German company will launch a fully electric version of its Macan SUV, which will be aimed directly at the <b>Tesla</b> Model Y model. </p>
