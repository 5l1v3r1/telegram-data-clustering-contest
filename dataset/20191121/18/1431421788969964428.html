      <h1>After Indictment, Gantz's Party Quotes Netanyahu: 'A PM Up to His Neck in Investigations Has No Mandate'</h1>
      <h2>Labor Party plans to file High Court petition demanding Netanyahu take leave of absence following indictment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:28:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968265" target="_blank">Jonathan Lis</a></address>
      <p>The Kahol Lavan party, led by Benny Gantz, responded to the indictment filed against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday by quoting the the premier himself, tweeting that "A prime minister steeped up to his neck in investigations doesn't have a moral or public mandate to make such fateful decisions regarding the state of Israel."</p>
      <p>The quote in question was a statement made by Netanyahu in 2008 regarding former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was embroiled in a corruption investigation at the time and later went to jail.</p>
      <p>"There is a real, not unfounded fear that he will make decisions based on his own interests of political survivability rather than the national interest," <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-benjamin-netanyahu-1.5599046">Netanyahu</a> had said at the time.</p>
      <p>On his personal account, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-Benny-Gantz-1.6806259">Gantz</a> called the announcement "a sad day for the State of Israel."</p>
      <p>Yisrael Beiteinu chairman Avigdor Lieberman echoed Gantz's sentiments. "This is a difficult day for the State of Israel. We need to give the wheels of justice to give their work and give the prime minister to prove his innocence in court," Lieberman tweeted.  </p>
