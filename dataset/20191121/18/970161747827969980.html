      <p>When Kourtney Young married Tanner Krietemeir, she had a beautiful day – but one person was missing.</p>
      <p>Her dad Donnie was shot and killed in 2005, while working as a police officer.</p>
      <p>But her mum Kelly had arranged a special surprise.</p>
      <p>She knew that the father-daughter dance was going to be particularly poignant for Kourtney – so she got seven of Donnie’s colleagues to dance to Paul Simon’s Father And Daughter, with her.</p>
      <p>Kourtney, from Colorado, U.S., said: ‘It was a surprise my mom had planned.</p>
      <p>‘That song was something my dad played for me when I was little and he gave me a necklace with his badge number on it. So that song was special.</p>

      <p>‘All those officers were friends of my dad’s and our family, so they were invited to the wedding already.</p>

      <p>‘I was caught off guard, but it was such a cool thing and a special moment. A lot of those guys are really important to me so it was special to share that moment with them.’</p>

      <p>Two of the officers, Jeff Barron and Chris Shotts also walked down the aisle, behind Kourtney and her mum.</p>
      <p>One of the dancers, Danny Veith told FoxNews: ‘It was very emotional. I felt despair, like Donnie’s being robbed of this moment.</p>

      <p>‘Then I took stock of all that has happened in the last 14 years and looking at Kelly and all she has accomplished in the last 14 years since Donnie’s murder and then seeing Kelsey and Kourtney are these beautiful young women. Little girls no more.</p>
      <p>‘I just told her how Donnie was and is proud of her.</p>
      <p>‘Being the first to dance with her, I got to see every other officer walk out, very proud, happy fathers.</p>
      <p>‘And then as they turned their back to Kourtney to return to our group, every single one of them was crying.’</p>
