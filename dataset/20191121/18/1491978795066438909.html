      <p>Prince Andrew’s failure, in his BBC interview, to show any compassion for Jeffrey Epstein’s victims must surely trigger a debate about paring back the bloated monarchy and reviewing the extent of taxpayer support for it (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/prince-andrew-to-step-back-from-public-duties-for-foreseeable-future">Scandal forces prince to suspend public duties</a>, 21 November). Offering financial support and blind deference to such individuals as the Duke of York has damaged Britain’s reputation as a mature democracy.<br/><b>Cass Witcombe </b><br/><i>London</i></p>
      <p>• Prince Andrew’s lack of empathy is on a par with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/13/boris-johnson-refuses-to-apologise-for-slow-response-to-england-floods">Boris Johnson’s detached visit</a> to Yorkshire’s flooded villages and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2019/nov/05/grenfell-fire-victims-lacked-common-sense-jacob-rees-mogg-suggests-video">Jacob Rees-Mogg’s disdain</a> for the inhabitants of Grenfell Tower. Whatever qualities public schools inculcate in their students, clearly empathy is not one of them.<br/><b>Scott Wilson</b><br/><i>Strathkinness, St Andrews, Fife</i></p>
