      <h1>Fiat Chrysler chairman not worried by General Motors lawsuit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:46:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author">COLLEEN BARRY, Associated Press</a></address>
      <p><b>MILANÂ (AP)</b> - The chairman of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles indicated Thursday that the merger with French carmaker PSA Peugeot will not be affected by a General Motors lawsuit.</p>
      <p>John Elkann told reporters in Turin that the Italian American company would fight the lawsuit in court, adding "we are not worried."</p>
      <p>GM has accused Fiat Chrysler in a lawsuit filed at a U.S. district court on Wednesday of bribing union officials to get favorable contract terms from the United Auto Workers Union.</p>
      <p>Elkann, speaking ahead of an investor-day event for the Exor investment arm that controls FCA, was quoted by Italian news agency ANSA as saying there would be a memorandum of understanding with PSA by the end of the year, as previously announced.</p>
      <p>FCA said the lawsuit is "meritless."</p>
      <p>In the lawsuit, GM accused Sergio Marchionne, the long-time Fiat Chrysler CEO who died last year, of authorizing bribes worth more than $1.5 million to union officials in a scheme to impose unexpected labor costs on GM.</p>
      <p>"I am sorry that one is making false accusations against a person like Marchionne who cannot defend himself," ANSA quoted Elkann as saying.</p>
      <p>Marchionne's successor as Fiat Chrysler CEO, Mike Manley, said in a letter to employees that the lawsuit "rehashes a collage of salacious public allegations" from a pending case involving a training center, and "at first review, beyond unsupportable speculation, does not include any new factual allegations."</p>
      <p>Manley said the company "would not be slowed down by this act," adding "let's keep the performance up, as it has clearly got some of our competitors worried."</p>
      <p>Since 2017, eight people have pleaded guilty in an investigation of union officials and Fiat Chrysler executives enriching themselves with money from a job training center in Detroit. The probe appeared to widen this summer when a former UAW official was charged with accepting kickbacks from union vendors.</p>
