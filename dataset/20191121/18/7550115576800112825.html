        <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joe-gomez/">Joe Gomez</a> are all back in training, allaying fears that they could miss Saturday’s clash with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both Salah (ankle) and Robertson (ankle) were reported to be major doubts for the trip to Selhurst Park, while Gomez (knee) was expected to be fit but had not trained by midweek.</p>
      <p>However, the trio were all involved in Thursday’s session, with the club’s official website <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/373992-melwood-training-gallery-crystal-palace">confirming</a> that Salah and Robertson “participated in elements of the workout with their team-mates.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a> was also part of the squad, after pulling out of Netherlands duty for personal reasons, indicating that he too will be travelling to London.</p>
      <p>The rest of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s internationals also returned, including <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/naby-keita/">Naby Keita</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/trent-alexander-arnold/">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/divock-origi/">Divock Origi</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/rhian-brewster/">Rhian Brewster</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/james-milner/">James Milner</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/adam-lallana/">Adam Lallana</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/dejan-lovren/">Dejan Lovren</a> were all involved after time off, along with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jordan-henderson/">Jordan Henderson</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/xherdan-shaqiri/">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> after their return from illness and injury.</p>
      <p>There was, however, no sign of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joel-matip/">Joel Matip</a>, who appears to still be struggling with the knee injury that has ruled him out for the past month.</p>

      <p>Lovren should, therefore, partner Van Dijk at the back, with Klopp likely to field a largely predictable side if both Robertson and Salah are fit to start.</p>
      <p>The manager does have options to reshuffle his lineup from the 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a>, though, with Oxlade-Chamberlain making a convincing case with his performances for England.</p>
      <p>But so too has Wijnaldum, who should keep his place after scoring a hat-trick as Netherlands captain in their 5-0 thrashing of Estonia on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Klopp is set to provide a more accurate update on his squad’s fitness in his pre-match press conference, which will be held at Melwood at 11.30am (GMT) on Friday.</p>
