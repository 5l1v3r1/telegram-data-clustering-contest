      <h3>Roasted Acorn Squash With Quinoa Stuffing</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Yields 4 servings</i>
      </p>
      <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>4 medium acorn squash </li>
        <li>1 tsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. (15 ml) pure maple syrup </li>
        <li>½ cup (85 g) uncooked quinoa </li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) vegetable broth </li>
        <li>2 tbsp. (30 ml) olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium red onion, diced </li>
        <li>½ medium red apple, diced </li>
        <li>⅓ cup (40 g) pecans, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1 tbsp. (15 ml) pure maple syrup </li>
        <li>4 cremini or white button mushrooms, diced </li>
        <li>1 tbsp. (15 ml) soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. (3 g) fresh thyme leaves </li>
        <li>Pinch of salt </li>
        <li>⅓ cup (65 g) fresh pomegranate seeds</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Method:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>To prepare the acorn squash, preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a medium baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut off the top of each acorn squash as well as a thin slice from the bottom so it will stand on its own. Remove the seeds and some of the squash flesh to make a bowl, being careful not to scoop out too much on the bottom side. </li>
        <li>To make the glaze, combine the oil and maple syrup in a small bowl, then brush each squash evenly with the glaze. Place the squash on the prepared baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the stuffing. Cook the quinoa in the broth according to the quinoa package's instructions.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, apple, pecans, and maple syrup and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the apple is soft and the onion is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms, soy sauce, cinnamon, thyme, and salt and cook for 5 to 10 minutes. Once the quinoa is done, add it to the pan and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the flavors have combined. </li>
        <li>Remove the squash from the oven. Fill each squash with the quinoa stuffing, then return the squash to the oven and roast for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove the squash from the oven, divide the pomegranate seeds among them, and serve warm. </li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Quick Tip: </b>When buying whole pomegranates, there's a very easy trick to take out the seeds without making a mess. Simply slice the pomegranate into 4 pieces, place them in a big bowl with water, and separate the seeds from the skin under water. The seeds will sink to the bottom while the skin will float on top! </p>
