      <h1>CNN's Chris Cuomo struggles to disprove Trump tweet by awkwardly calling his mom live on the air</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:13:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Brendan Morrow</a></address>
      <p>CNN's Chris Cuomo passed the time during a break of Thursday's impeachment hearing with a <i>MythBusters</i>-style experiment. It did not go well.</p>
      <p>Thursday's testimony featured a witness, diplomat David Holmes, reiterating to Congress that he overheard President Trump on a phone call with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland in July, with Trump speaking so loudly that he could be heard even while not on speakerphone. "I could hear the president's voice through the earpiece of the phone," <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/politics/david-holmes-opening-remarks-impeachment-hearing/index.html">he told Congress</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump in a tweet Thursday morning <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197521967777222656">claimed</a> this is impossible, which he would know because "I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life" and "my hearing is, and has been, great." Trump also wrote, "Try it live!"</p>
      <p>So Cuomo decided to do just that by calling his mom live on the air to see if Dana Bash, who was sitting to his right, could hear her. But after a few seconds of awkward silence, Cuomo just put his mom on speakerphone, at which point she was audible. He then seemed to take her off speakerphone, and more awkward dead air set in as she couldn't be heard anymore.</p>
      <p>Still, Cuomo declared victory and claimed Bash could, in fact, hear his mom while she was off speakerphone, though we'll just have to take his word on that, basically making the experiment a complete waste of time.</p>
      <p>"She does constantly tell people I'm a mistake," Cuomo, for some reason, decided to add of his mom before the panel mercifully moved on.</p>
