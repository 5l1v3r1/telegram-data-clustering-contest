      <h1>Gorillaz Reveal Plans for New Documentary 'Gorillaz: Reject False Icons'</h1>
      <h2>The film will be in theaters for only one night.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:08:05+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Montes</a></address>
      <p>Two months after <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/gorillaz-g-shock-second-collaboration-release">reconnecting with G-SHOCK</a> for a second, album-art-inspired collaborative effort, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/gorillaz">Gorillaz</a> are introducing a new documentary film known as <i>Gorillaz: Reject False Icons</i>. Directed by Denholm Hewlett, Gorillaz: Reject False Icons chronicles the studio sessions surroudning the group’s past two studio albums, 2018’s The Now Now and 2017’s Humanz, as well as the subsequent touring that supported the aforementioned full-length projects. Vince Staples, Pusha T, Kelela, Danny Brown, Noel Gallagher and other high-profile artists and collaborators will also make appearances during the movie.</p>
      <p>“Gorillaz isn’t about anything specific,” Gorillaz architect explained to <i>The Guardian</i> during a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/30/damon-albarn-and-jamie-hewlett-we-fight-over-everything-gorillaz-humanz-interview">2017 interview</a>. “It’s very unruly. You can go anywhere and do anything, and that’s the whole point of it. There’s no agenda. I’ll go with what’s exciting, and I’ll make it work, because I can pretty much lend my hand to anything, musically.”</p>
      <p>You can take a look at the official Instagram announcement about <i>Gorillaz: Reject False Icons</i> below, and head on over to the film’s <a href="https://www.rejectfalseicons.com/">website</a> for more information. <i>Gorillaz: Reject False Icons</i> will be in theaters for one night only on Monday, December 16.</p>
