      <h2>Draft policy will be put out for public discussion: Minister</h2>

      <p>The State government will come out with an integrated policy on fisheries for promoting both inland and marine fisheries, according to Minister for Fisheries, Ports, Inland Water Transport and Muzrai Kota Srinivasa Poojary.</p>
      <p>Addressing presspersons here on Thursday, he said that the draft policy, which is ready, will be put out for public discussion after two weeks from now. It would have to be discussed particularly by the fishing community.</p>
      <p>The draft policy dealt with aspects related to fish seed production, their rearing and transportation, developing infrastructure for promoting marine and inland fisheries, construction of jetties, basic needs of mechanised boats, security of fishermen, fisheries in the future and the like.</p>
      <p>Once the policy becomes final, it will be placed before the Cabinet for approval. If certain elements of the policy were to be incorporated in the Karnataka Inland Fisheries (Conservation, Development and Regulation) Act 1996 and the Karnataka Marine Fishing (Regulation) Act 1986, the law will be amended suitably later.</p>
      <p>The Minister said that, at present, there is a demand for 50 crore fish fingerlings in the State. But the government and the private sector are able to meet only 50 % to 55 % of it.</p>
      <p>Mr. Poojary said that the government has planned to take up a ₹ 4.73-crore project for upgrading the fish seed production and rearing centre at Narayanapur in the State.</p>
      <h3>Matsya Darshinis</h3>
      <p>He said that the government has proposed to open 31 Matsya Darshinis to serve fish food at a cheaper rate in the first phase. It has reserved ₹ 11 crore for them. They would be opened in the district and taluk headquarters. Some of them would also sell ornamental fish.</p>
      <p>Some of the places identified for opening them are Bengaluru, Shivamogga, Mysuru, Tumakuru, Hassan, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Ballari, Mangaluru, Udupi, Puttur, Sullia and Belthangady.</p>
