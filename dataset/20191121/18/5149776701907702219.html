      <p>A pregnant mother from Mansfield has described how she was “seconds away” from being buried under a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/environment">landslip</a> while taking her daughter to school.</p>
      <p>Lisa Riley - who is 35 weeks pregnant - said it sounded like “an animal was running down the cliff” when the incident occurred, that left her one-year-old daughter screaming in her pram.</p>
      <p>She feared going into labour early due to the shock she felt at the time.</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Police were called to the scene just after 9am on November 21 on Rock Hill, which has been partially closed between Broxtowe Drive and Carter Lane.</p>

      <p>Another resident said the landslip in Rock Hill didn’t shock him as people living in the area thought something like this could happen for years.</p>
      <p>The incident follows a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/mansfield-mudslide-triggered-torrential-rain-3517304">recent mudslide in Berry Hill Quarry on November 7</a>, where 35 homes were evacuated.</p>
      <p>Lisa, who is 29-year-old and lives nearby in Mansfield, said: “We were seconds away from it and only feet away from where it started landing.</p>
      <p>”It sounded like an animal running down the cliff. I carried on walking and just as I was going past where the fence is now, it all started coming down.</p>
      <p>“I was absolutely shocked and someone said I was lucky to not be under it. I’m 35 weeks pregnant and the whole thing made me feel like I could have gone into labour.</p>
      <p>“It was unbelievable how fast it came down.”</p>

      <p>Lisa was walking her eight-year-old daughter to school at the time with her one-year-old daughter, Keera, in her pram.</p>
      <p>She added: “It could have been a totally different outcome. It has been on my mind all day too and made me feel like I maybe shouldn’t go out.”</p>
      <p>A neighbour said problems with water and drainage are common in Rock Hill and he feels it is related to the landslip.</p>
      <p>Paul Winchester, 64, and a resident of Rock Hill for 30 years, said: “There have been problems with water in the area for some time. I’ve been told it has something to do with the rain and the water leak of a pipe or something.</p>

      <p>“I have been here for 30 years and this is the first time I have seen something like this happen.</p>
      <p>“I came home from work this morning and saw the police here, it was a bit of a shock.</p>
      <p>“You can often see it coming out of the road, especially with bad rain.”</p>
      <p>Dave Shaw, a 51-year-old builder who has lived in Rock Hill for nine years, added: "It’s been known for the best part of 10 years that it could happen. They have had surveyors come down here and they said it would not collapse, but I think there has been movement on it for a long time.</p>
      <p>“I’ve felt like it was going to happen eventually.</p>
      <p>“A big problem is that no one seems to know who owns the hill and who should be maintaining it. I’ve tried to find out myself.</p>
      <p>“Because of that, it really wasn’t a shock to me.</p>

      <p>“There is a problem with the drainage here I think because I've been told it’s leaking into the old cave houses.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the police said: "We were called at 9am. Officers have been providing traffic management at the scene."</p>
      <p>Building control managers and site managers from Nottinghamshire County Council and Mansfield District Council have been at the scene.</p>
      <p>Martin Carnaffin, a contract manager for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-county-council">Nottinghamshire County Council</a> who was at the site, added: “We believe that any further material that falls can be safely contained within our traffic management area.</p>
      <p>“It’s too early to say definitively what has caused this. We will have to leave it as it is for now to keep the site safe and come up with a permanent solution."</p>
      <p>“Our priority is road safety.”</p>
      <p>A Mansfield District Council spokeswoman added council building control officers are on site and the incident is being investigated.</p>
