      <h1>Bristol City's top 5 most valuable players on Football Manager 2020</h1>
      <h2>The manager simulation game is back and more addictive than ever</h2>

      <p>Every football fan's most addictive game is back.</p>
      <p>Football Manager is the perfect way for fans to immerse themselves into the world of football and take the reigns at their favourite club.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> look promising this year and you could be the one to take them all the way to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>City have some high value players in their squad, according to Football Manager, but it's up to you whether you cash in or try and keep them at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>Here are the top five most valuable players at City on the game this year.</p>
      <h3>1. Tomas Kalas- £8m</h3>
      <p>The man mountain at the back comes up first. Your defence will fare well with the former Chelsea man in the side and it shows with his stats, as his strength, pace and tackling are all rated at least 14/20.</p>
      <p>The Robins defender was on top form in his last match against Cardiff and could replicate that form in the game. Keeping Kalas happy in your team should be a priority.</p>
      <h3>2. Adam Nagy- £7.25m</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adam-nagy-making-injury-worse-3552321">The Hungarian international</a> has only just returned to action so Robins fans have yet to see the best of Nagy.</p>

      <p>If Football Manager's valuation is anything to go by, the form shown in his three games is set to continue. He will be a good choice should you decide to keep him in your midfield as his high stats for composure and anticipation will benefit the whole squad.</p>
      <h3>3. Daniel Bentley- £6.25m</h3>
      <p>City’s number one is highly rated by Football Manager and will be key to your plans to keep out the best the Championship has to offer, as he is for Lee Johnson right now.</p>

      <p>With four clean sheets so far this season Bentley has been an integral part in the Robins' good form, and with top stats for aerial reach and reflexes he will only mirror that when you take charge.</p>
      <h3>4. Josh Brownhill- £6m</h3>
      <p>It’ll be no surprise that the skipper is on this list, especially given his start to the season. In his 16 games from midfield Brownhill has contributed three goals and an assist, and you can expect more of the same on the game as his stats for set pieces and work rate are all very good.</p>
      <p>However, the 23-year-old is wanted by Swansea on the game so tie him down to a new contract if you want him to stay.</p>
      <h3>5. Jay Dasilva- £6m</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/every-championship-injury-suspension-ahead-3561590">The young left-back has been out for most of the season</a> with a fractured tibia which will affect you in the beginning of your managerial reign.</p>
      <p>However, Dasilva props up the list due to his age, his potential and his lightning pace, which is rated as high as 16/20.</p>
      <p>If you chose to keep hold of him, Dasilva will be a key cog in that system when he regains fitness.</p>
