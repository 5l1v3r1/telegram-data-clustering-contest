      <p>Jose Mourinho claimed he had been “smiling for two days” and promised not to repeat his mistakes of the past as he was formally unveiled as Tottenham manager on Thursday.</p>
      <p>From the moment the Portuguese proclaimed himself as the “Special One” on his arrival at Chelsea 15 years ago, Mourinho press conferences have always commanded attention.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency looks back at his first media outings in all of his Premier League jobs.</p>
      <h3>The Special One</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Chelsea (2004)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      <p>There was huge anticipation ahead of Mourinho’s arrival at Stamford Bridge following his Champions League success with Porto and he made an immediate impression with an electric performance in front of the media.</p>
      <p>“We have top players and, sorry if I’m arrogant, we have a top manager,” he said. “Please don’t call me arrogant, but I’m European champion and I think I’m a special one.”</p>
      <h3>The Happy One</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Chelsea (2013)</b>
      </p>

      <p>Almost six years after leaving Stamford Bridge, Mourinho returned for a second spell with the Blues.</p>
      <p>His return, he said, made him “the happy one”, although his unveiling was a more restrained affair than in 2004 as he repeatedly said he was “very calm” and “very relaxed”.</p>
      <p>“We are ready to work together again,” he said. “We have much better conditions to succeed and deliver what this club wants, which is stability.”</p>
      <p>He did, however, still show a little of his old hubris when asked about criticism he “damaged” Spanish football during his time at Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>“I damaged Spanish football by being the man that broke Barcelona’s dominance,” he said.</p>
      <h3>The List</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Manchester United (2016)</b>
      </p>

      <p>Any thoughts Mourinho’s self-confidence may have been harmed by the humbling way his second spell at Chelsea ended were dismissed as he arrived at Old Trafford as sharp-tongued as ever.</p>
      <p>There was no self-anointed title this time but there was little humility and no admission of errors from his time at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>He was soon into his stride with a dig at old rival Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>“There are some managers that the last time they won a title was 10 years ago,” he said. “The last time I won a title was one year ago.”</p>
      <p>Predecessor Louis Van Gaal was also in his firing line as he said there would be no “hiding behind philosophies,” a reference to a favoured term of the Dutchman.</p>
      <p>He then hit back at criticism he does not promote youth by producing a list – which did not stand up to close scrutiny – of the 49 young players he claimed he had guided into first-team football.</p>
      <h3>The Smile</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Tottenham (2019)</b>
      </p>
      <p>In contrast to his dismal final days at United, Mourinho looked far more upbeat as he arrived at Tottenham, boasting of ambitions to win the Premier League next season.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been smiling for two days,” he said. “We cannot win the Premier League this season but – I’m not saying we will do – we can win it next season.</p>
      <p>“The potential of the club is huge, the potential of the club is great.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho said he had learned from his errors of the past.</p>
      <p>“I realised I made mistakes,” he said. “I’m not going to make the same mistakes. I’ll make new mistakes, but not the same.</p>
      <p>“I am humble, humble enough to try and analyse my career – not just the last year, but the whole thing.”</p>
      <p>This time he was also far more charitable to his predecessor, Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
