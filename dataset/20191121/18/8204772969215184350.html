      <p>The company, which has customers across the world including in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=India">India</a> where its software is enabled on more than 200 million phones, works on an annually-recurring licence model, helping mobile operators including Denis O’Brien’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Digicel">Digicel</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Reliance+Jio">Reliance Jio</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Celcom">Celcom</a> communicate with customers on their mobile device.</p>
      <p>Ms Mullane, formerly chief technology officer of NewBay Software, a company acquired for $100 million (€89 million) in 2011 by Canadian smartphone maker Research in Motion which subsequently became Blackberry, founded Madme in 2013. She also sat as a non-executive director on the board of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Independent+News">Independent News</a> &amp; Media (INM) prior to its sale to Mediahuis earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“Triona is a very worthy winner in what was a very competitive category this year,” said <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jenny+Melia">Jenny Melia</a> of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Enterprise+Ireland">Enterprise Ireland</a> and one of this year’s judges.</p>

      <p>Ms Mullane said the award represents a fantastic validation of what she has done so far.</p>
