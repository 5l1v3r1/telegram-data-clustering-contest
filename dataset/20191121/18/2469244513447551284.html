      <p>Bell ringers in Tiverton are celebrating the centenary of their local ringers’ guild.</p>
      <p>It was in 1874 that the Guild of Devonshire Ringers was founded to promote in Devon the type of “scientific” method ringing practised in other parts of the country. One of the key figures in its formation was Col. Charles Troyte of Huntsham Court and St Peter’s Tiverton was one of the original affiliated towers.</p>
      <p>In the years that followed the Guild grew in numbers of towers and members.</p>
      <p>After World War I it was felt local groupings were necessary, so in 1919 the North East Branch of the Guild was set up to cover the Tiverton and Cullompton area. Branches covering other parts of the county were established at the same time.</p>
      <p>Over the last fortnight ringers in the Branch have been celebrating the 100th anniversary with special rings in each of the founder towers – Bampton, Bickleigh, Calverleigh, Holcombe Rogus, St Peter’s in Tiverton and Washfield. Twenty-five members have rung in a total of 12 events and raised over £150 for the Bell Restoration Fund.</p>
      <p>Celebrations culminated in a centenary dinner held at the Hartnoll Hotel where members enjoyed a three-course meal and viewed a display about the history of the branch and ringing memorabilia.</p>
      <p>Many churches in the area are looking for new ringers to join them. If you are interested in learning to ring contact:  <a href="mailto:les@troyteringingcentre.org.uk">les@troyteringingcentre.org.uk</a> .</p>
