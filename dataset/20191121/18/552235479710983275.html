      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> has vowed to take on "vested interests" in society as he set out a radical programme to invest in public services, tackle climate change and re-nationalise key utilities.</p>
      <p>Launching <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/labour">Labour's</a> UK manifesto in Birmingham, Corbyn said they were offering an agenda for "real change" at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> with policies the "political establishment" had blocked for a generation.</p>
      <p>The 105-page document set out plans for what the party said was the "largest scale investment programme in modern times" to fund the jobs and industries of the future.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It includes: <br/>- A "green industrial revolution" to tackle climate change with a shift to renewables and creating a million new jobs.</p>
      <p>- Bringing back rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership and delivering full-fibre broadband free to everyone in the country</p>
      <p>- Introducing a "real living wage" of at least £10-an-hour while ending zero hours contracts and strengthening trade union rights.</p>
      <p>- Creating a national education service providing through-life learning and scraping university tuition fees.</p>
      <p>- Providing additional funding for the NHS and reversing a decade of cuts for the police.</p>
      <p>- Getting Brexit "sorted" within six months, giving the public the final say in a referendum.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Corbyn</a> said: "This manifesto is the most radical and ambitious plan to transform our country in decades.</p>
      <p>"In an election offering a once-in-a-generation chance of real change we can end privatisation and rescue our NHS.</p>
      <p>"We can get Brexit sorted and bring our country together.</p>
      <p>"We can tackle the climate emergency that threatens us all.</p>
      <p>"And we can rewrite the rules of our economy to work for the many, not the few."</p>
