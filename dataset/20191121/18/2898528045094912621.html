      <h1>Miranda Granger replaces Veronica Macedo, meets Amanda Lemos at UFC Busan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:53:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author">Guilherme Cruz, https://facebook.com/guicruzmma/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3803/veronica-macedo">Veronica Macedo</a> was <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/13/20963580/veronica-macedo-still-fighting-ufc-busan-sao-paulo-ariane-lipski-mma">hoping to fight twice in five weeks</a> in the UFC, and now she’s left with no fights at all, as she was forced out of a UFC Busan bout with <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4119/amanda-lemos">Amanda Lemos</a>. According to multiple sources, Lemos now faces <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5034/miranda-granger">Miranda Granger</a> in a strawweight contest on Dec. 21.</p>
      <p>Macedo was already lined up to face Lemos in South Korea when she agreed to take on <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4605/ariane-lipski">Ariane Lipski</a> on 10 days’ notice at UFC Sao Paulo on Nov. 16, replacing <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4327/priscila-cachoeira">Priscila Cachoeira</a>. The day before the weigh-ins, though, Macedo was <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/15/20966254/ariane-lipski-ufc-sao-paulo-veronica-macedo-out-isabella-padua">removed from the card</a> with concussion-like symptoms.</p>
      <p>Macedo was still scheduled to fight Lemos next month, but ultimately got pulled from UFC Busan card as well since she’s currently hospitalized in Sao Paulo.</p>
      <p>Granger, who replaces the Venezuelan fighter on a month’s notice, was undefeated as an amateur (5-0) and has never lost as professional (7-0). Granger scored an unanimous decision victory over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5035/hannah-goldy">Hannah Goldy</a> in her Octagon debut in August.</p>
      <p>Lemos (6-1-1), who lost her short-notice UFC debut against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1837/leslie-smith">Leslie Smith</a> at bantamweight in 2017, moves all the way back down to strawweight for UFC Busan. This is her first fight since serving a two-year USADA suspension for stanozolol.</p>
