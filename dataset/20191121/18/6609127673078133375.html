        <b>A SERIAL flasher has been caught exposing himself to Edinburgh McDonald's staff - just a year after performing "helicopter-like moves" with his genitals in the same restaurant.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shameless Ryan Dolan, 30, flashed his tackle at shocked workers and members of the public as he stood outside the capital's South St Andrew Street branch.</p>

      <p>Dolan banged on the window to get everyone's attention before dropping his trousers for a full 18 seconds at around 5am on July 27 this year.</p>
      <p>Staff said he then ran away.</p>
      <p>Dolan, from Musselburgh, East Lothian, pleaded guilty to the charge of public indecency at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.</p>
      <p>It's <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/3522322/edinburgh-mcdonalds-ryan-dolan-drunk-helicopter-genitals-court/">the second time</a> the garage worker has targeted staff at the same McDonald’s fast food store by exposing himself.</p>
      <p>He was caught flashing his genitals when he staggered into the restaurant and made “helicopter-like moves” with his exposed tackle on July 22 last year.</p>
      <p>Dolan jumped up on the counter and dropped his trousers and performed a bizarre dance while waving his genitals around.</p>

      <p>He was sentenced in November last year where the court heard Dolan had two previous convictions for similar offences. He was fined £500.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday prosecutor Eilidh Yates said: “Staff saw the accused standing outside knocking on the window.</p>
      <p>"He knocked on the window again and then exposed his genitals to the staff and to members of the public.</p>
      <p>“He did so by dropping his trousers.”</p>
      <p>The court heard “CCTV showed it was for around 18 seconds” that Dolan had exposed himself for before “pulling up his trousers and leaving the area”.</p>
      <p>The fiscal said the Crown did not believe the offence was sexually motivated and was not seeking a conviction that could lead to Dolan having to register as a sex offender.</p>
      <p>Dolan had previously pleaded guilty by letter and defended himself during his court appearance.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Peter McCormack said: “You have an analogous conviction from 2018 so I am going to impose a relatively higher fine than I otherwise would have.</p>
      <p>“It is not the first time something of this nature has happened.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff said he would have fined Dolan £900 but reduced the fine to £600 due to his early guilty plea.</p>
