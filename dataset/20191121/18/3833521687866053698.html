      <h1>Microsoft delays its Apple AirPods rival until after key holiday season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:59:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:59</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Gurman</a></address>
      <p> Microsoft Corp. delayed the launch of its Surface Earbuds, missing the 2019 holiday shopping season. The software giant is the latest company to stumble in a race to catch up with Apple Inc.’s popular AirPods.</p>
      <p>The Surface Earbuds will come out in spring 2020, not this year as previously planned. The announcement was made by Panos Panay, the company’s chief product officer, on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The wireless earbuds were announced earlier this year, and like AirPods, are cord free. The Microsoft version has a circular shape, integrates with a voice assistant and can be used to control Microsoft software like PowerPoint.</p>
      <p>At US$249, the Surface Earbuds are priced the same as Apple’s new AirPods Pro, but the delay means Microsoft will be missing out on a key category this holiday season.</p>
      <p>Google has also been working to upgrade its wireless earbuds. That product will also be missing this holiday season. The company is aiming for a release in the spring at a price of US$179.</p>
