      <p>Things are set to escalate in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> tonight as Jacobâ€™s recent treatment of Leanna becomes public news and her dad Liam Cavanagh (Jonny McPherson) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/emmerdale-spoilers-liam-arrested-jacob-leanna-maya-pregnant-11193949/">goes on the warpath to punish the teen for his behaviour</a>.</p>
      <p>Leanna was left hurt after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-warren-plant/">Joe-Warren Plant</a>) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-teen-sex-jacob-leanna-maya-pregnant-11190559/">took her virginity and then was cold and distant afterwards</a> and has since implied that she felt pressured by him into having sex.</p>
      <p>Jacob will have to answer for his behaviour soon enough, but will Leanna ever learn the truth about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/22/is-maya-stepney-returning-to-emmerdale-what-happened-between-her-and-jacob-10615145/">the cause of his fragile emotional state</a>? Only time will tell.</p>
      <h3>Who plays Leanna in Emmerdale?</h3>

      <p>With her father Liam set to be arrested for attacking Jacob and her step-mother <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-paedophile-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184198/">about to walk free from prison</a>, the future looks uncertain and undoubtedly troubled for Leanna in the Dales.</p>
