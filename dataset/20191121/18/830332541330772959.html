      <p>(CNN) - For those who are planning a holiday for next year and wondering which countries are the safest, a risk map published by an organization specializing in travel security may be of help.</p>
      <p>International SOS, a travel security services company, has released its annual<a href="https://www.travelriskmap.com/#/planner/map/security"> Travel Risk Map</a> for the forthcoming year.</p>
      <p>Based on medical and travel security risks -- including infectious diseases and political violence <b>-- </b>its color-coordinated map has five categories, ranging from "insignificant" to "extreme" risk.</p>
      <p>In its predictions for 2020, the safest countries to travel to are concentrated more heavily in the northern hemisphere.</p>
      <p>They are Denmark, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Slovenia, Luxembourg and Switzerland.</p>
      <p>The places deemed most dangerous are more widely scattered across the globe and include Afghanistan, Central African Republic (CAR), Somalia and Syria.</p>
      <p>Some countries don't fit into just one category and are therefore given a mixed rating.</p>
      <p>Mexico and Colombia are both examples of countries with mixed ratings -- some regions in both countries are of medium risk, while others constitute a high risk.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for International SOS told CNN that the map is designed around its clients.</p>
      <p>They added: "Obviously it is overall reflective of location risks, but we do advise that consumers do as much research on their destinations as possible."</p>
      <p>The UK, US, Canada, Australia, China and much of Europe were listed as low risk.</p>
      <p>Much of Africa has been deemed medium and high risk.</p>
