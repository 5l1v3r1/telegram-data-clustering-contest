      <h1>Report: James Franklin A Candidate For Florida State Job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:25:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>We’ve known for a while that the Florida State Seminoles are casting a wide net in finding their next head coach. But it looks like their efforts include taking a nice, long look at one of the Big Ten’s top coaches: Penn State’s James Franklin.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://247sports.com/college/florida-state/Article/FSU-football-coaching-search-latest-updates-Matt-Campbell-James-Franklin-Brian-Kelly-138875496/">Noles247</a>, representatives of FSU have spoken to Franklin’s reps as part of their vetting process.</p>
      <blockquote><i>Noles247</i> confirmed on Wednesday that representatives for FSU and Penn State coach James Franklin have talked at this point in the process.</blockquote>
      <p>Franklin has turned the Nittany Lions into a perennial Big Ten title contender. They’ve finished with at least nine wins in every year since 2016. Considering the state that the program was in prior to his arrival, Franklin’s turnaround has been nothing short of incredible.</p>
      <p>Adding to Franklin’s resume is his stellar three-year stint as head coach of SEC minnow Vanderbilt. The Commodores finished the 2012 and 2013 seasons with nine wins – most since 1915. They were also ranked after both seasons in the AP top 25 – the first time since 1948.</p>
      <p>Suffice it to say, Franklin’s ability to turn struggling programs into winners speaks volumes about his potential at FSU.</p>
      <p>But Franklin is far from the only big-name candidate the Seminoles are looking into at the moment. Noles247 also mentioned Notre Dame’s Brian Kelly and Iowa State’s Matt Campbell. We’ve <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/florida-state/florida-state-coaching-search-brian-kelly-interest">also been told the Seminoles have interest in Kelly.</a></p>
      <p>Per the same report, Campbell is “intrigued” by the FSU job.</p>
