      <p><b>Muscat: </b>The roof of Al Suwaiq fish market in North Al Batinah collapsed in heavy rain, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has confirmed on Thursday.<br/><br/>The confirmation comes after people circulated a post on social media on Wednesday. However, the Ministry has clarified that the fish market is under guarantee of the contractor and will be restored with better specifications. “The Ministry followed up on the fish market in the sea port in Al Suwaiq where only one part of the outer roof was affected without any leakage. The work is back to normal after cleaning and removing the affected parts from the ceiling,” Ministry added.</p>
