      <p>According to the former Chelsea and Manchester United manager, the “best gift” are the players already at the club.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese was announced as the new Spurs boss on Wednesday morning, just 11 hours after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked from the role with the team languishing at 14th position indicating their poor starts to the 2019-20 season.</p>
      <p>He told reporters:</p>
      <blockquote>“<i>The best gift are the players who are here. I don’t need new players. I just need to get to know these ones better.<br/></i><br/><i>“I know them well but you never know them well enough until you meet them.<br/></i><br/><i>“I told the players I came here because of them. I tried to buy some for different clubs and some I didn’t even try because you know how difficult it was.”</i></blockquote>
      <p>On Spurs’ title hopes, Mourinho added:</p>
      <blockquote>“<i>We can’t win the Premier League this season. Next season, I’m not saying we will win it, but we can win it.”</i></blockquote>
      <p>Mourinho will now have the first test when Tottenham face struggling West Ham at the London Stadium and Manuel Pellegrini is not expecting Tottenham to play too differently.</p>
