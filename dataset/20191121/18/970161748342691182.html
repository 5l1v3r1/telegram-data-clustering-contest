        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-price/">Katie Price</a> had her iconic pink Range Rover repossessed a month after getting a two-year driving ban.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former glamour model’s car was seen at Saxton 4X4 in Chelmsford after it got purchased at a car auction last week.</p>
      <p>Katie had been hit with a series of financial problems over the last year, which almost led to her declaring bankruptcy and entering into an Individual Voluntary Agreement.</p>
      <p>The word ‘repo’ was marked on the car’s windscreen but there has not been any further information released on what is happening with Katie.</p>
      <p>Her £75,000 Range Rover is possible the same one she was in when she was arrested for driving under the influence in 2018.</p>
      <p>Katie’s luck with cars just seems to be getting worse and worse.</p>

      <p>A witness told MailOnline: ‘It’s a very striking car but we didn’t know straight away that it belonged to Katie Price.</p>

      <p>‘But then one of the buyers told us that it was hers. We couldn’t believe how filthy it was.’</p>
      <p>The star – who started her own YouTube channel – was spotted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-price-gets-euromillion-lottery-20650362">getting a couple lines on the Euromillions lottery last month</a> after news broke of her apparent bankruptcy last month.</p>
      <p>She entered into an ongoing Individual Voluntary Arrangement with debtors in 2018.</p>
      <p>It reportedly allowed her to pay £12,000 a month over the course of four years.</p>
      <p>But a bankruptcy petition was placed on the IVA, and at a hearing at the Insolvency and Companies Court on Monday 18 October, Judge Sally Barber ordered the 41-year-old to be served with a draft petition notice within seven days.</p>
