      <p>The West African Examinations Council (<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/news">WAEC</a>) has announced the establishment of an Electronic Certificate Management System that will enable candidates request for their certificates.</p>
      <p>The exam body noted that the online portal was for private candidates sitting for the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination from September to November.</p>
      <p>This was disclosed by the Nigeria National Committee Chairman (WAEC), Mrs Binta Abdulkadri, in Abuja on Thursday at the 57th annual meeting of the council and presentation of awards to best performing candidates and schools.</p>
      <p>She said that WAEC has also deployed a “Quick Response Code on its certificates, thereby making it impossible to falsify certificates issued by the council.”</p>
      <p>The chairman said: “The Nigeria National Office, in particular, has taken advantage of Information and Communication Technology to improve its service delivery.</p>
      <p>“This development has enabled the council in Nigeria to achieve total migration from paper-based to electronic enrolment of candidates for its examinations.</p>
      <p>“The adoption of Advanced Printing Technology and deployment of a new technological solution, Item Differential Profile, are some of the innovations adopted by the council to tackle the menace of examination malpractice.</p>
      <p>“The Council in Nigeria has also perfected its Electronic Certificate Management System, an online portal being deployed to enable qualified candidates in the WASSCE for private candidates to request for their certificates online via a dedicated platform.”</p>
      <p>Olu Adenipekun, WAEC Head of Nigeria National Office, said the annual meeting was to enable members to effect positive changes in the education sector of the country.</p>
