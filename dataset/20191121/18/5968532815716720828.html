      <p>Power banks and Bluetooth speakers are two things that I just <b>can’t live without</b>. The only problem I have with them is the space they take up. If you’re like me, you should consider grabbing the <a href="https://andauth.co/TreblabFX100">Treblab FX100 Bluetooth Speaker</a> for <a href="https://andauth.co/TreblabFX100">just $42.50</a> with our <b>promo code</b>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://andauth.co/TreblabFX100">Treblab FX100</a> combines the toughness of an <b>IPX4</b> <b>water-resistant speaker</b> and the juice of a <b>7,000mAh power bank</b>. It’s two awesome devices in one and it’s built to withstand your wildest adventures. </p>
      <blockquote>Listen to music for up to 30 hours on a single charge.</blockquote>
      <p>Worried that using the <a href="https://andauth.co/TreblabFX100">Treblab</a> to charge your phone up will cut into your music time? Don’t be. The power bank and the speaker battery are separate so that you can <b>use both as needed</b>. </p>
      <p>I’ve done some goofy things to keep my <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-music-streaming-apps-for-android-213818/">music</a> playing on the go. I’ve played my speaker from inside my backpack and I’ve tried putting it in a sweatshirt pocket, but the <a href="https://andauth.co/TreblabFX100">Treblab</a> eliminates the need for that. It includes a rugged carabiner so you can <b>hang it right from your backpack</b> to blast your tunes.</p>

        <li><b>Listen for 30 hours on a single charge</b>.</li>
