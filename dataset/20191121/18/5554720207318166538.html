      <p>Colors TV’s reality show <i>Bigg Boss </i>turned into a battlefield as physical fights erupted between two contestants known as Punjab’s ‘Katrina Kaif’ and ‘Aishwarya Rai.’ This was after Siddharth Shukla and Asim Riaz continued to violently push each other third night in a row. Shehnaaz Gill is referred to as Punjab’s Katrina Kaif, while Himanshi had described herself as Punjab’s Aishwarya Rai.</p>

      <p>Siddharth Shukla was seen pushing Asim several times prompting <i>Bigg Boss </i>to warn both of them to avoid getting physical.</p>
      <p>Siddharth confronted Paras Chhabra for provoking Asim against him. Paras denied Siddharth’s allegations and asked Asim to confirm that he had not provoked him. But Asim did not agree with him leaving Paras embarrassed, Shefali too agreed with Siddharth accusing Paras of having provoked Asim against Siddharth.</p>
      <p>Asim also told Siddharth that he was being delusional in claiming that he was responsible for saving the former all through the show this season.</p>
      <p>The show also witnessed a fight between Adiya Vishal Singh and Devoleena Bhattacharjee. Little later, Paras was accused by <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/on-bigg-boss-show-contestant-forces-host-salman-khan-to-remember-painful-past-as-he-publicly-mention-aishwarya-rais-name/268456/">Himanshi Khurana</a> of touching her. This prompted Paras to become even more aggressive prompting Hindustani Bhau to charge at him. Hindustani Bhau warned Paras to be careful about his behaviour and tone towards Himanshi, who he’s declared his sister on the show. Paras was forced to apologise to Bhau for his aggressive behaviour.</p>

      <p>Paras later went to Asim for support but was left red-faced as the latter told him that he was wrong in commenting about Himanshi’s figure and touching her.</p>
      <p>Friday night will see contestants fight it out to elect their new captain. Siddharth Shukla and Himanshi Khurana have been selected to go for the captaincy’s role.</p>
