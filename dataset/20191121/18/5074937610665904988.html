      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:21:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Baah Boadi, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sefwi-Adabokrom (W/N), Nov.20, GNA - Fifty-Four tertiary students in the Bia East District of the Western North Region have been awarded scholarships totaling GH¢89,000.00 under the Government's decentralised scholarship for Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies. </p>
      <p>The students; 35 males and 19 females, are pursuing further studies in various public and private universities, colleges of education and nursing training colleges with some pursuing Masters’ Degree programmes.</p>
      <p>They received between GH¢1000.00 and GH¢7,500.00 each, depending on the course of study, which is subject to yearly renewal.</p>
      <p>Mr Richard Chebure, the District Chief Executive, who made this known in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, said the students were selected based on needs assessment and academic performance and not on political consideration.</p>
      <p>He expressed gratitude to the Government and the Scholarship Secretariat for decentralising the Scheme to cater for students outside the regional capitals.</p>
      <p>Mr Chebure advised the beneficiaries to give of their best and avoid truancy in order to pass all required exams.</p>
      <p>He urged others who did not benefit this year to apply next academic year.</p>
      <p>Mr Carlis JoJo Dolphins, a beneficiary pursuing Master of Research in Accounting, at the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, on behalf of the students, commended the Government and the Scholarship Secretariat for decentralizing the Scheme saying; “It's the best thing to ever happen in Ghana.”</p>
      <p>He called on the students to study hard to justify the investment and pleaded with the Secretariat to extend the Scheme to cover more students, especially those in cocoa growing areas.</p>
