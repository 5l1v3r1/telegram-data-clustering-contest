      <ul>
        <li>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and board member Peter Thiel met secretly with President Trump in October.</li>
        <li>The purpose of the meeting – and why it wasn’t disclosed by the White House – remains unknown.</li>
        <li>After Facebook revealed the meeting had taken place, Democrats dragged Zuckerberg on Twitter.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>President Donald Trump invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and board member Peter Thiel to a White House dinner in October, but didn’t disclose the meeting to the public.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-hosted-zuckerberg-undisclosed-dinner-white-house-october-n1087986">Facebook told NBC News about the secret meeting</a> on Wednesday. The dinner took place at the White House while Zuckerberg was in Washington to testify to Congress about his company’s Libra cryptocurrency.</p>
      <h3>Crypto Goes to Washington</h3>

      <p>It’s a sign of the times that two towering figures in the cryptocurrency industry met secretly with the president of the United States in October.</p>
      <p>There’s no word on what was discussed, although it’s hard to imagine cryptocurrency wasn’t at least mentioned in passing, given that Zuckerberg had <a href="https://www.ccn.com/zuckerberg-congress-facebook-cryptocurrency-libra-china-wins-spin/">just testified before Congress about Libra</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s just as likely that the trio discussed the 2020 election or national security. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2018/07/20/facebook-as-the-ultimate-government-surveillance-tool/#7def01d02909">Given the scope of Facebook’s surveillance power</a>, it’s now a perfect channel for the US intel community.</p>

      <p>And one of Peter Thiel’s other companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/palantir-army-contract-dcgs-a/">Palantir Technologies, is a major US government partner</a>, with an $800 million US Army contract to build software for the battlefield.</p>
      <p>But the mere fact that some of crypto’s leading innovators wield such political clout bodes well for the future of disruptive financial tech innovation. Thiel is an <a href="https://www.ccn.com/peter-thiel-touts-bitcoin-as-digital-gold/">avowed “bitcoin maximalist”</a> who’s invested a tidy sum in blockchain startups like <a href="https://www.prweek.com/article/1666431/peter-thiel-backed-crypto-startup-blockfi-hires-diffusion">BlockFi’s crypto lending and interest-earning crypto accounts</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ccn.com/breaking-trump-bashes-crypto-says-hes-no-fan-of-bitcoin/">President Trump bashed crypto this summer</a>, but many close to him (like Peter Thiel, Sen. Rand Paul, and one of his Fed picks) <a href="https://www.ccn.com/trump-fed-pick-judy-shelton-crypto/">are bullish on cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
      <h3>Bad Optics: Democrats Cry Facebook-Trump Collusion</h3>

      <p>Facebook has taken massive fire for its influence on US politics in the years following Donald Trump’s surprise victory in 2016. An undisclosed meeting between a president running for reelection and the embattled social media mogul is what political strategists would call “bad optics.”</p>
      <p>Donald Trump’s opponents responded to the news with hashtags like #DumpFacebook, #DeleteFacebook, and #FacebookDeleted.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/joshshepperd/status/1197373356158443520">One said</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Zuckerberg is turning into a uniquely dangerous political figure in world history.</blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/sequinpants/status/1197375402517225473">Others speculated the trio were colluding to engineer Trump’s reelection victory in 2020</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Remember with Trump, everything is a transaction.Trump can do A LOT for Facebook. And Facebook can in return do a lot for Trump.</blockquote>

      </figure>
      <p>The speculation is not entirely unfounded, nor merely motivated by partisan animus. Peter Thiel has been an outspoken Trump supporter. He’s one of the few conservative executives in Silicon Valley.</p>
      <p>The White House declined to comment on the dinner. Facebook’s disclosure of the meeting was couched in defensive language. In an emailed statement to NBC News, a Facebook spokesperson said:</p>
      <blockquote>As is normal for a CEO of a major U.S. company, Mark accepted an invitation to have dinner with the President and First Lady at the White House.</blockquote>
      <p>Mark Zuckerberg has faced intense criticism for his platform’s handling of political ads, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/politics/elizabeth-warren-facebook-ad/index.html">including its refusal to fact check candidates’ campaign ads</a>. News of the undisclosed meeting follows <a href="https://www.ccn.com/john-mccain-would-love-twitters-political-ad-ban/">Twitter’s decision to ban political advertising from its platform</a>, the same day that <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1189541048638459905">Hillary Clinton put Facebook on blast for its ad policy</a>.</p>
