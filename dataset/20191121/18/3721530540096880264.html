      <p>We can always count on a console bundle to lead the big three video game companies’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/black-friday">Black Friday offerings</a>, and 2019 is no different. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/7/20953318/black-friday-2019-nintendo-switch-mario-kart-8-deluxe-bundle">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/19/20972524/playstation-black-friday-cyber-monday-ps4-vr-console-controller">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/15/20967211/xbox-black-friday-2019-xbox-one-x-bundle">Xbox One</a> bundles will be discounted at pretty much every retailer come Nov. 29, but they’re often the first big ticket items to sell out.</p>
      <p>For two years in a row, Sony has presented the most compelling Black Friday gaming deal. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/20/18104855/spider-man-ps4-black-friday-sale">Last year’s <i>Spider-Man </i>PlayStation 4 bundle</a> was gone even before Black Friday started. Sony released its Black Friday deals on the Sunday before Thanksgiving and by that Tuesday stock had started to run low.</p>

      <p><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/03EaN">This year’s bundle</a> will likely be equally as popular. Dubbed the “Only on PlayStation” bundle, it comes packaged with three PlayStation exclusives: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/the-last-of-us/3040"><i>The Last of Us</i></a><i>: Remastered</i>,<i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/horizon-zero-dawn/38476"><i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i></a><i>: Complete Edition, </i>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games-2018/2018/12/21/18149534/god-of-war-game-of-the-year-2018">our 2018 game of the year</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/god-of-war/1080"><i>God of War</i></a><i>.</i> At $199.99, that’s a savings of around $160.</p>
      <p>If you’ve got your heart set on picking up this bundle, you might want to double check the sale’s start date. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/19/20972524/playstation-black-friday-cyber-monday-ps4-vr-console-controller">According to Sony’s official Black Friday ad</a>, those bundles will drop on Sunday, Nov. 24, a full five days before Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Listings for the “Only on PlayStation” bundle are already up at most major retailers. <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?sharedid=polygonbf19&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPaige-s-Bundle%2F431121707">According to Walmart’s listing</a>, they’ll go live at 9 p.m. PT on Nov. 23rd, so we’d recommend bookmarking the page at your retailer of choice and checking back on Saturday night. Links to current listings are below, which we’ll update as they sell out:</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Microsoft is also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/15/20967211/xbox-black-friday-2019-xbox-one-x-bundle">dropping its Black Friday deals</a> on Sunday. (<a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=polygonbf19&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%3F%26OCID%3DAID2000131_SEM_vVoNG4t0">Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold subscribers</a> can access software deals starting Nov. 21, though.) We don’t expect Xbox One deals to sell out as quickly, since Microsoft isn’t releasing any new bundles, instead offering deep discounts on existing ones. Still, if you’ve got your heart set on picking up a discounted Xbox One bundle, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles%2Fxbox-one-s%2Fall-digital-edition%23purchase&amp;referrer=polygon.com">Xbox One S All-Digital Edition</a> is the best deal at $149.99 ($100 off).</p>
      <p>Nintendo, on the other hand, is waiting until Thanksgiving Day to release its deals. The Switch bundle this year is actually <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/13/18091286/black-friday-deals-2018-nintendo-switch-2ds-mario-kart">a repeat of last year’s</a> — a Switch console with a free digital copy of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/mario-kart-8/8635"><i>Mario Kart 8</i></a><i> Deluxe</i>. It’s also worth noting that t<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/7/20953318/black-friday-2019-nintendo-switch-mario-kart-8-deluxe-bundle">he Switch included in the bundle is <i>not</i> the updated model with extended battery life</a> that Nintendo released earlier this year.</p>
