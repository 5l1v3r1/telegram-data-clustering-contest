        <b>Actor</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dr Rajkumar</p>
      <p>“I think Dr Rajkumar is the perfect actor. He was amazingly talented and the fact that he could sing like an angel made his presence on screen exciting. He was also the best actor who spoke the most beautiful Kannada ever.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Travel</b>
      </p>
      <p>Historial sites</p>
      <p>“I don’t like travelling, but have always loved history. I’ve always wanted to visit Egypt, Machu Picchu, Harappa, China, Greece, Paris, Rome, Germany, Russia, Easter Islands and Cambodia.”</p>
      <p>Music</p>
      <p>
        <b>Freddie Mercury</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I’m a huge fan of Freddie Mercury; his voice, technique, compositions, and the way he entertained the audience is great. My favourite Indian musician is K J Yesudas. Whenever I listen to his music, I am amazed. The combination of intense emotion and lyrical clarity makes him truly unique. I also like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Shreya Ghoshal.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Inspiration</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamsalekha</p>
      <p>“The first person who inspired me was Hamsalekha sir. I have worked with him for a few years and his energy, discipline, talent and unbelievable knowledge amazes me. Both my parents are graduates from National School of Drama. They are both well-read and good human beings. My mother, Sumathi is known for her role in women empowerment in Mysuru; her courage and selflessness deserve a salute. Chester Bennington, lead vocalist of Linkin Park, is another inspiration. The band’s songs helped me get through some dark phases in life.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Food</b>
      </p>
      <p>Biryani</p>
      <p>“Food is the greatest thing in the world. I consider food art. I am very particular about what I eat. I have experimented with food. My all-time favourite is biryani; I am a ‘Biryani<br/>bhakt’. I also like ‘Idli vade’. This is also why I don’t want to leave Bengaluru as it is the best place for foodies. I cannot forget my mother’s dosa; they are the best in the world.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Authors</b>
      </p>
      <p>Poornachandra Tejaswi</p>
      <p>“I credit my knowledge of English to music and that of Kannada to books. I used to read a lot of Kannada books but not as much any more. My all-time favourite is ‘Poornachandra Tejaswi’. I have read all his books and my Kannada vocabulary is framed around his literary works. Another brilliant poet is Siddalingaiah, who wrote poetry for the oppressed. Some of his works combined with compositions by my father Janardhan were magic.”</p>
