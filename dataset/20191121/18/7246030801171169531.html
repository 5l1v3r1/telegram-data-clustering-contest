      <h1>Shluchim – A Model For All Jews</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:22:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/rabbishmuelbutman/" target="_blank">Rabbi Shmuel Butman</a></address>
      <p>Every year (for three decades now), on the weekend of <i>Shabbos Mevarchim</i> <i>Kislev</i>, Chabad <i>shluchim</i> around the globe gather in New York for their annual convention. (The weekend was originally chosen because <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> <i>Kislev</i> 1977 is when the Rebbe returned home after suffering a heart attack during <i>hakofos</i> on <i>Shmini Atzeres</i> evening.)</p>
      <p>This Shabbos we read <i>Parashas Chayei Sarah</i>, which includes the first <i>shlichus</i> in the Torah – Avraham sending his servant Eliezer to select a wife for his son Yitzchak. Two <i>parshah</i>s ago, Hashem commanded Avraham to travel to an undisclosed land. At that moment began the special mission entrusted to Avraham and his descendants, the Jewish people, to refine and elevate this material world, to transform it into a worthy “dwelling place” for Hashem’s presence.</p>
      <p>Every Jewish soul sent into this world is privileged to be a <i>shliach</i> of Hashem, charged with a unique part of this exalted mission to create a Divine dwelling place. This mission is accomplished by fulfilling Hashem’s <i>mitzvos</i>, which are also called <i>shluchim</i> of Hashem, as the <i>Midrash </i>(<i>Tanchuma</i>, <i>Vayigash</i> 6) says, “Honor the <i>mitzvos</i>, for they are My <i>shluchim</i>, and one’s <i>shliach</i> is considered like oneself.” The <i>mitzvos </i>are G-d’s representatives,” creating a bond (<i>mitzvah </i>comes from the root <i>tzavsa</i> – to combine) between Him and those fulfilling them.</p>
      <p>Avraham received his <i>shlichus</i> when G-d commanded him to leave his home at the age of 75. His descendants received their <i>shlichus</i> when Hashem gave us the Torah at Mount Sinai, telling us (<i>Shemos</i> 19:6), “And you will be for Me a kingdom of <i>kohanim</i>” – meaning (as our Sages explain), a nation of Hashem’s representatives. By observing His <i>mitzvos</i>, we bring Divine holiness into the world, eventually influencing even non-Jews to rise higher through the observance of the seven Noachide commandments (see Rambam’s <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilchos Melachim</i> 8:10).</p>
      <p>Throughout our history, great leaders have given their disciples and others special tasks to spiritually elevate the world. The sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn (1880-1950), introduced a new perspective by designating every Jew as a <i>shliach</i> to help raise other Jews to a highly spiritual level by encouraging them to intensify their Jewish observance.</p>
      <p>It started when, under the anti-religious Bolshevik regime, he sent his followers on danger-filled missions to strengthen <i>Yiddishkeit</i>. They founded and funded underground <i>chedarim</i> and <i>yeshivos</i>, built secret <i>mikvaos</i>, and organized Torah study groups in shuls, among other activities. The Rebbe encouraged all conscientious Jews to follow their example. Later, when forced to leave the USSR, he sent his followers on similar missions in Eastern European lands and further afield. Finally, on his arrival here in the United States in 1940, he started sending <i>shluchim</i>, not only to far-flung locations in North America, but all over the world, even Australia and Africa – wherever there were Jews.</p>
      <p>These activities continued and grew dramatically under the leadership of his son-in-law and successor, the Rebbe of our generation. They have expanded to the point where official Chabad <i>shluchim</i> around the world now exceed 5,000, and that number continues to grow. Many Chabad <i>chassidim</i> who are not “official” Chabad <i>shluchim</i> are involved in similar activities as educators, rabbis of communities, and other positions through which they reach multitudes of Jews.</p>
      <p>Not only Chabadniks but many other Jews, too, have been inspired by their example and realize their role as <i>shluchim</i> of Hashem to spread Torah and <i>Yiddishkeit</i> as widely as possible. Gradually, all these efforts are influencing many previously uncommitted Jews to add a mitzvah or several to their lives, thereby fulfilling, at least partially, the purpose for which their soul descended into this world. As these efforts continue and increase, they bring the revelation of <i>Moshiach</i> ever closer – the ultimate purpose of every <i>shluchim </i>conference.</p>
      <p>We wish our fellow <i>shluchim</i> boundless success in their exalted mission as they serve as models to all Jews for realizing their G-d-given mission.</p>
