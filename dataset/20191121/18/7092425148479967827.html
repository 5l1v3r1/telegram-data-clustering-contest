          <b>Is Joe up to his old tricks again? </b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Netflix have just released first look images from the upcoming second season of <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/watch-netflix-drop-first-teaser-trailer-for-you-season-two-342946"><i>You</i></a>.</p>
      <p>In this new chapter, Joe leaves New York for LA as he runs from his long-lost ex-girlfriend Candace, but will he fall in love again after the death of his former flame?</p>
      <p>The new season sees Joe running from his ex-girlfriend Candace who is hell-bent on getting revenge on the psychopathic bookstore owner.</p>

      <p>Season one of the drama, based on Caroline Kepnes' 2014 book of the same name, follows Penn Badgley's Joe and his dogged obsession with a woman named Guienevere Beck, played by Elizabeth Lail.</p>
      <p>Although the follow-up will see Joe move to LA in the hope of a fresh start and "fully intending to start over a new leaf", a brand new image from You's second season reveals that nothing much appears to have changed.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/21/you-season-2-first-look-joe-love/"><i>Entertainment Weekly's</i> </a>exclusive look at season two, Joe can be seen watching a young woman doing her shopping - newcomer Victoria Pedretti's Love Quinn - from a distance.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/netflix-share-release-date-season-two-342782"><i>You's</i></a> showrunner Sera Gamble spoke to EW about Joe's relationship with Love, insisting that he is "a different guy" from the one viewers watched unravel in the first season.</p>
      <p>"It's not that simple love-at-first-sight Joe might've been looking for a couple of years ago," Sera explained. "He's a different guy. He's been through more. The circumstances of his encounter with Love are very informed by what he went through with Beck."</p>
      <p>While Joe might have learned a lesson over his pursuit of Beck, You is still going to be a bleak watch, with Sera Gamble recently singling out her favourite scene in an upcoming episode as something "gorier and scarier" than ever before.</p>

      <p>"Joe is always trying to be a good guy but yet somehow he's finding himself in these thriller, horror kind of situations," she said. "It's terrible for him but I think it's going to be so much fun for the audience."</p>
