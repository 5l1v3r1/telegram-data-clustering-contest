        <b>The latest taste of 'Notes On A Conditional Form'</b>
      </p>
      <p>After dropping their <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/track/1975-frail-state-mind-track-review">latest single ‘Frail State Of Mind’</a> last month, and giving it its live debut last Saturday, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-1975">The 1975</a> have now unveiled the track’s video.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The clip, which you can see below, mashes up glitchy images that are equal parts futuristic and retro, and features an androgynous Matty Healy surrounded by old school video screens.</p>

      <p>The band performed the song for the first time at the BB&amp;T Pavilion, in Camden, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-the-1975-debut-frail-state-of-mind-for-the-first-time-live-on-tour-2569045">New Jersey on Saturday (November 16)</a>.</p>
      <p>They’re currently playing several shows in North America in between finishing their upcoming album, <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/new-1975-album-music-for-cars-release-date-tour-dates-2151640">‘Notes on a Conditional Form’</a>, on which ‘Frail State of Mind’ appears.</p>

      <p>In the <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/track/1975-frail-state-mind-track-review#E8czkCXoQ3PwAuG5.99"><i>NME </i></a><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/track/1975-frail-state-mind-track-review#E8czkCXoQ3PwAuG5.99">review</a> of the single, we said: “It’s unclear exactly why Healy is feeling the way he is in ‘Frail State Of Mind’ or why he <i>always get[s] this way sometimes</i>, but, if anything can ruin a good night out or set off a mental collapse, it’s anxiety and dread.</p>
      <p>“In that way, The 1975 have once again made something that speaks very realistically to our modern condition.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday, meanwhile, it was announced that The 1975’s Dirty Hit labelmate <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/beabadoobee">Beabadoobee</a> is <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/beabadoobee-support-1975-uk-arena-tour-2569750">due to support them</a> on the UK dates of their arena tour in February net year.</p>
