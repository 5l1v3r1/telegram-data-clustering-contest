      <p>Accra, Nov.21, GNA- Guinness Ghana Breweries Plc has launched a national consumer promotion campaign dubbed “Link Up” that will give away GH¢1.5million worth of airtime to consumers across the country for their continuous loyalty and support.</p>

      <p>Speaking at the launch, Mr Samuel Dery, Marketing Manager of Stout, Adult Premium and Non-Alcoholic Drinks (APNADS) and Ready-To-Drink (RTD) at Guinness Ghana, said the company introduced the “Link Up” promo to make consumers enjoy more fun.</p>
      <p>To win the GH¢5.00 airtime, he explained that each time the consumer buys any three of the selected beverages, he or she has to look under crown for a unique code.</p>

      <p>Mr Dery said the promo was opened to all consumers, but limited to MTN users due to an exclusive partnership between the Company and MTN with the aim of brining the promotion to consumers from all lengths and breadth of the country.</p>
      <p>Madam Sylvia Owusu-Ankomah, the Corporate Relations Director of Guinness Ghana, said the Company sustained its innovation by always looking at new ways of exciting and appreciating its customers.</p>
