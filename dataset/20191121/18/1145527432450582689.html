        <b>Earlier reports have revealed a fast 120Hz screen, Snapdragon 865 processor and an improved camera setup for the Samsung Galaxy S11</b>
      </p>
      <p>The list of leaks surrounding Samsung Galaxy S11 grows longer as the launch date for next-generation Samsung flagship draws close. Expected to be launched in February, a lot has been revealed about the Galaxy S11 line up of smartphones in recent leaks. Latest reports have confirmed some more features of the Samsung Galaxy S11.</p>
      <p>As per information on Chinese certification agency 3C, Galaxy S11 (model number SM-G9860) will come with 5G capabilities and 25W fast charging capabilities out of the box. However, the company will most likely launch a 4G variant of Galaxy S11 as well. As for its charging capabilities, 25W fast charge on Galaxy S11 will surely put it ahead of Galaxy S10 devices, but it's still not as good as 45W on Galaxy Note10+.</p>
