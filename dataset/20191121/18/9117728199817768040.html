      <h1>Daniel Ricciardo "happy and fulfilled" with good results despite lack of podiums</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> says that he is coming to terms with his new life at Renault, accepting that a good result can still make him happy, even if it is not a win or podium finish. Ricciardo has finished in the points just eight times this season, with a best finish of fourth in Italy.</b>

      <p>A seven time Grand Prix winner, Ricciardo made the brave move to Renault for the 2019 season, and probably expected more than the 54 points he has scored so far this season.</p>

      <p>However, he has come to the realisation that he can be content with a solid points finish, such as the P6 he took home from last weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>He said, according to motorsportweek.com: <i>“I’ll always leave a race track happy and fulfilled if I know I’ve got everything out of it.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I won’t lie, that is heightened by taking home a trophy or a bottle of champagne, but there have also been podiums I got where I wasn’t actually completely satisfied with how I drove.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The high will never be as high, and finishing fourth in Monza, a huge result, I still wasn’t standing on the podium, so I am not going out running around the streets naked,  but as far as my personal fulfilment, that is really everything I need if I leave the track knowing I got everything out of it.”</i>
