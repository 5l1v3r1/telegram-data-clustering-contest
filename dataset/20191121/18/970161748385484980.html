      <p>A child abuser squeezed a screaming baby’s face for almost two minutes in a bid to get the infant to quieten down, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Jonathon Rodriguez, 29, reportedly attacked the infant after being left with the three month-old by her mother in Pasco County, Florida, on October 24.</p>
      <p>Asked about the abuse, Rodriguez allegedly told deputies from Pasco County Sheriff’s Office: ‘I have never been so frustrated in my life.’</p>
      <p>He is said to have told deputies how he held the baby for 90 seconds to two minutes before letting go and saying ‘Please just stop, just stop!’</p>
      <p>The baby cried for another 20 minutes before calming down.</p>
      <p>When the mother returned six hours later, she confronted Rodriguez about newly-formed bruises on her baby’s face.</p>

      <p>He initially denied any knowledge of them.</p>
      <p>The mother was unconvinced, and took the baby to hospital.</p>
      <p>Doctors told her the little girl had not been seriously injured, but the mother was so upset she then took the baby to Pasco’s Kid’s First Protection Team.</p>
      <p>Staff there confirmed the baby had been abused, according to the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article237618059.html">Miami Herald</a>.</p>
      <p>They said: ‘This is a non-accidental inflicted injury and represents physical abuse…</p>
      <p>‘The history is concerning in that the child was truck or grabbed with such force that bruises were left to the area.’</p>
      <p>Deputies from Pasco County Sheriff’s Office then spoke to Rodriguez, who denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>He was arrested on Wednesday, and then admitted causing the bruises, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Rodriguez has now been charged with child abuse.</p>
