      <h1>Hearts sporting director hunt latest as Austin MacPhee is left in limbo</h1>
      <h2>The caretaker boss is a candidate to be the new sporting director at Tynecastle.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:17:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Caretaker manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/austin-macphee">Austin MacPhee</a> faces an anxious wait to see if he has won the race to become Hearts sporting director.</p>
      <p>Craig Levein's former assistant doesn't look set to continue in the dugout, but is in the running to land the top job at Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>But reports that claimed MacPhee has been told he will land the role are premature.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understands <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> has yet to begin interviewing for the sporting director job, a role which has been newly created after Levein left his role as director of football following his removal as manager.</p>

      <p>Interviews for the position are likely to start next week as the hunt to find the club’s next head coach takes precedence.</p>
      <p>A raft of candidates are in contention to become manager including Daniel Stendel.</p>
      <p>But as the German is still under contract at Barnsley despite being sacked, there are financial complications with appointing the 45-year-old.</p>
      <p>Motherwell boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stephen-robinson">Stephen Robinson</a> emerged as the early frontrunner but it’s believed an approach has still not been made.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old is also in the running for the Northern Ireland job, with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/michael-oneill">Michael O’Neill</a> ready to concentrate on Stoke City.</p>
