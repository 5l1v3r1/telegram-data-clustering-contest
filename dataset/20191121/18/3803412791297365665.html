      <p>One of the greatest moments of pride and happiness for any Pok√©mon player is stumbling across a <a href="https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-how-catch-shiny-pokemon">shiny Pok√©mon</a>. These alternately-colored creatures give you serious boasting rights, and they look super cool to boot. The thing is, shinies are super rare. However, there are a few different ways to significantly increase your chances of getting a shiny, one of which is by getting the Shiny Charm. Here's what you need to do to obtain it.</p>
      <h3>How to get the Shiny Charm</h3>
      <h4>Complete the Pok√©dex</h4>

      <p>The Shiny Charm is a reward that's given to you after you've completed the Galar region Pok√©dex. That means you'll need to have caught and registered all 400 Pok√©mon from the Sword and Shield games. This is a challenging feat as some Pok√©mon are exclusive to Sword, and others are exclusive to Shield.</p>
      <p>You'll need to <a href="https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-how-trade-pokemon">trade Pok√©mon</a> with players that own the opposite version if you hope to catch them all.</p>
      <h4>Talk to the man at the Circhester hotel</h4>

      <p>Once you've completed the Pok√©dex, travel to Circhester. Take a right immediately upon entering the city, and you'll see a building with several flags hanging from it. This is the Hotel Ionia. Enter the building and take the elevator up a floor.</p>
      <p>Now head to the room on the far left of the building. Inside you'll find a few different people. Head to the back and talk to the man dressed like a tired doctor. You might recognize him as the man who gave you the Catching Charm earlier in the game. Upon verifying that you've completed the Pok√©dex, he'll hand over the Shiny Charm.</p>
      <p>Make sure you go into your inventory and give the Shiny Charm to a Pok√©mon in your party to hold. Once this is done, your chances of seeing a shiny go up from 1/4096 to 1/458. That increases the odds quite a bit!</p>
      <h3>Catch all the shinies!</h3>
      <p>Now that you know how to get the Shiny Charm, it's time to work on completing your Pok√©dex. Don't forget to head to the hotel in Circhester once you've caught them all. I'm personally trying super hard to find a shiny Wooloo. It has black fleece instead of white fleece, and it's adorable! Good luck with your shiny hunting, and let us know if you catch any!</p>
