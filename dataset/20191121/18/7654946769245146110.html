      <h1>Record number of NYC high school grads are heading to college</h1>

      <p>More city public high school graduates are heading to college than ever with nearly two-thirds heading to college, Mayor de Bill Blasio announced Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A record 48,782 high school graduates in 2018 — 62 percent of the class — are heading to higher education, DOE stats show.</p>
      <p>“This idea would have been considered impossible not so long ago in New York City, but it’s happening now,” Hizzoner said at the Brooklyn announcement, where he was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/group-backing-specialized-high-school-exams-calls-richard-carranza-thin-skinned/">joined by Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza</a>.</p>
      <p>The two spoke at the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology in Bay Ridge, where a whopping 82 percent of its 2018 seniors went on to college.</p>
      <p>Carranza credited de Blasio’s “equity and excellence” agenda for public schools as the key factor in driving up the numbers.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t matter what your zip code is,” he added. “It doesn’t matter where you’re from. All that matters is what you want to do. “</p>
      <p>In 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, only about 50 percent of New York City’s public high school graduates went on to college.</p>
      <p>De Blasio said he expected two-thirds of graduating seniors to head straight to college on average by the time he leaves office in 2021.</p>
      <p>Data for all 2019 graduates is not yet available.</p>
