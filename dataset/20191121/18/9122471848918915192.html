      <h1>ESPN’s Prediction For Sunday’s Cowboys-Patriots Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:06:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The NFL season is starting to heat up as the holiday season is nearly upon us. Super Bowl contenders are starting to emerge – two of them being the New England Patriots and Dallas Cowboys.</p>
      <p>The Patriots and Cowboys are set to meet this Sunday in a regular season contest. New England is 9-1 this season. Tom Brady hasn’t skipped a beat despite his age. But offensive concerns are starting to arise as Brady has limited weapons in the passing game.</p>
      <p>As for Dallas, Dak Prescott has certainly improved his play. But inconsistency on both sides of the ball has led to a 6-4 start through 10 games. Give the Cowboys’ talent, one could argue that’s an underwhelming record.</p>
      <p>We’ll find out who’s for real on Sunday afternoon when Dallas and New England battle it out in Foxboro. While many expect a close contest, ESPN thinks otherwise.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ESPN’s Matchup Predictor gives the Patriots a 70.4 percent chance to beat the Cowboys on Sunday. The Cowboys have just a 29.4 percent to come away victorious. </b>
      </p>
      <p>That’s certainly more lopsided than most are expecting. But given the Patriots’ track record of success in big games, it’s not all too surprising.</p>
      <p>Cowboys-Patriots kicks off this Sunday at 4:25 p.m. ET. The game will be televised on FOX.</p>
