      <p>It has been indicated to the Siya crew that there could be a tussle for a return to the PSL for Allan Kateregga – the midfielder who previously played for Cape Town City and Maritzburg United in Mzansi's top flight. </p>
      <p>The Ugandan is plying his trade in Iraq, having secured a move to Erbil Sport Club in September. </p>

      <p>The 25-year-old is said to be on the radar of both Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, as reported in edition 1150 of Soccer Laduma, with the player’s representative confirming interest from the Absa Premiership, though he wouldn’t commit on the names of clubs as yet. </p>

      <p>While Siya sources have revealed that both Chiefs and Pirates are tracking the attack-minded player’s progress, all that his representative Samuel Celubra has said so far is, “The boy is wanted by clubs, and we have a few in South Africa that are looking at him. It’s the top clubs. He is available! His contract is ending in June next year and we hope for the best move for him. He loves the PSL, and if we get a good deal, we shall go with it.” </p>
      <p>According to sources, there is also interest from Europe for the services of the Ugandan international.</p>
