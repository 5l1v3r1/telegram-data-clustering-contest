      <p>In a rematch of the D7 championship from one year ago, the Black Hawk/Warren IL Warriors got the best of Edgar yet again 6-0.</p>
      <p>This game was much different than the 22-15 result from last year.</p>
      <p>It was all about the defense Thursday afternoon, as the Warriors held Edgar to 141 total yards. Of the Wildcats’ 12 possessions, seven ended in punts, two ended with a turnover, and the other three resulted in a turnover on downs.</p>
      <p>Black Hawk/Warren IL scored the game’s lone touchdown in the second quarter via a 30-yard pass from Ethan Williams to Cayden Milz.</p>
      <p>Williams threw for 102 yards, one touchdown and one interception on 9-of-16 passing.</p>
      <p>The Warriors’ most productive offensive player was Jaylen Rufenacht, who rushed the ball 18 times for 101 yards, a 5.6 average per carry.</p>
      <p>With six minutes to play in the fourth quarter, Edgar faced a fourth-and-2 from inside the Warriors’ 30-yard line. The ruling on the field was Edgar got enough for the first down but a replay review — new to WIAA football this year – reversed the call, and Black Hawk/Warren IL took over on downs.</p>
      <p>Edgar flirted with the end zone two more times late in the fourth quarter. A 33-yard touchdown reception by Drew Guden was erased due to a holding penalty, and another potential score fell through the hands of Brayden Baumgartner.</p>
      <p>Rufenacht sealed the victory with an interception with one minute to play, giving Black Hawk/Warren IL its third state championship since 2013.</p>
