      <p>An aide to Bloomberg told The Hill that the former New York City mayor has not made a final decision on launching a presidential bid, but noted that the filing was “another step towards running.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg ruled out a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination earlier this year but has renewed speculation of a presidential run in recent weeks by taking steps to get on the ballot in a handful of states, including Alabama, Arkansas and Tennessee. </p>
