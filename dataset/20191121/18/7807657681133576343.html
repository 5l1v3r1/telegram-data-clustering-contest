      <p>Lenovo's Yoga C940 comes in 14- and 15-inch flavors, though if you want to kit it out with the most powerful components available to the 2-in-1, you'll want to go with the largest size.</p>
      <p>

      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>10th Gen Intel CPUs available</li>
        <li>Beautiful 4K touch display option</li>
        <li>Soundbar hinge with full audio</li>
        <li>NVIDIA GTX 1650 GPU available</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Heavier</li>
        <li>More pricey</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Surface Pro X is the new ARM kid on the block, rocking a custom Qualcomm and Microsoft CPU. You can't choose a dedicated GPU and you must buy the keyboard cover separately, but it's a stunning form factor with LTE.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU71963YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fp%252Fsurface-pro-x%252F8vdnrp2m6hhc&amp;token=3I6JAEZY">From $999 at Microsoft</a>
      </p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>More affordable</li>
        <li>LTE as standard</li>
        <li>Up to 1TB storage</li>
        <li>Gorgeous design</li>
        <li>Seriosuly thin and light</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No dedicated GPU</li>
        <li>No Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</li>
        <li>ARM has some limitations</li>
        <li>No included pen or keyboard</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lenovo charges a premium for the Yoga C940, especially the 15-inch mode, which can not only house a powerful Intel Core i9 processor, but also a dedicated NVIDIA GPU. If you'd rather pick up a tablet with LTE, the Surface Pro X is a solid option for frequent travellers.</p>

      <h3>Design &amp; features</h3>

      <p>Unlike the Surface Pro 7, which saw no notable changes to its design compared to previous generations, Microsoft switched up the design of the Surface Pro X to tease what's to come for future Surface Pro hardware. The Pro X comes rocking a thinner chassis that's lighter than the high-end Surface Pro 7. You've still got the familiar kickstand on the rear, however.</p>
      <p>While optional, the Type Cover for the Surface Pro X has a special holder for the Surface Slim Pen, which you'd also need to purchase as an additional accessory. The excellent rear webcam is capable of 4K video, while the front-facing IR cam is meant for calls and Windows Hello.</p>
      <p>Both the 14- and 15-inch Yoga C940 from Lenovo are fairly similar to one another, and like the Surface Pro X rock a unibody aluminum design. Since these are more like laptops than tablets, you have a convertible hinge that allows you to rotate the display to enjoy tent, stand, and tablet modes. The hinge also houses a soundbar, which is a neat uses of space. There's no IR camera on the Yoga C940, but instead a fingerprint reader.</p>
      <p>The Surface Pro X comes with two USB-C ports, but lacks USB-A and a 3.5mm headphone jack. A highlight feature of the Pro X is the ARM processor from Qualcomm, which has support for an LTE modem. This capability allows you to get connected when out of Wi-Fi range, so long as you have cell signal. The Yoga C940 wins in the ports department with the inclusion of two Thunderbolt 3, one USB-A 3.1, and a 3.5mm audio jack. That's not amazing, but does allow you to connect most of your hardware and accessories.</p>
      <h3>Display</h3>
      <p>For the display, the Surface Pro X comes with a touch display with a screen resolution of 2880x1920 (267 PPI) at a 3:2 aspect ratio. The 14-inch Lenovo Yoga C940 display comes in either FHD anti-glare with 400 nits brightness, FHD glossy with 400 nits brightness, FHD anti-glare with 500 nits brightness, or UHD 4K glossy with HDR400. For the best picture possible, you'll want to go with the 4K option, but keep in mind the price will rise, and battery life will drop accordingly.</p>
      <p>If you're after a larger laptop, the 15.6-inch model comes with either a FHD or 4K display with HDR400 and Dolby Vision support. Both of these panels are glossy, but can throw out a lot of light with a rating of 500 nits. In either case, you're getting a beautiful display, but the larger model will make substantial productivity just a bit easier thanks to the increased screen real estate.</p>
      <h3>Performance &amp; price</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The Lenovo Yoga C940 is a powerful laptop and can be configured with a dedicated NVIDIA GTX 1650 GPU and up to a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 processor (15-inch only), or newer 10th Gen without the dedicated GPU (14-inch only). The ARM processor in the Surface Pro X isn't slow by any means and is often cmpared to an 8th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, but if you're all about intensive apps and tasks, you'll want to go with the Lenovo C940.</p>
      <p>Because of the more capable hardware, the Yoga C940 costs considerably more than the Surface Pro X. While it does come with superior internals, the Surface Pro X is designed more for those who are frequently on the road. LTE and true portability often means more than outright performance. These two devices target two different user groups.</p>
      <p>If you're on a tighter budget, the Surface Pro X starts from $999. The most affordable Lenovo Yoga C940 costs considerably more at $1,150.</p>
      <h3>The Yoga C940 is a more powerful 2-in-1 laptop</h3>
      <p>Lenovo's Yoga C940 is a pricey 2-in-1, but that's because you can configure it with some excellent hardware, including an Intel Core i9 processor as well as a dedicated NVIDIA GPU. The smaller 14-inch is a little more portable, but can keep up with any task you throw its way.</p>

      <p>The ARM-powered Surface Pro X won't match up performance-wise with the higher-end Yoga C940 models, but LTE connectivity, longer battery life, and a slimmer body make it easy to take with you wherever you go. A smart new storage system for a slimmer pen is an attractive addition, and two USB-C ports offer decent connectivity.</p>
