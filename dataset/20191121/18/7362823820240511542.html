      <p>"[Russia] removed even dome lights, sockets, and toilet bowls," he said according to a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50501241?ocid=socialflow_twitter">BBC</a> report.</p>
      <p>Russia’s Federal Security Service denied the allegations, saying that the ships – two gunboats and a tug – were returned in “normal condition and with good plumbing,” the report continued.</p>

      <p>The three ships were seized after Russia claimed they had violated procedures for transiting the Kerch Strait, while the Ukrainians said they were traveling in international waters.</p>
      <p>The Russian coast guard fired shots, then captured the ships and their crew of 24 Ukrainian sailors. The sailors were detained for 10 months and returned home in September as part of a prisoner exchange.</p>
