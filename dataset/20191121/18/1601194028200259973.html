      <h3>Match details</h3>
      <p><b>Fixture:</b> <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/golden-state-warriors">Golden State Warriors</a> vs <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/utah-jazz">Utah Jazz</a></p>
      <p><b>Date &amp; Time:</b> Saturday, 22 November 2019, 9:00 pm ET.</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Vivint Smart Home Arena, Salt Lake, UT.</p>
      <h3>Last game results</h3>
      <p><b>Golden State Warriors (3-13):</b> 94-142 loss to the Dallas Mavericks (Wednesday, 20 November 2019)</p>
      <p><b>Utah Jazz (9-5):</b> 103-95 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves (Wednesday, 20 November 2019)</p>
      <h3>Golden State Warriors Preview</h3>
      <p>The 2019-20 season might be the best thing for the future of the Golden State Warriors. General manager Bob Myers is likely to be selecting a top 10 draft pick at the 2020 NBA Draft. With Eric Paschall, a healthy Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, 2020-21 may be a stellar year for Golden State.</p>
      <p>At the moment though, the team are expected to continue suffering, as they did Wednesday night in Dallas. The Warriors were outscored 74 -38 in the first half and shot 38.9 percent for the game and under 30 percent from three-point range.</p>
      <h3>Key Player – Eric Paschall</h3>

      <p>Eric Paschall is the beneficiary of all the injuries plaguing the Golden State Warriors. Drafted 41st overall in the 2019 NBA draft, Paschall has been playing well for the Warriors; in 15 games, he is averaging 31.3 minutes and 17.1 points a game as a rookie.</p>
      <p>Even in the blowout loss to the Mavericks, Paschall was a reliable scorer for the Warriors as he racked up 22 points.</p>
      <h3>Warriors predicted lineup</h3>
      <p>Glen Robinson III, Alec Burks, Eric Paschall, Omari Spellman, Willie Cauley-Stein</p>
      <h3>Utah Jazz Preview</h3>
      <p>14 games into the 2019-20 season, the Utah Jazz are a respectable 9-5. They are 6-4 in their last 10 games and 6-1 at home.</p>
      <p>Utah knocked off the Minnesota Timberwolves Wednesday night 103-95. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 30 points for the Jazz and Donovan Mitchell scored 26 to ensure the win.</p>
      <p>The Jazz took care of the ball, committing only 11 turnovers, and shot a solid 42 percent from three-point range.</p>
      <h3>Key Player – Bojan Bogdanovic</h3>

      <p>Bojan Bogdanovic has been splendid for the Utah Jazz. He has provided the Jazz with a second 20-plus point scorer with an average of 20.5 points, behind only Donovan Mitchell’s 24.9 points a game.</p>
      <p>Since Utah only average 104 points a game, Bogdanovic’s scoring eases the pressure on Mitchell and Rudy Gobert offensively. Bogdanovic is also shooting 45.5 percent from beyond the three-point arc, allowing the Jazz to space the floor and create more room for Mitchell to attack the basket or Gobert to work in the post.</p>
      <h3>Jazz predicted lineup</h3>
      <p>Mike Conley Jr., Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Rudy Gobert, Royce O’Neale</p>
      <h3>Warriors vs Jazz Match Prediction</h3>
      <p>The misery does not end for the Warriors as Draymond Green is the latest regular to be held out of the lineup for injury reasons. The Warriors are 2-8 in their last 10 games and just 2-7 when playing on the road.</p>
      <p>They are averaging 108 points a game, but with the latest injuries to D’Angelo Russell and Draymond Green, it's expected that that number will drop - as evidenced by the blowout loss to Dallas Wednesday, when the Warriors managed just 94 points.</p>
      <p>The Utah Jazz are not an explosive offensive team, averaging just 104 points a game. But the Warriors are decimated by injuries and will struggle to keep pace, making the Jazz's job easier.</p>
      <p>The Jazz value each possession every game, as they have committed just 53 turnovers in the last five. They are 6-1 at home this season and should win their seventh against the Warriors Friday night.</p>
