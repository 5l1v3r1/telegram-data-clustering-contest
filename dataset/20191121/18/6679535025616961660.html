      <p>B.T. Rudresh said on Thursday that he became a successful homoeopath because he knew “what not to do” rather than “what to do” in his field.</p>
      <p>Delivering a talk on “Homoeopathy for Tomorrow,” a programme organised by Alva’s Homoeopathy Medical College at Moodbidri, Dr. Rudresh said people are not fools and are result oriented.</p>
      <p>He claimed that homoeopathy was the most efficient medication system for any ailment that has the ability to go to the cause of any health issue by providing relief through addressing the aberration, the initiation point of any disease.</p>
      <p>He told young homoeopaths that they should learn and practices well, not run after money or other gimmicks. “My hands-on experience in a Mumbai hospital and teaching experience at Government Homoeopathy Medical College provided me an overall perspective of this field,” he added.</p>
      <p>Dr. Rudresh further said while his generation could see only what was visible, the present generation has the potential to look behind their sight and explore more in homoeopathy.</p>
      <p>Alva’s Education Foundation trustee Vivek Alva said a proper propagation of the homoeopathic system should happen from every homoeopathy practitioner.</p>
      <p>Faculties and doctors should work upon homoeopathic research to demonstrate its effectiveness, both to medical and scientific community, he added. He told the students, “We should know where exactly learning happens, and this process should not be stopped till our death.”</p>
      <p>On the occasion, the second phase of addressing malnutrition among anganwadi students, initiated by Alva’s Homoeopathy Medical College, was inaugurated while Dr. Rudresh was felicitated.</p>
      <p>College principal Pravinraj Alva, vice-principal Herald Roshan Pinto, assistant administrative officer Prajna Alva, and others were present.</p>
