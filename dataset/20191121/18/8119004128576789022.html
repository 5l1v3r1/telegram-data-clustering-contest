      <p>The pink-ball Test is scheduled to start at 1:30pm at the iconic Eden Gardens stadium.</p>
      <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally invited his Bangladesh counterpart to attend the inaugural event of the match.</p>
      <p>A special flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines carrying the prime minister and her entourage will take off from Shahjalal International Airport at 10am on Friday.</p>
      <p>It will land at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport Kolkata at 10:25am (Indian time).</p>
      <p>After the ceremonial events at the airport, Hasina will go to Hotel Taj Bengal Kolkata where she will be staying during her brief visit.</p>
      <p>Later, she along with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will go to the Eden Gardens and ring the bell to start the Test around 12:30pm (local time).</p>
      <p>After watching the first session of the second Test, the prime minister will return to her hotel.</p>
      <p>At the end of the first day's match, she will attend a cultural event organised by the Cricket Association of Bengal at the stadium ground.</p>
