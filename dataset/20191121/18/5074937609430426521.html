      <h1>NCCE/GNA join forces to educate public on Referendum</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:44:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:44</time> by <a rel="author">Isaac Newton Tetteh, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov. 21, GNA - The Ghana News Agency (GNA), Tema Regional Office on Wednesday pledged to support the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), Tema Metro directorate to intensify public sensitisation on the forthcoming District Level Elections (DLE) and referendum.</p>
      <p>Mr. Francis Ameyibor, GNA Tema Regional Manager explained that as the national wire service, the Agency was obligated to help state institutions especially Governance bodies such as the NCCE perform its functions.</p>
      <p>Mr Ameyibor stated this during a working visit by Mr Isaac Kwame Antwi NCCE Tema Metro Director to the GNA.</p>
      <p>He said the GNA and the NCCE were horizontal partners and would ensure that they worked hand in hand to educate the Ghanaian voter as far as the District Level Elections and the referendum was concern.</p>
      <p>He said it was not prudent for such national institutions especially governance bodies and the state media to take a stance on the referendum but must educate the voter to make the right decision when they mount the polling both to vote come December 17 2019.</p>
      <p>Mr Ameyibor, noted that through the initiative of the GNA General Manager, Mr Albert Kofi Owusu, the agency was cultivating a more entrepreneurial climate to help it compete against other news suppliers and to identify new market opportunities.</p>
      <p>He said the nurture of a new professional culture, adoption of different news model, the reconstruction of ‘brand identity’, forging strategic alliances; foresight in the provision of incentives and rewards for workers, and a re-definition of the range of activities that were proper to national agencies, was critical for the forward march of the agency.</p>
      <p>He assured the NCCE, that in line with “our mission to serve the information needs of the nation as a whole, “we will support through our news medium the Referendum and District Level and Unit Committee Level Elections.</p>
      <p>“We are providing you a platform noted for its accurate and objective reportage, which will accelerate the public education and also reduce the incidence of mis-information, and distortion of facts”.</p>
      <p>Mr Ameyibor said GNA served as communication tools for national development and a vehicle that offered positive or at least balanced images for international consumption; “GNA is your partner for national development count on us”.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwame Antwi, expressed gratitude to the GNA for the willingness to support the effort of the NCCE especially in public education towards the referendum and DLE.</p>
      <p>The NCCE Metro Director further stated that the commission was handicapped in resources, but was doing all it could to whip up the interests of Ghanaians to participate in the District Level Elections and the referendum.</p>
      <p>“We have met Faith-Based Organisations; Women groups amongst other organisations to educate them on the referendum and we consider GNA as major stakeholder, therefore we welcome the partnership,” he noted.</p>
      <p>According to the Tema NCCE boss, the commission hyped activities on the December 17 referendum. It is our priority activity now, to ensure active citizen participation and a higher turn out during the election.</p>
      <p>The NCCE explained that the Referendum was asking the citizens a simple question; “do you want political parties’ participation in the District Level Elections: YES or NO”.</p>
      <p>The Referendum is only about Ghanaians voting either YES to allow Political Parties to participate in DLE, or NO to let the status quo prevail, where political parties do not participate in DLE.</p>
