      <p>An elite Ukrainian police unit has apprehended a suspected 30-year-old member of the Islamic State (IS) extremist group in the Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv.<br/><br/>The Russian citizen was detained based on an Interpol notice related to murder and was hiding in Ukraine to evade arrest, the National Police <b><a href="https://www.npu.gov.ua/news/rozshuk/u-zhitomiri-policzejski-zatrimali-rozshukovanogo-Interpolom-inozemczya/">said in a statement</a></b> on November 21.<br/><br/>The unnamed suspect was born in the easternmost Ukrainian region of Luhansk but had lived in Russia for an extended period.<br/><br/>"According to reports, the detainee is a member of the terrorist radical organization Islamic State and even the leader of one of its groups," the police said.<br/><br/>"By ethnicity, he is Daghestani, but was born in the Luhansk region of Ukraine. He lived in Russia for a long time. He was hiding in the territory of our country in order to avoid responsibility for murder."<br/><br/>Last week, Ukrainian authorities, in coordination with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Georgia’s Interior Ministry, detained Al-Bara Shishani, a top IS commander.<br/><br/>The Georgian national had served as a deputy to Abu Omar al-Shishani, the man the Pentagon has described as the militant group's "minister of war."<br/><br/>After the latter was killed in 2016, Al-Bara Shishani fled to Turkey and in 2018 used a fake passport to enter Ukraine, where he continued to coordinate IS activities, Ukraine’s State Security Service (SBU) said.<br/><br/>He was detained in the Kyiv region near a private home where he resided, the SBU said.</p>
