      <p><i>InvestorPlace</i> contributor Ian Bezek hit the nail on the head in his Nov. 19 column when he suggested <b>JD.com </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/jd-stock-quote/"><b><u>JD</u></b></a>) was worth buying after its monster earnings beat. </p>

      <p>Despite <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/grab-jd-stock-while-the-market-snoozes-despite-its-blowout-earnings/">JD’s blowout third quarter,</a> JD.com has lost almost 10% of its value since announcing its results. I guess that’s why they say, “Buy on the rumor, sell on the news!” </p>
      <p>In early September, I suggested that JD.com was <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/09/jd-stock-has-a-clear-shot-at-50/">a $50 stock disguised as a $30 stock</a>. Looking at a few key points from its Q3 results, I believe it could hit $50 as soon as next December. </p>
      <p>Of course, as I said in September, that won’t happen without a permanent, all-encompassing trade deal between the U.S. and China. Until then, as Bezek, the other <i>InvestorPlace</i> contributor, argued, investors can buy JD shares at a serious discount. </p>
      <p>Take advantage of investors’ uncertainty while you still can.</p>
      <h3>Free Cash Flow Positive</h3>
      <p>Bezek pointed out that JD.com’s financial results continue to strengthen. </p>
      <p>Its free cash flow, one of my favorite financial metrics, was $8.8 million in Q3, up almost 108% from a year ago. The company will finish the year with nice top-line growth, bottom-line profits, and free cash flow up the wazoo. In a lot of respects, JD is starting to experience a trajectory not dissimilar from that of <b>Amazon </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amzn-stock-quote/"><b><u>AMZN</u></b></a>). </p>
      <p>That’s a very good thing. Now back to the FCF situation.</p>
      <p>From September 2018 to  September 2019, JD.com had <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1549802/000119312519293846/d824217dex991.htm">FCF of $2.2 billion</a>, considerably higher than the negative FCF of $774.7 million that it had in the previous 12 months and the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1549802/000119312519220652/d775597dex991.htm">$1.0 billion of FCF</a> it reported between June 2018  and June 2019. Both sequentially and year-over-year, JD is becoming far more profitable.</p>
      <p>What will its full-year 2019 FCF be? If I had to hazard a guess, I’d go with $3.4 billion.</p>
      <p>If that’s the case, its FCF yield would be 8.1%, based on an <a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ev/JD/Enterprise-Value/JDcom-Inc">enterprise value of $42.0 billion</a>.</p>
      <p>From where I sit, that puts it in value territory.</p>
      <p>JD has enough free cash flow to eliminate all of its debt. That provides it with considerable financial flexibility.</p>
      <h3>JD’s Customer Base Continues to Grow</h3>
      <p>From the end of Q3 of 2018 to the end of Q3 of 2019, the number of JD’s active customer accounts increased 4.1% to 334.4 million. </p>
      <p>Through the first nine months of fiscal 2019, JD’s retail unit had $55.9 million of sales. Annualized over 12 months, that’s $74.5 billion or $222.79 per active customer account. In the first nine months of 2018, on an annualized basis, that’s $59.2 billion or $184.40 per active customer.  </p>
      <p>This means that not only did JD.com increase the number of active customer accounts by an average of 4% each quarter, but the amount they spent rose by an average of 21% per quarter. </p>
      <p>With its retail business solidly profitable, it can afford to take chances on its new businesses, which currently aren’t profitable, but should be by the end of fiscal 2020. </p>
      <h3>The Bottom Line on JD Stock</h3>
      <p>From every angle, JD.com has become one of the most successful retailers in China. </p>
      <p>Back in 2018, I had lost confidence in JD.com and its CEO and founder Richard Li because of allegations that Liu  raped a woman while he was traveling on business in the U.S. Since Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman decided not to charge the executive in December 2018, JD.com has risen by 50%. </p>
      <p>By the end of 2020, I expect it to jump by another 50%, bringing it close to $50.</p>
      <p>JD.com is one of the best $30 stocks currently available. </p>
