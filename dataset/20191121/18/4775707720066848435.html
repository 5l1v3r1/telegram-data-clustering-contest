      </h4>
      <blockquote>Take control of the building and running of a maximum-security prison as the critically acclaimed lock-em-up arrives on Xbox One! Your Design, Their Fate Will you build and manage a prison to create social order where it’s failed in the past, offering rehabilitation and peaceful coexistence amongst inmates? Will your prison disregard human rights, impose intentional harshness and be devoid of any notions of wellbeing and freedom? The choice is yours. In Prison Architect, you will see the impact of your grand design on the lives of your inmates; be it a utopic centre for rehabilitation, a brutal Super Max Prison or anything in between. Even when all of your prisoners’ needs are met, remember one thing - it’s still a prison, and no one really wants to be there. Start your journey into the world of Prison Architect by playing through the Prison Stories (campaign). Here you’ll learn the ropes by being brought in to equip a small prison with everything it needs to perform its first execution, all before being called up to deal with emergencies at larger and larger prisons. You’ll quickly learn how to cope with blazing infernos, hostage situations and prison wide riots - if you make it through all that unscathed, the Mayor will be ready to give you the reigns of a brand new prison development where you can build the prison of your dreams. Build and Manage A Maximum Security Prison Once you are ready to begin building your own prison, in Architect Mode (sandbox) you can either choose to take control of one of several pre-built prisons right away or build one entirely from scratch. Acting as both architect and governor, you control every detail of your Prison - from building new cells and facilities to hiring staff and creating reform programs - all while dealing with informants, contraband smuggling, gang warfare, full-scale riots and more! Once your prison is built, go online with World of Wardens to share your designs with the community. You can also browse and play other Architects’ prisons from around the world!</blockquote>
      <p>The achievement list for <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/products/321/Prison-Architect-Xbox-One-Edition">Prison Architect: Xbox One Edition</a> is again a tough one if you're looking to boost your Gamerscore for a free this weekend. It's unlikely you're going to get many achievements in the time you have, and you're more than likely going to tank your completion percentage. However, Prison Architect is still a fun game, and if you're not worried about your completion percentage, it's worth checking out.</p>
