      <p>The eagle has landed at a popular tourist spot in Germany – thanks to help from a business in Devon.</p>
      <p>The 450,000 people who flock to the picture book town of Triberg, in the heart of the Black Forest, every year are now being greeted by a sculpture of an eagle, which points the way to a new birds of prey zoo nearby.</p>
      <p>The unique work was created by sculptors Gary and Thomas Thrussell, a family artists team from Bodmin Moor, Cornwall.</p>
      <p>And as the steel sculpture will stand in the open air, Gary called on South West Galvanizers, based in Crediton, to ensure the 2.5m-wide piece will stand the test of time.</p>
      <p>Gary made a 1,800-mile round trip to the town, which is in the south west region of Baden-Wurttemberg, to deliver the piece.</p>

      <p>He said: “A new bird of prey zoo featuring all types of eagles has been opened over there and I was commissioned by the owner to create unique artwork for it.</p>
      <p>“My son Thomas and I worked on it throughout the summer and we took it down to Germany ourselves in the van. Everyone there was delighted, including the Burgermeister.</p>
      <p>“We needed to ensure it will be protected from corrosion, so I took it to South West Galvanizers.”</p>
      <p>Gary was so pleased with the finish that he’s planning to submit the piece for annual awards run by the Galvanizers Association, and Tony Wonnacott, General Manager at South West Galvanizers, is backing him all the way.</p>
      <p>He said: “We’ve galvanized several pieces for Gary in the past, but this one was absolutely stunning and featured fantastic workmanship.</p>
      <p>“The eagle and its base were particularly intricate, so we put them through the process with great care and it came out really well.”</p>
