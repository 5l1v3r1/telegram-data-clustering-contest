      <p>A coal miner's daughter from County Durham has become the latest key witness in the Donald Trump impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Fiona Hill was brought up in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/">North East</a> but moved to the US after university to pursue a PhD in history at Harvard.</p>
      <p>She served as a White House analyst on Russia but grew alarmed by how Mr Trump and others in his orbit were conducting foreign policy in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>In her evidence on Thursday Ms Hill denounced as "fictional" the contention from some Republicans that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US election.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hill was an aide to national security adviser John Bolton but she stressed she is "nonpartisan" and has worked under Republican and Democratic presidents.</p>
      <p>In prepared opening remarks to the House Intelligence Committee, she also urged politicians not to "promote politically-driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests".</p>
      <p>She added: "I have no interest in advancing the outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction, except toward the truth."</p>
      <p>She said the conclusion by US intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the election "is beyond dispute".</p>
      <p>But she said the assertion by some Republicans that Ukraine interfered in the election "is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves".</p>
      <p>She added: "I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimise an alternative narrative that the Ukrainian government is a US adversary, and that Ukraine - not Russia - attacked us in 2016."</p>
      <p>Mrs Hill, who has a said US support for Ukraine, "which continues to face armed Russian aggression, has been politicised".</p>
      <p>In the past Mrs Hill, who has a "softened but noticeable" North East accent," has been a critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin and wrote a book called ‘ Mr Putin, Operative in the Kremlin’ a reference to his past in the KGB.</p>
      <p>Speaking about her background in 2016, Mrs Hill said: “My dad was a coal miner in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham</a> .</p>
      <p>“I have worked hard and emigrated to the US, and I think of myself as working-class but I’m probably not any more.</p>
      <p>“I applied to Oxford in the 80s and was invited to an interview.</p>
      <p>“It was like a scene from Billy Elliot : people were making fun of me for my accent and the way I was dressed.”</p>
      <p>“It was the most embarrassing, awful experience I had ever had in my life.”</p>
      <p>Appointing Mrs Hill, who has a daughter with fellow academic Kenneth Keen, was seen as a signal of Trump cooling his links with Russia after the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">President</a>  found his White House under pressure over apparent links to the country.</p>
