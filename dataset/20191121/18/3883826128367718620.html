        <b>The Conservatives have raised £5.7m in the first week of the official election campaign, according to the Electoral Commission.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tories received 87% of registered donations in that period, figures show, while Labour raised a total of £218,500.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems received £275,000, whilst the Brexit Party raised £250,000.</p>
      <p>But the figures do not represent all donations, as only those above £7,500 have to be reported.</p>
      <p>The biggest gift to the Tories was £1.5m from theatre producer and regular donor John Gore.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the largest single registered donation to Labour was £62,000 from the Unite union, led by Jeremy Corbyn ally Len McCluskey.</p>

      <p>BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the figures showed an "astonishing gap in fundraising".</p>
      <p>The discrepancy between the two main parties is even wider than in the first week of the 2017 campaign, when the Tories raised £4.1m in comparison to the £2.7m received by Labour.</p>
      <p>In addition, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said he understood the Conservatives had raised more than £4m in unregistered smaller donations since the beginning of the election campaign.</p>
      <p>This is four times the £1m in small donations - averaging £26 each - that Labour says it has received over the same period.</p>

      <p>In the first week of the current campaign, the Green Party raised £30,000 in registered donations - half the £60,000 raised by the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>This is the first UK-wide election when pre-poll donations and loan reports have been published for parties in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Money received during the other weeks of the five-week official election campaign will be detailed in later releases.</p>
      <p>For Labour, 70% of registered donations came from unions.</p>
      <p>For the Conservatives, 47% of the party's donations came from individuals, with the remainder coming from companies.</p>
      <p>The party received £500,000 from investment firm WA Capital and the same from property company Countywide Developments.</p>
      <p>Another Tory donor, Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former minister for Russian President Vladimir Putin, gave £200,000 in the same period.</p>
      <p>The biggest donor to the Lib Dems was wealth management firm Attestor Services, which gave £75,000.</p>
      <p>Financier Jeremy Hosking, a former donor to the Vote Leave campaign, was the biggest donor to the Brexit Party with £250,000.</p>
