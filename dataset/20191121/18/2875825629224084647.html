      <h1>Leaky QPR are 17/4 to keep a clean sheet against Championship rival's Fulham</h1>
      <h2>Can Mark Warburton's side grab that elusive clean sheet at Craven Cottage this weekend?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:08:34+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Championship rivals QPR and Fulham meet for the 38th time in their history this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Pools are running a special on QPR to keep a clean sheet at 17/4. Something the side has failed to achieve all season in the league.</p>
      <p>QPR, managed by Mark Warburton, are 10th in the Championship and two points behind their rivals.</p>
      <p>However, they have a far inferior goal difference of -4 and have not kept a clean sheet against their west London neighbours since February 2000 in a 0-0 draw.</p>
      <p>But as we all know in football, stranger things have happened - I mean, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> are in the Premier League!</p>
      <p>So QPR's defence hold out for a full 90 minutes and get that elusive clean sheet?</p>
