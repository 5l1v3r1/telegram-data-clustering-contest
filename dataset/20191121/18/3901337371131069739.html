      <p>Dortmund's 15-year-old wonderkid Youssoufa Moukoko celebrated his birthday in style on Wednesday after receiving a gift from Messi, a player he has previously named as his idol. </p>
      <p>The Cameroon-born German youth international posted an image on his official Instagram account showing off the boxed gift he had received from Messi this week.</p>
      <p>Moukoko is widely regarded as one of football's hottest young talents, and recently became the youngest player ever to score in the UEFA Youth League.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, <i>Soccer Laduma</i> <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/bundesliga-news/exclusive-interview-jorg-heinrich-borussia-dortmund-assistant-manager/666881">spoke to BVB assistant manager Jorg Heinrich</a>, who reserved praise for the club's burgeoning talent. </p>
      <p>"There are very few players who can play the way he (Moukoko) does and skip through the youth teams," the 49-year-old shared.</p>
      <p>"I'm convinced that if he continues to develop as he has done since joining Dortmund, then he'll play for the first team one day.</p>
      <p>"As a player, you need physical attributes to compete with your teammates, so if you skip the youth teams you need to develop your physical attributes to be on par with your older teammates.</p>
      <p>"Here are some young players who play for the first team and he'll be motivated because he can see it's possible to get the chance to play for Dortmund."</p>
