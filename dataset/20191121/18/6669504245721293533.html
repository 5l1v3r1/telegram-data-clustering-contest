      <p>Getting the bus to the Village Green mall is soon to become easier.</p>
      <p>Construction is underway of a new transit exchange at the Village Green Shopping Centre and it's scheduled to see buses using it just before Christmas.</p>
      <p>According to a City of Vernon media release, four new bus stops with two shared bus shelters are being constructed near the southwest entrance to the mall's food court.</p>
      <p>“BentallGreenOak is pleased to be able to provide a dedicated facility that can be used as a transit exchange for riders either going to the Village Green Shopping Centre or transferring on to different bus routes,” Village Green Shopping Centre general manager Scott Adam said in the release.</p>
      <p>In 2016 bus stops were moved to 48 Avenue in due to safety concerns.</p>
      <p>"Historically, the transit exchange at Village Green Shopping Centre was one of the busiest bus stops in Vernon," Vernon Mayor Victor Cumming said in the release. "We have heard many requests for this service to return, increasing accessibility to these local businesses and providing an excellent transit exchange. Therefore, the City is pleased to financially support this project so transit and the exchange can be available at the Centre for many years to come."</p>
      <p>Bus service to the shopping mall will be re-introduced Dec. 22, with bus routes 3 Alexis Park and 9 North End stopping at the shopping centre.</p>
      <p>New schedule information will be available in December at <a href="https://www.bctransit.com/choose-transit-system">BCTransit.com.</a></p>
