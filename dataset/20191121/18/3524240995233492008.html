        <b>Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>Senate President Ahmad Lawan has expressed willingness to approve all requests that come to the Senate from President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p>Lawan said any request that comes from Buhari is “good for the nation” and the Senate will take immediate action on them.</p>
      <p>The Senate President said this when the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN), paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Sagay had appealed to the Senate President to ensure that Ibrahim Magu, acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, is confirmed as the substantive head of the agency.</p>
      <p>But the Senate president said there was no pending request for Magu’s confirmation, explaining that Magu had been rejected twice by the 8th Senate led by Bukola Saraki.</p>
      <p>“The confirmation of acting chairman of EFCC – there is no request before this Senate for the confirmation of the acting chairman of EFCC.</p>
      <p>“This is a new senate and therefore, until there is a request to this senate, there is nothing the senate can do.</p>
      <p>“I want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr. President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation and the senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.”</p>
      <p>The Senate President said the lawmakers are “in a haste” to pass anti-corruption bills.</p>
      <p>“As far as we are concerned, those bills will have to come again and start to go through the process from the very beginning,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We are ready; in fact, we are in haste if those bills are ready for us to start working on them.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Sagay, while making a case for Magu, said the acting EFCC chairman, has accomplished “magnificent work so far in the years of being in that position.”</p>
      <p>“We also want to bring before the Senate, some of the criticisms of the public in the area of oversight,” he said.</p>
