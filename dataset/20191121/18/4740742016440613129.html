      <h1>Revealed: The story behind Steve Hamer's exit and what it means for Bristol Rovers</h1>
      <h2>The experienced chairman has left the club after more than three years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:01:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:01</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>Perhaps the best example, displaying how Steve Hamer became an outcast at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers</a>, occurred during the 3-1 win over Oxford United on August 24.</p>
      <p>Having limped out of his <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/police-escorts-elbows-early-exit-3247997">return to the Mem after just 33 minutes</a> amid a cacophony of abuse, Matty Taylor elected to walk behind the family stand, attracting even more vitriol from fans, and then sit, on clear view to the Thatchers End, with the Rovers chairman to watch the remainder of the game.</p>
      <p>It was pure pantomime as Gasheads delighted in his misfortune and the victory, booing their villain relentlessly, but it also spoke volumes of Hamer's own position and decreasing connection with the club.</p>
      <p>Friends and former colleagues he and Taylor may have been, but in the context of that situation, and given the sheer level of hatred towards the former striker on that day, the optics for the chairman weren't great. Not that he especially cared.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Rovers <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-chairman-steve-hamer-3561377">parted company with the 68-year-old</a> - a decision that has been months in the making and has shined a light on the internal political disagreements that have blighted the club for too long.</p>
      <p>Hamer was summoned to London to meet with Hani Al-Qadi and was informed of the news, with the club's 15-word statement following less than 24 hours later. The brevity of those words as sure a sign of the feeling towards him as any.</p>
      <p>Hamer was appointed by Rovers in February 2016, replacing Nick Higgs and coinciding with the arrival of the Al-Qadi family.</p>
      <p>A vastly experienced, respected and well-connected "old school" football man, he could assist Wael and Hani Al-Qadi in making sound business and football decisions in a marketplace that was very new to the Jordanian family.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And that is how he was initially cast, as Wael Al-Qadi spoke with emotion and ambition, Hamer was often assigned to bring a dose of reality to the president's bold pronouncements.</p>
      <p>Hamer offered a clear picture surrounding the rise and fall of the UWE development and, to use football parlance, was seen as a safe pair of hands.</p>
      <p>However, increasingly that clashed with the Al-Qadis more idealised concepts of where the club should be heading, while the appointment of Martyn Starnes <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/martyn-starnes-bristol-rovers-plymouth-1358007">as CEO in March 2018</a> created a clear divide in the boardroom which has been apparent ever since.</p>
      <p>Hamer claims to have not known who Starnes was or what he was intending to do at the football club, until the former Plymouth executive first arrived at the Mem. He had been kept totally in the dark.</p>
      <p>And that confusion quickly led to tension between the two men and, eventually, a situation where the CEO and the chairman rarely spoke, barely even acknowledging another.</p>
      <p>When Wael Al-Qadi attends game at the Mem, it is Starnes who he either speak to beforehand or watches with in the president's box on the halfway line. Hamer, meanwhile, could be found in box No1 right down the other end of the West Stand with directors from the visiting team.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It has been a political divide that has come to unfortunately define Bristol Rovers and the overwhelming sentiment at the Mem in the wake of his departure is that it will now be a more "united" football club.</p>
      <p>The situation was workable to a point; day-to-day matters were still addressed, albeit with disagreements as in any business.</p>
      <p>But with the key players at a club so distanced and on dramatically different pages personally and professionally, it was nigh on impossible to form any kind of long-term strategy.</p>
      <p>From a fans' perspective, Hamer's waning influence could be evidenced by the decreasing number of interviews he conducted on the club's behalf which, to many, proved something of a relief.</p>
      <p>In August 2017, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-hamer-references-the-crazy-278135">when speaking to the BBC</a>, he infamously compared Rovers to Wimbledon's Crazy Gang of the 1980s.</p>
      <p>"They did everything in reverse didnâ€™t they. Their ground was appalling, they would turn up in an old beaten banger to away matches but I think if you have got the spirit and the unity, and if you have got, the commitment and the hunger in the camp to win football games that is what counts," he said.</p>
      <p>It's an analogy that stands up to an extent but was ultimately embarrassing to supporters and completely at odds with the image Wael Al-Qadi would prefer to project.</p>
      <p>Hamer was opposed to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/exclusive-bristol-rovers-appoint-new-2392341">the appointment of Graham Coughlan</a> as manager in January, especially when he was offered a two-and-a-half year contract despite limited experience in the role.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Given Coughlan's association with Starnes previously at Plymouth Argyle, it was seen as a nepotistic decision, irrespective of how well the Dubliner had performed as caretaker following Darrell Clarke's departure.</p>
      <p>Coughlan was acutely aware of this and the manager, like his CEO and eventually his president, is said to have had virtually no working relationship with the former chairman, barely speaking and to the point any emails from him remained unopened and ignored.</p>
      <p>What has brought these matters to a head has been the prospective takeover of the club which has been rumbling on for more than a year.</p>
      <p>Although his bridges were burned with Wael Al-Qadi and Starnes, Hamer had retained ties with Hani Al-Qadi, essentially the man making the primary financial decisions at the club.</p>
      <p>That, coupled with his EFL connections and overall experience of the mechanics of football, kept him in his job, despite the various personal and professional disagreements along the corridors of power.</p>
      <p>Crucially, he had also chosen to align himself with the consortium looking to purchase the Fruit Market site at St Phillip's Marsh.</p>
      <p>And while the Al-Qadi family remain open to that bid, which<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/gambling-fruit-market-only-way-3263436"> first needs to secure the land deal</a> before offering to buy the football club, they have no outward allegiances.</p>
      <p>There were suspicions that Hamer was planning a life for himself beyond Dwane Sports' ownership and that didn't sit well with the president.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The distance between the two factions could be seen in contract discussions with Jonson Clarke-Harris and his representatives; Wael Al-Qadi keen to reward his superstar forward for his efforts, Starnes open to the idea but also vigilant from an accountancy point of view, while Hamer was simply against it.</p>
      <p>Privately, Hamer has known his time was likely up for a while and it's been a matter of when rather than if, but <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/exclusive-proposed-stadium-site-fruit-3188701">the potential of a takeover on the horizon</a> has represented a pathway to remaining in north Bristol.</p>
      <p>However, such has been the climate behind the scenes and the complete breakdown in trust from all sides, it's surprising he has retained his position until November 2019.</p>
      <p>Given Hamer's closeness with the Fruit Market bid, the implication is that his exit now signifies that particular deal is off, with at least two other interested parties lurking in the background.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Live understands</a> that is fundamentally not the case and the consortium remain positive that an agreement can be made with Total Produce to purchase the 11-acre site before concluding a deal to buy the club.</p>
      <p>From the Al-Qadi's perspective, this is a power struggle they have emphatically won in the short-term, but the long-term future of Bristol Rovers remains as uncertain as ever.</p>
