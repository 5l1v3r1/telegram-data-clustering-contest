      <p>Defender Tommy Elphick is out after suffering a serious injury last time out, requiring surgery, and either of Terence Kongolo or Jon Gorenc Stankovic are his likely replacement.</p>
      <p>Jaden Brown is also a doubt having suffered an ankle injury and not travelled with the Huddersfield squad for a warm-weather training camp in Dubai over the international break.</p>
      <p>Full-back Danny Simpson is also a doubt, suffering a hip problem in the defeat to Preston, though he did make the trip to Dubai, according to the <a href="https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/sport/football/news/huddersfield-town-injury-list-danny-17292807">Huddersfield Examiner</a> .</p>
      <p>And striker Fraizer Campbell is also hoping to make a full recovery having missing the Terriers' last outing with a hamstring issue.</p>
      <p>On the plus side for Danny Cowley, midfielder Jonathan Hogg has returned from his one-match suspension.</p>
