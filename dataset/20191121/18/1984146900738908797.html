      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Holland</a></address>
      <p>Higher ticket prices on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tyne-and-wear-metro">Tyne and Wear Metro</a> will come into force in January, after being approved by councillors.</p>
      <p>The new fares will be introduced on January 2, with the cost of adult single or day tickets rising by 10p - but only 5p for those using Pop cards.</p>
      <p>Season ticket prices will increase by 3%, but fares for young people aged 18 and under are being frozen.</p>
      <p>Members of the North East Joint Transport Committee’s Tyne and Wear sub-committee agreed to the changes, which Metro operator Nexus says are needed to meet rising costs, on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Coun Joyce McCarty, deputy leader of Newcastle City Council, said: "None of us wants to see rises in fares, but we have to accept that costs are increasing."</p>
      <p>North Tyneside councillor Carl Johnson added that the clear message for passengers was to get a pay-as-you-go Pop card to benefit from cheaper ticket prices.</p>
      <p>Huw Lewis, Nexus customer services director, said that many passengers will see a real terms cut in the amount they pay for their Metro travel as a percentage of their income.</p>
      <p>Alongside the fare hikes, a new offer will allow up to three children aged 11 and under to travel for free at weekends when accompanied by a fare-paying adult.</p>
      <p>Committee chair Coun Gladys Hobson praised the impact that will have on parents and grandparents, saying: "It is a fantastic offer and I am sure that the public will welcome it."</p>
      <p>Mr Lewis added that the weekend offer “will be welcomed by families and make a real difference not just to Metro but to our towns and city centres”.</p>
      <p>He said: "Families are price conscious and that is why we want to provide them with value and bring families back onto the Metro."</p>
      <p>The cost of single and day tickets on the Shields Ferry is also due to increase by 10p.</p>
