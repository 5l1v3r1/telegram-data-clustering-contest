      <p>After more than 12 years, Valve has finally given fans a look at the future of the “Half-Life” series with a trailer for “Half-Life: Alyx.”</p>
      <p>Valve described “Half-Life Alyx” as the company’s “flagship VR game,” and it looks to offer an interesting spin on “Half-Life’s” first-person-shooter formula.</p>

      <p>Valve launched a first-party VR headset, the Valve Index, earlier this year, and “Half-Life: Alyx” will be available for free to all Valve Index owners when its released in March 2020. The game <a href="https://half-life.com/en/alyx/vr">will be available for purchase</a> on the Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest (if you tether it to a PC), HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.</p>
      <p>While Valve is best-known for operating Steam, the massively popular online gaming platform, the company was built on the success of the original “Half-Life.” The last game in the series, “Half-Life 2: Episode 2,” ended with a shocking cliffhanger back in 2007. Fans spent years asking Valve to offer a conclusion to the series, but their pleas went unanswered – until now.</p>

      <p>The “Half-Life” series has always been tied to major innovations in the PC gaming space. The first game was one of the most innovative video games of the 90s, pairing a flexible, innovative game design with a rich sci-fi horror story. The physics engine of “Half-Life” eventually became the basis for “CounterStrike” and “Team Fortress,” two of the most influential online shooting games of all time.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Source Engine developed for “Half-Life 2” has provided the foundation for a number of popular games over the last decade, including this year’s “Apex Legends.” “Half-Life 2” was also the first game to require Steam to install, introducing millions of players to a new type of online gaming platform. Steam has skyrocketed in popularity in the years sense, with more than 90 million monthly users.</p>
      <p>Though the virtual reality business isn’t exactly new, “Half-Life: Alyx” could spark fresh interest in an industry that has struggled to win over hardcore gamers. “Half-Life: Alyx” won’t offer an conclusion to the cliffhanger that has kept fans on edge for more than decade, but its exciting to see Valve return to the beloved franchise.</p>
