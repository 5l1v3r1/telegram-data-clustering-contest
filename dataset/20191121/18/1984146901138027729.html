      <h1>Kleberson on the difficulties facing a Brazilian with a huge price tag adapting to the Premier League</h1>
      <h2>The Manchester United flop has passed his verdict on Newcastle United forward Joelinton, while he was also asked about Miguel Almiron</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester United midfielder Kleberson is confident things will 'eventually work out' for Joelinton at Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>Joelinton joined the Magpies from Bundesliga side Hoffenheim for a club record fee in the summer but he has scored just once in his opening 12 games.</p>
      <p>United boss <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> has kept faith with the 23-year-old so far but if the goals don't arrive soon then he may be forced to take him out of the side.</p>
      <p>Kleberson was another Brazilian who struggled to make an impact in the Premier League, after making a high profile move to Manchester United in 2003.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old had helped Brazil win the World Cup in 2003 but he would last just two disappointing seasons before he joined Besiktas in 2005.</p>
      <p>And he sympathises with Joelinton for the pressure that comes with being Newcastle's number nine but he is confident things will change quickly for him once he starts to find the back of the net on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>“Some players are able to adapt quickly to the league, but some players need time to adjust," Kleberson told Chronicle Live on behalf of <a href="https://bonuscodebets.co.uk/#gref">Bonus Code Bets.</a></p>

      <p>"With attacking players, there is a lot of pressure to perform quickly but I know <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joelinton">Joelinton</a> will take his chances and get some goals. That will help him grow, which will change everything for him.</p>
      <p>"It is all about staying strong and positive and eventually it will work for him.”</p>
      <p>Another player whose goalscoring record for Newcastle is under the microscope is Miguel Almiron. The Paraguay international is yet to find the net for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">the Magpies</a> since joining on January's transfer deadline day but has scored in two of his last four games at international level. He also enjoyed an excellent goalscoring record in MLS with 2018 champions Atlanta United.</p>
      <p>Almiron has spurned some gilt-edged chances to break his duck this term but Kleberson is confident things will work out for the 25-year-old soon.</p>
      <p>“It is not easy to jump from the MLS to the Premier League," he added. "I was the same when I first joined the league in England.</p>
      <p>"They need to give Almiron time and he needs to keep working hard as eventually his time will come, he is a good player and things will work for him soon.</p>
      <p>"He needs to stay positive and work hard every day in training and his opportunity will happen.”</p>
