      <p>Scientists at Hungary's Atomki Nuclear Research Institute have expressed a belief that they may have stumbled upon hard evidence of a previously unknown natural force – a very special particle, described as a “protophobic X boson”. It is thought to be able to carry a force that acts over microscopic distances not much greater than that of an atomic nucleus, Attila Krasznahorkay’s team <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10459">writes in arXiv</a>, where the research has been published, but has yet to be peer-reviewed.</p>
      <p>The so-called “protophobic X boson” has been formally named X17, as its mass is estimated to not exceed 17 megaelectronvolts.</p>
      <p>The researcher and his colleagues first reported some curious findings in 2015 after studying the light emitted during the radioactive decay of the unstable isotope beryllium-8, something which has attracted a great deal of attention since the construction of the first particle accelerator in Cambridge.</p>
      <blockquote>It was concluded back then that when protons were fired at the isotope lithium-7, which builds beryllium-8, the subsequent decay of the particles did not produce exactly the expected light emissions, but rather a “bump” sound.</blockquote>
      <p>The latter led the scientists to believe that the instant when atoms decay, excess energy among their constituent parts briefly creates a new particle, which then shortly splits into a well-known positron and electron pair.</p>
      <p>If the unique particle’s existence is ultimately ascertained, scientists will have to reassess the interactions of the known four forces of particles, thereby paving the way for studies of a potential fifth one.</p>
      <blockquote>As the research team put it in their paper, they are expecting “independent experimental results to come for the X17 particle” in the years to come.</blockquote>
