      <p>Limerick hurler Paul Browne has retired from inter-county hurling.</p>
      <p>Bruff man Browne made the announcement via the county board website this evening.</p>
      <p>Browne, 30, was a senior player for 11 years, making his League and Championship debuts in 2009. He was on the Munster SHC winning team of 2013 and was vice-captain last year although was unable to play due to a cruciate knee injury.</p>
      <p>"I have decided that the time is right for me to step away form the Limerick Senior Hurling Panel after 11 seasons involved," Browne said.</p>
      <p>"I leave with nothing but wonderful memories and pride from my 11 years playing with Limerick.</p>
      <blockquote>To have shared the dressing room with all my past team-mates and this incredible panel of players now has been the greatest honour of my life.</blockquote>
