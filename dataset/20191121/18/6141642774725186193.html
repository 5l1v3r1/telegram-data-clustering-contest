      <p>Twitter is granting all users the power to hide replies to their tweets that they find abusive or irrelevant.</p>
      <p>The feature has been in testing in Canada since July, before expanding to the United States and Japan in September, and it is now being made available globally.</p>
      <p>During the initial trial, the social network found that people mostly decided to hide replies because they found them “irrelevant, off-topic, or annoying” and as a new way to shut out noise.</p>
      <p>While the feature removes replies from being immediately visible, other people can still see them by tapping on a grey icon to reveal responses.</p>

      <p>However, some testers told the company they were afraid that hiding replies could lead to retaliation, a concern Twitter said it would continue to take feedback on.</p>
      <p>“Currently, repliers can shift the topic or tone of a discussion and derail what you and your audience want to talk about,” Twitter said.</p>
      <p>“To give you more control over the conversations you start, we tested the option for you to hide replies to your tweets.</p>
      <p>“We learned that the feature is a useful new way to manage your conversations.”</p>
      <p>The firm also said it is working on other new controls and “more clarity around the rules of conversation spaces”.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Twitter issued a sharp rebuke to the Tories after the party temporarily rebranded one of its official Twitter accounts as a fact-checking service called “factcheckUK” during the ITV leaders’ debate.</p>
      <p>The social network warned that any further attempts to mislead the public on its platform during the General Election will lead to “decisive corrective action”.</p>
      <p>Twitter has been bolstering its efforts to block misleading information during the election campaign after earlier this month launching a new tool to enable people to report deliberately misleading details about the voting process.</p>
      <p>The platform has also announced a ban on political adverts.</p>
