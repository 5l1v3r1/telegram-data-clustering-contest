      <p>Big Ada (GAR) Nov. 21, GNA – Mr Gideon Carlos Ackweh, the National President of Ada Secondary School Old Students Union (Nimeli) has expressed concern about the encroachment of the school lands which is now illegally being developed into residential facilities.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ackweh said: "Our major headache now is how to construct a fence wall around the school. We have realised that people are encroaching rapidly on the school land.</p>
      <p>“We want to meet and discuss with the original owners of the school land from Dangmebiaweh clan. We want to engage them to look at the bigger picture of the education of the children”.</p>
      <p>He encouraged the current students to use everything they have now to better their education.</p>
      <p>The Old Students as part of initiative to support the school donated 80 barrels to be used at the dormitories, a water tank and 10 dustbin containers to the school.</p>
      <p>Mr Ebenezer Graham Acquaah the Headmaster of the Ada Senior High School admitted that encroachments have happened on the school lands by the indigenes and pleaded for help.</p>
      <p>“We do not know what to do to curb this land encroachment issue, but the old students have started the fencing yet it is very slow, we are therefore appealing to benevolent people across to come to our aid,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also identified Teachers’ accommodation as a major challenge stressing that “the teachers are forced by the lack of accommodation on the campus to rent houses outside the school premises, which affected monitoring and supervision of students.</p>
