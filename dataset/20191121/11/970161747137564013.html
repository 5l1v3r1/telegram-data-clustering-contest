      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chris-tarrant/">Chris Tarrant</a>’s ex-wife has slammed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jeremy-clarkson/">Jeremy Clarkson</a>, saying she ‘doesn’t rate’ the former Top Gear presenter as the host of quiz show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</p>
      <p>Ingrid Tarrant believes that Clarkson just simply ‘hasn’t taken over’ from her former husband, who fronted the programme for 16 years from 1998-2014.</p>
      <p>The 65 year-old was married to the TV host for 16 years too, although the couple split in 2007.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Mirror, the Wish You Were Here? presenter said: ‘I’ve never even seen Chris on TV since I left. I can’t bear to look at his lying eyes and the insincerity.</p>
      <p>‘But I have seen Jeremy doing Millionaire and I don’t rate him at all. I don’t think he has successfully taken over the role.’</p>
      <p>Well, each to their own we suppose!</p>
      <p>Clarkson took over from Tarrant as the host of the iconic quiz show in 2018, when it was rebooted for its 20th anniversary.</p>

      <p>Tarrant and his tenure on the programme are going to quickly come back into the spotlight, however, in a new TV drama.</p>

      <p>Michael Sheen will be portraying the former teacher in Quiz, which explores the scandal which saw Major Charles Ingram and wife Diana win the £1 million jackpot using illicit means.</p>
      <p>While he was competing on the show, Charles’ friend Tecwen Whittock sat in the audience, coughing when a correct answer was mentioned until the top prize was sneakily won.</p>
      <p>The case went to trial where Ingram, his wife and Whittock were all convicted for ‘procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception’ in 2003, and given suspended prison sentences for two years and each fined £15,000.</p>

      <p>The Welsh actor may have been an unlikely choice to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/16/michael-sheen-play-chris-tarrant-wants-millionaire-charles-ingram-scandal-drama-10583020/">play the iconic TV presenter</a>, but will be stepping into Chris’ shoes to tell the story of the 2001 cheating drama that rocked the country.</p>
      <p>Honestly, we’ve been intrigued – if a little sceptical – to see how Michael would physically become Chris, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/29/michael-sheen-shares-first-glimpse-chris-tarrant-quiz-10649360/">the transformation</a> is pretty uncanny.</p>
      <p>Recreating the now infamous image of Chris grinning as he appeared at court to give evidence in the case’s trial in 2003, Michael is all orange tan and toothy smile as he beams for the camera while being ushered inside by police.</p>
