      <p>A mum who spent her life avoiding the sun was shocked when a tiny scab on her nose turned out to be deadly skin cancer.</p>
      <p>Katy Flynn, 31, ignored the pin prick-sized speck on the side of her nose for a year and only mentioned it to her GP as an aside during another appointment.</p>
      <p>Even then the mum-of-two was told it was ‘nothing to worry about’ and a dermatologist went on to prescribe a gel to clear abnormal cells.</p>
      <p>After many more months of failed treatment, Katy was eventually diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma.</p>
      <p>She has now been left with a four-inch scar after medics cut away the tumour and pulled down the skin from her forehead to cover the wound.</p>
      <p>Katy, who is engaged to boyfriend Chris, 33, and is mum to daughters Miley, nine, and Abbie, five, said she feels lucky to be alive.</p>

      <p>The bank worker, from Harpurhey, Manchester, said: ‘I just woke up with it one day, it was just a tiny scab the size of a pen dot so I assumed one of the girls had caught me with their nails.</p>

      <p>‘I was in shock when doctors told me it was skin cancer.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve always been a shade-seeker, I avoid the sun at all costs.</p>
      <p>‘When I go on holiday, I’m head to toe in factor 50 all the time.</p>
      <p>‘My friends laugh at me because they’ll all be laid out in the sun and I’ll be sat in the shade with my book.</p>
      <p>‘The only time I ever tried going on a sunbed was for a minute as a teenager and I hated it so I came straight off.</p>
      <p>‘I never thought this would happen to me but it has made me realise that anyone can get skin cancer – whether you’re a sun seeker or not.’</p>

      <p>Katy first spotted the scab in December 2016 and turned to creams and moisturisers to get rid of it, thinking it was eczema or a bacterial infection.</p>
      <p>The following December she mentioned it to her GP and in January 2018 she was referred to dermatologists.</p>
      <p>By this point, it was about the size of a 5p piece and Katy was diagnosed with solar keratosis, pre-cancerous sun damage which if left untreated could turn into skin cancer.</p>
      <p>She was prescribed a topical gel to kill any pre-cancerous cells and sent on her way.</p>
      <p>The scab would fall off and regrow even bigger than before but Katy thought that was because she kept knocking it when washing her face.</p>

      <p>Eventually in December 2018, dermatologists took biopsies from her nose and she was diagnosed with cancer in February this year.</p>

      <p>Medics performed Mohs surgery at Salford Royal Hospital where thin layers of skin are progressively removed and examined until only cancer-free tissue remains.</p>
      <p>After six hours of surgery, Katy was referred to The Christie Hospital in Manchester for a facial reconstruction.</p>
      <p>Doctors took skin from her forehead and pulled it down over her nose to graft over where the cancerous cells had been removed.</p>
      <p>However, part of the process involved leaving her with an open flap of skin for a month so that the skin would remain alive and start to regrow.</p>

      <p>Katy added: ‘As soon as I knew it wasn’t life threatening and there was something I could do about it I felt relieved.</p>
      <p>‘I’m not ecstatic with the way it looks but there’s no point being down about it.</p>
      <p>‘When I had the forehead flap, I didn’t really leave the house apart from to pick the kids up from school.</p>
      <p>‘I couldn’t face all the questions, I didn’t want to have to answer them.’</p>
      <p>At home Katy said she never used the word cancer to her daughters as they had recently lost their grandfather to the disease.</p>
      <p>But she showed them images of what the skin flap would look like so they were prepared.</p>
      <p>She is about to return to work and admits to being nervous about dealing with customers who might stare at her scar.</p>
      <p>Katy continued: ‘I do wonder if the doctors had taken biopsies in the first place rather than trying to diagnose me from pictures whether it would have gone this way.</p>
      <p>‘But it’s happened now and I’m just lucky that it wasn’t life threatening and I’m still here for my children and husband-to-be.’</p>
