      <h1>Alex Salmond appears in court accused of sexual offenses</h1>
      <h2>Ex-Scottish first minister said he will defend himself ‘to the utmost in court.’</h2>

      <p>Alex Salmond appeared in court Thursday charged with carrying out a series of sexual offenses while serving as Scotland's first minister.</p>
      <p>He faced 14 charges at the High Court in Edinburgh — one attempted rape, one intent to rape, 10 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults. Speaking outside court, Salmond said: “I refute these allegations of criminality and I will defend myself to the utmost in court,” the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/21/alex-salmond-court-attempted-rape-charges-scotland-former-first-minister">Guardian</a> reported.</p>
      <p>All the alleged offenses are said to have taken place between June 2008 and November 2014, when Salmond was first minister. The attempted rape is said to have taken place in June 2014 in Bute House in Edinburgh, the official residence of the first minister.</p>
      <p>Last year Salmond faced an internal Scottish government investigation into complaints against him. He denied any criminal misconduct and in early January won a legal victory against the Scottish government after the civil service admitted its investigation had been mishandled.</p>
      <p>Salmond was Scottish National Party leader during the 2014 independence referendum. He stepped down after losing the vote and in 2017 lost his seat in the Westminster parliament. He later hosted a controversial chat show on the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/alex-salmond-rt-russian-roulette-with-reputation/">Moscow-backed TV station RT.</a></p>
