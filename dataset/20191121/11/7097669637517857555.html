      <p>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The Latest on migrants in Europe (all times local):</p>

      <p>Spanish humanitarian ship Open Arms has rescued 73 migrants from a distressed boat off Libya’s coast.</p>
      <p>The NGO said Thursday on its Twitter account that the rescued migrants included four women, a 3-year-old and a 4-year-old, and 24 unaccompanied minors.</p>
      <p>Open Arms said the migrants showed signs of gunshot wounds, traumatic shock and serious hypothermia.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, another humanitarian ship, Ocean Viking, said it had rescued another 30 people from a boat in distress off the Libyan coast, bringing the total number of migrants aboard the rescue vessel to 125.</p>
      <p>NGOs have been involved in bitter disputes with the Italian government in recent months, after the country previously denied safe harbor to rescue ships under the former hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini.</p>

      <p>A French appeals court is expected to hand down a verdict in the case of a mountain guide who was convicted of helping migrants illegally enter the country.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s ruling is the latest of several cases putting to the test France’s "principle of fraternity," which allows humanitarian aid for irregular migrants.</p>
      <p>A lower court in the Alpine town of Gap gave Pierre Mumber a three-month suspended prison sentence in January, charging that he helped several West African migrants cross the Italian border near Montgenèvre in 2018.</p>
      <p>Mumber has appealed the decision, arguing he was simply providing legal humanitarian assistance.</p>
      <p>Local aid group Tous Migrants says he was bringing warm drinks, boots and clothing to migrants crossing the Alps when he was detained.</p>

      <p>Cyprus police say 120 Syrian migrants have been housed at a reception center after arriving from Turkey aboard a boat.</p>
      <p>Police said Thursday that the 97 men, 20 children — including 14 unaccompanied minors — and three women told authorities they each paid people traffickers $4,000 (3,620 euros) for a spot on the boat.</p>
      <p>Their vessel was spotted Wednesday sailing off Cape Greco on the southeastern tip of the island nation and was escorted to an area harbor.</p>
      <p>The migrants said they set sail from Turkey’s southern port city of Mersin after crossing the Syrian-Turkish border on separate dates.</p>
      <p>Cyprus officials say a migrant influx is taxing the small country’s ability to host so many arrivals and is asking fellow European Union member states to share the burden.</p>
