      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/audi/">Audi</a> has so much going on at the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/la-auto-show/">L.A. Auto Show</a> with the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/20/2020-audi-rs-q8-revealed-los-angeles-auto-show/">RS Q8</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/14/2020-audi-s8-revealed/">S8</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/19/audi-e-tron-sportback-revealed/">E-Tron Sportback</a>, and RS 6 Avant that it's paid hardly any attention to a limited-edition <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/audi/rs+5/">RS 5</a> exclusively for the U.S. market. Audi will make only 100 RS 5 Panther Editions, 75 of them being Sportbacks, the other 25 coupes. The saucy name comes from the exterior paint called Panther Black crystal effect, a hue normally secured through Audi Exclusive. In the sunlight, what looks like the black of the void <a href="https://www.audi-sport.net/xf/threads/mythos-black-vs-panther-black.259385/#post-2634727">takes on a deep purple sheen</a>; we're not sure if the same light tricks affect the Amazonian cat, but the name sounds cool. The other exterior changes are a matte black Quattro badge, silver trim on the splitters front and rear, and a set of 20-inch, five-twin-spoke wheels borrowed from the European <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/10/02/2020-audi-rs-4-avant-performance-wagon/">RS 4 Avant</a>.</p>
      <p>Inside, the Panther Edition gets elements of the <a href="https://www.audi.ca/ca/web/en/models/a5/rs5-coupe/build-price.html#layer=/ca/web/en/models/a5/rs5-coupe.mediathek_infolayer.GPEFPEF.html">interior design package normally available in Canada</a> but coming to the U.S. for the first time. The tweaks include a black Nappa leather interior with crescendo red stitching, black seatbelts with a red edge, and black Alcantara on the steering wheel and center console sides. According to <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29860756/audi-rs5-panther-edition-revealed/"><i>Car and Driver</i></a>, there's a chance other U.S.-bound Audi models will get the Black Panther treatment in the future.</p>
      <p>The car is priced at $88,995 after the $995 destination charge and will arrive in <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/car-dealers/">dealerships</a> next month. The price is $13,800 more than the standard RS 5 Sportback and coupe, which sounds like a lot, but Audi Exclusive paint is normally a $3,900 standalone option, and Audi's fancy 20-inch wheels — the ones you can get here, unlike the Panther Edition wheels — can add $5,500 on their own.</p>
