      <h1>Orlando Dreamers MLB pitch subjected to social media ridicule</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:13:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Gaydos</a></address>
      <p>A former NBA executive made his pitch Wednesday to bring a Major League Baseball team to Orlando.</p>
      <p>Pat Williams, who co-founded the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/orlando-magic">Orlando Magic</a>, said Orlando was more deserving of an expansion team than about a half-dozen cities who have made proposals, including Charlotte, Las Vegas, Montreal, Nashville, Portland and Vancouver.</p>

      <p>“Orlando keeps growing and sports needs to be a part of that,” Williams said.</p>
      <p>Williams proposed that the Orlando Dreamers become the next team in professional baseball. He donned a red cap and red T-shirt that featured what could become the Dreamers’ logo.</p>
      <p>However, the pitch was mocked on social media.</p>

      <p>Williams’ chances of getting a major league team to Orlando could be slim. Florida already has two professional baseball teams, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/miami-marlins">Miami Marlins</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/tampa-bay-rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a>. Both teams rank near the bottom of baseball in attendance, despite the Rays being a playoff team in 2019 and the Marlins having two World Series championships.</p>
      <p>Williams said he was dipping his toe in the water before making formal plans. Major League Baseball didn’t comment on the matter.</p>

      <p>MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has put any possible expansion talks on hold until the Rays and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/oakland-athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> get new ballparks.</p>
