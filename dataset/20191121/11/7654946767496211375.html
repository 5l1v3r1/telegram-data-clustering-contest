      <h1>Bloomberg most popular of last three New York City mayors — Blas polls just 35 percent</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:18:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:18</time> by <a rel="author">Bernadette Hogan</a></address>
      <p>Ex-New York City Mayor and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/bloomberg-files-paperwork-for-democratic-primary-in-arkansas/">potential presidential hopeful</a> Michael Bloomberg is more popular than his successor and predecessor — Bill de Blasio and ex-mayor Rudy Giuliani, a new poll found.</p>
      <p>New Yorkers crowned Bloomberg the best out of the five boroughs last three mayors in a new Siena College survey published Thursday.</p>
      <p>“He is, by far, more popular than both his predecessor and his successor,” Siena College pollster, Steve Greenberg, remarked of Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>The Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat gets a thumbs-up from 47 percent of voters statewide, while compared to 39 percent with a negative view.</p>
      <p>More than half of Democrats — 55 percent — said they had a favorable image of New York’s last three-term mayor, compared to just 35 percent of Republicans.</p>
      <p>De Blasio notched a 27 percent approval rating statewide, while 56 percent said they disapproved. Hizzoner’s approval rating among New York City voters is just 35 percent.</p>
      <p>But the man once known as America’s Mayor was the most unpopular of them all: 62 percent of New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Giuliani, who is regularly in the headlines these days thanks to his current role <a href="https://nypost.com/tag/rudy-giuliani/">as President Trump’s attorney.</a></p>
      <p>Less than a third of voters, 30 percent, said they had a favorable impression of the man once simply known as “Rudy.”</p>
      <p>That overall rating is bolstered thanks to his 58 percent approval rating from Republican voters in the state — while only 16 percent of Democrats across the state say they like him.</p>
      <p>Back in the city, Giuliani’s approval rating is even lower than de Blasio’s — 27 percent.</p>
      <p>The survey queried 797 New Yorkers and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.</p>
