      <h1>Argos Black Friday deals: the best predictions for the 2019 sales</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:53:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>Those who think the high street is dead clearly didn’t take a trip to Argos last <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/">Black Friday</a>. More than 1 million customers visited Argos stores in person on the day and 71 per cent of customers visited via a mobile device. </p>
      <p>Can Argos expect the same popularity for Black Friday 2019? It depends, of course, on its deals. And while the company is staying tight-lipped about <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">what discounts you can expect</a> during the sales this year, on November 29, we have analysed last year’s sales, as well as market trends, to predict what deals Argos might have in store this Black Friday. </p>
      <h3>What were the best-selling deals last year?</h3>
      <p>Last year, Argos offered a range of Black Friday discounts on products across beauty, technology and toys.  </p>
      <p>The company has revealed that its biggest sellers in the Black Friday sales were:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>LEGO Classic Creative Brick Box Building Set</li>
        <li>Google Chromecast</li>
        <li>TP-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug</li>
        <li>Lenovo Ideapad 11.6” Laptop</li>
        <li>Philips Series 7000 12-in-1 Grooming Kit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Argos also mentioned that they sold a lot of PS4 Consoles with the game Red Dead Redemption. “Black Friday was our biggest day ever for video gaming,” Argos said in a statement. </p>
      <p>Bearing this in mind, we can broadly expect a similar influx of discounts on gaming and tech products (especially laptops), as well as sales on grooming kits and toys. More details below. </p>
      <h3>What can we expect from Argos for Black Friday 2019?</h3>
      <h4>Gaming</h4>
      <p>As gaming products were so popular in last year’s sales, we anticipate there will be similar discounts for Black Friday 2019. As Fortnite continues in popularity, we predict there will be deals on the Sony PS4 500 GB and <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1995767">Pro 1TB consoles</a>, both of which come with the Fortnite Neo Versa in a bundle. </p>
      <p>Similarly, there could be deals on the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8676010">PS4 Pro 1TB console with Red Dead Redemption 2 Bundle</a>, which we predict would be more heavily discounted, as it featured in last year’s sales. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>The XBox One S is now an older model, due to the popularity of the Xbox One X. As such, we predict significant deals on One S bundles - such as the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8643081">Xbox One S 1TB Console &amp; Forza Horizon 4 Bundle</a>. However, there could also be smaller discounts on the newer model, the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8655725">Xbox One X</a>, as it currently has a hefty price tag.</p>
      <p>The new kid on the hand-held block, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1994768">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, could be offered at a discount to attract attention. The slim device is an update on the Nintendo Switch but comes with fewer features, as it does not connect to the television. Customers may therefore need extra incentive to invest in one, which is why we predict discounts. At the same time, the original <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/2077921">Nintendo Switch</a> could be offered at a discount because it is now an older model, so we also predict savings on this console. </p>
      <p>Read our guide on the best <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-gaming-deals-black-friday-2019-sale-nintendo-ps4-xbox-games/">Black Friday gaming deals</a>.</p>
      <h4>Laptops</h4>
      <p>If this year’s Black Friday is anything like the last, there will be deals on an array of tech - including laptops, notebooks and sim-free phones.</p>
      <p>Laptops are frequently offered at a discount. As a general rule, the best laptop deals for Black Friday will offer a 20 per cent discount from its RRP - if the discount is higher than that, be sure to check the specifications and reviews. </p>
      <p>Last year, there were significant reductions on the Lenovo IdeaPad models, and for Black Friday 2020 we predict deals on <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1405817">the Lenovo IdeaPad 330s</a> (with an i5 processor) as it has already had a 20 per cent discount, and is currently priced at £399.99.  </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Apple products might be included in this year’s sales, and we predict a significant discount on the 2017 model of the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/6981240">13-inch MacBook Pro</a>, given that there is now a 2019 model. We also believe that Argos might shed some of the price off its <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1243189">2019 model</a>, to make it more appealing, but we don’t predict a large discount for this fairly new gadget. </p>
      <p>The lighter and more compact 13-inch<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8658265"> MacBook Air</a> might also feature in the sales, as it is currently retailing at Argos’ lowest ever price, at £949. </p>
      <p>Read our guide on the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/predictions-best-laptop-deals-black-friday-cyber-monday-sales/">best Black Friday laptop deals</a>.</p>
      <h4>Other tech</h4>
      <p>Aside from laptops, you can expect to find <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/predictions-best-mobile-phone-deals-black-friday-cyber-monday/">deals on phones</a>. We especially anticipate offers on the Huawei P30 Pro range, as many of these are already retailing at their lowest price. </p>
      <p>Gadgets for the home are often popular, too. Given the popularity of its older model last year, we predict the newer Google Chromecast Ultra will be on offer this year. This product, which allows you to watch content in up to 4K Ultra HD and HDR from your phone, tablet, laptop or TV, is almost a year old, so we expect a slight discount.</p>
      <p>The high-tech Ring Pro doorbell <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/predictions-best-black-friday-cyber-monday-tech-deals2/">featured in many Black Friday deals last year,</a> and we anticipate further reductions on this model, as well as a slight reduction on the newer Ring 2. Smart home tech is still a huge trend, so keep your eyes peeled for any <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-home-security-cameras/">home security cameras</a> in the sales.  </p>
      <h4>Kids toys</h4>
      <p>From building blocks to board games, Black Friday 2018 saw a variety of deals on kids toys. Argos revealed the LEGO Classic Creative Brick Box Building Set was among their best sellers last year, so we predict similar toys will be on offer again in 2019. </p>
      <p>Interactive toys have also been popular in previous sales, with the FurReal Roarin' Tyler the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9190959">Playful Tiger</a> featuring as one of Argos' toy deals last year. This adorable children's toy, which can roar and respond to sounds and touch, was reduced to £69.99 from £134.99.  </p>
      <h3>Tips for shopping at Argos</h3>
      <p>There were millions of customers on the Argos website last year, according to the company. To make your online shopping process as seamless as possible, we have compiled the below guide to finding discounts and speeding up checkouts. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Start looking early. </b>Argos have been known to host two weeks of sales in the run-up to Black Friday, so start looking for deals from mid-November. </li>
        <li><b>Set up an account.</b> Argos recommend signing up for an online account so you’re all ready to go on the day, and can check out your products as quickly as possible. </li>
        <li><b>Subscribe to the Argos pages.</b> Follow the store’s Facebook and Twitter pages to get real-time information on all the latest deals. You could also download the Argos app.</li>
        <li><b>Follow the Telegraph’s live coverage. </b>We will be posting deals as soon as they become available, so follow our <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/">Black Friday and Cyber Monday coverage</a> to find out more. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Create a shopping list.</b> You can create a Black Friday shopping list on the Argos site by clicking the heart button next to the desired products. Each item will then be saved to your account so, on the day, you can check out quickly when the deals go live.</p>
      <p><b>Use Fast Track Collection. </b>Argos’ chief advantage over <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/amazon-black-friday-2019-best-deals-uk-today-early-sale-offers/">Amazon</a> is its Fast Track Collection. When you’re checking out online, you can choose to collect your order in-store at any time over the next seven days (which is a better alternative to postal chaos). </p>
