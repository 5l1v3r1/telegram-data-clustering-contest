      <h1>Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum finalise divorce – but there’s a twist</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:58:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author">Robyn Lucas</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town - Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum are officially single.</p>
      <p>A judge has reportedly ruled that the couple, who were married for almost nine years, are now legally single, according to court documents obtained by <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/channing-tatum-and-jenna-dewan-are-legally-single/"><b>US Weekly</b></a>.</p>
      <p>But there’s a catch.</p>
      <p>Although deemed single, Channing and Jenna still have to reach an agreement on their property as well as custody of their six-year-old daughter, Everly.</p>
      <p>The pair announced in April 2018 that they were separating, with the American actress filing for divorce six months later, citing irreconcilable differences, <a href="https://people.com/movies/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-are-officially-single/"><b>People</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>"We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple," the <i>Step Up</i> co-stars said at the time in a joint statement distributed on social media.</p>
      <p>"We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now.</p>
      <p>"There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision – just two best friends realising it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.</p>
      <p>"We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly."</p>
      <p>Jenna is expecting her second child with her boyfriend, actor and singer Steve Kazee.</p>
      <p>"Jenna plans to marry Steve and is so in love with him," a source told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1083560/jenna-dewan-and-channing-tatum-finalize-their-divorce"><b>E! News</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"They have had many long and open talks about that and it's definitely the plan.</p>
      <p>"What matters most though is that she and Steve are fully committed and so excited to have a baby and grow their family.</p>
      <p>"She knows they will be engaged and married soon enough."</p>
