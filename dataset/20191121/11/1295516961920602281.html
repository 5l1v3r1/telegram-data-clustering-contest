      <p>Professor Vardemus and his less-than-altruistic agenda begin to surface in new official stills from <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/legacies-tv/"><i>Legacies</i></a> Season 2.</p>
      <p>The CW has released photos from the season's seventh episode, ominously titled "It Will All Be Painfully Clear Soon Enough," that show Landon and his girlfriend Josie confronting the Salvatore Boarding School for the Young &amp; Gifted's new headmaster. Meanwhile, Josie and her fraternal twin sister Lizzie commiserate with Hope as she contemplates leaving town.</p>
