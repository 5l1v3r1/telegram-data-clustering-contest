      <p><i>Captain Marvel</i> #12 marks the start of the highly anticipated "The Last Avenger" storyline. Marvel had already teased that, as of this issue, Carol Danvers would sport a new red and black costume to reflect her status as a villain. But outside of her clashing with the Avengers, we had no clue what was going to happen, why Carol would turn against her closest allies, or what other characters would be involved in the story.</p>

      <p>As issue #12 begins, we don't find out why Captain Marvel has broken bad. Instead, she is already wearing her new black and red costume, and she takes the fight straight to an unassuming Thor.</p>
      <p>The battle is a conflict that takes the two Avengers all over the world but, eventually, Captain Marvel is able to subdue the God of Thunder. However, the real surprise arrives at the end of the issue, when Carol presents the head of Thor to her mysterious benefactor on the Moon, in the remnants of the Inhuman city New Artcilan: Vox Supreme.</p>

      <p>The villains known as the Vox first appeared in 2018's <i>Death of the Inhumans</i>. In the limited series, Black Bolt and the Royal Family were attacked by the Vox, who were engineered by the Kree to wipe out the Inhumans and wage war. The series later revealed that there wasn't just one Vox, but a whole army's worth of them. In actuality, the Kree trapped Inhumans in the Vox suit and transformed them into obedient, deadly hunters. <i>Death of the Inhumans</i> ended with Black Bolt wiping out the entire Vox army, but not without some Kree escaping the slaughter.</p>
      <p>Now, the appearance of Vox Supreme in <i>Captain Marvel</i> #12 marks the Inhuman villains' first appearance since the conclusion of <i>Death of the Inhumans</i>. However, this character appears to be something new. The Vox we know had black and red costumes and were out in numbers. This Vox Supreme, however, appears to be something else. The name alone implies that he is higher up the food chain than a regular member of the species. Moreover, his costume is not black with crimson highlights, but emerald instead. Clearly, this Vox is different -- and possibly a whole lot more dangerous.</p>

      <p>Since Carol's new costume is now red and black, and since we know that the Vox are involved, then could Vox Supreme have somehow turned Carol into one of them? Is Carol Dangers one of his new generals? At this point, any guess is as good as the next.</p>
      <p>Whatever the reason, Carol seems to have some sort of plan. Given that the Vox are a weapon engineered by the Kree, and considering Carol's close ties to the alien race, then it's possible this is all part of an elaborate scheme to infiltrate them. That is if Vox Supreme doesn't catch on and sees through her deception.</p>
