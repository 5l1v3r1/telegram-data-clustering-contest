      <h1>Israeli police detain Palestinian governor of Jerusalem</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:28:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">ANADOLU AGENCY</a></address>
      <p>Israeli police detained Jerusalem Governor Adnan Ghaith on Thursday, according to eyewitnesses.</p>
      <p>The detention came after police raided Ghaith's residence in Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood, the eyewitnesses told Anadolu Agency (AA).</p>
      <p>Ghaith has been detained several times in recent months.</p>
      <p>The reason behind the detention remains unclear and Israeli police have yet to issue an official statement.</p>
      <p>Jerusalem remains at the heart of the decades-long Mideast conflict, with Palestinians hoping that east Jerusalem – occupied by Israel since 1967 – might one day serve as the capital of a Palestinian state.</p>
      <p>International law continues to view east Jerusalem, along with the entire West Bank, as "occupied territories" and considers all Jewish settlement construction there as illegal.</p>
