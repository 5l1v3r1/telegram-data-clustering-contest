      <h1>A mother who claims Hunter Biden fathered her child went public with a DNA test because he stopped paying child support, lawyers say, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:55:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Bostock, Business Insider US</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>The mother of Hunter Biden’s previously unknown child outed him as the father because he stopped paying to support the child, her lawyers say.</li>
        <li>Attorneys for Lunden Alexis Roberts submitted a <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/1120seal/">court filing on Wednesday</a> declaring “with scientific certainty” that Biden was the father of the child, born in August 2018.</li>
        <li>Attorneys say the decision was made over Biden’s “refusal to continue to support his child.” They are seeking $11,058 in fees, and filed a petition for paternity and child support.</li>
        <li>“She really does not want this to be a media spectacle. She does not want this to affect Joe Biden’s campaign. She just wants this baby to get financial support from the baby’s father,” attorney Clint Lancaster said.</li>

      <p>The mother of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hunter-biden-father-of-luden-roberts-child-dna-test-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Hunter Biden’s previously unknown child</a> made the results of his positive DNA match public because he stopped supporting the child financially, her lawyers say.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for Lunden Alexis Roberts cited Biden’s “refusal to continue to support his child,” <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/1120seal/">in a motion filed Wednesday at the circuit court</a> in Independence County, Arkansas.</p>
      <p>They were not explicit about what support had been in place previously.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/1120seal/">separate document lodged with the court declared</a> “with scientific certainty” that Biden was the father of Roberts’ child, born in August 2018. The child’s name and gender have not been made public.</p>
      <p>The attorneys said Biden is “not expected to challenge the results.” He has yet to respond to the claim.</p>
      <p>Clint and Jennifer Lancaster filed a petition for paternity and child support on May 29, months before the case became public.</p>

      <p>They say Biden previously admitted to Roberts that he was the father, but that she has gone public because he stopped providing child support.</p>
      <p>“She really does not want this to be a media spectacle. She does not want this to affect Joe Biden’s campaign. She just wants this baby to get financial support from the baby’s father,” Clint Lancaster <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/20/dna-test-shows-hunter-biden-father-arkansas-womans/">told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.</a></p>
      <p>Roberts met Biden while studying at George Washington University, her lawyers said.</p>
      <p>Business Insider contacted Biden’s attorney, Dustin McDaniel, for comment, but is yet to receive a response.</p>
