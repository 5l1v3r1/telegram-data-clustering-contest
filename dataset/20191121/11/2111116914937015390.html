      <p>If you've been waiting until <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> to pick up a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/wearables/best-smart-watches-what-s-the-best-wearable-tech-for-you-1154074">great smartwatch</a> or fitness tracker deal, you've made the right choice. Early Black Friday deals from various retailers have slashed the price of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/fitbit-versa-review">Fitbit Versa</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/fitbit-charge-3">Fitbit Charge 3</a>, two of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/wearables/best-fitbit-which-is-right-for-you-1322700">best Fitbits</a> you can buy right now.</p>
      <p>Some of them are part of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon's early Black Friday sales</a>, while the discount on the Fitbit Charge 3 comes directly from UK network O2.</p>
      <p>Fitbit is a household name for its wearables, including fitness trackers and smartwatches, but they're sometimes a little pricey. However, at these new all-time-low prices, the devices are much more affordable.</p>
      <p>The Fitbit Charge 3 currently tops our list as the best Fitbit available right now thanks to its large screen, range of fitness features and totally waterproof design. You can now pick it up for the first time at a sub-£80 price, although if you want the version with Fitbit Pay you're paying a bit more (it's still discounted though).</p>

      <p>If you want in on the Fitbit ecosystem but don't like the look of the Charge, there's another device that's at an all-time low price, and it's even more heavily discounted than the Charge 3.</p>
      <p>This is the Fitbit Versa, a device which launched in 2018 and was so popular it lead to the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/fitbit-versa-lite-review">Versa Lite</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/fitbit-versa-2-review">Versa 2</a> in 2019. It's comfortable on the wrist, has all the features that make Fitbit devices great, and is especially useful for tracking your sleep.</p>
      <p>The Fitbit Versa Special Edition is also discounted, which comes with a woven band for an even more premium feel, although there's nothing to dislike about the silicone strap that comes with the base edition (<a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/should-you-use-a-smartwatch-or-fitness-tracker-if-you-have-a-skin-condition">unless you have a skin condition</a>).</p>
