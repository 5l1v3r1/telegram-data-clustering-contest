        <b>Car enthusiasts rejoice, Toyota cars are finally returning to the Forza Motorsport series after an alleged two-year Sony exclusivity deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While no concrete deal was ever announced, the Japanese car manufacturer worked heavily with Sony’s Polyphony Digital studio to bring 18 Toyota vehicles to the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/rumoured-ps5-dev-kit-is-real-according-to-exclusive-reveal-report/">simulation racer Gran Turismo Sport</a>.</p>
      <p>Going back to 2017 with the release of Forza Motorsport 7, Toyota distanced themselves away from the Forza brand. When the official car list was revealed, all Toyota production vehicles were absent.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately it isn’t always possible to align the interests of fans and the interests of our manufacturing partners,” <a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_postsm790426_Little-chat-about-Toyota-Lexus.aspx">announced community manager Brian Ekberg in 2017</a>. “As a result, production Toyota vehicles are not represented in Forza 7. We’re as disappointed as you are about this news and, while we hope to bring Toyota production vehicles back to Forza games in the future, it is worth noting that a small number of Toyota race cars will be included in the game. Look for that list in a future edition of the Forza Garage.”</p>
      <p>Other Western racers also saw a lack of Toyota representation: <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ea-unleashes-fast-and-furious-like-need-for-speed-payback-gameplay-trailer/">Need for Speed: Payback</a>, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/review-the-crew-2-quantity-over-quality/">The Crew 2</a>, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/review-dirt-rally-2-0-fixes-its-predecessors-problems-but-forgets-to-add-anything-new/">Dirt Rally 2.0</a>, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/need-for-speed-heat-gameplay-trailer-released-customise-cars-today-with-mobile-app/">Need for Speed: Heat</a> and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/review-forza-horizon-4-amazing-gameplay-with-a-few-bugs/">Forza Horizon 4</a>.</p>
      <p>Toyota will be making a return to the Forza series next month. <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1196868827646222337?s=20">Announced via the official Forza Motorsport Twitter account</a>, Forza Horizon 4 players will be able to get their hands on the 1998 Toyota Supra RZ as a part of the Series 17 update.</p>
