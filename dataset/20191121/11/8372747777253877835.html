      <p>LANSING, Mich. — It's a popular nail technique that promotes long lasting color and shorter wait times for drying, but some manicurist stray away from offering the service <a href="https://www.fox47news.com/news/local-news/warning-nail-dip-powder-can-cause-infections">because of sanitary concerns.</a></p>
      <p>The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs issued new rules for dip powder practices due to a method that could spread infection through cross-contamination.</p>
      <p>“In a salon setting, it should be used in a way that client’s fingers aren't dipped into the container itself,” said Amanda Bedard, owner of Utopia Salon in Lansing.</p>
      <p>The requirements prohibits using the same jar of powder for more than one client and left-over dip must be thrown out after each use.</p>
      <p>“I would pour just enough that I know I am going to use on the service without wasting product," Bedard explained.</p>
      <p>“I would take and sprinkle it on each individual finger.”</p>
      <p>Using the same utensils and left-over powder in between clients can raise a public health risk.</p>
      <p>“Generally the funguses kind of show up as discoloration on the nail,” said Bedard.</p>
      <p>“You know warts kind of can look very different, sometimes they can show up as kind of skin-colored and just a little bit raised, where other times you know they can actually look like an infection.”</p>
      <p>If you see any signs of infection, seek medical attention.</p>
      <p>Violators of the new rules could face a penalty from the state, which could result in a license suspension.</p>
