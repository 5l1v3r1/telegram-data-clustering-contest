      <p>This year’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GrammyAwards">Grammy Award</a> nominations snubbed South Korean pop group <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bts">BTS</a>, and the music world is extremely confused as to why.</p>
      <p>Despite being one of the most successful groups in existence, the band were completely omitted from the nominations announcement, which took place on Wednesday (20 November).</p>
      <p>BTS’s many successes in 2019 included becoming the first group since The Beatles to score three number one albums in less than a year, selling out stadiums across the globe for their Love Yourself: Speak Yourself Tour, which grossed just under $117m, and reaching the Billboard Hot 100 with Halsey collaboration “Boy with Luv”.</p>
      <p>Many expected them to be named in the Record of the Year category, and they seemed like a dead cert to earn a nomination for Best World Music Album.</p>
      <p>However, they were snubbed by the Recording Academy, with many expressing their confusion and anger on Twitter. </p>
      <p>Halsey wrote: “BTS deserved many nominations. I am however, unsurprised that they weren’t acknowledged. the US is so far behind on the whole movement. the time will come. [sic]’</p>
      <p>Another user tweeted: They’ll never nominate BTS for #GRAMMYs or Album of the Year. The music isn’t in English and they are bias towards English artists. Grammys are insecure to let minority’s win. When was the last time you saw Asians win a Grammy? The show is rigged.”</p>
      <p>Thousands of BTS's ”furious” fans reacted to the snub, unable to comprehend the fact their favourite band were ignored.</p>
      <p>Lizzo and Billie Eilish lead this year’s nominations, which you can see a complete list of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/grammy-nominations-full-list-2020-lizzo-billie-eilish-best-album-artist-song-record-a9210756.html">here</a>. </p>
