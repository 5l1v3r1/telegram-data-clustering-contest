      <p>“For us as her family it’s kind of bittersweet, we’re immensely proud yet saddened that she isn’t here to witness and enjoy this, although I feel that she is in spirit.”</p>
      <p>Guitarist Noel Hogan added: "We wanted to finish this album for our dear friend and band mate Dolores.</p>
      <p>"It’s a tribute to her, the band and our fans for the past thirty years. Being honoured with this Grammy nomination has made this whole process even more special."</p>
