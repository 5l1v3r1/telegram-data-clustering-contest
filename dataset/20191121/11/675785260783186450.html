      <p>Harrowing video emerged of a group of villagers brutally butchering an elephant to death in Kenya.</p>
      <p>The clip, which has been circulating on social media since Monday, shows the men wielding axes and machetes towards the elephant's hind legs.</p>
      <p>They repeatedly slashed the injured animal as it wailed in pain on the ground.</p>
      <p>Some people are heard cheering and clapping hands in the background.</p>
      <p>The elephant tried swinging its bleeding legs while the villagers chopped chunks of flesh off its legs.</p>

      <p>The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) was alerted of the video and has launched an investigation into the matter.</p>
      <p>Ngugi Gecaga, spokesman for the KWS, told <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001350038/kws-gory-video-of-jumbo-being-killed-fake-old">Standard Digital</a> that the unfortunate event did not happen recently.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are aware of the unfortunate video that is circulating on social media.</p>
      <p>"Preliminary investigations indicate that this is a very old clip contrary to what the public is being led to believe.</p>
      <p>"We shall share more once we get full information from our people on the ground."</p>

      <p>He said the video is believed to be from Kithoko, Meru County.</p>
      <p>Wild animals are protected from cruelty in Chapter Five the 2010 Kenyan Constitution under Environment and Natural resources.</p>
      <p>The parliament of Kenya passed the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (2012) which prohibits the public from fighting or causing any physical harm to both domestic and wild animals.</p>
