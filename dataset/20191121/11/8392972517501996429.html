      <p>There's been a fair bit of name-dropping in the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> jungle already this year, but they don't come much bigger than the nugget Roman Kemp let slip on Wednesday night's Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>Roman revealed that he received "a letter from <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-harry/">Prince Harry</a>" inviting him to DJ at a garden party at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>With James Haskell and Ian Wright listening intently, Roman said: "I was playing a track and someone came over and said: 'Roman, come here.' It was Prince Harry."</p>

      <p>He added: "Princess Kate is there, there's a slingshot in the middle and they've got a bucket filled with water balloons and they're just pinging off these water balloons."</p>

      <p>"In people's faces?" Ian asked.</p>
      <p>"Into the crowd over a balcony!" Roman exclaimed.</p>
      <aside>There's a slingshot in the middle and they've got a bucket filled with water balloons and they're just pinging off these water balloons.</aside>
      <p>"So Harry goes: 'Come here, come here.' He gave me one of these things, I look up and what's happening is I've got Harry here holding it, Kate here holding it, and I'm going what is going on? What is my life?" Roman laughed.</p>

      <p>"And then he goes: 'A bit to the left, a bit to the left,' and I'm like: 'Who am I going for?' And he goes: 'My brother,'" Roman revealed.</p>

      <p>Revealing he chickened out of throwing the water balloon at <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-william/">Prince William</a>, Roman told his campmates: "I was like: 'I'm not doing it, I'll get done for treason.'"</p>
      <p>In perhaps the most surprising revelation of the chat, Roman concluded: "So Kate goes: 'Oh, I'll do it!'"</p>
