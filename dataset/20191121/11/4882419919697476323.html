      <p>Former Manchester United striker says Gareth Bale was silly to celebrate with a flag that mocked Real Madrid on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Bale was captured laughing in front of the caption: 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.'</p>
      <p>The images of the forward drew ire at Real Madrid, the club that pays his wages.</p>
      <p>The flag was a joke based on Bale's recent comments that he's more excited when he plays for his country -- although he said he gives his all whenever he steps on to the pitch.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he has regularly been criticised in Spain for his love of golf, which he plays in his spare time.</p>
      <p>Berbatov said: "There is obviously some tension between Gareth Bale and Madrid.</p>
      <p>"Of course, he is Welsh and he is going to put his country first but I don't know why he needed to celebrate with that flag, I know it is a bit of banter but it springs unwanted attention.</p>
      <p>"He didn't need that, it's his decision and maybe he felt he wanted to show something like that but for me it wasn't necessary.</p>
      <p>"Maybe it was an emotional moment or maybe he didn't know what was on the flag, either way it doesn't look great and I think it was a bit silly."</p>
      <p>The ex-Bulgarian striker continued: "He's a quality player and it's true, he isn't treated the right way in Spain, but if you have to ask if you aren't treated the right way why are you still there?</p>
      <p>"If you are good enough, every team will want you and you will play football again."</p>
