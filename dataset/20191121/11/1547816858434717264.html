        <b>Want to get a body as hot as Katrina Kaif? Well, you can! The actress recently shared a glimpse of her daily workout routine chart!</b>

      <p>In Bollywood, Katrina Kaif is synonymous with hotness. Other than her acting chops and gorgeousness, it’s the actress’ perfectly-sculpted and super-fit body that gives all her contemporaries a huge run for their money. Well, to maintain the same, Kat has to undergo some intense workouts and a lot of sacrifices, because being fit ain’t an easy task. Recently, we got our hands on the Tiger Zinda Hai actress’ daily gym routine and guys; it’s giving us some highly inferior complexities!</p>
      <p>Taking to her Instagram account, Katrina Kaif shared a glimpse of her workout chart in the gym. The list includes some intense weight training and cardio exercises. The circuit 1 on Katrina Kaif's gym routine includes Kb reverse lunge, jump squats, kb double pulse walking lunge, box jumps, weighted sumo squats with heels lifted and kb deadlifts. While the second circuit includes Kb squat and press, drop push-up, supine weighted bent-knee jackknife, X mountain climber, beer can lateral flye and plank jacks with theraloop above the knee. And two sets of all these on a regular basis, sigh.
