      <h1>Snapchat’s new Time Machine ageing filter is like FaceApp (but less controversial)</h1>

        <b>Snapchat has just released Time Machine, a new ageing lens that’s guaranteed to go viral. It lets you slide between looking really young and looking really old, and it’s a lot like FaceApp − but minus most of the privacy fears.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As you’d expect Time Machine a lot of fun to use, and it works through your phone’s selfie camera and front-facing snapper. And we all know what that means: hours spent terrorising your friends, of course!</p>

      </p>
      <p>To access the Time Machine filter, take the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fire up your phone’s app store and reinstall the Snapchat app</li>
        <li>Spend a few minutes trying to remember your login details</li>
        <li>Once you’re in, tap the filter icon</li>
        <li>Select the option that shows a baby and an old person side by side (Time Machine is available on both iOS and Android)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Snapchat app will give you a quick tutorial on how to use the filter, but it’s a case of slide left to go back in time, and slide right for a wrinkly fright.</p>
      <p>Remember FaceApp? It was a summer sensation, and at one point it was near impossible to scroll down your Twitter or Instagram feed without catching a glimpse of a digitally aged (or de-aged) selfie.</p>
      <p>However, people’s enthusiasm for the app quickly died after fears were raised that the app, which was launched by a Russian developer, had been harvesting users’ entire photo libraries.</p>

      <p>There was, however, <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/winners-losers-amazon-prime-day-faceapp-3923428">no evidence to suggest that this was indeed the case</a>, and it’s likely that the rumour managed to spread so successfully because of the Russian connection.</p>
      <p>Investigators did, however, find that FaceApp was uploading users’ pictures to servers <i>located in the US</i> for processing, rather than locally on the device − but then again this isn’t that unusual.</p>
