      <p>Parkpine Capital, which has supported new ventures like the <a href="https://www.siliconvalleyit.org/">Silicon Valley</a> Institute of Technology, is putting on the <a href="https://www.gvsummit.co/">Global Ventures Summit (GVS)</a> this week for the first time in Europe. The Summit will bring leading Silicon Valley VCs to Luxembourg to meet and network with their European counterparts and to connect with European startups who want to raise capital. </p>
      <p><a href="https://today.rtl.lu/news/business-and-tech/a/1434630.html">Actor and Partner at Parkpine Billy Zane </a>says, "the goal is to expose seasoned Silicon Valley VCs to the European startup ecosystem, the collaboration aims to secure over USD 2B in valuation growth and funding to the extended Luxembourg ecosystem. Because good ideas don't just come out of Silicon Valley, GVS seeks to provide support for the best business ideas, startups, and entrepreneurs coming out of innovative emerging markets across the planet. As a leading FinTech hub in Europe, Luxembourg is the perfect location for the Summit". </p>

      <p>"The Global Ventures Summit brings "Silicon Valley to the World" and is focused on empowering scalable technologies in high growth markets. GVS attendees include significant US funds like Kleiner Perkins, GE  Capital, Draper Nexus, Pritzker Group, Microsoft Ventures, and HTC Ventures, according to Ahmed Shabana, Managing Director and Founder of Parkpine Capital."</p>
      <p>Raphael Martin, an entrepreneur at GVS, said, "it was great to listen to the speakers and talk with venture capital firms about what I need to do to get my new company ready for funding. I wanted to understand funding better and find out what it takes to get it. I also realized this morning from Mr. Zane's talk that I need to learn how to tell my story better." </p>
      <p>Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg's Prime Minister, said, "bringing GVS to Luxembourg gives European startups as well as our local ecosystem the visibility &amp; growth opportunities they need." Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg's Finance Minister, added: "Bringing the Global Ventures Summits to Europe will help unlock significant funding opportunities for European and Luxembourg-based startups with leading venture capital firms, and connect European innovation, including in the area of Fintech, with Silicon Valley, the leading venture capital hub in the world."</p>
      <p>I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhettpower_linkedinlive-powerlunchlive-gvsluxembourg-activity-6602902504407650304-tfTT">sat down with five teams from Luxembourg University</a>, who briefly gave me their elevator pitches.  The companies were impressive. They ranged from a company that helps grocery stores reduce waste and be more efficient in ordering goods to a company that has created a device that will create the conditions of the human body and will help eliminate animal testing.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhettpower_linkedinlive-powerlunchlive-gvsluxembourg-activity-6602891414894374912-xccz">The VCs I spoke with were impressed </a>and surprised by the talent and planned to continue conversations.  </p>
      <p>Shabana explained, "GVS is designed to provide the highest chance for any startup to get funding. At GVS Luxembourg, we are expecting over ten deals with over $50M in value between startups, venture funds, and limited partners. The way it is planned, GVS Luxembourg, will attract over 1500 participants from over 50 countries. <a href="https://www.parkpine.com/">Parkpine Capital</a> is excited to partner with LHoFT and Luxembourg on the first GVS in Europe."</p>
      <p>GVS will <a href="http://www.rhettpower.com/">have over 100 exhibitors and a pitch your startup</a> competition offering over $50,000 in prizes for the winning teams.  Luxembourg<a href="http://www.powerlunch.live/"> was the last stop of the GVS </a>tour this year with shows in Los Angeles, Mexico, and Indonesia. </p>
