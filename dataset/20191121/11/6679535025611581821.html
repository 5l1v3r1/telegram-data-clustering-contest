      <p>The Kurnool Chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI) is set to launch a massive property show in Kurnool on November 22 on the STBC College grounds. This is the third of its kind to be set up in the city.</p>
      <p>Addressing the mediapersons on Wednesday, G. Ramana, president of Kurnool CREDAI, said the event would last for three days, from 22 to 24 and would be inaugurated by Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy.</p>
      <p>The exhibition, with an aim to bring awareness among prospective home buyers and owners, would house over 70 stalls to showcase various construction products, Mr. Ramana added.</p>
      <p>Of these 70 stalls, eight have been dedicated to the builders to showcase various constructions across the city including apartments, independent houses, and commercial complexes. The rest will focus on material suppliers, layout developers, interior designers, bankers, and even motor vehicle companies.</p>
