      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/">Daily Star</a>, Gemma said: "I've got people in Harley Street getting bits and pieces sorted.</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time Gemma has spoken about having children.</p>
      <p>The star suffers with polycystic ovaries, and in the past she has voiced her worry about her ability to fall pregnant and that her biological clock is ticking.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a> earlier this year, Gemma said her doctor had formulated a plan for when she starts trying for a baby.</p>

      <p>At the time, Gemma explained: "I got two second opinions. Everything is going to be OK. I need to lose weight and take a drug called Clomid, which I'm looking to do at the end of the year."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, reports claimed Gemma and her on-off boyfriend James 'Arg' Argent <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins/james-argent-and-gemma-collins-vow-to-lose-weight-before-trying-for-baby/">had vowed to lose weight before trying for a baby</a>.</p>
      <p>A source claimed the pair were "in the happiest place" at the moment and were hoping to have "a big spring wedding".</p>
      <p>The insider also claimed the pair want to "start trying for a family" over the next few months.</p>
      <p>They told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10320641/gemma-collins-james-arg-argent-weightloss-relationship-wedding/">The Sun</a>: "Gemma and Arg are both in the happiest place they've been in a long time and finally feel as if they can start planning their future together.</p>
