      <p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/19/itv-general-election-debate-2019-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn/">ITV head-to-head general election debate</a> took place on Tuesday night, as candidates continue their campaigning for the upcoming <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/general-election-2019-uk-date/">December general election</a>. </p>
      <p>Head-to-head battles and multi-party TV debates play a significant role in the build up to political events and this general election is no different, as a range of TV specials are set to take place ahead of the Dec 12 vote. But what time can you tune in, which channels are they on and who is taking part?</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about the general election TV coverage, including where and when you can see party leaders debate the important topics.</p>
      <h3>When are the general election debates and what TV channel are they on?</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/18/itv-election-debate-boris-johnson-throws-four-question-challenge">first head-to-head debate on Nov 19 took place on ITV</a>, with Sky News proposing Nov 28 for the next debate.</p>
      <p>The BBC confirmed that they will also be holding two debates of their own on Nov 29 and Dec 6, in addition to a series of Question Time specials. </p>
      <p>The first Question Time leaders' special will air on BBC One at 7pm tomorrow - Nov 22. Prime Minister <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/behind-mask-real-boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>, Labour Party leader <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/21/jeremy-corbyn-rebel-whose-greatest-strength-also-devastating/">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, Liberal Democrats leader <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/jo-swinson-mp-lib-dems-leader/">Jo Swinson</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/snp-scottish-national-party-sturgeon/">SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon</a> will take part.</p>
      <h3>What time do the general election TV debates start?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>BBC Question Time special, Friday Nov 22, 7pm (BBC One).   </li>
        <li>Sky News general election debate, Thursday Nov 28, TBC (Sky News).</li>

      </ol>
      <h3>What happened in the ITV general election debate?</h3>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn took part in the first televised party leaders' debate on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Hosted by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/19/debate-johnson-corbyn-never-got-going-itv-wouldnt-let/">Julie Etchingham</a>, the ITV special marked the first time since 2015 that both the Labour and Conservative party leaders have taken part in a TV debate. </p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was mocked over his Brexit policy by a live television audience, after he refused to say whether he thought Britain should leave the EU or remain. Mr Johnson, meanwhile, faced criticism over the issue of truthfulness.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/20/who-won-itv-general-election-debate/">According to a snap poll by YouGov</a>, 51 per cent of viewers thought the Prime Minister performed better than Mr Corbyn.</p>
      <h3>Who will take part in the Sky News general election debate?</h3>
      <p>Sky News has invited the Liberal Democrats, Conservative and Labour party leaders to attend their live TV debate proposed for Nov 28. </p>
      <p>So far only Liberal Democrat head Jo Swinson has accepted the broadcaster's invitation, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/04/jo-swinson-threatens-legal-action-itvs-refusal-grant-place-leaders/">after challenging her exclusion from the ITV debate</a>.</p>
      <p>Sky News originally proposed a live TV debate between the leaders of the current government and the opposition, but now believes "it is sensible to suggest an alternative approach that will allow the public to properly scrutinise a wider range of views". </p>
      <h3>Who will take part in the BBC debates?</h3>
      <p>The BBC has unveiled plans to hold <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/08/bbc-unveils-plans-hold-10-election-debates-three-weeks/">10 special election programmes in the space of three weeks</a>, including a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the major political parties on Nov 29, live from Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn will then take part in the BBC Prime Ministerial Debate in Southampton on Dec 6. BBC Radio 4's Today presenter Nick Robinson will be chairing this head-to-head debate, as well as the seven-way podium event.</p>
      <p>Prior to these two events,  the first episode of a series of Question Time specials will be shown on BBC One. The election special, set to take place on Friday Nov 22, in Cardiff, will see leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, SNP and Liberal Democrat parties each answer questions from the audience for 30 minutes. </p>
      <p>Nigel Farage, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/07/brexiteers-will-never-forgive-tories-brexit-party-failure-unite/">leader of the Brexit Party</a>, and one of the Green Party's co-leaders, either Sian Berry or Jonathan Bartley, will also be able to take questions in two further Question Time specials. </p>
      <p>Emma Barnett will host the final special edition of Question Time on Monday Dec 9, where an audience of under-30s will question senior figures from each of the main parties. </p>
      <h3>Will any more general election TV debates be announced?</h3>
      <p>So far, only ITV, Sky News and the BBC have announced their plans to hold general election TV debates.  </p>
      <p>In addition to the main coverage, BBC Wales will be holding two live debates on Tuesday Nov 26 and Tuesday Dec 3.</p>
      <p>BBC Scotland is set to broadcast its Scotland Leaders debate live from Glasgow on Tuesday Dec 10 and on the same night at 10.45pm, Northern Ireland party leaders will be debating in front of a studio audience. </p>
      <p>ITV has also said they will announce details of further election coverage, including a multi-party debate, in due course. </p>
