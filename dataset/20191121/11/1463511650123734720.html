      <h1>Suspected fraudster gets N500,000 bail over N9,000 fraud</h1>

      <p>A Tinubu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State on Thursday granted N500,000 bail to a 32-year-old man, Ogbonna Iteh, who allegedly possessed fake $200 and defrauded a woman of N9,000.</p>
      <p>The Magistrate, T.A. Anjorin-Ajose, also ordered the defendant to produce two sureties as a condition for the bail.</p>
      <p>Anjorin-Ajose said one of the sureties must be a blood relation of the defendant and the other a civil servant.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Iteh, who resides on Aboki Estate, Ikate, Elegunshi, Eti-Osa, Lagos State, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, fraud and possession of fake currency.</p>
      <p>He, however, pleaded not guilty to the offences.</p>
      <p>The Prosecutor, Inspector Ajaga Agboko, told the court that the defendant and one other person at large conspired to defraud one Faith Samuel of N9,000.</p>
      <p>He said Iteh committed the offences on November 13 at 8am at Abijo Lekki, Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos State.</p>
      <p>Agboko said the defendant also had in his possession fake $200.</p>
      <p>He said: “Iteh’s accomplice (who drove their vehicle), gave a ride to Samuel, who was taking her children to school.</p>
      <p>“In the vehicle, Iteh said that he just returned from abroad and God sent him to help the complainant; he gave her 200 dollars and told her to bring any amount she has in naira.</p>
      <p>“Samuel told them she had only N9,000 in her account; the duo told her to go and withdraw it; they followed her to a bank; she withdrew the money and gave it to them.</p>
      <p>“The duo left; the complainant went into the bank to change the 200 dollars but was told that it was fake.</p>
      <p>“Samuel traced them back to where they picked her and saw only the defendant where he was trying to defraud another woman, she raised an alarm and he was caught.”</p>
      <p>Agboko said the offences contravened Sections 314, 329 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.</p>
      <p>Anjorin-Ajose adjourned the case until December 5 for substantive hearing.</p>
