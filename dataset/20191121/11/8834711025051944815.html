      <p>KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala said all provincial government structures that incurred irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure in the last financial year would be held accountable.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu revealed that KZN incurred irregular expenditure of over R12 billion, the highest figure of all provinces and even national government.</p>
      <p>Zikalala said he would intensify his clean audit drive.</p>
      <p>The province spent R2.6 billion more in irregular expenditure in the 2018/2019 financial year compared to last year.</p>
