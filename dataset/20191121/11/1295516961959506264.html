      <p>Throughout Season 6 of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-flash-tv/"><i>The Flash</i></a>, Barry Allen has grappled with his long-predicted death after learning that the coming "Crisis" had been moved up by five years, and in a new promo, he is tempted to leave his destiny behind.</p>
      <p>The CW has released a clip for the first half of Season 6's two-part midseason finale titled "The Last Temptation of Barry Allen, Part One." As the "Crisis" approaches, the season's overarching villain <a href="https://screenrant.com/flash-season-6-villain-bloodwork-explained/">Bloodwork</a> plays mind games with Barry, attempting to take him over at his weakest point by playing on his fears of his looming mortality. Meanwhile, Barry's long-dead mother Nora Allen arrives to comfort him to do what he does best: keep moving forward.</p>
