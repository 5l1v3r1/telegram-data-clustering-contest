      <h1>Kim Kardashian to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan: Celebrity moms who got trolled for allowing kids to wear make-up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:16:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>As if life under the spotlight wasn’t hard enough, some of our biggest stars often find themselves battling social media trolls. From picking on their outfit choices to their work and even targeting their families, there’s just no end to the hateful comments strewn at them.</p>
      <p>Of late, it has been celebrity moms like from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kim-Kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> in Hollywood to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aishwarya-Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a> Bachchan and even <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mira-Rajput">Mira Rajput</a> in Bollywood, who have been trolled for letting their kids wear make-up.</p>
      <p>Kim, who has a booming make-up and beauty business, has often found herself on the receiving end of critics, slamming her for letting her then 5-year-old daughter <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/North-West">North West</a> wear makeup. The star, who posts videos and photos of her little girl trying out her make-up line, was first criticised for letting North wear bright red lipstick and straightening her hair for a Christmas photo shoot. But that has not stopped Kim or North from experimenting with their looks from time to time.</p>

      <p>Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was also recently trolled on social media for letting Aaradhya wear eyeliner and lipstick for her 8th birthday party. While some shared their concerns about a child wearing makeup, others asked, “why they feel the need to put makeup on her face?”</p>

      <p>A while back, it was Shahid Kapoor’s wife, Mira Rajput who was trolled for allegedly colouring her daughter’s hair. Although the colour was just temporary paint, trolls jumped the gun and slammed Mira. Deciding she would not let the trolls have their way, she shared photos of her daughter’s highlights and said, “Relax guys it’s just temporary.” She also added, "I'm not a regular mom, I'm a cool mom."</p>

      <p>At an event, Mira opened up about the trolling and said, "It wasn't a colour. It was regular paint. She (Misha) just had a nice time and I think it's just about letting your children be creative, letting them be free and letting them have a good time. I think it doesn't make sense to get serious about everything,"</p>
