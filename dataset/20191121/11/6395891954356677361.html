      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - Former Scottish leader Alex Salmond, one of the country's best-known politicians, has appeared in court accused of sex crimes including attempting to rape a woman at the leader's official residence.</p>
      <p>Salmond faces a total of 14 charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault against 10 women.</p>
      <p>He denies all the charges. The 64-year-old Salmond said outside Edinburgh's High Court on Thursday that "I am innocent and I will defend my position vigorously."</p>
      <p>Salmond led the pro-independence Scottish National Party for 20 years and headed Scotland's semi-autonomous government as its first minister from 2007 to 2014.</p>
      <p>He took Scotland to the verge of independence from the U.K. by holding a 2014 referendum. He stepped down as leader after the "remain" side won the vote 55% to 45%.</p>
