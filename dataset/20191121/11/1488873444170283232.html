      <h1>Berlin-based Plantix raises €6.6 million in funding to further improve its agricultural app</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:32:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.eu-startups.com/author/thomas-ohr/" target="_blank">Thomas Ohr</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://plantix.net/en/">Plantix</a>, the platform that drives efficient agricultural production, today announced a €6.6 million Series A funding round led by early stage tech investor <a href="http://rtp-global.com/">RTP Global</a>, joined by Piton Capital, with participation from existing investors including Atlantic Labs and Index Ventures.</p>
      <p>The fresh capital will be used to improve Plantix’s AI-driven solution which provides a digital method for the automated detection of plant diseases. One million farmers in India are already using the platform and the company is set to expand into Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>
      <p>Plantix was founded in 2015 to tackle the issue of crop failure on a global scale and help to increase yields. Up to 30 per cent of the world’s harvest is lost due to disease and pest infestation, threatening livelihoods and increasing the risk of food shortages. With the free app, users can take photos of their diseased crop which are then processed by Plantix’s AI-driven image recognition software. Users are then shown the most probable disease, nutrient deficiencies or relevant pests.</p>
      <p>According to the startup, Plantix offers the world’s largest independent database for the detection of plant disease, with users receiving advice on the treatment of the affected plant, which consists of conventional, but also cost-effective and ecological suggestions.</p>
      <p>The app also serves as a global community of scientists, farmers and plant experts, where users can exchange information on crop issues in real-time. The platform offers instant access to cutting-edge preventative measures, disease and weather alerts and reminders for pesticide application.</p>
      <p>Simone Strey, Co-Founder and CEO of Plantix, stated: <i>“Food production is one of mankind’s most pressing issues and we are committed to improving farming techniques. We have built the world’s largest database of plant damage to tackle this problem and will be using this fresh capital injection to grow it further. </i><i>In developing and emerging countries in particular, our digital solution can drastically reduce crop losses, minimise pesticide use and increase overall yield. We are delighted to have attracted a group of investors who are as convinced of our product and vision as we are. The funding will allow us to further optimise our app, make new strategic hires, and expand our global community of experts.”</i></p>
      <p>Galina Chifina, Partner at RTP Global, added: <i>“With 15 million images on file, Plantix already has the world’s largest plant database. More than a million farmers are already improving their yields with the app, and 50 thousand images are being uploaded every day, so it’s fair to say we see huge potential in Plantix. This new round of funding is a testament to the dedication of Simone and her team as well as the strength of the Plantix platform. The app can and will make a major contribution towards building a more sustainable and intelligent global agriculture system by using digital solutions to solve the problems associated with an incredibly fractured ecosystem.”</i></p>
