      <p>PureVPN is considered to be one of the best VPNs on the market, which is why it's usually $10.65 a month. But right now you can get it for <a href="https://www.purevpn.com/lifehacker-special?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=aff-30478"><b>$1.92 a month</b> for 3 years</a>.</p>
      <p>So what do you get? In addition to online privacy and security, PureVPN is supported by both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome and even has its own desktop client. It also claims to be one of the few remaining VPNs that works with U.S. Netflix. We haven't tested this for ourselves though.</p>
      <p>There's also a 31 day money back guarantee if you change your mind.</p>
