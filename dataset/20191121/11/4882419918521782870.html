      <p>Tottenham Hotspur's appointment of Jose Mourinho, replacing Mauricio Pochettino, is still an image many football fans are getting used to. It's been a season to forget for Spurs and Daniel Levy turned to the most expensive 'free agent' in football management to get his project back on track. Mourinho has been handed the biggest contract in the club's history, second only to Pep Guardiola in the league, and he didn't accept the role without a few conditions of his own.</p>
      <p>According to the 'Mirror', the Portuguese coach insisted that he wouldn't take the job unless there were assurances that Harry Kane would remain at the club. Mourinho sees the striker as a key member of his team and wants to build around him. Levy was told he must do everything he can to keep Kane in North London.</p>
      <p>Mourinho took charge of his first training session yesterday and spoke at length to both Kane and Dele Alli. If Spurs are to turn their fortunes around, Jose will need both of them to be firing on all cylinders.</p>
