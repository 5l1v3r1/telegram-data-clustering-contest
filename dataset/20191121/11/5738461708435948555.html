      <p>The weather forecast for Louth for the next few days looks underwhelming to say the least.</p>
      <p>According to Louth Weather this morning, it going to be "very wet" between now and Sunday, with up to 40mm likely up to Saturday and "15mm possible late on Sunday".</p>
      <p>Don't expect any let up in between showers either:</p>
      <p>"Little or no sun. Temperatures about or slightly above average, but feeling cooler in the windier than average conditions."</p>
      <p>
