      <p>The Xiaomi manual DIY projector comes with a 58-frame film. It does not need a battery or a connecting cable. It can directly project the 58-frame film by turning the projector’s hand crank. The 28mm focal length lens makes it easy to control the size and brightness of the image. All parts of the projector use laser-cutting technology in Germany. In addition, accurate cutting ensures the precision of the assembly.</p>
