                <p>Under normal circumstances, this would result in the price of the player skyrocketing. Just as it did for the likes of Joao Felix, Ousmane Demebele, Kylian Mbappe and several youngsters who were sold for blindingly high prices. However, with Erling Haaland, the clubs can breathe a sigh of relief. That is because his contract with Red Bull Salzburg contains a buyout clause; One that many top clubs would consider quite affordable.</p>
                <h3>Erling Haaland release clause revealed</h3>
                <p>German newspaper <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/bundesliga/vereine/rb-leipzig/erling-haaland-red-bull-salzburg-poker-transfer-66134768.sport.html">Sport Bild</a> have reported that Erling Haaland can be bought out from his contract at Red Bull Salzburg for 30 million Euros. While some may consider the price a steal, <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.de/erling-haaland/profil/spieler/418560">German Transfermarkt</a> believes that this is the appropriate amount one should dish out on him.</p>

                      <p>Haaland started the season with a market value of 12 million Euros. However, he has risen to 30 million by November. The list is normally updated on a semi-annual basis but a first-time exception was made for the Norwegian.</p>
                      <p>His 7 goals in the Champions League so far and 26 goals in 18 matches in all competitions this season may have something to do with it.</p>

                            <p>Haaland has been the subject of a big move to either of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United. However, it is likely that his next move will be to RB Leipzig. Bar United, it is unlikely that the 19-year old will get enough first team chances.</p>
                            <p>With Leipzig however, not only will he get regular playing time but because of the similar strategies employed, Haaland may not take too long to acclimatise. With experience and maturity under his belt, it is likelier that Haaland will have a better chance at succeeding in the aforementioned big clubs.</p>
