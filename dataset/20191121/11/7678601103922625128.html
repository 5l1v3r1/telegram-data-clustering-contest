      <h1>2nd Indonesian Music Conference to explore fairness, sustainability of music industry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:17:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:17</time> by <a rel="author">Gisela Swaragita</a></address>
      <p>The second edition of the Indonesian Music Conference is to be held on Nov. 23 in Bandung, West Java, following the success of the inaugural conference last year in Ambon, Maluku.</p>
      <p>Indonesian Music Conference 2019 is themed "Working together toward a fairer and more sustainable music industry".</p>
      <p>“Music plays a big role in our lives but sadly, not every [musician] in this country is treated fairly and can work sustainably,” singer Glenn Fredly, who initiated Indonesian Music Conference, said on Tuesday during a press conference at M Bloc Space in South Jakarta.</p>
      <p>Glenn, who also initiated Kami Musik Indonesia (We are Indonesian music), known as KAMI, said that the first conference in 2018 succeeded in bringing together the industry's stakeholders – musicians, record labels, music managers and music publishers alike.</p>
      <p>The second conference plans to cover topics like forming a musicians' union, the Creative Economy Law and the development of "cities of music", while the previous one addressed common problems in the industry, including efficient royalty payments, the balance and power and standardizing musicians' fees.</p>

      <p>“The Indonesian music industry is also still very centralized in Jakarta. Musicians think they have to go to Jakarta to be successful,” said Nadia Yustina, the founder of Amity Asia Agency and a member of the Arts Coalition.</p>
      <p>She continued, saying that many potential musicians had to give up their dreams a supportive music ecosystem did not exist in their hometowns. </p>
      <p>Indonesian Music Conference 2019 is organized by KAMI in collaboration with Ruma Beta Foundation, Art Coalition and Dyandra Promosindo. Aside from discussions, the event has a line-up of live performances that includes D’Cinnamons, Serdadu Bambu, Tuan Tiga Belas and Karinding Attack.</p>
      <p>The conference is free to the public, but those interested in attending <a href="https://www.loket.com/event/kami2019">must register online</a> no later than Nov. 22. (mut)</p>
