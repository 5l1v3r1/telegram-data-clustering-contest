        <b>Alex Neil says Preston North End won't be selling players in the January transfer window.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lilywhites' strong start to the season has inevitably seen key players attract attention but Neil was robust about the plans for January when speaking at Springfields on Thursday morning.</p>

      <p>During his pre-match press conference to look ahead to Saturday's visit to Derby County, the North End manager was asked about the forthcoming window.</p>
      <p>Neil said: "We won't be selling anybody in January. Speaking frankly, why should we let anybody go in January?</p>
      <p>"If we did I think it would be a catastrophic mistake because of what we have done.</p>
      <p>"I don't think it is even something we should consider doing.</p>
      <p>"These lads are happy to be here, want to be here, we think we are on the cusp of doing something quite special.</p>
      <p>"This is certainly the closest we have been for a number of years."</p>
      <p>Neil said that in terms of bringing players in, recruitment was an ongoing process.</p>
      <p>"We have started to turn our attention to January," said Neil.</p>
      <p>"We are five or six weeks away and it is an ongoing process. More time will be invested in it over the next few weeks."</p>
      <p>Neil added: "We will see what the window brings. If you ask me, you need to try and strengthen the squad in every window.</p>
      <p>"We have to make sure that come the end of January we are in a stronger position than going into the start of January."</p>
