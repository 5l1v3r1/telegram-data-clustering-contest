      <p>A torture victim has said he accepted he was going to die before managing to escape his captors.</p>
      <p>In what has been described by one of the officers leading the investigation as one of the worst cases of his career, two thugs held one of their victims captive and tortured him over the course of 11 hours.</p>
      <p>David Pattinson, 37, and Arthur Collin, 49, were branded dangerous criminals by a judge and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/northumberland-men-tortured-victim-jailed-17288145">handed lengthy prison sentences</a> for their violent crimes after appearing at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In April this year, the duo held their 26-year-old victim captive at Pattinson’s home address in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/berwick">Berwick</a> and subjected him to repeated assaults, including being stabbed and beaten.</p>

      <p>The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was able to escape when the men attempted to move him to another location and he was able to flee and flag down a passing bus.</p>
      <p>In a statement read out in court, the victim said: “I had actually given up on my life at that point in the night and accepted I was going to die.</p>
      <p>“What makes this whole event worse is the fact Pattinson and Collin have never admitted their guilt and they have made me go to court and relive the whole experience again.”</p>

      <p>Police have now released images of the victim's blood-stained clothes, which were found in a wheelie bin, and a hammer which was found at the scene.</p>
      <p>This incident occurred only three weeks after Pattinson had assaulted another man at his address.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old victim feared so much for his own safety that following the assault he fled the address without his shoes on.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Detective Constable</a> Anthony Murray, one of the leading officers on the investigation, said: “I’ve dealt with some particularly nasty and violent cases during my career as a police officer but this has been one of the worst.</p>

      <p>“Pattinson and Collin are two incredibly dangerous offenders who are now safely off our streets. However, the physical and mental trauma suffered by the victims will live with them their whole life.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, knowing they are behind bars will bring some comfort to the victims and I want to thank him for his bravery and dedication during this incredibly difficult investigation and trial.”</p>
      <p>Pattinson, of Braeside, Berwick, was found guilty by a jury and was sentenced to a total of 20 years for his crimes – 15 years for assault, false imprisonment, threats to kill and possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and five years to run consecutively for the assault three weeks prior.</p>
      <p>Collin, of Hurkur Crescent, Eyemouth, Scotland, was found guilty of assault and false imprisonment and was sentenced to a total of 14 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>DC Murray added: “Our investigation team are delighted with the result and I want to thank everyone on the team for their hard work on this case.</p>
      <p>“I think we all hope we don’t come across another sickening and violent case such as this anytime soon.”</p>
