      <p>New Jersey senator Cory Booker criticized former Vice President Joe Biden for his recent comments opposing the legalization of marijuana at the recent Democratic presidential debate. </p>
      <p>During a recent town hall, Biden stated, "There's not nearly enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug. I want a lot more before I legalize nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it."</p>
      <p>Booker responded by telling Biden, "I thought you might have been high when you said it." He added, "Marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. The war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people."</p>
