      <p>BIRMINGHAM — Britain’s opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn unveiled a radical socialist plan for government on Thursday including a 5% increase in public sector pay, higher taxes on companies and a sweeping nationalization of infrastructure.</p>
      <p>“It’s time to take on the vested interests holding people back,” Corbyn said in the foreward to the election manifesto. “The future is ours to make.”</p>
      <p>“The big polluters, financial speculators and corporate tax-dogers have had a free ride for too long,” he said.</p>
      <p>The manifesto says Labour will introduce a windfall tax on oil companies, de-list companies that do not contribute to tackling climate change and increase public sector pay by 5%. (Reporting by Liz Piper and Kylie MacLellan; writing by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Stephen Addison)</p>
