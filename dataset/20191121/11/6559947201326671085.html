      <p>There will be some price hikes prior to the launch of Black Friday sales, so unless it is truly a top deal, we recommend you avoid most VPN offers until the Black Friday deals commence. That being said, not all subscriptions will be costly before Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Whether you're planning to use a VPN to watch Netflix on holiday, remain anonymous online, or simply protect your privacy, there are plenty of bargain deals waiting for you in the Black Friday sales.</p>
      <p>During Black Friday it's expected that the biggest discounts will be on the longest lasting deals, as these are typically the most expensive. Furthermore, be careful on Black Friday as there will be some sites offering fake discounts or malicious VPN services that do not work. Always use a trusted VPN provider and a reliable website, such as <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/94933/the-best-vpn-deals-for-october-2019">PCMag</a>, to research all the deals.</p>
      <h4>Before Black Friday: VPN Deals</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>It is always good to research the current deals available on services like VPN providers, as prices can change regularly and it can sometimes be hard to tell if you're actually getting a great deal.</p>
      <p>We recommend you use current offers to get a good idea of what the typical prices are for VPN providers. As a result, you will be less susceptible to bogus Black Friday deals.</p>
