      <h2>Britain needs to recognise that public services will not improve without more government revenue</h2>

      <p>Britain needs to pay more tax. Everyone, including me, must contribute more. There can be no relying on others to pay a larger share.</p>
      <p>The requirement to raise tax rates should be obvious to all in the UK. With <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c06c1606-5ed6-3832-8e4f-89e9324a28a0">unemployment at multi-decade lows</a>, it would be risky to assume there is much scope for higher revenues to spring magically from economic recovery. Although there is the usual easy talk of solving Britain’s problems with a clampdown on tax avoidance and evasion, we all know that pressures on public services will grow as the population ages over the coming decade. And all of this will happen at a time few are happy with the performance of Britain’s health, welfare, social care, education, criminal justice, transport or defence services.</p>
      <p>One positive sign this week has been that all three main political parties have implicitly or explicitly accepted this analysis. The prime minister Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5a428948-09f6-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">scrapped plans</a> for a large corporation tax cut next year, the Liberal Democrats are seeking <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b1f66762-0b96-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">large tax and spending increases</a> on a par with Labour’s 2017 manifesto. And Labour plans to be even more radical. Yet in this dismal election campaign, the public is being told that while more tax is needed, someone else will pay.</p>
      <p>The Tories say business will pay for extra National Health Service spending even though companies do not ultimately pay tax. Corporate tax increases will be passed on to customers, employees and shareholders. Mr Johnson has compounded this sin by pledging to reduce the share of people paying national insurance by raising the starting income threshold. This nakedly tells target voters that tax is for other people. Labour goes even further in pretending that ordinary people do not pay tax by pushing the further delusion that taxing only the rich can fund its planned bounty of increased public spending.</p>
      <p>With more than £60bn a year of tax revenues to find, the Lib Dems have resorted to claiming that much of the money will come from clamping down on avoidance. Their leader Jo Swinson also obfuscated this week when she told the CBI employers’ organisation that scrapping business rates and replacing them with a commercial landowner levy would “shift the burden from the tenant to the landlord”. It would not. Rents would rise.</p>
      <p>Taxes are not for everybody else to contribute. They are for us. They enable government to create a civilised society, and one that protects us when others might do us harm. They provide the funds to educate us, insurance against illness and they foster better economic performance while absorbing some of the inevitable shocks.</p>
      <p>If voters are unhappy that public services are not up to scratch, politicians should tell the truth. The UK can devote more of national income to these essentials, but that requires less consumption of private goods and services. Moreover, everyone who has a stake in society should pay. Naturally, there is a question of who should shoulder the greatest burden. That depends on trends in incomes, wealth and on striking a reasonable balance between efficiency of revenue raising and fairness.</p>
      <p>With little change in income or wealth inequality over 30 years, the case for making the state much more redistributive is weak. The main shift over the past two decades has been a relative improvement in the income of the elderly, the wealth of pensioners and the size of estates. These groups would be the most natural target for higher taxes, but politicians of all colours do not dare.</p>
      <p>So, Britain has a choice. Politicians can seek a consensus around the fact that all need to pay more. The alternative is to keep pretending that tax is largely a matter for others. All parties have chosen this latter, expedient option. We should recognise, however, that this route ends with a general unwillingness to pay for the public services we value. That harms us all.</p>
