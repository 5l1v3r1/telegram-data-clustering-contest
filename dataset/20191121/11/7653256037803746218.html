      <p>NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday referred a bill, which seeks to ban commercial <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/surrogacy">surrogacy</a> in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/India">India</a>, to a 23-member select committee of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajya-Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a>.</p>
      <p>Union Health Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Harsh-Vardhan">Harsh Vardhan</a> moved a motion in the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/upper-house-of-Parliament">upper house of Parliament</a> referring the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, to the select committee. The members approved the motion by voice vote.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha members had on Wednesday sought amendments in certain provisions of the bill like the ones which only allow a close relative to act as a surrogate to couples who have been legally married for at least five years.</p>
      <p>The members had expressed their reservation on the condition of close relative and five year of marriage of commissioning parents.</p>
      <p>"I move the motion that Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019... as passed by Lok Sabha be referred to a select committee of the Rajya Sabha consisting of following members," Vardhan said.</p>
      <p>The members are Bhupender Yadav, Vikash Mahatme, Saroj Pandey, Ashwani Vaishnav, Jairam Ramesh, Amee Yajnik, A R Biswas, A Navaneethakrishnan, Ravi Prakash Verma, Prasanna Acharya, Ramchandra Prasad Singh, Banda Prakash, K Somaprasad, R S Bharathi, Veer Singh, Vandana Chavan, Anil Desai, Naresh Gujral, Sushil Kumar Gupta, V Vijayasai Reddy, Hishey Lachungpa, Parimal Nathwani and Sambhaji Chhatrapati.</p>
      <p>The minister also told the House the panel has been instructed to submit its report to Rajya Sabha by the last day of last week of the next session.</p>
      <p>However, Vardhan did not name the chairman of the committee.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said that the head of the committee would also attach an annexure in its report, providing details of the number of members attending the meetings of the panel.</p>
