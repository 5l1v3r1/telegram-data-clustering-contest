      <p>There are six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year than last. It's the shortest holiday shopping season since 2013.</p>
      <p>So what?</p>
      <p>Retailers, advertisers and the media are making a big deal out of it. But what does the shorter shopping season mean for you, the Christmas shopper?</p>
      <p>Does it give you six fewer days to procrastinate before you head out on Christmas Eve? Six fewer days to agonize over what to buy your mom before just grabbing another pair of slippers and a robe? Or six fewer days to white knuckle the gifts you've been holding onto since last January's clearance sales, doing everything you can not to give them to your loved ones early, thereby having to shop all over again?</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, chances are you'll be spending this shopping season the same way you spent last year's. And the one before that and the one before that.</p>
      <p>People's holiday shopping habits remain pretty consistent.</p>
      <p>Shopper surveys from the National Retail Federation show that people have preferences about when they do their Christmas shopping and pretty much stick to it no matter where Thanksgiving lands.</p>
      <p>Like previous years, 39% of shoppers began shopping before the end of October. That's a big chunk of folks unaffected by Thanksgiving's location on the calendar. Another 18% of shoppers will wait until December rolls around to start buying gifts. That's another group of folks who don't plan their shopping around turkey day. The rest of the people surveyed simply said they will start shopping sometime during November.</p>

      <p>Of course, shopping is barely even tied to Thanksgiving anymore. Black Friday is no longer a day, it's a season. Retailers have been pushing out deals since October.</p>
      <p>And it's not just hype designed to make you spend â€“ they're rolling out the deals, too. Retailers used to wait to offer those specials until after Thanksgiving, when people were in a spending mindset. It worked both ways: People were ready to shop after Thanksgiving, so that's when stores offered holiday deals. And the holiday deals arrived after Thanksgiving, so that's when people shopped.</p>
      <p>But now, retailers launch Black Friday sales Nov. 1 (or earlier!) in order to manufacture that holiday momentum and kick you into shopping mode sooner. For shopping-minded people, or people who are inclined to grab a good deal when they see one, Christmas is dancing in their heads far earlier than Thanksgiving Day.</p>
      <p>Still, emotions are a big factor when it comes to holiday shopping. Many people simply will not catch the Christmas spirit until Thanksgiving has come and gone. That could put them in a time crunch and, worse, put them in a budget crunch. If a person gets paid on Fridays, it leaves just four paychecks in the interim.</p>
      <p>Speaking of paychecks, we haven't even spoken about how people will pay for their holiday purchases.</p>
      <p>Sure, Christmas comes every year and is a predictable, logical expense that can be planned for. But you know what's not predictable or logical? Human behavior when it comes to personal finance. Trust me, I'm the Discount Diva and even I do plenty of stupid things.</p>
      <p>More than 71% of shoppers will pay for Christmas expenses on credit this year, according to a survey by personal finance site NerdWallet. Even scarier, a whopping 48 million people are still paying off debt they racked up during the holidays in 2018.</p>
      <p>Now do you see why I bug you with at least one early Christmas column each year, nudging you to get moving?</p>
