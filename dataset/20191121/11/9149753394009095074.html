      <p>You don't need polygons or voice acting to make a great comedy game, as <a href="https://kittenm4ster.itch.io/abc">Alfonzo's Bowling Challenge</a> aptly illustrates. It's a silly, funny, free browser game that's about bowling and (wink wink) absolutely nothing else. In it, you lift and slide a bowling ball around a bunch of cluttered stages, in response to challenges set by Alfonzo. As I cleared each level, and saw what the next had in store for me, a huge smile would invariably spread over my face.</p>
      <p>That was thanks to the dialogue and the pixel art, mainly. Alfonzo's winning expressions as he reacted to my performance, and the increasing ridiculousness of the text that appeared on-screen. But it was also down to the chirpily catchy, jazzy background muzak, which reminded me a little of the distinctive Wii eShop music.</p>
      <p>Alfonzo's Bowling Challenge lasts for around ten minutes. The nonsense progresses beautifully, culminating in...well, I won't spoil it, but like the best games it doesn't overstay its welcome. Give this a play if you like Frog Fractions, and other silly, surprising games.
