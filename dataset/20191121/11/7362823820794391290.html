      <p>U.S. women’s soccer star <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/carli-lloyd">Carli Lloyd</a> said Wednesday she is serious about pursuing an NFL kicking career and will start her journey following the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/olympics">2020 Olympics</a>.</p>
      <p>Lloyd said in a radio interview on “The Rich Eisen Show” that her kicking in the NFL wasn’t a “publicity stunt.”</p>

      <p>“This isn’t just a publicity stunt or something that I’m having fun, just string the media along. I know that I can do it,” the two-time Women’s World Cup champion said. “I know that I have the mental capacity in pressure situations. I know that there would be loads of people that want to see me fail. That’s no different than the entirety of my career.”</p>

      <p>Lloyd said she’s kicked in full gear before but is hoping to take some time to get the process down before going for a job. She said at this point she’s looking to make the 2020 Olympic soccer team before trying to get a job with an NFL team.</p>

      <p>The Olympics begin July 24 and end Aug. 9. The 2020 NFL preseason begins Aug. 6.</p>
      <p>“I definitely want to entertain it, but I want to be good at it,” she said. “I want to be able to do it. That’s ultimately what it comes down to. There’s obviously a lot of other things that are a bit challenging, with big men on the line and people running at you.”</p>
