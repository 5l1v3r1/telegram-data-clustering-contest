      <p>When it comes to a high refresh rate display, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/razer/">Razer</a> was the first one to implement a 120Hz display on its gaming device back in 2017. It seems like the year 2020 will see more and more OEMs opting for the 120Hz refresh rate experience. According to the recent emerging report, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/samsung/">Samsung</a> might also be planning to update its screen for the next Galaxy S11 lineup. If that’s the case, this will be the first Samsung smartphone to come with a massive 120Hz refresh rate.</p>

      <p>A reliable Twitter user who goes by the name Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) recently posted a screenshot of the hidden setting option on a Twitter thread. The screenshot is taken from the One UI 2.0 Beta update which recently was rolled out for Galaxy Note 9 in China. The discovered setting option gives users an option to choose between the traditional 60Hz or the all-new 120Hz refresh rate. The hidden menu contains three options. The first one selects the low 60Hz refresh while the second one will switch it to 120Hz. The third one, on the other hand, will automatically switch between these two rates to save up the battery whenever possible.</p>
      <p>It is worth mentioning that no <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/21/samsung-galaxy-s10-lite-appears-on-fcc-confirmed-to-use-a-6-7-inch-screen/">Samsung flagship smartphone</a> features a 120Hz display panel. This suggests that the smartphone maker, indeed, is planning to upgrade its display technology for the next S lineup. We are already aware of the fact that the brand might use the SAMOLED branding for the upcoming display. Apart from Samsung, major manufacturers such as Apple and OnePlus are also planning to introduce high 120Hz refresh rate displays to their 2020 flagship offering.</p>
      <h3>Expected Specs, Features</h3>
      <p>If the recent leaks and rumors are to be believed, Samsung Galaxy S11 will come with slimmer bezels and SAMOLED display branding. Furthermore, the device will introduce 8K video capture along with few new camera modes such as Director’s View, Night Hyperlapse and Single Take Photo. The device will likely come in three different sizes along with five variants including 5G.</p>
