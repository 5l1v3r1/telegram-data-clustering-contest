      <p>Prue Leith has sparked outrage among Good Morning Britain viewers as she believes that there should be a ban on school packed lunches.</p>
      <p>The Great British Bake Off judge - who replaced Mary Berry on the show - took to the breakfast show earlier today alongside Ben Shephard and Susanna Reid to voice her opinion.</p>
      <p>She told the TV duo how lunchtime should become a lesson in teaching children about healthy eating.</p>
      <p>The 74-year-old also said how banning lunches brought in from home would be a good way to tackle the obesity crisis.</p>

        <figcaption>Prue thinks schools should teach children more about healthy eating.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Speaking to Ben and Susanna, she said: "Some mums do really, really well. But most people don't, they fill lunch boxes with junk.</p>
      <p>"If I was doing a packed lunch I'd be tempted to put in some little treat, but a treat should be once a week not everyday.</p>
      <p>"I feel we should ban packed lunches, but it has to be in combination with teaching children about food with a real effort from the school - we need to teach children at school about eating healthily."</p>
      <p>She continued: "I think if you have more than one sweet thing a day you are adding 400 cal to your days.</p>
      <p>"Chocolate and chips aren't bad, you just don't want it every day."</p>

      <p>However, The Sunday Times education and families editor Sian Griffiths - who also guest appeared on the show - quickly hit back and claimed that such a ban would be "terrible".</p>
      <p>She said: "I don't think banning packed lunches is a good idea.</p>
      <p>"A lot of school food is absolutely terrible. I go to schools a lot and just this week I was offered fish fingers, pizza, fried fish in batter and sausages and that's not health food.</p>
      <p>"I think schools have got so much on their plate."</p>

      <p>Sian questioned why Prue thinks a packed lunch ban would be useful: "Do you not see some conflict here, as you are a judge on The Great British Bake Off?"</p>
      <p>The baking show judge then shot back: "Of course it is a very obvious one, but that is a competition.</p>
      <p>"Mothers shouldn't put a treat in to the lunches every week. I want to see lunches as a lesson.</p>
      <p>"In Finland the children sit down and are taught a lot about food, they are sitting down with teachers and they are learning, they don't know it is a lesson - it should be relaxing."</p>

      <p>Lots of ITV viewers took to Twitter to express their thoughts on Prue's claims, with many outraged.</p>
      <p>One posted: "Everyday in school dinners they get a pudding, but kids on packed lunches should get a sweet treat once a week?"</p>
      <p>Another fumed: "What a load of rubbish."</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "Ban packed lunches? Have you seen the price of school dinners!????" a second asked.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another added: " Woman who eats cakes for a living tries to ban packed lunches as they're 'unhealthy'."</p>
