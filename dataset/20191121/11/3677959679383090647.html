      <p>Pokemon Sword And Shield are setting out to be extremely successful, despite the controversy that surrounds the two games.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, The Pokemon Company issued a new <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1197447168304537600">statement</a> revealing that Pokemon Sword And Shield sold 6 million copies since release, 2 million copies in Japan alone. This makes the new entry in the Pokemon series the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch title so far, doubling first week sales of the Pokemon Let's Go games, and selling 1 million more than Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.</p>

      <p>Pokemon Sword and Shield feature a brand new region as well as new gameplay mechanics and plenty of new Pokemon. Sadly, not all of the Pokemon created so far are included, something that most fans aren't pleased with. Some of the missing Pokemon, however, are being<a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-missing-pokemon-modders/"> added to the games</a> by modders.</p>
      <blockquote>A new generation of Pokemon is coming to the Nintendo Switch system with Pokemon Sword And Shield. Become a Pokémon Trainer, embark on a new journey in the new Galar region, and unravel the mystery behind the Legendary Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenta! Explore the Wild Area, a vast expanse of land with free camera control. And participate in Max Raid Battles in which players will face off against gigantic and super-strong Pokemon known as Dynamax Pokemon.<br/>Certain Pokemon can even Gigantamax to gain a new look and a powerful set of G-Max moves. But there’s more to being a champion than honing your battle skills: you can pick your own clothes and get a new hairdo while visiting the stores in town, so you can be the Trainer you want to be. Throughout your journey, you’ll encounter newly discovered Pokémon as well as familiar ones that will look a little different in their new Galarian forms! And for another way to level up your Pokemon, assign them Poke Jobs to complete. You can even play with your Pokemon in Pokemon Camp, just for fun!</blockquote>
      <p>Pokemon Sword And Shield are now available worldwide on Nintendo Switch.</p>
