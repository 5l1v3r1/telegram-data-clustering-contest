      <p>Microsoft is currently in the process of fulfilling one of their earlier promises, which was to introduce new modern office icons across all platforms. The company <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-has-debuted-new-colourful-icons-for-office/">announced the new modern Office icons in the month of November last year</a>. The software giant has since then been rolling out the new icons for its office app in a phased manner.</p>
      <p>It’s not just the icon of Office that Microsoft is planning to revamp, the company is also working on new icons for File Explorer, Mail and Calendar, Calculator, Camera, Paint, Photos and more. These new icons are fluent design-based and are expected to debut in Windows 10 X OS.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, it seems that Microsoft is not happy with how the icon for Photos app look at this moment, and, therefore, wants to introduce a new icon.</p>
