      <p>Former Minister and Congress MLA Tanveer Sait on Thursday underwent a minor surgery on his left earlobe. He is stable and responding to treatment, doctors said.</p>
      <p>The left earlobe was cut during <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tanveer-sait-critical-after-assault/article30013827.ece">the brutal assault on him recently</a> and was stitched up by the doctors treating him at Columbia Asia Hospital here.</p>
      <p>Under local anaesthesia, the sutured earlobe was removed since the area had darkened. The earlobe cannot be sutured again, and the former minister may have to undergo plastic surgery at a later stage for its reconstruction.</p>
      <p>“The severed earlobe will not cause any hearing problem but the cut part would be visible until the plastic surgery,” according to Dr. Upendra Shenoy, Medical Superintendent, Columbia Asia Hospital, Mysuru. The cut earlobe was handed over to Mr. Sait’s family on its request, he added.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Neuro surgeon Dr. Maqsood Ahmed A.R. said Mr. Sait has developed a weak voice-box and this could be attributed to the swollen neck. This may become normal once the wound gets healed. “His voice is expected to become normal in about two week’s time,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sait had grievous injury to the blood vessels and nerves at the neck following a deep wound resulting from the assault using a machete.</p>
      <p>Doctors treating him said Mr. Sait may have suffered damage to his facial nerve causing some issues with normal lip movement while speaking. The problem won’t come in the way of his normal speech and eating food, said Dr. H.A. Dathathri, ENT surgeon.</p>
      <p>Dr. Shenoy said the former Minister’s blood pressure and kidney functions were also normal and is out of danger. “He may have to be in hospital until Tuesday and a decision on his discharge will be taken thereafter. After the discharge, he may have to take rest for at least a few weeks,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, former Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara and many former ministers visited the hospital on Thursday and enquired about Mr. Sait’s health.</p>
      <p>The police are also likely to step up security cover for Mr. Sait in the light of the attack on him. He had a gunman who was suspended for dereliction of duty. The former minister may get more than one gunmen who will be working in different shifts.</p>
