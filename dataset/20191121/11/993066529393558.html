      <p>Two men arrested over the 1999 murder of Jonathan Cairns have been released on police bail</p>
      <p>A 51-year-old man was arrested in the Limavady area and a 43-year-old in Ballykelly on suspicion of withholding information.</p>
      <p>Jonathan (18) was attacked and killed as he made his way home from a night out in the early hours of Sunday April 25 1999.</p>
      <p>His body was discovered in a shallow grave at Loughermore Forest close to his Ballykelly home. No-one has ever been convicted of the teenager’s murder although a 49-year-old man was sentenced to five years in prison in 2002 for perverting the course of justice.</p>
      <p>A 44-year-old woman arrested earlier this week on suspicion of murdering the teenager <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/2019/11/21/news/jonathan-cairns-murder-woman-released-on-bail-1771247/">has been released on bail</a>.</p>
