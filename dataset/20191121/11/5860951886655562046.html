      <p>The child returned to Clark County on Nov. 14 after travelling internationally to a country where a measles outbreak is occurring.</p>
      <p>People who visited the following locations may have been exposed to measles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Portland International Airport,</b> Concourse E, north end of lower level, including restrooms and baggage claim, from 10:30 am to noon Thursday, Nov. 14.</li>
        <li><b>PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center,</b> 400 NE Mother Joseph Place, Vancouver from 12:45 to 5:05 pm Thursday, Nov. 14.</li>
        <li><b>Randall Children’s Hospital at Legacy Emanuel,</b> 2801 N Gantenbein Ave., Portland from 11:50 pm Saturday, Nov. 16 to 4:25 am Sunday, Nov. 17.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Clark County Public Health is advising anyone who may have been exposed and believes they have symptoms of measles to call their health care provider prior to visiting the medical office to make a plan that avoids exposing others in the waiting room. Those who are susceptible and were exposed could develop symptoms from Nov. 18 to Dec. 9.</p>
      <p>“This is an unfortunate reminder that measles is only a plane, car, bus or train ride away,” said Dr. Alan Melnick, Clark County Public Health director and county health officer. “Immunization is the best way to protect yourself and the community from measles.”</p>
      <p>One dose of the measles vaccine is about 93 percent effective at preventing measles. Two doses are about 97 percent effective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
