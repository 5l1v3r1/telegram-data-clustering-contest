      <p>Days after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced winners of the Bayelsa and Kogi governorship elections, senators elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have rejected the poll's results.</p>
      <p>The PDP lawmakers made their position regarding the elections known on Wednesday, November 20, at a news conference, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> reports that the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276529-bayelsa-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-governorship-poll.html">candidates of the APC in Bayelsa </a>and <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276445-kogi-election-yahaya-bello-scores-highest-votes-polls-406222-votes.html">Kogi won the gubernatorial elections</a>, according to INEC’s announcements.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the senators, the minority leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, said they were disturbed by the elections.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ababribe said they rejected the elections, alleging that the results announced by INEC did not reflect what actually happened on the field.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“We want to call the attention of Nigerians. We are very disturbed by the elections that were held last weekend in Bayelsa and Kogi.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“We totally reject the pronouncements after the elections by INEC and we are worried about the trend of what happened during the election.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We know that the results that were announced were not a true reflection of what happened in the field.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The minority leader said the elections indicated that the democratic achievements made by the PDP administration since 1999 are being upturned.</p>
      <p>However, the elections seem to have left the Senate divided as spokesman of the upper legislative chamber, Senator Godiya Akwashiki, had a different opinion.</p>
      <p>In his own reaction, Akwashiki said the elections have been conducted as the country’s Electoral Act stipulates and anyone that has grievances regarding the outcome “knows what to do”.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that Senator Melaye <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277013-kogi-election-dino-melaye-vows-report-governor-yahaya-bello-icc.html">threatened to report Governor Bello and other politicians in Kogi state </a>to the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the alleged violence that occurred during the senatorial and governorship election in the state. Melaye, who is currently battling to get re-elected in the National Assembly, is trailing his opponent, Smart Adeyemi in the Kogi west senatorial district rerun poll.</p>
      <p>But the lawmaker, in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, November 19, said what occurred in Kogi state was more of a civil war than an election.</p>
