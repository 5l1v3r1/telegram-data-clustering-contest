      <blockquote><b>IN FIRST-PERSON GAMES, GAMEPLAY COMES FIRST</b><br/><br/>While we want our animations to look cool, it’s more important to make sure that they communicate the action without getting in the way of the player.<br/><br/>A short, snappy, but otherwise boring animation can actually be better than a fancy one with lots of anticipation and flourish because your player is going to be watching it hundreds - if not thousands of times.<br/><br/>It might be fun the first couple of times, but after that, the distraction or extra time it takes can be frustrating. You don’t want to make your player wait around an extra second every time they do an action just so you can show off your cool skills.<br/><br/>That said, we want to try to use the limited time we have and make things feel fluid, natural and fun. Just be aware that it’s a secondary goal.</blockquote>
