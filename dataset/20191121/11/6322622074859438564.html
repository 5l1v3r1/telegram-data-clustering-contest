      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 21): Southern Steel Bhd started its financial year ending June 30, 2020 (FY20) in the red, as its first quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 recorded a net loss of RM45.59 million, dragged by lower sales volume and selling prices.</p>
      <p>This is the company’s fourth consecutive quarterly net loss, which brings its cumulative losses to RM166.42 million since 2QFY19.</p>
      <p>In the corresponding quarter a year ago of 1QFY19, the company, which is a member of the Hong Leong Group, recorded a net profit of RM1.79 million, onrevenue of RM929.04 million. Revenue has now fallen 30% to RM653.74 million.</p>
      <p>Southern Steel said the lower revenue and losses recorded in 1QFY20 were “largely due to lower selling prices which eroded margin and lower sales volume”.</p>
      <p>The company said it will continue to undertake measures to adopt cost and to maintain its market position, as the market continues to be “severely oversupplied”.</p>
      <p>Shares of Southern Steel closed unchanged today at 74 sen, for a market capitalisation of RM320.90 million. The stock has lost 35% over the past one year.</p>
