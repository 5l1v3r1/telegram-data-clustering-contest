      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to take on “vested interests” in society as he set out a radical programme to invest in public services, tackle climate change and re-nationalise key utilities.</p>
      <p>Launching Labour’s General Election manifesto in Birmingham, Mr Corbyn said they were offering an agenda for “real change” with policies the “political establishment” had blocked for a generation.</p>
      <p>The 105-page document set out plans for what the party said was the “largest scale investment programme in modern times” to fund the jobs and industries of the future.</p>

      <p>It includes:</p>
      <p>– A “green industrial revolution” to tackle climate change with a shift to renewables and creating a million new jobs.</p>
      <p>– Bringing back rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership and delivering full-fibre broadband free to everyone in the country</p>
      <p>– Introducing a “real living wage” of at least £10-an-hour while ending zero hours contracts and strengthening trade union rights</p>
      <p>– Creating a national education service providing through-life learning  and scrapping university tuition fees</p>
      <p>– Providing additional funding for the NHS and reversing a decade of cuts for the police.</p>
      <p>– Getting Brexit “sorted” within six months, giving the public the final say in a referendum.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said: “This manifesto is the most radical and ambitious plan to transform our country in decades.</p>
      <p>“In an election offering a once-in-a-generation chance of real change we can end privatisation and rescue our NHS.</p>
      <p>“We can get Brexit sorted and bring our country together.</p>
      <p>“We can tackle the climate emergency that threatens us all. And we can rewrite the rules of our economy to work for the many, not the few.”</p>
      <p>In a combative performance, the Labour leader acknowledged that their plans would put them at odds with “the bankers, billionaires and the establishment.</p>
      <p>“They know we will deliver our plans, which is why they want to stop us being elected,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They know we will go after the tax dodgers, the bad bosses and the big polluters so that everybody in our country gets a fair chance in life.</p>
      <p>“That’s why they throw everything they’ve got at us. Because they’re scared of real change. Because they aren’t on your side.”</p>
      <p>The manifesto said that a Labour government would “re-write the rules of the economy” by taxing “those at the top” to properly fund public services.</p>
      <p>It would reverse cuts to public sector pay with above-inflation pay rises year-on-year, paid for by an increase in taxes for those earning more than £80,000 while freezing rates for everyone else.</p>

      <p>Labour is pledging to embark on a council and social housing “revolution” by constructing up to 150,000 homes a year in what the party says is the biggest building programme in decades.</p>
      <p>On climate change, the manifesto stops short of a commitment to make the economy carbon neutral by 2030 as the party conference had called for.</p>
      <p>Instead it promises a “green new deal” which would aim to achieve “the substantial majority of our emissions” reductions by 2030.</p>
      <p>The manifesto also stops short of supporting continued freedom of movement if the country were to vote again for Brexit in a referendum.</p>
      <p>If the UK does leave the EU, it says future policy would be “subject to negotiations” while recognising the social and economic benefits free movement had brought.</p>
      <p>For the Tories, Home Office Minister Brandon Lewis said the manifesto showed that Mr Corbyn had no plan for Brexit.</p>
      <p>“Without a plan to get Brexit done he has no credibility on anything else,” he said.</p>
      <p>“A Labour government would mean unlimited and uncontrolled immigration putting pressure on our public services and a reckless spending spree which would take a sledgehammer to the British economy and cost every taxpayer £2,400 a year.”</p>
