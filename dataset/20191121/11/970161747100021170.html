      <p>The home secretary has come under fire for saying poverty is not the government’s fault, despite years of Tory austerity cuts.</p>
      <p>Priti Patel denied the government had any responsibility for children being born into destitution, instead blaming councils and locally run public services.</p>
      <p>In a clip being widely shared on Twitter, Ms Patel is seen during a visit to Barrow, in Cumbria, where she is told four in 10 children are born into poverty.</p>
      <p>Ms Patel told BBC North West: ‘Well it’s not the government though, is it?</p>
      <p>‘Everybody says it’s the government as if it’s this bland blob that you can just go and blame.</p>
      <p>‘It’s all parts of society and the structures, local authorities have a role to play, education, public services which are locally led and locally run.’</p>

      <p>Local councils have faced years of cuts under the government’s austerity measures following the recession.</p>

      <p>According to the Local Government Association, in the decade to 2020, local authorities will have faced a reduction of funding from the government of nearly £16 billion.</p>
      <p>Last year, the UN reported that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/19/there-are-14000000-in-poverty-in-britain-because-of-austerity-un-says-8154144/">14 million people in the UK are in poverty</a> as a direct result of government austerity.</p>
      <p>In particular, the introduction of Universal Credit had caused ‘extreme hardship’ UN Special Rapporteur on poverty and human rights Professor Philip Alston said.</p>
      <p>According to his report, of the 14 million people in poverty, 1.5 million were classed as destitute and unable to afford basic essentials.</p>

      <p>Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer tweeted that her words showed Ms Patel ‘is completely out of touch’.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I blame austerity for the rise in poverty and I blame this Tory government for austerity.’</p>
      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the claims ‘are yet another example of the Tory Government’s cruelty’.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, he said: ‘Local Government has suffered enormously from vicious Tory cuts. Of course we can blame the Tory Government for poverty.’</p>
