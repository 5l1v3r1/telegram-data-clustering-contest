      <p>MOSCOW, Nov 21 — Malaysia will invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to participate in the 2020 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit that the South-east Asian nation will host, Sputnik news agency quoted Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah as saying today.</p>
      <p>“We, of course, will welcome President Putin’s involvement in the Apec 2020 that Malaysia is hosting next year in November,” Saifuddin said after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.</p>
