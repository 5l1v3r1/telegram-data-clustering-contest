          </p>
          <p>With today’s opponents having played the eight matches and having managed to fathom just the two wins in between them, the number is one which clearly alludes towards how arduous things have been for both the units. Slumped in the trenches of the league standings, for sixth paled Qalandars and seventh place Karnataka Tuskers know that when the two meet today, a defeat for either could end up spelling the demise of their outing in the T10 league.</p>
          <p>Karnataka Tuskers come into today’s contest having survived what looked to be a certain defeat after widespread rainfall intervened to lash the surface and rescue them from the aberration of chasing down the 130 run target on the scoreboard. It was a horrendous bowling display by the side, one which saw them ship runs at will to Maratha Arabians as ther bowling acumen vanished up in smoke.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere, with the one win in four matches, Qalandars come into today’s contest having lost their way against Deccan Gladiators with the side floundering in their run chase. Needing 129 to win, the side were refrained and curbed to just 104, a 24 run defeat which continued to refrain them from moving up the points tally, making today’s match a must win one for them if they are to stay alive in the showpiece league.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>With there being extremely little cricket being played over here yesterday, an already sublime batting track will fare even better with the ground team getting the much needed time to work on this track. This is a clash which promises to be a high scoring affair with the side winning the toss set to come out and chase today with the surface set to retain its identity across the full course of the 20 overs.</p>

                            <h3>KAT vs QAL Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>For the first time in this edition of the T10 league, we’ll be moving in with all the available options in the wicket-keeping slot as we heavily bolster up our docket. We are moving in with the two picks from Karnataka Tuskers, brining in the ever reliable and dependable Johnson Charles, someone who has imbedded in place succulent displays to lay down the pinch perfect foundation at the top of the order for his side.</p>
                            <p>Shafiqullah Shafiq will be partnering him up for this clash while from the opposition we are moving in with their opener Luke Ronchi. He managed to get just 17 runs in the last outing but it was a knock which spoke about the expansive skill set the bat comes bearing in his artillery to see us repose faith in him for this clash.</p>
                            <p>His counterpart and Qalandars second opener, Tom Banton will be partnering him up for the day alongside Philip Salt who scored 25 runs in the side’s most recent outing in the league. Dawid Malan, the side’s captain comes in as well to complete the trivalent of options for us with the bat being not only the side’s most sublime bat but one of the most tenacious batsmen across the course of the league.</p>
                            <p>He took just 25 balls to score 48 runs the last time around and up against an inclement and floundering bowling setup, we envisage him emulating the same rampant display today as well. Meanwhile from the other side of the slot, we have ventured in with just the one player with opener Hashim Amla being our choice for today’s encounter.</p>
                            <h3>KAT vs QAL Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>At a time when the side’s bowling unit fell apart to imbed in place a tinker of a performance, George Garton showed the stomach for a fight as the player punched above his weight. He ended up tallying figures of 3-21, a spell which saw him rise to the occasion and drub the opposition with rippers to become our singular pick from Qalandars for this encounter.</p>
                            <h3>KAT vs QAL Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>After being in sublime touch in the Super50 Cup, Kesrick Williams played his first match for Karnataka Tuskers yesterday and although he was peeled off for a slew of runs, we’ll e entrusting him as our pick for this match. The quick is some capable of persistently pitching the ball in the right channels and spots, something which makes him a tricky and dicey bowler to get under.</p>
                            <p>From the opposition meanwhile, we begin with their leading wicket taker in the form of Lahiru Kumara with Sultan Ahmed giving him company for the day.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Dawid is our undisputed captain for the fixture whilst Charles is being made our vice-captain.</p>
