      <p>It’s been a few years since we’ve heard any new music from Courtney Love, but on Thursday the former Hole frontwoman unveiled a grunge-infused new track that hearkens back to her 1990s sound.</p>
      <p>The new song, “Mother”, comes from the soundtrack for the upcoming film “The Turning”, starring Finn Wolfhard (“Stranger Things”) and Mackenzie Davis (“Terminator: Dark Fate”), based on Henry James’ novella <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/original-hole-line-up-reunites-for-rehearsal-session-in-la-2555340#Qlyp90qq6Ym1irP9.99">NME</a></i>, the film’s soundtrack (set to be released on Jan. 24) also features new tracks from Mitski, Soccer Mommy, Warpaint, Kali Uchis, Kim Gordon, and Wolfhard’s band the Aubreys.</p>

      <p>As <i>NME</i> reports, “The Turning” director Floria Sigismondi went to singer-songwriter Lawrence Rothman, asking him to write an original song for the movie. Rothman then went to Love, knowing she was a fan of the story.</p>
      <p>“I read <i>The Turn of the Screw</i> as a kid, so it’s a genuine privilege to have had the opportunity to work with the genius that is Floria Sigismondi and Lawrence Rothman on this soundtrack — especially as I’m alongside so many other fantastic female artists I respect,” said Love, citing Sigismondi’s earlier work directing music videos.</p>
      <p>“I’ve long admired her work, particularly the Runaways and the Marilyn Manson videos,” added Love. “Floria and Lawrence had a clear vision on what they wanted to achieve and it was an honour to be invited into their studio and to become a part of it.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, there may be even more music from Love arriving in the near future. Last month, <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/original-hole-line-up-reunites-for-rehearsal-session-in-la-2555340#Qlyp90qq6Ym1irP9.99">NME</a> </i>reported that she teased a Hole reunion in a since-deleted Instagram post, writing, “Whose rusty af? Ladies !!!” along with the hashtags “#hole #rehearsal #tonight #hollywood.”</p>
      <p>She followed that up by responding to a comment by seemingly confirming a Hole reunion was in the works. “Ah! We r so rusty. Just finding our way through songs n songs we like n riffs seeing what’s what! It’s cool. Af nice to be together.”</p>
