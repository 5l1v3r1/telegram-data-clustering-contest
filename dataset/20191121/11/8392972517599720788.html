      </p>
      <p>Earlier in the show, Andrew tried to make peace with campmate Jacqueline Jossa after they clashed.</p>
      <p>Speaking about not putting pressure on each other when it comes to the Bushtucker trials, Jacqueline said: "I was panicking so much yesterday and it didn't make it better people going if you don't even try we're going to get nothing.</p>
      <p>"That doesn't make it better.  It makes it ten times worse.  In fact it made me want to go I'm not doing it.  If someone can't do it, they can't do it."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Andrew cut in: "Was that was me you were talking about?" to which Jacqueline confirmed it was.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'd just been through a really horrific thing but I didn't want to put pressure on you.</p>
      <p>"I won't do that again.  We're all still learning on the job."</p>
