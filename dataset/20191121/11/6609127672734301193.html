      <p>Dundee Sheriff Court heard the pair were friends but had fallen out over Gaffar's ex-boyfriend.</p>
      <p>The court was told victim Strachan required plastic surgery as a result of the assault and also how Gaffar received death threats as a result of the publicity of the case.</p>
      <p>Gaffar, of Tealing, pled guilty to grabbing Miss Strachan by the hair, forcing her to the ground, striking her head off the ground, putting her arm around her throat, restricting her breathing and biting her to her severe injury and permanent disfigurement on February 3.</p>
