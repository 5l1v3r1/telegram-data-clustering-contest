      <p>REUTERS: Players in the top two divisions of Dutch football will stand still for the first minute of matches this weekend as a protest against racism, the top flight Eredivisie has said https://eredivisie.nl/nl-nl/nieuwsbericht/profclubs-houden-een-minuut-benen-stil-tegen-racisme.</p>
      <p>An anti-racism message will be also displayed on scoreboards during the opening minute at Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie games and an extra minute will be added to first half injury time.</p>

      <p>The move comes after Excelsior forward Ahmad Mendes Moreira was racially abused by a section of FC Den Bosch supporters last weekend, with the game suspended for half an hour after the referee decided to take the players off the pitch.</p>
      <p>The Dutch football association has said it would investigate the incident and look into possible sanctions against Den Bosch and its supporters.</p>
      <p>A series of racist incidents has tainted European football recently.</p>
      <p>Italian striker Mario Balotelli threatened to walk off the pitch after receiving alleged racist abuse earlier this month while Shakhtar Donetsk forward Taison was shown a red card for reacting to racist jeers from the crowd during a match.</p>
