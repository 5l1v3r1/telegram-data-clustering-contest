      <h1>The Left Shouldn’t Freak Out About Trump’s Judges (Yet)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:00:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin J. Siegel</a></address>
      <p>Republicans are celebrating how they’ve packed the 12 <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure">regional federal appeals courts</a> (excluding a specialized federal appellate court)<b> </b>with conservative judges. Earlier this month, President Trump hosted Senate Republicans at the White House to cheer their 45th confirmation. Stephen Bannon recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/the-weekly/don-mcgahn-trump-courts.html?module=inline">said</a>, in praising Don McGahn, the former White House counsel who chose many of the new appointees, “Why the left is triggered by Trump is because they understand they’re in a Kafkaesque nightmare, that Donald Trump is going to be in their personal lives 10, 20 and 30 years from now.”</p>
      <p>Yes, it should embarrass Senate Republicans that their signature achievement is confirming their own president’s nominees, something that used to be taken for granted. Yet there’s no denying that the slew of new appellate judges is genuine reason for progressive angst. In nearly 34 months, President Trump has filled over one-quarter of these benches. At a roughly comparable point in 2011, President Barack Obama had appointed only 19, and he named only 55 altogether. Three appellate courts have flipped from a majority of judges appointed by Democratic presidents to a majority appointed by Republicans.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, most of the new appointees are young and seem to have been selected for their ideological bona fides. Many have held political jobs in the Trump administration or Republican state governments, clerked for one of the conservative justices on the Supreme Court or belong to the Federalist Society, or some combination of the above.</p>
      <p>But if the courthouse cloud is dark for liberals, there are silver linings. Most of the new judges are replacing Republican-appointed predecessors, and the regional circuits are nearly even, seven Republican majority and five Democratic, with the three flipped Republican courts closely split. The overall number of Republican-appointed circuit judges has edged ahead of Democratic-appointed ones, but the difference isn’t vast. For the moment, the courts are more mixed, not irretrievably lost.</p>
      <p>History also suggests that, over time, some of these shining conservative stars will redirect their light. At first, appellate judges tend to mirror their political party and patrons. But as time passes, independence and confidence grow. Some hot-button priorities at the time of appointment fade, while new ones appear, complicating predictability. And doctrines advocated by one side can unexpectedly be repurposed by the other. In the pending Supreme Court case asking whether federal law forbids discrimination against gay employees, L.G.B.T.Q. advocates emphasized precedent from Justice Antonin Scalia, a celebrated conservative, on how to interpret statutes.</p>
      <p>Supreme Court history is full of ideological surprises, as illustrated by Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter — Republican appointees who either drifted left or disappointed conservatives by supporting certain major liberal decisions. There are equally striking if less-well-known examples of lower court judges going rogue.</p>
      <p>Like the Trumpers, the Reagan administration made it a project to appoint young conservatives, hoping to reverse decades of liberal rulings. Richard Posner, then 42 and a leading light of the conservative “law and economics” school, was one of its first appointees, to the Seventh Circuit. Decades later, he wrote decisions recognizing gay marriage and striking down abortion restrictions. “I’ve become less conservative since the Republican Party started becoming goofy,” he <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/07/05/156319272/federal-judge-richard-posner-the-gop-has-made-me-less-conservative">told</a> NPR’s Nina Totenberg.</p>
      <p>Patrick Higginbotham was named to the Fifth Circuit by President Reagan at 43. In the past few years, he has voted to uphold the University of Texas’ affirmative action program and dissented from a ruling targeting abortion providers in Louisiana.</p>
      <p>J. Harvie Wilkinson joined the Fourth Circuit in 1984 at 39. While Judge Wilkinson has remained generally conservative, he also <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1265118">castigated</a> the Supreme Court decision establishing a right to personal gun ownership as an illegitimate judicial fiat tying the hands of legislators trying to address gun violence.</p>
      <p>My old law professor John T. Noonan wasn’t one of President Reagan’s younger appointees (at age 59), but he joined the Ninth Circuit in 1985 and often signed liberal decisions in criminal and immigration cases. In 2002, he wrote a book criticizing the Supreme Court’s decisions favoring states’ rights over congressional power. Mr. Reagan would have blanched.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, these judges are exceptions, not the rule. They aren’t liberal, just heterodox, and today’s appointees may be better vetted or truer believers. But they demonstrate that the Republican victory now being celebrated may not prove quite as sweeping as the gloaters imagine.</p>
      <p>Finally, there’s one more silver lining, and maybe the most important: Democrats will get even.</p>
      <p>Why is President Trump filling so many vacancies? Because Republicans stalled Obama nominees and then abandoned the custom of deferring to the wishes of home state senators, which would have blocked or modified Trump nominees in blue states.</p>
      <p>The Fifth Circuit is a prime example. That court, which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, has leaned right for three decades largely because Texas’ Republican senators blocked all but one actual or potential Democratic appointees from that state since 1995, and Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama let them get away with it. Unlike Mitch McConnell, Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, was too wedded to Senate tradition to challenge the traditional veto enjoyed by home state senators, and the seats remained empty until 2017.</p>
      <p>As a matter of process, the Republicans’ current approach is actually preferable. Senators <i>shouldn’t </i>be able to frustrate a president’s constitutional authority to appoint judges and hold seats open for future administrations. But as a matter of politics, Republicans may come to rue their current greediness. When Democrats next control the White House and the Senate, appellate seats in red states will be filled as quickly and with as little input from the other side as Republicans are doing now. Expect fewer apolitical, consensus choices, too — the usual ex-prosecutors and corporate law firm partners. More nominees will hail from liberal advocacy groups, academia and energetically progressive federal agencies and state governments.</p>
      <p>There are no permanent victories in politics — or law.</p>
