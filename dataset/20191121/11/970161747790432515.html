        <b>Liverpool are tracking the progress of Brighton defender Ben White, who is currently earning rave reviews for his performances on loan at Leeds United in the Championship.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has made 13 appearances for the Yorkshire club this season as they challenge for a return to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s side have the best defence in the Championship, conceding just nine goals in 16 league games and White has been credited for his part in this rock solid back line.</p>
      <p>White has never made an appearance for his parent club, but has also spent time on loan at Newport County and Peterborough.</p>
      <p>Now he is attracting the attention of some of the biggest clubs in the country, with the <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1384972/2019/11/20/a-white-wall-how-bielsa-built-the-football-leagues-meanest-defence-around-a-22-year-old-who-is-tempting-liverpool/">Athletic</a> reporting that Manchester United have been scouting the defender and Liverpool have a ‘genuine interest’ in him.</p>

      <p>French goalkeeper Illan Meslier, who is also on loan at Elland Road, said of White: ‘He’s unbelievable. He’s off to a good start to the season.</p>
      <p>‘Last year I think he was in League One. This is his first year in the Championship and he’s shown he’s at that level. Brighton has a very good player on its hands.’</p>
      <p>Brighton boss Graham Potter is also well aware of the progress he is making on loan as he gains more first team experience.</p>
      <p>‘The feedback about Ben has been really good, and we’re happy with how he’s done so far,’ Potter told Brighton’s official website. ‘It’s really good for him and Leeds United too, because it shows that the loan has worked well for everybody.</p>
      <p>‘He was a player that was really after first-team football and he’s got that opportunity there. Of course he’s still our player, but we’re happy that he’s having a good experience and getting better all the time, so we’re delighted.’</p>
      <p>White is on loan at Leeds for the season and is unlikely to be recalled by Brighton before that, with suitors likely to have to pay around £20m for his services in the summer.</p>
