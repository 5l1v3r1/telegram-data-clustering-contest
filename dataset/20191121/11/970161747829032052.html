      <p>Rachel Riley has hit back at those criticising her for wearing a Photoshopped Jeremy Corbyn t-shirt, arguing that people are ranking one form of racism over another.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-sparks-backlash-erasing-jeremy-corbyns-anti-apartheid-message-photoshopped-t-shirt-11192944/">The 33-year-old wore a t-shirt on Tuesday night</a> showing a picture of Labour leader Corbyn being arrested at an anti-apartheid protest in 1984, with ‘Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour’ Photoshopped onto his sign.</p>
      <p>The original image showed Corbyn holding a placard reading: ‘‘Defend the right to demonstrate against apartheid; join this picket.’</p>
      <p>There have been calls for Rachel – who has been vocal in her opposition to Labour due to allegations of anti-Semitism in the party – to be sacked from Channel 4 due to her t-shirt, with many accusing her of erasing the anti-apartheid message.</p>
      <p>However, the Countdown star is not backing down.</p>

      <p>Rachel, who is heavily pregnant with her first child, quote-tweeted a post which alleged that Corbyn supported the Workers Revolutionary Party, led by Gerry Healy, as part of his time in CLAGG (City of London Anti-Apartheid Movement).</p>

      <p>The star tweeted: ‘The ease at which large swathes of people can be mobilised into group hate, for highlighting Corbyn’s history of racism using an image of his arrest as part of an extreme group cited as damaging the mainstream anti-apartheid movement, is just one reason Jewish people are worried.</p>
      <p>‘Trying to brand me as racist for this, whist lauding themselves as anti-racist heroes, shows just how little regard many people have for anti-Jewish racism, and why I and many others speak so loudly. It’s a hatred which unites the far right, far left and is having a resurgence.’</p>
      <p>Rachel continued: ‘I won’t dignify this with any further response &amp; I won’t tolerate abuse from those who choose to rank one form of racism over another, that’s hypocrisy. They’re all unacceptable. End of.’</p>

      <p>She then shared a graphic on how to tackle trolls, writing: ‘If this is what it takes to highlight the nastiness of these people then fine. This today.’</p>
      <p>However, her critics were not dissuaded, demanding an apology for the t-shirt and predicting she would be sacked.</p>
      <p>During the ITV Leader Debate between Corbyn and Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday night, Mr Corbyn said anti-Semitism was ‘an absolute evil and scourge within our society’ and insisted the party treated the issue ‘very, very seriously’.</p>
      <p>ITV host Julie Etchingham received a round of applause when she asked Mr Corbyn about a poll showing many Jewish people do not trust him over anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Labour leader replied: ‘I have taken action in my party, where anyone who has committed any anti-Semitic acts or made any anti-Semitic statements, they are either suspended or expelled from the party and we’ve investigated every single case.</p>
      <p>‘We do take this very seriously indeed.’ However, Mr Corbyn was again accused of anti-Semitism for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/jeremy-corbyn-accused-anti-semitism-pronunciation-epsteins-name-11186885/">his pronunciation of Jeffrey Epstein’s name during the debate.</a></p>
      <p>This comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/former-labour-mp-says-jeremy-corbyn-indulged-anti-semitic-activity-11127296/">former Labour MP Luciana Berger accused the party</a> of a ‘serious racist problem’ and said: ‘Jeremy Corbyn and his team have created a party machine which protects and normalises anti-Semitic ideas and individuals.’</p>
