      <p>The NZD/USD pair tested the 0.6400 mark for the second straight day on Thursday but didn't have a difficult time reversing its direction. As of writing, the pair was trading at its highest level since November 4th at 0.6336, adding 0.28% on a daily basis.</p>
      <h3>NZD continues to react to US-China trade headlines</h3>
      <p>In the absence of significant macroeconomic drivers, developments surrounding the United States (US)-China trade dispute continue to drive the pair's action. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday noted that he was confident about reaching the phase one of the trade deal.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Wall Street Journal reported that China has invited Secretary Treasury Mnuchin and Trade Representative Lighthizer to China with hopes of the next round of face-to-face talks taking place before Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the only data from New Zealand revealed that Credit Card Spending in October increased by 2.5% on a yearly basis and fell short of the market expectation for an increase of 5.5%. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, after the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) October meeting minutes on Wednesday reaffirmed the wait-and-see approach regarding the near-term policy outlook, the greenback remained stuck in its weekly range below the 98 handle. Later in the session, weekly <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Jobless Claims</a> data and Existing Home Sales figures from the United States will be looked upon for fresh impetus.</p>
