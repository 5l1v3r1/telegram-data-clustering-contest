      <h1>New rules on sex and nudity in UK films and TV</h1>
      <h2>Directors have new guidelines for everything from auditions to filming</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:28:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>New guidelines have been issued for directors filming nude and sex scenes in UK film and TV shows.</p>
      <p>The rules have been issued in the wake of the #MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>The rules also cover auditions, where actors can feel pressured to do things they don't want to in order to get work.</p>
      <p>Actors will also have to sign an agreement to being nude or filming sex scenes ahead of shooting.</p>
      <p>Directors UK said it recognised that "by their nature, auditions are based on a power imbalance" and that "some performers can feel obligated to agree to uncomfortable requests to get a job".</p>
      <p>The release of the directing nudity and simulated sex guidelines follows the #MeToo movement, which led to numerous accusations against disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, and the revelation that some in the industry demanded sexual favours for work.</p>
      <p>Directors UK advises a ban on full nudity in any audition or call back and no semi-nudity in first auditions.</p>
      <p>Instead, they suggest performers wear a bikini or trunks and bring a chaperone.</p>
      <p>If a recall requires semi-nudity, the performer and their agent must have 48 hours' notice and the full script.</p>
      <p>The production must also obtain explicit written consent from the performer prior to them being filmed or photographed nude or semi-nude.</p>
      <p>It comes after Emilia Clarke said this week that she felt uncomfortable with some of her nude scenes in Game Of Thrones, and cried before shooting certain scenes.</p>
      <p>The guidelines are supported by industry bodies including Bafta, BFI and the Casting Directors' Guild.</p>
      <p>A statement from Bafta said: "Directors UK were hugely instrumental in shaping the cross-industry bullying and harassment guidance which we published in 2018.</p>
      <p>"They've really embraced the agenda and have created a suite of additional resources which build on the guidance and help their members not only to tackle poor behaviour when they witness it, but also to recognise their role in creating an environment where bullying, harassment and all kinds of coercive behaviour are not tolerated."</p>
      <p>Directors UK campaigns and engagement manager Natasha Moore said: "We created these guidelines to encourage directors to think twice about the environment they create in auditions and on set.</p>
      <p>"Directors can use their influence to nurture a safe working environment for all and this is keenly felt when rehearsing and filming vulnerable and sensitive scenes.</p>
      <p>"The guidelines equip everyone with everything they need to do their job without concern, and it is in this spirit of collaboration that we can all make our best work."</p>
