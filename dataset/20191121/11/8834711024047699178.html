      <p>Minister of Women Maite Nkoana-Mashabane has told the state capture commission that she was taken by surprise when the Guptas landed their private jet at the Waterkloof Air Force Base in 2013.</p>
      <p>The jet was ferrying guests destined for the Gupta wedding in Sun City.</p>
      <p>Nkoana-Mashabane, who was the Minister of International Relations Department at the time, is on the stand at the inquiry on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>At the time, the family claimed it had followed all processes and got full permission from the authorities.</p>
      <p>But the minister said that as the high authority, she knew nothing about the landing.</p>
      <p>“I got to know that an aircraft had landed on television. I immediately called the then DG, who’s the ambassador in New York now.”</p>
