      <p>Royal Portrush Golf Club has said it will discuss the decision of its patron Prince Andrew to step aside from public duties at its next meeting.</p>
      <p>The host of this year's Open Championship said there were no scheduled plans for Andrew to return to the club.</p>
      <p>Charities and organisations associated with the prince have been distancing themselves from him following <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/magazine/entertainment/2019/11/16/news/andrew-says-he-has-no-recollection-of-meeting-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-1767379/">his weekend interview with BBC 2's Newsnight</a>.</p>
      <p>In the hour-long programme, Prince Andrew addressed questions over his relationship with paedophile <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/worldnews/2019/08/12/news/us-investigators-launch-probe-into-the-death-of-financier-jeffrey-epstein-1682395/">Jeffrey Epstein</a> and allegations made by a woman that she was forced to have sex with the royal on three occasions.</p>
      <p>A Royal Portrush statement said: "The allegations surrounding Prince Andrew, and especially the trauma and distress suffered by the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, is a matter of deep regret."</p>
