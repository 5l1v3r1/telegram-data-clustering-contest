      <p>The Duke of York has been seen in public for the first time after his dramatic decision to step down from official royal duties.</p>
      <p>Andrew, who quit his life as a working royal on Wednesday evening over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was pictured leaving Royal Lodge in Berkshire.</p>
      <p>The duke, dressed in a suit and tie, gave a wave as he drove away from his family home in Windsor Great Park.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the Queen’s second son announcing he would step down from public duties for the “foreseeable future”, a US lawyer representing some of Epstein’s alleged victims has raised the possibility of questioning the duke under oath over his relationship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>Discussing how Andrew could become involved in any legal process, Lisa Bloom said that, as an attorney, she had “the right” to seek a statement from individuals she deemed to have “relevant information”.</p>
      <p>The duke is to continue working on his flagship project Pitch@Palace but will do so privately without the support of Buckingham Palace, it emerged.</p>

      <p>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman told the PA news agency on Thursday: “He will continue to work on Pitch but will look at how to do that outside and entirely separate from the palace.”</p>
      <p>It is thought the duke will not have any involvement with the dozens of charities, organisations and military units he is associated with.</p>
      <p>Graham Smith, of Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, called the move “more smoke and mirrors”.</p>
      <p>“Prince Andrew’s decision to step back is more smoke and mirrors to protect the image of the monarchy,” Mr Smith said.</p>

      <p>He added: “Several years ago Andrew was stripped of his trade ambassador title, but then continued to fly around the world representing this country.</p>
      <p>“The palace needs to clarify exactly what they mean by him stepping back and explain why he isn’t stepping down.</p>
      <p>“Otherwise, this just looks like more spin to cover royal backs than real accountability.”</p>
      <p>In his statement, Andrew said he was “willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required”.</p>

      <p>Ms Bloom told BBC Breakfast: “It’s not going to be easy to subpoena someone like Prince Andrew, he’s obviously not walking down the street where a process server can just hand him a piece of paper, it’s a lot more complicated.</p>
      <p>“If he refused to come, we may have a diplomatic situation between (the UK) and (the US). I hope it doesn’t come to that.</p>
      <p>“I take him at his word that he says he is going to co-operate, and I hope that’s what’s going to happen.”</p>
      <p>Pressure had been mounting on the duke in the wake of his so-called ‘car crash’ Newsnight interview, with a growing number of multimillion-pound businesses, universities and charities distancing themselves from him and Pitch@Palace.</p>
      <p>He faced criticism for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein’s victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the financier, who took his own life while in prison earlier this year awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.</p>
      <p>In the interview, the duke denied claims that he slept with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage.</p>
