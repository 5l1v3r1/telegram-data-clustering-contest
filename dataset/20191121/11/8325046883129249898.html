        <li>Lawyers representing the accusers of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken out urging Prince Andrew to offer information to law enforcement in the US about any evidence he may have related to the sex-trafficking claims against his former friend.</li>
        <li>Prince Andrew <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily/status/1197213153852977153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197213153852977153&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fwatch-prince-andrew-interview-about-epstein-connection-bbc-2019-11">on Wednesday announced he would step back</a> from his royal duties following a disastrous interview with the BBC.</li>
        <li>In a statement, the Duke of York said he was “willing to help any appropriate law-enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.”</li>
        <li>Lisa Bloom and Gloria Allred, two lawyers representing some of Epstein’s accusers, urged the Duke of York to come forward voluntarily and offer any relevant information.</li>
        <li>“It’s great that he’s stepping away from his royal duties, but it’s really not about that, it’s about justice and accountability for the victims, so it’s important that he says he’s going to cooperate with law enforcement,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnzlu-Sn4Kk">Bloom said</a>.</li>

      <p>The lawyers of Jeffrey Epstein’s accusers are pressuring Prince Andrew to give evidence to US law enforcement including the FBI after he pledged to help investigate his former friend.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York announced Wednesday that he would be taking a step back from his royal duties for the “foreseeable future” following his disasterous interview with the BBC.</p>
      <p>“I am willing to help any appropriate law-enforcement agency with their investigations, if required,” he said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Lisa Bloom, who represents a group of women alleging sexual abuse and trafficking at the hands of Epstein, said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnzlu-Sn4Kk">in an interview with The Telegraph</a> that while it was “great” that Prince Andrew was stepping down from his royal duties, he should actively cooperate with law enforcement and investigators.</p>
      <p>“It’s great that he’s stepping away from his royal duties, but it’s really not about that – it’s about justice and accountability for the victims, so it’s important that he says he’s going to cooperate with law enforcement,” she said.</p>
      <p>Epstein killed himself in his New York City jail cell in August while facing sex-trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Bloom urged the prince to turn over any evidence he might have on his former friend, including correspondence such as emails, texts, and calendars.</p>
      <p>She also suggested that the prince’s staff, who may have been around when the two met, should also offer any relevant information.</p>
      <p>Gloria Allred, who represents another group of Epstein accusers, said Prince Andrew should contact US authorities “without conditions and without delay,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50498156">according to the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>Asked about what would happen if the prince did not voluntarily offer information, Allred told the BBC that he might be asked to speak under oath in a criminal investigation into possible conspirators of Epstein as well as in individual civil lawsuits made on behalf of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/late-financier-jeffrey-epsteins-estate-faces-lawsuit-from-new-accuser-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Epstein’s accusers</a>.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t made a determination yet as to … whether we will need to take Prince Andrew’s deposition,” Allred told the BBC. “But I’m saying he should provide it in any civil case as well, where his testimony might be relevant.”</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-prince-andrew-interview-about-epstein-connection-bbc-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">“BBC Newsnight” interview</a> on Saturday, Prince Andrew denied that he was close friends with Epstein but said he flew to the US and stayed with the convicted sex offender for four days in 2010 to tell him it was inappropriate for the two to be in contact.</p>
      <p>Bloom said Prince Andrew should answer questions from all the accusers’ attorneys – in particular the attorney of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who alleges she was coerced into having sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Giuffre has offered a detailed account of a March 10, 2001, encounter in which she said she danced with the prince at Tramp nightclub in London before he had sex with her.</p>
      <p>Guiffre publicly released a photograph of her and Prince Andrew in which he has his arm around her waist, which she says was taken at the house of Ghislaine Maxwell, who an ex-girlfriend of Epstein’s who has been accused of acting as his “fixer” at the time.</p>

      <p>In the BBC interview, Prince Andrew said he could not recall meeting Guiffre and suggested that the photograph could be fake.</p>
