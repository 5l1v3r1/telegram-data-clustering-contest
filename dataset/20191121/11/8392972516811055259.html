      <h2>Leanna and Jacob slept together</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:04:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:04</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Rodrigues</a></address>
      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> have predicted Leanna Cavanagh will fall pregnant after sleeping with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a>.</p>
      <p>This week Jacob was shocked to find out paedophile <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-maya-is-released-from-prison/">was being released from prison</a>.</p>
      <p>Fans of the show know school teacher Maya groomed her boyfriend's son Jacob.</p>

      <p>She <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/emmerdale-fans-want-to-throw-up-as-maya-resumes-affair-with-jacob-in-unwatchable-scenes/">made the student believe they were in love</a>, meanwhile she was in a relationship with Jacob's dad, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-david-metcalfe/">David</a>.</p>
      <p>Eventually the truth came out about Maya and she <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-predict-maya-stepney-will-be-back-for-revenge-in-explosive-christmas-storyline/">was sentenced to 12 months in prison</a>, but was released earlier this week after serving five.</p>
      <p>Finding out Maya had been released, Jacob tried to see her but David convinced him not to.</p>
      <p>However, it's clear Jacob isn't giving up on Maya.</p>
      <p>As he left her a voicemail telling her how much he loved her, it was revealed to viewers that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-stunned-as-maya-returns-pregnant/">Maya is pregnant</a>, but <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/six-best-theories-over-what-will-happen-next-in-maya-stepney-plot/">neither Jacob nor David know this</a>.</p>

      <p>In last night's episode of the soap (November 20 2019) Leanna went to see Jacob and tried to help him.</p>
      <aside>Well that's Leanna pregnant now as well as Maya.</aside>
      <p>Leanna, who is also Maya's former stepdaughter, tried to comfort her friend, but one thing led to another and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-pregnancy-fears-for-leanna-as-she-sleeps-with-jacob/">the pair ended up sleeping together</a>.</p>
      <p>Immediately afterwards Jacob made his excuses and left, but he was shocked when Leanna revealed that that had been her first time.</p>

      <p>As she went home, she received a text from Jacob saying "Just checking you're on the pill?"</p>
      <p>This has led viewers to predict the schoolgirl will fall pregnant with Jacob's child.</p>
