      <p>With Orlando Pirates seemingly struggling for goals this season, fans will remember a former Bucs striker Ezenwa Otorogu, who was brought in to score goals, but failed dismally. </p>
      <p>The Nigerian spent time with the Buccaneers for just one season in the 2010/11 campaign.</p>
      <p>He managed to rack up four goals, but that was the end of his purple patch. The 32-year-old did however form part of Pirates’ treble-winning side.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The burly striker was widely regarded as one of the worst strikers in Pirates’ history with question marks surrounding his age and overshadowing his stay in Mzansi.</p>
      <p>He later joined Bloemfontein Celtic on a short-lived deal that yielded no goals. </p>
      <p>Otorogu has been clubless for over a year, having left American side Izee Auto FC in 2018.</p>
