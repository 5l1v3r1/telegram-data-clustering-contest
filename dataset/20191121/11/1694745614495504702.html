      <p>The theme of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Haim">HAIM</a>'s music video for "Hallelujah" can only be described as "an aloof crew of magicians performing magic tricks in gorgeous silk shift dresses," and honestly? I'm here for it.</p>
      <p>The trio — sisters Alana, Danielle, and Este Haim — belt out the somber tune in the video directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which takes place on the stage of a theater in Los Angeles. "Why me, how'd I get this Hallelujah?" the band asks as they float in mid-air and manage to send chairs flying across the stage. "I had a best friend but she has come to pass / One I wish I could see now / You always remind me that memories will last / These arms reach out."</p>
      <p>Watch the poignant video for the new track above, which was co-written with Tobias Jesso Jr., who's also worked with Adele, Sia, and Florence and the Machine. I can't promise it's more delightful than <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/haim-hanson-halloween-costume-46827987">their Hanson cosplay</a>, but if you're a fan of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/haim-now-im-in-it-music-video-46832720">their video for "Now I'm in It,"</a> you'll love it.</p>
