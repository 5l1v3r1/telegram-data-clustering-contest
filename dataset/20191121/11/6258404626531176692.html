      <p>No matter how you slice it, robbing a casino is real life is a bad idea—you may not get your hands lopped off or kneecaps broken like the days of old, but jail time is certainly an inevitable consequence. The same rules don't apply to video games, however, and come December you will be able to stage a daring heist as part of <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/borderlands-3-concurrent-players">Borderland 3's</a> first campaign DLC.<br/><br/>It's called Moxxi's Heist of The Handsome Jackpot. It involves a casino space station that Handsome Jack built before he perished. Moxxi has it in her sights because it was her "dream project" before Jack stole it all for himself, when the two broke up. We have all been there, right?<br/><br/>"This heist is as personal as it gets, and you'll be gambling for your life to help Moxxie get some much-needed closure," Epic Games says.</p>

      <p>Moxxi heads a crew of "eccentric characters" to rob the casino in a series of missions.  There will be "hidden secrets and strange happenings" to discover through side missions and crew challenges, and "never-before-seen enemies and larger-than-life bosses" to go up against.<br/><br/>"The Handsome Jackpot is also home to an army of Hyperion security forces on high alert and crazed casino-goers trapped on board since the station went dark. Even in death, Handsome Jack always finds a way to screw with you," Epic Games says.<br/><br/>There will also be new legendaries, cosmetics, weapon trinkets, emotes, and other stuff crammed in to the DLC. As for Handsome Jack, we suspect he might show up somehow, though that remains to be seen. It's also not clear if the DLC will nudge the level cap.<br/><br/>Moxxi's Heist of The Handsome Jack lands on December 19, 2019. There will be at least three more DLCs to follow.</p>
