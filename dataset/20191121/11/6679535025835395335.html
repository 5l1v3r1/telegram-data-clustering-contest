      <p>PMK leader S. Ramadoss urged India to get Sri Lanka’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to face an enquiry related to war crimes, in the upcoming meeting of the leaders of the two countries.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss expressed shocked over India inviting Gotabaya Rajapaksa on November 29. “It is understandable why India is inviting Rajapaksa, which would be his first foreign visit. The closeness of the Rajapaksa brothers to China would be a possible reason for India’s invite. However, this should not come at the cost of ensuring the welfare of the Tamils,” Dr. Ramadoss said.</p>
      <p>He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to draw the attention of the new Sri Lanka President to ensure punishments for those involved in war crimes, and also to fulfil the promises given to the UN Human Rights Commission, during the scheduled meetings.</p>
      <p>Ramadoss said the Prime Minister should also urge Rajapaksa to ensure political power for Tamils and a withdrawal of troops from North-eastern parts of Sri Lanka and also to return their lands to Tamils.</p>
