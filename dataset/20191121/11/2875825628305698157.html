      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:40:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> camp mates Jacqueline Jossa and Myles Stephenson will reportedly sit down for a chat about what really happened between her husband and his ex.</p>
      <p>Myles dated Love Island star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> for just under a year, calling it quits in August.</p>
      <p>Soap star Jacqueline tied the knot with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> back in 2017 - but in April the year after, he was spotted enjoying a getaway in Marbella with his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> co-star Gabby.</p>
      <p>Both parties denied it, with Jacqueline even bluntly texting Gabby: "Did you sleep with my husband?"</p>
      <p>Now it's thought that Myles and Jacqueline will have a talk in camp - and he'll be willing to spill the beans on what Gabby told him.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10386056/myles-jacqueline-dan-osborne-gabby-allen/">The Sun</a> : "Gabby and Myles discussed the whole Dan situation during their relationship, and even though both Dan and Gabby always denied anything went on between them, there are a lot of things that Jacqueline might not know.</p>

      <p>"Myles would be willing to tell Jacqueline everything - and answer any questions she might have.</p>
      <p>"Now the two camps are all back together, there will be a lot of chats around the fire about everyone's lives. And Myles will tell Jacqueline everything Gabby told him.</p>
      <p>"It's a good thing Gabby's gone to Thailand for a month because she might find it uncomfortable watching."</p>
      <p>Jacqueline and Dan have had some ups and downs in their relationship, with Dan telling new! magazine earlier this year that their marriage was plagued by a "negative energy."</p>

      <p>"I just want to be happy and I want Jac to be happy," the TOWIE hunk said, "Whether that's with me or not.</p>
      <p>"It's more like a really bad tension in the house and it's getting worse. We're losing our friendship. When I feel it's getting too much, I'll get out of the house and go to the gym or something."</p>
      <p>He also struck out when snapped partying with a female pal in LA, writing: "So much bulls**t gets posted and printed about me.</p>

      <p>"Seriously just want them to leave me alone now. It's getting too much, I can't even hang out with friends or even work without them talking s**t about me.</p>
      <p>"Am I being targeted? Cause I swear I don't see others getting it like I do."</p>
      <p>Jacqueline meanwhile has won the affection of I'm A Celeb fans for her no nonsense and down to earth approach to the challenges of life in the jungle.</p>
      <p>She's also been candid about her struggles with weight, with former Queen of the Jungle Scarlett Moffatt gushing: "Jacqueline will easily be in the top three and she'll have a really good chance of being Queen of the Jungle.</p>
      <p>"I've met her a few times and we really hit it off and I think she has real star quality."</p>
