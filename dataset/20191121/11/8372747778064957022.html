      <p>US-born giant panda Bei Bei arrived finally at his new home in Ya'an, in China's Sichuan province, on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The four-year-old arrived in China on Wednesday after a transcontinental flight on a FedEx plane dubbed the “Panda Express”.</p>
      <p>He was then transferred by lorry to the Ya’an Bifengxia Base of the Giant Panda Conservation and Research Center.</p>
      <p>State media said Bei Bei was in good health and had tucked into a breakfast of bamboo upon arrival.</p>
      <p>The panda will be quarantined for one month while he adjusts to his new home.</p>
      <p>State media said he would have to get used to the time difference, local foods and the Sichuanese dialect.</p>
      <p>Bei Bei was conceived through artificial insemination and born to the National Zoo’s Mei Xiang and Tian Tian in 2015.</p>
      <p>His name, which means “treasure” in Chinese, was selected by then-first lady Michelle Obama and China's first lady Peng Liyuan.</p>
      <p>The panda quickly became a favorite with visitors — and on the zoo’s popular Panda Cam.</p>
      <p>Fans bid a bittersweet farewell to the cub online with the hashtag #byebyebeibei.</p>
      <p>Once Bei Bei reaches sexual maturity at age six, he will enter China’s captive breeding program.</p>
      <p>The program is credited with bringing giant pandas back from the brink of extinction.</p>
      <p>They live mainly in Sichuan’s bamboo-covered mountains and are threatened by habitat loss.</p>
