      <p>The dog, who has been named Beans, was found in a cardboard box lined with a blanket near Quarry Street in the Lanarkshire town.</p>
      <p>Rescuers say he would have almost certainly died had it not been for a member of the public finding him.</p>
      <p>And the Scottish SPCA are now making an appeal to the public for information.</p>
      <p>Animal rescue officer Sarah Parker said: “The dog was found in a cardboard box, lined with a blanket, at a local park near to Quarry Street.</p>
      <p>“The young dog, which we believe is a Jack Russell terrier cross, is male and is around eight weeks old.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful to the member of the public who took him in and kept him safe overnight.</p>
      <p>“He is friendly so we suspect he is used to human contact.</p>
      <p>“One of our animal rescue and rehoming centres is providing the care he needs.</p>
      <p>“The team have affectionately named him Beans.</p>
      <p>“The night in question was the coldest so far this year and temperatures were below freezing.</p>
      <p>“Had he not been found, Beans would have almost certainly died so we are keen to find out the circumstances surrounding how he came to be in the park.</p>
      <p>“If anyone has any information, we would urge them to call our confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.”</p>
