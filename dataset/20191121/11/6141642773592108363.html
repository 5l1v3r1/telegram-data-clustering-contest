      <p>Newcastle boss Steve Bruce believes his side’s season could be defined by this calendar year’s remaining fixtures.</p>
      <p>The Magpies play at Bruce’s former club Aston Villa on Monday and host champions Manchester City a week on Saturday before diving into a hectic schedule in December.</p>
      <p>“I said coming into this run of games, after the international break, this next five or six weeks is probably the defining part of the season,” Bruce said.</p>
      <blockquote><b>Newcastle's remaining fixtures in 2019<br/></b>   •  Nov 25 - Aston Villa (a)<br/>   •  Nov 30 - Man City (h)<br/>   •  Dec 5 - Sheff Utd (a)<br/>   •  Dec 8 - Southampton (h)<br/>   •  Dec 14 - Burnley (a)<br/>   •  Dec 21 - Crystal Palace (h)<br/>   •  Dec 26 - Man Utd (a)<br/>   •  Dec 28 - Everton (h)</blockquote>
      <p>“The games come thick and fast. I think we’ve got six or seven games in December, which is ridiculous, so it will define the season and where we’re going to be.”</p>
      <p>Newcastle head to Villa after back-to-back Premier League wins – at West Ham and against Bournemouth – which have taken some of the sting out of the fan criticism Bruce has faced since taking on the job in July.</p>
      <p>“The difference in a couple of weeks and a couple of wins and what it does, especially to a club like ours, is remarkable,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The players are bouncing around the place, training is as lively as it’s ever been and they’re all champing at the bit.</p>

      <p>Ciaran Clark is an injury doubt for Monday after sustaining a knock while on international duty for the Republic of Ireland, while fellow defender and skipper Jamaal Lascelles is sidelined due to a fractured tibia.</p>
      <p>But Bruce confirmed two other defenders, Florian Lejeune and Fabian Schar, could make a timely return to action at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Frenchman Lejeune has yet to appear this season after rupturing an anterior cruciate knee ligament in April, while Switzerland centre-back Schar has been out with a knee problem since mid-October.</p>

      <p>Winger Matt Ritchie remains sidelined after his recent setback when returning to training following ankle ligament damage.</p>
      <p>Bruce confirmed Ritchie consulted a specialist on Wednesday for a second opinion after having minor surgery last month.</p>
