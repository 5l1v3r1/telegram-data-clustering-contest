      <p>Ben Foden has revealed his ex-wife Una Healy ‘thinks he’s doing great’ on The X Factor: Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The rugby player, who split from the Irish singer last year after six years of marriage, said Una has been supporting him on the show.</p>
      <p>Ben is a part of rugby player supergroup Try Star, alongside Thom Evans and Levi Davis.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the MailOnline, Ben said: “Una always used to encourage me to do the music thing. When I told her that I was doing [The X Factor] she thought it was a great idea. She loves it.”</p>

      <p>He explained: “Una and I have a good relationship for the sake of the kids. I always wish her the very, very best. And the kids [Aoife, 7, and Tadgh, 4] are loving The X Factor.”</p>
      <p>‘They went to the show last week. They’re coming this weekend. They’re going to go absolutely bananas.”</p>
      <p>“Their mum is obviously mega talented at singing. She always says when she catches [the show]. Sometimes she’s busy, but she thinks [Try Star] are doing great,” he said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Una has moved on with former Limerick hurler David Breen.</p>
