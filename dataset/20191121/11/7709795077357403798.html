        <b>Kyle Edmund more than justified his Davis Cup place with a superb performance to beat Mikhail Kukushkin 6-3 6-3.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Edmund was called up to replace Andy Murray on Thursday, with the latter admitting he was not in peak physical condition following a three-set battle less than 24 hours earlier.</p>
      <p>Kukushkin is ranked two places higher than Edmund, who has had a poor season and only clinched his spot in the Davis Cup team at the last minute by virtue of a decent run at the Paris Masters.</p>
      <p>But here he struck his big groundstrokes with authority, pounced on any short balls and hung tough under pressure, saving all the break points he faced.</p>

      <p>Edmund's victory was met with delight by the sizeable contingent of travelling fans and silenced the enthusiastic Kazakh band, which made such an impression at April's Fed Cup tie between the two countries in London.</p>
      <p>The Yorkshireman said: "Today I just wanted to go on court and really give it my all. It was such a buzz to thrive off this crowd. Davis Cup, playing for your country - it doesn't get any better."</p>
      <p>Victory for Evans over Alexander Bublik in the second rubber will send Britain through to a quarter-final against Germany on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>Edmund added: "The job's half done so we really need to push it home now."</p>
