      <h1>Buyers confused as chopsticks go up for sale at £25 each advertised as Harry Potter wands</h1>
      <h2>They created some hilarious reactions on a Devon 'Buy Swap Sell' page</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:32:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author">Colleen Smith</a></address>
      <p>Buyers were scratching their heads when two 'incredible Harry Potter wands!' were put up for sale on a Devon 'Buy Swap Sell' site last night - because they looked just like the kind of chopsticks handed out free at Asian restaurants.</p>
      <p>Seller Freddy Quinne posted on the closed Buy Swap Sell in Teignbridge, Torquay and South Hams Facebook page saying: "For Sale! Two incredible Harry Potter wands! Give a young child a magical Christmas with this superb present, guaranteed to put a smile on their faces. £25 each."</p>
      <p>But the picture showed two completely plain dark wood sticks. The first to call Freddy out was Chris Manley who admitted: "A lot of people think it's real - I did at first."</p>
      <p>In a hilarious back and forth Chris sent three laughing face emojis and asked: "Aren't these just chopsticks?"</p>
      <p>Freddy replied: "Absolutely not, I'm actually quite offended you'd even ask. I got these from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. They are 100 per cent authentic."</p>

      <p>Chris then asked for some proof or a box to prove they are real and Freddie replied: "It's a wand Chris, not a Rolex."</p>
      <p>Chris stuck to his guns saying: "It's chopsticks mate. Not wands," with the crying tears of laughter emoji.</p>
      <p>Freddy kept his answer deadpan saying: "No Chris, they are wands. They might look like chopsticks because I have two of them and they're next to each other, but if there was just one we wouldn't even be having this discussion."</p>

      <p>Chris found out for certain that his replies were part of a joke once he clicked through to Freddy's page and found out he is a comedian.</p>
      <p>Freddy copied the whole conversation between him and Chris, saying simply "Rumbled."</p>

      <p>DevonLive spoke to the Lancashire comedian, who has toured in Devon, and his immediate response was several minutes of deep laughter.</p>
      <p>At first he said: "These are top quality wands! I'm not going to comment on sales at this stage but there has been an awful lot of interest in the wands all over the country. Stocks are running low."</p>

      <p>When asked how many he had sold he said: "Well, I had two to start with - and now we're down to the last couple."</p>
      <p>Then he admitted: "I just like to create a bit of Christmas magic so I stuck them on a couple of 'Buy Swap Sell' sites around the country. It's funny because people are so enthusiastic to point out a scam and it's a good way to create content for my Facebook page."</p>
