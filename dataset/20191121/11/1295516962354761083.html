      <h1>Arrow: The Monitor Rewrites Oliver's History in 'Reset' Promo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:11:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Stone</a></address>
      <p>Realties and timelines converge in a new promo for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/arrow/"><i>Arrow</i></a>'s final season as Oliver Queen finds himself in an altered version of his past.</p>
      <p>The episode title "Reset" appears to be quite literal based on the footage, which sees Oliver awaken to an incarnation of Star City where his longtime friend and deputy mayor Quentin Lance is still alive and well. With Oliver visibly conflicted by his fragmented memories, his time-displaced daughter Mia Smoak also appears in the altered timeline.</p>

      <p>Season 8 has seen Oliver act as a reluctant ally to The Monitor, preparing to save the Arrowverse from the coming "Crisis." He would go on to lead Team Arrow in a rebellion against the omnipotent being when their priorities and methodologies clashed, resulting in the team being betrayed and incapacitated.</p>
      <p>Quentin Lance was killed by Ricardo Diaz at the end of <i>Arrow</i>'s sixth season. Following Oliver's attempted double-cross, his return is a cruel reminder to Oliver of the life he lost.</p>
