      <p>The High Court in Edinburgh heard that the premises were rented from the local authority by another man who was told by McCaig that he wanted to use it to store motorbikes.</p>
      <p>A judge told McCaig, 23, that a significant amount of drugs were involved and pointed out that the firearms offence carried a minimum term of five years imprisonment.</p>
      <p>Lord Brailsford said: "You have obviously been keeping some bad company. That is obvious from the terms of the social work report and you are now paying the penalty for that."</p>
      <p>But the judge pointed out that McCaig still had the chance to turn his life around.</p>
      <p>He jailed McCaig for five years for the firearms crime and three years for the drugs offence, but ordered that the sentences run concurrently.</p>
      <p>McCaig had denied the illegal possession of the revolver and being concerned in the supply of the Class A drug on May 22 last year at an earlier trial but was convicted of the offences.</p>
      <p>Defence counsel Matt Jackson QC said: "He maintains his innocence." McCaig had claimed that someone bore a grudge against him and he was set up.</p>
      <p>Lord Brailsford told McCaig: "You have been found guilty by a jury and that is a factor that must be faced up to."</p>
      <p>Police found the gun and drugs, which had a potential to make £33,000 on the streets, along with a machete and knives during a search of the premises at a garage site at Berrywell Road.</p>
      <p>The court heard that DNA and fingerprint evidence helped link McCaig to the crime.</p>
      <p>A small amount of cannabis of a personal use quantity was also discovered at his address in Lossie Place, in Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>Mr Jackson said McCaig has abused cocaine in the past and had an issue with drink.</p>
      <p>He said he was now at a crossroads and added: "This is an opportunity for him to address his alcohol problem, certainly to address his drug problem."</p>
      <p>The defence counsel said that McCaig suffered from anxiety and depression and was diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager.</p>
