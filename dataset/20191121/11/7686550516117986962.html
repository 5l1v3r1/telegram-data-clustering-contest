      <p>Carpet Castle in Caerphilly have become one of the region’s biggest success stories selling brand name carpets at bargain-basement prices.</p>
      <p>As this family business continues to grow, we caught up with director Andrew Graham to talk about the secrets of its success.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. How are you able to sell the same carpets as the big national chains at these incredible prices?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. People in South Wales love a bargain, and by keeping our costs low and being really selective with our buying, we’re able to beat the competition virtually every time. We buy only in full truck loads, direct from the best manufacturers across the UK and Europe and we have a very large storage facility in Caerphilly, so when we find a bargain we can buy massive quantities.</p>
      <p>When we do a deal it’s quite common that we’ll clear out an entire factory. Just last week a manufacturer contacted us about an oversupply issue, so we took 400 room-size pieces off their hands and these were top brands - the sort of stuff that would fetch £30 a square metre normally, and we’ll be selling them at about £10 a square metre.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. How have you expanded the business?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. Honestly, when you get the prices and the service levels right the customers just seem to find you. Word of mouth is the best form of advertising. Like I said, we don’t like to waste money on anything and that includes expensive advertising campaigns!</p>

        <b>Q. How have things changed in the industry over the last few years?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. We’ve noticed that our customers have responded really well to the improvements we’ve made to our service levels. We have an amazing team in-store, a really lovely group and they go out of their way to help people.</p>
      <p>We deliver within 24 hours, measure up free of charge and even dispose of the customers’ old carpets. The team will always do their best to help every customer save money. We’ve also worked really hard to ensure 100 per cent stock availability on all our best-sellers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. How has the internet impacted the business?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. The transaction side of things hasn’t been affected at all, but the visibility stuff has, so we’ve built up our online presence in terms of SEO and PPC. However, the biggest factor has been the online customer reviews.</p>
      <p>Many of our customers leave reviews on Facebook, Google, Trustpilot and other portals and we’re really lucky to have received hundreds of five star ratings and lovely reviews. These days it’s really important to engage with social media and I think the transparency is appreciated by potential customers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. The business is entering its 50th year, how did it begin?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. It actually began as a DIY discount centre in the 1970s. My Dad started it with his own savings and an incredible work ethic. He really built it up from nothing.</p>
      <p>Today it has obviously grown into something a lot bigger but the central ethos of incredible value for money and down-to-earth service is just as present now as it was when he began all those years ago. We actually still have customers who remember it opening. They have trusted us for almost half a century and that’s something we’re really proud of.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. What do you think the future holds for Carpet Castle?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. Hopefully we’ll keep growing. Every year we take on more staff, expand our product ranges and look for new growth areas like our amazing artificial grass business. We will always look at new ways that we can disrupt the marketplace and offer better value for money for the customer.</p>
