      <p>TUNIS (Reuters) - Algeria is targeting a sharp reduction to its wheat imports as it tries to rein in its costly subsidized bread programme in the face of popular protests against the ruling elite.</p>
      <p>The North African country has decided to cap soft wheat imports at 4 million tonnes a year, down from 6.2 million tonnes, the government said in a statement late on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The move is designed to “preserve foreign currency and reduce Algerian imports of cereals, especially soft wheat”, it said.</p>
      <p>The import ceiling reflected a government estimate of the actual needs of the domestic market for soft wheat at 4 million tonnes.</p>
      <p>The change will take effect immediately, a government source said.</p>
      <p>Algeria is among the world’s biggest wheat buyers, sourcing most of its supply from France. It spent about $3 billion on wheat imports last year, including durum wheat, flour and semolina.</p>
      <p>However, hit by lower oil prices since 2014, it is trying to reduce its imports.</p>
      <p>Mass protests this year, which led to the departure of longstanding President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, have also pushed the interim government to target corruption.</p>
      <p>Grain traders said the import ceiling is in keeping with other moves this year.</p>
      <p>In July the government removed the head of state grains agency OAIC after a corruption investigation and has also closed some of the country’s 500 flour mills.</p>
      <p>After the closure of 45 mills, more than 300 others are under investigation, an agriculture ministry source said.</p>
      <p>OAIC also refrained from any wheat imports in October, breaking with its usual practice of holding tenders every calendar month.</p>
      <p>“They are showing they want to curb abuse and mismanagement,” one European trader said.</p>
      <p>However, traders remained sceptical about Algeria’s ability to reduce wheat imports so steeply, given low domestic production and the importance of its subsidized bread programme.</p>
      <p>OAIC held an import tender for soft wheat on Wednesday, with traders reporting that the agency bought about 500,000 tonnes at $223-$224 a tonne including freight.</p>
