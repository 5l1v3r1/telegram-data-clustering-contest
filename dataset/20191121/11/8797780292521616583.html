      <p>You look at any racing game on the market today, and you see a collection of automobile history that stretches through the ages. After all, no contemporary racing title would be complete without a showcase of American muscle, European tuning and Japanese drifting. From Ford to Nissan, Lotus to Mitsubishi, fans expect certain brands to be present in their racing game franchise of choice.</p>
      <p>Which is why its bloody odd that Toyota has been absent for a couple of years now from the digital scene. Having folded their arms and given a thorough <i>nuh-uh </i>to the idea of licensing their cars to appear in video games, Toyota’s absence has been sorely felt amidst the many <i>many </i>racing titles that have popped up since their exodus in 2017.</p>
      <p>No one knows why Toyota bailed on the scene in the first place, <a href="https://drivetribe.com/p/will-toyota-come-back-to-racing-GUum27oySG-QynuSKFYVkA?iid=dhRBzAxpQ3-GogRwGO1Ixw">although DriveTribe theorised</a> that it had something to do with the company’s higher-ups believing that their actual car sales were being hammered by people who felt that the digital equivalent was better than the real thing. No, for reals. Other than a quick appearance in Gran Turismo Sport, Toyota has spent a couple of years out of the gaming spotlight, robbing fans of many a classic car to tear up a track with.</p>
      <p>That all changes on December 12, as Forza Horizon 4 will see one of Toyota’s finest mechanical hours dropped into that homage to car culture:</p>

      <p>It’s just a single car, but it’s hopefully also a signal that Toyota is ready to start making a proper comeback to a genre that has sorely missed it. At this rate, I’d be absolutely delighted if Need for Speed Heat could add a Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE86 with those signature Initial D panda stripes that would please the anime nerd inside me greatly. That, and I’ve got a dream list of other cars from the big T that I’d love to see. Give me a game that features the aforementioned AE86, 1988’s Toyota Soarer Turbo and the legendary GT-One and I’ll be able to die a very happy man.</p>
