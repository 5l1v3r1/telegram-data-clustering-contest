      <p>General Motors is recalling more than 640,000 pickup trucks because the seat belts can set the carpeting on the floor of the vehicles on fire.</p>
      <p>A small explosion is used to move a piston that tightens the high-tech seat belts before a crash, <a href="https://apnews.com/4cc91c3388e345e1a4fe2bb391dfb0d1">the Associated Press reports.</a> The explosion can potentially release hot gas through an opening in the pretensioner brackets, possibly setting the carpet on the floor of the vehicle on fire.</p>
      <p>There have been reports of two fires but no injuries.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2019/gm-seat-belt-pretensioner-fires-truck-recall.shtml">carcomplaints.com,</a> the following pickup trucks are included in the recall:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2019-2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500</li>
        <li>2019-2020 GMC Sierra 1500</li>
        <li>2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500</li>
        <li>2020 Chevrolet Silverado 3500</li>
        <li>2020 GMC Sierra 2500</li>
        <li>2020 GMC Sierra 3500</li>
      </ul>
      <p>GM hasn't said when the recall will begin, but dealerships will close the opening though which hot gas can be released at no cost to the truck owner.</p>
      <p>Truck owners may call Chevy at 1-800-222-1020 or GMC at 1-888-988-7267 and ask about recall number 192270600 if they have any additional questions.</p>
