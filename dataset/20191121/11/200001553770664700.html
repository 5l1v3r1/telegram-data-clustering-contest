      <h1>Club want to sign Liverpool player… but pay fee over four year period</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/besiktas-transfer-haberi-4-taksitle-loris-karius-haber-fotograf-2103270-2">Turkish newspaper Fanatik</a> report the head of Besiktas’ transfer committee Erdal Torunogullari will hold talks with the club’s manager Abdullah Avci about the future of Liverpool loanee Loris Karius.</p>
      <p>The German goalkeeper has been in impressive form for Besiktas in recent weeks and this has led to reports the Black Eagles now want to sign him permanently at the end of his loan spell.</p>
      <p>Fanatik claim Besiktas have the option to make his move permanent for €8m next summer, but the Super Lig side want to pay that figure over four years.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed Besiktas have the financial resources to pay Liverpool €2m each year and if they can get an agreement with the Premier League side then they could complete the deal in January.</p>
      <p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has Alisson and Adrian as his current goalkeepers, so finding room for Karius could be challenging if he returns next summer.</p>
      <p>Karius’ contract with the Merseyside club will run until June 2021.</p>
