      <p>I’m a Celebrity’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a> is set to tell <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> what happened between his ex, Gabby Allen and her husband, Dan Osborne, new reports claim.</p>
      <p>Dan and Jacqueline have been married since 2017 but briefly split in April 2018 after Dan was seen on holiday with former Love Islander Gabby.</p>
      <p>Gabby and Rak-Su singer Myles started <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> that September, and were in a relationship for 11 months before splitting amid claims Myles cheated on her.</p>
      <p>Dan and Gabby have always denied that anything happened between them, stating that they were just friends and were with a collective of mates during the holiday.</p>
      <p>But The Sun is now claiming that that Myles will tell Jacqueline ‘everything’ she wants to know during those long days bored by the camp fire.</p>

      <p>‘Myles would be willing to tell Jacqueline everything – and answer any questions she might have,’ a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10386056/myles-jacqueline-dan-osborne-gabby-allen/">source told the paper</a>.</p>

      <p>‘Myles will tell Jacqueline everything Gabby told him. It’s a good thing Gabby’s gone to Thailand for a month because she might find it uncomfortable watching.’</p>

        <i>Representatives for Dan declined to comment further.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Jacqueline and Dan have two children together – four-year-old Ella and Mia, 15 months – with Dan also having a son from a former relationship, Teddy.</p>
      <p>While in the jungle, Dan has been hosting Instagram lives to watch his wife take on challenges, which have included being covered in spiders as she’s submerged in an orb.</p>
