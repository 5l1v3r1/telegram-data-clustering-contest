      <h1>NFL mock draft 2020: Tua Tagovailoa drops out of first round after injury; Dolphins take Justin Herbert, instead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:55:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Vinnie Iyer</a></address>
      <p>The NFL future of Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa took an unfortunate hit when he went down hard against Mississippi State on Saturday and suffered <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/tua-tagovailoa-injury-update-full-recovery-alabama/180j74l0ucrnf15c15n6plvm81">a major hip injury</a>. That prompts the biggest change in mock drafts everywhere, as Tua's availability for 2020 and beyond is now a big question mark.</p>
      <p>Also of note: The Giants lost to the Jets in Week 10 and the Jets won again in Week 11 while the Giants had a bye.That meansNew York's NFC team for will have a higher pick in the 2020 NFL Draft than New York's AFC team.</p>
      <p>Both teams are in pursuit of similar types of players once again. Quarterback is out of the way for both thanks to Daniel Jones and Sam Darnold, but the crosstown rivals coulduse some pass-rushing and pass-catching help.</p>

      <p>
        <b>1. Cincinnati Bengals (0-10)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Joe Burrow, QB, LSU</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Burrow has enjoyed a meteoric rise as the new Heisman Trophy favorite andappealing top QB prospect in this class, and his big performance in the win over Alabama stamped that status. At 6-3, 215 pounds, he combines his mental and physical toughness in the pocket with a strong arm and accurate delivery. His leadership skills also have flourished in Baton Rouge.Coach Zac Taylor will see some Jared Goff qualities in Burrowas a traditional passer, but Burrow is better than that with his athleticism. He, and not Ryan Finley, should be the long-term replacement forAndy Dalton.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Washington Redskins (1-9)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Andrew Thomas, OT, Georgia</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Assuming the Redskins want to stick with and develop first-round QB Dwayne Haskinswith a new coach and will part ways with Trent Williams, they need a new rock of a left tackle.Thomas matches great size (6-5, 320 pounds) with good hands and footwork, so he can also be an asset in the running game for Derrius Guice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. New York Giants (2-8)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chase Young, EDGE, Ohio State</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Giants have loved themselves some transcendent pass-rushers over the years, and Dave Gettleman will jump at the chance to get this cornerstone talent for the team's defensive rebuild. Young (6-5, 265 pounds) is a game-changing disruptor. He has followeda 10.5-sack season with 13.5already in eightgames as a junior.</p>

        <figcaption>Justin Herbert</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>4. Miami Dolphins (2-8)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Justin Herbert, QB, Oregon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With no healthy Tagovailoa, this has to be the choice for the Dolphins. Herbert (6-6, 237 pounds)is an athletic, accurate playmaker who can continue to close the gap between himself and Burrow after making the wise decision to return to school — matching the mostly good decisions he makes on the field. After a slow start to the Ducks' season, he has revved up his performance to restore his first-round status.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. New York Jets (3-7)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jerry Jeudy, WR, Alabama</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Jets need an all-around perimeter guy for Sam Darnold, asspeedy deep threat Robby Anderson won't be re-signed. Jeudy is a classic, drive-finishing No. 1 at 6-1, 198 pounds. He alsowon't be theonly 'Bama wideout taken in the first round.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-7)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jeff Okudah, CB, Ohio State</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Okudah has emerged as a premier ballhawk for the Buckeyes with his threeinterceptions in ninegames, and he keeps getting better as a shutdown type at 6-1, 200 pounds. The Buccaneers have been awful on the back end with Vernon Hargreaves disappointing to the point of releaseand Carlton Davis and M.J. Stewartbeing liabilities.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>CeeDee Lamb</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>7. Denver Broncos (3-7)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CeeDee Lamb, WR, Okahoma</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Broncos, wherever they go at quarterback in 2019, need another big playmaker outside to complement Courtland Sutton. Lamb has needed only 44receptions in 10games to put up 983 yards and 13TDs. At 6-3, 190 pounds, he is both a great vertical threat and a red-zone target.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Atlanta Falcons (3-7)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A.J. Epenesa, EDGE, Iowa</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Falcons mightnot have defensive-mindedcoach Dan Quinn around to help make this pick, but a long, lean 4-3 end who can disruptin the backfield would be nice for the Falcons. Epenesa (6-6, 280 pounds) is a powerful, explosive, big-bodied player with some traits similar to those of Joey Bosa.</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. Arizona Cardinals (3-7-1)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grant Delpit, S, LSU</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Cardinals, who can't covertight ends, need someone who can fly around the field and stopthe run like an extra linebacker andmake big plays whileinside in coverage. Delpit plays like the Chargers' Derwin James with tremendous size(6-3, 203 pounds) for the position.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10. Detroit Lions (3-6-1)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Javon Kinlaw, DT, South Carolina</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Lions invested in Trey Flowers at defensive end, but they've struggled against the run this season. For help in that area as well as getting inside pressure on the QB, Kinlaw makes a lot of sense. Damon Harrison is 30, and both Mike Daniels and A'Shawn Robinson are pending free agents.Kinlawhas been a big-time inside disruptor for the Gamecocks with 5.5 sacks in 10 games. At 6-6, 310 pounds, he would be a great fit for Matt Patricia.</p>
      <p>
        <b>11. Los Angeles Chargers (4-7)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calvin Throckmorton, OT, Oregon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Throckmorton (6-5, 309 pounds) is putting together a fine senior season for the Ducks while blocking for Herbert. He is asmooth,agile pass protectorwith the upside to develop into a better run blocker in the NFL. Phiiip Rivers could really use him with current tackles Russell Okung and Sam Tevi hurting.</p>
      <p>
        <b>12. Jacksonville Jaguars (4-6)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yetur Gross-Matos, EDGE, Penn State</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Yannick Ngakoue is a pending free agent who might be out of their price range, and Calais Campbell is 33. The Jaguars will need to re-supplytheir pass rush, and Gross-Matos (6-5, 242 pounds) is a well-built, explosive and versatile defender who can thrive in Todd Wash's 4-3 scheme.</p>
      <p>
        <b>13. Cleveland Browns (4-6)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tristan Wirfs, OT, Iowa</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Securing the edges of their offensive line, especially in pass protection, is the Browns' top priority. At6-5, 315 pounds, Wirfs is theall-around stout tackle the Browns desperately need to fortify their front for the sake of bothBaker Mayfield and Nick Chubb.</p>

        <figcaption>Henry Ruggs III</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>14. Las Vegas Raiders (from Bears)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Henry Ruggs III, WR, Alabama</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Raiders have made it work with Tyrell Williams as their default No. 1 after the Antonio Brown trade didn't work out, but they could use a true complete receiver to line up outside for Derek Carr.Ruggs (6-0, 190 pounds) plays bigger than his size as a dynamic deep threat with underrated qualities as a possession man.</p>
      <p>
        <b>15. Philadelphia Eagles (5-4)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kristian Fulton, CB, LSU</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Everyone can see the Eagles’ desperate need for a lockdown corner who has a nose for big plays, given how messy that position has been or them in 2019. Fulton (6-1, 192 pounds)is a physical cover man with great technique and footwork, giving him shutdown upside.</p>
      <p>
        <b>16. Miami Dolphins (from Steelers)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Laviska Shenault Jr., WR, Colorado</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Dolphins will look for someone to pair with Herbert as his fellow rookie go-to guy, and with Jeudy, Lamb and Ruggs off the board, they still will have plenty of top-flight options. Shenault is acomplete receiver at 6-1, 215 pounds. He has 45 catches for 621 yards and 3 TDs in 10 games for the Buffaloes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>17. Tennessee Titans (5-5)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jalen Hurts, QB, Oklahoma</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Marcus Mariota and Ryan Tannehill areunsigned for 2020. This is a copycat league in whichQBs from Oklahoma's great passing system were thepast two No. 1 picks. The NFL is more open to dual threats of his ilk, and Hurts, at 6-2, 219 pounds, has good enough size with a welcome winning pedigree. The latest buzz on him can't be denied, and it doesn't hurt that Kyler Murray is looking great with Arizona.</p>
      <p>
        <b>18. Carolina Panthers (5-5)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Derrick Brown, DT, Auburn</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Panthers, after addressing the edge with Brian Burns and Christian Miller, need to beef up their front with a quick disruptor who makes plays in the backfield. Brown (6-5, 318 pounds) fits that mold.</p>
      <p>
        <b>19. Las Vegas Raiders (6-4)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Isaiah Simmons, OLB, Clemson</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Raiders areweak on the second level, both against the run sometimes andin intermediate coverage mosttimes. Simmons (6-4, 240 pounds)is an active player who seems to be all over the field for the Tigers. He's a perfect fit for the strong side of Paul Guenther's defense.</p>
      <p>
        <b>20. Jacksonville Jaguars (from Rams)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trevon Diggs, CB, Alabama</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Jaguars can replace Jalen Ramseywith Diggs,who can pair well with A.J. Bouye because of his size (6-2, 207pounds), strength and downfield speed. Diggs is rising fastwith his big senior season (threeinterceptions in eightgames).</p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>D'Andre Swift, RB, Georgia</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Dolphins can complete their offensive skill rebuild by adding a feature back. They need more of a power runner with a dash of explosiveness and some receiving upside. Swift (5-9, 229 pounds) is capable of both gettingthe tough yards inside and breaking free for big plays in the open field.</p>
      <p>
        <b>22. Minnesota Vikings (8-3)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tyler Biadasz, C/G, Wisconsin</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Vikings need to keep upgrading their power run blocking to fit their new offensive identity with Dalvin Cook, and Biadasz (6-3, 321 pounds) is next in thestrong lineof Badgersblockers (Travis Frederick, Kevin Zeitler).</p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chase Claypool, WR, Notre Dame</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Bills need a big outside No. 1 to complement the speed of diminutive dasher John Brown and the welcome slot work of another veteran newcomer, Cole Beasley. Claypool has lived up to his first-round talent with dominant performances in recent weeks. He has a little Mike Evans-upside in him at 6-4, 229 pounds. He has 49 receptions for 768 yards and 9 TDs in 10 games as a senior.</p>
      <p>
        <b>24. Seattle Seahawks (8-2)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>C.J. Henderson, CB, Florida</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Seahawks, two years removed from losing Richard Sherman, still need to get better at cornerback. Henderson (6-1, 202 pounds) plays bigger than he is with great athleticism and technique in his favor. He just needs to get a little more physical to be trusted against receivers who rely on body positioning to get open.</p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jonathan Taylor, RB, Wisconsin</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Marlon Mack is a good power back, but he has some durability issues and has lost some effectiveness behind the Colts' elite line and can't be a three-down option. Taylor (5-11, 219 pounds) has great vision and burst as a runner, and he doesn't get enough credit for what he can do as a receiver, which has been on display more this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>26. Dallas Cowboys (6-4)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neville Gallimore, DT, Oklahoma</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Gallimore (6-2, 301 pounds) is gettingmore attention for the punch he has shown on the Sooners'interior line this season, blossoming as a senior with three sacks. The Cowboys could use someone like him to further set the tone up front and get to the quarterback to complement what they have on the edge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>27. Kansas City Chiefs (7-4)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kenneth Murray, ILB, Oklahoma</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Chiefs have been trying to get by with a rotation in the middle, and the results have been awful, as they can neither stop the run nor cover backs or tight ends.Murray (6-2, 243 pounds) is an active, rangy playmaker who can be as effective dropping back as he is getting downhill against the run or blitzing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>28. New Orleans Saints (8-2)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jalen Reagor, WR, TCU</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Saints need adasher to complement Michael Thomas and stretch the field. Reagor fits the bill at 5-11, 185 pounds and also provides some nice run-after-catch skills.</p>
      <p>
        <b>29. Baltimore Ravens (8-2)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Justin Jefferson, WR, LSU</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Jefferson is getting plenty of first-round hype after looking great against Alabama (7 catches, 79 yards) to build on a great overall solid season (62 catches, 898 yards, 9 TDs). He can be an excellent intermediate complement to Marquise Brown for Lamar Jackson, adding to last year's draft haul of Brown and Miles Boykin. Jefferson is tough and quick enoughat 6-3, 192 pounds to be effective as a big slot.</p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tee Higgins, WR, Clemson</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Higgins combines tremendous, No. 1-style size (6-4, 205 pounds) with explosiveness. He is averaging 20.4 yards per catch with 5 TDs for the Tigers in 2019. The Packers need to clean up the committee behind Davante Adams.</p>
      <p>
        <b>31. San Francisco 49ers (9-1)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creed Humphrey, G, Oklahoma</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Humphrey (6-4, 312 pounds) is a good hand fighter who hasgreat athleticism for the position to fit nicely inKyle Shanahan's zone blocking scheme. The 49ers need line help in some form, and they target a right guard upgrade over Mike Person here.</p>
      <p>
        <b>32. New England Patriots (9-1)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Raekwon Davis, DT, Alabama</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Davis (6-7, 312 pounds) is a massive, versatile player from a scheme and program Bill Belichick likes. He can line up at both end and tackle to eat space against the run. Also look for them to be interested in stashing an injured Tagovailoa behind Tom Brady later in the draft.</p>
