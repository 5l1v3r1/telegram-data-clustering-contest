      <p>Six bank employee unions have said they will stage a dharna in front of Parliament on December 10 against the proposed merger of several public sector banks, to stop 'anti-people’ banking reforms, to ensure the recovery of bad loans and several other issues.</p>
      <p>The unions are the All India Bank Employees Association, the All India Bank Officers' Confederation, the All India Bank Officers Association, the Bank Employees Federation of India, the Indian National Bank Employees' Federation and the Indian National Bank Officers' Congress.</p>
      <p>“Experience of mergers in the country and across the globe has clearly shown that no benefit accrues to any of the stakeholder,” the unions said in a joint statement. “On the other hand, in the name of rationalisation of branches, a large number of branches would be closed affecting the common man. Millions would be affected as employment - both direct and indirect - would take a hit.”</p>
