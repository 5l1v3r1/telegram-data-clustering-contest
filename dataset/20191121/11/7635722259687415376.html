        <b>Billy McKinlay has been appointed as Stoke City's new assistant manager.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 50-year-old was Michael O'Neill's number two with Northern Ireland between 2012 and 2014.</p>
      <p>McKinlay left that role to take charge of Watford but he was only in the job for eight days when the Hornets decided to replace him with Slavisa Jokanovic</p>
      <p>O'Neill and McKinlay player together with Dundee United in the 1990s.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.stokecityfc.com/news/2019/november/Billy-checks-in/">O’Neill said</a>: "Billy and I have known each other since the early 90's when we were teammates and I’m delighted to welcome him to the staff at Stoke City.</p>
      <p>"I’ve seen Billy work at both club and international level and I know that he’s an excellent coach who I believe is a great fit for us."</p>
      <p>McKinlay landed his first coaching job with Fulham in 2005, eventually working his way up to the role of first-team coach under Martin Jol.</p>
      <p>The former Scotland international also spent time in Spain where he served as first-team coach under David Moyes at Real Sociedad.</p>
      <p>He then took charge of Norwegian top-flight team Stabaek for seven months before linking-up again with Moyes again at Sunderland.</p>
      <p>McKinlay was also one of Moyes' assistants at West Ham in 2017 alongside Alan Irvine, Stuart Pearce and Chris Woods.</p>
      <p>Stoke are currently second from bottom in the Championship and face Wigan this weekend.</p>
