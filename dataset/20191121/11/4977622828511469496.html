      <p>An event in Malaysia in which Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) General Secretary, K Veeramani, was to take part on 24 November (Sunday) has been called off following objections from Malaysian Hindu non-governmental organisations.</p>
      <p>Veeramani was scheduled to visit Malaysia in connection with the screening of a Tamil movie of the DK founder, “Periyar” E V Ramasamy (EVR).</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://twitter.com/rvaidya2000/status/1197075593067552768">invitation </a>in connection with the screening of the movie said that Veeramani would speak on “Periyar Ramasamy’s visit to Malaysia and its Impact” before the screening of the movie “Periyar”.</p>
      <p>The programme was organised by the India-Malaysia Heritage Group and the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Indian Cultural Centre, which is part of the Indian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>Among various organisations, the Malaysia Hindhudharma Maamandram (Malaysia Hindu Dharma Forum) too <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcRMDJQBSG8&amp;feature=youtu.be">appealed </a>to the Malaysian Home Minister to ban Veeramani from visiting Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Condemning the proposed visit by the Dravidian Kazhagam leader, the forum said the Malaysian government should ensure that Veeramani did not influence religious traditions and practices of the multi-racial and multi-cultural country.</p>
      <p>In particular, the forum pointed to a video clip of his interview in which he called those worshipping Gods -- of all religions -- “fools”.</p>
      <p>The Malaysia Hindhudharma Maamandram said it believed in “<i>Rukunegara kepercayaan kepada tuhan</i>”, which, in Malay language means: Believe in God and in achieving a more perfect unity amongst the whole society.</p>
      <p>In India, the social media saw outbursts against the Indian High Commission’s cultural centre being involved in the event in which a person who loses no opportunity to bash Hindu Gods and Hindus was invited.</p>
      <p>Rajiv Malhotra of Infinity Foundation <a href="https://twitter.com/RajivMessage/status/1197084993060622338">tweeted </a>that the involvement of the Indian High Commission was as ridiculous as US embassies celebrating Osama Bin Laden.</p>
      <p>Veeramani’s proposed visit perturbed Malaysian Tamils, who are against his visit as they consider him to be a part of the “Breaking India forces”.</p>
      <p>Malaysian Tamils wonder why the Indian High Commission was involved in the event in the first place and said that they have rejected Dravidian ideologies in Malaysia long ago.</p>
      <p>The uneasiness of the Malaysians stemmed from the commotion that Veeramani created in that country during his 2012 visit. At a meeting in Ipoh, he had disparaged Sri Krishna and the Hindu Sangam had condemned his comments thereafter.</p>
      <p>Probably, the hue and cry raised by the NGOs over what had happened in 2012 has forced the cancellation of the event now.</p>
