      <h1>Uber Embraces Videotaping Rides, Raising Privacy Concerns</h1>

      <p>For several months, some Uber passengers in Texas have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/uber-recording-rides-privacy.html">recorded on video as they have been driven to their destinations</a>. The video has been stored online and could have been reviewed by members of Uber's safety staff if the driver had reported a problem with the passenger. From a report:<i> The video recordings are part of a broad initiative at the ride-hailing company to capture more objective data about what happens inside vehicles during Uber trips, where disputes between riders and drivers often play out without witnesses. Uber has experienced years of complaints about the safety of its riders and drivers, who are often left to sort out episodes without the help of the company, and it has settled lawsuits claiming that it does not do enough to protect passengers. But as Uber increases the practice of recording drivers and passengers, the company is facing new privacy pressures. "Uber already has this treasure trove of highly personal data about people," said Camille Fischer, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "When you pair surveillance during those trips, whether it's over the driver or over the passenger, you are getting a more fine-tuned snapshot of people's daily lives." Uber began the video recording program in Texas in July, and is conducting smaller tests of the program in Florida and Tennessee. In November, it announced a similar effort in Brazil and Mexico to <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/11/20/2146202/uber-to-allow-audio-recording-of-rides-aiming-to-launch-feature-in-us">allow riders and drivers to record audio during a trip</a>.</i></p>
