      <h1>Fingerstyle guitarists Guy Buttery, Konarak Reddy take the stage in Bengaluru</h1>
      <h2>They will be supported by guitarist Rachanachar. Drummer Roberto Narain will join Konarak for a set</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:58:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Aparna-Narrain-21204/" target="_blank">Aparna Narrain</a></address>
      <p>This Friday, Bengalureans have the chance to listen to two well-known guitarists as Konarak Reddy and Guy Buttery will perform at Radisson Blu Atria. They will be supported by acoustic folk guitarist Rachanachar. Konarak will also be joined by drummer Roberto Narain.</p>
      <p>Known for his distinctive acoustic style, Guy from South Africa, is an internationally recognised artiste who has worked with the likes of Dave Matthews and Jethro Tull.</p>
      <p>Talking about what the audience can expect, he says, “I have had a fairly different set list for every show in India. That is interesting for me, and hopefully, for the audience (as well). There is going to be elements from African rhythms, Hindustani classical and world music. So, it is kind of a mixed bag.”</p>
      <p>Adding that it will be primarily acoustic guitar, Guy says he will be playing an African instrument called the kalimba as well.”</p>
      <p>He will also perform some songs with Rachanachar.</p>
      <p>Stating that it is his fifth trip to India (he even studied in Varanasi) but that he has not had any concerts here, Guy says of his maiden India tour, “It has been amazing; really special.”</p>
      <p>His association with Indian music started in 2016 when he met Indian-origin Ayurvedic doctor and music therapist Kanada Narahari, who is also a sitar player. “We connected because I was ill at one point and someone suggested I visit him. I discovered he was an amazing sitar player and singer; so we ended up doing several concerts in South Africa and recorded an album, <i>Nadi, </i>which came out recently.”</p>
      <p>On whether he has any plans to record songs or an album with any Indian artistes while here, Guy says, “We loved the Delhi performance with tabla player Amjad Khan and sarangi player Mudassir Khan so much that we ended up recording it in a studio. Let us see what happens with it.”</p>
      <h3>Konarak’s performance</h3>
      <p>As for his performance, Konarak says, “I will play my original works and maybe some songs by The Beatles, but all in fingerstyle guitar. That is more jazz and classical with lots of harmonies. Roberto, who I played with years earlier, will join me later. That is more percussion and we have a synth. It is all our own work but a little more dynamic. It is pretty different from what is happening in the city today.”</p>
      <p>Elaborating on his original compositions, Konarak says it has a “very Indian ethos”. Even my harmonies are not an imitation of the Western concepts of jazz. I try to take more from the city sounds of India and from Bengaluru and what I have grown up with. When you listen to it, you do not picture a European city. I want people to picture something that is contemporary in India.”</p>
      <p>He adds, “The set Roberto and I used to do years ago, we tried to recollect and put it together.”</p>
      <p>The work with Roberto aims to evoke the Bangalore of the 70s. Konarak says, “Bangalore was an awesome place. People were more connected. It was not so commercial. As a musician, if you tried to explore different music, the audience actually loved it. Today, either we imitate or ‘Bollywoodise’ it.”</p>
