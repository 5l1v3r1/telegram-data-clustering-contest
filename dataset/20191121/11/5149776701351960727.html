      <h1>'Have the city council got nothing better to do?' - your reaction to logo at Nottingham bar Billy Bootleggers</h1>
      <h2>The owners have launched a petition to keep it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:34:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:34</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>The news that the owners of Nottingham bar Billy Bootleggers have been <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/nottingham-bar-billy-bootleggers-ordered-3549044">ordered by the council to remove 'detrimental' signage</a> has prompted a barrage of comments from NottinghamshireLive readers - both in support and opposition.</p>
      <p>The giant logo emblazoned across the front of the property in the Lace Market, was painted without consent - and planners at Nottingham City Council say it spoils the appearance and character of the prominent building in Weekday Cross and impacts on the wider conservation area.</p>
      <p>Owners of the bourbon and live music <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/first-look-inside-new-nottingham-3393355">dive bar</a>, Eliot Towsley and Paul Skevington, have been warned that it must go, or enforcement action will be taken.</p>
      <p>They have eight weeks to appeal the decision - but in the meantime they have launched a petition entitled 'Save Billy's lovely logo.'</p>
      <p>They said: "We, as small business owners, are up against it from the minute we open the door. Unfortunately the powers that be (despite what they say) don't make it easy for us to succeed. They dip in to our shallow pockets at every opportunity and make things harder and harder as the years go by.</p>
      <p>"Rather than make us give up all it does is spur us on and make us work harder and longer. In a world full of large dominant brands and organisations as a small local business creating jobs in the local community it is important to get your name 'out there' as much as possible.</p>
      <p>"One way of doing that is by painting a massive version of your own logo on the outside of the building that you pay a small fortune for every month.</p>
      <p>"In the current climate how could having a painted logo on the outside of a privately owned non listed building be detrimental to a local area?</p>
      <p>"Billy is one of us little guys and deserves your support we think... it's not about upsetting people, it's simply about not being pushed about and not letting the few control the many."</p>
      <p>So far more nearly 200 people have signed the petition at Change.org.</p>

      <p>Comments on NottinghamshireLive's Facebook page were weighted in favour of the logo, saying it added character to a dull building and readers called on the council to do more to support independent businesses.</p>
      <p>Jean Sabin Blacow said: "Eyesore??? The biggest eyesore is the amount of empty shops, that is what the council should be doing something about."</p>
      <p>Steve Paul Belsham-Baker posted: "It looks quite good on the street and extends the Hockley vibe over, why make a pub waste money on a hobby project? Support businesses!"</p>
      <p>Luna Loki TeeTee pointed out: "They can paint rainbows on the street but you canâ€™t have a sign - seriously, have the city council got nothing better to do?"</p>
      <p>Gill Savage said it should stay, adding: "Job's a good one, it's art and adds character to a dull building."</p>
      <p>Jeanette Hudson responded: "The audacity of NCC! You've have ruined our city! You have the nerve to say this painted, I'll say it again painted, sign is an eyesore! Seriously you all need to go to Specsavers or you need sacking!"</p>
      <p>Nigel Orton commented: "Great bar, nothing wrong with the sign, no different to Albert's with that mural of Einstein. Council should sort the homeless problem and all the druggies hanging out in car park stairwells.</p>
      <p>Rich Stuart made the point. "If it was a Banksy piece the council would be all over the news saying how great it is for the city."</p>
      <p>The debate took a controversial turn when Meryl Whittington said: "I'd be more in favour of them pulling down the eyesore arts building opposite," referring to Nottingham Contemporary.</p>

      <p>Tara Coulter wrote: "How is it ok to have a huge graffiti monkey that serves no purpose, on the side of a building just a few doors up from Billy Bootleggers but it's not ok to have a bar's tasteful, white logo on the front of said bar?</p>
      <p>It is not causing any obstruction, it is not offensive, it purely shows that it is Billy Bootleggers. You could almost imagine it's <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/nottingham-bar-billy-bootleggers-ordered-3549044">Nottingham City Council</a> trying to cause more issues for publicans rather than supporting local businesses. Imagine that."</p>
      <p>But not everyone was in favour of the logo, including Julie Dewar, ho said: "Looks hideous! Get rid of it... what the hell were they thinking?"</p>
      <p>Jane Nattrass responded: "Good. It's an eyesore. They were aware that they should stay in the style of the building but chose not to and applied retrospectively. Unlucky."</p>
      <p>"It's a bit of an eyesore. The original architect would die of shock if he came back to life and saw that!" said Andrew Newton.</p>
