      <p>Havana, Cuba.- Based on the argument of the book <b>The last soldiers of the Cold War</b> by Brazilian writer Fernando Morais, the movie tells the story of five Cuban anti-terrorists -Gerardo Hernández, René González, Antonio Guerrero, Fernando González and Ramón Labañino- infiltrated in anti-Cuban groups in the United States to prevent attacks on their country coming from US territory during the 1990's. The co-production between France, Spain, Belgium and Brazil was screened during the 76th Venice International Film Festival and its cast includes renowned Spanish actress Penélope Cruz and Mexico's Gael García Bernal. The film has been successfully screened at important movie festivals, such as Toronto in Canada, San Sebastian in Spain and New York in the United States.</p>
