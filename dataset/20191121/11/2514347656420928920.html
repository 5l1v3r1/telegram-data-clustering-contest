      <h1>Get started with… Arduino?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:02:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/author/alexbate" target="_blank">Alex Bate</a></address>
      <p>Yes, you read that title right, and no, you haven’t accidentally stumbled upon the Arduino Foundation’s website. Today, we’re pleased to announce a new addition to the Raspberry Pi Press family: <i>Get Started with Arduino</i>, a complete how-to guide to help you get hands on with the <i>other</i> pocket-sized board.</p>

      <h3>But why?</h3>
      <p>Why not? Our mission is to put the power of computing and digital making into the hands of people all over the world. Whether you’re using a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, or any other piece of digital making kit, if you’re creating with tech, we’re happy. And Raspberry Pi and Arduino make wonderful project partners for all kinds of build.</p>
      <h3>What’s in the book?</h3>
      <p><i>Get Started with Arduino</i> is packed full of how-tos and project tutorials to help you get better acquainted with the little blue microcontroller. Whether you’re brand new to digital making, a die-hard Raspberry Pi fan looking to expand your maker skillset, or simply a bit of a bookworm, <i>Get Started with Arduino</i> is a super addition to your bookshelves.</p>

      <h3>Aren’t Raspberry Pi and Arduino the same kind of thing?</h3>
      <p>Arduino is a microcontroller, while Raspberry Pi is a full computer. Microcontrollers don’t usually run a mainstream operating system, but they’re extremely power-efficient, so they can be great for projects that can’t stay plugged into the mains. You need to use a separate computer to set up your Arduino, but you can do everything on a Raspberry Pi itself… including setting up an Arduino. As we said, the two work really well together in some projects: for example, you might build a robot where the Raspberry Pi handles intensive processing tasks and provides you with a friendly environment for developing your code, while the Arduino handles precise real-time control of the motors.</p>
