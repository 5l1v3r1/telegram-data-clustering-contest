      <p>Kaduna State Police Command has recovered 273 animals rustled in Kajuru Council of the state and arrest seven persons in connection to the crime.</p>
      <p>Deputy Commissioner of Police Department of Finance and Administration DCP Onah Ambrose in a press statement said the command recovered two hundred and forty-six (246) Cows, twenty-seven (27) Sheep suspected to have been rustled, a feat he said was achieved through “Community Policing”.</p>
      <p>According to him, “the Command received reliable information that there are suspected rustlers trying to move rustled cattle in large numbers to a location yet to be ascertained.</p>
      <p>“On receipt of the information, the Command immediately swung into action and intercepted the cattle and sheep around Iche Village near Kasuwan Magani in Kajuru Local Government area of Kaduna state and equally arrested the following suspects who are currently assisting Police investigation.</p>
      <p>“Yahuza Alhaji Zubairu 40 years, Abdullahi Shehu 30 years, Isa Alhaji Zubairu, Babangida Alhaji Zubairu, Sani Bello, Jamilu Yahuza and Aminu Yahuza.”</p>
      <p>DCP Ambrose, however, called on the general public in the State to rededicate themselves to the concept of civic responsibility to demonstrate personal and collective commitment in assisting the Police with timely and reliable information to be able to sustain the gain recorded and improve security in our communities in general.</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, I want to assure you that the suspects will be prosecuted accordingly upon completion of Police investigation and the cattle will be handed over to the real owners with verifiable proof of ownership,” Ambrose said.</p>
