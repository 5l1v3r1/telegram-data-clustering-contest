        <b>I’m A Celebrity star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts isn’t alone in her love for Jane McDonald, as Scarlett Moffatt admits she’s also fascinated by the Loose Women star.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/big-brother/">Big Brother</a> star Adele has kept us entertained this week when she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-fans-baffled-adele-roberts-chooses-framed-photo-jane-mcdonald-luxury-item-11178692/">revealed herself to be Jane’s number one fan</a>, after choosing a photo of the TV presenter as her luxury item in the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>While the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebritys-roman-kemp-and-adele-roberts-clash-as-he-mocks-jane-mcdonalds-legacy-thats-prejudice-11183514/">Roman Kemp have struggled to understand Adele’s fandom</a> for the Cruising star, Scarlett is right there with her.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <b>Metro.co.uk</b> in celebration of the National Lottery’s 25th anniversary, Scarlett explained: ‘I have said always for the past three years that my ideal candidate would be Jane McDonald.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like subconsciously I’ve made that happen.’</p>
      <p>Scarlett, 29, won I’m A Celebrity in 2016 and would have loved to have Jane as her campmate.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘Joel [Dommett] in my year, he took a framed photo of Ant &amp; Dec in but most people take in something they can actually use.</p>

      <p>‘But if Jane McDonald gets her through the hard times then who are we to judge?’</p>
      <p>Rightly so, Scarlett.</p>
      <p>The former I’m A Celebrity Extra Camp host has been absolutely gripped by this year’s series and is already making big predictions for the final.</p>
      <p>‘I honestly feel like it’s the best line-up yet. Caitlyn is amazing. I could watch her all day,’ she said.</p>

      <p>‘Jacqueline I love, I feel like she’s going to win. I know that’s a bold statement because it’s very early on. Roman, I feel like he’s definitely in the final.’</p>
      <p>This year’s campmates seem to be mostly getting along fine in the jungle and Scarlett doubts anyone will seriously lose their cool.</p>

      <p>She predicted: ‘I feel like it’s going to be a harmonious camp this year. I feel like we’re never going to have a Lady C moment.</p>
      <p>‘Even though it’s really entertaining, it’s nice watching people get on as well because the world is a bit crap but, maybe there’s never going to be a Lady C season. Maybe everyone’s just going to get on.’</p>
