      <p>Negotiators from the US and China could meet in the coming weeks as they attempt to work out the terms of an interim trade agreement, which was announced last month but has not yet been put to paper. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-invites-u-s-trade-negotiators-for-more-talks-11574330869">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> Thursday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He extended the invite to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a phone call last week. With an eye on tariff escalations scheduled to take place on December 15, the point person on trade negotiations for President Xi Jinping requested that the meeting take place in China before the US holiday next Thursday.</p>
      <p>But details including a date and location remain elusive. The US would be reluctant to travel to China without concessions on structural issues that have long been roadblocks in negotiations, according to The Journal, including rules on intellectual property and technology transfers. </p>
      <p>The two sides have separately <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-isnt-ready-to-sign-china-deal-white-house-advisers-2019-11-1028693854?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">clashed</a> over a potential agricultural purchase quota and whether tariffs should be rolled back as part of a broader agreement. </p>
      <p>Six weeks after the White House announced the so-called phase-one trade deal with China, those issues have dimmed hopes that an enforceable agreement could be reached in the near term. Trump has <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-threatens-to-raise-china-tariffs-if-no-trade-deal-2019-11-1028701809?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">repeatedly</a> said he was not ready to sign an agreement and threatened to expand tariffs to more Chinese products.</p>
      <p>"I haven't wanted to do it yet because I don't think they're stepping up to the level that I want," the president said during a visit to an Apple supplier facility in Texas on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The White House did not offer comment on whether the two sides could meet in the coming days, but a spokesperson said a day earlier that progress had been made on the text of the agreement. The USTR office and the Treasury Department did not respond to emails requesting comment.</p>
