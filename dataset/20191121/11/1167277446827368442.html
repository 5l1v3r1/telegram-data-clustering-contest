      <h1>Díaz-Canel: Socialist state enterprise must assume its rightful place</h1>

      <p>“There has not been an adequate reaction in the implementation of measures approved to improve the management of the socialist state enterprise. Obstacles that detain such efforts are always questioned, but today there is more agility in introducing measures to facilitate processes, than in their application,” said Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, President of the Republic, during a meeting with government boards, held this Wednesday at the Convention Center.</p>

      <p>“We have been taking steps to replace administrative mechanisms with economic-financial methods, but are not yet taking full advantage of our potential and are behind in developing productive chains between tourism, foreign investment, the non-state sector,” the President stated, in the meeting, where other topics were also addressed, including progress on meeting projections for the last part of the year and the implementation of decisions adopted to boost the economy.</p>
      <p>“Our import mentality holds us back, because it is easier to import than to think about productive chains, because these must be developed; it takes thought, incentives, structures to serve them, creativity, but this is what can lead to solid companies with true autonomy,” he asserted.Díaz-Canel continued, “Everything that is approved must be carried out, and we need to demonstrate viability, the success of the state enterprise as a fundamental element of the economy.”This effort, he said, has been launched in a particularly complex context, the tightening of the blockade, financial persecution, coupled with the tense political situation in the area.</p>
      <p>Hence the importance, he emphasized, of maintaining unity, of not allowing division or giving way to interference or manipulation.During the meeting, the President reiterated the need to continue with adequate ideological work among workers, while emphasizing the work of government boards as representatives of the state before the enterprise sector: “Their function is not to complete tasks, but to direct processes.</p>
      <p>It is about evaluating, proposing, ensuring that resources are not diverted, no shabby work…”In his recommendations, the President returned once again to the role of cadres, and noted that the best prepared should be identified; and also referred to the need to sustain the conservation measures implemented to overcome the fuel crisis, which has affected the country.</p>
      <p>He likewise reiterated priority work guidelines, including addressing food self-sufficiency at the municipal level, the cold season planting campaign, and the sugar harvest; strengthening tourism support, as well as university-government relations; the housing policy; confronting the problem of fuel theft; and ensuring that the enterprise sector takes full advantage of the potential of electronic government.</p>
      <p>“If companies take better advantage of the approved measures and comply with these directives, we will be thinking as a country; and that is the best way to celebrate the 61st anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution,” the President stated. <i>(Taken from en.granma.cu)</i></p>
