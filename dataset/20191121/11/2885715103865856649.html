      <p>Delhi managed to register a comfortable 77-run win over Maharashtra, but Dhawan (24 off 22 balls) failed to shine once again. Delhi made 167 for five after being invited to bat and produced a disciplined bowling effort to bundle out Maharashtra for 90 in 17.2 overs. Part-time off-spinner Nitish Rana stole the show with the ball with figures of four for 17.</p>
      <p>Dhawan will be out of action for 4-5 days because of the injury he suffered while fielding.</p>
      <p>Along with pictures of beaming hospital staff, Dhawan tweeted after the match: “We Fall, We Break, but then…. We Rise. We heal and we overcome, and the only thing you have control over is how you respond to any situation. Here’s to being positive and happy in every situation that life throws at you. Will be back in action in 4-5 days.”</p>
      <p>Dhawan’s India teammate Hardik Pandya had something to say after he saw the number of people in Dhawan’s recovery photos: “Haha Jatta pura hospital theek kar raha tha? (Were you helping the whole hospital recover?)”</p>

      <p>Dhawan’s scores in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy tournament have been 0, 9 off 6 balls, 19 off 18 balls, 35 off 33 balls and 24 off 22 balls.</p>
