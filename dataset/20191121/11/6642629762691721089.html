      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> President Donald Trump has said he hopes the release of two Western prisoners held hostage by the Afghan <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/taliban.html">Taliban</a> this week could help pave the way to an end to the war in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump thanked Afghan President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/ashraf-ghani.html">Ashraf Ghani</a> for his support in securing the release of US citizen Kevin King and Australian Tim Weeks as part of a prisoner swap <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/taliban-commanders-land-qatar-part-prisoner-swap-move-191119052250266.html">reportedly involving</a> three Taliban commanders.</p>

      <p>"We join the families of Kevin King &amp; Tim Weeks in celebrating their release from Taliban captivity. Thanks to President Ghani for his courageous support.</p>
      <p>"Let's hope this leads to more good things on the peace front like a ceasefire that will help end this long war. Proud of my team!" Trump said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Sources told Al Jazeera that the three released Taliban commanders, which included senior leader Anas Haqqani had <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/taliban-commanders-land-qatar-part-prisoner-swap-move-191119052250266.html">landed in Qatar</a> on Tuesday - the country hosts the Taliban's political office at the request of the US.</p>
      <p>King and Weeks, both university professors, had been held by the Taliban for three years and were under US military custody prior to being reunited with their families, according to a statement by the US State Department.</p>
      <h3>Ending an 18-year conflict</h3>
      <p>The prisoner swap came after Ghani announced on November 12 that Haqqani and the two other commanders would be freed.</p>
      <p>Haqqani is the son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, founder of the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/haqqani-network.html">Haqqani Network</a> - a Taliban affiliate. His older brother Sirajuddin now leads the group.</p>
      <p>At the time, Ghani said the decision was made after consultations with the US and was aimed at "facilitating face-to-face negotiations directly with the Taliban", who have, until now, refused to engage with what it calls an illegitimate, US-backed "puppet" government.</p>
      <p>The Taliban seized power in 1996 and ruled Afghanistan until 2001 when it was dislodged from power in 2001 by a US-led invasion.</p>
      <p>Renewed efforts to end the country's 18-year conflict have been stepped up recently, with US special representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad visiting <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/pakistan.html">Pakistan</a> last month to meet the Taliban's top negotiator, Mullah <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/profile-abdul-ghani-baradar-taliban-political-head-qatar-190125080255220.html">Abdul Ghani Baradar</a>.</p>
      <p>Washington said Khalilzad was in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, to follow up on talks he held in September in New York with Pakistani officials, including Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/imran-khan.html">Imran Khan</a>. The administration insisted Khalilzad was not in Pakistan to restart US-Taliban peace talks.</p>
      <p>The meeting was the first that Khalilzad had held with the Taliban since Trump declared in September that the peace talks, which were held in Qatar over the past year, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/trump-taliban-peace-talks-dead-190909183728653.html">were "dead"</a>.</p>
