      <p>While Ernst Middendorp has three suspensions to deal with for Kaizer Chiefs on Sunday afternoon, one player seems to have given him a boost for their Telkom Knockout semi-final.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Kearyn Baccus has played for the Glamour Boys since having to be taken off in the TKO quarter-final win over Cape Town City over a month ago back in October, and while Middendorp’s side have won all four games since then, his return will come as a bonus for the German coach.</p>
      <p>Chiefs go up against their coach’s former employers, Maritzburg United, this weekend as the two teams lock horns for a place in the final of this year’s tournament, and the midfield man is thought to be back in full training and available for selection ahead of Sunday’s game.</p>
      <p>The Siya crew recently reported that Baccus could make a return for Chiefs this weekend, and with the 28-year-old back with the team as they prepare to face the Team of Choice, he’s in contention to return to the matchday squad when they travel to Nelspruit.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether Middendorp will look to bring the midfielder straight into the XI given Willard Katsande’s suspension, or whether he needs more time before getting a full game under his belt, but fans will be pleased to see their new signing drawing close to a return regardless. </p>
