      <p>Electric vehicle drivers in Kelowna now have four charging options across the city.</p>
      <p>FortisBC and the City of Kelowna recently installed two new direct current fast charge stations at Rutland’s Centennial Park on Shepherd Road, and the Kelowna Museum parking lot on Ellis Street. </p>
      <p>These are in addition to two charging stations opened in June at Kelowna International Airport.</p>
      <p>“These stations make fast charging readily available for drivers at the three points of entry into our community and close to city centres in Rutland and downtown," said Mayor Colin Basran.</p>
      <p>With 10 per cent of all new vehicles purchased in B.C. now electric, expansion of the charging network supports growth and emissions reduction goals, particularly in B.C. where 98 per cent of electricity generation is clean power, the city said in a press release.</p>
      <p>The stations can charge a compact electric vehicle in about 30 minutes, as compared to a Level-2 station that requires about three to four hours.</p>
      <p>Users will be charged $9 per 30-minute charge, says Fortis.</p>
      <p>“Partnering with communities and all levels of government to build EV charging infrastructure is one of the ways we’re working to reduce our customers’ emissions by 30 per cent by 2030,” said Michael Leyland with Fortis. </p>
      <p>The new stations are part of 12 announced earlier this year by Fortis, bringing its planned network to 17 across 14 Southern Interior communities by the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>The city contributed land and partial funding for the Kelowna stations. </p>
      <p>Combined federal and provincial rebates of $8,000 are offered on electric vehicle purchases. Residents can also take advantage of incentives for at home and workplace charging stations.
