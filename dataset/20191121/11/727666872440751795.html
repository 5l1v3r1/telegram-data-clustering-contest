      <p>One moment with Cardi B in a club has reignited beef between female rap fans.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Nicki Minaj's stanbase had their digital knives out for Kash Doll this week. The Barbz were upset that Kash unfollowed their favorite rapper on social media and was seen partying with Nicki's rival Cardi B in New York City.</p>
      <p>"It was so good to kick it wit Cardi last night.... she cool af! A whole bunch of misunderstandings but grown women can kick it and let that sh*t go! I f*ck wit her ❤️," tweeted Kash on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Barbz then invaded Kash Doll's mentions on Twitter. Some of them threatened to stop listening to her music, and others called her phony. The Detroit native had to go to Instagram Live to explain why she no longer follows Minaj.</p>
      <p>"I unfollowed Nicki two weeks ago because when y'all was dragging me for whatever the f*ck y'all was dragging me for and I told y'all to leave my name out y'all mouth, she came in my DMs talking crazy. I unfollowed her ass and told her she was delusional, just like y'all motherf*ckers," said the <i>Stacked</i> album creator.</p>
      <p>She also added, "I don't want beef with nobody. That's why me and Cardi came together, to show that this is unity. Stop trying to put me up against [like] I'm trying to beef. And I'm still going to like Nicki Minaj, but she just came at me sideways, so I motherf*cking unfollowed her. I'm human. The f*ck?"</p>
