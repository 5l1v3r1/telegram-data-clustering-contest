      <p>Briton <a href="http://concisenews.global/sports">Anthony Joshua</a> said his first career defeat at the hands of Andy Ruiz Jr. was due to a lack of experience and he had become a “smarter” fighter ahead of December’s rematch.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that Mexican-American Ruiz produced one of boxing’s biggest upsets when he <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/06/02/andy-ruiz-humiliates-anthony-joshua-to-claim-heavyweight-titles-video/">dethroned the previously undefeated world heavyweight champion with a seventh-round stoppage</a> at New York’s Madison Square Garden in June.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t burnout. The issues I faced in the last camp, it’s just down to lack of experience,” he told BBC.</p>
      <p>“Even though it was at a high level, we were still finding experience.</p>
      <p>“Andy Ruiz is good but I don’t think he should beat me twice. I used to hear guys say you have to take a loss and I would think ‘why’?</p>
      <p>“Now I can understand it and know what it takes. I have more understanding now and my ears are open to new information so that’s making me smarter as a fighter,” Joshua said.</p>
      <p>The WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight title rematch – dubbed the ‘Clash on the Dunes’, will take place in Saudi Arabia on Dec. 7 after former Olympic Champion Joshua triggered a rematch clause.</p>
      <p>“The blessing is I have a second chance and here we are,” the 30-year-old said.</p>
