      <p>Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Princess Margaret in the third and fourth season of Netflix's <i>The Crown</i>, says America's fascination with the royal family is a case of wanting what they can't have.</p>
      <p>"It's your own fault, you tore away, you renounced our king," the English actress says jokingly.</p>
      <p>Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth's only sister, left a complicated legacy when she died in 2002. Often viewed as a tragic outcast compared to her more-popular sister, Carter hopes to shed a more nuanced light on the misunderstood princess.</p>
      <p>"No one is going to be the narrative they are in the press," Carter said. "It's very hard to be famous and vulnerable, and I think she was a very vulnerable person.... She was also incredibly brave."</p>
      <p>Bravery is something the Oscar-nominated actress knows a thing or two about, considering she's made a career of playing boldly unique characters from Marla Singer in <i>Fight Club</i> (1999) to Princess Margaret's mother Elizabeth in <i>The King's Speech</i> (2010).</p>

      <p><b>What did you learn about Princess Margaret, and what do you hope viewers take from your portrayal?</b><br/>There's a lot of presumption saying she had a tragic life. But I think she had a lot of fun. The narrative in the press about her is a cartoon. I hope that I might have shown somewhat the difficulties of her situation. Hopefully, I got under her skin.</p>
      <p><b>You've played a number of royals over the course of your career. Have you ever heard from them about your portrayals?</b><br/>Not really. They know who I am. I remember the Queen actually introducing me to Obama, saying "She's in a film called <i>The King's Speech</i>."</p>
      <p><b>Princess Margaret, like yourself, was a bit of a gay icon. Why do you think that is?</b><br/>She is a lesson in camp. Loads of her friends were gay, and I think she felt very comfortable with them; they were kindred spirits. But I think she definitely felt she didn't quite fit in with her family.</p>
      <p><b>It's the 20th anniversary of <i>Fight Club</i>. How did that film impact your career?</b><br/>Privately that's more my style. In fact, I have Marla Singer's jacket, it's the one jacket I wear to this day. It's a Rick Owens original. But that did have a massive impact, that film has lasted. Which is great vindication because when it first came out it was booed at screenings in Venice.</p>
