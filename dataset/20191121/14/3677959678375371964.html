In addition, one of the long-term goals is to contribute to the resolution of shared global issues extending beyond Sony's business domains.<br/>Sony AI will drive the research and development of AI in both physical and virtual space through multiple world-class flagship projects as well as other explorative research projects, including AI ethics.<br/>Initially, it will launch three flagship projects in the areas of gaming, imaging &amp; sensing, and gastronomy.

Recognizing the power and influence of AI technologies, Sony AI will contribute to society through the development of AI that is fair, transparent, and accountable.</blockquote>

Truth to be told, while graphics, physics and sound have massively improved over recent years, the AI at the very base of non-player characters (NPCs) didn't get the same enhancements. Hopefully that will change with the next generation of hardware, which is also set to deliver a significant CPU performance leap from the AMD Jaguar-derived PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to the AMD Zen 2-based <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-every-official-news-leak-rumor-on-sonys-next-gen-console/">PlayStation 5</a> and Project Scarlett (next Xbox).</p>
