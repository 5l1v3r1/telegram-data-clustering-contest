      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/gs-stock">Goldman Sachs</a> CEO David Solomon is pushing back against claims of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-card-faces-investigation-over-gender-discrimination-allegation-2019-11">gender discrimination</a> in the process for setting credit limits for the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock">Apple</a> Credit Card.</p>
      <p>"There's no gender bias in our process for extending credit," Solomon said in an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/goldman-s-ceo-defends-apple-card-says-there-s-no-gender-bias">Bloomberg TV</a> late Thursday. "We don't ask whether — when someone applies — if they're a man or a woman. We don't ask if they're married."</p>
      <p>He continued: "There's no question that different applicants can get different results, and that can be for a variety of reasons." </p>
      <p>Solomon said the bank also works with a third-party consultant to ensure there are no unintended biases on its credit platforms, which is required by law in the United States. </p>
      <p>Goldman plans to find ways to provide more transparency to customers around how credit decisions are made, Solomon added. </p>
      <p>The Apple Card came in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-card-faces-investigation-over-gender-discrimination-allegation-2019-11">under pressure</a> in early November following a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1192946583832158208">viral tweets</a> from web programmer and author David Heinemeier Hansson claiming he received 20 times the credit limit of his wife. </p>
      <p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak responded to the thread, sharing that he had a similar experience with his wife when they applied for the card. </p>
      <p>Following the complaints, the New York Department of Financial Services has launched an investigation into Goldman's algorithmic practices around the card, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-09/viral-tweet-about-apple-card-leads-to-probe-into-goldman-sachs">Bloomberg</a>. </p>
      <p>Solomon also said during the interview Thursday that the Apple Card "by any standard" has been the most successful co-branded credit card launch to date. </p>
