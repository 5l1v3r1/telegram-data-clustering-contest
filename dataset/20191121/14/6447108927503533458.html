      <h1>Life Is Strange 2 X Centrepoint campaign targets youth homelessness in the UK</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:20:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author">Stefan L</a></address>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/21/life-is-strange-2-episode-5-preview-daniel-morality-politics-in-games/">Life Is Strange 2 heads to its conclusion</a>, Square Enix UK have partnered with Centrepoint, a UK charity dedicated to helping young people facing homelessness. They’ve launched the We Will Be Heard campaign with the hashtag #The22000, looking to petition the next UK government to take meaningful action to help the tens of thousands of young homeless throughout the country.</p>
      <p>To help promote the issue – which is currently making headlines in the UK elections, as a general increase in people sleeping rough of 165% since 2010 is highlighted – Square Enix will be promoting the charity through their social media channels and hosting livestreams with content creators, while Centrepoint have created street art that will be up around London from this week.</p>

      <p>Centrepoint offer advice for anyone in England aged 16-25, whether homeless or at risk, or if it’s someone you’re concerned about. To get in touch, call free on 0808 800 0661 (Monday-Friday, 9AM-5PM), or <a href="https://centrepoint.org.uk/youth-homelessness/get-help-now/">head here for other contact options</a>.</p>
      <p>Paul Brocklehurt Head of Helpline at Centrepoint explained the charity’s work to us; “Centrepoint is one of the leading charities for youth homelessness in the UK, so we offer accommodation for young people in some parts of the country, but as well as a roof over their heads, we also give them the skills and support so that they can go on to live independently.”</p>
      <p>There is also a national helpline that people can ring up to get support, whether they’re homeless or are at risk. Given the themes present in the game, it’s a natural fit, as protagonists Sean and Daniel go on the run and hitchhike down the West Coast of America. This follows in the footsteps of the earlier games where they worked with anti-bullying and mental health awareness charities.</p>
      <p>Becca Cousins, Senior Direct Marketing Officer, said “One of the main differences is that obviously that the game is set in America, and over here [in the UK] we do have a social welfare system. In spite of that, there are over 100,000 young people who are at risk or who are homeless. These are people who’ve gone to their local council and said ‘I’m homeless, I’m at risk,’ and so we need to deal with a huge issue in the UK.”</p>
      <p>She continued, “It gives you a small glimmer of some of the really, really difficult decisions that some of our young people go through. Like, do you steal the chocolate bar or go hungry? Do you sleep on the street or stay in a stranger’s house that can lead to a whole host of other problems? We feel that the game dealt with this in a very mature way.</p>
      <p>“We want to highlight that if you are in this situation or know someone in this situation, we are here and have the helpline which can offer advice.”</p>
      <p>Once again, to get in touch with Centrepoint, call free on 0808 800 0661 (Monday-Friday, 9AM-5PM), or <a href="https://centrepoint.org.uk/youth-homelessness/get-help-now/">head here for other contact options</a>.</p>
