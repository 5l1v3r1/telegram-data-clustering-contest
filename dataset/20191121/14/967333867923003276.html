      <p>Residents of the Philippine island of Mindanao were shocked when they found a giant cobra in a rice field. The people panicked and killed the snake, but were left puzzled when they found another serpent inside the cobra.</p>
      <p>The 3.6-metre (12-feet) cobra had apparently swallowed a reticulated python of about three metres (nine feet) in length, with only the victim's tail poking out of its mouth. </p>
