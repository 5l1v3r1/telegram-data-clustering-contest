      <p>Hong Kong health officials announced today the investigation into a case of human infection of rat Hepatitis E virus (HEV). The case involves an 82-year-old woman with underlying illnesses, who had presented with jaundice, poor appetite and tea-coloured urine since October 7. She was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on October 21 and was discharged after treatment. The patient is now in a stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for rat HEV upon laboratory testing.</p>
      <p>The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health’s  epidemiological investigations revealed that the patient resided in Kowloon City District. She could neither recall having direct contact with rodents or their excreta, nor had noticed rodents in her residence. She had no travel history during the incubation period and her home contacts have remained asymptomatic so far.</p>
      <p>“Based on the available epidemiological information, the source and the route of infection could not be determined. The CHP’s investigation is ongoing,” a spokesman for the CHP said.</p>
