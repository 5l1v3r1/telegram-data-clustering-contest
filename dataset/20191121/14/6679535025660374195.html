      <p>With a majority of establishments yet to to ensure that 60% of the signage is in Kannada, the BBMP has decided to extend the deadline till the end of November before either cancelling trade licences or not renewing them.</p>
      <p>In October, BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar had issued an order making it compulsory for all business establishments in the city to give prominence to Kannada in their signage by November 1, which is celebrated as Karnataka Rajyotsava. The order stated that the civic body would cancel trade licences of establishments that did not comply.</p>
      <p>“More than 8,500 business establishments across the city have complied,” said Vijayendra, Chief Health Officer, BBMP.</p>
      <p>So far, the BBMP has issued more than 14,800 notices to establishments that are yet to comply.</p>
      <p>The notices, he added, were not for the purpose of penalising the businesses or trades. “We are placing on record that the premises of the business establishments have been inspected, and the employees/owners have been apprised of the new rule. There is still time for the businesses to carry out the change,” he said.</p>
      <p>Many multinational companies and corporates have sought more time from the civic body to make the changes. “They explained that they will need clearance from their head office or will have to have a resolution passed in a board meeting. We have asked them to give the same in writing,” he added.</p>
