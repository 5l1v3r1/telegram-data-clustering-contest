      <h1>The Daily Chase: Ontario mulls overhauling pot licence system; Kenney takes aim at Encana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:17:01+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/talent/noah-zivitz-1.451955" target="_blank">Noah Zivitz</a></address>
      <p>Doug Ford’s Ontario government is considering a proposal to overhaul the way pot store licences are awarded in the province, where the slow roll out of retail shops has invited an onslaught of criticism from some of the country’s largest cannabis producers. A source directly familiar with the matter told BNN Bloomberg’s David George-Cosh Ontario government officials are looking to abandon the existing lottery process in favour of an “open allocation” system that could eventually lay the groundwork to have upward of 1,000 pot stores operating in the province.

        <b>KENNEY ON ENCANA</b>
      </p>
      <p>There were a couple of pregnant pauses as Alberta Premier Jason Kenney stewed on his choice of words when asked by Greg Bonnell about Encana/Ovintiv’s redomiciling. “I was not disappointed to see that Encana’s share price dropped by 10 per cent after [the announcement],” he said before winding up with this line: “The truth is that they were overextended on the natural gas side of things obviously before prices crashed and they’ve suffered the results of that.” Watch for the full interview, including his reaction to the new federal cabinet and his message to investors in Texas, on The Street and BNNBloomberg.ca. For the sake of accuracy: Encana’s shares fell 6.7 per cent on the day its redomiciling (and quarterly results) were announced.</p>

        <b>SCHWAB-AMERITRADE REPORTEDLY NEAR DEAL</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are multiple reports this morning that Charles Schwab is nearing an agreement to buy its online brokerage rival TD Ameritrade, with Fox Business reporting the deal could be worth US$26 billion. Lots of threads for us to pull on, most notably the motivation for a deal as investing trends evolve and pricing power collapses in the U.S. Then there’s the question of regulatory risk and what’s been happening behind the scenes after the surprise announcement in July about Tim Hockey preparing to step aside as Ameritrade’s CEO. And the stakes for Toronto-Dominion Bank, which owns a 43 per cent interest in Ameritrade, are obviously significant.</p>
