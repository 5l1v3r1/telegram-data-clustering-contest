      <h1>Calls for Rachel Riley to quit countdown over 'Jeremy Corbyn is a racist' T-Shirt</h1>

        <b>Countdown presenter Rachel Riley has came-under-fire for wearing a T-shirt featuring a doctored image of Jeremy Corbyn on the front.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rachel Riley's white T-shirt featured an old picture of  the UK Labour Party leader with the phrase "Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour," emblazoned across the front.</p>
      <p>The original photo was taken in 1984, and it shows Corbyn being arrested while protesting the South African apartheid.</p>
      <p>However, the real slogan printed on Corbyn's placard, which read: "Defend the right to protest against apartheid. Join this picket," has been doctored for the tee to read 'Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour'.</p>
      <p>Riley was snapped wearing the controversial T-shirt while leaving the ITV studios in Salford, following Tuesday's televised leaders' debate.</p>
      <p>Sharing an image of herself on Twitter, Rachel wrote: "I didn’t feel comfortable knowing my workplace was to be full of racists tonight.</p>
      <p>"I don’t endorse Boris, but I do endorse #NeverCorbyn.</p>
      <p>"Please see my pinned thread if you still don’t understand why. #LeadersDebate #LabourAntisemitism."</p>

      <p>However, the move has not gone down well online, with people taking to Twitter to fume at Riley and call for her to leave the show.</p>
      <p>One Corbyn supporter wrote: "Jeremy Corbyn spent the 80s campaigning against Apartheid &amp; fighting for the rights of working people. Boris Johnson spent it burning money in front of homeless people &amp; smashing up restaurants for fun. Learn your history Rachel Riley!"</p>
      <p>One person wrote: "Channel 4 I am disgusted that you have an employee of yours - Rachel Riley - stamping all over the history of protest for black rights in this country. She skewed an image of Jeremy Corbyn protesting for an end to apartheid and replaced it with her own message that he’s racist."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Yep @Channel4 definitely needs to sack Rachel Riley #sackRachelRiley #sackRachelRiley #sackRachelRiley."</p>
      <p>While one wrote: "Disgraceful from Rachel Riley, she should be sacked with immediate effect!! Should be held accountable for her slander."</p>
      <p>Rachel however, has defended her decision, taking to Twitter this morning to say: "Without feeding individual ignorant trolls, this is why I have no qualms using this photo to highlight Corbyn’s racism."</p>
      <p>She the shared articles about Nelson Mandela declining to meet Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-apartheid movement.</p>
      <p>In a follow-up tweet, the Countdown star said: "Trying to brand me as racist for this, whist lauding themselves as anti-racist heroes, shows just how little regard many people have for anti-Jewish racism, and why I and many others speak so loudly. It’s a hatred which unites the far right, far left and is having a resurgence."</p>
      <p>"I won’t dignify this with any further response &amp; I won’t tolerate abuse from those who choose to rank one form of racism over another, that’s hypocrisy. They’re all unacceptable. End of. If this is what it takes to highlight the nastiness of these people then fine."</p>
