      <p>The 22-year-old has been in impressive form for the Foxes during the 2019-20 campaign, scoring once and providing three assists in 10 Premier League appearances.</p>
      <p>Manchester United and Manchester City have both been linked with a move for the left-back, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> are thought to be preparing a mid-season offer should the London club be successful in appealing their transfer suspension, which for the moment is still in place until next summer.</p>
      <p>However, according to the <i>London Evening Standard</i>, Leicester would not be prepared to sell the England international to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a>'s side at the start of 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brendan-rodgers/"><b>Brendan Rodgers</b></a>'s team are in a strong position when it comes to Chilwell's future as the full-back has a contract at the King Power Stadium until the end of the 2023-24 campaign.</p>
      <p>Neither <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/emerson-palmieri/"><b>Emerson Palmieri</b></a> nor <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcos-alonso/"><b>Marcos Alonso</b></a> have convinced at left-back for Chelsea this season despite the team's impressive form under their new head coach.</p>
