      <h1>1800 New Police, Delivered</h1>

      <p>New Zealand First is proud to have delivered on a key Coalition Agreement commitment to adding 1800 new frontline police, with the graduation of Recruit Wing 332 in Porirua today.</p>
      <p>Law and Order Spokesperson Darroch Ball says increasing police numbers and boosting their resources was one of the first orders of the day in government for New Zealand First.</p>
      <p>“We recognise that the presence of Police in our neighbourhoods and towns is one of the most powerful ways to deter crime and build safer communities.</p>
      <p>"This milestone represents the continuation of New Zealand First's proud legacy of supporting our men and women in blue while in government.</p>
      <p>“In government in 1996, we increased police numbers by 500. In 2005, we increased police numbers by 1000. Now, we have delivered the largest expansion in frontline police numbers in over a century.</p>
      <p>“As part of this expansion, we have also committed to a serious focus on regional policing. Northland, for instance, has received a massive 25% increase in police numbers, which will help combat organised crime and improve public safety in the region.</p>
      <p>“The previous National Government froze Police funding while our population soared. We, on the other hand, have increased annual Police funding to an estimated $2 billion and delivered the largest police force in New Zealand history.</p>
      <p>"That's the effect of having New Zealand First in government," says Mr Ball.</p>
