      <p>The Senate on Thursday passed an amendment that will ensure collection of tax from transaction on YouTube, Google, Amazon and other online transactions.</p>
      <p>The lawmakers’ resolution was sequel to the consideration of the report of Senate Committee on Finance, which was presented by Senator Olamilekan Adeola.</p>
      <p>According to Adeola, all transactions through Google, Amazon, Jumia and Ali Baba among others will now attract tax as a result of passage of the Finance Bill by the Senate.</p>
      <p>It could be recalled that the Finance Bill 2019 was presented together with the 2020 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly by the President Muhammadu Buhari on October 14, 2019.</p>
