      <p>Orange will soon start selling its first 5G-ready own-brand smartphone, called Neva Jet, in Poland and Romania, with more markets to follow. Customers in Poland <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/orange-poland-starts-testing-5g-in-lublin--1313453">are already testing the handset</a> in locations where the operator is conducting 5G trials. In this country, however, the Neva Jet will initially be available on existing 3G/4G networks for its commercial launch, expected in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Availability on 5G will follow across Europe as the networks are switched on, said the company, <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/orange-romania-launches-5g-in-three-cities--1314903">starting with Romania</a> by the end of the year. More own-brand, 5G-compatible phones will be added to the Neva range during 2020.</p>
      <p>The Neva Jet features a 6.5-inch full HD+ borderless screen and a triple camera, including a 48-megapixel wide-angle lens and 20-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens. Running on Android Pie, it comes with a high-performance processor (855 Qualcomm Snapdragon), an in-display fingerprint sensor, and an ultra-fast charging battery (4,000 mAh). It also integrates Orange Experience software for personalised recommendations and partner offers, as well as facial recognition and AI capabilities to manage stored content.</p>
      <p>While the price of the Neva Jet has yet to be confirmed, three LTE models in the new own-brand range are already being marketed on the Orange online shop and will be sold in six European markets (France, Spain, Romania, Poland, Slovakia and Moldova). For French consumers, the price of the entry-level smartphone, the Neva Start, is currently EUR 69.90 when purchased without a plan. In comparison, the Neva Zen and Neva Play retail for EUR 99.90 and EUR 145 respectively.Â </p>
