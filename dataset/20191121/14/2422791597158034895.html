      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. -- The U.S. Department of Food and Drug Administration is being called to investigate a short-lived pilot program that sought to treat inmates with anti-addiction implants never approved by federal regulators.</p>
      <p>The Advocate reports advocacy group Public Citizen requested the probe in a letter Wednesday. The pilot by the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections and California-based creator BioCorRx, Inc. involved a surgical implant that released the opioid and addiction fighting drug naltrexone.</p>
      <p>Officials said the chemical would be metabolized over several months. The FDA already approved naltrexone as daily pills and monthly shots.</p>
      <p>BioCorRx offered the corrections department 10 free implants for volunteer recipients. For unclear reasons, the pilot stopped after the first implant. Recipient 39-year-old Alvin Dutruch says he has been doing well in recovery since his release.</p>
