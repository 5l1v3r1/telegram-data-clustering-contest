      <h1>Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa comments on Mauricio Pochettino after Tottenham sack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:15:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa has told his pre-Luton Town press conference – <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/pablo-hernandez-live-press-conference-17292406">as quoted by Leeds Live</a> – as saying that he is upset at Tottenham Hotspur’s decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino, but reckons he could be in a new job in “15 days”.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was relieved of his duties on Tuesday night after a very poor start to the campaign. Tottenham currently sit in 14th place and Jose Mourinho has been tasked with resurrecting Spurs and pushing them back into the top-four places.</p>
      <p>Bielsa is renowned for his relationship with Pochettino. The former signed Pochettino as a 13-year-old at Newell’s Old Boys, and brought him into the Argentina national team. They are believed to converse regularly.</p>
      <p>Asked about Pochettino’s exit from Tottenham, Bielsa stated that he was upset at the decision. He also spoke of how Pochettino could have a new job in “15 days” and that he has left Mourinho with an excellent squad.</p>

      <p>“I like and love him a lot,” Bielsa said. “It upsets me. When something not good happens to him I cannot ignore this. If we see the close effect of this situation we can be sad. I feel sad. In 15 days he will be at the top again.</p>
      <p>“Now he leaves a team that is attractive to Mourinho. This is a big achievement. The next team he receives will create that respect. The work Pochettino has done is brilliant.”</p>
      <p>Pochettino only saw his Spurs side win three of their 12 league games this season, while also being knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Colchester United during a penalty shootout. They suffered a huge 7-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in Europe.</p>
      <p>Spurs go to London rivals West Ham on Saturday lunchtime at the London Stadium, and will be looking to inflict further damage on the out-of-form Hammers who have failed to win in their last seven games.</p>
