      <p>While some of us won't have to worry if there will be enough presents under the tree this year, there are many families that do.</p>
      <p>The Okanagan Boys and Girls Clubs' Adopt-A-Family program pairs families with organizations and individuals to help ensure that families have a happy holiday.</p>
      <p>For the past 12 years, sponsors have put together gift and food hampers for families that may not be able to do it themselves for the holiday season.</p>
      <p>"We hope you will consider adopting a family this holiday season and help make a family in our community have a little brighter holiday," says Richelle Leckey from Okanagan Boys and Girls Clubs. "Thank you for bringing joy in a time of need."</p>
      <p>To learn more about the program and how you can be a part of it, you can visit their <a href="https://www.boysandgirlsclubs.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2019/10/Adopt-a-family-2019-OBGC.pdf">website</a>.</p>
