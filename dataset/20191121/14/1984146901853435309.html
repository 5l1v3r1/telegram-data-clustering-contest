        <figcaption>Ace from Gladiators went from earning £20k a day to £20 after 'crashing down to reality'</figcaption>

      <p>He used to earn £2,000 an hour flexing his muscles on TV.</p>
      <p>Now, former Gladiators star Warren Furman - better known as Ace - has revealed he sometimes struggles to earn £20 an hour since the show finished.</p>
      <p>The muscle man enjoyed living the high life filled with fast cars, first-class travel and no shortage of female attention during his time as one of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> programme’s stars.</p>
      <p>But suddenly he found himself jobless and searching for work on a building site, worrying about how he was going to make ends meet.</p>

      <p>Gladiators aired between 1992 and 2000, racking up a total of eight series, with Warren joining the show in series five, the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/ace-gladiators-i-used-earn-17288016">MEN reports.</a></p>
      <p>He appeared on ITV's This Morning on Thursday and spoke of his "crash down into the real world" as he adjusted to life away from the hit Saturday night gameshow.</p>
      <p>He told hosts <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/holly-willoughby">Holly Willoughby</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phillip-schofield">Phillip Schofield</a> : "When you've had something like that and it's taken away from you and you're not earning a living out of it anymore, and all people want to know is daft stuff - well it seemed daft because now I wasn't earning any money.</p>
      <p>“I came crashing down into the real world. I could earn £2,000 an hour on Gladiators, now I'm lucky if I could get £20 an hour.</p>
      <p>"Then people are coming over like, 'What's Ulrika like? What's Wolf like?' and in the end I was a bit like, 'I'm not actually public property any more, I'm just trying to make a living, so I don't really want to talk about it anymore.'</p>
      <p>"I know that sounds conceited, but I felt like I was living in the past.”</p>
      <p>The bodybuilder also spoke of his doomed relationship with Katie Price, whom he dated in the late 90s during the height of her glamour model days as Jordan.</p>
      <p>He said: “We were very similar people, we both grew up in similar circumstances, working class.</p>
      <p>“We both took our clothes off for a living in a way. I wore the lycra. We had a lot of time together as well.”</p>
      <p>Addressing why they split, he added: “We were both deriving our identities from being relevant in the media. We were both selling stories.”</p>
