        <b>A Mexican church has commissioned a huge statue of the baby Jesus that looks pretty much exactly like singer Phil Collins.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The sculpture was commissioned for the church La EpifanIa del Señor, according to the <i><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/church-builds-huge-baby-jesus-statue-that-looks-like-phil-collins/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter">New York Post.</a> </i></p>
      <p>It is 22-feet tall, weighs over 2,000 pounds — and against all odds it somehow looks more like the lead singer of Genesis than the son of God.</p>
      <p>The church's priest Humberto Rodriguez said that he only wanted something that would "fit the church."</p>
      <p>He was taken aback by the size of the statue once it arrived saying he "never intended to make it the biggest baby Jesus statue in the world."</p>
      <p>Whether it actually takes the record has yet to be confirmed, but it’s certainly f***ing massive.</p>
      <p>"There is a space of between 26 feet between the ceiling and the floor and I ordered a statue measuring 21 feet, but I never intended to make it the biggest baby Jesus statue in the world," he says.</p>

      <p>Can't wait to see that church's crib this Christmas, currently wondering if Joseph will look like Peter Gabriel.</p>
      <p>The Guinness record-holder for tallest statue of Jesus Christ is 'Christ the King.' It measures 120-feet tall and is located in Swiebodzin, Poland and was completed on November 6, 2010.</p>
      <p>Even if this isn't the biggest Jesus statue in the world, however, we're pretty sure it's the biggest Phil Collins one.<br/>Phil himself has not commented on the statue, but we do know him and the son of god are pretty well acquainted...</p>
