        <b>Jose Mourinho will begin his Tottenham tenure by renewing acquaintances with West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini at London Stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini would not deem Jose Mourinho his enemy or his friend as the long-time rivals prepare for a Premier League reunion on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini’s struggling West Ham welcome Tottenham and their freshly installed head coach Mourinho to London Stadium this weekend, reprising a rivalry that has simmered for a decade.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was publicly courted by Real Madrid before being appointed at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2010, replacing Pellegrini despite the sacked Chilean having led Los Blancos to a then club-record haul of 96 points as they finished runners up to Barcelona in LaLiga.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini resumed his career at Malaga, with Mourinho pointedly observing, “If [Madrid] get rid of me, I will go to a big club in the Premier League or Serie A.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, both ended up at big Premier League clubs, with Pellegrini winning the title in 2013-14 at Manchester City before Mourinho’s Chelsea succeeded them as champions the following season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho repeated a wilful mispronunciation of “Mr Pellegrino” when referring to his opposite number, who claimed Chelsea played “like a small team, like Stoke” during a 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium in September 2014.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini has won four and drawn three of the pair’s 14 meetings, prevailing in their most recent encounter when West Ham beat an embattled version of Mourinho’s Manchester United 3-1.</p>
      <p>“Maybe I can think a different way, but he is not my enemy,” Pellegrini told a pre-match news conference on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Everyone has their options to play football in the way they want and say what they want to say. You cannot always be criticising.</p>
      <p>“That’s why he is not my friend, but he is not my enemy. We have different ways of thinking about [everything], that’s the only difference that we have.</p>
      <p>“Maybe [I will have a drink with him]. We have been together a lot of times out of football together. I repeat, he is not my enemy.”</p>

      <p>Pellegrini expressed sympathy for Mauricio Pochettino, whose sacking kicked off a whirlwind 11 hours at Tottenham that concluded with Mourinho’s appointment.</p>
      <p>“Tottenham have a very good team with important players. Being outside of Tottenham, you cannot know what has happened there, but the results were not what Tottenham are used to having,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Now they have a new manager, unfortunately for Pochettino, because I think he was a manager who did very good work in a lot of years in Tottenham.</p>
      <p>“I do not know the reason why he was sacked but now they have another experienced manager in Jose Mourinho, who will always give important things to his teams.</p>
      <p>“[Mourinho] is just in charge of the team for two days so I don’t think he can change too much. They will play in a similar way.</p>
      <p>“That is not an important problem for us to solve, we must give a good performance as a team.”</p>
      <p>Of more pressing concern to Pellegrini is a run of two points from West Ham’s past six Premier League matches since beating Mourinho’s former employers from Old Trafford in September.</p>
      <p>It leaves the Hammers languishing in 16th, a point and two places below Tottenham.</p>
      <p>“I have had 33 years in this profession, I know football,” Pellegrini added. “As I have said, my pressure I put on myself is bigger than any other pressure.”</p>
      <p>West Ham’s midfield could be bolstered by Jack Wilshere and club captain Mark Noble, who trained untroubled this week following respective groin and ankle complaints.</p>
      <p>Forward Michail Antonio might also be in contention after almost three months out with a hamstring injury.</p>
