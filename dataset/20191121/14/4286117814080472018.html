      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Virat Kohli to lead India in both ODIs and T20Is</li>
        <li>Rohit Sharma available for the limited-overs series vs West Indies</li>
        <li>Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar return to the T20I squad</li>
      </ul>
      <p>India's squads for the upcoming limited-overs assignment against West Indies at home were announced on Thursday. Captain Virat Kohli returns to the T20I squad after missing the series against Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, MS Dhoni, who has not played since India's semi-final exit at World Cup 2019, has not found a place in both the T20I and ODI squads even as speculations about his international future are rife.</p>
      <p>India will play 3 T20Is and as many ODIs against West Indies between December 6 and December 22. The 6 limited-over matches will also be India's final assignment of the World Cup year.</p>
      <p>The senior selection committee, headed by MSK Prasad, met in Kolkata a day ahead of the historic pink-ball Test to announce the squads for the West Indies series. This is also likely to be MSK Prasad-led selection committee's final assignment as their contract expires later this month.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami and Kuldeep Yadav make comebacks</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kuldeep Yadav will join forces with his wrist-spin partner Yuzvendra Chahal as the left-arm wrist-spinner returns to the T20I set-up for the 1st time since February 2019. All-rounder Krunal Pandya has been dropped to accomodate Kuldeep Yadav.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Khaleel Ahmed, who had a series of ordinary outings vs Bangladesh, has been dropped. A fit-again Bhuvneshwar Kumar takes his place in the T20I squad. In-form Mohammed Shami also makes a comeback to the T20I squad for the 1st time since the tour of West Indies.</p>
      <p>Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was nursing a hamstring and side strain, is back in the ODI squad as well.</p>

        <b>Rohit available for ODIs and T20Is</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rohit Sharma, who led the team in the T20Is against Bangladesh, was expected to be rested after heavy workload this year but the star batsman has made himself available for both the ODIs and the T20Is.</p>
      <p>Apart from playing T20Is and ODIs, Rohit also grabbed an opportunity to open for India in Tests and made a mark in the 3-match series against South Africa.</p>
      <p>The pressure is mounting on Shikhar Dhawan but the seasoned campaigner has been retained in both the T20I and the ODI squads. He appeared in three ODIs against the West Indies scoring 36 and 2, while the first one was a washout. Against Bangladesh, he returned with 41, 31 and 19 in the three T20Is.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shivam Dube earns maiden ODI call-up</b>
      </p>
      <p>While all-rounder Kedar Jadhav has been retained in the ODI squad, all-rounder Shivam Dube, who impressed in the T20Is against Bangladesh, has earned a maiden ODI call-up.</p>
      <p>Notably, this will be the first time since India's tour of West Indies in August the team will be involved in an ODI assignment.</p>
      <p>
