      <p>Millions of commuters are set to be hit with Christmas misery as rail workers plan to strike for 27 days over the festive period.</p>
      <p>Talks have failed to resolve a long-running dispute over guards on South Western Railway (SWR) trains.</p>
      <p>Workers are now planning to walk out from December 2 until New Year’s Day.</p>
      <p>The only non-strike dates are December 12 – General Election day – and Christmas and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boxing/">Boxing</a> Day, when trains do not usually operate anyway.</p>
      <p>The strike action was ordered by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) and will hit commuters, shoppers and those wanting to see friends and family.</p>
      <p>The union claims that leaving drivers, rather than guards, to open and close train doors is dangerous.</p>
      <p>SWR and the rail watchdog say that driver-only controls are safe.</p>

      <p>It is now drawing up an amended timetable, saying it plans to run more than half of the normal Monday to Friday services.</p>
      <p>They acknowledged the strike would be ‘deeply frustrating for customers.’</p>
      <p>RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ‘RMT has attended discussions under the auspices of Acas for the past two days to discuss the issues in dispute.</p>
      <p>‘No proposals that would enable the development of a resolution to the dispute have been put forward by SWR.</p>
      <p>‘Throughout these talks SWR have not shown any intention of moving the issues at the heart of the dispute forwards, despite verbal assurances in earlier discussions.</p>
      <p>‘It has become increasingly clear that they are not interested in reaching a settlement at this time.</p>
      <p>‘As a result of the company attitude all planned action remains on, and the union is committed to ensuring the safest possible method of operation.</p>
      <p>‘RMT will remain available for discussions with the company at any time.’</p>

      <p>SWR said they remained committed to finding a solution and would be open to more talks with the union.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: ‘We’re very disappointed. Despite promising to keep guards on all our trains and promising that they will have a safety-critical role, the talks broke down today.</p>
      <p>‘We believe these promises deliver on what the RMT has been asking for, so these strikes are unnecessary.</p>
      <p>‘We remain committed to finding a solution that works for our customers and we remain open to talks if the RMT decides to reconsider its position.</p>

      <p>‘In the meantime, our focus has to be on planning and delivering a train service for our customers.’</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously criticised the RMT strike action, saying: ‘Every train which does not run as a result of these unnecessary strikes impacts thousands of passengers at a very busy time when families and friends want to come together.’</p>
