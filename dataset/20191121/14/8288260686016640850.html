      <p>Baileys Red Velvet has hit the UK for first time ever - but only from one retailer.</p>
      <p>Sweet-toothed shoppers will be pleased to hear that Baileys has released a new liqueur that tastes like red velvet cupcakes.</p>
      <p>But you can only buy it online.</p>
      <p>It comes in at £17.99 for a 700ml bottle and has the same alcohol by volume (ABV) content as the original Baileys at 17%.</p>
      <p>Sadly it isn't available to buy in UK supermarkets just yet, but sweet-toothed shoppers can pre-order a bottle of the sweet liqueur at online alcohol store  <a href="https://fave.co/2OuV31q">The Bottle Club</a>  .</p>
      <p>Orders of the Baileys Red Velvet bottles will then be shipped on Friday, December 27th 2019 - just in time for New Year's Eve, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/baileys-launch-red-velvet-uk-20927460">according to the Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>The limited-edition tipple has been created in collaboration with Georgetown Bakery, which say red velvet cupcakes are their best-seller.</p>
