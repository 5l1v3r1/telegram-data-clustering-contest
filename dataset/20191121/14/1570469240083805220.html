      <p>Almost 700 Chinese nationals were arrested in Malaysia when authorities raided a building and busted a major online investment scam operation, immigration officials said Thursday.</p>
      <p>With a fairly open visa regime and relatively developed telecommunications infrastructure, Malaysia has become a hotspot for foreigners looking to set up centres to run online scams.</p>
      <p>Some suspects attacked security officials while others fled as a huge team from the immigration department launched a dramatic early morning raid on the six-storey premises south of the capital Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>Photos from Wednesday's raid showed people standing behind rows of desks mounted with computers, hands held behind their heads, while others sat huddled together on the floor.</p>
      <p>Officials seized more than 8,000 phones and almost 1,000 computersÂ used to run the scam, which targeted victims in China by offering fast profits in return for investments.</p>
      <p>About 100 suspects managed to escape from the building, and officials are trying to track them down.</p>
      <p>Those captured, 603 men and 77 women, had entered Malaysia on a type of visa intended for tourists or visiting friends, but not for work, said immigration chief Khairul Dzaimee Daud.</p>
      <p>Acting on a public tip-off, he said officials conducted surveillance on the building for almost a month before the raid.</p>
