      <p>The night before Candian pot company <b>Cronos</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/cron)-stock-quote/"><b><u>CRON</u></b><u>)</u></a> announced it had received a $1.8 billion investment from Altria in December 2018 Chief Executive <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cronos-ceo-says-altria-investment-is-just-the-beginning-2018-12-07">Mike Gorenstein</a> was so excited that he had trouble sleeping, confessing to MarketWatch that “we can now go and do the things we want to do.” Cronos stock did a lot, then it did the opposite. </p>

      <p>Gorenstein’s optimistic view of the future has yet to materialize for holders of Chron stock, whose price has fallen 35 percent since January.</p>
      <p>While Cronos stock has outperformed rivals such as <b>Aurora Cannabis</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/acb)-stock-quote/"><b><u>ACB)</u></b></a>, which has slumped 52 percent in 2018 and <b>Tilray</b> ( NASDAQ<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/:tlry-stock-quote/"><b><u>:TLRY</u></b></a>), which plunged 72 percent, they have underperformed the S&amp;P 500, which has gained more than 20 percent this year.</p>
      <p>Though CRON stock is currently trading at a 47 percent discount to the median 52-week price target of Wall Street analysts of $9.83, investors should resist the urge to buy this value trap. There are many reasons why I believe this to be the case.</p>
      <h3>A Closer Look at Cronos Stock</h3>
      <p>First, I have concerns about the company’s recent $300 million acquisition of the U.S. Cannabidiol (CBD) company Lord Jones. According to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cronos-paid-300-million-for-a-small-cbd-company-and-ceos-private-equity-firm-stands-to-collect-120-million-of-it-2019-11-04">MarketWatch</a>, CRON paid between 75 to 150 times the company’s 2018 revenue. I know that the CBD market is<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-cbd-market-projected-to-grow-at-107-annual-average-cagr-through-2023-300893763.html"> poised to skyrocket </a>from $5 billion this year to $23.7 billion in 2023, but that valuation is hard to fathom.</p>
      <p>Even more problematic was the fact that a hedge fund founded by Cronos’s CEO and a longtime director stood to collect 40% of the purchase price, including more than $20 million in fees. Though there is no evidence that any laws were broken, this raises many questions about the quality of the corporate governance at CRON, which should concern shareholders.</p>
      <p>The rollout of Canada’s legal weed market also hasn’t gone well. There aren’t enough retail stores in Ontario, the country’s most populous province, among other places.</p>
      <p>Demand also has been lackluster, and inventories are rising. According <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/misgivings-aurora-cannabis-stock-grow/">to Health Canada</a>, the total stock of weed was 48,918 kilograms at the end of June, an increase from 30,746 kilograms.</p>
      <h3>The Illegal Market and Cronos Stock</h3>
      <p>Not surprisingly, prices have plunged. Data from <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/pot-price-in-canada-falls-6-4-per-cent-to-7-37-a-gram-statcan-1.4630721">Statistics Canada</a> shows the average legal cannabis price fell 3.9 percent to $10.65 per gram during the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Prices were $9.75 during the fourth quarter last year. Meanwhile, prices in the illegal market are also on the decline. They averaged $5.59 per gram in the most recent quarter. Given such a huge price disparity, illegal pot dealers aren’t going anywhere. </p>
      <p>Pot stocks are also heavily shorted and move at the slightest provocation. The sector’s move yesterday is a case in point. CRON stock and other pot stocks moved up on optimism that the U.S. Congress would pass a long-overdue law decriminalizing marijuana. Unfortunately, all that happened was a procedural vote called a mark-up.</p>
      <p>Even if the House passed the bill, the Republican-controlled Senate probably wouldn’t take it up during a presidential election that’s going to be the nastiest in recent memory. </p>
