      <p>Accra, Nov. 20, GNA - The Greater Accra Office of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE) on Wednesday held a forum for students of the Accra Technical University to educate them on corruption.</p>
      <p>The forum aimed at exposing the students to the nature of corruption, its causes, effects, and how to help in fighting it. </p>
      <p>It formed part of the Accountability, Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Programme (ARAP) being sponsored by the European Union (EU).</p>
      <p>Mr Ebo Arhin, a Chief Investigator at the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice, at the forum in Accra, said corruption was crippling the economy and hampering development in all spheres of life.</p>
      <p>To end the challenge, he said, there was the need for all to assist by boldly reporting acts of bribery and corruption and people involved in the alleged corrupt acts for investigation and prosecution.</p>
      <p>Mr Arhin counseled citizens to be concerned and expose the ills and fraudulent practices in society that was undermining development and wellbeing of the country.</p>
      <p>He said the state had passed laws and acts including the Whistle Blowers’ Act of 2006, Act 720, to help protect citizens in the fight against corruption and urged the public to be bold to report culprits</p>
      <p>of bribery and corruption.</p>
      <p>He said institutions such as the CHRAJ, Attorney General, Office of the Special Prosecutor, Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO), the Ghana Police Service and the National Media Commission, among others, are mandated to deal with corrupt cases and urged the public to lodge such complaints to them for investigations.   </p>
      <p>Mrs Lucille Hewlett Annan, the Greater Accra Regional Director of the NCCE, took the opportunity to educate the students on the December 17 elections and Referendum.</p>
      <p>She clarified that the Referendum was only to vote on the proposed Amendment to allow political parties to participate in the District Level Elections.</p>
      <p>“The Commission wishes to clarify that the 2019 National Referendum is to enable citizens to vote on the proposed amendment of Article 55(3) of the 1992 Constitution that currently bars political parties from participating in District Level Elections (DLEs), the proposed Amendment is to introduce multi-party participation in the Local Government System in Ghana,” she said.</p>
      <p>Article 55(3) states that: “…Subject to the provisions of this Article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character, and sponsor candidates for elections to any public office other than to District Assemblies or lower local government units”.</p>
      <p>She said that provision could only be amended through a referendum where at least 40 per cent of persons entitled to vote, vote at the referendum and at least 75 per cent of the votes should be in favour of passing the Bill.</p>
      <p>Mrs Annan urged the students to listen to all factions advocating for Yes or No and think about the option that would benefit the nation before voting.</p>
