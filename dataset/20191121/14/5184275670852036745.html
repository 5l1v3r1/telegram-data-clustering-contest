      <p>Indian Idol 11 has stirred a lot of controversies ever since Anu Malik has been reinstated as a judge. For the unversed, Malik was accused of sexual harassment charges by multiple women last year following the #MeToo wave, but despite it all, Sony TV brought back the singer to the show. Now, the National Commission Of Women (NCW) has got involved in the situation and sent a legal notice to the president of the channel.</p>
      <p>A while ago, NCW took to their Twitter and shared a picture of the notice and wrote, “@NCWIndia has taken Suo-motu cognizance of a Twitter post shared by @sonamohapatra wherein its alleged @SonyTV has ignored testimonies of multiple women against a person regarding sexual harassment and made him a Judge for a talent show for youngsters on National television”</p>

      <p>Since quite a few days, Sona Mohapatra one of the accusers had been urging the Industry members along with Union Cabinet Minister for Textiles and Women &amp; Child Development Smriti Irani to look into the situation.
