      <p>Joe “Jowie” Irungu, suspect in the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani has again pleaded with the court to free him on bail.</p>
      <p>Speaking in court on Thursday, the accused person claimed that he has suffered for the past one year that he has been in remand.</p>
      <p>Jowie assured the court that he has no intentions of leaving the country should he be set free as was the second accused, Jacqueline Maribe.</p>
      <p>“My second accused (Jacque Maribe) was granted bail and she never absconded court. I deserve the same,” he said.</p>
      <p>This he said as the murder trial continues. Earlier on in the day, the deceased’s brother George Kimani recounted finding his sister’s lifeless body in the bath tub.</p>

      <p>According to Kimani, he had been in touch with Monica on the night of the murder. She was using her Safaricom number.</p>
      <p>She had asked him to hang up so as to deliver a parcel to an unknown individual. That was the last time they talked.</p>
      <p>The next day, he told the court, their mother tried reaching Monica but all calls went unanswered causing alarm. It is then that he visited the deceased’s Lamuria Gardens home.</p>
      <p>He narrated how the door was locked from inside but the keys were still hanging from the keyhole.</p>
      <p>“We went to the owner of the apartment and explained to her….she did not take long and instructions were given to the caretaker to find a way we could be assisted to access the house.…We decided to take a ladder and the gardener went up through the window,” narrated Kimani.</p>

      <p>“The gardener told us she is in the bathroom. We all ran to the bathroom and found my sister there, dead,” he recounted.</p>
      <p>“Both taps in the kitchen were opened… When we were given the description of the person who was with my sister that is when I thought that could be Jowie,” he told the court.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Government analyst Dr Joseph Kagunda presented in court DNA report indicating the findings from 73 samples taken from the scene of the crime.</p>
      <p>These included buccal swaps from Jowie and ex fiancee Maribe. Others were taken from former suspects Maribe’s neighbour Brian Kassaine and recce squad officer Jennings Orlando Odhiambo.</p>
      <p>According to the report by Dr Kagunda, DNA profile generated from a pillow and a rear seat matched the DNA profile generated from the buccal swab of Jowie.</p>
      <p>Khaki shorts believed to belong to the first accused person were also found with blood stains matching Monica’s DNA.</p>
      <p>The report further linked two “unknown” individuals, a man and a woman, to the crime scene.</p>
