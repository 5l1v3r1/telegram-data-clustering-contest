      <h1>Manchester City man has four-year contract offer from MLS club – Is ‘tempted’ by the idea of the move</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:47:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/sean-lunt/" target="_blank">Sean Lunt</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo could move to the MLS when his deal at the Etihad expires this summer.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old has recently found himself back in the Manchester City first-team as an injury to number one Ederson forced Pep Guardiola to turn to his number two.</p>
      <p>There is little to no chance of him replacing the Brazilian when he is fully fit, though, with the Chilean very-much the backup at the club these days.</p>
      <p>The suggestion has been he will be moving on when his contract expires next summer, and it seems a move to America may be on the cards.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://digital.elmercurio.com/2019/11/21/P/P33MVG9E#zoom=page-width">El Mercurio</a>, Bravo is <i>‘tempted’</i> by the move across the Atlantic Ocean to see out his career and already has three offers to move there.</p>

      <p>The most tempting is from New York City, who just so happen to be owned by the City Group, who have proposed a four-year deal that would see him extend his career beyond his 40th birthday.</p>
      <p>That’s presumably much better than staying at Manchester City, which doesn’t seem to be an option anyway, or becoming a free agent and looking for a move elsewhere.</p>
