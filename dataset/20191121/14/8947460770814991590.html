      <h1>2019 LA Auto Show: Ford Mustang Mach-E — An Electric Mustang SUV?</h1>
      <h2>It seems like all cars in this uber-high-performance luxury car segment are just becoming gigantic, squishy, straight-line bullet trains. They’re all astonishingly quick but lack …</h2>

      <p>Quite possibly the most interesting car at the 2019 <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/21/2019-la-auto-show-land-rover-defender-americas-coolest-new-suv/">LA Auto Show</a>, the new Ford Mustang Mach-E is also one of the important cars here at the show. The all-new Mustang Mach-E shares virtually nothing of importance with the standard Mustang and is, instead, an all-electric crossover with some Mustang bits slapped on it. Yet, despite that oddity, it seems like a very good car.</p>
      <p>Let’s address the elephant in the room first, though: the name. The new Ford Mustang Mach-E would have far more widely accepted if it weren’t named after one of the most iconic cars of all time. Turning the Mustang into an electric crossover not only seems like a bad idea on paper but it also might be a slippery slope. Now that Ford is comfortable slapping Mustang badges on crossovers that aren’t truly Mustangs, I feel like we’re just a few years away from the Mustang name becoming just another trim level. “The All-new Ford Explorer — Mustang Edition”. For now though, the new electric Mustang looks mighty impressive, at least.</p>

      <p>At launch, there will be two battery packs offered, a 75 kWh and a 98 kWh battery. The former should make around 255 hp and 306 lb-ft of torque in rear-wheel drive spec. In dual-motor all-wheel drive, 75 kWh-spec, the Mustang Mach-E will make 332 hp and 417 lb-ft. In top-level dual-motor/98 kWh performance-spec, the new Mach-E will make 459 horsepower and 612 lb-ft of torque. That car can hit 60 mph in under four seconds, so it’s decently quick.</p>
      <p>Ford is claiming ranges of between 210 and 300 miles, depending on the spec. More than that, all new Mustang Mach-E models come with a portable plug-in charger that can replenish 30 miles overnight when plugged into a 120-volt outlet or 80-percent of its battery overnight when using 240-volt.</p>

      <p>Pricing for the Mustang Mach-E ranges from $45,000 to about $62,000, the latter being for the “GT” performance model. At those prices, the new electric ‘Stang seems like a very interesting EV proposition. If you can get over its name, and funky styling, it actually seems like a great EV buy, especially if it feels as sporty as a Mustang should.</p>
