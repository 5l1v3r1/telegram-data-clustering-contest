      <p><a href="https://apnews.com/8aa783ff86a848de9b088ca57715a08d">According to The Associated Press</a>, a judge on Friday sentenced Monica Yvonne Dominguez, of Laredo, to 20 years in prison after she pleaded guilty to abusing a corpse, tampering with evidence and child endangerment. Her husband, Gerardo Zavala-Loredo, received a 14-year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to an evidence-tampering charge.</p>
      <p>Dominguez said her daughter, Rebecka, drowned in the tub Feb. 14 while bathing with another child, according to prosecutors. Dominguez said the children were unsupervised at the time, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Dominguez sought Zavala-Loredo's help to dispose of the girl's remains, which police found in a bucket inside a closet, <a href="https://apnews.com/66694faed5e84b6d8690bb5c73d99a89">the AP reported</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Dominguez, who also pleaded guilty to child injury charges in 2016, was sentenced in April to 10 years in prison for violating the terms of her probation, the <a href="https://www.lmtonline.com/local/crime/article/Mother-of-2-year-old-found-in-bucket-of-acid-13801536.php">Laredo Morning Times</a> reported. The 20-year sentence will begin after she finishes serving her first sentence, <a href="https://apnews.com/8aa783ff86a848de9b088ca57715a08d">according to the AP</a>.</p>
