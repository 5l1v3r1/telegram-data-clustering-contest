      <p>Amid the gloom of economic slowdown with unemployment rates reaching an all time high across the country, the Telangana youngsters have managed to land jobs in well-known firms such as LG, Eureka Forbes, Apollo Group, HDFC.</p>
      <p>Close to 2,000 educated unemployed youth hailing from smaller urban areas have bagged jobs as sales and management trainees, technical assistants, customer service agents, electricians, drivers, plumbers and the likes with salary ranging from ₹8,000 a month to ₹23,000 in six job melas facilitated by Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas (MEPMA) under the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department in the past few months.</p>
      <p>Job melas have so far been conducted in Mahabubnagar, Nizamabad, Nalgonda, Adilabad, Karimanagar and Siddipet with over 26,000 youngsters registering and over 135 firms participating. Employment offer letters were given after interviews and other tests, said senior officials.</p>
      <p>Telangana has one of the highest unemployment rates, especially among youth, as per the two recently-released reports by the National Statistical Office (NSO) of Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementations (MOSPI).</p>
      <p>The senior officials pointed out that as per the quarterly bulletin report of the PLFS, the unemployment rate in Telangana’s urban areas is 12.4%, making it sixth highest among the 22 States surveyed by the NSO. The MEPMA has been precisely attuned to tackle the issue and make the educated unemployed youth ‘employable’ by providing necessary skill upgradation trainings to ensure their placements in reputed organisations or help them become entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>It is a nodal agency for implementation of poverty alleviation programmes under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), a centrally-sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation.</p>
      <p>The TS-MEPMA has created a common application for the youth to easily register and enrol themselves online for the job melas (<i>http://Jobmela.tmepma.in</i>). It also provides a list of companies participating in the recruitment, explained the senior officials.</p>
      <p>A QR code generated online after registration helps in quickening the process, gives them feedback, intimates about the selection and the next course of action. The MEPMA has also launched a unique cloud-based virtual call centre, with toll-free number 040-48210000, to track the effectiveness of the training and recruitment process with follow up calls on those attending the job melas.</p>
      <p>New recruits are monitored monthly for a period of 12 months and the centre also collects feedback from various aspects of the programme. The data thus collected would be analysed for ensuring corrective action and inputs would be shared with the training partners,” the senior officials said.</p>
      <p>When contacted, the MEPMA mission director and Director of Municipal Administration T.K. Sreedevi said the response has been good and the job melas would be conducted in other towns too.</p>
