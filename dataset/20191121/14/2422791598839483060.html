      <p>DETROIT -- Fiat Chrysler is recalling almost 700,000 SUVs worldwide to fix a problem that can cause the engines to stall.</p>
      <p>The recall covers certain 2011 through 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Durangos. Most are in North America.</p>
      <p>The company says silicon deposits on the contact points of fuel pump relays can cut off the electrical current and cause engines to stall or fail to start.</p>
      <p>Fiat Chrysler says it's not aware of any related crashes or injuries. The relays on some of the vehicles were replaced in a previous recall.</p>
      <p>The company is finalizing the repairs and will notify owners when it's time to take their SUVs to dealers.</p>
