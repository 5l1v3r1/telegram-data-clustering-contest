      <p>Tehran: A British-Iranian anthropologist held in Iran for three months has been released on bail, his wife told state news agency IRNA on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Kameel Ahmady was released on Sunday evening on a 500 million (toman, $42,000) bail after three months of temporary detention," IRNA quoted Shafagh Rahmani as saying.</p>
      <p>Iran confirmed Ahmady's arrest in October, less than three months after the detention of Franco-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah was publicised.</p>
      <p>French anthropologist Christian Bromberger wrote in August that Ahmady was "recently arrested", in an article published on the French edition of The Conversation website.</p>
      <p>Author of a book in English titled "In the Name of Tradition: Female Genital Mutilation in Iran", Ahmady holds dual British and Iranian citizenship, according to Bromberger, himself an Iran specialist.</p>
      <p>IRNA said Ahmady had researched and published books on "child marriage, white marriage (unmarried cohabitation), child labour in Tehran as well as identity and ethnicity in Iran."</p>
      <p>Ahmady is subject to a "preliminary investigation" on suspicion of "links to foreign countries and institutes affiliated with foreign (intelligence) services," said judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili in a press conference in October.</p>
      <p>On 15 July, French authorities announced Adelkhah had been arrested in Iran. Esmaili confirmed her arrest the next day.</p>
      <p>A specialist in Shiite Islam, Adelkhah is the research director at the Centre for International Studies and Research at Sciences Po University in Paris.</p>
      <p>Roland Marchal, a colleague of Adelkhah and a researcher at Sciences Po in Paris, was also arrested in June and accused of "collusion against national security", according to his lawyer Saeed Dehghan.</p>
