      </p>
      <p>Former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp has expressed confidence that his former club will finish among the top four teams at the end of the ongoing Premier League season.</p>
      <p>His confidence came after Tottenham chiefs sacked Mauricio Pochettino <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277255-jose-mourinho-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-manager-10-months-losing-man-united-job.html">and appointed</a> Jose Mourinho as the new manager.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have only won three games this term after 12 encounters and they currently occupy 14th position on the standings.</p>
      <p>Mourinho and his new players will face West Ham United in their next game on Saturday, November 23, and a win will be good for Spurs.</p>

      <p>But whether they win on Saturday or lose, Harry Redknapp is optimistic that Tottenham will qualify for next season Champions League.</p>
      <p>He has further placed a bet with <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/arsenal-fc-news-now.html">Arsenal</a> fan Piers Morgan who believes Tottenham would never finish among the top four.</p>
      <p><i>"I've just had a £100 bet with Piers that they will,'' </i>Harry explained at an event hosted by the Mail.</p>
      <p>Morgan responded: <i>"No. It'll be Liverpool to win the league, Manchester City second, Chelsea third and Leicester fourth."</i></p>
