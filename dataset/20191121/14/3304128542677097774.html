      <h1>We Were Misled, Sky News Apologises As It Retracts KQ Stowaway Story</h1>

      <p>British media Sky News has retracted a recent story on a Kenya Airways plane stowaway saying its Africa Correspondent John Sparks was misled.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Thursday evening, the media stated that the report that identified the stowaway who fell from a KQ plane landing gear in London as Paul Manyasi relied on misleading information.</p>
      <p>“This was based on corroborating interviews with people who identified as friends, relatives and colleagues of Paul Manyasi – including his father, ” said Sky News.</p>
      <p>The developments come hours after <i>Nation</i> established that pictures used by Sky News were those of a man identified as Cedric Shivonje, a remandee at Kamiti Prison.</p>
      <p>Sky News had indicated that Paul was an employee of Colnet, a company that offers cleaning services at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA).</p>

      <p>Both Colnet and the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) denied the reports saying no such employee existed on JKIA register.</p>
      <p>Sky News has now apologised to Colnet for claiming that the stowaway was their employee.</p>
      <p>“We no longer have conclusive evidence that he worked for cleaning Company Colnet and we apologise for suggesting that the stowaway was their employee, ” added Sky News.</p>
      <p>The media has since deleted the story on its website and YouTube account.</p>
      <p>In the interview with <i>Nation, </i>Shivonje, charged of defilement, said the photos used in the Sky News story were taken from his Facebook page.</p>

      <p>“I am alive, as you can see,” said Shivonje.</p>
      <p>Shivonje further stated that he is 25-years-old and not 29 as reported by Sky News.</p>
      <p>Shivonje’s father who was in the company of the <i>Nation</i> team had earlier dismissed the reports that his son was dead.</p>
      <p>The man identified as Isaac Betti was filmed in the British media’s story confirming that the bag and the shoes recovered by London’s Metropolitan Police were owned by his son.</p>
      <p>In the <i>Nation</i> story, Betti said the Sky News team gave him Ksh20,000 after the interview. The man couldn’t, however, explain the intention of the journalist when he gave him the money.</p>
