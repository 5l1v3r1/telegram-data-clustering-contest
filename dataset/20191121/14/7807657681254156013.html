      <p>Everyone makes a gaming headset these days, so they're really not hard to find. Thankfully, you also don't have to spend an absolute fortune to pick one up that sounds and feels good. Neither PC nor console gaming has to be expensive.</p>
      <p>When shopping on a budget you still want a quality product, and that's what the Mpow EG3 is. This is a genuinely cheap gaming headset that not only doesn't suck, but is absolutely superb and bests some much more expensive headsets.</p>

      <p>Mpow isn't a Bose, or a Sony, or anything like that, but it is a brand that has generally churned out plenty of very good, very affordable headphones. I've owned a few different pairs covering both earbuds and over ear headphones in recent years and always been impressed, and it starts with the price.</p>
      <p>The same is true of the EG3 gaming headset. It costs just $20, which is frankly absurd for the quality you're getting. Make no mistake, this isn't a fancy-pants, feature packed gaming headset, it's basic, in a sense that you can hear your game and you can talk to your friends. And it has LED lighting, which is <i>super important</i>.</p>
      <p>Build quality is excellent, and the combination of low weight and thick, soft padding makes it a headset you can comfortably wear for hours on end without fatigue. It's trimmed in a leather-like material rather than fabric, which I prefer since it's less irritating in the long term, and the styling is actually quite nice. It's not over the top as a ton of cheap gaming headsets are, with a classy, understated style to it.</p>
      <p>You can use the EG3 with both PC and console over a 3.5mm jack, and while there is a USB connector this is only to power the LED lighting. Nothing is different about using it with PC compared to console, and the quality is the same on both.</p>
      <p>That is to say, this headset sounds <i>great</i>. You get lots of volume, some good bass and a generally crisp sound that would be worthy of something costing much more. You don't have any fancy surround sound, but for $20 there is nothing to complain about there.</p>

      <p>There are some areas of the EG3 that aren't so good, though considering how affordable it is, we're really picking here. The most annoying one is that the exposed metal frame will send a pretty horrid clang through your ears should you catch it. As I have. More than a few times. It doesn't take much, even just resting your head on your chair, and it's honestly the only truly unpleasant aspect of wearing this headset.</p>
      <p>Otherwise we're looking at the old favorite, the non-detachable microphone. Worse is that it doesn't retract either, so it's always there whether you want to use it or not.</p>
      <p>It is also quite a large headset, even if it is lightweight and extremely comfortable. There's no denying it's quite sizeable on your skull.</p>
      <p>It would also be nice to be able to remove the USB connector or have a separate connection entirely since all it does is power the lights. When using it on console it's annoying having a USB hanging around at the bottom of your controller.</p>
      <h3>Should you buy the Mpow EG3gaming headset</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Buying this headset is a no-brainer if you're in the market for something low-cost for PC or console gaming but still want to get a quality product.</p>
      <p>4 out of 5</p>
      <p>That's exactly what you get here. It's $20, it sounds absolutely incredible for something that cheap, it's ridiculously comfortable, looks good and even has some gamer-friendly LED lighting.</p>
      <p>You can spend a lot more and get a worse headset than this.</p>
