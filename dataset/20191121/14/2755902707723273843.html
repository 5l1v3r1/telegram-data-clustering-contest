      <p>Posting on social media she said</p>
      <aside>Zimbabwe is headed for the greater heights. Yesterday I had a wonderful meeting with our President of Zimbabwe. And in that moment I realized he truly wants to see Zimbabwe go to greater heights.<br/>I dream of rebuilding Zimbabwe and turning it into the Dubai of Africa. Rebuilding a country like Zimbabwe requires all Zimbabweans to come together and unite putting aside all partisan politics.<br/>It requires all Zimbabweans to flush out the hate in their systems for the sake of our country.<br/>Zimbabwe used to the bread basket of Africa and we can return this status together as one. I also had the opportunity to meet investors who were preparing themselves to come and build a medical city in the country.<br/>Clearly our President has it all worked out and all he requires right now is for us to give him the support. To those around him sabotaging progress be warned stop turning our country into your money making scheme and start working towards rebuilding the economy of Zimbabwe honestly.<br/>This attitude of power hunger that you have and to the extent of trying to sabotage a man who clearly wants the best for Zimbabwean people STOP IT.<br/>We are ready with our investors to go into Zimbabwe and make the greatest change in Energy projects. Infrastructure! development The best sewer system and water reticulation Agricultural sector and food supply chain.<br/>Our country needs us and let us work together to bring a difference. Hate will eat away at you. So learn to flush out all the hate in your system and cloth yourself with love. We need a Zimbabwe where all our young men and women get into full time employment.<br/>We dont want our children to turn to criminal activities and prostitution, so let us work together and rebuild Zimbabwe to be the bread basket of Africa again.<br/>God bless every Africa and everyone in it. I love you all have a blessed day.<br/>A billion dollar mindset begins with you</aside>
