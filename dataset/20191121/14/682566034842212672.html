      <p>Cape Town - <b>England</b> and <b>Harlequins</b> loosehead prop <b>Joe Marler</b> has given the possibly the strangest interview <b>EVER</b> ahead of the visit of rivals <b>Bath</b> to The Stoop.</p>
      <p>Marler, 29, has a wicked sense of humour - and demonstrated as much when asked to preview Saturday's all-English Pool C Champions Cup clash.</p>
      <p>Marler, who was part of England's squad at the recent Rugby World Cup squad in Japan, not only talked about getting "back on the horse", he talked <b>LIKE</b> a horse - and Irish one at that!</p>
      <p>There's no doubting Marler's, um, 'unbridled' enthusiasm for storytelling, but ahead of the match he'll need to, er, 'rein' it in if Quins are to bounce back from their 53-21 drubbing at the hands of French Top 14 side Clermont Auvergne in last weekend's first round of fixtures.</p>
      <p>Marler, who sat out the Round 1 defeat, offers 68 England Test caps worth of experience and Harlequins will no doubt be happy to have him back in the saddle...</p>
