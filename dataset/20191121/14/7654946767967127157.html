      <p>This guy is no Clark Kent.</p>
      <p>An on-the-lam UK thief “disguised” himself with a pair of black-rimmed glasses — but local cops saw right through his ploy, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>David Springthorpe, 30, who was wanted for a number of shoplifting offenses and breaching a court order, was busted this week “after a chase” when cops spotted the now-bespectacled suspect, authorities posted to Facebook.</p>
      <p>“Springthorpe has recently changed his image by sporting a pair of glasses,” the Derbyshire Constabulary’s Safer Neighborhood Policing Team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlfretonSNormantonPinxtonSomercotesRiddingsSNT/photos/a.461871500974850/728078064354191/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA2gWLHrxVlPhFOhZAImMlHpg6SmXb-7YGOdhbbjHtfvNGoTtjYZkeoKor_i7P4xZc8fUJ1RfU0l0DCJKN-swEYEqhGlbwKf5hJRU8ve1NMHZued3g9rwQ4DlNoUiOzadwISMosQppOkTdvodWYiHZAAQHo9Tr-8GKhLsNUm1iTJaXAu9FZOpKbR6TZyhA219VZIZTbZl5GZbABw6EXA6FZQZ6WlKvmh3kuRZpOz_5yX4MMz43G8kzzTRqRIUAEOnkxPAnZ4kjBy4Ouoc7xyJf8RchtTU_tnIWjiQW9Z-HxW1rbFBxfPEg0GQ95y2YvbRSLqwoW0NUTeD2XrPQKqew&amp;__tn__=-R">posted to Facebook Tuesday</a>. “Fortunately, this was not quite cunning enough to outsmart the team!”</p>
      <p>Commenters mocked Springthorpe’s ill-fated attempt to avoid detection.</p>
      <p>“Yes mate, those glasses completely disguise the fact you’ve got massive ears and a neck tattoo,” Tim Bottomley posted. “He looks exactly the same.”</p>
      <p>“Pleased with the custodial sentence,” Tom Armstrong chimed in. “Doubt it will make much difference though. Unfortunately, it’s in one ear, out the other with people like him.”</p>
      <p>Springthorpe was charged with the theft of several perfume gift sets from Boots, and faces a 30-week jail sentence, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/police-werent-foiled-crooks-disguise-pair-glasses-11188188/">Metro UK reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Back in January, he was fined during a court appearance for allegedly stealing about $26 worth of steak from a Co-op store, according to the report.</p>
