      <p>This quarter has been an especially good one for <b>Bank of America Corporation </b>(NYSE:<b><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/bac-stock-quote/"><b><u>BAC</u></b></a></b>). It’s been so good, in fact, that CEO Brian Moynihan announced the company will be paying employees a special bonus for the third straight year. Employees earning less than $100,000 per year will get a $1,000 check. Those earning more than $100,000 will get company stock.</p>
      <p>Well, we were feeling a little left out, so we decided to get our own “bonus” from BAC is the form of a put-write premium.</p>
      <h3>Earnings Season has Been Good for Financial Stocks</h3>
      <p>Since the big banks started reporting earnings in October, the financial sector, as represented by the <b>Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund </b>(NYSEARCA:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/xlf-stock-quote/"><b><u>XLF</u></b></a>), has been doing well. In the chart below, you can see that XLF has been steadily climbing, and now it has set a new 52-week high.</p>

      <h4>Daily Chart of Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) — Chart Source: TradingView</h4>
      <p>Across the market, the big banks have reported strong earnings. When BAC reported in October, it announced that it had beaten both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue expectations — coming in at $0.56 and $22.8 billion respectively.</p>
      <p>This bullish run has been driven in large part by the company’s strong net-interest-margin revenues and its falling credit-card charge-off rates. The Federal Reserve has helped with net-interest-margin revenues by lowering interest rates. The strong U.S. economy has helped with credit-card charge-offs by giving consumers enough money and stability to pay their credit card bills.</p>
      <h3>BAC Broke Above its Multiyear High</h3>
      <p>BAC broke above shorter-term resistance at $31 after the company reported stellar earnings in October. But it didn’t stop there. The stock kept moving higher, breaking above longer-term resistance at $32 — the high the stock reached in August 2018. Ultimately, BAC finally broke above $33.05, the multiyear high it established on March 12, 2018.</p>

      <p>We think the former resistance level at $32 will act as support going forward, making it a perfect strike price for a put write.</p>
      <p>As always, when picking an expiration date, make sure you balance risk and reward. You want to pick options that offer a good premium, but you don’t want to be in the trade for too long. The longer you are in a trade, the more time there is for the underlying stock to move against you.</p>
