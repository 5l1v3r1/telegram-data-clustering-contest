      <p>This is the hilarious moment Andy Carroll bamboozled Joelinton and left the £40 million man on his backside during a recent <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> training session.</p>
      <p>The Geordie frontman posted the brilliant video on Instagram on Thursday afternoon to his Brazilian team-mate with the caption "Nope Not Today".</p>
      <p>In the short clip during a training exercise, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/andy-carroll">Carroll</a> manages to nick the ball from his fellow forward before creating space with a Cruyff turn.</p>
      <p>Undeterred, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joelinton">Joelinton</a> shows determination to win the ball back for his side - only to be left on his backside when the former Liverpool and West Ham United striker performs another quick turn.</p>

      <p>Carroll nonchalantly then picks out a pass to a team-mate, before checking on the fallen Brazilian and helping him to his feet.</p>
      <p>The clip - which you can watch above - has already racked up more than 11,000 views in a matter of hours, and has caused quite a stir from Carroll's team-mates both past and present.</p>
      <p>Fellow Magpies <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/dwight-gayle">Dwight Gayle</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jetro-willems">Jetro Willems</a> posted "oh my Jesus", while Joelinton responded to Carroll's post with two smiley-face emojis.</p>
      <p>Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian - Carroll's former team-mate at West Ham, posted "TikiTaka big man" to which the striker cheekily responded "you know it mate. I’ve put a few through your legs".</p>
