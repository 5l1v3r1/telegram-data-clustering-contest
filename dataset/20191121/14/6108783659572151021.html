      <h3>Chris Pine and the gang are back.</h3>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/star-trek/">Star Trek 4</a> </i>— or, rather, the fourth film in the <i>Star Trek </i>franchise which stars Chris Pine as Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock — is back on track and will be directed by Noah Hawley (<i>Legion, Fargo</i>).</p>
      <p>The news comes from <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/star-trek-noah-hawley-directing-writing-sequel-jj-abrams-chris-pine-paramount-1202785280/">Deadline Hollywood</a>, which reports that Hawley will write and direct the feature film, producing alongside JJ Abrams and his Bad Robot label. The film was originally to be directed by S.J. Clarkson before she backed out after negotiations with Chris Pine began to crumble.</p>
      <p>The film will seemingly be produced in conjunction with <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/quentin-tarantino-star-trek-movie-confirmed-kelvin-timeline/">another <i>Star Trek</i> film helmed by <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>‘s Quentin Tarantino</a>.</p>
      <p>We’ll have more on <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/star-trek/">the fourth <i>Star Trek </i>Kelvinverse film</a> as news is made available.</p>
