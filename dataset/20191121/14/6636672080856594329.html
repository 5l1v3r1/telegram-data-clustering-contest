        <b>One of Lord Kelvin’s assistants, John Tatlock, tells of how he was walking past the old Andersonian College in Glasgow, the forerunner of the Royal Technical College, when the janitor called to him and asked if he would care to hear Michael Faraday preach on the following day, a Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tatlock thought it was a joke but, next day, he went to the college and, in a back courtyard in a very small hall, he found Faraday talking to two men.</p>
      <p>At the time for his address, there were only a couple of  dozen people gathered in the small hall.</p>
      <p>‘There stood Faraday,” recalled Tatlock, “at a time when the world was ringing with his praise, giving a simple discourse on ‘Brotherly Love’.”</p>
