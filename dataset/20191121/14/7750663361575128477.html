      <p>White joined Leeds during the summer transfer window, and the 22-year-old has not missed a single minute of his loan side's Championship campaign.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-united-watching-leeds-duo-phillips-white_378485.html">it was reported</a> that United were keeping a close eye on the performances of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/brighton-and-hove-albion/"><b>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</b></a> defender having been impressed with his form this term.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Athletic</i>, the Red Devils are firmly in the hunt for the former Southampton youngster, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a>'s side are likely to face competition from Liverpool should they make a move.</p>
      <p>White has only made two first-team appearances for Brighton and spent the second half of the 2018-19 season on loan with Peterborough United in League One.</p>
      <p>United and Liverpool currently have the world's two most expensive centre-backs in their ranks with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/virgil-van-dijk/"><b>Virgil van Dijk</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-maguire/"><b>Harry Maguire</b></a> arriving for £75m and £80m respectively.</p>
