        <li>Low-level <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millionaires-billionaires-living-in-affordable-homes-warren-buffett-mark-zuckerberg-2019-2">millionaires</a> aren’t as rich as you think.</li>
        <li>They may be able to buy <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-luxury-real-estate-not-selling-penthouse-gimmicks-2019-2">penthouses</a> or private school educations, but some things are out of their reach.</li>
        <li>Only the truly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-do-wealthy-millennial-millionaires-live-top-states-2019-10">wealthy</a> can afford things like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/yachts-cost-more-money-than-you-think-2018-7">superyachts</a> and private jets.</li>

      <p>Being a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-countries-with-most-ultra-wealthy-people-ranked-2019-9">millionaire</a> can only get you so far.</p>
      <p>Low-level millionaires might be able to buy a nice penthouse or a private school education, but superyachts and private jets are out of the question. Thanks to an increased cost of living, $1 million, or even a few million, just <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-millionaires-dont-think-they-are-rich-2019-8">isn’t what it used to be</a>. You have to have millions and millions – or billions and billions – to really buy everything you want.</p>
      <p>Even a <i>billion</i> isn’t what it used to be. Consider this: When Forbes started keeping track of the richest Americans in 1982, the richest person in the US, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/forbes-rich-americans-list-1982-versus-today-wealth-trends-2019-11">Daniel Keith Ludwig</a>, had an estimated net worth of $2 billion. Flash forward 37 years to Forbes’ 2019 ranking, and a $2 billion net worth doesn’t even land you a spot on the list. That’s right: The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-americans-getting-richer-forbes-billionaires-list-jeff-bezos-2019-10">richest American in 1982 wouldn’t even make it onto the list of richest Americans today</a>. Instead, each of the 13 people tied for 400th place has a net worth of $2.1 billion.</p>
      <p>Business Insider rounded up five things only the truly wealthy – think multimillionaires and billionaires – can afford, and that are out of reach for mere millionaires.</p>
      <p>You may not be able buy these things, but hey, neither can the low-level millionaire.</p>

      <h3>Superyachts end up costing much more than their multimillion-dollar asking price.</h3>

      <p>Some older yacht models around 80 feet may sell for six figures, but a superyacht will most likely set one back by at least a few million.</p>
      <p>An 84-foot yacht built in 2002 and refitted in 2015, for example, <a href="https://www.fraseryachts.com/en/yacht-for-sale/avicci/">can cost $1.3 million</a>, while a 270-foot yacht built in 2013 <a href="https://www.burgessyachts.com/en/buy-a-yacht/yachts-for-sale/secret-00006961">can cost $132 million</a>.</p>
      <p>But that’s just the beginning. From yacht crew salaries and dockage to fuel and maintenance costs, owners can expect to spend about 10% of the purchase price annually on operating and maintaining a yacht. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-it-costs-to-operate-a-luxury-yacht-2013-3">That’s $1 million a year for a $10 million superyacht</a>, although specific pricing varies.</p>

      <h3>So do private jets, thanks to upkeep costs.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Like yachts, private jets also cost much more than their (already high) purchase price. Jeff Bezos’ Gulfstream G650ER jet cost an estimated $65 million, and Mark Cuban spent $40 million on a Gulfstream V jet back in 1999, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/private-planes-jets-tech-billionaires-2019-3">Business Insider’s Paige Leskin reported</a>.</p>
      <p>But paying for fuel, maintenance, and pilot salaries can total to more than $1 million per year, Chris Battaglia, the director of charter sales at Meridian Aviation at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/teterboro-airport">New Jersey’s Teterboro Airport</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/costs-of-owning-private-jet-not-for-millionaires-2019-11">previously told Business Insider’s Katie Warren</a>. Pilot salaries can add up to $750,000 per year and hangar fees can run around $200,000 per year.</p>
      <p>“Having an airplane is not for millionaires,” Battaglia said. “It’s for guys worth $50, $60, $100 million.”</p>

      <h3>Buying a professional sports team can cost billions.</h3>

      <p>In 2014, Steve Ballmer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-billionaire-sports-team-owners-2018-9">paid $2 billion for the Los Angeles Clippers</a>, nearly four times the team’s perceived value at the time. It’s helped reset the market for what franchises are worth, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/real-value-nba-nfl-mlb-nhl-epl-mls-franchises-teams-2018-7">reported Business Insider’s Cork Gaines</a>.</p>
      <p>Since then, pro sports team sale prices over $1 billion have become more common, he wrote, but relative deals still exist. They’ve sold for anywhere from $25 million to $2.2 billion, depending on the league and franchise.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/nfl-owners-teams-football.html">According to Darren Geeter of CNBC</a>, it can cost over $1 billion to buy an NFL team today.</p>

      <h3>Hiring a full-time staff housing staff can cost over $1 million, not including health benefits and bonuses.</h3>

      <p>Millionaires may be able to hire some help around the house, but they can’t hire all the help. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-people-household-staff-salary-new-york-city-2017-12">Business Insider’s Tanza Loudenback</a> previously spoke with <a href="http://www.hiresociety.com/au-ourteam.php">David Youdovin</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.hiresociety.com/">Hire Society</a>, a recruitment firm that helps high-net-worth individuals and families staff their homes and businesses.</p>
      <p>Youdovin shed some insight on the most common positions wealthy families are looking to hire for, and how much they pay annually. A full-time staff would include a chief of staff, management team, butler, assistant, chef, housekeeper, nanny, tutor, chauffeur, and houseman.</p>
      <p>Depending on level of experience, that could range from $1.03 million to $2.4 million a year – and that’s not including health benefits and bonuses.</p>

      <h3>Doomsday bunkers cost millions of dollars and come with luxury amenities.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>It takes a lot of money to prepare well for the apocalypse.</p>
      <p>Superrich Silicon Valley moguls are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-moguls-8-million-doomsday-bunkers-new-zealand-2018-9">buying millions of dollars’ worth of doomsday bunkers</a> and installing them in New Zealand, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-rich-new-zealand-doomsday-preppers/?srnd=technology-vp">reported Olivia Carville for Bloomberg</a>. The most expensive cost $8 million.</p>
      <p>Companies have been building “billionaire bunkers” that cater to the apocalyptic fears of the superrich, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-moguls-8-million-doomsday-bunkers-new-zealand-2018-9">Business Insider’s Aria Bendix reported</a>. These high-end bunkers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doomsday-prepper-million-dollar-condo-converted-missile-silo-2019-3">can cost nearly $20 million to build</a> and are outfitted with luxury amenities: think swimming pools, movie theaters, gyms, rock climbing walls, dog parks, game rooms, and indoor pools.</p>
      <p>At $20 million, the cost of preparing for the end of the world is out of reach for the low-level millionaire. That means that if doomsday does arrive, billionaires will be in good company: each others’.</p>
