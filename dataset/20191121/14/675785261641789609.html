      <h2>A wildlife photographer was puzzled by the bizarre behaviour of the oryx he photographed as it was killed by a lion in in South Africa's Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park</h2>

      <p>This antelope is believed to have been caught on camera allowing itself to be caught and killed by a lion.</p>
      <p>Astonishing images show the oryx calmly facing a lion as they both share the shade of a tree in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, South Africa, last month, before the big cat effortlessly kills it.</p>
      <p>Johan de Wet says many who see his photos claim the antelope is intentionally killing itself, possibly due to knowing it has a leg injury and won't survive anyway.</p>
      <p>However the 55-year-old photographer himself remains sceptical and is dubious whether animals have the 'capacity to reason like this'.</p>

      <p>The big cat is pictured issuing its deadly attack to the oryx's neck, rapidly subduing the animal in a matter of minutes.</p>
      <p>Johan, from Centurion, South Africa, said: "I decided to take pictures when I realised this was an unusual scene with predator and prey being so close in a standoff. I knew there was going to be action.</p>
      <p>"My initial reaction was that the lion probably had eaten recently and wasn't hungry. It appeared as if the oryx cow realised this and did not feel threatened by sharing the same shade of the tree.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"This rationale did however not make sense as the lion is a predator and will catch its prey out of instinct. So I was puzzled..."</p>
      <p>The father-of-two later posted the images to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> where he stated people theorised the oryx was, in fact, committing suicide due to its life-threatening injury.</p>
      <p>Johan said: "Some have wondered if the oryx knew she was going to die and committed suicide, but I am not sure animals have the capacity to reason like that.</p>

      <p>"Most people reacted with empathy and sympathy for the oryx because of the suffering and violence of the attack.</p>
      <p>"We should, however, guard against attaching human emotions to the situation and appreciate this is nature where survival of the fittest is key.</p>
      <p>"We are human and we tend to attach our human emotions to the event.</p>

      <p>"Others, with a deeper understanding of nature, reacted with a level of amazement at how quick and efficient the kill happened with minimal effort from the lion and minimal suffering from the oryx."</p>
      <p>Johan, who has been photographing wildlife for 7 years, said his timing to capture the sequence was just 'pure luck'.</p>

      <p>Johan said: "I am pleased that I was able to capture the interaction. It is by no means the first or last sequence recording of a lion kill.</p>
      <p>"However, these kills are usually preceded by a stalk, a chase and eventually a takedown.</p>
      <p>"Here, the lion did not need to do any of that. It simply had to wait its chance for the oryx to turn and then pounced with minimal extension of energy. Much like a person walking up and picking an apple off a tree.</p>
      <p>"I am not sure [how the oryx injured its foot]. My theory is that it had probably slipped on the rocks that are cemented in around the waterhole.</p>
      <p>"The surface is uneven and it probably had its leg caught between two rocks when it slipped.</p>
      <p>"[The encounter lasted] no more than five minutes from when the lion attacked until it was all over."</p>
