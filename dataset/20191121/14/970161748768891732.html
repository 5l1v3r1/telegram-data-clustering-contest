      <p>RuPaul’s Drag Race has been a ratings smash, won Emmys and attracted global superstars like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/miley-cyrus/">Miley Cyrus</a>, Ariana Grande and Christina Aguilera as guest judges.</p>
      <p>But despite the show pretty much taking over the world, its host, RuPaul Charles, doesn’t think drag will ever really be mainstream.</p>
      <p>Mama Ru appears on the cover of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/rupaul-cover-story">Vanity Fair’s January 2020 issue</a> – you better werk – and inside the magazine, RuPaul discussed how drag has filtered into the mainstream, but only to a point.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old said: ‘A superficial aspect of drag is mainstream. Like, the “Ooh, girl” or “Hey girlfriend!” or “Yaaas.” That’s mainstream culture.</p>

      <p>‘But true drag really will never be mainstream. Because true drag has to do with seeing that this world is an illusion, and that everything that you say you are and everything it says that you are on your driver’s license, it’s all an illusion.</p>

      <p>‘Most people will never in their lives understand what that is. Because they don’t have the operating system to understand that duality.’</p>
      <p>He then referenced the scene in The Matrix, in which people are living their lives in pods, but dreaming of a different reality.</p>
      <p>The Supermodel singer said: ‘I think most people have the ability to understand that but dare not go there. Because then they would be forced to deconstruct their whole belief system and build another one.</p>

      <p>‘Building a new belief system and then maintaining it is a tall order. A lot of times it means you have to leave your family and friends behind. Because they’re not gonna get it.’</p>
      <p>RuPaul’s Drag Race has had 11 series plus four all-star seasons in the States, and its first UK series has been a huge success.</p>
      <p>Ru herself, plus right-hand woman Michelle Visage, hosted the BBC Three spin-off, with Alan Carr and Graham Norton acting as rotating judges and stars including Jade Thirlwall, Geri Horner and Twiggy gracing the panel.</p>
      <p>The grand finale of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK is on tonight, with The Vivienne, Baga Chipz and Divina Di Campo competing to be named the first UK Drag Race superstar.</p>
