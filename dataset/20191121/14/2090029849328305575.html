      <p>According to the police, female victims had complained bitterly on how Emmanuel lured them to hotel rooms where he subjected them to all sorts of blackmails after sleeping with them.</p>
      <p>However, the suspect said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I came to Lagos few months ago and things were very rough for me. As I could no longer bear hunger.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>I thought on how to survive and the thought of getting some ladies that I would have sex with and blackmail them thereafter.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>I thought of the most vulnerable and I discovered that the best target should be the matured, lonely and single ladies. I opened a Facebook account with the name Dr. Chibuzor, MD/ CEO Health Wellbeing Therapy.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>My efforts paid off as single and matured ladies started accepting my friend’s requests. I started chatting with them, from chatting; the relationship would develop to love and affection.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>When I gain their confidence, I would request to meet with them in any of the three choice hotel that I used. They would honour my invitation, for them to feel that I was a big guy, I would tell them to give me their location where my boy would come and pick them.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>I would go and pick them, pretending to be an errand boy to the big man who invited them. When we arrive the rooms, I would ask them to relax, as my master would soon arrive.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>After some hours, I would come back to the room and inform that my master would no longer be around as an important assignment took him outside Lagos.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>It is at that moment that I would start working on their brains; telling them how I would assist if they would agree to have sex with me.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>They usually agree and after sex, I would demand for money and they willingly give me. I wasn’t using diabolical means. I think they succumbed out of fear or that they needed sex.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Many ladies out there are sex starved. I did not rape them. I have questions for my victims: did any of them raise alarm when I was raping them and why did they not report to the hotel management?”</i>
      </blockquote>
