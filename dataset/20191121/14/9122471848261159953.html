      <h1>Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Ohio State-Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:23:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The best game slated for this weekend in college football will take place in Columbus. On Saturday, the Ohio State Buckeyes will host the Penn State Nittany Lions.</p>
      <p>Penn State could boosts its stock in the College Football Playoff rankings with an upset victory. On the other hand, a loss to Ohio State would derail its chances of making the postseason.</p>
      <p>Regardless of its opponent this season, Ohio State has been so dominant. The defense should receive a boost this Saturday as Chase Young is set to return from his two-game suspension.</p>
      <p>Justin Fields could very well have his Heisman moment this weekend, as a statement win against the Nittany Lions would be quite impressive. Fortunately for the Buckeyes, one of the top college football analysts has them winning in convincing fashion.</p>
      <h3>Ralph D. Russo of the <a href="https://collegefootball.ap.org/article/college-football-picks-scoreboard-watching-cfp-hopefuls">Associated Press</a> has Ohio State winning 35-14 over Penn State.</h3>
      <p>Thatâ€™s a pretty bold prediction from Russo, who made his picks for every marquee matchup in Week 13. It should be noted that Ohio State is actually favored by more than two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 12 p.m. ET from Ohio Stadium.</p>
      <p>Will the Buckeyes keep their undefeated season alive, or will the Nittany Lions pull off the upset?</p>
