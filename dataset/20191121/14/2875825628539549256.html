      <p>Lydia Bright has told that she was admitted into hospital in the first trimester of her pregnancy after she split from boyfriend Lee Cronin.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old former TOWIE star discussed how the breakdown of her relationship that left her "heartbroken and lost" resulted in her suffering from severe sickness - which she believes was down to stress - that meant she had to be hospitalised.</p>
      <p>The Essex native, who is expecting a little girl, revealed the ordeal occurred in the eleventh week of her pregnancy during a Q and A session with her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Lydia was quizzed by a follower: "What has been the toughest part of your pregnancy so far?"</p>

      <p>In response, the single star unveiled how the early stages of her pregnancy were the hardest</p>
      <p>The beauty shared: "The beginning was very hard. I'm so strong now but at 11 weeks I was completely heartbroken and lost. I was so worried that people would judge my situation...</p>
      <p>"Before my announcement shoot hit the shelves I was in hospital with sickness (probably due to the stress of it all)...</p>
      <p>"People are always quick to talk about the negative side of social media and the press, But I truly believe that my strength came from the support I received from strangers."</p>

      <p>Lydia and Lee's love story has been turbulent from the moment sparks flew when they first met at a nightclub in Ibiza in July 2017.</p>
      <p>They split four months after the pair had first started dating but unable to be apart from one another, they rekindled the flames of their romance.</p>
      <p>The exes moved in together in January 2018 and they broke up briefly for three months in January this year.</p>
