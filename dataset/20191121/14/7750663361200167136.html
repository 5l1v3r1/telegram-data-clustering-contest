      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> are reportedly ready to lock horns with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/dinamo-zagreb/"><b>Dinamo Zagreb</b></a> attacker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dani-olmo/"><b>Dani Olmo</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 21-year-old has been in impressive form for Dinamo during the 2019-20 campaign, contributing six goals and six assists in 17 appearances.</p>
      <p>Olmo also scored on his senior debut for Spain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/malta/euro-2020/result/result-santi-cazorla-among-scorers-as-spain-thrash-malta_379151.html">against Malta</a> last week and is being tipped to earn a spot in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/luis-enrique/"><b>Luis Enrique</b></a>'s squad for next summer's European Championships.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lionel-messi/"><b>Lionel Messi</b></a> has <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/transfer-talk/news/messi-wants-barcelona-to-re-sign-olmo_379830.html">reportedly given Barca the green light</a> to re-sign a player who spent seven years in the Spanish club's youth system before seeking pastures new.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Tuttosport</i>, Juve want to bring the versatile attacker to Turin in next summer's transfer window.</p>
      <p>Dinamo are not in a strong position when it comes to negotiations as the attacker's current contract at Stadion Maksimir will expire at the end of next season.</p>
