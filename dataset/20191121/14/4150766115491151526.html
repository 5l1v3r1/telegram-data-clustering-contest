      <p>Cambodian Children’s Fund (CCF) announced on Thursday the reopening of Christopher’s Hope Medical Clinic – its community medical clinic – after undergoing extensive renovation.</p>
      <p>The hospital, which was established in 2009, is Cambodia’s only fully free medical centre treating people of all ages, CCF said.</p>
      <p>Based in Stung Meanchey, the hospital offers healthcare for children, families and community members of some of the most impoverished communities in Cambodia.</p>
      <p>The clinic had provided 33,194 treatments and consultations in 2018. It had also arranged for hospital referrals and shouldered the treatment fees for patients with chronic illnesses.</p>
      <p>CCF founder and executive director Scott Neeson said: “There are few more destructive forces for the poor families around Stung Meanchey than serious or chronic illnesses.</p>
      <p>“A sick parent or child can push a family into debt, break families apart and derail an education.</p>
      <p>“The ability to provide comprehensive, quality medical care and the latest technologies and medicines for the people around the former landfill helps keep families together and children in consistent long-term education.”</p>
      <p>Christopher’s Hope Medical Clinic was named after Christopher Wolf, who died in 2016 at the age of 32 while on a trip to Cambodia with his mother Cammie Rice and stepfather John Rice.</p>
      <p>Both Cammie and John Rice have been long-time supporters of CCF.</p>
      <p>“The generosity and long-term commitment of Cammie and John Rice to CCF and communities here is enormously appreciated and a gift that will change the course of so many lives,” CCF said.</p>
      <p>Christopher’s Hope Medical Clinic is now able to carry out diagnostic tests on-site rather than referring patients to other hospitals, thus saving time and money.</p>
