      <h1>MMA SQUARED: Prospects and Train Wrecks, how have my 2019 predictions gone so far?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Rini</a></address>
      <p>First we have Alexander Volkanovski (seen here retiring Chad Mendes), who is set to challenge Max Holloway for the featherweight title in four weeks at UFC 245. One right, four to go.</p>

      <p>After a stellar 2018 (finishing Carla Esparza and Alexa Grasso) Tatiana Suarez seemed poised for greatness. However, she suffered an injury en route to a lackluster decision win against Nina Ansaroff and Joanna Champion has taken her place. Partial credit?</p>

      <p>Like Suarez, bantamweight Aspen Ladd made headlines smashing through Tonya Evinger and had a banger with Sijara Eubanks to start the year. However she suffered a huge setback, TKO’d by Germaine de Randamie in just 16 seconds. My bad.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Finally, Israel Adesanya. I’m hardly the only person who saw this one coming, but who could have predicted it would be this amazing. Fight of the year (vs Gastelum), performance of the year (vs Whittaker) and late notice headline a card vs Anderson Silva.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68qvbw6QTrEr4u6gaKCxn5-aKeg=/0x0:3181x1639/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3181x1639):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19395622/adesanya.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>So I got two right, one wrong and one asterisk. Last year’s train wreck was Chuck Liddell’s ill-fated trilogy fight with Tito Ortiz. What could it be for 2019? Middleweights moving up?</p>
