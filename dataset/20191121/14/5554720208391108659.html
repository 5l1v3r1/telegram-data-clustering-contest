      <p>Fans loved the cute conversation between Akshay Kumar and Aamir. While some appreciated Aamir’s public appreciation of a film by Akshay, others wondered if Aamir’s tweet had been posted by Taimur Ali Khan.</p>

      <p>Many also suspected the motive behind Aamir praising Akshay’s film adding that whether this was to indirectly thank him in advance for not releasing his next year’s blockbuster <i>Bachchan Pandey </i>at the same time Aamir’s <i>Laal Singh Chaddha</i> hits cinemas.</p>

      <p><i>Laal Singh Chaddha </i>stars Aamir and Kareena in lead roles and is scheduled to be released during Christmas next year. Akshay’s <i>Bachchan Pandey </i>too is scheduled to hit cinemas during the next year’s Christmas. But sources said that Akshay has agreed to change the date of his film’s release to avoid a clash with Aamir’s <i>Laal Singh Chaddha.</i></p>
      <p>Akshay is currently busy with the shooting of <i>Laxmmi Bomb</i> and <i>Sooryavanshi</i>. His next project will be Yash Raj Films’ <i>Prithviraj</i>, to be released during next year’s Diwali.</p>
