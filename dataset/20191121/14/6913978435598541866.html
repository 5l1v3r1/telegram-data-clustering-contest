      <p><b>TEHRAN —</b> Six environmental conservationists accused of "spying" on Iranian military sites have received sentences of up to 10 years in prison, according to state news agency IRNA and Shargh daily.<br/><br/>Sentences "from four to 10 years" have been issued for some of the case's suspects, IRNA quoted judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili as saying.<br/><br/>Mohammad Hossein Aghasi, a lawyer who represents some of the defendants, told Shargh daily that six of the eight have had their sentences handed down.<br/><br/>Aghasi, however, was not present in court as the state has designated its own hand-picked lawyers to represent the defendants.<br/><br/>He told Shargh daily that Niloufar Bayani and Morad Tahbaz had received 10-year sentences, while Taher Ghadirian and Houman Jokar had been given eight years and Amirossein Khaleghi and Sepideh Kashani six years.<br/><br/>"Sam Rajabi and Abdolreza Kouhpayeh's sentences are yet to be announced," he added.<br/><br/>The defendants were among conservationists working with the local environmental group Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation to track endangered species.<br/><br/>They were arrested in early 2018 over allegations of espionage, but four of them were later charged with "corruption on earth" — one of the most severe charges under Iran's law, which would carry the death penalty.<br/><br/>The death row charge was dropped last month, though the defendants still face other security-related charges.<br/><br/>Another environmentalist arrested last year, Kavous Seyed Emami, a 63-year-old renowned university professor with dual Iranian and Canadian citizenship, allegedly committed suicide in prison in February 2018, a fortnight after his arrest.<br/><br/>His widow, Maryam Mombeini, left Iran for Canada last month and was reunited with her two sons after being unable to leave for months, according to Canadian officials.</p>
