        <b>Kylian Mbappe, French sensation, has once again dominated the players' market value list with a staggering value worth of ₤200 million above fellow Paris Saint German star Neymar Jr.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The forward announced his presence into the global stage with a consistent stellar form that made him switch side to Paris-Saint-German in a big money transfer worth £180 million.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old star, who is often tipped as football posterboy after Lionel Messi and <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1274925-cristiano-ronaldo-escape-heavy-fine-insulting-juventus-boss-sarri.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, is impressively justifying his value with over 33 goals in 29 games for the French giants this year alone.</p>
