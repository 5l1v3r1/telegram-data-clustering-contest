      <p>Looking at Mayweather's photo, his scarf is big and will likely be a maxi version but even if we are to assume it is a mini, it means he paid N5m to get.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng </b>reported that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277397-floyd-mayweather-returning-boxing-manny-pacquiao-rematch.html">Mayweather has stated that he is done with boxing </a>and will not be returning to professional fight.</p>
      <p>This comes after the American was tipped for a rematch with Manny Packquiao in the ring.</p>
      <p>But the 42-year-old explained that he is making more money in exhibitions than professional fight.</p>
