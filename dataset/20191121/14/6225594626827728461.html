      <h1>Twitter Now Sends You Push Notifications About Suspicious Logins To Your Account</h1>

        <b>Twitter has announced a new way to keep your account safe and help you stop attempts to hack it: push notifications. </b>
      </p>
      <p>As part of its efforts to keep its users and their accounts safe on its platform, <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1196852132319621120">Twitter announced</a> a new set of alerts that they can follow when there is a login from a new unknown device. In addition to sending an email if it detects a suspicious login from a new device for the first time, Twitter will now <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/account-security-tips#alerts">also send users a push notification</a> within its app as well.</p>
      <p>The new feature will, of course, only be useful if an account hasn’t already been compromised, and they are only sent following new logins through the iOS and Android apps, twitter.com, and the mobile web.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wersm.com/category/twitter">Twitter</a> also notes that if you log in from incognito browsers – or browsers with cookies disabled –  you will actually receive an alert each time.</p>

      <p>Although you won’t receive these via push notification, Twitter will always email you when an email address associated with your account is changed. This will help you regain control of a compromised account if it ever happens.</p>
