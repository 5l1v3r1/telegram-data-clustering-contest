        <b>Meet the Slimbook Pro X 15, a new 15-inch Linux laptop from Spanish hardware company <a href="https://slimbook.es/">Slimbook</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Their new device is powered by an <b>Intel i7-9750H</b> processor (6-core, 4.5GHz turbo boost) with a beefy <b>NVIDIA GTX 1650 Max-Q Turing</b> graphics card and supports unto 32GB RAM ‚Äî a compelling combination that certainly helps to put the ‚Äúpro‚Äù in ‚Äúproformance‚Äù</p>
      <p>Well, it would if ‚Äú<i>proformance</i>‚Äù was an actual word, but you get the idea üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
      <h3>Slimbook Pro X 15: Specs &amp; Price</h3>
      <p>As you‚Äôd expect of a high-end device in 2019 the Slimbook Pro X 15 has two graphics cards. There‚Äôs the dedicated NVIDIA GTK 1650 graphics card and an integrated Intel 630 HD graphics chip.</p>
      <p>Depending on the distro or DE being used, it‚Äôs possible to switch between the two graphics cards using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Optimus">Nvidia Optimus</a> switching tech and a <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/09/nvidia-optimus-linux-switching-applet">really neat applet</a> or tool from the community.</p>

      <p>The Slimbook Pro X 15 touts a high-resolution <b>2k 15.6-inch IPS display </b>(16:9) with thin bezels (0.4 cm) and full 100% sRGB colour coverage. This should make it especially good for graphics designers, photographers and those who work with video.</p>
      <p>A large <b>multi-touch trackpad</b> and full-size <b>backlit keyboard </b>with choice of layout come as standard.</p>
      <p><b>Two webcams</b> are included: one at 720p for video chats; the other a biometric facial detection webcam that (once again depending on distro and DE) can be used to login in to Linux using your face!</p>

      <p>Ports are fairly comprehensive, with ethernet, 3.5mm combo jack, 3 regular USB ports, a single USB Type C port, and HDMI 2.0. There‚Äôs also built-in Wi-Fi (dual band) and Bluetooth 5.</p>
      <p>Weighing 1.5 kg, measuring 1.68 cm thick, and packing in a 12 hour battery ‚Äî which Slimbook say can charge to 80% in just an hour if you use the supplied power cable ‚Äî the Slimbook Pro X 15 is certainly as portable as it is powerful.</p>
      <p>But if there‚Äôs one area this device skimps it‚Äôs memory. The base model ‚Äî i.e. the model you get at the price in the headlines ‚Äî is a meagre 8GB RAM. Even premium Chromebooks come with more than that these days.</p>

      <p>Memory can (thankfully) be expanded up to 32GB at any time, including after purchase. That‚Äôs more than can be said of other ‚Äúpro‚Äù laptops that ship with soldered memory.</p>
      <p>There‚Äôs also a relatively light 250GB SSD in the base model (upgradeable, of course). There‚Äôs room for a second hard-drive too, which can be configured in RAID array if needed.</p>
      <p>Slimbook is using a <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/11/slimbook-new-laptop-apple-campaign">literal apple bashing</a> marketing campaign to promote this laptop, with social media campaigns sporting hashtags like #NoMoreApplesInLinuxConferences.</p>

      <p>With the Pro X 15 Slimbook want to show that there are cheaper alternatives to Apple‚Äôs high-end hardware available for Linux users, ones that are just as powerful (if not more powerful) that Cupertino created computers.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúWe [‚Ä¶] want to meet a demand for 15-inch computers for photo, audio, video or 3D creators;¬†as well as programmers that require compiling or virtualizing various operating systems,‚Äù</i> they <a href="https://slimbook.es/en/noticias-notas-de-prensa-y-reviews/445-pro-x-15">say in their product announcement</a>.</p>
      <p>And add that: <i>‚ÄùWe bring you a great alternative, with extreme lightness and excellent performance;¬†all at the lowest prices in the market compared to laptops of these relationships.‚Äù</i></p>
      <h4>Buy the Slimbook Pro X 15</h4>
      <p>The Slimbook Pro X 15 costs from ‚Ç¨1,199.</p>
      <p>Now, I‚Äôm not going to pretend that it‚Äôs cheap BUT it is really quite competitive when viewed against other laptops in this class, such as the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/21/macbook-pro-16-inch-review-ultimate-apple-laptop/">16-inch Apple MacBook Pro</a> (‚Ç¨2,699) and even the new Dell XPS 15 (‚Ç¨1,725).</p>
