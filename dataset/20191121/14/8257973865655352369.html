      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Garth_Brooks/?tps=1">Garth Brooks</a> appeared on <i><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jimmy_Kimmel/?tps=1">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live</i> to discuss his <i>Legacy Collection</i> coming to vinyl and how he has completed work on his new album titled <i>Fun</i>.</p>
      <p>"<i>Fun</i> was supposed to come out this fall but we were worried that these two were gonna kind of collide with each other," the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy398xnP88c">country star said</a> about <i>Fun</i> competing with <i>The Legacy Collection</i>.</p>
      <p>Brooks then confirmed that <i>Fun </i>was completed but that he is holding onto the album to release it at a different time.</p>
      <p><i>Fun</i> will include Brooks' collaboration with <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Blake_Shelton/?tps=1">Blake Shelton</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2019/06/18/Garth-Brooks-Blake-Shelton-team-up-for-Dive-Bar/9351560868313/?st_rec=3511562599446">"Dive Bar."</a></p>
      <p><i>The Legacy Collection</i>, available now, spans the singer's career and includes a number of his hit albums on vinyl for the first time including <i>No Fences</i>, <i>The Chase</i>, <i>In Pieces</i>, <i>Fresh Horses</i> and <i>Triple Live</i>.</p>
      <p>"Vinyl, man if you would've told me that 10 years ago I would've said you were crazy. That's nuts. I don't know what's next, 8-track tapes maybe," Brooks said about the resurgence of vinyl.</p>
      <p>Brooks won big at the Country Music Association Awards recently, taking home the top prize of <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2019/11/13/Garth-Brooks-Kacey-Musgraves-Luke-Combs-win-big-at-the-CMAs/7431573693111/">Entertainer of the Year</a>.</p>
