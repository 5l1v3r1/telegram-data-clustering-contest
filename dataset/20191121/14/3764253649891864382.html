      <p>This followed alleged vote-buying and high level of violence which were reportedly recorded in the election.</p>
      <p>According to the Situation Room, in a statement sighted by <b>Legit.ng</b>, the Kogi election represents a major dent to Nigeria’s democracy.</p>
      <p>The Situation Room is a coalition of prominent civic groups and one of the accredited observers for the election.</p>
      <p>Clement Nwankwo, the convener of the Situation Room, announced the group’s stance at a press conference in Abuja on Sunday, November 17.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> also reported that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276945-yahaya-bello-rejects-calls-cancellation-kogi-election-knocks-partisan-observers.html">Bello reacted to calls for the cancellation of the results</a> of the election. He alleged that some of the observers that monitored the election were partisan, hence the calls for cancellation of the poll, which he described as free and fair.</p>
