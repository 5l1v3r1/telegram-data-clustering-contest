      <h1>Report: Carlo Ancelotti want to sign Arsenal star on 18-month loan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:04:50+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10391638/arsenal-lucas-torreira-ac-milan-napoli-january-transfer-window-agent/">The Sun has claimed</a> that Napoli manager Carlo Ancelotti wants to raid Arsenal for midfielder Lucas Torreira and bring him to the Serie A side on an 18-month loan – but may face competition from AC Milan.</p>
      <p>Torreira, 23, has become unsettled in north London after Unai Emery changed the Uruguay international’s position – something which has upset Torreira. He has clocked up 65 appearances since his £26million <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44764063">(BBC)</a> move from Sampdoria.</p>
      <p>Despite Granit Xhaka being ostracised after the captaincy saga, Torreira is still unimpressed at Arsenal and it is clear that clubs are looking to sign the midfielder. Now, the latest reports claim Napoli and AC Milan are doing battle for Torreira.</p>
      <p>It is believed both sides want to sign Torreira on loan in January, until the end of the 2020-21 campaign. It is believed any deal would include obligations to buy, if Torreira reaches a certain amount of appearances. He has a contract until June 2023.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – If Torreira is to leave, it must be permanently</h3>
      <p>Italian sides are becoming renowned for their loan-to-buy deals that eventually sees the player forced to move to a team, even if he has not performed well during his temporary spell at said club.</p>
      <p>That is the kind of offer Napoli and Milan want for Torreira but if Arsenal are to sell the pocket-sized dynamo, then they need to do it on a permanent basis and bring in some cash in order to replace him in January.</p>
