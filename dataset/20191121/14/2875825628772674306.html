      <p>The X Factor: Celebrity star Thom Evans was left red-faced on Loose Women on Thursday as he was asked about romance rumours with Nicole Scherzinger.</p>
      <p>Former professional rugby player Thom is in the show band Try Star, while Nicole is a judge on the ITV series.</p>
      <p>It was reported this week that the pair had been on dates together, while neither have confirmed if this is the case.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Loose Women ahead of the next live show, Thom claimed he was too focused on performing and making the final for a romance.</p>
      <p>But he did hint that may change, as he was left flustered by the questioning.</p>

      <p>Jane asked him: "There's been a little extra frisson for you and Nicole I've been reading?"</p>
      <p>His band mates laughed it off, as a flustered Thom said: "Look, I erm... Nicole is lovely and I er...."</p>
      <p>As the audience laughed, he quickly added: "I've been concentrating on the bromance... and I just wanna get to the finals."</p>

      <p>Pal Ben Foden then quipped: "Whatever it takes."</p>
      <p>Jane then asked whether after the show he might pursue a date, to which he hinted he may do just that.</p>
      <p>He said: "Yeah I mean, look, who wouldn't wanna date Nicole? She's lovely."</p>

      <p>The pair met up in London recently with friends and enjoyed dinner and drinks together, a source claimed.</p>
      <p>"Thom is completely Nicole's type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on - he's always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world," the insider told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361248/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-thom-evans/">Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>"He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up, and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.</p>

      <p>"And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner."</p>
      <p>The source added: "They met up with friends, all had drinks, and were laughing and joking the whole night. They looked to be having the time of their lives.</p>
      <p>"They both want to focus on the series for now though, and then see what may or may not progress once the show has wrapped. But Nicole deserves to meet someone lovely and everyone is hopeful this will work out."</p>
