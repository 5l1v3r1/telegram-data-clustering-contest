      <p><b>BRISBANE, Australia —</b> Australia seized the advantage on the opening day of the first Test when they bowled Pakistan out for 240 just before stumps at the Gabba in Brisbane on Thursday.<br/><br/>After the visitors resisted stubbornly in the first session, reaching 57 for no wicket at lunch, pace trio Mitchell Starc (4-52), Josh Hazlewood (2-46) and Pat Cummins (3-60) tore through the Pakistan batting order to put the hosts in charge at the close of play.<br/><br/>Australia seized the initiative after lunch when they took five wickets for just 19 runs, reducing Pakistan from 75 for none to 94 for five.<br/><br/>The pacemen then struck again late in the day, with 16-year-old debutant Naseem Shah just squeezing out Starc's hat-trick ball.<br/><br/>"It was quite a welcome to Test cricket wasn't it?" Hazlewood said.<br/><br/>Hazlewood said the fast bowlers had enjoyed the extra bounce at the Gabba.<br/><br/>"The way we fought back in the second session was perfect," he said.<br/><br/>"We probably bowled too short in the first session, but we got better as the day went on. It was a pretty good comeback I thought."<br/><br/>Pakistan were rescued from complete disaster by Asad Shafiq who played a lone hand, scoring 76 well-made runs.<br/><br/>Shafiq came to the crease with his side 75 for two, then saw Haris Sohail (1) and Babar Azam (1) fall for the addition of only two runs.<br/><br/>But good partnerships of 49 between Shafiq and Mohammed Rizwan, who made 37, and then 84 with Yasir Shah (26) enabled the visitors to achieve a respectable score.<br/><br/>"I knew that if we could build a good partnership it could help the team," Shafiq said.<br/><br/>"We didn't reach the total we wanted but still we got a respectable total and with the bowling unit we've got, we will put up a very good fight."<br/><br/>Rizwan, who was counter-attacking fearlessly, fell controversially with Cummins appearing to have just overstepped the mark, only for TV umpire Michael Gough to give the benefit of the doubt to the bowler.<br/><br/>Yasir batted bravely but when the Australians took the second new ball, Pakistan's resistance was all but over.<br/><br/>The visitors had frustrated the Australian pace attack in the first session, going into lunch at 57-0 with openers Azhar Ali and Shan Masood unbeaten on 28 and 21 respectively.<br/><br/>The pair began to open up after the break with some sparkling attacking shots, but Hazlewood and Cummins at last found their length and began to turn the screws.<br/><br/>The pressure began to tell and with the score on 75 Masood waved at a Cummins delivery outside off stump and edged to Steve Smith at second slip.<br/><br/>Azhar went the next ball when he edged Hazlewood to Joe Burns at first slip, before Sohail and Azam both fell to poor shots.<br/><br/>When Nathan Lyon had Iftikhar Ahmed caught at bat-pad for seven, Pakistan were reeling at 94 for five before Shafiq and Rizwan steadied the ship in the half-hour before tea.<br/><br/>Pakistan earlier won the toss and chose to bat on a hot and humid morning in Brisbane.<br/><br/>Azhar and Masood began cautiously against the Australian pace duo of Starc and Hazlewood, who bowled quickly without really troubling the Pakistan openers.<br/><br/>The visitors crawled to 33 at the first drinks break and took almost two hours to reach 50, bringing up the half-century opening stand with a Masood boundary through square leg in the penultimate over before lunch.<br/><br/><b>Scoreboard<br/><br/>Pakistan (1st innings)</b><br/><br/>Shan Masood c Smith b Cummins 27<br/><br/>Azhar Ali c Burns b Hazlewood 39<br/><br/>Haris Sohail c Paine b Starc 1<br/><br/>Asad Shafiq b Cummins 76<br/><br/>Babar Azam c Burns b Hazlewood 1<br/><br/>Iftikhar Ahmed c Labuschagne b Lyon 7<br/><br/>Mohammad Rizwan c Paine b Cummins 37<br/><br/>Yasir Shah b Starc 26<br/><br/>Shaheen Afridi c Paine b Starc 0<br/><br/>Naseem Shah c and b Starc 7<br/><br/>Imran Khan not out 5<br/><br/>Extras (b4, lb8, nb1, w1) 14<br/><br/>Total (86.2 overs) 240<br/><br/>Fall of wickets: 1-75 (Masood), 2-75 (Azhar), 3-77, (Sohail), 4-78 (Azam), 5-94 (Iftikhar), 6-143 (Rizwan), 7-227 (Yasir), 8-227 (Afridi), 9-227 (Shafiq), 10-240 (Naseem)<br/><br/><b>Bowling:</b> Starc 18.2-52-4 (1w), Hazlewood 20-6-46-2 (1nb), Cummins 22-7-60-3, Lyon 17-3-40-1, Labuschagne 8-0-24-0, Smith 1-0-6-0<br/><br/>Australia: Joe Burns, David Warner, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, Tim Paine (capt), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood. — AFP</p>
