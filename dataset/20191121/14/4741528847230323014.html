      <p><b>Speaking on the Nigerian</b> agricultural sector, the President of LCCI, Babatunde Paul Ruwase, said that the sector attracted $169.37 million foreign direct investment between April and June 2019.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Research conducted locally and internationally confirmed a positive correlation between agriculture finance and agriculture development. Nigeria needs to scale up investments in improving agriculture yield and integrating the value chain over the next decade to effectively capture a significant share of the market.”</i>
