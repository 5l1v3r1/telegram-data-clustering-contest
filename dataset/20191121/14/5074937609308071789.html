      <p>Ho, Nov. 20, GNA - Right Reverend Dr Seth Senyo Agidi, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Evangelical Presbyterian (E.P) Church, Ghana, has called on members of the Church to get closer to one another in unity and the bond of peace in mission and service to the world.</p>
      <p>He said the mission of the Church in propagating the gospel and service to mankind could only be achieved through unity.</p>
      <p>Rt. Rev. Agidi made the call in his anniversary message to mark the Founders’ Day celebration and 172 years anniversary of the Church on the theme; “Improving upon our gains through selflessness, integrity and effective stewardship."</p>
      <p>He said the Church staggered through “thick and thin" to make strides in the propagation of the gospel, establishment of educational institutions, healthcare delivery and other social services as part of its mandate of “bringing light to where there is darkness,"</p>
      <p>Rt. Rev. Agidi said the Church was crafting its story of the future, which would give birth to a host of new narratives for generations to come.</p>
      <p>He said the Church through its Development and Relief Agency run agricultural projects, health facilities, rural community and development projects, street children and micro finance.</p>
      <p>Rt. Rev. Agidi said the Church was also into aged care activities, advocacy on afforestation and ecological justice and reversal of climate change, publishing and hospitality.</p>
      <p>He said the Church had about 549 primary and 157 junior high schools, six senior high schools, three colleges of education and one university college.</p>
      <p>On spiritual development, Rev Dr Agidi said the Church currently had membership of 155,104 in 928 congregations across the country and 371 members in five congregations in the diaspora.</p>
      <p>Rt. Rev. Agidi paid a glowing tribute to the founding fathers of the Church, chiefs and other stakeholders who played vital roles in the growth of the Church.</p>
      <p>The E.P. Church was established on 14th November, 1847 at Peki by the late Rev. Lorenz Wolf, a Missionary of the North German Missionary Society (Bremen Mission).</p>
