      <h1>Nicola Sturgeon wants 'justice done' over Alex Salmond sexual assault and rape charges</h1>
      <h2>The First Minister said it would inappropriate for her to comment on an ongoing trial.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:28:24+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Philip, Peter Davidson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-philip/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/peter-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to see "justice done" in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-alex-salmonds-statement-full-20927579">Alex Salmond</a> court case after he was charged with sexual assault and rape.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-alex-salmonds-statement-full-20927579">First Minister</a>, who appeared at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-alex-salmonds-statement-full-20927579">High Court in Edinburgh</a> today, is accused of 14 sex crimes by 10 different women over a six-year period from 2008 to 2014.</p>
      <p>One of the charges includes an attempted rape of a woman in June 2014, while there are 11 sexual assault charges - including one with intent to rape - and two of indecent assault.</p>
      <p>The current SNP and First Minister said it was a matter for the courts to decide if <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-alex-salmonds-statement-full-20927579">Salmond</a> was guilty or not.</p>

      <p>She said: "This is an ongoing criminal trial and it would just not be appropriate in any way shape or form to make any comment on it while the trial is ongoing and before it reaches a conclusion. <br/><br/>"The only thing I would say, as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-alex-salmonds-statement-full-20927579">First Minister</a> and as an ordinary citizen, is my only interest is in seeing justice done, whatever that may be. That is a matter, of course, for the courts with all due process."</p>
      <p>During his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-alex-salmonds-statement-full-20927579">statement</a> outside court following the preliminary hearing earlier today <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-alex-salmonds-statement-full-20927579">Salmond</a> said he was not going to say anything which would influence the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>Asked if there concerns the case could affect the general election, Sturgeon replied: "No, I don’t but I won’t comment further than that.</p>
      <p>"Anything at all I say about or around this issue has the potential to lead to coverage and headlines that would not be helpful in terms of ensuring due process and a fair trial.</p>
      <p>"I am going to respect the court process here, because that is in the overriding interest of everybody involved."</p>
      <p>Sturgeon had opened up about her personal feelings during discussions at the Book Festival in Edinburgh this summer. <br/><br/>Asked how she felt about the case <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-alex-salmonds-statement-full-20927579">yesterday</a>, she said: “Look, you can probably hazard a guess at that.</p>
      <p>"I, of course, share the same feelings as anyone reading this in the news today. But I am not going to comment further than that because this is an ongoing criminal trial.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The best thing I can do for everybody concerned is to allow that to proceed and to conclude. <br/><br/>"There will come a point where you will have questions and I will be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-alex-salmonds-statement-full-20927579">very willing</a> and very keen to answer all of those questions, but that time, for reasons you understand, is not now."</p>
