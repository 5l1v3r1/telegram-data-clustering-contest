      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a> Police on Thursday detained Hitesh Puri, Principal of high profile <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Delhi">Delhi</a> Public School (DPS) East Ahmedabad to unearth the connection between <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Nithyananda-Ashram">Nithyananda Ashram</a> and the school.</p>
      <p>What now emerges points towards the possibility of self-styled Godman Nithyananda having chosen children as his vehicle in his bid to expand his foot print in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Gujarat">Gujarat</a>.</p>
      <p>The sleaze stained Swami not only opened an <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ashram-onlinecom-ltd/stocks/companyid-10676.cms">Ashram</a> in DPS and carried out their controversial sessions “based on universal extrasensory powers-like blindfold reading” in the school itself, his accomplices also did the same with more than eighty blind children of Blind People’s Association as well.</p>
      <p>However, unconvinced with their practices, the authorities asked them to discontinue after couple of sessions.</p>
      <p>Speaking to ET, BPA Executive Director Nandini Raval said that while the outfit was referred to the association by a donor, the outfit had claimed that they could help the children see with their “third eye”.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>“We allowed them to carry on a couple of sessions under strict supervision and they did some meditation and such things,” Raval said adding that while the sessions did not involve any tantric ritual the outfit was told to stop after couple of sessions. “We didn’t find any scientific basis of their claims nor did the children respond to their manoeuvres. So we really could not take any chances with our children.”</p>
      <p>DPS East Ahmedabad however had no such compunctions as it not only gave land to the Ashram within its own premises, but also held several such sessions conducted by the Ashramites and duly posted the same on social media. “A session on Vedic Education was conducted by a team of students and teachers of Global Nityananda Gurukul. The session was based on universal extrasensory-like blindfold reading-and using it to experience life in a ricer way than we ever thought possible. The session stressed on awakening the third eye. Thus creating what society calls “Super humans”, read a Social Media post dated october 12, 2018.</p>
      <p>While no response was forthcoming from the DPS authorities, the nature of esoteric practices in the ashram remains unclear as the experts ET spoke to maintained that the term “Yogini” is essentially a Tantrik one. “There are too many instance of misrepresentations of Tantrik traditions by the so called godmen to sexually exploit their devotees and one has to be really careful with such people,” maintained a senior academician, who did not want to be named in this story.</p>
      <p>Jagruti Pandya, Chairperson of State Child Welfare Commission told ET that the agencies are still recording the statements of the children rescued from the Ashram. “Once we get all of them together, we shall be in a position to take a clear stand on this,” she added.</p>
