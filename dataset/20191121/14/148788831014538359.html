      <p>Think you already know everything there is to know about <i><b>Avengers: Endgame</b></i>? Think again!</p>
      <p>In a new interview, writers <b>Christopher Markus</b> and <b>Stephen</b> <b>McFeely</b> reveal some <i>Endgame</i> alternate story ideas that didn’t make it into the final cut – including an interdimensional battle in which our heroes face off against versions of themselves.</p>
      <p>If it feels like Markus and McFeely have spent years offering commentary about the back-to-back juggernauts of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, it’s because they have. But there were still a few stones left unturned. In a new discussion with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines">Vanity Fair</a>, the screenwriters spilled even more details about making these two Marvel Studios mega-hits.</p>
      <p>You may have heard about how, during the process of trying to break the stories for these films, the writers hung up baseball-style cards that depicted all of the Marvel characters they had access to. Here’s a brief back-and-forth with them explaining how that worked:</p>
      <blockquote><i>McFeely:</i> On one wall is Movie One, and one wall is Movie Two, and the third wall has baseball cards of all the Marvel characters, and we could move them around …</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <b>VF: Are they actual collectible cards?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>McFeely:</i> They’re all in my dresser. I think I’ll hold onto them for a while.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <b>VF: I mean, are they specially made for this? One of a kinds? Or the kind anyone could buy commercially?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>McFeely:</i> Marvel makes them. Yeah. Some intern in-house makes them. They have a magnet on the back. They get dog-eared and bent and stuff. [Each one] says if we have them or not for this movie. And there was a little rating. We didn’t know how much [money] each actor made, but it had either one dollar sign or up to five dollar signs.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <b>VF: So you would keep in mind how much they cost to be in the movie?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>McFeely:</i> It was sort of just a guideline.</blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>Markus:</i> They would allow us to do anything in anybody’s contract. We’d get to renegotiate it as needed, but it was a fascinating glimpse into the other side.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <b>VF: Was Marvel ever like, “There are too many dollar signs in this scene?”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>Markus:</i> No, it was, “You better damn well have a good story for us!”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>McFeely:</i> You actually try <i>not</i> to leave the five-dollar-signs on the sidelines.</blockquote>
      <p>But even more interesting are the ideas that didn’t make it into the final cut, including an interdimensional confrontation and some major shuffling of Smart Hulk’s storyline:</p>
      <blockquote>Markus: There was a sequence in [<i>Infinity War</i>] where they went into the places in the <i>Doctor Strange</i> universe called the Mindscape and everyone faces themselves. It was great but had absolutely nothing to do with anything.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <b>VF: Faced themselves, as in battled themselves?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>McFeely:</i> Banner meets the Hulk, I think in the arena from <i>Ragnarok</i>. Only one of them was getting out of there, and then that one showed up in Wakanda [in <i>Infinity War</i>] and he had merged. That merging that currently happens in [<i>Endgame</i>] in a diner, and he’s eating a huge stack of pancakes? That initially happened at the end of <i>Infinity War</i>.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <b>VF: How did that alternate version play out?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>McFeely:</i> The Hulk refuses to come out, if you remember, and [in the discarded storyline] they eventually came to a realization or a compromise and he busted out of the Iron Man suit and beats the heck out of this [monster]. That whole Third Act is a march toward losing, and this Hulk scene is a big win, right? It’s a guy solving his problem and being a funny character because now, he’s eloquent. We had to, at the last second, scrap all that, put aside all these scenes that used to have Smart Hulk and then re-shoot the First Act of <i>Endgame</i>, going to Thanos’ country lodge, that used to have the Smart Hulk.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>…</blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>Markus</i>: We wanted everybody to have this enormous journey in the five year jump [after the Thanos snap], and to really see, in sometimes shocking ways, how the loss had affected them. We hadn’t given Banner [a change] because we had transformed him earlier, and he had nowhere to go. And suddenly by needing to take it out of the first movie, it was the perfect thing.</blockquote>
      <p>That’s the first I’m hearing about the Mindscape, and if it was on the board at one point, I have to wonder if it struck Marvel’s <b>Kevin Feige</b> as an idea that may be worth saving for a different project a little later down the line. Based on the title alone, it seems very like we’ll see a face-off like that in <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i>, especially since we know that the reality-altering Scarlet Witch is going to be involved in that film.</p>
