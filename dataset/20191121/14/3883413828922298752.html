        <i>Prince Andrew served in the military for more than two decades (Picture: PA).</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Duke of York has announced he is stepping back from public duties "for the foreseeable future".</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew's decision follows the reaction to his BBC Newsnight interview about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>It means that while he will continue his patronages, he will not publicly appear in support of them.</p>
      <p>The organisations he will stop publicly representing include various military charities.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace has confirmed that as a royal colonel and military veteran he will continue to attend Remembrance Day and Trooping the Colour events, as well as keeping his military titles.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Duke took part in Trooping the Colour for the <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/royals-proud-prince-andrews-trooping-colour-appearance">first time as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards</a>.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has faced growing criticism following a BBC interview about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein who took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Epstein had previously been convicted of a separate sex offence.</p>
      <p>The Duke, meanwhile, has been accused by American woman, Virginia Roberts, of having sex with her when she was 17 years old - an allegation he insists is untrue.</p>
      <p>Five days after the broadcast of the BBC Newsnight interview, the Duke announced he was stepping back from his public role.</p>
      <p>In a statement, he said the Queen had given her permission.</p>

      <p>He added: "My former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>"I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure."</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has supported more than 30 military charities, including as patron of SSVC, the parent charity of Forces TV and BFBS.</p>
