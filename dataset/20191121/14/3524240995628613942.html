        <b>Sunday Aborisade,  Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Senate on Thursday passed the Finance Bill which seeks to amend seven Acts of the National Assembly relating to taxes payable in the country.</p>
      <p>The bill specifically seeks an increment of the value-added tax from five per cent to 7.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>It also seeks an increment in the Companies Income tax,  Customs and excise, Petroleum Profit Tax, Stamp duties,  personal income tax and Capital Income tax.</p>
      <p>The Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, and Senators Ifeanyi Ubah, Gabriel Suswan and Abba Moro, however, raised objections to the bill.</p>
      <p>They said the increment in taxes would further compound the sufferings and pains of Nigerians.</p>
