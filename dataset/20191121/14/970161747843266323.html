      <h1>Who was Mahatma Gandhi, what did he do and what are his best quotes?</h1>

      <p>An organisation called Alliance Against Gandhi Statues are demonstrating today against a planned <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/16/students-want-gandhi-statue-scrapped-in-manchester-because-hes-racist-10930985/">nine-foot statue of Mahatma Gandhi</a> because they claim the peaceful protestor was ‘a racist, misogynist and apologist for fascism’.</p>
      <p>In the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing which killed 22 people in May 2017, an Indian spiritual mission called Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur donated the Gandhi statue to the city.</p>
      <p>Gandhi has become something of a complicated figure in the many years since his death, and it seems that not everyone in Manchester is happy with having a statue of him in their city.</p>
      <h3>Who was Gandhi?</h3>
      <p>Gandhi was born in Porbandar, India, on 2 October 1869.</p>
      <p>His initial career was as a lawyer, but he is respected and beloved by many worldwide to this day for leading a peaceful campaign to end the rule of the British Empire in India.</p>

      <p>The honorific ‘Mahatma’, which is Sanskrit for ‘great-souled’ and ‘venerable’, was first applied to him in 1914.</p>
      <p>In 1948, a year after his country gained independence, Gandhi was assassinated at the age of 78.</p>

      <p>After his wife’s death, Gandhi began to test his celibacy and, in April 1945, he referenced being naked with several ‘women or girls’ as part of these experiments in a letter.</p>
      <p>Last month, an open letter from students planning to protest said that they ‘demand that Manchester City Council reconsider this decision on the basis of Gandhi’s well-documented anti-black racism and complicity in the British Empire’s actions in Africa.</p>
      <p>‘Gandhi referred to Africans as “savages”, “half-heathen Natives”, “uncivilised”, “dirty” and “like animals”, to reference only a few of his comments.</p>
      <p>‘He saw himself as a “fellow-colonist”, theorising Indians as a superior race. Gandhi was a virulent anti-black racist. This statue would not promote peace but instead promote Gandhi’s racist and anti-black ideology, and promote continued violence in Kashmir.’</p>
      <p>On the subject of the protest, Professor Vinita Damodaran, Indian history expert of Sussex University, previously told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7576099/University-Manchester-students-say-statue-Gandhi-scrapped.html">Mail Online</a>: ‘This campaign focuses on Gandhi’s views when he lived in South Africa and ignores everything else.</p>
      <p>‘He moved on to become a very much more humane, much more inclusive person in his later years and he redacted these views.’</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Manchester City Council said: ‘Although we aware that there is some debate about Gandhi’s life, most people in the city will see the statue in the context in which it was intended – to spread a message of peace, love and harmony.’</p>

      <p>‘You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.’</p>
      <p>‘Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.’</p>
      <p>‘Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.’</p>
      <p>‘I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet.’</p>
      <p>‘In a gentle way, you can shake the world.’</p>
