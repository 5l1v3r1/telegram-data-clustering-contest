      <h1>A company is hiring someone to smoke weed for $3,000 a month</h1>

      <p>Every now and then a viral ‘dream job’ pops up offering candidates the chance to travel the world for £££, testing out private jets or something similar.</p>
      <p>There was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/20/dream-job-alert-earn-2k-a-week-staying-in-luxury-homes-10951878/">this one</a>, where people had to house sit their way around the planet, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/13/dream-job-alert-get-paid-to-be-a-bookseller-in-the-maldives-10562893/">this one</a>, where someone was hiring a barefoot bookseller in the Maldives, or our personal favourite: <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/25/2019-could-be-the-year-you-get-a-job-in-a-antarctic-post-office-8282493/">an advert for someone to man a post office in Antarctica.</a></p>
      <p>If none of those tickled you, perhaps you would rather get paid to take smoke large amounts of weed.</p>
      <p>It differs from the usual format in that you won’t be sent anywhere far flung to enjoy your joints.</p>
      <p>That will be done from your own home, presumably – and the company hiring specifies that the person they choose will have to live somewhere the drug is legal.</p>
      <p>We should add that using cannabis can be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/19/smoking-super-strong-weed-makes-people-five-times-more-likely-to-develop-psychosis-8944976/">risky to some people’s mental health</a> and is obviously not legal in the UK.</p>

      <p>If you’re still keen, however, the advert from AmericanMarijuana.org says: ‘We’re looking for someone to review a wide variety of cannabis products to give our readers an honest and reliable insights on various cannabis products.</p>

      <p>‘The applicant will have to write about their honest reviews and opinions of the product in the form of a blog. Moreover, they must also be comfortable in front of the camera since the job includes unboxing videos and explainer videos of how each cannabis product performs and differs from other, more notable products in the category.’</p>
      <p>The job ad says that the successful applicant ‘needs to be physically fit and healthy in general to carry out cannabis product reviews regularly’.</p>
      <p>Whoever gets the gig will be paid up to $3,000 monthly or $36,000 yearly ‘depending on their experience and their capabilities’.</p>
      <p>In addition, they will get free cannabis products ‘sent on a monthly basis to your address for testing’.</p>
      <p>The samples will include everything ranging from weed strains, vapes and edibles to CBD oils.</p>
