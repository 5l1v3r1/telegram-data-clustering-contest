      <p>The Samsung Galaxy A71 leaks in high quality renders<br/>4.2 (83.33%) 6 votes</p>
      <p>In the smartphone world, every important device goes through two moments: that of its presentation and that of its filtering by <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks">OnLeaks</a>. It is impressive how this leaker gets the CAD drawings of almost all important phones. So that he can create high-quality renderings of what its final design will be. A little over a week ago we saw the first renderings of the Samsung Galaxy A51 and today, we have those of the Samsung Galaxy A71, with great detail.</p>
      <p>This year, it has been especially important for Samsungâ€™s mid-range, as the South Korean firm has finally managed to launch devices at reasonable prices and with more than interesting features. Precisely this combination is what has achieved better sales in the mid-range segment despite the big competition. This <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> Galaxy A71 will be your new mid-range large format phone, as we will now see.</p>

      <h3>The Samsung Galaxy A71 will have four rear cameras</h3>
      <p>We could already see this year that the Galaxy A70 shared a great physical resemblance with the Galaxy A50, its main difference being the screen size of both, but the rest of the elements shares the same design: triple rear camera, waterdrop notch, etc. This year the same resemblance is repeated because as we can see in the renderings of the Samsung Galaxy A71, it will have four L-shaped rear cameras, just as we also saw in the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. These cameras are contained in a camera module of a larger size than we would like to see and similar to the one we will have in the Honor V30.</p>

      <p>If you look at the front, we can see a large screen and thin frames in this Samsung Galaxy A71. Again we have the front camera in a screen hole, centered, just as we saw in the Galaxy A51. At the bottom of the phone, we have the USB type C charging port. Alongside with the main speaker and a 3.5 mm headphone jack.</p>
      <p>Since these renders have been made based on the CAD designs of the phone, we already have their exact dimensions. Specifically, they are 163.5 x 76 x 7.9 mm (9.2 if we count the camera module). The screen diagonal is 6.7 inches, so in that sense, we do not see differences from the normal Galaxy A70. This Samsung Galaxy A71 will also have the fingerprint reader integrated into the screen. Because in the back we do not see physical readers and also in the side.</p>
