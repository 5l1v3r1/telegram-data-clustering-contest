      <p>However the details on the ‘Save the date’ photo were not enough to ascertain whether she is truly getting married or not.</p>
      <p>Knowing how most celebrities like to trend on controversies, this could be a total fraud. For all we know, it could be a teaser to a new movie she worked on.</p>
      <p>After suffering from several domestic abuse in her previous relationships, Vicky Zugah has chosen to remain single for a while now. She has said several times that sh’d rather remain single than suffer another physical and emotional abuse from any man.</p>
      <p>Well, we are all curious to find out if she has finally gotten over fears and has decided to settle down. Perhaps after being with wrong men for a long time, she has finally found “Mr Right”. Nonetheless we will keep you posted on any update of this story.</p>
