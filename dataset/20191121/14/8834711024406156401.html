      <p>Volunteer run soup kitchen Ladles of Love will take the festive spirit to disadvantaged school children in Gauteng, with a memorable Christmas event and is calling on 200 volunteers to help make 1,200 kids happy this festive season.</p>
      <p>“This year we have decided to join forces with our oldest sponsors, Doppio Zero and stretch out a helping hand to Gauteng,” says Ladles founder, Danny Diliberto.</p>
      <p>“This year Doppio Zero’s Wishtree Campaign will raise funds so that together we can serve 1,200 school kids a Christmas lunch in two separate schools – at the Zakhele Primary school in Mamelodi on 28 November and at Vulamazibuko Primary school Diepkloof Zone, Soweto on 4 December.”</p>
      <p>Diliberto explains that they are looking for 100 volunteers to help serve at each event at the schools to help them create a memory of a lifetime for the children.</p>
      <p>Regarding volunteering he says: “At Ladles of Love we refer to our work as ‘Seva’, which is a beautiful Sanskrit word that refers to the art of selfless service,” he explains. “When you give of yourself wanting nothing in return you become a Seva warrior.”</p>
      <p>For more details and to book your spot on either 28 November or 4 December please go to <a href="https://web.facebook.com/events/477472216206883/">Https://web.facebook.com/events/477472216206883/</a> or click on the Quicket links, <a href="https://qkt.io/t9ParW">https://qkt.io/t9ParW</a> for Soweto and <a href="https://qkt.io/BRhlMf">https://qkt.io/BRhlMf</a> for Mamelodi</p>
