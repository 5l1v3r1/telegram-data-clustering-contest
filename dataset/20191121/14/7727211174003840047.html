      <h1>Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold drops Kylian Mbappe 2020 hint</h1>
      <h2>The French forward has been linked with a move to Anfield in 2020, and Alexander-Arnold has dropped a hint that he would welcome the striker at Anfield, judging by his FIFA 20 Ultimate Team squad.</h2>

      <p>Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has had a phenomenal 2019/20 campaign for Liverpool so far, helping the Reds climb to the top of the Premier League table, eight points ahead of their nearest rivals Leicester City in the league table.</p>
      <p>The young defender is known for his outstanding technical ability, able to pull of ridiculous passes and crosses from deep positions, which gives <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> 's side a different dimension in attack.</p>
      <p>But it's not just real-life football that Alexander-Arnold enjoys, because he's also reportedly a keen gamer, particularly with the hugely popular football game FIFA 20.</p>
      <p>On FIFA 20 there is a game mode called Ultimate Team in which gamers can create their own custom squads featuring some of the best players in the world, even customising their kits, ball, stadium, manager, tactics and much more.</p>
      <p>And, if you're a professional football player, you are given a turquoise coloured card of yourself, which is 99-rated and has maxed out attributes!</p>
      <p>One lucky gamer on Reddit has claimed to have played against Alexander-Arnold in the Ultimate Team game mode, and his team is very interesting indeed.</p>
      <p>https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/dw0829/just_played_trent_he_is_actually_a_good_player/</p>
      <p>Trent's FUT squad is apparently called 'We Dem Boyz' and is largely dominated by Premier League players.</p>
      <p>It features players like David De Gea, a promo Nicolas Otamendi, Everton full-back Lucas Digne, his Reds teammate Virgil van Dijk, an in-form Fabinho and obviously himself.</p>
      <p>There are also a few Icon players in there, with the likes of Ruud Gullitt, Zinedine Zidane and Johan Cruyff.</p>
      <p>But, one of the most interesting things about his team, apart from him not having Alisson, Andy Robertson, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane or Roberto Firmino, is the fact that he has chosen PSG star Kylian Mbappe to play in his squad, who has been linked with a move to Anfield in 2020.</p>
      <p>It's clear that the Reds star is a big fan of the French striker, so could we see them link up in the future for Liverpool?</p>
