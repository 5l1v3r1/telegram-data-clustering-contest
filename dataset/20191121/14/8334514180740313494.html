      <p>(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc and Snap Inc will partner to develop 5G augmented reality features at the wireless carrier’s labs, the companies said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The No.1 U.S. wireless carrier will also preload the Snapchat app on select 5G phones under the deal.</p>
      <p>Snap’s augmented reality features, including lenses that can overlay effects on pictures, have played a key role in its popularity among users.</p>
      <p>Verizon and its U.S. rivals have embarked on an aggressive marketing push to get more customers to use their 5G networks, a technology that can offer 20-times faster data speeds than 4G long-term evolution (LTE) networks.</p>
