      <h1>2020 Subaru WRX Series.White Is The Ultimate WRX STI</h1>
      <h2>Don't worry, this is the final, final, final, FINAL special edition.</h2>

      <p>Want a rally machine you can drive on the road? You could do a lot worse than a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/subaru/wrx">Subaru WRX</a> – or even better, a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/subaru/wrx-sti">WRX STI</a>. And now Subaru's made them even more tempting with the introduction at the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/tags/2019-la-auto-show">LA Auto Show</a> of the new Series.White.</p>
      <p>As the name implies, the Series.White edition of the WRX and WRX STI come in one paint option only: Ceramic White, to be specific, which contrasts nicely with the matte bronze alloys. But there's much more going on here than just the colorway, as striking as it may be.</p>

      <p>Described as "the highest-performance WRX ever sold in the US," the WRX Series.White is based on the WRX Premium, and comes as a result with a 2.0-liter turbocharged boxer-four delivering 268 horsepower to all four corners through a six-speed manual transmission. It also comes with the Performance Package, including the Ultrasuede-trimmed Recaro seats and Brembo brakes with red calipers, and features black trim. It also introduces new Bilstein dampers with all the bells and whistles. If that's not enough, though, Subaru's also offering the Series.White edition on the more hardcore and potent WRX STI as well.</p>

      <p>The same appearance package applies here too, but with a 2.5-liter version of that same turbo boxer four tuned to deliver 310 horsepower. The WRX STI Series.White also features an adjustable center diff, active torque vectoring, and a Bilstein suspension hooked up to Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber – coupled with heavy-duty steering rack mounts, monoblock Brembo brakes with black-lettered silver calipers. The replacement of the spare tire with a repair kit helps reduce weight, and the interior features black leather and ultrasuede upholstery and a red-stitched steering wheel.</p>
      <p>Only 500 examples of each will be offered, priced at $33,995 and $42,695, respectively, (plus a $900 destination charge).</p>
