      <p>A robbery suspect in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">England</a> thought he could evade authorities <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news">with a new look</a>: a pair of glasses.</p>
      <p>David Springthorpe, 30, was wanted for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft">allegedly shoplifting</a> and violating a court order when he recently came into contact with a police officer in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions">South Normanton</a>. A "short chase" ensued, and he was detained, authorities said.</p>

      <p>Springthorpe - a white man with blue eyes, brown hair, wide ears, and a notable neck tattoo - tried to disguise himself by wearing a pair of black-rimmed glasses. That, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Alfreton Police</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlfretonSNormantonPinxtonSomercotesRiddingsSNT/photos/a.461871500974850/728078064354191/?type=3&amp;theater">wrote on Facebook</a> Tuesday "was not quite cunning enough to outsmart the team!"</p>

      <p>"A pair of glasses not going to disguise that ear," one commenter ridiculed about Springthorpe's look change. "You would think he would've kept an ear out," another user wrote.</p>
