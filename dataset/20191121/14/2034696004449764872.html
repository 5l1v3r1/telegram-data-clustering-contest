      </p>
      <p><i>Black Panther</i> star Chadwick Boseman has said he’s not interested in a spin-off TV series for the superhero movie.</p>
      <p>The film came to the <a href="http://nme.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> last year, with a sequel set to follow in 2022.</p>

      <p>Multiple Marvel TV shows are now being created for the new Disney+ TV series, but Boseman, who plays the title role in the film, doesn’t want to be a part of any potential new show.</p>
      <p>Asked by <i>MTV</i> which Avengers star he’d like to team up with for a new show, Boseman simply replied: “I wouldn’t because I don’t want to do a TV show. I wouldn’t choose one so I can’t answer that.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “I have a whole list of things that I’m excited about and none of those are franchises.” Watch the interview below.</p>

      <p>Boseman is set to return to the title role in Black Panther 2, set for a May 2022 release. Speaking of his hopes for the sequel, he said: “Hopefully we can maintain the foundation that we set and build upon it and expand and explore.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I hope, but I think first you need to maintain the foundation. We built a culture and a world and so you have to make sure that you keep that in place.”</p>
      <p>Marvel Studios casting director Sarah Evans recently revealed that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/marvels-chris-pratt-originally-auditioned-for-the-role-of-captain-america-2567566">Boseman originally auditioned for the role of Drax The Destroyer</a>, before he went on to bag the title role in <i>Black Panther</i>.</p>
