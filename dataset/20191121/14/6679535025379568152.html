      <p>The Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has commenced the procurement of cotton in the district. Farmers are slowly bringing their produce to the procurement centres. They have been advised to bring cotton with moisture content not more than 12 per cent, stating that it would not be purchased by the CCI. For BB variety, an amount of ₹ 5,550 per quintal is being offered as minimum support price followed by ₹ 5,450 for MECH variety. They were also informed that if moisture content is less than 8 per cent the rate would be reduced to ₹ 55.50 per one per cent of moisture content.</p>
      <p>As many as 23 centres were established in the nine agriculture market committee (AMC) limits of Siddipet district for the procurement of cotton, according to K. Nagaraju, Additional Director, Marketing. Farmers were directed to come with pattadar passbook and bank account details. A farmer was sent back at the procurement centre at Toguta when he arrived with a cotton load. He was asked to get the account linked to Aadhaar.</p>
      <p>Cotton was cultivated in 74,085 hectares in Siddipet district and the estimated produce was 2.25 lakh metric tonnes.</p>
      <p>In Sangareddy district cotton was cultivated in about 1.38 lakh hectares, more than any other crop. Officials are estimating that 27 lakh quintals of cotton would arrive in the market. As the first plucking of cotton is still taking place and there will be three pluckings, they are stating that procurement would continue till March, 2020.</p>
      <p>In Medak district, cotton cultivation was taken up in a limited area and the officials are expecting that about six lakh quintals would arrive at procurement centres. “Farmers would take up collecting cotton balls depending on the availability of labour and various other issues. So this would continue till end of February or first week of March, 2019,” said Narender, Additional Director, Marketing, Sangareddy.</p>
