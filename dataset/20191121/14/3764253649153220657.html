      <p>The age of Nigerian singer David Adeleke aka Davido has been a widely contested topic among his fans and supporters, with many often times suggesting that he is older than he claims to be.</p>
      <p>Just recently, the music star marked the occasion of turning 27, and among those that once again steered up the doubt about his real age, is Davido Worldwide Music (DMW) artiste, Peruzzi Vibes.</p>
      <p>In a congratulatory birthday post shared on Instagram, Peruzzi while celebrating his label boss, mentioned that only God knows his real age.</p>
      <p><i>"Happy birthday baddest!!! Na only God know your real real age Thanks for being a good leader &amp; a brother all the way. I dey with you till 6ft. Love you my G ❤️ Long life filled with big moves,"</i> his message read.</p>

The clip shared by Special Spesh captured the moment the celebrant was <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277809-davidos-birthday-special-special-shares-video-of-singe.html">taking a dump in the toilet</a>. From indications, he did not lock the door after he had settled to relieve himself.</p>
