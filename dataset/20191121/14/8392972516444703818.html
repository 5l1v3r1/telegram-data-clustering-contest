      <p>Rochelle Humes filled in for Carol McGiffin on today's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a> after the presenter phoned in sick.</p>
      <p>At the start of Thursday's show, Christine Lampard told viewers that there were just three of them for the meantime as Carol was poorly.</p>
      <p>However, midway through the programme <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> star Rochelle joined the panel and viewers were thrilled.</p>

      <p>Christine told viewers at the beginning of the show: "As you can see it's just the three of us. We are always a foursome."</p>
      <p>Nadia Sawalha said: "I don't think in the whole 20 years [of the show] there's been three of us."</p>
      <p>Christine continued: "Carol, who has been with us all morning, is just not feeling great. I think she's got the bug that is just doing the rounds at the moment."</p>
      <p>Jane Moore said: "You know when you suddenly go all sweaty but you're cold."</p>
      <p>Later in the show, Christine told viewers: "We've managed to scoop up a reserve for poor Carol who's not feeling very well.</p>

      <p>"We've gone and nabbed Rochelle from This Morning. This is the problem when we're all next door to each other."</p>
      <p>Rochelle said: "You've got me out of the school run so I don't mind too much."</p>
      <p>The panel first discussed whether they could drink the same amount of alcohol with their partners.</p>
      <p>When asked how she would be if her husband Marvin Humes gave up drink completely, Rochelle admitted: "I'd like to think it wouldn't really affect me.</p>
      <p>"I do think there is a part of me that would find that hard. I'm not a big drinker by any means but when I'm out I do like that little bit of relief.</p>
