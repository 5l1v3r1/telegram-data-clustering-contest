      <h3>Day one report</h3>
      <p>Rory McIlroy continued his post-Open tear with an opening 64 to lie second after round one of the DP World Tour Championship.</p>
      <p>Since that spectacular failure at Portrush in July, McIlroy has won twice and collected a $10m FedEx Cup bonus, and on Thursday's showing more silverware awaits.</p>
      <p>Victory here can neither take him back to the top of the world rankings nor secure the Race to Dubai, but it's becoming hard to argue against McIlroy being the game's best player in the week which saw Brooks Koepka pull out of the Presidents Cup.</p>
      <p>McIlroy is at one with the Earth Course in Dubai, where he'd already made seven birdies and just one bogey before overpowering the par-five 18th, a gorgeous three-wood to five feet setting up a closing eagle.</p>

      <p>Earlier, Mike Lorenzo-Vera had defied illness to shoot 63, but how long his lead lasts on Friday remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman is yet to win on the European Tour, and it's McIlroy who is clearly the man to beat in pursuit of the biggest winner's cheque in its history.</p>
      <p>Not that this was all about McIlroy.</p>
      <p>Tommy Fleetwood began the tournament with a hole-out eagle, taking his tally to four in 11 holes having dazzled at Sun City last Sunday to end a lengthy wait for silverware.</p>

      <p>A stuttering back-nine saw Fleetwood shoot 65, a number bettered by Jon Rahm as he reached six-under on his return from a seven-week break.</p>
      <p>Rahm and Fleetwood are right in the hunt for Race to Dubai honours, two of the five remaining contenders in the season-long battle, and much may depend on whether McIlroy keeps either of them from lifting this title.</p>
      <p>The current leader is Bernd Wiesberger, who rallied from over-par through 10 holes to shoot a two-under 70, one better than Matthew Fitzpatrick - for whom only victory here will do.</p>
      <p>Shane Lowry is the other in the mix but an opening 73 left him with much to do as the man he overshadowed at Portrush threatened to do likewise here in Dubai.</p>
      <p>"It was great - I started off fast, basically did what I told you I should do starting off," McIlroy said.</p>
      <p>"I birdied the two par-fives on the front nine and did what I needed to do. It was nice to finish the way I did, I hit a lot of quality shots coming in."</p>
      <p>Referring to the way he finished, McIlroy added: "It's possibly the best shot I've hit all year.</p>
      <p>"I had 272 to the front, 291 to the pin; the wind was off the left so it was a nice one for me.</p>
      <p>"I just flushed it. As soon as I hit it I knew it was perfect - it was right out of the middle."</p>
