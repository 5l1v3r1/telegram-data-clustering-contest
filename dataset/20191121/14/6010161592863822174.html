      <p>For this Fortnite challenge, you’ll need to visit and dance at three points of interest around the map.</p>
      <p>You can complete this challenge across three matches or in one if you’re fast enough. Once you’ve found the <b>Pipeman, Hayman</b> and <b>timber tent,</b> do a little dance at them for a few moments until the step registers as complete.</p>
      <p>Keep an eye out for opponents in these locations, so grab a weapon and build a few walls around you before you get started.</p>
      <h3>Dance at the Pipeman, the Hayman and the Timber Tent</h3>
      <p>To find the pipeman, you’ll need to head South of <b>Misty Meadows.</b> You’ll find him chilling on a hill, so use your favourite emote for a few seconds before moving on.</p>
      <p>Next, it’s off to <b>Frenzy Farm</b> to find the Hayman. He’s in the Southwest of the area giving you a big wave. Again, dance in front of him for a moment before setting off to find the timber tent.</p>

      <p>The timber tent can be found Northeast of <b>Holly Hedges</b> and looks like a teepee without any cover on it. There’s a chest inside it, so open it up to grab a weapon then do a wee dance to finish off the challenge.</p>
