      <p>If you plan to purchase a 4K TV this Black Friday or want to upgrade your existing sound system, Best Buy has discounted several Vizio soundbars ahead of next week. To start, you can get the SB46514-F6 for <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-5-1-4-channel-soundbar-system-with-10-wireless-subwoofer-and-dolby-atmos-with-google-assistant-black/6315192.p?skuId=6315192">$700</a>, down from $1000. This 5.1.4-channel system comes with a 10-inch subwoofer and four upward-facing speakers (for Dolby Atmos), as well as support for Google Assistant. You can also stream music to it through WiFi and Bluetooth. Our friends at <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-soundbar/"><i>Wirecutter</i></a> say the SB46514-F6 is "the best soundbar you can find in the $1,000-or-less price range."</p>
      <p>Best Buy has also discounted the SB46312-F6. It's currently <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-3-1-2-channel-soundbar-system-with-10-wireless-subwoofer-and-dolby-atmos-with-google-assistant-black/6315191.p?skuId=6315191">$550</a>, instead of $800. It includes all of the same features as the above model but is a 3.1.2-channel system, instead of a 5.1.4. There are also a couple of options if you're looking for something under $300. First, there's the SB36512-F6, which is a 5.1.2-channel system with a 6-inch subwoofer and Dolby Atmos support. It's currently <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-5-1-2-channel-soundbar-system-with-6-wireless-subwoofer-and-dolby-atmos-black/6288824.p?skuId=6288824">$300</a>, down from its usual price of $500. Then there's the SB36312-G6, which is a 3.1.2-channel system with a 5-inch subwoofer and Dolby Atmos. Best Buy has discounted it by <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-3-1-2-channel-soundbar-system-with-5-wireless-subwoofer-and-dolby-atmos-black-silver/6345760.p?skuId=6345760">$220</a>, making it $250. If you want something for under $200, there's the SB3651-E6 for <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-smartcast-5-1-channel-sound-bar-system-with-5-1-4-wireless-subwoofer-black/5768100.p?skuId=5768100">$150</a>. It's a 5.1 system that has Chromecast support built-in.</p>
      <p>Next up, there's the SB3621N-E8M. It's currently <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-2-1-channel-soundbar-system-with-5-1-4-wireless-subwoofer-black-silver/5767900.p?skuId=5767900">$100</a>, instead of $180. With its five-and-a-quarter-inch driver subwoofer, Vizio says it can output up 100 decibels of sound. Lastly, if all you want is a soundbar without a subwoofer, you can get the SB2020n-G6M for <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-2-0-channel-soundbar-system-black/6344253.p?skuId=6344253">$60</a>, instead of $90. It includes built-in Bluetooth and can emulate a much bigger system with its DTS Virtual:X tech.</p>
