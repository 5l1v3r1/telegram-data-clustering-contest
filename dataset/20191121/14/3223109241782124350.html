      <h1>Stephen Fry, Sir Lenny Henry to Guest Star in ‘Doctor Who’ Season Opener</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:26:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Two days after it <a href="https://twitter.com/bbcdoctorwho/status/1196760031577948160">wrapped filming</a> on <i>Doctor Who</i> season 12, the BBC announced a pair of British TV legends set to make their TARDIS debut.</p>
      <p>Stephen Fry (<i>A Bit of Fry and Laurie</i>, <i>Bones</i>) and Sir Lenny Henry CBE (<i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>) <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2019/11/doctor-who-casting-news-stephen-fry-and-sir-lenny-henry-cbe-to-appear-in-new-season">will guest star</a> in the series opener—whenever that may be.</p>
      <p>“Short of being picked for a British space exploration program, and I readily concede that I’m past the age where I’d be considered (if I was ever the right age for such a posting), then being in an episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> will certainly do as a very sweet second-place excitement,” the 62-year-old comedian said.</p>
      <p>Considering the long-running sci-fi drama is basically the <i>Law &amp; Order</i> of the U.K.—i.e. anyone who’s anyone has made at least one appearance—it’s hard to believe Fry never cameoed.</p>
      <p>U.S. viewers may recognize him as Dr. Gordon Wyatt on <i>Bones</i> or Gordon Deitrich in <i>V for Vendetta</i>. Or, though disappointingly not named Gordon, as himself in the travel series <i>Stephen Fry in America</i>. He was also the host of BBC quiz show <i>QI</i> for 13 years.</p>
      <p>Sir Lenny, on the other hand, is likely less familiar to non-anglophiles, despite his 40-plus years on the stage and screen.</p>
      <p>Aside from playing Knight Bus’s shrunken head accessory in the third Harry Potter film, Henry is known for his comedy, starring in programs like <i>The Lenny Henry Show</i>, <i>Lenny Goes to Town</i>, and <i>Chef!</i></p>

      <p>He showed off his dramatic chops in the third season of <i>Broadchurch</i>, alongside the Thirteenth Doctor herself, Jodie Whittaker.</p>
      <p>“It was absolutely brilliant to be welcomed into the fantastical world of <i>Doctor Who</i>,” Henry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The nearest I have been to the TARDIS was when I played the Caribbean Doctor in <i>The Lenny Henry Show</i>,” he continued. “So as a life-long (hiding-behind-the-sofa type) <i>Doctor Who</i> fan, this is a very special moment for me.”</p>
      <p>A release date for the new series has not yet been announced (though <a href="http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/rumour-no-xmas-day-special-series-12-begins-new-years-day-91211.htm">rumor has it</a> the show will return on New Year’s Day to kick off its 10-episode run).</p>
      <p>Keep an eye on the BBC this Saturday for <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/doctor-who-teaser-hints-at-november-return-1809998/">a big announcement</a>.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster last week unveiled an exciting lineup of directors and writers, <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/doctor-who-season-12-writers-directors-revealed-1810511/">announcing</a> a host of new and returning faces—featuring showrunner Chris Chibnall, who has reportedly penned four episodes (including the season’s first).</p>
      <p>“One of the great joys of <i>Doctor Who</i> is getting to work with actors from your wishlist,” according to Chibnall, who counts Fry and Henry among his “absolute favorite actors.”</p>
      <p>“And to be able to bring them into <i>Doctor Who</i>, in one of our biggest-ever stories to kick off the new series, is an absolute thrill,” he added.</p>
