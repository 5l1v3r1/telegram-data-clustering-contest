      <h1>Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show Is Officially Cancelled</h1>

      <p>The Victoria’s Secret Angels won’t be flying down the runway this holiday season.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/21/victorias-secret-fashion-show-2019-cancelled/"><i>Forbes</i></a> reports, L Brands — corporate owner of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie brand — has announced there will be no Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show for the first time since 1995 when the show held its first edition.</p>
      <p>According to L Brands, the decision to scrap this year’s show is part of a larger corporate strategy to “evolve the messaging of [the company].”</p>

      <p>The announcement came during the company’s recent earnings call. “We will be communicating to customers, but nothing similar in magnitude to the fashion show,” said L Brands CFO Stuart Burgdoerfer, while the company’s quarterly report showed a 7 per-cent drop in sales for the brand.</p>
      <p>L Brands’ decision comes as no surprise given the dismal ratings for last year’s show. As <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/12/04/victorias-secret-fashion-show-hits-lowest-ratings-ever/2206470002/"><i>USA Today </i></a>reported at the time, viewership of the 2018 edition of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show was the lowest ever, with just 3.27 million viewers tuning in.</p>

      <p>While Burgdoerfer praised the show for being a “remarkable marketing achievement,” he added that the show itself didn’t represent any demonstrable increase in sales for the company.</p>
      <p>“As timing over the years shifted over the years in terms of the airing the fashion show, did we see specific material impact in terms of a short-term sales response to the airing of the fashion show?” he said. “As a general matter, the answer to that question is no.”</p>
