      <p>In a bid to address the environmental damage and health hazards caused by plastic litter in the State, the government has decided to impose a ban on the production, sale and storage of single-use plastic from January 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>The State Cabinet here on Thursday resolved to ban plastic carry bags (irrespective of thickness), plastic sheets, cooling film and plastic plates and cups. The ban also covers goods made of thermocol and styrofoam, disposable plastic cups, plates, spoons, forks, straws, dishes, stirrer, plastic-coated paper cups, plates, bowls, non-woven bags, plastic flags and bunting, water pouches, juice packets, PET bottles (below 300 ml), plastic garbage bags, PVC flex materials and plastic packets.</p>
      <p>Violation of the ban will invite stern action under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. District Collectors, Subdivisional Magistrates, officials deputed by the Pollution Control Board, secretaries of local bodies and officials appointed by the Central government under the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) are empowered to take action. Plastic manufacturers and wholesale and retail traders will face a penalty of ₹10,000 for the first offence and ₹25,000 for the second offence. Further violation will invite a fine of ₹50,000 and cancellation of the operating licence for the plant.</p>
      <h3>Exemptions</h3>
      <p>The Kerala State Beverages Corporation, Kerafed, Milma and Kerala Water Authority will be liable to collect plastic bottles and covers in which their products are sold and refund the customer under the Extended Producers Responsibility Plan.</p>
      <p>The government has decided to set apart 5% of the land allotted to industrial parks for waste treatment and recycling under the solid waste management rules of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The provision would be strictly enforced.</p>
