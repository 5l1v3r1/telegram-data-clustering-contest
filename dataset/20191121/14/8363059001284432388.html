      <h1>"Climate Emergency" is 2019's Oxford Dictionaries Word/Words of the Year</h1>

      <p>The managers of the Oxford English Dictionary brand have their eyes on a retweet from Greta Thunberg this week, as they've declared "Climate Emergency" as 2019's hottest new, dictionary-bound term. The poor old OED had its thunder somewhat stolen by rival dictionary provider Collins last week, though, when <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/thanks-greta-climate-strike-is-a-word-of-the-year/">climate strike won admission</a> to its lists of words. Basically, adjust your SEO practices to involve the word climate ASAP and you're on to a winner.</p>
      <p>The OED's word experts cite a "demonstrable escalation" in the coupling of the words climate and emergency this year, as more people are pairing the two in their searches instead of looking up older, softer terms like climate change or the positively inviting archaic term global warming, from back when we thought putting in more efficient light bulbs was all we had to do for mankind to make it out of this epoch alive. In fact, use of the term climate emergency was found to have risen over 100-fold year on year, making our modern climate emergency the most searched for form of emergency of all.</p>
      <p>Which is understandable, as it's all unfolding relatively slowly and when there's a proper emergency-emergency involving, say, a school bus dangling perilously off a bridge, most people are aware enough that putting "bus bridge emergency" into Google on their phone isn't the best way of addressing the issue. [<a href="https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2019">Oxford Dictionaries</a> via <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/21/oxford-dictionaries-declares-climate-emergency-the-word-of-2019">Guardian</a>]</p>
