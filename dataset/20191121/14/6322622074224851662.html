      <p>PUTRAJAYA (Nov 21): Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today it is up to him to decide on the changes when it comes to a Cabinet reshuffle, including which Minister should be dropped.</p>
      <p>Anyone is free to express his or her opinion on the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle, he said when met after having officiated at the soft launch of the Kuala Lumpur Summit 2019 here.</p>
      <p>"People can express their own opinion but I will decide if it is agreed to by the five parties forming the coalition," he said when responding to a question.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Dr Mahathir hinted at the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle in the wake of the defeat of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) in the Tanjung Piai Parliamentary by-election last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir, who is also PH chairman and Bersatu chairman, had said that the decision on the matter “would not be made today or tomorrow”.</p>
