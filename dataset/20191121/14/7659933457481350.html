      <p>Lebanon's dollar bonds rallied Thursday after parliament looked set to resume next week and US President Donald Trump said Washington was ready to work with a new Lebanese government.<br/><br/>Several Lebanese bonds made their biggest daily gains since early November. <br/><br/>The 2032 and 2030 issues both rose by 1.4 cents to 44 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb data, Reuters reported.<br/><br/>Bonds prices fell to record lows in recent weeks as anti-government protests brought the country to a political standstill following Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's resignation Oct. 29. <br/><br/>Parliament has not sat in two months, and a session was postponed Tuesday due to protests.<br/><br/>However, parliament's speaker said Thursday that a session would take place next Wednesday.<br/><br/>Some financial market observers have said the record low bond prices indicate the country may have to default on or restructure some of its debt.<br/><br/>"The problem in Lebanon is reaching consensus and the political class reaching consensus and doing the right thing. Until you get the political class swept away and a new one comes into power I don't see an end game yet," said Richard House, chief investment officer, emerging market debt, at Allianz Global Investors.<br/><br/>The parliament session called by Speaker Nabih Berri is crucial to discuss draft legislation on banking secrecy and returning stolen state funds.<br/><br/>According to Reuters, the market also benefited after Trump told Lebanese President Michael Aoun in a cable that the United States would work with a new Lebanese government that responds to the needs of its people.</p>
