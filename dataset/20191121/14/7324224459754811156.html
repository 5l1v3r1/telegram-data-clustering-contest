      <p>Workers at 12 Scottish universities are to go on strike for eight days amid rows over pensions plus pay and working conditions.</p>
      <p>University College Union members will take to the picket lines on Monday after no agreement was reached with academic institution representatives.</p>
      <p>The disputes centre on changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), with the union claiming there has been a failure to make improvements on pay, equality, casualisation and workloads.</p>
      <p>Mary Senior, UCU’s Scotland official, said: “Strike action is always the last resort but universities’ refusal to deal with the key issues of increased pension costs, pay and working conditions leave no alternative.</p>
      <p>“It is unbelievable that universities have not done more to work with us to try and find a way to resolve these disputes</p>
      <p>“We’re asking students to call on university principals to get their representatives back to negotiating table for serious talks.”</p>
      <p>The Scottish members will be joining those from another 48 universities across the rest of the UK.</p>
      <p>Across Scotland, 78% of UCU members polled voted for strikes over changes to USS pensions and 73% backed strikes over pay and conditions.</p>
      <p>As well as eight strike days, union members will begin “action short of a strike” from Monday.</p>
      <p>This involves things like working strictly to contract, not covering for absent colleagues and refusing to reschedule lectures lost to strike action.</p>
      <p>There will also be a rally on Monday starting at 1pm in Bristo Square, Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>The universities affected are Heriot-Watt University; the University of Aberdeen; the University of Dundee; the University of Stirling; the University of Edinburgh; the University of Glasgow; the University of St Andrews; the University of Strathclyde; Glasgow Caledonian University; Glasgow School of Art, Queen Margaret University, and the Scottish Association for Marine Science.</p>
