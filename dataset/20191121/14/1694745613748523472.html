      <h1>Watch a Woman's Touching Reunion With the Koala She Saved From a Bushfire in Australia</h1>

      <p>A touching story has emerged out of the devastating bushfires sweeping through New South Wales, Australia. Toni Doherty was driving when she saw a koala heading toward the flames. Despite the risk it posed to her own safety, Doherty stopped to rescue the squealing koala, wrapping him in her own shirt and dousing him in water.</p>
      <p>Doherty said the good deed was done out of "natural instinct." She added, "I knew if we didn't get him down from the tree, then he would've been up there amongst the flames."</p>
      <p>After being transported to the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, the koala was treated for burns on his nose, hands, and feet, and under his arms. In a segment by Nine News, Doherty was reunited with the koala, who's been named Lewis, after one of her grandchildren. The hospital's director, Cheyne Flanagan, expressed gratitude for Doherty's rescue mission: "The woman's a legend. Just a legend. No other word for it."</p>
