      <p>(CNN) - Megan Thee Stallion had a "Hot Girl Summer" but according to her, it did not include Tristan Thompson.</p>
      <p>The rapper is denying speculation that she's involved with Thompson, who plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers and shares a daughter with Khlo√© Kardashian.</p>
      <p>It all apparently started with a report that Thompson invited Stallion to a Knicks vs. Cavaliers game at Madison Square Garden in New York City.</p>
      <p>While she retweeted the New York Knicks tweet about her being present at MSG, she responded to another tweet which featured an article claiming she and Thompson were dating.</p>
      <p>"Lol they literally made up a whole LIE," she tweeted. "I was at knicks game with my manager and my friend Ej."</p>
      <p>In another tweet, she <a href="https://twitter.com/theestallion/status/1197203271817007106?s=20">rather graphically stated </a>that she doesn't even know Thompson.</p>
      <p>She also got a final word in.</p>
      <p>"If I ain't claiming him he ain't mine ...SIMPLE," the rapper tweeted.</p>
      <p>Megan Thee Stallion is currently one of the hottest rappers in the industry, despite her not being one of the freshman artists recognized recently by the Grammys.</p>
      <p>Thompson made headlines in April 2018 when he became embroiled in a cheating scandal while Kardashian was pregnant with their daughter, True.</p>
      <p>The couple split soon after and the drama was documented on her family's hit reality series "Keeping Up with the Kardashians."</p>
