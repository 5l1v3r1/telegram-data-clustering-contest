      <p>Waterloo Brewing has disclosed that it faced what is it calling a “<a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/waterloo-brewing-identifies-cyberattack-800011316.html">social engineering cyberattack</a>” that has cost it $2.1 million CAD.</p>
      <p>The Kitchener-based brewery says that the cyberattack happened in early November. It involved creditor employee impersonation and fraudulent wire transfer requests by a third-party.</p>
      <p>Waterloo Brewing says that it recently became aware of the incident and that it has initiated an analysis of all other transaction activity across all of its bank accounts.</p>
      <p>At this time, the brewery does not believe that its systems were breached or that any personal information of its customers is at risk.</p>
      <p>The company has not been able to recover any of the money that was wired to the fraudulent third-party account, but is working to get it back.</p>
      <p>Waterloo Brewing is working with authorities and local police services and is conducting an internal investigation.</p>
