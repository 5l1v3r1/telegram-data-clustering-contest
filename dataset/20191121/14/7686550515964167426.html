      <h1>Steve Cooper drops hint over Swansea City's January plans as transfer links emerge</h1>
      <h2>The Swans boss has been speaking about the club's possible January plans</h2>

      <p>Swansea City boss Steve Cooper says the club will not bring in players for the sake of it in January, and insists the club do not need to sell their brightest names to balance the books.</p>
      <p>The Swans have already been linked with several names in recent weeks, including Celtic star <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/swansea-city-battle-stoke-city-17280576">Jonny Hayes and Livingston's Lyndon Dykes</a> , although it's understood that those links are wide of the mark.</p>
      <p>And today the Scottish Sun linked Swansea with former Rangers youngster Owen McGinty.</p>
      <p>Swansea head into Saturday's clash with Millwall looking to extend their unbeaten run to four Championship games, ahead of what will prove to be a busy winter schedule.</p>
      <p>Rumours and speculation are likely to persist as the January window approaches, but Cooper insists the club won't be pressured into bringing players on board.</p>
      <p>"We've got lots of players. I'm not sure we really want that many more because otherwise you end up with too many," <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-cooper-swansea-city-transfers-17292235">he said</a> .</p>
      <p>"We have a certain way of working with a certain number of players that we like to work with and when you've got more than that number it becomes a little bit complicated.</p>
      <p>"So I'm not all that keen on just bringing players in for the sake of bringing players in, and I don't want us to be that club that signs players just because they're available. If we are going to be bring players in, I want them to be players that we really want and that they fit into the playing style and what's needed.</p>
      <p>"It's about a certain profile of player.</p>
      <p>"If that sort of player becomes available then we'll see what we can do. If we can do it, great. If we can't then we'll carry on with our work.</p>
      <p>"We've got something like nine games before Christmas, and I really believe in the players we've got.</p>
      <p>"With so many games coming thick and fast, I think that's the only thing you can look at.</p>

      <p>"When January comes, we'll have a conversation over whether there's anything to do.</p>
      <p>"We won't be spending big because we aren't that club. You'll see other teams around us spending big and really throwing money at it.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure we need to do that. Even if the money was available."</p>
      <p>The last few windows have seen the club place a greater emphasis on outgoings, and fans may well understandably be a little cautious about what the upcoming window will hold, and what effect it could have on their tilt for an unlikely promotion push.</p>
      <p>The club made no secret of their desire to move on the likes of Andre Ayew and Borja Baston in the summer, although both have now helped play pivotal roles in City's season.</p>
      <p>Their futures may well become the subject of speculation once more when January rolls round.</p>
      <p>However, Cooper insists there hasn't been any suggestion that the club are keen to push any of their remaining big names out of the door.</p>
      <p>"There's always a possibility [of departures]," he added.</p>
      <p>"But I don't think we'll be on our own there. There are always one or two players that you look at and you think 'they could go up another level', and I think we have players that could do that too.</p>
      <p>"I guess there's always that possibility. I hope not! And there's certainly nothing to report in terms of any interest.</p>
      <p>"I hope that continues."</p>
      <p>The arrival of Trevor Birch, combined with the high-profile sales of Oli McBurnie and Daniel James, have helped to ease the financial burden of relegation from the Premier League, and Cooper says the club are no longer in a position where they need to sell players to balance the books.</p>
      <p>"I haven't explicitly heard that and I'd be surprised," he added.</p>
      <p>"I think I would know if that was the case."</p>
