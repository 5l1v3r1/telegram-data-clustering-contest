        <i>“I was interested. I was following Formula E from the beginning and it was interesting. It was the only championship I was looking to come and race after Formula One."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Formula E has been marketed as the eco-friendly version of motorsport and Massa thinks that this means the future of the sport is strong. </p>
      <p><i>“I concentrate on Formula E, because I believe in the future of Formula E more than I believe in the future of the other championship," </i>he said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I am sure that any driver that does not have the possibility to stay in Formula One, they will try and come to Formula E, I am 100 percent sure.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see how Formula E and Formula 1 will develop over the next few years. At the moment Formula 1 is still miles ahead of the electric series but Formula E is continuing to grow. </p>
