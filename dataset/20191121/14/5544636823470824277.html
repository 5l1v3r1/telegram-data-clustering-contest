      <p>Nigerian singer, Tobechukwu Okoh, better known as <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Peruzzi</a> has been accused of a breach of contract by his former record label, Golden Boy Entertainment.</p>
      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> understands that the record label has commenced a legal action against the singer at Lagos High Court.</p>
      <p>According to Golden Boy entertainment, Peruzzi threatened the officials of the record label and also refused to remit proceeds from musical performances into their account.</p>
      <p>A document obtained online in which a representative of the label published, reads; “GoldenBoy Entertainment has commenced legal proceedings against Peruzzi in suit Suit No: LD2902GCM/2018 at the High Court of Lagos State. Rather than submit to the jurisdiction of the court, Peruzzi has been going about threatening officials of GoldenBoy with violence. In addition, he has shown so much disdain and disrespect for the judicial process.”</p>
      <p>It also reads, “as it is now, GoldenBoy has not made any amount whatsoever from its intellectual property rights with respect to all works written, produced, co-produced and performed by Peruzzi since the inception of the agreement.”</p>
      <p>Recall that last year, <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2018/08/06/how-davido-cheated-me-with-peruzzi-record-label-boss/">Golden Boy Entertainment boss, Patrick Anyaene accused DMW entertainment boss, Davido of cheating him with Peruzzi</a>.</p>
      <p>Anyaene said prior to Peruzzi signing a deal with the label, he and Davido cheated him unfairly.</p>
      <p>The Golden Boy boss took to his Instagram page to accuse his former label act of giving out his songs to the ‘Assurance’ singer, adding that without him, the singer wouldn’t have made any hit in 2017.</p>
