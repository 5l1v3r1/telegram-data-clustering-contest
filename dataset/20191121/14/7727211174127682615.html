      <h1>Parole Board statement in full after Helen McCourt's murderer Ian Simms set for release</h1>
      <h2>Ian Simms refused to reveal where body of 22-year-old was buried but officials impressed by 'considerable change in his behaviour'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:32:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/ben-turner/" target="_blank">Ben Turner-LE</a></address>
      <p>The Parole Board has explained its reasoning for releasing Helen McCourt's murderer Ian Simms - despite his stubborn refusal to confess to where he buried her body.</p>
      <p>Simms from Billinge abducted and murdered Helen McCourt, 22, in 1988.</p>
      <p>He has never told police where he disposed of her body despite her family repeatedly appealing for him to do so.</p>
      <p>Simms, the landlord of a pub then called the George and Dragon in Billinge, was convicted of Helen's murder in 1989 and was given a life sentence with a maximum tariff of 16 years.</p>
      <p>Today The Parole Board gave its rationale behind allowing her killer to walk the streets again and said the tight-lipped murderer's good behaviour was a major factor.</p>
      <h3>The Parole Board's statement in full reads:</h3>
      <p>"Taking into account the denial, the refusal to reveal where the victim's body is, all the risk factors, the progress that Mr Simms has made, the considerable change in his behaviour, the fact that he has not been involved in any violence or substance misuse for many years, his protective factors, the recommendations from all the professionals and all the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel was satisfied that Mr Simms met the test for release."</p>

      <p>The murder of Helen McCourt was one of the first UK cases to be solved using DNA.</p>
      <p>Simms was convicted after he was found with blood on his clothes which matched that of Helen’s parents, and her opal and sapphire earring was found in his car.</p>
      <p>His bloodstained clothes were recovered from banks of a river, and a knotted strangling flex discovered nearby had teeth marks in it, matching those of the landlord’s dog and hairs identical to Helen’s caught in it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/mum-begs-parole-board-keep-17230683">Helen's mum Marie led a long campaign</a> for the introduction of a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/no-body-no-parole-mccourt-17082528">'Helen's Law'</a> in her daughter's name, which would mean killers would have to disclose the whereabouts of their victim's remains before being considered for parole.</p>
      <p>In the last three months, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/woodland-near-clay-pits-being-16991047">Marie has started a fresh search for her daughter</a> , with new suggestions she could be in Rixton clay pits, in nearby Warrington, 15 miles from Helen's home in Billinge, in a 200m zone, where Simms held a fishing license in another man’s name.</p>
      <p>Marie added: "After Helen's death, my life has changed drastically, I didn't go out, I avoided people and only went outside on a Sunday when I was searching for her.</p>
      <p>"I don't think Simms will ever tell me where she is.</p>
      <p>"It's like a power thing for killers like him, he's just a chip off the old block."</p>
