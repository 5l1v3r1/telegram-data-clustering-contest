      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> admits he was ‘surprised’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> decided to part ways with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and move for Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Spurs have endured a miserable start to the 2019-20 campaign but had reached the Champions League final under Pochettino last season.</p>
      <p>Shortly after Daniel Levy opted to sack Pochettino, Tottenham announced the former Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid manager Mourinho as their new manager.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the change, Arsenal boss Emery said: ‘I think it’s a surprise how it finished with Pochettino.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t know exactly why and how it’s going to change their performance.</p>
      <p>‘[Jose] is a very good coach his career is strong with titles and experience and I think also Pochettino working in Tottenham was amazing.’</p>
      <p>Asked whether he was surprised by Pochettino’s sacking, Emery said: ‘Yes, for me it was a surprise.</p>

      <p>‘Maybe the last matches they didn’t achieve a good result but in the last year with Pochetinno was perfect.</p>
      <p>‘They decided to change and I don’t know the reason but we have our way and they have their way. We want to keep that distance [ahead of them in the table].’</p>
