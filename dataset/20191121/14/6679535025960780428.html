      <h1>Jawan’s mortal remains cremated</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:52:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-Correspondent-Mandya-22462/" target="_blank">Special Correspondent Mandya</a></address>
      <p>The mortal remains of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan H.N. Devaraj, who died owing to illness in Coimbatore on Wednesday, was cremated with military and state honours at his native village Haniyambadi in the taluk on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Villagers and his relatives staged a protest before the cremation accusing the district administration of “disrespecting the soldier by not receiving the mortal remains properly”.</p>
      <p>Mr. Devaraj, attached to the 17th battalion, was suffering from jaundice and other related illness, said Haniyambadi Nagaraj, a Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) leader.</p>
      <p>The family was informed about his death on Wednesday itself and the body was sent in a CRPF vehicle with a party of jawans.</p>
      <p>The relatives and the villagers wanted the senior officials to be present when the vehicle reached the town. Nevertheless, the officials were tied up with some K.R. Pet Assembly segment-bypoll works. That prompted the villagers to hold the protest.</p>
      <p>However, Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh, Superintendent of Police K. Parashuram and other officials came there and paid their respects to the jawan. Later, the mortal remains were cremated.</p>
      <p>The body was kept for the public to pay homage at the village.</p>
      <p>The CRPF jawan is survived by parents Doddanarayani and Boramma, wife Deepika and sons Manju and Akash.</p>
