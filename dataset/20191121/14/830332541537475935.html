      <h1>Man impersonated Lufthansa pilot</h1>
      <h2>He was eventually arrested at an airport in India</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:51:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Manveena Suri, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Frequent flier Rajan Mahbubani thought he had discovered the ultimate hack for getting preferential treatment at airports. Instead it got him arrested.</p>
      <p>In a case that's been compared to the Leonardo DiCaprio conman movie "Catch Me If You Can," the 48-year-old allegedly donned the uniform of a Lufthansa pilot in order to fool airport workers into letting him bypass security lines and get seat upgrades.</p>
      <p>It apparently worked too, right up until the point he was caught at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Mahbubani was dressed in a pilot's uniform when arrested at the departure gate as he was about to board an AirAsia flight from Delhi to Kolkata, police said.</p>
      <p>Sanjay Bhatia, the airport's deputy commissioner of police, told CNN that a Lufthansa employee had alerted airport security that a "suspected passenger was impersonating a captain of Lufthansa airline."</p>
      <p>This came after AirAsia had called Lufthansa to verify his identity.</p>
      <p>Mahbubani, who is from New Delhi, was detained and handed over to Delhi Police. He was found carrying a fake Lufthansa pilot ID that he used to gain privileges at airports.</p>
      <p>"After his arrest, Mahbubani told us he used to shoot YouTube and TikTok videos on aviation and had obtained the Lufthansa fake ID card in Thailand," Bhatia said.</p>
      <h3>'Cheating and impersonating'</h3>
      <p>Airport security officials were already on the lookout for him, apparently, because of videos on his social media platforms.</p>
      <p>Police said Mahbubani subsequently told police he liked to dress up in uniforms. They recovered pictures of him dressed in an army uniform from his phone.</p>
      <p>"Mahbubani said that he was a frequent flier and used to dress up as a pilot to gain easy access through security, get preferential treatment from security agencies and airlines and seat upgrades," said Bhatia. "He would use the passage normally used by airline crew."</p>
      <p>He's now in custody facing charges of cheating and impersonating. If convicted he could face a year in prison or a fine, or both.</p>
      <p>Mahbubani's alleged impersonation recalls the real-life exploits of serial fraudster Frank Abagnale, who impersonated flight crew to get free travel during a career of crime that was later dramatized by Steven Spielberg in the 2002 movie "Catch Me If You Can."</p>
      <p>It's not the only case of identity switch seen in India lately. In September, 32-year-old Jayesh Patel <a href="https://cnn.com/travel/article/new-delhi-airport-man-impersonates-senior-citizen/index.html">was arrested at the same airport</a> for impersonating an 81-year-old in an attempt to board a flight to New York.</p>
