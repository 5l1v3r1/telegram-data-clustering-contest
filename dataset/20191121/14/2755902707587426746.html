      <p>Eyebrows were raised when ailing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga’s Wikipedia profile claimed yesterday that he died on the 18th of November at a Chinese military hospital.</p>
      <p>However the profile has since been updated to show that VP Chiwenga is very much alive and  well. His academic qualifications(Ph.D in Genocide) have also been updated to Political Science.</p>

      <p>According to sources, Chiwenga is set to return home after recovering from the two major surgeries he had to undergo.</p>
      <p>He is reportedly expected back in Zimbabwe either at the end of November or at the beginning of December.</p>
