The band of overhead supply between $1474/$1480 has come in to act as a barrier to the recovery and yesterday’s high at $1279 is notable. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/gold-the-failure-to-push-ahead-in-its-recovery-momentum-will-come-as-disappointment-for-the-bulls-201911211128">Read more...</a></p>
