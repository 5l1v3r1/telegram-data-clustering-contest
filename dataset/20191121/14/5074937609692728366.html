      <h1>Kpone Katamanso residents demonstrate against poor roads</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:11:24+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Elizabeth Baah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov 20,  GNA - Residents of Atadeka, Washington, New York and its environs under the Kpone Katamanso Municipality have staged a demonstration against poor roads and lack of drainage system in the entire area.</p>
      <p>The demonstration started around 0530 hours as a means of drawing the attention of the authorities to support them by providing them with the necessary amenities needed in the communities.</p>
      <p>The demonstrators appealed to Mr Solomon Tettey Appiah, the Municipal Chief Executive to assist in providing solutions for the deplorable road and drainage system.</p>
      <p>“We have written letters to the MCE so that the roads and gutters will be constructed and we are through the demonstration appealing to him and assembly to come quickly to our aid,” they explained.</p>
      <p>According to them, the deplorable stage of the road has become a major challenge to the health of the people as conveying pregnant women and people in critical health conditions to hospitals is our headache.</p>
      <p>They further explained that despite government’s assurance and pledges on multiple occasions, no significant action seemed to have been achieved leaving, the residents to resort to demonstration to compel the authorities to fix the road and drainage system.</p>
      <p>They therefore called on the government to come to their aid with immediate by fulfilling all the promises he made.</p>
