        <b>Kylian Mbappe is battling a bout of illness but Thomas Tuchel should be able to call upon Neymar once more when PSG host Lille.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Neymar is ready to return to action for Paris Saint-Germain against Lille on Saturday, but the Ligue 1 champions could be without Kylian Mbappe.</p>
      <p>The Brazil superstar has not featured for his club since sustaining a hamstring injury during the October international break, continuing a tale of fitness woe that has stained his time at the Parc des Princes.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a pre-match news conference, head coach Thomas Tuchel confirmed Neymar would be available for a mouth-watering week of fixtures, with trips to Real Madrid and Monaco coming after Lille’s visit to the French capital.</p>
      <p>“Neymar feels good,” Tuchel said. “He has trained well and will be in the group for tomorrow’s match, but he will not be able to play 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>“He will bring us quality and decisive things. When he is with us, we are super dangerous. That is necessary if we want to continue to win</p>
      <p>“Lille, Real Madrid and Monaco represent three challenging games for us.”</p>
      <p>Mbappe has often stepped up in Neymar’s absence, but the France forward has been laid low by illness having already suffered hamstring, thigh and groin setbacks this term.</p>

      <p>“He had a fever, he has to start training today, we have to wait,” said Tuchel, who will be without midfield duo Marco Verratti (knee) and Ander Herrera (thigh).</p>
      <p>Neymar’s rehabilitation took in a trip to watch the Davis Cup in Madrid this week, something which neither delighted nor angered his boss.</p>
      <p>“What can I do? I’m not his father, nor the police. I am just his coach,” Tuchel added.</p>
      <p>“He trained well. Did I enjoy his trip to Madrid? No. But he was very professional during those two weeks.</p>
      <p>“He did more than others, working with the group and also individually. If all goes well, he can play [against Lille]. Tomorrow we will decide”.</p>
