      <p>Grab a weapon and a bucket because you’re going scrumping for apples for this week’s Fortnite challenge.</p>
      <p>To complete this challenge, you’ll need to consume foraged apples from <b>The Orchard</b> landmark. You’ve probably wandered into this area a few times before and spotted some red apples lying around, which will replenish some of your health when eaten.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t found <b>The Orchard </b>yet, you’ll be able to find it just Northeast of <b>Frenzy Farm,</b> which you can see on the map below.</p>
      <h3>Consume foraged apples at The Orchard</h3>
      <p>Before going hunting for apples, it would be a good idea to make sure you’ve got a weapon or two to hand and to build a few walls around yourself for protection. Better yet, you can activate <b>Party Assist</b> and have a friend watch your back while you gobble up apples.</p>
      <p>If your health bar is full, you might not be able to consume them, so now might be the time to risk a few hits. That way, you’ll have a chance at completing the elimination challenge where you must defeat an opponent while your health is at 50 or less, then quickly regain health by chomping on some fruit.</p>
