      <p>LUNENBURG, N.S. – Lobster fishing season begins next week for districts 33 and 34 in southwestern Nova Scotia, and it appears one crew is about to make history.</p>
      <p>The Nellie Row is just one of many boats that will be setting sail, but the fishers on board aren’t your typical crew -- it is believed the Nellie Row boasts the first all-female crew on Nova Scotia’s South Shore.</p>
      <p>“It sounds a lot more romantic than it probably will be,” laughs Capt. Gail Atkinson. “I like to fish with people that I get along with and that we can have fun together, hopefully, and really enjoy the experience, and people who feel super invested in it.”</p>
      <p>Atkinson says her love of the sea came naturally. She was born into a fishing family and often worked on her father’s boat, before buying her own four years ago.</p>
      <p>“I decided to take the plunge at the ripe old age of 50, which is kind of old to get a licence,” she says. “It was going to be now or never, so I decided to do it.”</p>
      <p>Joining Atkinson on the water is her partner in life and business, Kath Moore, as well as deckhands Annie Featherstone and Sophie Martel.</p>
      <p>All four women combined have an extensive resume of life at sea, which includes work on Nova Scotia’s iconic schooner, the Bluenose II, and the Lunenburg-based tall ship Picton Castle, which offers a training program for young mariners.</p>
      <p>Featherstone, who is originally from Ontario, says this will be her first year lobster fishing, and she’s up for the challenge.</p>
      <p>“I was on the Picton in the Bosun School Program and working across the wharf from the lobster fishermen and a schoolmate of mine said she was going to go, and I said, ‘I want to go, but I want to go with the women,’” she says.</p>
      <p>Even the boat is named after a woman -- Atkinson’s grandmother, Nellie. The boat is from Cape Sable Island and has historic and family ties.</p>
      <p>“There’s a bit of history with the boatyard where it came from. My grandmother, Nellie, worked there until she was, like, 65 years old, until she retired, and she worked in a number  of boat shops during her career,” explains Atkinson.</p>
      <p>“So that was extra special to me, and this is the same hull that I fished on with my dad, so I have a lot of faith in the hull, it’s a nice deep hull and I think it’ll take care of us out there.”</p>
      <p>Not only does Atkinson have faith in her boat, she also has faith in her all-female crew, proving women have a place in the lobster fishing industry.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of just a lead-by-example kind of thing,” says Kath Moore. “We’re out there doing it so there’s no reason why any other woman can’t do it too, if they have the drive.”</p>
      <p>With their drive and experience, the women don’t doubt they will have a successful season building camaraderie and catching lobsters.</p>
