      <h1>Ultrasound wave to brain may ease common hand tremor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:53:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author">Amy Norton, HealthDay News</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 21 -- A treatment that delivers ultrasound waves to the brain may bring lasting relief to some people with debilitating hand tremors, a new study finds.</p>
      <p>The study involved 76 patients with essential tremor -- a neurological condition that most often causes trembling in the hands during routine tasks like writing, eating and dressing. It can also affect the legs, head, trunk or voice.</p>
      <p>Essential tremor is common -- affecting upwards of 7 million Americans, according to the American Academy of Neurology.</p>
      <p>Yet many people have never heard of it, said Dr. Casey Halpern, the lead researcher on the new study and a neurosurgeon at Stanford University in California.</p>
      <p>The cause of essential tremor is unknown, and there is no cure. However, there are treatments. Medications, including certain blood pressure and anti-seizure drugs, can help control the tremors.</p>
      <p>When drugs fail, another option is deep brain stimulation, or DBS, where electrodes are placed in a specific brain region that helps control muscle activity. A pacemaker-like device, implanted under the collarbone, can then continuously send electrical pulses to the brain area -- blocking signals that cause the tremors.</p>
      <p>More recently, doctors have been trying a less-invasive approach called focused ultrasound thalamotomy. The procedure uses ultrasound waves, guided by MRI, to heat and destroy tiny areas of brain tissue that are triggering the tremors.</p>
      <p>The treatment was approved by the U.S. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Food_and_Drug_Administration/?tps=1">Food and Drug Administration</a> in 2016, so there's been little known about its longer-term results.</p>
      <p>Halpern's team found that when patients benefit from the procedure, there is a good chance the results will last.</p>
      <p>The researchers used a standard scale to gauge patients' hand tremor and problems with daily function. Before the procedure, the study group scored an average of 20, out of a range of 0 to 32. Six months later, that had dropped (improved) to 8.6; at year three, it had risen slightly, to 9.5.</p>
      <p>Overall, 58 percent of patients were showing at least a 50 percent improvement in their hand tremors and function at the three-year point, the findings showed.</p>
      <p>"There can be some return of tremor, and patients should be aware of that," Halpern said.</p>
      <p>But, on balance, he added, the benefits were durable. And there were no unexpected long-term side effects.</p>
      <p>That's not to say there were no problems. The procedure can leave patients with some tingling and numbness, balance issues or muscle weakness -- side effects that may persist. Of patients in this study, 14 percent still had tingling and numbness at year three, while almost 7 percent had balance problems, and just under 3 percent had muscle weakness.</p>
      <p>All said those issues were mild to moderate.</p>
      <p>The study, published online Nov. 20 in Neurology, was partly funded by Insightec -- an Israel-based maker of focused ultrasound equipment.</p>
      <p>According to Halpern, the ultrasound approach has some clear advantages over deep brain stimulation.</p>
      <p>"There's no incision, no anesthesia, no devices implanted," he pointed out.</p>
      <p>A disadvantage, though, is that the ultrasound therapy is currently performed on only one side of the brain. "That means you can only treat the dominant hand, not both," Halpern said.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sean Nagel is a neurosurgeon at the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cleveland_Clinic/?tps=1">Cleveland Clinic</a> in Ohio -- one of the few medical centers in the United States performing focused ultrasound for essential tremor.</p>
      <p>Nagel, who was not involved in the new study, called the results "encouraging."</p>
      <p>"This is still a new therapy. But the early outcomes look good," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think that for patients who've been reluctant to take the next step and try DBS, this is something worth talking to their neurologist about," Nagel said.</p>
      <p>Nationally, only about a dozen hospitals offer the treatment, according to Halpern.</p>
      <p>"But with more time," he said, "I expect it'll become more widely available."</p>
