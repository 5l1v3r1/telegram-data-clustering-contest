      <p>Finally, the CEO of Burniton Music Group, Stonebwoy has explained why he does not sing Kelvyn Boy’s verse on “Kpo Keke” when he mounts stage since he sacked Kelvyn Boy from Bhim Nation.</p>
      <p>According to Stonebwoy, it’s not something he does to hit back at Kelvyn Boy for his betrayal as some people are claiming.</p>

      <p>He explained that mostly he has about 10 minutes to perform on stage and if he concentrates on singing all the verses on ‘Kpo Keke’ he will be left with just a few minutes to touch on other songs.</p>
      <p>So he sings just the two verses of the song and jumps to other songs in order not to leave his fans unsatisfied from his performance.</p>

      <p>
        <i>“oo, sometimes I don’t get some people oo, it seems people just sit down and want to set an agenda. The Kpo K3k3 song is more than 4 minutes long and I’ve been given just 10 minutes to perform on stage.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He continued,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Because I want to perform my other songs too, so I always perform the first-two verses of Kpo k3k3 and I move on to my other songs, if you realized, I always perform up to Medikal’s verse then I move on to my other songs.</i>

      <p>
        <i>Even Kelvyn Boy’s verse is the last verse on the song, if I have to perform the full song, then I won’t have enough time to perform my other songs, and that’s it,” Stonebwoy added.</i>
