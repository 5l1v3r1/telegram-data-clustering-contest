      <p>We all know that one person who takes decorating for Christmas to another level.</p>
      <p>But a Valleys salon has gone above and beyond and has transformed itself into the set of Alice in Wonderland.</p>
      <p>Rhys Jones, 32, spent three days and more than £3,000 to get the magical look - complete with a 12 foot Cheshire cat tail and furniture stuck to the ceiling.</p>
      <p>According to the Christmas-mad hairdresser, though, it's all worth it to see the look on his customers' faces.</p>

      <p>Rhys, who owns Vanity Hair Lounge in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/rhondda">Gelli,</a> said: "As soon as the salon closed the family came over to help. It took three days.</p>
      <p>"I put the final touches on last night and literally collapsed into bed."</p>
      <p>The fairytale wonderland isn't the first time Rhys's Christmas efforts have impressed passers by.</p>
      <p>Last year his icy snow scene complete with hundreds of fairy lights and a giant glittery unicorn <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/valleys-hairdressers-transformed-winter-wonderland-15377227">attracted hundreds of visitors from near and far.</a></p>

      <p>He said: "[Last year] people were in the bus driving past and would say they needed to come in and see it. We gained so many new clients.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to follow on from last year and the only thing that made sense was to do Alice in Wonderland this year and go for the complete opposite - so really colourful rather than icy."</p>
      <p>He added: "It's taken a whole year, I would go look now and again and we would go shopping and looking for things.</p>
      <p>"We bought a wrought iron air balloon from an antiques shop and we have a 12 foot Cheshire cat tail which a client made. It's stuffed with a mattress. We have pink chairs hanging from the ceiling.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to go with an upside down theme to feel like everything is suspended.</p>
      <p>"For the tea party there's fake food which have been made from polysterene."</p>

      <p>For Rhys, his masterpiece wouldn't be possible without the help of his mam, stepdad, brother and sister.</p>
      <p>Together, with the help of some Christmas music and a drink or two, the family worked around the clock, and until midnight on Saturday, to get the display ready on time.</p>
      <p>Rhys, who lives in a flat above the hairdressers, said: "It's not easy as we all work such long hours but we all chip in. It's got to be done and you need some alcohol!</p>
      <p>"It only opened [on Monday] but everyone who's been in looking has been asking if they can take videos and pictures.</p>
      <p>"I definitely need upstairs to match downstairs now, but maybe not to the same extent!</p>
      <p>"I'm always thinking of different themes, I've already planned next year's. Next year we will have been there 10 years so it needs to be even bigger."</p>

      <p>So far Rhys hasn't sat down to add up the cost of his creation - but puts it at more than £3,000.</p>
      <p>He said: "It sounds like a lot of money but when you spread it over the year it's worth it."</p>
      <p>Rhys's mum Maria added: "People always ask me what Rhys is doing this year. I get it from around October because sine we work in the same area his clients are my clients.</p>
      <p>"He's been working on it since March. He never uses the same decorations twice."</p>
