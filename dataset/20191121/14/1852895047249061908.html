      <h1>Princess Love Says Ray J Blocked Her On Instagram After She Alleged He Abandoned Her &amp; Baby In Vegas</h1>

      <h4>The war between estranged couple, Ray J and Princess Love is getting uglier by the day. After she accused him of leaving her and their 18-month-old daughter ‘stranded’ in Las Vegas, the pregnant model now claims the rapper blocked her on social media.</h4>
      <p><b>Princess Love </b>may be ready to sever ties with her husband, <b><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/ray-j/">Ray J</a></b>. The model, 35, who is pregnant with their second child, revealed that the rapper, 38, blocked her on Instagram, according to a screenshot captured by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Ginufhq7A/"><i>The Shade Room</i></a>. The latter comes after Princess <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/19/princess-love-shades-husband-ray-j-stranded-las-vegas-daughter-melody-accusation/">accused Ray</a> of leaving her and their 18-month-old daughter <b>Melody</b>, “stranded” in Las Vegas on November 17, following BET’s Soul Train Awards.</p>
      <p>“Somebody tell Scooty boy he’s only hurting himself 😂😂😂,” Princess allegedly wrote next to a screenshot of Ray J’s account, which she can no longer see. “This is so funny to me.” In response to a fan, that wrote, “My future husband would never,”  Princess  replied, “Mine either, sis.”</p>
      <p>As the estranged couple’s relationship woes continue to play out on social media, Princess tweeted a cryptic message, hinting at the end of their relationship. “Time to let go,” she tweeted on November 20. Before that, Princess hadn’t tweeted since later October when she retweeted Love &amp; Hip Hope’s video of her with Ray and their daughter during happier times.</p>

      <p>News of the pair’s marriage troubles came earlier this week when Princess accused Ray of leaving her and their child in Sin City after the Soul Train Awards Sunday night — after he shared a family photo of them smiling for the cameras on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>“Left me and Melody stranded in Vegas and blocked me from calling,” she wrote, adding, “now you wanna post family photos #ByeUgly.”</p>
      <p>Princess and Ray J dated for four years before they tied the knot in August 2016. The couple welcomed Melody, their first child together, in May 2018. They announced Princess’ second pregnancy in August, and said she’s expecting in January 2020.</p>
      <p>In October, Princess and Ray J went all out when they revealed the sex of their baby-to-be, which included a helicopter ride and blue smoke.</p>
      <p>“Whoa! We’re having a boy! Hey!” Ray announced in a video on social media as blue smoke filled the air. “We’re having a boy!”, he said excitedly from the chopper.</p>
