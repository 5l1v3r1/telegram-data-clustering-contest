      <p>Ruiz produced one of boxing’s biggest upsets when he dethroned the previously undefeated world heavyweight champion with a seventh-round stoppage at New York’s Madison Square Garden in June.</p>
      <p>While speaking to BBC Joshua attributed his defeat to lack of experience and his lose has made him learn more. Acknowledging that Ruiz is a good fighter, Joshua said he doubt if Mexican-American fighter could beat him twice.</p>
      <blockquote>“<i>It wasn’t burnout. The issues I faced in the last camp, it’s just down to lack of experience,” <br/></i><br/><i>“Even though it was at a high level, we were still finding experience. Andy Ruiz is good but I don’t think he should beat me twice.<br/></i><br/><i>I used to hear guys say you have to take a loss and I would think ‘why’? Now I can understand it and know what it takes.<br/></i><br/><i>I have more understanding now and my ears are open to new information so that’s making me smarter as a fighter,” Joshua said.<br/></i><br/><i>“The blessing is I have a second chance and here we are,” the 30-year-old said.</i></blockquote>
      <p>The WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight title rematch – dubbed the ‘Clash on the Dunes’, will take place in Saudi Arabia on Dec. 7 after former Olympic Champion Joshua triggered a rematch clause.</p>
