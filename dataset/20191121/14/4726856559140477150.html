      <p>CALGARY – The intricacies of Alberta’s plans to recoup costs related to the opioid crisis are expected to be released Thursday as the province prepares to join a class-action lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Tyler Shandro first <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/alberta-joining-class-action-lawsuit-against-opioid-manufacturers-distributors-1.4639433">made the announcement in October</a> and is slated to provide details on proposed legislation that will pave the way for the province to join the suit against opioid manufacturers and distributers.</p>
      <p>British Columbia filed the lawsuit in November of 2018, alleging drug manufactures falsely marketed opioids as less addictive than other pain drugs and triggered a crisis that’s killed thousands.</p>
      <p>Shandro says there have been almost 800 fatal overdoses and 4,200 emergency calls related to opioids in Alberta in 2018 alone.</p>
      <p>He says, as a result, Alberta spends $53 million a year on healthcare related to opioids and is expects to spend an additional $40 million.</p>
      <p>Both Ontario and Newfoundland have also announced plans to joins the suit.</p>
      <p>None of the allegations in the lawsuit has been tested in court. In the United States there have been <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/alberta-joining-class-action-lawsuit-against-opioid-manufacturers-distributors-1.4639433">several rulings against drug manufacturers resulting in million and billions of dollars in payouts</a>. </p>
