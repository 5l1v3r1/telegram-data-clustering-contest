      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Malaysian authorities have arrested hundreds of Chinese nationals after raiding a suspected online scam syndicate near Kuala Lumpur, officials said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Authorities <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3038808/680-chinese-held-malaysia-over-online-scam-targeting-wechat-pay">stormed a building</a> that housed a call center in Cyberjaya and detained more than 600 people. Investigators said about 100 others escaped through a window.</p>
      <p>"During the operation, 680 nationals from China comprising 603 men and 77 women aged between 19 and 35 were detained," Malaysia Immigration Department Director-General Khairul Dzaimee Daud said Thursday. "Some of them attempted to attack immigration officers."</p>
      <p>Authorities <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/21/immigration-confirms-680-arrested-in-cyberjaya-in-this-years-biggest-single-operation#cxrecs_s">said the syndicate</a> lured users of WeChat and Chinese banks with a sophisticated operation that offered handsome and quick returns on transactions. Immigration officials said they'd operated in Malaysia for six months.</p>
      <p>WeChat is China's most popular messaging app and claims more than a billion monthly users.</p>
      <p>"We seized around 8,230 [cellphones], 174 laptops and 787 computers," Daud said. "Several of our officers were injured after a group attacked and tried to break through our barricade."</p>
      <p>Officials said workers at the call center entered Malaysia with social visit passes and most did not have a passport.</p>
      <p>"No representative has come forward with their documents and the Chinese embassy has been notified of developments," Daud added.</p>
