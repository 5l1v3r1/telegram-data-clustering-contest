      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:52:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>One of the most-hyped games of the NFL’s regular season is taking place on Sunday afternoon. The New England Patriots are hosting the Dallas Cowboys in Foxborough.</p>
      <p>Tom Brady appears to be ready to go.</p>
      <p>The Patriots quarterback, who’s struggled in the passing games at times this season, is channeling is inner Yoda ahead of Sunday’s game.</p>
      <p>“Do or do not. There is no try,” Brady tweeted.</p>
      <p>The tweet has been retweeted more than 11,000 times and liked more than 83,000 times. Decent numbers, for sure.</p>

      <p>Brady has been frustrated with the state of the Patriots’ offense this season, but New England could break out Sunday vs. Dallas. The Cowboys’ defense has played poorly for much of the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to be 9-1, but we just have high expectations for what we’re doing as an offense, so we’re just trying to figure out how we can do things consistently, with dependability, and guys are working hard at it,” Brady said. “Sometimes it comes together early, middle of the season, late in the season. The only thing that matters really is this week and trying to beat a really good football team.”</p>
      <p>The Cowboys and the Patriots are set to kick off at 4:25 p.m. E.T. on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The game will be on FOX.</p>
