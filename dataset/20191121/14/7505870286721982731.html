      <p>Black Friday deals are all about slashing prices and selling amazing electronics for a fraction of the cost. But what if we told you about a deal that was so good, it started almost two weeks early? In anticipation of Turkey Day, Lenovo wants you to be able to shop online by letting you buy your electronics before Black Friday even arrives.</p>
      <p>Right now, Lenovo is offering some of the top deals you’ll see all year on the best selling business laptop ever: the ThinkPad. With this sale, you’ll have a ton of laptops to choose from as you’ll be able to get up to <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/think">53% off ThinkPad laptops</a>, starting at $251.40! That’s right, you’re saving more than half off the regular price of a premium computer just for participating in this deal.</p>
      <p>If you’ve been in the market for a new laptop and want a durable, reliable and fast laptop, you can’t do much better than a ThinkPad. Lenovo recognizes that and on top of the 53% off ThinkPad laptops, they are also <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/think">offering 45% off most X and T series ThinkPad laptops</a> starting at $763.95!</p>
      <p>The X series is known for its epic battery life and ultra portability, so you can keep it in your bag and bring it with you wherever you need to go without having to worry about finding an outlet immediately. If you want superior performance in a lightweight design, you should take a look at the X1 Carbon Gen 7 or 6. If amazing graphics is a characteristic you’re dying for, then the X1 Extreme Gen 2 ad 1 could be right for you. For those who want the versatility of a 2-in-1 device, take a look at the X1 Yoga Gen 4/3/2/1.</p>
      <p>The T series is Lenovo’s flagship line of laptops and will have you covered just about anywhere. For those looking for super fast speeds from their USB-C ports, this is the line of laptops for you. The sleek yet sturdy design of the T590 makes it one of the top new laptops on the market. You won’t be disappointed with any business laptop in the T series, as you’ll be able to choose from the T495/495s, T490/490s, T580, T480/480s, and T470/470s. All of these feature unbelievably long-lasting batteries and easy configuration, so you’ll be ready to work in seconds.</p>
      <p>Now, while the X and T series are both fantastic in their own right, Lenovo is offering even more deals during this sale. The next deal offers you <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-e-series/c/thinkpade">40-50% off E series ThinkPad laptops,</a> starting at $629.40! This opens up even more possibilities for you to save and come away with sweet tech. Perfect for small business owners, the E series is known for its security and privacy settings. You’ll be amazed at how the E490 and 490s protect your information and how reliable the E595 is. For those looking to handle video conferencing, the E590 can’t be beat.</p>
      <p>With these kind of deals, it’ll be hard to find reasons not to take advantage of this amazing pre-Black Friday sale.
