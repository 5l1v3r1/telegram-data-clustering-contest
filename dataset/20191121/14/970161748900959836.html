      <p>A beloved teacher was diagnosed with cancer after working in schools filled with asbestos for 28 years.</p>
      <p>Lea DiRusso, 51, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer primarily caused by asbestos exposure, in August after teaching in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a> District of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for nearly three decades.</p>
      <p>DiRusso most recently worked at Meredith Elementary School and often hung her students’ best artwork on a clothesline between two old insulated heating pipes, which would send down white flakes as she put her students’ art on display.</p>
      <p>She told the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/education/a/mesothelioma-philadelphia-school-district-lea-dirusso-cancer-20191121.html">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>: ‘When you come into a room on a Monday morning, and you’re starting to set up, and you see dust across your desk, or dust on the ground, or a ceiling tile fell, as a teacher, this is your pride and joy, it’s your room.’</p>

      <p>‘You just scoop it up, you clean it up, and you move on,’ she continued – only now knowing how dangerous that ‘dust’ was.</p>

      <p>According to School District records, DiRusso’s classroom had a history of asbestos pipe insulation. Medical experts said she was put at a greater risk of inhaling and ingesting the carcinogenic fibers by cleaning her classroom every morning.</p>
      <p>DiRusso learned of her dire Mesothelioma diagnosis in a phone call with her doctor as she helped move her daughter into her college dorm in August.</p>
      <p>Mesothelioma has an average survival of about one year, according to the CDC. DiRusso was found to have peritoneal mesothelioma, which means the cancer has spread to her stomach lining, ovaries, uterus, and small bowel.</p>
      <p>She underwent three rounds of chemotherapy in September and was given a terrifying treatment plan: a risky surgery to remove her cancerous organs, then ‘hot chemo,’ which is a 90 minute abdominal bath in chemotherapy agent heated to 107 degrees.</p>
      <p>DiRusso decided she would undergo the ‘hot chemo,’ officially called HIPEC (hyperthermic interaperitoneal chemoterapy). She was diagnosed early, so her chances of survival are better.</p>

      <p>‘Lucky people get a few more years…but that’s not good enough,’ she said, adding that her treatment is scheduled for December 10.</p>

      <p>DiRusso plans to file a lawsuit against the Philadelphia School District, which said it will to remove as much asbestos from the schools as possible, <a href="https://6abc.com/gma-exclusive-philly-teacher-diagnosed-with-mesothelioma-speaks-out/5710865/">WPVI reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Dr William Hite announced a visual inspection of every building and said: ‘Everything we’ve done hasn’t been enough. We have made some mistakes.’</p>
