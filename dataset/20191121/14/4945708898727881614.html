      <p>Ride-hailing pioneer Uber, rather than being part of the solution to urban transport may be adding to related problems, especially pollution from diesel cars, a study showed Thursday.</p>
      <p>Transport &amp; Environment, which groups NGOs in Europe to promote sustainable transport solutions, said Uber revolutionised the once heavily regulated taxi sector, attracting thousands of new Private Hire Vehicle (PHV) drivers.</p>
      <p>But this "stellar increase in Uber drivers has not been offset by a similar reduction in taxi licences... and Uber's appearance did not accelerate the reduction of car trips in London and Paris."</p>
      <p>Instead, "the convenience of door-to-door, app-based trip booking makes travelling by (hired) cars in cities more and more popular, risking a reversal of a 15 year trend of reducing car trips in cities," the Brussels-based TE said in a summary of the study's findings.</p>
      <p>By the same token, "the uptake of ride-hailing services across EU cities also poses a risk to the fight against pollution and climate changing emissions."</p>
      <p>Uber operations in London, Paris and Brussels likely pump out 525,000 tons of CO2 a year, equivalent to the emissions from 250,000 cars "which runs counter to the cities' ambitions to reduce their climate footprint."</p>
      <p>These vehicles are mostly diesel, it said, noting that "only in London, where it is mandatory, is Uber making an effort to shift to cleaner, electric-powered vehicles."</p>
      <p>Uber is currently unprofitable but valued at around $49 billion on the markets as investors buy into its vision of a transport provider in a new world of electric vehicles and reduced <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/greenhouse+gas+emissions/">greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p>
      <p>"If Uber continues its current business practice of adding more combustion engine cars and fossil-powered kilometres in our cities, it is an obstacle to the transition to green and sustainable cities in Europe," TE said.</p>
      <p>But Uber could also "do the right thing," as promised in its share offer, and "stop adding fossil-fuelled cars to <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/city/">city</a> roads and to rapidly electrify its existing fleet."</p>
      <p>In response Uber said it was committed to moving away from privately owned cars "towards a shared, electric future."</p>
      <p>"To do so, we are actively working with cities across Europe to improve access to clean, safe and affordable modes of transportation."</p>
