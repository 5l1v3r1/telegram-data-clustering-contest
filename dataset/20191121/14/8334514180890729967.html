      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - German data mining software firm Celonis said on Thursday that it had raised $290 mln in a Series C funding round, putting a $2.5 billion valuation on the company that has been compared with enterprise application giant SAP.</p>
      <p>The funding round was led by Arena Holdings and investors included Ryan Smith, the founder of customer experience specialist Qualtrics that was bought by SAP for $8 billion a year ago.</p>
      <p>Celonis, based in Munich and New York, runs a cloud-based service that uses artificial intelligence to mine data and optimize business processes, serving customers including Siemens, 3M, Airbus and Vodafone.</p>
      <p>“We are in a market that shows enormous momentum,” co-CEO and co-founder Bastian Nominacher told Reuters, adding that Celonis would invest the funds raised in its global sales and customer service and in enhancing its cloud platform.</p>
      <p>The funding round brings total investments into Celonis to $370 million.</p>
      <p>“Celonis is the clear market leader in a category with open-ended potential. It has demonstrated an enviable record of growth and value creation for its customers and partners,” said Feroz Dewan, CEO of Arena Holdings.</p>
      <p>The company, founded in 2011, does not publish financial results but says it has been cash-flow positive every year since and is growing at a triple-digit pace.</p>
