      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lily-allen/">Lily Allen</a> might have been planning to stay out of the country until <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> was over, but she’s back – and ‘crying’ over the Labour manifesto for the upcoming general election.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn laid out his party’s promises today, ahead of the vote on 12 December, and it looks like Lily’s a massive fan of them.</p>
      <p>She shared her reaction on Twitter, complete with a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a> crying filter and some hammy acting, telling her followers between fake sobs: ‘Guys, I’ve just watched the Labour manifesto and I… I think it’s the best manifesto I’ve ever seen.’</p>

      <p>Lily had earlier shared a photo of her polling card on Instagram alongside the caption ‘Tories OUT’ – so there’s no guesses who she’s going to be voting for in the election.</p>
      <p>Part of the promises Labour have made include environmental improvements, nationalising public services and protecting the NHS, and giving the public the final say on the terms of Brexit with the option to remain in the European Union.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/lily-allen-channels-inner-disney-princess-takes-daughters-disneyland-avoid-brexit-10969079/">Lily flew out to the USA in October to avoid all the Brexit commotion in the UK</a>, telling her followers: ‘Leaving UK till after Brexit. Good Luck Kids.’</p>

      <p>However, with Brexit not being finalised on 31 October as Boris Johnson had repeatedly claimed he would do, Lily’s had to come back to the same situation.</p>
      <p>Lily’s always been open about her political views and her criticism of the way the country is currently being run and how Brexit is being handled.</p>
      <p>The singer has also been spending more time in the USA since starting to date Stranger Things actor David Harbour a few months ago.</p>
      <p>S<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/lily-allen-accused-of-crying-over-pointless-things-as-she-argues-rule-britannia-should-be-banned-11085476/">he also hit the headlines after claiming the song Rule Britannia should be banned</a>, to which fans told her she spent too much time ‘crying about pointless things’.</p>
