      <h1>BoC's Poloz: Monetary conditions “about right” given the situation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:32:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>While speaking at an event organized by the Ontario Securities Commission in Toronto on Thursday, Bank of Canada (BOC) Governor <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/boc">Stephen Poloz</a> said that he thought monetary conditions were "about right" given the current situation.</p>
      <p>With this comment hinting that the BoC is unlikely to opt-out for a rate cut, the CAD gathered strength against its rivals. The USD/CAD pair, which was trading above 1.3320 in the last hour, fell sharply in the last minutes and was last seen trading at 1.3280, erasing 0.18% on a daily basis. </p>
