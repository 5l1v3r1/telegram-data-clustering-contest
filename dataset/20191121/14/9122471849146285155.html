      <h1>Hue Jackson Explains Why He Left The Colin Kaepernick Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:54:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Hours before Colin Kaepernick was set to work out in front of dozens of NFL scouts, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback switched the venue in order to have full transparency. As a result, former head coach Hue Jackson opted not to participate.</p>
      <p>Jackson was reportedly going to run the workout for Kaepernick. It made sense due to his experience as an offensive coordinator and head coach over the past few years.</p>
      <p>There were several critics that didn’t agree with Jackson’s decision. However, it sounds like he’s at peace with his move.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Jackson sat down with FS1’s Kristine Leahy to talk about Kaepernick’s workout. He also revealed why he left after the venue was changed.</p>
      <p>“I made a decision that the best thing for me to do was get on a plane and go home,” Jackson told Leahy. “To me I think if I went over to the high school and did that, I think I would have been doing that for him more so than for the league.”</p>
      <p>Here’s a brief clip from the interview on FS1’s <i>Fair Game</i>:</p>

      <p>The full interview between Hue Jackson and Kristine Leahy will air on Monday.</p>
      <p>Jackson also revealed which team would be the best fit for Kaepernick – the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
      <p>With only a few weeks remaining in the NFL season, it doesn’t appear that any team is eager to sign Kaepernick. Obviously though, that could change in the blink of an eye.</p>
