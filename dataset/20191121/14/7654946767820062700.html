      <h1>Trump gushes about Apple after tour of Texas factory with Tim Cook</h1>

      <p>President Trump on Thursday gushed about Apple a day after his tour of its manufacturing plant in Texas with CEO Tim Cook.</p>
      <p>“During my visit yesterday to Austin, Texas, for the startup of the new Mac Pro, &amp; the discussion of a new one $billion campus, also in Texas, I asked Tim Cook to see if he could get Apple involved in building 5G in the U.S.,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197492772850348034">Trump tweeted.</a> “They have it all – Money, Technology, Vision &amp; Cook!”</p>
      <p>The factory that the two, who share a friendly relationship, toured on Wednesday assembles upscale Mac Pro desktop computers and has been open since 2013.</p>
      <p>During the visit, Trump touted American-made products <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/14/china-reportedly-wants-more-talks-before-signing-trump-trade-deal/">as a US-China trade deal continues to be hammered out</a>.</p>
      <p>“When you build it in the United States, you don’t have to worry about tariffs,” Trump said, with Cook by his side.</p>
      <p>US tariffs will take effect Dec. 15 on an additional $160 billion in Chinese products — a move that would extend sanctions to consumer goods including clothes, toys and iPhones.</p>
      <p>Trump said Wednesday he was “looking at” the possibility of exempting Apple from the tariffs — an issue Cook has raised with the president before.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Trump <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/07/tim-cook-now-goes-by-tim-apple-on-twitter/">flubbed Cook’s name,</a> referring to him as “Tim Apple” during a press conference.</p>
      <p>The president later explained he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/11/trump-i-purposely-called-apple-ceo-tim-cook-tim-apple/">had purposely condensed Cook’s name</a> to “Tim Apple” as “an easy way to save time &amp; words.”</p>
