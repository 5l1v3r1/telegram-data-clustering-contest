      <p>The Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission Thursday submitted a report to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath proposing a new law to check on forcible conversions in the state.</p>
      <p>“The report was submitted along with draft legislation, Uttar Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill, 2019,” the commission’s secretary Sapna Tripathi told news agency PTI.</p>
      <p>The report, which was prepared after going through pre and post-independence laws in the country, said that the matter is of serious concern.</p>
      <p>“The commission is of the view that existing legal provisions are not enough to check religious conversion and on this serious matter, a new law is needed like in 10 other states,” the report read.</p>
      <p>It added that the 10 states — namely Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand — had enforced special laws that ban conversions by force, fraud, marriage, or allurement.</p>
      <p>The report also added that it was drawn up after looking at neighbouring countries like Nepal, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, besides keeping in mind court judgments.</p>
      <p>The 268-page report included newspaper clippings of recent cases regarding forcible conversions, international covenants on the right to religion, and anti-conversion laws in India and its neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>The report also states the constitutional framework of the right to freedom in India, anti-conversion laws in various states of the country, along with a comparative study, recommendations of the law commission of India and extracts from important Supreme Court and High Court judgments, besides proceedings of the UP Legislative Assembly.</p>
