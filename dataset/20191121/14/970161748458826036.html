      <p>Disturbing footage shows the aftermath of a police officer flooring a woman called Christmas Carol after telling her to stop blowing kisses to passing cars.</p>
      <p>Carol, whose real name is Carol Christensen, also suffered a dislocated shoulder after her arms were yanked behind her back by the cop in South Lake Tahoe, California.</p>
      <p>Monday’s incident began when the cop ordered Christmas Carol – who is well known for waving and blowing kisses to locals – to stop what she was doing.</p>
      <p>The situation escalated when she refused to do so, with eyewitness Jessica Barackman’s video of Carol laying on the ground sparking fury online.</p>
      <p>Barackman told <a href="https://gooddaysacramento.cbslocal.com/2019/11/20/police-handcuff-detain-carol-christmas-tahoe/">CBS13</a>: ‘I was like sick to my stomach that they would hurt her like that.</p>

      <p>South Lake Tahoe Police have since released bodycam footage they say vindicates their officer’s conduct.</p>
      <p>He can be heard telling Christmas Carol ‘You need to get out of the road… you’re going to get hurt.’</p>
      <p>She responds: ‘Stop ordering people around.’</p>

      <p>Cops say their footage shows Christmas Carol was asked to get back on the sidewalk 13 times before the situation escalated.</p>
      <p>They say she was taken into custody ‘for her own safety’ before being given a citation and released.</p>
