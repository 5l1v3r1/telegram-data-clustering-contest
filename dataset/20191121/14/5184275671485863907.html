      <p>In a recent episode of The Kapil Sharma Show, comedian Kapil revealed that his first salary was <b>Rs 1500,</b> which he got for working at a cloth printing factory, the report revealed.</p>
      <p>Actress Kavita Kaushik, on the other hand, took up her first job while in college. “I hosted a show for a channel and was paid Rs 1,500 for a day’s work. They had canned five episodes with me. I handed the money over to my mother,” she said.</p>
      <p>Actress Shikha Singh recalled that she got <b>Rs 50,000</b> eight years ago for the show Salaam Zindagi, even after her episodes were scrapped. “This happened right after I finished college. I had come to Mumbai for a show I auditioned for, but I never got paid for it.</p>
