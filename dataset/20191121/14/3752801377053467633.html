      <h1>Healthy baby boy for Cape Town Shoprite cashier who was assaulted while pregnant</h1>

      <p>Shoprite cashier Zimkhitha Xhalabile gave birth to a healthy baby boy last month.</p>
      <p>Xhalabile was eight-months pregnant when she was <a href="https://www.groundup.org.za/article/customer-assaults-pregnant-shoprite-cashier/">assaulted by a male customer</a> at her till in September, <a href="https://www.groundup.org.za/article/healthy-baby-shoprite-cashier-who-was-assaulted-while-pregnant/">GroundUp reported</a>.</p>
      <p>She had just closed her till in the Shoprite in Broadway Mall, Lwandle, on September 9, when a customer demanded to be assisted.</p>
      <p>At first, she said, she argued with the customer, telling him to use another till, but when he became aggressive, she decided to assist him.</p>
      <p>The two exchanged words and the customer punched Xhalabile. The incident was recorded on the CCTV cameras. The man has made a brief appearance at the Strand Magistrate's Court.</p>
      <p>"The court wanted us to reconcile, but he has not shown any sign of remorse. He has not tried to apologise or asked to speak to my family. I would have considered dropping the case if he tried showing remorse. I want the case to carry on," said Xhalabile.</p>
      <p>She is currently on maternity leave and is expected back at work in April next year.</p>
      <p>"I am happy that nothing happened to my child. That was one of my worries, even after doctors assured me nothing was wrong."</p>
