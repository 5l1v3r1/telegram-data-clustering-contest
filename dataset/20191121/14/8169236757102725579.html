        <b>Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has pledged his allegiance to manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer calling him “the best man for the job”.</b>

      <p>After being appointed permanent manager back in March, Solskjaer has struggled to oversee a significant improvement, winning only four out of twelve league games this season.</p>

      <p>With Mauricio Pochettino now available, many believe it is just a matter of time until the former Spurs boss throws his name into the hat for a possible job at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Despite their lack of form and outside pressure, Rashford has told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/11866087/marcus-rashford-backs-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-no-one-better-for-manchester-united">Sky Sports</a> that he doesn’t believe that there is anyone else better placed than Solskjaer to continue to lead Man Utd forward, as seen in the video below.</p>
      <p>Man Utd face Sheffield Utd on Sunday hoping to continue to climb the table and to keep themselves in contention for a top-four finish this season in the Premier League.</p>
