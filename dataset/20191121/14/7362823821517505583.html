      <h1>Prehistoric snakes had limbs for 70M years, new study shows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:45:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Ciaccia</a></address>
      <p>Researchers have found <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/fossils">fossilized</a> evidence that snakes had limbs, as well as cheekbones, around 100 million years ago.</p>
      <p>The researchers looked at a "strikingly well-preserved" fossil of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/reptiles">snake</a> known as Najash rionegrina, discovered in Argentina. N. rionegrina has been named after the Biblical snake, Nahash, which tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden with forbidden fruit.</p>
      <p>“Our findings support the idea that the ancestors of modern snakes were big-bodied and big-mouthed— instead of small burrowing forms as previously thought,” explained the study's lead author, Fernando Garberoglio, in a <a href="https://mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/ancient-snakes-cheekbone-sheds-light-evolution-modern-snake-skulls-302723?utm_source=hootsuite&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=">statement</a>. “The study also reveals that early snakes retained their hindlimbs for an extended period of time before the origin of modern snakes which are for the most part, completely limbless.”</p>

      <p>Michael Caldwell, one of the study's co-authors, added that researchers have not been able to gather any significant information about the early evolution of snakes, due to a lack of fossils.</p>
      <p>“This research revolutionizes our understanding of the jugal bone in snake and non-snake lizards,” Caldwell, a professor at the University of Alberta, added. “After 160 years of getting it wrong, this paper corrects this very important feature based not on guesswork, but on empirical evidence.”</p>
      <p>The researchers performed CT scans to visualize the skull structures inside the specimen, looking at pathways for nerves and blood vessels, as well as the entire skeletal structure.</p>
      <p>“This research is critical to understanding the evolution of the skulls of modern and ancient snakes,” added Caldwell.</p>
