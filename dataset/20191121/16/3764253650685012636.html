      <p>The PDP lawmakers made their position regarding the elections known on Wednesday, November 20, at a news conference in Abuja.</p>
      <p>It was reported that the candidates of the APC in Bayelsa and Kogi won the gubernatorial elections according to INEC’s announcements.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the senators, the minority leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, said they were disturbed by the elections.</p>
      <p>Ababribe said they rejected the elections because the results announced by INEC did not reflect what actually happened on the field.</p>
      <p>Also the candidate of the PDP in the Kogi <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276553-kogi-election-pdp-candidate-musa-wada-rejects-results.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=rads">governorship election, Musa Wada, had rejected results </a>released by INEC on the election before the final announcement of the results.</p>
      <p>Wada had on Sunday, November 17, alleged that the results released were doctored to favour Governor <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/governor-yahaya-bello.html">Yahaya Bello</a> of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>
