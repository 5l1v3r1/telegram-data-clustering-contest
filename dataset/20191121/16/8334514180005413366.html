      <p>Netanyahu, 70, denies all wrongdoing but now finds himself stuck in political and legal limbo. He has failed to put together a government after two inconclusive elections this year, and now faces a legal process that could drag on for years. Following is a guide to the criminal cases against him:</p>
      <h3>WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST NETANYAHU?</h3>
      <p>Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit announced that he has filed criminal charges against Netanyahu in investigations listed as cases 1000, 2000 and 4000.</p>
      <p>CASE 1000 centers on allegations that Netanyahu and his wife Sara wrongfully received gifts from Arnon Milchan, a prominent Hollywood producer and Israeli citizen, and Australian billionaire businessman James Packer. Those gifts allegedly included champagne and cigars. He has been charged with fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>CASE 2000 alleges that Netanyahu negotiated a deal with the owner of Israel’s best-selling daily newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, for better coverage. In return, prosecutors say, he offered legislation that would slow the growth of a rival daily newspaper. In this case Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>CASE 4000 alleges that Netanyahu granted regulatory favors to Israel’s leading telecommunications company, Bezeq Telecom Israel (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BEZQ.TA">BEZQ.TA</a>), in return for positive coverage of him and his wife on a news website controlled by the company’s former chairman. Netanyahu has been charged with bribery, as well as fraud and breach of trust, in this case.</p>
      <h3>WHAT DOES NETANYAHU SAY?</h3>
      <p>Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a politically orchestrated “witch-hunt” by the media and the left to oust him from office.</p>
      <p>Loyalists in Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party have accused the Israeli justice system of bias, and Netanyahu himself has argued that receiving gifts from friends was not against the law.</p>
      <p>His legal team says criminal probes into the relations between politicians and the news media would be a threat to a free press, a central pillar of any democracy.</p>
      <h3>WILL A TRIAL BEGIN SOON?</h3>
      <p>Unlikely. It could take many months before the cases are brought before the court. Netanyahu could also seek a plea deal rather than stand trial.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu’s allies in parliament, the Knesset, have said they would push to grant him parliamentary immunity from prosecution. But with Israeli politics in unprecedented turmoil, it is unclear whether such a move is even possible.</p>
      <h3>COULD HE GO TO JAIL, IF CONVICTED?</h3>
      <p>Bribery charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in jail and/or a fine. Fraud and breach of trust carry a prison sentence of up to three years.</p>
      <h3>WILL THERE BE POLITICAL FALLOUT?</h3>
      <p>Netanyahu has dominated Israeli politics for more than a decade. But both he and his main centrist rival Benny Gantz have failed to form a government after two elections, in April and September, leaving the country in political and economic stasis.</p>
      <p>If there is no political breakthrough in the next three weeks, Israel will face yet another election, which few want.</p>
      <p>If he is still in office as prime minister after that, Netanyahu would be under no strict legal obligation to quit. According to Israeli law, a prime minister must step down if ultimately convicted, but can stay in office throughout legal proceedings, including appeals.</p>
      <p>It is unclear if allies - who have mostly remained loyal - will continue to stick by him.</p>
      <p>Some may see it as a chance to emerge from beneath the shadow of a man who has been at or near the summit of Israeli politics for a generation, and who enjoys an international profile like no other Israeli politician.</p>
