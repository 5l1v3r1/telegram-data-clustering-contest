      <p><b>At the resumed hearing,</b> Oyedepo informed the court that all requirements for final forfeiture had been met. He, therefore, requested that the court should grant the application for final forfeiture because there was no opposition to the request from anybody.</p>
      <p><b>More details: </b>Having listened to Oyedepo’s appeal, Justice Aikawa ordered that the sum of N280.5 million in two Zenith Bank accounts Nos 3341692012 and 1013714256 be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p>
