      <h1>Red Bull performs incredible F1 pit-stop at zero gravity</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:00:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p>Red Bull holds the world record for the fastest pit-stop in a Formula One race -- it can now boast the first pit-stop performed in zero gravity conditions.</p>
      <p>The former world champions took its 2005 F1 car to an altitude of 33,000 feet on board an Ilyushin Il-76 MDK cosmonaut training plane, drawing on the help of Russian space agency Roscosmos. Car equipment was carefully secured before and after each weightless period.</p>
      <p>When the car was worked on at zero-gravity, car and mechanics floated at around a metre off the ground. Last weekend Red Bull broke its own record for an F1 pit-stop, with its car stationary for a lightning fast 1.82s -- each filming session at zero-gravity was limited to 15 seconds.</p>

      <p>A Red Bull release said: "Over the course of a week, pit crew members took a crash course in cosmonaut training in preparation for multiple Zero-G flights in the plane's fuselage along with the F1 car and a 10-strong film crew. Each flight consisted of a series of parabolas, with the aircraft climbing at a 45 degree angle, then falling in a ballistic arc, to produce a period of weightlessness of around 22 seconds before the next climb."</p>
