      <h1>How Chelsea could line up against Manchester City</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> make the trip to the Etihad Stadium to face <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> having put together a six-match winning streak in the Premier League.</h2>

      <p>Recording maximum points since September 28 has moved the Blues into third position in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">standings</a>, one point ahead of Saturday's opponents.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a> is preparing for the game in the north-west with a number of issues remaining in the treatment room, as well as having a dilemma over which formation to use for one of their toughest tests of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> predicts how Chelsea could line up for the showdown with the top-flight champions.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ruben-loftus-cheek/"><b>Ruben Loftus-Cheek</b></a> (Achilles), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonio-rudiger/"><b>Antonio Rudiger</b></a> (groin),<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ross-barkley/"><b>Ross Barkley</b></a> (ankle), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-pulisic/"><b>Christian Pulisic</b></a> (hip)</p>
      <p>While Lampard has frequently used one creative midfielder as part of a three-man combination this season, the Englishman may instead opt to use <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jorginho/"><b>Jorginho</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ngolo-kante/"><b>N'Golo Kante</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mateo-kovacic/"><b>Mateo Kovacic</b></a> for a game of this magnitude.</p>
      <p>Should Lampard decide on that approach, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mason-mount/"><b>Mason Mount</b></a> may drop down to the substitutes' bench, providing that Christian Pulisic has shaken off a hip injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cesar-azpilicueta/"><b>Cesar Azpilicueta</b></a> was rested for the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/result/result-tammy-abrahams-10th-premier-league-goal-of-campaign-sees-chelsea-past-palace_378440.html">2-0 win over Crystal Palace</a> before the international break, but the Spaniard should get the nod over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/reece-james/"><b>Reece James</b></a> for this match.</p>
      <p>Despite <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-christensen/"><b>Andreas Christensen</b></a> returning to full fitness, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kurt-zouma/"><b>Kurt Zouma</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fikayo-tomori/"><b>Fikayo Tomori</b></a> are expected to keep their places in the centre of the backline.</p>
      <p>Ross Barkley may feature in the squad after an ankle problem, although the playmaker is only likely to make the bench.</p>
