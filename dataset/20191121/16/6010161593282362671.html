      <p>Through a bit of trickery with the O2 Black Friday sale, you can get yourself a brand new Apple iPhone XR for just £329.</p>
      <p>Annoyingly, you need to put in a little bit of legwork to get this deal. I think you’ll find it’s totally worth it for the £300 you’ll end up saving on the iPhone XR, though!</p>
      <p>To begin with, you’ll need to take yourself over to the <a href="https://www.o2.co.uk/shop/apple/iphone-xr">64GB iPhone XR page in the O2 Shop</a>. From there, in the Pay Monthly tab, you need to click on the link to ‘See our plans’. Now, scroll down to the bottom of the page where you can choose to pay for your device in full. From the new list of tariffs that appears, choose the 1GB on for £21 per month.</p>
      <p>Now that’s out of the way, you just have to speak to O2 to cancel your contract within the 14-day cooling-off period and the iPhone XR will be yours for just £329. From there, you can choose to pick up another better SIM-only deal or stick with your existing contract. Easy!</p>
      <p>To make the deal even sweeter, you’ll get a one-year Apple TV subscription completely free with your purchase too. Overall, it represents some serious savings, so be sure to take advantage of this Black Friday iPhone deal before it ends on 4th December.</p>
