      <p><b><a href="http://homedepot.sjv.io/c/196318/456723/8154?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FWhirlpool-Front-Control-Built-in-Tall-Tub-Dishwasher-in-Monochromatic-Stainless-Steel-with-1-Hour-Wash-Cycle-55-dBA-WDF520PADM%2F205506225">1. Whirlpool Front Control Stainless Steel Dishwasher, $328 (originally $579)</a> [You save $251]</b> Fellow Home Depot shoppers love this dishwasher, which is currently more than 40% off. A notable feature that nearly everyone mentions is how quiet it is (55 dBA), so you can run the dishwasher at any time of the night without disturbing anyone. It also features an efficient one-hour wash cycle and a smart soil sensor that can adjust the cycle based on how dirty your dishes are.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://homedepot.sjv.io/c/196318/456723/8154?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FGE-1-7-cu-ft-Over-the-Range-Microwave-with-Sensor-Cooking-in-Stainless-Steel-JVM6175SKSS%2F207025738&amp;amp;subid2=1573748625459a014217ox">2. GE 1.7 cu. ft. Over the Range Microwave, $218 (originally $399)</a> [You save $181]</b> The sleek and compact microwave comes in six finishes, though you might want to get one of the lighter colors if you want to read the control panel easily. The special melt feature lets you melt things like butter and chocolate without making a mess, and you have the option to activate or deactivate the turntable. Other settings you can adjust include light brightness, fan speed, and beeper volume.</p>

Maytag 5.3 cu. ft. High-Efficiency White Top Load Washing Machine, $648 (originally $999)</a> [You save $351] </b>Depending on how long you’ve had your old washer, using this washing machine can involve a bit of a learning curve. However, the payoff is worth it. The wash basket is very large and handles 11 different wash cycles, including a PowerWash cycle that tackles especially tough stains.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://homedepot.sjv.io/c/196318/456723/8154?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2Fsets%2Fappliances%2Fpackage%2FSamsungStainlessSteelPackageWithFingerprintResistant%2Fpackage_1073">4. Samsung Stainless Steel Package, $3,122 (originally $5,006)</a> [You save $1,884]</b> Replace your kitchen appliances in one go with this package. The four appliances are a fridge, dishwasher, range with convection oven, and a microwave, all made with durable stainless steel. The high-tech fridge is WiFi and Bixby-enabled so you can monitor its temperature from anywhere.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://homedepot.sjv.io/c/196318/456723/8154?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FDyson-Ball-Total-Clean-with-Extra-Tools-253424-01%2F307270379">5. Dyson Ball Total Clean Vacuum, $424(originally $624)</a> [You save $200]</b> Dyson’s cordless stick vacuum designs (and prices) aren’t for everyone. The ball part of this vacuum increases stability and control, though the trade-off is that the vacuum is slightly heavier than other models. In typical Dyson fashion, it’s powerful, thorough, and clean – the HEPA filtration traps allergens and bacteria inside the vacuum.</p>
      <p><b>6.</b> <b><a href="http://homedepot.sjv.io/c/196318/456723/8154?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FGorilla-Ladders-47-25-in-x-12-in-x-20-in-Aluminum-Slim-Fold-Work-Platform-with-300-lbs-Load-Capacity-GLWP-47%2F305590237">Gorilla Ladders Aluminum Slim-Fold Work Platform, $24.88 (originally $72)</a> [You save $47.12]</b> A sturdy and durable work platform is one of the most versatile tools you can own. The standing area is nearly 4 feet long and has a 300-pound load capacity, but the platform ultimately folds down to a slim 3.25 inches. Reviews from home DIYers are overwhelmingly positive.</p>
