      <h1>Club offer €4m a season to Chelsea player ahead of next window – Waiting on decision</h1>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.asistanaliz.com/futbol/pedro-fenerbahce">Turkish website Asist Analiz</a>, Fenerbahce are interested in signing Chelsea winger Pedro in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month we covered reports from Turkey that the Spaniard is a transfer target for the Yellow Canaries, and Asist Analiz now report Fenerbahce are looking to sign him in January to bolster their title chances.</p>
      <p>The 32 year old, whose contract with Chelsea will expire at the end of the season, is said to be looking to leave the London side following a lack of game time under Frank Lampard this campaign.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed Fener have offered €4m a season to the former Barcelona player and are currently waiting on his decision.</p>
      <p>If they can reach an agreement with Pedro, Asist Analiz say Fenerbahce are confident they can get the player as they believe they will be able to convince Chelsea over his transfer fee.</p>
      <p>Pedro has made eight appearances for the Premier League side in all competitions this season, scoring one goal.</p>
