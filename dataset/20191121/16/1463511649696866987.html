      <h1>Former Italy and Juventus footballer Marchisio turns to journalism</h1>

      <p>Claudio Marchisio, a celebrated former midfielder for Juventus and the Italian national team, has turned to journalism, debuting Thursday as a columnist for Corriere della Sera daily.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old has become a contributor to Corriere Torino, the local news section for Turin, the north-eastern city where Marchisio and Juventus are based.</p>
      <p>His first column was not about football, he instead penned a heartfelt tribute to Silvia Romano, an Italian charity worker who was abducted in Kenya a year ago and has been missing.</p>
      <p>On Instagram, Marchisio said he accepted the Corriere Torino gig partly to be able to tell Francesca and Enzo, #SilviaRomano’s parents, that my thoughts are with them.</p>
      <p>“They must know that they are not alone and that Silvia is also our daughter, our sister, our friend of whom we are proud,’’ Marchisio added.</p>
      <p>Marchisio played for Juventus for most of his playing career, winning seven Serie, A titles with the Italian giants.</p>
      <p>He retired in October after a final season with Russian club Zenit St Petersburg.</p>
