      <p>When I had children I became the mistress of bung-it-in-the-oven dishes. I didn’t want to brown food, or layer and titivate. I just wanted the oven to do the work. I still make this kind of food more than any other.</p>
      <p>Try this one-dish sausage recipe that only requires 10 minutes of hands on work, then let the oven do all the rest. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 50 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>8 chunky sausages</li>
        <li>2 tart apples, halved (no need to peel or core)</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, peeled and cut into 6 wedges</li>
        <li>2 sprigs of rosemary</li>
        <li>3½ tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>200ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>125g blackberries</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190C/ 170C fan/Gas 5.</li>
        <li>Tumble the sausages, apples, onions and rosemary into a roasting tin or shallow casserole dish (about 30cm across), where they can lie snugly in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Mix together the maple syrup, mustard, olive oil and garlic, then pour into the pan. Season and turn the ingredients to coat.</li>
        <li>Roast for 50 minutes, turning over the sausages once. They should be dark and glossy, with the apples completely soft.</li>
        <li>Put the tin or dish on the hob and add the stock. Bring almost to the boil, stirring to help the maple and mustard mix with the stock. Add the blackberries to heat through and serve with mashed or baked potatoes.</li>
