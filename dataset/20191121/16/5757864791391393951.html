      <p>Depending on where you live, paying off your parking tickets could be a chance to give back to the underserved members of your community this holiday season. Towns, cities, and universities across the country are embracing food for fines programs: initiatives that allow residents to settle their parking debts by donating non-perishable food items.</p>
      <p>Accepting canned goods in lieu of cash parking ticket payments isn't a new practice. <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71246/kentucky-city-letting-residents-pay-parking-tickets-canned-goods">Lexington, Kentucky</a> has been running holiday food for fines drives since 2013. Even in larger cities, like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/586718/las-vegas-nevada-drivers-pay-parking-violations-with-school-supplies">Las Vegas</a>, such programs have proven successful. Recently in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/592283/muncie-indiana-let-residents-pay-parking-tickets-animal-shelter-donations">Muncie, Indiana</a>, the local police department used it as an opportunity to collect pet supplies instead of pantry staples.</p>
      <p>The model has become more popular in recent years, and this holiday season, it will be easier than ever to find a food for fines program near you. In <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/parking-tickets-canned-goods-police-offer-pay-parking-tickets-with-canned-food-donations/1009797696">Bay Village</a>, Ohio, a city located about 15 miles west of Cleveland, officials are looking for non-perishables to provide to the local Bay Food Ministry. Individual items are worth $5 in owed parking fines, with the town waiving up to $25 per person.</p>
      <p>Universities are also hopping on board the trend. At the <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/front-range/boulder/cu-boulder-students-can-trade-in-canned-foods-for-their-parking-fines">University of Colorado Boulder</a>, students can donate five items to have their parking tickets forgiven. Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania has already collected more than <a href="https://www.pahomepage.com/top-stories/helping-the-need-with-food-for-fines/">100 cans</a> from students through its own food for fines program.</p>
      <p>Many of the initiatives will run through this Friday and conclude ahead of Thanksgiving week, so if you have a parking ticket you need to pay off, contact your local parking services office soon to see if it's participating.</p>
