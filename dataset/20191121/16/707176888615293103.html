      <h2>Employees will embrace innovation if they feel they are in control of new technologies</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:01:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author">Gillian Tett</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year, researchers at <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6d0c5544-0afb-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">Uber</a>, the ride-hailing group, set about addressing a fundamental question: how do humans really interact with computers?</p>
      <p>They conducted ethnographic research into Uber drivers’ reactions to a new computerised voice-activated system, using fly-on-the-wall real life observations. The results were thought-provoking.</p>
      <p>When Uber drivers liked the tone of the computerised voice and — most crucially — felt able to pause the voice-activated commands at will, they embraced the technology and the efficiencies it produced. Otherwise, they shunned it.</p>
      <p>“We had to make sure that the drivers could interrupt the voice . . . and the persona did not sound snarky,” Jake Silva, a researcher, told an Ethnographic Praxis in Industry conference last week, noting that Uber is now installing a drivers’ “barge-in” feature as a result.</p>
      <p>This is symbolic. Today there is a great deal of hand-wringing about the threats posed by robots to human dignity and work. And no wonder. Six years ago, <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf">Oxford university economists</a> caused a stir by predicting that 47 per cent of US jobs are “at risk [from robots], ie could be automated relatively soon”. Subsequent analysis has repeated such predictions. Moreover, as studies by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages">McKinsey</a>, the consultancy, have pointed out, this process will hit vulnerable communities particularly hard.</p>
      <p>However another aspect to this story is often ignored: digital innovation will create jobs too. McKinsey thinks this <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ab94fb30-cea2-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6">job creation</a> could be so significant that predictions of future mass unemployment are wrong. And the ethnographers researching workplace trends are finding a similarly complex pattern.</p>
      <p>Take Google. In the last year the company has scurried to develop artificial intelligence tools for offices workers, called “GSuite” products. But when Google researchers recently conducted ethnographic research they noticed something important: modern office workers tend to make a mental distinction between “core” work (or jobs they “identify with”) and “periphery” work “that does not contribute to their success or happiness”.</p>
      <p>Office workers will readily use AI to replace peripheral work. But they resist this for core jobs.</p>
      <p>This insight is now “inform[ing] strategic decisions on how AI is integrated by GSuite, Google researchers said. One AI size does not fit all.</p>
      <p>The consultancy <a href="https://www.redassociates.com/">ReD Associates</a> recently studied how AI displaces work at a management consultancy and found a similar pattern. Separately, ReD ethnographers also observed the impact of AI and digitisation on French medical workers and American insurance salesmen and found that workers are “taking measures to protect the future of their livelihoods” in unexpectedly creative ways. Medical device technicians are rebranding themselves as therapeutic providers of “patient care”; insurance salesmen are redefining themselves as “risk consultants”.</p>
      <p>“When making predictions about future unemployment as a result of automation . . . it is not enough . . . to simply calculate the percentage of cognitive or manual tasks within a given job that could theoretically . . . be accomplished by a computer,” the ReD team concludes. “Such predictions do not take into account the new value that workers are creating to stay competitive.”</p>
      <p>Researchers at Nissan’s autonomous vehicle laboratory agree. “We should not associate automation only with humans being tossed ‘out’ of the technical loop at work,” they said. They showed how Nissan executives have discovered that “automated technologies”, such as <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/a3867483-5d05-4683-b572-b3e3415c8029">driverless cars</a>, “do in fact need human workers” to develop, market and monitor them.</p>
      <p>Such findings will not ease the pain of those humans who have already been displaced by robots. Nor will it mitigate the political upheaval fuelled by the fact that displacement tends to increase inequality. And it is still almost impossible to find good data that measures how the pattern of job creation and destruction is balancing out.</p>
      <p>Policymakers and economists need to focus on both sides of this equation. They must also encourage interaction between the computational scientists who are developing these technologies and the social scientists measuring their impact.</p>
      <p>The real lesson of Uber’s “barge-in” button is that when workers feel they have a modicum of control, they will embrace innovation and the efficiencies it brings. Without that sense of control, there is a risk of backlash. Investors in technology stocks should take note.</p>
