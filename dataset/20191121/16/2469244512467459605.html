      <p>A merger between two Devon hospice charities has been described as “a perfect fit” to continue the shared values of each organisation.</p>
      <p>Exmouth and Lympstone Hospiscare and Hospiscare Exeter, Mid and East Devon have announced a merger of their organisations. </p>
      <p>The charity says that they are both focused on the same principles and that the amalgamation is a perfect fit to support the shared values. </p>
      <p>The charity aims to provide support and relief to people living with a life-limiting illness and those who are nearing the end of their lives - providing services to support the physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of those affected. </p>
      <p>The trustees of both charities believe that the merger will provide many benefits and aligns with aims to build a charity, which is best equipped to meet the increasing need for end of life care in Exmouth, Lympstone, Exeter, Mid and East Devon.</p>
      <p>Services and the centre at High View Gardens in Exmouth will continue as normal, and Exmouth &amp; Lympstone Hospiscare employees will transfer to Hospiscare (Exeter, Mid and East Devon).</p>

      <p>Dr Helen Enright, chairman of Exmouth and Lympstone Hospiscare, said: “I want to extend my thanks to all our supporters and amazing volunteers who have helped to shape the charity over the past 32 years. </p>
      <p>“Your efforts have enabled thousands of patients to be supported, and I hope you will all stay with us for this exciting next phase of the journey. My fellow Trustees and I believe this is the natural next step to ensure our future sustainability and deliver even more care for years to come.”</p>
      <p>Andrew Randall, Hospiscare (Exeter, Mid &amp; East Devon) interim chief executive officer added: “We care for people with any life-limiting illness from the age of 18 upwards. We have a growing and ageing population in our area of care - Exeter, East and Mid Devon. </p>
      <p>“That, coupled with more complex patient illnesses, means there are significant consequences for the provision of end of life care. Coming together with Exmouth &amp; Lympstone Hospiscare will enable us to support more patients and families at a time when they need us the most.”</p>

      <p>The merger will follow the Charity Commission Guidelines and was completed on October 31.</p>
      <p>Budleigh Salterton &amp; District Hospiscare continue to operate as a separate charity, raising funds to pay for Hospiscare (Exeter, Mid and East Devon) to deliver end of life care in its locality. There will be no changes in the services offered to patients, their families and carers in the Budleigh Salterton &amp; District Hospiscare area and the Hospiscare@Home service operating jointly with Exmouth &amp; Lympstone Hospiscare will be similarly unaffected.</p>
