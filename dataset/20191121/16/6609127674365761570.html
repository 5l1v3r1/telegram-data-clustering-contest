        <b>AN ATTRACTIVE care worker who engaged in sexual activity with a teenage boy she was supposed to be looking after has lost a bid to overturn her conviction.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kayleigh Martin, 27, met the 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, at a residential centre which offers support for troubled teenagers and young adults.</p>

      <p>They exchanged messages and began an 'inappropriate relationship' until the affair came to light and care home bosses called in police.</p>
      <p>Martin denied allegations of engaging in sexual activity while in a position of trust and sending a sexual communication as she went on trial at Lanark Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>She was convicted by Sheriff Nikola Stewart and in April was placed on the sex offenders register for two years.</p>
      <p>Martin was also banned from contacting the teenager and was ordered to perform 250 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old launched a bid to have the conviction overturned at the Sheriff Appeal Court in Edinburgh but that was thrown out before any full hearing could take place.</p>
      <p>Martin, of Hamilton, Lanarkshire, has now appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court where she was granted a further nine months to complete her unpaid work by Sheriff Vincent Smith.</p>
      <p>Ian Scott, defending, added: "Her appeal in this matter is at an end because it failed to make it through the sift stage.</p>
      <p>"We are asking the court to grant her an extension to allow her to complete the court order she was given."</p>
      <p>The Sheriff Appeal Court confirmed Martin's case had been refused at the 'second sift stage' of the appeal process.</p>
      <p>Sentencing her at a previous trial, Sheriff Stewart blasted Martin's 'appalling behaviour'.</p>
      <p>He said: "This was a serious relationship regardless of what she thought it was.</p>
      <p>"He is a young man who has an attractive, caring young woman who was giving him a highly unusual amount of attention and the warning bells should have been ringing much earlier.</p>
      <p>"I don't think she is predatory but is someone who is naive and foolish.</p>
      <p>"I have no doubt that this will have undoubted serious repercussions on his life and frankly this is a dreadful thing she has done.</p>
      <p>"The benefit of her education has now been entirely wasted.</p>
      <p>"I regard this appalling behaviour very seriously and can't say enough how worried I am about the repercussions of this on this young man's life."</p>
