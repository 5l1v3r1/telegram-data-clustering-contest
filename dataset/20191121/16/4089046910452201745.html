      <p><b>ENID, Okla. (AP) —</b> Officials at Vance Air Force Base in northwestern Oklahoma report a “mishap” with undefined casualties involving two jets at the base.</p>
      <p>The base says in a news release two T-38 Talons with two people on board each aircraft were taking part in a training mission when the mishap occurred shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>Television video from the scene showed one aircraft upside down in a grassy area off a runway and the second aircraft upright, farther down the runway.</p>
      <p>Airman Octavius Thompson told The Associated Press that the base would not comment beyond the release and declined to say if the casualties involved injuries or fatalities.</p>
      <p>The base is about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of Oklahoma City and according to its website the T-38 Talon is a twin-engine, high-altitude, supersonic jet used in a variety of jet pilot training roles.</p>
