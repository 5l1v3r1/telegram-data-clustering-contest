      <p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-major-players-timeline-what-comes-next-2019-11">impeachment inquiry</a> into President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a> has officially moved into its public phase, and witnesses are beginning to testify in open session before the House Intelligence Committee, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and House Oversight Committee, who are jointly pursuing the inquiry.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-takeaways-bill-taylor-george-kent-testimony-trump-impeachment-hearing-2019-11">the public phase of the inquiry kicked off</a> with the testimony of acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor and State Department official George Kent.</p>
      <p>The two diplomats <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-schedule-how-to-watch-live-updates-2019-11">corroborated previous witness testimony</a> that Trump and members of his administration used a $400 million military aid package to Ukraine as leverage to pressure its government to announce investigations that would be politically favorable to Trump.</p>
      <p>And on Friday, former US ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-yovanovitch-testimony-updates-2019-11">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, a career diplomat, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-yovanovitch-testimony-updates-2019-11">gave gripping testimony</a> detailing how Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed her out of her position earlier this year after over three decades of service in the State Department.</p>
      <p>Eight more diplomats and national security officials – many of whom have already appeared to testify behind closed-doors – <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/12/house-intel-announces-additional-witnesses-for-public-impeachment-hearings-000327">will testify publicly in the next few days.</a></p>
      <p>On Tuesday, State Department official and advisor to Vice President Mike Pence <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/politics/jennifer-williams-testify/index.html">Jennifer Williams</a> and Lt. Col. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/alexander-vindman">Alexander Vindman</a>, an expert on Eastern European affairs on the National Security Council publicly testified before the intelligence committee in the morning session, an former US special representative to Ukraine <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/kurt-volker">Kurt Volker</a> and former NSC staffer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-trump-aide-tim-morrison-joe-biden-ukraine-military-aid-2019-10">Tim Morrison</a> testified publicly in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, US ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> gave several hours of explosive testimony throughout the day where he said he believed a quid pro quo had occurred. Later that day, pentagon official <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pentagon-official-trump-ordered-ukraine-aid-frozen-2019-11">Laura Cooper</a> revealed bombshell that the staff had received two emails from the State Department on July 25 asking about US military aid to Ukraine, undermining President Trump’s defense.</p>
      <h3>Here’s the schedule of who is testifying in the next few days.</h3>
      <p>This schedule will be periodically updated as the Committees announce public testimony for more witnesses.</p>

            <b>Thursday, November 21:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Former NSC senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/fiona-hill">Fiona Hill</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/david-hale-holmes-transcripts-released/index.html">David Holmes</a>, a diplomat at the US embassy in Ukraine who previously was interviewed behind closed doors, will jointly testify on Thursday.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What comes next?</h3>
      <p>After two weeks of public hearings involving eight witnesses, it’s possible more are on the way. Several key intelligence officials, including several Trump cabinet members, have been named by witnesses as <a href="https://www.insider.com/gordon-sondland-confirm-quid-pro-quo-in-opening-statement-2019-11">possessing knowledge of supposed quid pro quos</a> between the Trump administration and the Ukranian government.</p>
      <p>In his opening statement, Ambassador Sondland directly named Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Energy Department Secretary Rick Perry, and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Also named in Sondland’s testimony was Vice President Mike Pence, who was subpoenaed by House Democrats on October 4. Pompeo and Perry were subpoenaed on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-all-trump-associates-officials-subpoena-impeachment-2019-10">September 27 and October 10 respectively. </a>Here’s a list of all the Trump associates <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-all-trump-associates-officials-subpoena-impeachment-2019-10">who have been subpoenaed.</a></p>
      <p>The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/why-trump-cant-stop-all-witnesses-from-testifying-in-congresss-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/11/823c9608-ec2f-11e9-85c0-85a098e47b37_story.html">reportedly directed officials to defy subpoena orders</a> and refuse to testify. Mulvaney, for example, has already said <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mick-mulvaney-will-not-file-impeachment-subpoena-lawsuit-will-defer-to-trump-for-guidance/">he would not agree to testify.</a></p>
      <p>Of those close to Trump posed to potentially testify, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/john-bolton-biggest-threat-trump-impeachment-inquiry-2019-11">none may be more damning</a> than former national security officer John Bolton. In a letter to Congrees, Bolton’s personal lawyer said Bolton was “personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony.” Bolton has had more one on one time with Trump than any of the witnesses so far, and according to a reprot from Axios, he takes copious notes, which may add legitimacy to any critical claims he may make against the president.</p>
      <p>The impeachment inquiry all started with an anonymous whistleblower’s complaint, turned over to Congress in early September, that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country” in the 2020 US election in a series of events culminating in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>The complaint specifically charged that Trump’s pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate alleged corruption from former Vice President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Joe Biden</a> and his son Hunter came days after he <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-ukraine-military-aid-phone-call-2019-9">withheld a nearly $400 million military-aid package to Ukraine</a> that Congress had already appropriated.</p>
      <p>The White House’s notes of the call confirm Trump brought up how the US does “a lot for Ukraine.” Immediately after, Trump asked Zelensky to do him a “favor, though” by investigating Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and was somehow in possession of a Democratic National Committee server.</p>
      <p>In the past month, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-what-we-know-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-2019-11">multiple diplomats and national security officials</a> have testified that Trump and Giuliani explicitly conditioned both releasing the aid and inviting Zelensky to a meeting at the White House on Ukraine putting out at a statement announcing investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election.</p>
