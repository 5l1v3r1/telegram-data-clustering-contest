      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:55:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Charles Tawiah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Agogo (Ash), Nov 20, GNA - Alhaji Adams Sulley, a  teacher, on Monday, picked nomination forms to contest the Asante Akyem North Constituency Parliamentary seat in the upcoming National Democratic Congress (NDC) Primaries.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Sulley, also the Manager of the Asempa Radio, a local F.M Radio station at Asante Akyem Agogo, assured the Party’s Constituency Executives and the entire membership of his commitment to work assiduously to snatch the seat from the New Patriotic Party (NDC), if he is selected, after the vetting process.</p>
      <p>Mr Ibrahim Seidu, the Constituency Chairman, announced that the Party office was still opened for interested applicants to pick forms ahead of the close of nominations by the end of the week.</p>
      <p>He said vetting and selection of a candidate would commence next week and called for unity among the rank and file of the Party, since that remained their only key to wrest power from the ruling NPP government.</p>
