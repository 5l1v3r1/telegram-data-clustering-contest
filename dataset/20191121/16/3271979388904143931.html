      <h1>Bradley Cooper ‘Life As A Single Dad’ Cover Story Is Tabloid Fiction</h1>

      <p><b>Bradley Cooper</b> is featured on the cover of one of this week’s tabloids in a story about his “life as a single dad.” The details of the report didn’t come from anyone who actually knows the actor. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can confirm that the outlet has no knowledge about Cooper’s personal life, despite trying to make it seem like it has an “exclusive” scoop.</p>
      <p>This week’s issue of <i><b>Life &amp; Style</b></i> largely focuses on Cooper’s relationship with his two-year-old daughter, whom he shares with ex Irina Shayk. There are countless quotes from an anonymous “source” who breaks down how the actor spends time with his little girl. One of these alleged revelations is that he takes her on “long walks” around New York City. Considering that the paparazzi frequently photograph such outings, that’s hardly information only an “insider” would know. Other details include reasonable guesses, such as Cooper taking the little girl to school, playdates and doctor’s appointments. There’s not a single tidbit that wouldn’t apply to just about every father and daughter.</p>
      <p>This same “source” also pretends to have insight into why Cooper’s relationship with Irina Shayk ended, accusing the actor of being “more focused on his career and himself.” Are we to believe the magazine’s “insider” is someone so close to Cooper that they know all the details of his relationship with his two-year-old, but they’re also willing to trash-talk him to a tabloid?</p>
      <p>The publication proves itself even more unreliable by insisting Cooper had a “failed romance” with Lady Gaga following his split from Shayk. As <b>Gossip Cop</b> has stressed countless times, and as Gaga herself recently confirmed, the <i>A Star Is Born</i> co-stars have never been romantically involved.</p>
      <p>From there, the unknown tipster purports to know the status of Cooper’s love life, claiming his dating pool consists of “single moms at his local cafe,” in addition to other women he meets outside of the Hollywood scene. The seemingly nonexistent source adds, “If he doesn’t meet someone through work, it’ll be through one of [his daughter’s] playgroups. Bradley’s slowly getting back onto the dating scene. One of his buddy’s wives set him up with someone. It went well, but it wasn’t a love match.”</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> reached out to an individual close to Cooper, who tells us the actor “isn’t quietly dating” and “isn’t picking up moms” either. The publication’s cover story reads more like fan fiction than anything resembling journalism.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth noting, the inside of the magazine includes paparazzi shots of Cooper and his daughter, including one of them riding the subway together and another of the two on a carousel at Disneyland. These pictures were sneakily shot without the actor’s awareness, and <b>Gossip Cop</b> already called out several outlets last month for sharing <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/bradley-cooper-daughter-privacy-public-appearance/">unauthorized photos of Cooper and his daughter</a> at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. <i>Life &amp; Style</i> is invading the actor’s privacy yet again.</p>
      <p>Of course, we’re not surprised by the tabloid’s bogus report. Earlier this month, the outlet made up a story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-romance-fizzles-tears/">Gaga being heartbroken after her “romance” with Cooper fizzled</a>. There was no “romance” to speak of and the magazine doesn’t seem to have any real “source” close to the singer either. As for Cooper, the actor is very private when it comes to his personal life, and you won’t learn any actual scoops about the actor in the latest issue of <i>Life &amp; Style</i>.</p>
