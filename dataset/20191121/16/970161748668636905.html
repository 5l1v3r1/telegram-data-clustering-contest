      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> was concerned about how his time at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> ended and was privately asking people why he went wrong at Old Trafford, according to Darren Fletcher.</p>
      <p>After being sacked by Manchester United nearly a year ago, Mourinho has now replaced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> following his surprise sacking by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s time at Old Trafford ended on a sour note following bust-ups with several players including Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial, which has led to questions about his man-management style at Spurs.</p>
      <p>But Fletcher, who made over 340 appearances for United, has revealed that Mourinho was worried about how he was perceived at Old Trafford and is keen to not make the same mistakes at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>‘I think we’ll see a slightly different Jose,’ Fletcher told BBC Five Live.</p>

      <p>‘I think the Jose that had been affected by Real Madrid and almost resentment of players, different to the Jose of Porto, Chelsea and Inter Milan where he was a player’s manager, players were ‘us against the world’, there was a real closeness and things like that, we haven’t seen that for a while.</p>

      <p>‘I know for a fact after he left United he did a little bit of reflecting and asked a few people, ‘tell me the truth, tell me what I was like, give it to me straight’.</p>
      <p>‘And that’s, for me, a sign of somebody who realised he’d gone a little bit too far in that way.</p>
      <p>‘I’m sure he had his own frustrations towards Manchester United, just as many as the players and people had with him and the things that went on towards the end. I think you can see it from both point of views.</p>
      <p>‘But the fact he was asking people for an honest opinion of what he was like says to me that’s somebody who is reflecting and a little bit of a rest and a little bit of self-reflecting we’ll see a different Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>‘Whether it’s the Jose Mourinho of old… I don’t expect it to be the Jose we’ve seen in the last couple of years.’</p>
      <p>Asked if Spurs were right to sack Pochettino, Fletcher replied: ‘Yes because I feel like he’d run his course at Spurs.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like too much has gone on. I saw it coming at the beginning of the season, all the contract situations with the players, losing the Champions League final and the affect that’s had on them.</p>

      <p>‘The players are hearing the same messages all the time, same formation, it just seems to be everyone has lost their way, players, manager, everyone associated with the club.</p>

      <p>‘I feel Tottenham need a restart, somebody to come in and kick-start their season and take them on the next part of their journey.</p>
      <p>‘I just feel it’s a case of the manager having done five successful seasons at the club without winning a trophy, made Spurs an established Champions League side, taking them to the final, the one question mark against him is the fact he’s not won anything and Daniel Levy said that in his comments ‘we’ve brought in a winner’, so he obviously thinks the next challenge for Spurs is to start winning titles.’</p>
