      <p>At this time there are 17 regions, 40 municipalities, 12 towns and 160 villages in <b>Bulgaria</b> where the water supply is broken. A total of 315,000 people are experiencing <b>water rationing</b>, announced Deputy Minister of Regional Development and Public Works <b>Nikolay Nankov</b> in parliament, <a href="http://bnr.bg/en/post/101194688/315000-people-in-bulgaria-affected-by-water-rationing">BNR</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The biggest towns affected by <b>water rationing</b> are Lovech, Teteven, Pleven, Pernik, Dobrich, Kotel and Omurtag. Deputy Minister Nankov pointed out that the state should turn its attention to a maximum degree of European fund absorption and the effective use of public resources for the rehabilitation of the water supply system which, in most cases, was constructed 50-60 years ago. Unless new dams are built and old ones rehabilitated, <b>Bulgaria</b> will face a serious crisis in the long term connected with the normal supply of drinking water to a large portion of the population, <b>Nikolay Nankov</b> said. </p>
