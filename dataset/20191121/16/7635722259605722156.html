        <b>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been indicted on corruption charges, the country's attorney-general has announced.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The charges include bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>It raises further uncertainty over the political future of a country heading towards a third election in less than a year.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu, who has denied wrongdoing in three corruption cases, is under no obligation to resign after being charged.</p>
      <p>The allegations include suspicions that he accepted hundreds of thousands of euro worth of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends - and offered to trade favours with a newspaper publisher.</p>
      <p>He has also been accused of using his influence to help a wealthy telecoms magnate in exchange for favourable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>He has previously dismissed the investigations into him as a "witch hunt".</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu has been prime minister there since 2009, but has failed to form a government after a trio of public votes.</p>
      <p>Opposition leader Benny Gantz was also unable to secure a coalition.</p>
      <p>The current situation is that the Israeli parliament has less than three weeks to nominate any of its 120 lawmakers to try and establish a coalition, otherwise another election will be triggered within 90 days.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/netanyahu-fails-secure-majority-israeli-election-exit-polls-905549">Previous ballots</a></b> this year have been held in April and September.</p>
      <p>Despite his recent troubles, Mr Netanyahu remains leader of the Likud Party.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old is the longest-serving leader in Israel, having first served from June 1996 until July 1999 and started his second tenure back in March 2009.</p>
