      <h1>Nursery nurse Demi Harris has jail term cut for killing partner Christopher Pearson</h1>
      <h2>Judges said the sentence was too long</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:48:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author">Champion News Service</a></address>
      <p>A nursery nurse who killed her partner after a drunken row at a hot-tub party at her Nottinghamshire home had her jail term slashed by top judges.</p>
      <p>Demi Harris, 22, knifed Christopher Pearson, 39, to death in the bedroom at their home, in Hucknall, in February last year.</p>
      <p>Both were "quite drunk" and Harris was angry when her partner stripped to get into a hot-tub with other friends.</p>
      <p>She went to challenge him and was dragged fully-clothed into the water, sparking a row which led to her stabbing him twice with a knife.</p>
      <p>She claimed it was self-defence and was acquitted of murder, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/nursery-nurse-demi-harris-jailed-2297781">but convicted of manslaughter at Nottingham City Crown court last October.</a></p>
      <p>Harris, of Strathmore Close, was jailed for eight years.</p>
      <p>But after a challenge at the Court of Appeal in London, top judges have now slashed Harris' jail term to six years.</p>
      <p>"We have concluded that the judge imposed a sentence which was too long," said Mrs Justice Cockerill.</p>
      <p>Ruling, the judge said Harris and Mr Pearson had been together for three years in a "somewhat volatile" relationship.</p>

      <p>There was evidence before the jury at the trial that he was "on occasion aggressive and violent" towards his younger partner.</p>
      <p>On February 17, 2018, they went out drinking around Hucknall and ended up back at their house with friends.</p>
      <p>At 4.30am, Harris looked out of a window and saw Mr Pearson in his pants near their hot-tub.</p>
      <p>She shouted at him and he responded by dropping his boxer shorts to the floor.</p>
      <p>Harris went outside to confront him, but a male guest pulled her into the tub, fully-clothed.</p>
      <p>Angry, she got out and poured pool cleaner into the hot-tub before turning it off.</p>
      <p>She was followed inside by Mr Pearson, who she claimed then attacked her.</p>
      <p>She claimed that, in fear, she had taken hold of a knife, and he was stabbed twice.</p>
      <p>Later, she said she "wanted to poke him" to get him away.</p>
      <p>By its verdict, the jury accepted that she did not intend to cause him serious injury, but also rejected her self-defence claim.</p>

      <p>Appealing against her sentence, Harris claimed the trial judge had not fully taken into account her mitigation.</p>
      <p>And he had placed too much emphasis on her use of a knife, her lawyers claimed.</p>
      <p>Giving judgment, Mrs Justice Cockerill said Harris had been "remorseful" immediately after the incident and done what she could to help.</p>
      <p>The attack was not premeditated and she was still young, the judge added.</p>
      <p>It was "wrong in principle" to count the use of the knife as an aggravating feature, it having already been taken into account in the sentencing.</p>
      <p>"Accordingly, we quash the sentence imposed and substitute a sentence of six years' imprisonment," she concluded.</p>
