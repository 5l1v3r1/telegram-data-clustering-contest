      <h1>New System of Propelling Drones out of Cannons Is the Fastest, Safest, and Most Exciting Way</h1>
      <h2>JPL and Caltech designed the new launch system for their quadcopter.</h2>

      <p>Drones come in many shapes and sizes and can be used for a variety of purposes. Up in the air, they're incredibly useful, but getting them up there can be a bit tricky depending on the surrounding conditions.</p>
      <p>A team of researchers from <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/tasks/showTask.cfm?FuseAction=ShowTask&amp;TaskID=352&amp;tdaID=700144">Caltech University and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) have designed an elegant and eye-catching solution: launching a drone from a cannon. </p>
      <p>The new invention saves time and can work under a number of different scenarios, not to mention it's exciting.</p>

      <h3>JPL and Caltech's cannon drone</h3>
      <p>The engineers named their invention SQUID, and it stands for <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/tasks/showTask.cfm?FuseAction=ShowTask&amp;TaskID=352&amp;tdaID=700144">Streamlined Quick Unfolding Investigation Drone</a>. It resembles a squid, as well as one of those spinning <a href="https://nerf.hasbro.com/en-us/product/nerf-sports-vortex-aero-howler-blue:C79EB558-E6C3-4139-AB83-6946A9FEEF87">Nerf Vortex balls</a>.</p>

      <p>It measures <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975628/ballistic-drone-launch-caltech-nasa-jpl-squid-pneumatic"><b>27 centimeters</b></a> (<b>under a foot</b>), weighs <b>530 grams</b> (<b>18 ounces</b>), and has <b>four spring rotor arms</b> that fall into place in under <b>a tenth of a second</b> after the drone is launched. </p>
      <p>The way the SQUID drone becomes airborne is through a pneumatic baseball pitching machine, aka: the cannon. The cannon gives the SQUID a starting speed of around <b>56 km per hour</b> (<b>35 miles per hour)</b>.</p>
      <p>The four rotors start to move at <b>200 milliseconds</b> after the SQUID is launched, and the <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/video/heres-a-new-drone-to-help-you-in-any-part-of-your-life">drone</a> is hovering in under a second. </p>
      <p>All very impressive. </p>

      <p>By launching a drone <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/drones/caltech-and-jpl-firing-quadrotors-out-of-cannons">ballistically</a>, it starts operating much more quickly than if it were to launch from a standstill position. On top of this, the SQUID has more flexibility than standstill drones as it can be launched from moving objects. </p>
      <p>The team put the cannon and SQUID to the test as they drove at<b> 80 km per hour</b> (<b>50 miles an hour</b>) and launched the drone from the back of their moving pickup truck. </p>
      <p>This type of launch makes the drone useful for a number of operations. For instance, military units and emergency responders would be able to launch surveillance drones much more quickly.</p>

      <p>The researchers shared their research paper on <i><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05639.pdf">arXiv</a></i>, where they <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05639.pdf">explain that,</a> "A rotorcraft greatly expands the data collection range of a rover, and allows access to sites that a rover would find impassible."</p>
      <p>This isn't the first launchable drone to be built, however, it is the first of its kind to have multi-rotor designs — offering it more flexibility than previous fixed-wing ones. </p>
