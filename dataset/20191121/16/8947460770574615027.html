      <h1>2019 LA Auto Show: Porsche Taycan — A Living Legend in the Flesh</h1>
      <h2>It seems like all cars in this uber-high-performance luxury car segment are just becoming gigantic, squishy, straight-line bullet trains. They’re all astonishingly quick but lack …</h2>

      <p>Arguably the most important car to debut at the 2019 <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/21/2019-la-auto-show-ford-mustang-mach-e-an-electric-mustang-suv/">LA Auto Show</a> was the new Porsche <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/06/test-drive-porsche-taycan-turbo-s-a-brutally-fast-electric-sportscar/">Taycan </a>4S<a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/06/test-drive-porsche-taycan-turbo-s-a-brutally-fast-electric-sportscar/">.</a> We’ve all see the new Taycan Turbo and Turbo S models, with their blistering, mind-boggling performance. However, both of those cars wear supercar price tags. Which is what makes the Taycan 4S, with its more reasonable (relatively) price tag very interesting.</p>
      <p>The new Porsche Taycan 4S  might not be as exciting or as brutally fast as the Turbo or Turbo S models but it’s the more important car because it’s the one that’s priced similarly to the 911. So it has a real chance to cannibalize 911 sales, as traditional customers might want to get into something new and interesting.</p>

      <p>For $103,800 to start, the Porsche Taycan 4S uses two electric motors, one at each axle, to make a whopping 522 hp. While the Porsche 911 Carrera starts at $97,400 and it only has 379 hp. The 911 takes 4.0 seconds flat to reach 60 mph, while the Taycan 4S takes a scant 3.8 seconds. The electric Porsche also gets a nice back seat and more trunk space. So the Taycan actually looks like the better deal than the famed 911.</p>
      <p>In person, the Porsche Taycan is a good looking car. It’s not gorgeous and it’s not going to make your jaw drop. However, it does look cool and it’s undoubtedly a Porsche. It also sports a nice cabin, featuring rich materials and great technology. Even the back seat is nice.</p>

      <p>While the Mustang Mach-E is considered by many to be the most important car in LA, as it’s an actual affordable EV with good performance and a healthy range. However, the Porsche Taycan is going to challenge what people think of a proper sports car. Personally, I’ve always wanted to buy a new 911, it’s always been a dream of mine. But if I had the money, I think I’d actually go with the Taycan.</p>
