      <p>The Ludhiana Police Thursday lodged an FIR against Punjabi singer Elly Mangat for allegedly firing celebratory bullets in the air at an event in Dharaur village.</p>
      <p>The incident took place at a birthday party of one Bhupinder Singh on the night of November 19, where Mangat opened fire in the air twice, using a 12 bore licensed rifle of Gurbant Singh, father of Bhupinder Singh, said the police. The police claimed that Bhupinder, who arranged the party, made an attempt to destroy the rifle but failed to do so.</p>

      <p>In a seven-second video posted on social media platform Instagram, shared by another guest at the party, Mangat is seen firing twice with a weapon and again with a rifle. The video was captioned, ”Happy bday Bhinder bro.. Karta start km singer sabb ne’ (Happy birthday Bhinder brother. Singer has started celebrations in his way).</p>
      <p>Inspector Inderjit Singh Boparai, SHO, Sahnewal police station said Gurbant Singh has been arrested and a rifle along with nine live cartridges was recovered from him, adding that the owner of the other weapon is being verified.</p>
      <p>As during the first few seconds of the video, it is unclear if Mangat is holding a pistol or any other weapon, the SHO said, “The video also shows Mangat firing with another weapon, most probably a pistol. We are yet to verify from where this weapon came from or maybe it is an edited graphic.” He added that Mangat and Bhupinder are absconding.</p>
      <p>The FIR, against Mangat, Bhupinder and his father, has been registered at the Sahnewal police station under the sections 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 109 (Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 34 (act done with common intention) of IPC and sections 25, 27, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act.</p>
      <p>In <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/singer-elly-mangat-gets-bail-6009956/">another incident</a></b>, two months ago, Mangat was arrested on September 11 after he reached Mohali to settle scores with another Punjabi singer, Rammi Randhawa. Both the singers had indulged in a spat on social media and had put up inflammatory posts. Elly Mangat accused Randhawa of maligning his image, while Randhawa alleged that Elly was threatening him. Both the singers decided to meet on September 11 at Randhawa’s flat in Sector 88 to settle scores. He was held on charges of hurting religious sentiments and posting inflammatory posts on social media. Later, he received bail.</p>
