      <p><b>Zendaya</b> isn’t holding a grudge against E! News and <b>Giuliana Rancic</b> after the former <i>Fashion Police</i> host made fun of her hair in 2015, despite a false tabloid report. <b>Gossip Cop</b> looked into the story. It’s totally untrue.</p>
      <p><i><b>In Touch</b></i> alleges the <i>Euphoria</i> star has held a four-year grudge against Rancic ever since she took a jab at the actress’s dreadlocks in 2015. At the time, Rancic said on an episode of <i>Fashion Police</i> that Zendaya looked like “she smells like patchouli oil or weed.” As evidence of the supposedly ongoing feud, the tabloid points to the fact that Zendaya walked past Rancic on the red carpet at the People’s Choice Awards earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“Zendaya may forgive, but she doesn’t forget,” an anonymous tipster tells the magazine. “She’s refused to work with E! ever since Giuliana made that comment.” According to this dubious insider, Rancic expected the actress to “get over it with time,” but she’s since been stonewalled by the actress. “She doesn’t talk to Giuliana,” the source concludes, “and she doesn’t think about it — that’s it.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the actress is denying the story entirely. The actress’s spokesperson, who’s qualified to speak on her behalf, points out that Zendaya didn’t stop for any red carpet interviews at the People’s Choice Awards. She didn’t avoid Rancic specifically. <b>Gossip Cop</b> would also like to point out that the People’s Choice Awards are officially known as the E! People’s Choice Awards. Why would she show up to an event run by a network that she refuses to work with?</p>
      <p>It’s also worth noting that <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1070795/zendaya-dishes-on-sweet-greece-vacation-with-family-and-jacob-elordi">Zendaya gave an interview to E! News in September</a>, where she discussed her recent family vacation and her career. There’s obviously no real bad blood between<i> </i>the actress and the network in any capacity. Additionally, the tabloid is totally misconstruing the original events that inspired this so-called “feud.”</p>
      <p>Shortly after the incident, <a href="https://twitter.com/Zendaya/status/570075725765541888">Zendaya made a social media post about the situation</a> and called attention to the issues raised by the implications of the E! host’s comments. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS7U4Dz58O4">Rancic issued an on-air apology</a> the next day. “I want to say to Zendaya, and anyone else out there that I have hurt, that I am so, so sincerely sorry,” the TV personality said. “This really has been a learning experience for me. I’ve learned a lot today, and this incident has taught me to be a lot more aware of cliches and stereotypes, how much damage they can do and that I am responsible, as we all are, to not perpetuate them further.”</p>
      <p>Zendaya responded positively to the apology and posted <a href="https://twitter.com/Zendaya/status/570665155165421568">another note on social media explaining her feelings</a>. “Giuliana, I appreciate your apology and I’m glad it was a learning experience for you and for the network,” she wrote. “I hope that others negatively affected by her words can also find it in their hearts to accept her apology as well.”</p>
      <p><i>In Touch</i> has tried to push other made-up feuds between celebrities before. In August, the outlet incorrectly reported that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/madonna-alicia-vikander-harpers-bazaar-cover-replaced/"><i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> was replacing Madonna on their cover</a> after she fought with the publication. Additionally, a little over a week ago, the tabloid baselessly claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/kristen-stewart-miley-cyrus-hate/">Kristen Stewart hated Miley Cyrus</a>. Neither of those stories were even close to true, and this latest one is just as fake.</p>
