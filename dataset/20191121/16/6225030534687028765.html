Making his third career start, the Todd Pletcher-trained son of Tapit overcame a stumbling start to take the lead on the backstretch and continue on to register a dominating 5 ½-length victory in a mile maiden special weight race.</p>
      <p>Pletcher has since confirmed with the Daily Racing Form that he's pointing Fort McHenry to the Smooth Air.</p>
