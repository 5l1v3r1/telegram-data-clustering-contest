      <p>ST. JOHN'S, N.L. — The president of a Quebec airline being sued by the family of a crash victim says such claims come with the business of running an airline.</p>
      <p>Jean Tremblay, president of Air Saguenay, says he anticipated damage claims would be filed from families of the seven men who perished when one of his company's float planes crashed into a Labrador lake last July.</p>
      <p>The wreckage was never recovered from Mistastin Lake, and a Transportation Safety Board of Canada investigation never determined the cause of the crash.</p>
      <p>A statement of claim filed last week in Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court by the family of one man alleges negligence and breach of contractual duties to the victim, who had been working as a fishing guide on the trip to Mistastin Lake.</p>
      <p>Tremblay says he was a little surprised by the negligence allegations, which have not been tested in court, saying his airline followed regulations with an experienced pilot and a recently inspected aircraft.</p>
      <p>He says he sees the process as an insurance negotiation rather than a legal battle and expressed hope that the claim can be resolved in the best possible way given the tragic circumstances.</p>
