      <p>Alicia Agneson is returning to Vikings despite her character Freydis being killed off at the end of season five.</p>
      <p>And she’s just gone and teased her comeback to the History Channel hit on Instagram, with a video of her transformation.</p>
      <p>Leading up to her death scene, where she was brutally murdered by Ivar The Boneless, the goddess-like Nordic sported long blonde hair that was usually braided in some incredibly intricate design.</p>
      <p>However, in recent trailers, Freydis has been spotted alive and kicking, but this time around she’s a Russian brunette.</p>

      <p>Now, we’re pretty sure there was no such thing as hair dye back in 800AD, so we can’t help but wonder how director Michael Hirst has managed to bring the star back.</p>

      <p>But she is returning, alright, and Alicia couldn’t help but hint at her ‘new’ role just weeks before season 6 is set to kick off.</p>
      <p>‘HONESTLY GUYS I can’t contain my excitement for the 4th of December when Season 6 of @historyvikings airs,’ she wrote to her 142,000 followers.</p>
      <p>‘Here’s a little sneak for you of me, @mucy_lartin , @zuelikadelaney &amp; @aideenjo . This is how we roll at 5am in the morning.’</p>
      <p>In the short clip, the 23-year-old can be seen in hair and makeup singing along to Lynn Anderson’s song, Rose Garden.</p>

      <p>And as she pans the camera around, she shoots to newcomer Lucy Martin who will be playing Ingrid in the next installment of the historical saga.</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to comment and couldn’t contain their excitement over the impending episodes.</p>
      <p>‘Beauties. I am ridiculously excited to see Freydis again and her look a like. Oh And obviously Ingrid,’ one wrote while another said: ‘OMG!!!! this season it’s gonna be AMAZING! can’t wait to see.’</p>
      <p>Someone else questioned the look, adding: ‘It’s fake blonde hair?’</p>

      <p>Alicia is yet to confirm how she managed to make a comeback and whether or not she will be playing Freydis or will return to a new role.</p>
