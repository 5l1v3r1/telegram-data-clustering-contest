      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:29:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Kali Lindsay, Emma Munbodh</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of careers could be missing on benefits worth a total of £1.5billion, a charity has warned.</p>
      <p>Carer’s Allowance - which is paid to those who care full time for someone with a disability - is worth up to £3,440.00 a year alone, Turn2Us said.</p>
      <p>And worryingly, as many as 440,000 could be missing out on it - equating to £1.5billion of unclaimed allowance annually, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/carers-missing-out-15billion-worth-20928371">Mirror reports</a> .</p>
      <p>"Caring for someone is a huge responsibility and research shows that carers are disproportionately socially and economically vulnerable," Sara Willcocks, at Turn2us said.</p>
      <p>"Most carers give up their working and personal lives to care for family or friends.</p>
      <p>"Carer’s Allowance is there to be claimed but so many are missing out. We implore anyone who cares for someone for more than 35 hours a week to do a benefit check and see what their entitlements are."</p>
      <p>Carer's Allowance is an additional income for people who spend at least 35 hours a week supporting someone who has a disability.</p>
      <p>The person you care for must be getting a relevant benefit because of their condition, which in some cases has to be paid at a certain rate.</p>
      <p>You don’t have to be related to, or live with, the person you care for to get the benefit, and it applies whether you are in or out of work, providing you're not earning more than £123 a week.</p>
      <p>The benefit is not means-tested - it is not based on your personal income or savings - but earnings may affect your entitlement. Typically, the average recipient will get £66.15 a week.</p>
      <p>If you don't qualify for it, you may be entitled to Carers' Credit instead.</p>
      <p>This applies if you are under the state pension age and are caring for someone for at least 20 hours a week.</p>
      <p>Universal Credit is also available if you are out of work or on a low income.</p>
      <p>People who spend more than 35 hours a week caring for someone who is getting a benefit because of their disability can get extra money included in the six-in-one benefit.</p>
      <p>Pension Credit is paid in cases where one partner is under pension age and the other is over it.</p>
      <p>Turn2Us recommends that carers who are worried about financial support use its <a href="http://icm-tracking.meltwater.com/link.php?DynEngagement=true&amp;H=btYXC68syxmDVppbhVzFoYHdeMNV9070xvOlf%2FNdDQ0wXj6aidRhm4sv6IdHPQRNGKwJ6XiRFjlNn26T5s6ShOuFZSqGL4HeG3VY%2BOiSCnCmW2xXKYfKPs5WSGv8XX7ebatPHNShLCQ%3D&amp;G=0&amp;R=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.turn2us.org.uk&amp;I=20191120111224.0000094f1274%40mail6-114-ussnn1&amp;X=MHwxMDQ2NzU4OjVkZDUxZjkzZmI1YzBkODI5ZGE0NWMzYTs%3D&amp;S=p9bM2tW8OvSES8tTEJrZE82B_hJbcAVnm5gHpXeNfdI">online calculator</a>  to check what benefits or charitable grants they may be eligible for.</p>
