      <h3>I appreciated Rob Vanstone’s article, “<a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-show-that-nice-guys-can-finish-first/wcm/74c4076f-21b4-40dd-9a74-c8e1930f1f80">Roughriders able to show that nice guys can finish first</a>” (SP, Nov. 6). I liked it as a longtime Roughrider fan but more importantly because it illustrates how we are all stronger when we have a common goal and work together.</h3>
      <p>I hold this example up as a strong contrast to what is happening to us as a Canadian society. I am deeply troubled that there are some among us who appear to be willing to “cut off their noses to spite their faces.” The “Wexit movement” seems to be willing to suffer irreparable losses in a foolhardy attempt to bring suffering to fellow Canadians because they feel left out or unappreciated.</p>
      <p>This whole situation is far too complex for me to try and support my position with a rudimentary analysis by an 82-year-old citizen. Instead, just think about what would happen if members of the Roughriders were arguing among themselves about why someone gets more money than they do. Or why some get more publicity? If one or more players decided they wouldn’t give their best effort unless and until they got more money, better bonuses or whatever.</p>
      <p>Our situation is serious, the problems are real and complex and rooted in a historical context. Nevertheless, we are stronger together. Just ask the Riders.</p>
