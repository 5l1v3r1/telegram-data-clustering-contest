      <p>Fans were worried about the fate of the beloved soap opera <a href="https://www.globaltv.com/shows/days-of-our-lives/">“Days Of Our Lives” after </a>a report from <a href="https://tvline.com/2019/11/12/days-of-our-lives-cancelled-cast-fired-season-56/"><i>TV Line suggested</i></a> producers of the long-running series had released the entire cast from their contracts.</p>

      <p>Yet no worries were needed as <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/days-of-our-lives-renewed-season-56-nbc-1202792383/"><i>Deadline</i> </a>confirmed that NBC has renewed the series for its 56th season.</p>
      <p>The cost-cutting move by releasing the cast from their contracts came as NBC and “Days” distributor Sony Pictures TV were in negotiations to renew the show which typically happens at the start of the year. However, with the backlash on Twitter, negotiations were likely sped up.</p>
