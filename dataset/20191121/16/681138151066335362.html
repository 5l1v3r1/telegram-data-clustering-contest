        <b>With Christmas rapidly approaching, a call has gone out for shoppers to support independent traders in Suffolk.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ever-increasing popularity of online shopping and the bombardment of Black Friday deals means it can be hard for independent businesses to get a look in.</p>
      <p>But not-so hidden in plain sight is a plethora of independent shops in towns across the county, from Ipswich to Aldeburgh.</p>
      <p>It is estimated that for every £10 spent in an independent shop, an additional £50 goes back into the local economy - creating a cycle of local business owners spending their money on local services, and in local pubs and restaurants.</p>
      <p>In Sudbury, the chamber of commerce has joined forces with local secondary schools to promote shopping locally in a bid to make the town more prosperous.</p>
      <p>The scheme, called Celebrate Sudbury, has adopted the slogan "use it or lose it" in the hope residents realise the wealth of opportunity on their doorstep.</p>
      <p>A leaflet for the scheme says people should shop locally more because:</p>
      <p>1. There is a diverse range of shops</p>
      <p>2. You can check the quality of goods before you buy</p>
      <p>3. Faulty goods can be easily returned or exchanged</p>
      <p>4. You can shop in a safe and relaxed town centre</p>
      <p>5. There is a quality cafe culture for socialising</p>
      <p>6. You are supporting your local town</p>
      <p>Michael Heyland, director of Sudbury and District Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the county is lucky to have so many independent businesses.</p>
      <p>Mr Heyland added: "While a buyer can see and feel the quality of a local purchase, he or she is also supporting the town where they live."</p>
      <p>Lawra Stubbs, owner of Ipswich independent shop Miss Quirky Kicks in Orwell Place, said: "It is really important to shop independent - not just to help the dying high street but also to keep people's dreams alive, as without our loyal customers we wouldn't be able to continue doing what we love."</p>
      <p>Miss Stubbs set up the shop - which specialises in crystals, salt lamps, clothing and American treats - after running a successful market stall, built on the foundations of shopping locally.</p>
