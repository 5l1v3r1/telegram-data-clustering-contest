      <p>A West Mercia Police spokeswoman said: "At around 2.20pm we were called to reports of a domestic incident in Coton Hill in Shrewsbury."</p>
      <p>The road closure meant that traffic in the Castle Foregate/Smithfield Road and Coton Hill/Berwick Road area was disrupted and parents were concerned they would not make pick-up time for their children at Greenfields School.</p>
      <p>Police said the operation was concluded by around 4.30pm, and confirmed a 23-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of assault and criminal damage.</p>
      <p>They confirmed no one had been injured in the incident.</p>
