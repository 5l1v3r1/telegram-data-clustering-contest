      <p>Two Chinese nationals – Liang Hin and Wei Junzhi, both 32 – were charged in the Siem Reap Provincial Court on Thursday accused of stealing a motorbike.</p>
      <p>Siem Reap provincial court spokesman Yin Srang said on Thursday that the two were charged with theft with aggravating circumstances per Article 357 of the Criminal Code.</p>
      <p>If proven guilty, the suspects could face imprisonment of three to 10 years.</p>
      <p>Deputy provincial police chief Pheung Chandareth said on Sunday that two Thai nationals rented a motorbike for three days. But the next day, they reported the motorbike missing.</p>
      <p>Upon checking the bike’s GPS tracker, it was discovered that the vehicle was on its way to Phnom Penh.</p>
      <p>Siem Reap police then contacted Kandal provincial police and intercepted the suspects in Muk Kampul district, Kandal province.</p>
      <p>“Because the stolen motorbike was equipped with a GPS, it was easy for us to find it,” Chandareth said.</p>
      <p>Upon inspection, police also found tools which were used to break the motorbike’s lock along with 12 Chinese identification cards.</p>
      <p>Kheng Meng Chheang, minor crimes bureau chief of the National Police’s criminal department, said the accused were reportedly involved in some other crimes such as car theft and burglary.</p>
