      </p>
      <p>The Senate Thursday passed the Finance Bill 2019, which increased the rate of Value Added Tax from five per cent to 7.5 per cent and equally streamlined the nation’s tax regime.</p>
      <p>The passage of the Bill followed the presentation and consideration of the report of the Senator Solomon Adeola-led Senate Committee on Finance on the Finance Bill 2019.</p>
      <p>In his comment after the passage of the Bill, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the amendment is meant to generate revenue to fund the 2020 Budget.</p>
      <p>Lawan said: “We amended seven Acts largely to ensure that we streamline the tax system in Nigeria and ensure that we get revenues for government to provide services and infrastructure to the citizens of this country.</p>
      <p>“What we have done is very significant because this is to ensure that we not only have sources of funding but credible and reliable sources of funding for the 2020 Appropriation but also for subsequent activities of government.</p>
      <p>“The revenue generating agencies will have to sit up. The National Assembly, particularly the Senate, will be mounting a lot of oversight. If they have targets, we must ensure they meet the targets.</p>
      <p>“I believe what we have done is not to put taxes or burden on the ordinary people. What we have done is to create more revenue.”</p>
      <p>The seven Bills that were amended included: Petroleum Profit Tax Act (PPT), Customs and Excise Tax Act, Company Income Tax Act (CITA), Personal Income Tax Act, Value Added Tax Act, Stamp Duties Tax Act, and the Capital Gains Act.</p>
      <p>Senate President Ahmad Lawan urged revenue generating agencies to sit up, and ensure they do their work with patriotism.</p>
      <p>The Finance Bill was presented alongside the 2020 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 8, 2019.</p>
      <p>Chairman Senator Adeola said following the presentations at the Public Hearing and submissions made by the relevant stakeholders, the Committee observed that:</p>
      <p>“The Bill sought to amend the provision of the companies income Tax Act by curbing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) as proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and broaden the triggers for domestic taxation of income earned by non-resident companies in Nigeria through dependent agents and via online market platforms.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The Bill also seek to address the taxation of industries, such as insurance, start-ups and the capital markets, deemed by the Federal Government of Nigeria as critical to the growth and development of the Nigerian economy.</p>
      <p>“The Bill proposes to improve the efficiency of the Nigerian VAT system taking into consideration recommendations from various stakeholder groups. Attached herewith is a list of selected countries with their respective VAT rates.</p>
      <p>“The Bill also seeks to expand VAT coverage by addressing some critical issues such as taxation of digital economy, VAT registration thresholds and intangibles.</p>
      <p>“The Bill wishes to subject certain imported goods to excise duties in similar manner as their local manufactured counterparts.</p>
      <p>“The Bill also seeks to provide clarity and efficiency in the administration of individual income taxes in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“The Bill also covers the taxation of business combination and seeks to prevent abuse of provisions of the Act on group restructuring.</p>
      <p>“The Bill also seeks to increase revenue generation from duties on Electronic Stamps Duties.</p>
      <p>“The Bill seeks to improve revenue by removing the tax exemption granted for dividends or incomes received from companies charged under Petroleum Profits Tax Act.</p>
      <p>“The Bill was a welcome development and the consensus view was that its proposals and principles should be sustained, subject to the specific recommendations of the Committee.”</p>
      <p>Adeola said that after considering the specific issues raised by the various Stakeholders on the relevant sections of the Bill, the Committee noted that: “The initiative of the Executive in the Finance Bill, alongside the Executive Budget proposals and the Appropriation Bill was welcomed and long overdue.”</p>
      <p>He added that “going forward, the Executive should be encouraged to propose to the National Assembly, Finance Bills to support the fiscal policies of the annual Budget and should also sustain the initiative as an annual tradition.”</p>
      <p>The Committee also recommended that the proposed amendments to the Finance Bill be approved by the Senate.</p>
      <p>While responding to questions from reporters, Adeola denied that there is any disagreement between the Senate and the House of Representatives on the Finance Bill.</p>
      <p>“There is no issue between the Senate and the House Committee on Finance. Because of the independence of each chamber, they decided to hold their public hearing on Tuesday,” he<br/>said.</p>
      <p>Adeola said that a provision to exempt companies with less than N25million turnover from the payment of VAT.</p>
      <p>He said: Also included in this Finance Bill, we now have reliefs for some small companies that if your revenue as a company is less than N25million, you are exempted from payment of VAT and also tax.</p>
      <p>“We also went a step further that if you are a company which we have tagged to be a medium company whose revenue is less than N100 million, your company income tax has been reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent.</p>
      <p>“Long before now, activities in the Capital Market have been at the lowest ebb but with this singular action of passing this bill, we have activated the Capital Market.</p>
      <p>“What do I mean by that. In the past, I have shares I cannot use to do any transaction but by the passage of this Bill, you can now use your shares to borrow money where the dividend paid on those shares can be used as an interest on the money borrowed.”</p>
      <p>Adeola said: “Long before now, billions of dollars of transaction happen on the internet through companies not physically domiciled in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“People buy some things on Amazon, Google, YouTube at zero cost. For us as a nation, no revenue is derived. By the passage of this Bill, we have succeeded in putting in place a mechanism where all those e-commerce transaction, Nigeria can start gaining something from it. This is in accordance with global best practices.</p>
      <p>“We have put a proviso there that it will be the duty of the Minister to determine the substantial economic importance of this particular transaction in this country.</p>
      <p>On distribution of revenue accruable from the VAT, Adeola said that 85 per cent on what is collected goes the states and local governments.</p>
      <p>“Only a paltry sum of 15 per cent stay with the Federal Government,” he said.</p>
      <p>On why make law to increase stamp duty when no agency of government is forthcoming on the amounts collected so far, Adeola said: “We know where the Stamp Duty money is. I know there is litigation as to who is supposed to collect the money. But the money is being warehoused by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).”</p>
      <p>Spokesman of the Senate, Senator Godiya Akwashiki, when asked by reporters what the Senate will do to ensure necessary palliatives for Nigerians in view of the expected increase in the price of basic necessities in the country, said: “We have just passed the Bill and I want to assure you that by the time they start the implementation of the Bill, Nigerians will start enjoying it.”</p>
