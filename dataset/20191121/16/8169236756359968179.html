        <b>Tottenham are now the favourites ahead of Manchester United to clinch the transfer of Gareth Bale from Real Madrid.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Wales international is now just 11/4 with Ladbrokes to return to Spurs after a difficult time at Real Madrid of late.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/20/jose-mourinho-tottenham-doomed-to-fail/">Jose Mourinho’s appointment at Tottenham</a> is bound to affect things, with the Portuguese tactician known to have tried to sign Bale during his time as Man Utd manager.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have continued to be linked with the 30-year-old, but it <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/football/football-specials/gareth-bale/club-after-summer-transfer-window">increasingly seems the bookies</a> are all putting Tottenham at the front of the queue.</p>

      <p>Bale seems likely to be one of this January’s movers after coming so close to leaving Real in the summer, so it’s surely worth a punt on him returning to Spurs or indeed moving to another top Premier League club.</p>
      <p>United would surely take him as an upgrade on the inconsistent Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, while Chelsea could still do with a replacement for Eden Hazard, though that will depend on their <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/11865941/chelsea-set-for-verdict-on-transfer-ban-appeal-in-december">transfer ban being lifted</a>.</p>
