      <p>The owner and driver of a lorry seized by police after 16 people were found in a sealed trailer on board a ferry are Irish, officers confirmed.</p>
      <p>The Stena Line freight and passenger service arrived in Rosslare in Co Wexford on Thursday afternoon from Cherbourg in France.</p>
      <p>The men were Middle Eastern, mainly aged between 20 and 35, and police are investigating possible immigration offences.</p>
      <p>Senior officers said the men were all in good health when they were found and it was fortunate they were not dealing with a tragedy.</p>
      <p>Garda Superintendent Jim Doyle said: “This has been a traumatic time for them and they are being treated with compassion.”</p>

      <p>The group, one of whom may be a juvenile, was found by a ferry company employee conducting a routine patrol who heard noise coming from the trailer.</p>
      <p>Two ambulances, doctors and police cars drove onto the ship’s vehicle deck shortly after it docked in south-east Ireland.</p>
      <p>The articulated lorry was photographed and examined on the ferry and has now been removed to a secure location for further technical examination, police said.</p>
      <p>It is owned by a local Irish-based company and the owners are “co-operating fully” with the ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>Gardai said the driver is a man aged in his 50s, resident of Ireland for over 25 years, and he is also co-operating fully with the ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>A large police and Immigration Bureau presence was visible around the port.</p>
      <p>Supt Doyle said: “It is very fortunate that they were found and they were found alive and in good spirits.”</p>
      <p>The men are all being processed under immigration law and will be taken to a centre in Dublin, the officer said.</p>

      <p>The force said all the individuals received medical assessments after arrival at Rosslare, one of Ireland’s main sea ports for passengers and freight.</p>
      <p>It added: “Garda Immigration Officers attached to Wexford Garda Station, supported by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) will carry out an assessment on the immigration status of all the persons.”</p>
      <p>Ian Hampton, Stena Line’s chief people and communications officer, confirmed an employee discovered the people during a routine inspection shortly before 10am on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The incident comes just days after a group of 25 people were found inside a refrigerated container on board a UK-bound ship just off the coast of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Last month, 39 people were found dead inside a container in Essex which had arrived in the UK via a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
      <p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told broadcaster RTE: “Of course our initial response will be a humanitarian one, to make sure those people are well and that their health is good.</p>
      <p>“After that of course there will need to be a response that involves the gardai, because as you know human trafficking is illegal, and we’ll need to see what happens with the people who come ashore.”</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said those found in the lorry container were being cared for by state services.</p>
