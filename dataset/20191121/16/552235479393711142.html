      <h1>Mikael Lustig pinpoints the Virgil van Dijk 'aura' that convinced Celtic team-mates he'd be a star</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool centre-back is only the second best player he's played with though.</h2>

      <p>Former Celtic defender <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mikael-lustig">Mikael Lustig</a> says he knew right away that Virgil van Dijk would be a star, naming the Liverpool man as the second best player he's ever played with.</p>
      <p>The Swedish right-back left <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-park">Celtic Park</a> in the summer after winning eight league titles, as well as four Scottish Cups and four League Cups.</p>
      <p>During his time in Glasgow he played alongside the world's most expensive defender, and while Lustig named a former international team-mate as the best he's played with, he was never in any doubt <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/virgil-van-dijk">Van Dijk</a> would be a star.</p>
      <p>He told Het Laatste Nieuws: "The best I've ever played with was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/zlatan-ibrahimovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> .</p>

      <p>"He's so big and strong, but he's also got that agility that means he can still do things that usually only smaller players can do.</p>
      <p>"But Virgil van Dijk is right behind him. He has everything a defender needs: he's big, strong in the air and also very quick.</p>
      <p>"He gives off this aura of: 'no striker is going to get past me'.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"And in the last year at Liverpool no-one managed to.</p>
      <p>"But you know, I also enjoyed playing with Dedryck Boyata. You always knew what you got from him and I felt very comfortable beside him."</p>
