      <p>Audiobooks are a great way to consume written media when you don’t necessarily have the time to sit down and read for hours on end.</p>
      <p>Audible is the perfect platform to consume audiobooks, and now you can pick up a four-month membership for less than £4 per month in the Black Friday sale. This includes a free audiobook every month, and unlimited access to Audible Original Podcasts.</p>
      <p>Considering Audible is normally £7.99 per month, this is definitely one of the best Black Friday deals you can find at the moment. Audible allows you to build up an audiobook library, and even when you cancel the service, you’ll retain all the audiobooks you’ve downloaded.</p>
