      <h1>Beyonce, Ed Sheeran, Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift And Ariana Grande Are Up For Best Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:46:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>The 62nd Grammy nominations were announced and there’s some serious competition for Best Pop Vocal Album. To qualify for a vocal album at least 51 percent of the album must be comprised of original vocals. The category was once known as Best Contemporary Album then it was simply Best Pop Album. The 51 percent of vocal tracks ensure that the nominees are separate from instrumental type albums and ones that consist primarily of music in various formats.</p>
      <p>This is relatively a new category and only two artists have won two Grammys in it. They are Adele and Kelly Clarkson.</p>
      <p>The nominees for <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/beyonce-billie-eilish-ariana-grande-lizzo-and-taylor-swift-battle-it-out-for-best-pop-solo-performance-grammy-award-342831/">Best Pop Solo Album</a> are all women. The Best Pop Vocal Album category were almost all female save for four-time Grammy winner Ed Sheeran who scored his 14th Grammy nomination with Best Pop Vocal Album.</p>
      <p>Here is the complete list of those nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>“The Lion King: The Gift” by Beyonce</li>
        <li>“When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go” by Billie Eilish</li>
        <li>“Thank U, Next” By Ariana Grande</li>
        <li>“Lover” by Taylor Swift</li>
        <li>“No. 6 Collaborations Project” by Ed Sheeran</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You may see a list of the Best Pop Vocal Album Nominees from the Recording Academy below.</p>

      <p>Beyonce has a total of 70 Grammy nominations and a whopping 23 wins. There’s no doubt that she is favored to win this category. She has been nominated for a total of four Grammy awards for 2020. In addition to Best Pop Vocal Album, Beyonce is nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance, Best Song Written for Visual Media, and Best Music Film for <i>Homecoming</i>.</p>
      <p>Billie Eilish has burst on to the 2020 Grammy scene with six nominations including Best Pop Vocal Album, Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Album of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance. It’s likely Billie is going to walk away with something at this year’s Grammys.</p>
      <p>It would seem Ariana Grande would have a home filled with Grammy awards by now, but the artist known as “Ari” and “Riri” has a total of 11 Grammy nominations and one win. Last year, Ariana Grande won this category for <i>Sweetener</i>. If she were to win for Thank U, Next, she would tie Kelly Clarkson and Adele for winning Best Pop Vocal Album twice.</p>
      <p>Ariana Grande has a total of five Grammy nominations for 2020. In addition to Best Pop Vocal Album, Ariana is also nominated for Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance, and <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-jonas-brothers-and-more-nominated-for-best-pop-duo-or-group-performance-grammy-award-342873/">Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.</a></p>
      <p>Taylor Swift has a total of 35 Grammy nominations and currently has 10 wins. For 2020, she has been nominated three times for her album <i>Lover.</i> In addition to Best Pop Vocal Album, Taylor has been nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Song.</p>
      <p>Ed Sheeran only has one Grammy nomination for 2020 and that is for Beset Pop Vocal Album.</p>
      <p>Who do you think is going to win the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album?</p>
