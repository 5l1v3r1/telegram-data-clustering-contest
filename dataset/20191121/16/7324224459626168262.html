      <h1>Constituency profile: Bedford</h1>
      <h2>The Tories have their eye on one of Labour’s most vulnerable seats.</h2>

      <p>The constituency of Bedford, which Boris Johnson visited today, is one of the Conservatives’ top targets.</p>
      <p>Labour would lose the seat on a swing of just 0.9%.</p>
      <p>It ranks as number 11 on a list of Labour constituencies most vulnerable to the Tories.</p>
      <p>Bedford is the sort of place the Conservatives will be hoping to win comfortably at this election.</p>
      <p>A big victory would suggest the party is doing well enough across the country to have a large majority in the next parliament.</p>
      <p>A narrow victory could mean the Tories will fall short of a majority – especially if they also lose seats elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Labour’s Mohammad Yasin is defending a majority in Bedford of only 789.</p>
      <p>He won 47% of the vote in 2017, just ahead of the Tories on 45%.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats finished a distant third on 6%.</p>
      <p>In this election Mr Yasin is up against candidates from the Conservatives, Lib Dems, Greens and the Brexit Party.</p>
      <p>The presence on the ballot paper of the Brexit Party might be crucial in determining Labour’s fate.</p>
      <p>Were they to pick up even a small chunk of former Labour voters, that could be enough to tip the seat in the Conservatives’ direction.</p>
      <p>Bedford was a Tory seat from 2010 to 2017, before which it had been held by Labour since 1997.</p>
      <p>At every general election since 1997 Bedford has been a marginal seat fiercely contested by both Labour and the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>2019 will be no exception.</p>
