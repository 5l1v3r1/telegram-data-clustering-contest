      <h1>Pornhub to sell $300 lifetime membership for Black Friday</h1>

      <p>Pornhub has just introduced the deal of a lifetime.</p>
      <p>The mega-popular adult video website announced Thursday a $299 lifetime membership to its Pornhub Premium subscription service, a deal it says will make the “long, hard journey” of life a little more bearable.</p>
      <p>The deal — which is called “LifePlan” and will only be available on Black Friday — comes just days after PayPal <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/paypal-turns-off-payments-to-pornhub-models/">turned off payments to Pornhub models</a>, accusing the site of making “certain business payments” without its permission. Pornhub said it was “devastated” by the decision, which will dry up payments for more than 100,000 adult workers.</p>
      <p>Pornhub introduced the deal with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh1hvoZdUgk&amp;feature=youtu.be">tongue-in-cheek YouTube video</a> showing clips of couples old and young spending time together, with a gravelly voiced narrator proclaiming that “choosing the right partner is essential, a partner you can always count on.”</p>
      <p>The lifetime membership will give subscribers access to 125,000 premium videos, as well as get rid of ads on the website and allow higher-resolution streaming. Pornhub Premium normally costs just under $100 per year.</p>
      <p>For $299, the X-rated site promises, “there will always be a familiar face to take care of you, so that you can take care of yourself.”</p>
