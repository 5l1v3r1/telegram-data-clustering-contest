      <p>Police have launched a murder investigation into the death of Alison McBlain, 36, who was struck by a vehicle in Blackburn, Lancashire, on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>It is thought a Fiat Punto Grande mounted the pavement in Whalley Banks at the junction with Pearson Street and then hit Ms McBlain and a 26-year-old man from Blackburn, reports <a href="https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire-news/woman-named-first-time-dies-17295594">LancsLive</a>, our sister title.</p>
      <p>The car, believed to be on a cloned registration plate, number EX07PYA, failed to stop at the scene of the incident just before 7.50pm.</p>
      <p>A similar vehicle was later found in Lower Hollin Bank Street with significant front-end damage and attempts had been made to set it on fire.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lancashire Police said Ms McBlain died in hospital on Thursday with her family, including 12-year-old son Reagan, by her bedside.</p>
      <p>A 25-year-old man from Blackburn was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Lee Wilson, said: "Alison sadly passed away from her injuries today and my thoughts remain with her and her loved ones, including her young son.</p>
      <p>"This is now a murder investigation and I have a team of detectives and staff continuing to work hard on this investigation and we continue to follow a number of different lines of inquiry.</p>
      <p>"The public's help is key to us in piecing together the events which led up to this collision and to finding those responsible and I am grateful to everyone who has assisted us so far.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"No matter how insignificant you may feel the information you have is I would urge you to come and speak to us."</p>
