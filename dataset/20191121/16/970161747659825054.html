      <p>A mother-of-three who died during a ‘Brazilian butt lift’ operation may not have been appropriately informed about the risks involved in the controversial procedure, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Leah Cambridge, 29, saved up thousands to have the surgery done in Turkey last August, after feeling ‘paranoid about her body’.</p>
      <p>But she died during the operation, which involves fat being removed from areas of the body such as the stomach and back, and transferred into the buttocks to achieve an hourglass figure.</p>
      <p>An inquest into her death at Wakefield Coroners’ Court heard the beautician, from Leeds, booked the procedure through Elite Aftercare, a company which links patients to surgeons in Turkey.</p>
      <p>Simon Withey, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital in London, told the court the procedure has been banned in the UK pending further information on its dangers.</p>

      <p>The temporary moratorium followed a report by a US taskforce which suggested it could be up to 10 times as dangerous as the next riskiest cosmetic surgery.</p>

      <p>Discussing the dangers, Mr Withey said that it is still ‘not entirely clear’ why ‘surgeons who know what they are doing and are doing things very safely will still have deaths’.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the inquest Ms Cambridge’s mother, Theresa Hall, said they arrived in Turkey together late on August 26 and were taken straight to the Izmir Private Can Hospital where various forms were thrust in front of her.</p>
      <p>She described how it ‘all felt like such a rush’ and said she believed her daughter was pressured into reading and signing the papers, outlining some of the safety risks, as quickly as possible so the surgery could start.</p>
      <p>Although Mr Withey was not directly involved in Ms Cambridge’s case, he told the inquest she may not have been fully aware of how dangerous the butt lift is.</p>
      <p>‘She was a willing participant, but as to whether she was informed appropriately, I have my doubts that she was,’ he said.</p>
      <p>The inquest continues.</p>
