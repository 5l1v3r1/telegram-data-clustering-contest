      <h1>Six ways smart technology may transform the future of driving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:17:19+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/author/stephhazlegreaves/" target="_blank">Steph Hazlegreaves</a></address>
      <h3>Here, <a href="https://vindisgroup.com/audi">Vindis</a> offer their insight into how smart technology, such as AR dashboards, has the potential to alter the future of driving</h3>
      <p>Over recent years, technology has really shaped our day-to-day lives. Its fair to say that our routines haven’t changed all that much — we still chat to family and friends, shop for the things we enjoy, and travel to the places that we want to go. But the way we conduct these tasks has seen a complete transformation. From smartphones to smart metres, we love introducing new, innovative, technology into our lives. This tech makes everything a little easier and a lot more exciting!</p>
      <p>Indeed, the automotive industry is no stranger to these new technological trends either. Car manufacturers are constantly trying to stay up to date with new innovations. At the rate that smart technology is advancing, companies have to work hard to avoid being left behind. We’ve already seen huge advancements such as in-car Bluetooth systems, dash-cams, and key finders.</p>
      <p>But what’s next for the world of automotive tech? The smart technology predictions over the next few years are set to totally revolutionise the way people drive. These new ideas will focus on safer driving, easier driving, and adding more fun enhancements to your driving experience.</p>
      <h4>1. AR dashboard displays</h4>
      <p>Augmented reality dashboards will soon provide all the information you could possibly need to enhance your driving experience. Giving your dashboard a video-game aesthetic, AR displays will show any information you need to know about the car itself. They will also give you other vital information about the road, such as how quickly you’re approaching another car, and how best to avoid collisions.</p>
      <h4>2. 3D gesture technology</h4>
      <p>Imagine changing gears or winding down your car windows with a simple wave of your hand. Like magic, you will soon be able to control many elements of your vehicle with mere gestures. As well as being futuristic and fun, this tech is set to make driving easier and safer. Instead of jabbing at buttons on the radio, or being tempted to reach out for your phone, you will soon be able to point at the screen of your infotainment system to accept an incoming call — a simple solution that means you’ll never have to take your eyes off the road.</p>
      <h4>3. Inter-car communication</h4>
      <p>Cars that are hooked up to the internet are now fairly standard in the automotive world. Soon however, these internet-enabled cars will have the ability to communicate with one another, transforming our driving experience. Communication between cars will help prevent collisions, with precision that human error has never before allowed us to achieve. Before a collision can occur, the car-to-car communication system will foresee the accident and alert the driver to the potential consequences. They will then be able to react quickly and avoid catastrophe.</p>
      <p>The world’s leading car manufacturers are currently using this technology to develop fully autonomous models. Which leads us on to our next smart technology…</p>
      <h4>4. Self-driving cars</h4>
      <p>For a long time, we’ve been envisioning a world in which <a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/advanced-trials-self-driving-vehicles/58422/">cars will be able to drive around by themselves</a>. This idea once seemed futuristic and farfetched, but the tech is now being developed and tested by leading automotive companies such as Audi. Similar to the idea behind inter-car communication, self-driving cars are set to reduce the risk of human error on the road.</p>
      <p>The result? A safer and more reliable way to travel. The Google Self-Driving Car project was initiated in 2009 and has since been rebranded as <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>. After ordering a Waymo on an app, a self-driving car will pick you up and take you where you need to be — a journey which promises to be both extremely safe and very comfortable.</p>
      <p>The idea behind Waymo is that you can ‘ride with confidence’ and these vehicles have been branded as ‘the most experienced drivers’. Embracing self-driving cars feels like taking a leap of faith, but in the next few years, this tech is likely to feel much more commonplace. At this rate, we’ll have access to self-driving cars in our local Audi dealership sooner than we could have imagined.</p>
      <h4>5. Full integration with phones and smartwatches</h4>
      <p>We have already seen a huge integration between our cars and our smart gadgets, and this trend is set to continue. Recent innovations have seen car manufacturers such as Hyundai, pair up with the Android Wear app which allows users to complete a number of commands from your smartwatch. From your watch, you can start your engine remotely, lock your car’s doors, sound your horn, and turn the headlights on and off.</p>
      <p>What’s more, built-in integration with apps is set to become more commonplace with new car models. Many models now integrate popular apps into the infotainment system, making it look just like the usual screen on your phone.</p>
      <h4>6.  Automated parking systems</h4>
      <p>Finally, for those who are tired of searching for a parking space to riskily squeeze into, let us introduce automated parking systems. Parktronic systems that allow cars to find parking spaces and navigate to them already exist, but with new infrastructure around automated parking systems forecasted, the future looks bright for those who hate parking. This infrastructure will allow passengers to drop off the car at the entrance to a garage, allowing it to venture off and find its own <a href="https://www.parkingperx.com/">parking space</a>. And when you’re ready to be reunited with your wheels? A simple tap on an app will signal to your car that it’s time to journey back to the drop-off point.</p>
      <p>Some of these innovations may seem straight out of science fiction, but every day we are inching nearer to a world in which smart technology drives cars by itself. It may take some getting used to, but our future roads are set to be safer than ever!</p>
