      <h1>Workers ‘hot to trot’ on boosted super, industry chief tells politicians</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:08:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/samantha/" target="_blank">Samantha Maiden</a></address>
      <p>Workers are “hot to trot” over the need to increase the nation’s superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent and don’t want governments to tinker with the system.</p>
      <p>The head of the nation’s largest super fund, Australian Super chief Ian Silk, told the House economics committee on Thursday that Treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s warning about the <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/11/19/josh-frydenberg-wants-australians-to-work-for-longer/">economic “timebomb” of the nation’s ageing population</a> was another reason not to freeze compulsory super contributions.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have members turn up to … briefings and say, ‘we don’t want any more super’,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The reverse is the case. They are very hot to trot on the issue. They’re telling me in loud and clear terms they want 12 per cent.”</p>
      <p>Mr Silk was asked by Liberal MP Craig Kelly about the idea of allowing low-income-earners to take the super guarantee increase now to help with a house deposit,</p>
      <p>“I understand that, because who among us would confirm future consumption over current consumption?” he said. “Particularly if you’re a modest income-earner and wages growth is pretty modest.</p>
      <p>“But I would say this … that’s the sort of argument that was run in 1992, when the super guarantee was introduced, and the view taken then was it is important to take a long-term view.”</p>
      <p>Mr Silk said the two most commonly raised concerns among members were how much super to have and how to stop the government tinkering with it.</p>
