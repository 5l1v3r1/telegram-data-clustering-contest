      <h1>Injury Update For Patriots WR Phillip Dorsett</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:13:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The New England Patriots are preparing for a big showdown with the Dallas Cowboys this weekend. Unfortunately, it looks like there’s a chance they’ll be without one of their best receivers: WR Phillip Dorsett.</p>
      <p>According to Jeff Howe of The Athletic, Dorsett missed practice on Wednesday due to a concussion. Howe noted that despite missing practice there is still optimism that he will play on Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, Howe also noted that there is no “straight line to recovery.”</p>
      <p>Dorsett suffered the injury in New England’s win over the Philadelphia Eagles this past week. He had caught three passes for 33 yards and a touchdown prior to the injury.</p>

      <p>Dorsett has quietly been having one of his better seasons this year. His five touchdown catches are already a career-high, while his 332 receiving yards and the second-most of his career.</p>
      <p>He leads the Patriots in receiving touchdowns and is third on the team in receiving yards.</p>
      <p>Dorsett was a first round pick with the Indianapolis Colts in 2015. But his time with the Colts ended abruptly when he was traded to the Patriots in 2017 in exchange for quarterback Jacoby Brissett.</p>
      <p>Though he has yet to come close to being a consistent presence on the field, it’s clear that he’s finally found a niche in Bill Belichick’s squad.</p>
