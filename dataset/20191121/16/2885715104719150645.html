      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:47:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-web-desk/" target="_blank">Express Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>The External Affairs Ministry Thursday said that at least 23 per cent new petitions seeking H-1B visas for the US were denied in the 2019 fiscal year.</p>
      <p>The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa, which allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.</p>
      <p>Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, said that according to the data given out by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a total of 1,16,031 new petitions were processed and completed in 2019, out of which 27,707 petitions — accounting nearly 23.9 per cent — were denied.</p>
      <p>“Indian nationals account for nearly 70 per cent of all H-1B visa issued, even though the share of Indian IT companies in the H-1B visa is relatively small,” the minister stated.</p>
      <p>He also added that Indians also accounted for about 93 per cent of all Employment Authorization Document issued to H-4 visa holding spouses of H-1B beneficiaries as per statistics available till December 2017.</p>
      <p>Replying to another question, Muraleedharan said that as per information received, there is a concern across the global IT industry operating in the US over approval rates for H-1B petitions, a higher rate of rejection among IT companies, and cost implications of higher scrutiny and additional requests for evidence.</p>
      <p>Muraleedharan added that according to stats of USCIS, 84.8 per cent of the total H-1B petitions completed in the Fiscal Year 2019 (October 2018-September 2019) were approved, as against 95.7 per cent of the total in the Fiscal Year 2015 (October 2014-September 2015).</p>
