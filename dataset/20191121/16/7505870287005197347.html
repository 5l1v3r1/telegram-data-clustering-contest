      <h1>Amazon’s rare AirPods Pro discount is back in stock</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:29:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>If you have your heart set on AirPods and you want the best cord-free earphones Apple makes, you’re obviously eyeing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=b0c55-20">AirPods Pro</a>. Before you buy them though, there are two things you need to know. First, they will absolutely not be discounted by Apple for Black Friday 2019. Second, they’re already discounted on Amazon! AirPods Pro have been floating in and out of stock all week, and they’re back down to the lowest price yet as of the time of this writing. Of note, shipping estimates are going to slip fast, but don’t take them too seriously. I ordered a pair last week and Amazon said they’d ship within 1-2 months. Guess what: I already got them!</p>
