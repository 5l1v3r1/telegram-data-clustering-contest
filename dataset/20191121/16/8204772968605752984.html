      <h1>Wages to keep growing in Republic, says OECD</h1>
      <h2>Think tank also expects unemployment to keep falling to ‘historically very low levels’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:53:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/barry-o-halloran-7.1010658" target="_blank">Barry O'Halloran</a></address>
      <p>Workers are in line for further pay rises as the Republic’s economy keeps growing, experts predicted in a report published on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) latest report says that assuming a soft Brexit occurs, the Republic’s wealth will continue growing strongly.</p>
      <p>“The unemployment rate will continue to fall to historically very low levels, albeit more slowly, with wage pressures becoming intense,” the Paris-based think tank forecasts.</p>
      <p>OECD figures show that pay grew by 3.5 per cent in the first three months of this year and 3.9 per cent in the final quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>Its report predicts that unemployment will fall to 4.6 per cent in 2021 from 5.3 per cent this year.</p>
      <p>The organisation’s outlook comes days after the State’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Central+Statistics+Office">Central Statistics Office</a> said that a record 2.3 million people were working on the Republic.</p>
      <p>However, the OECD warns that competitiveness and productivity could suffer if prices rise as employers pass on higher wages.</p>
      <p>It also recommends that the Government promote programmes to improve jobless workers’ skills to aid them in returning to the labour force.</p>
      <h3>Brexit talks</h3>
      <p>The report cautions that uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit talks remains high while the risk that the UK could crash out of the EU without a deal is not eliminated.</p>
      <p>“Similarly, further protectionist trade policies elsewhere could have a substantial and abrupt effect on the Irish economy, given its openness to global trade,” the OECD adds.</p>
      <p>Around the world, the OECD says that geopolitical tension, trade conflicts, climate change and China’s sharper-than-expected slowdown, are undermining investment, jobs and incomes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Laurence+Boone">Laurence Boone</a>, its chief economist, said that many threats to global prosperity were structural.</p>
      <p>“Without co-ordination for trade and global taxation, clear policy directions for the energy transition, uncertainty will continue to loom large and damage growth prospects,” he warned.</p>
