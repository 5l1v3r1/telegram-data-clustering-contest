      <h1>Mystery solved after benches wash up in Portishead</h1>
      <h2>A community group asked for information about how they ended up there</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:11:24+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>Two benches mysteriously washed up along the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/portishead">Portishead</a> coastline this week.</p>
      <p>Community group Turn The Tide Portishead asked whether anyone had information about the discovery on social media.</p>
      <p>Following the appeal, the group managed to track the benches back to a pub in Herefordshire along the River Wye called Ye Old Ferrie Inn.</p>
      <p>The pub recently lost a total of 10 benches due to flooding three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Miraculously, two of the benches appeared to have travelled along the River Wye, before ending up joining the River Severn and eventually ending up in Portishead.</p>
      <p>Owner of the Symonds Yat pub Jamie Hicks said: "My friend Martin McBlane was married at Ye Old Ferrie Inn and recognised the benches had washed up in Portishead because he remembered the colour of them.</p>
      <p>"It all happened so quickly, ten of our benches washed away during the flooding and Martin messaged me saying he had seen the benches wash up in Portishead on the Turn the Tide Portishead Facebook page."</p>
      <p>When asked whether he'll leave the benches in Portishead or take them back to Herefordshire, Mr Hicks said he wasn't sure.</p>

      <p>"I don't know. It seems as if people are enjoying sandwiches and coffee and are using all of the benches that have washed up.</p>
      <p>"We might donate it to Turn the Tide. They have a group of volunteers who help clean the beaches by picking up plastic waste."</p>
      <p>The pub is still missing eight benches. Turn the Tide Portishead has urged anyone who may spot the others to let them know.</p>
