      <p>(Nov 21): Xerox Corp on Thursday threatened to go hostile with its US$33.5 billion buyout bid for HP Inc, if the personal computer maker did not agree to a "friendly" discussion before Nov 25.</p>
      <p>HP on Sunday rejected Xerox's offer of US$22 per share, saying it undervalued the company and that it was open to exploring a bid for the U.S. printer maker.</p>
      <p>"Xerox will take its compelling case to create superior value for our respective shareholders directly to your shareholders," the company said in a letter to HP's board.</p>
      <p>HP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Xerox said there will be no financing condition to the completion of its acquisition of HP.</p>
      <p>"We are confused by this reasoning in that your own financial adviser, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, set a US$14 price target with a 'sell' rating for HP's stock, after you announced your restructuring plan," Xerox wrote in its letter. The median price target on HP stock by 15 analysts is US$20.</p>
      <p>Many analysts have said there is merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.</p>
      <p>Xerox made the offer for HP, a company more than three times its size, on Nov 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities.</p>
      <p>Activist investor Carl Icahn, who took over Xerox's board last year, together with fellow billionaire businessman Darwin Deason, said in an interview with the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> last week that he was not set on a particular structure for a deal with HP, as long as a combination is achieved. Icahn has also amassed a 4% stake in HP.</p>
