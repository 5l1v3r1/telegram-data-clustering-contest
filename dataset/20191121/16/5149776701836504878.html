      <h1>Notts County receive loan offers for out of favour stars as Neal Ardley warns of January risk</h1>
      <h2>Magpies are hoping to trim down their squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:19:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:19</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Notts County have received offers to take two players on loan from non-league clubs as boss Neal Ardley warned them there is no guarantee of a Football League move in January.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> boss did not disclose their identities but it is likely to be those who are not involved in his plans such as Matt Tootle, Tom Crawford and Christian Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> told a fans’ forum in midweek that some players have already turned down loan moves away in the hope of getting a move in January when Football League clubs are able to do business again.</p>
      <p>But Ardley insisted there is no guarantee they will get the move they want given it is likely to be a market when supply far outweighs demand.</p>
      <p>“We are trying,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have had one and half offers to take players on loan.</p>
      <p>“I say one and a half because the second offer we haven’t actually had it properly because it’s come through an agent.</p>
      <p>“We have said to the agents and the players that if people want to wait until January then you are facing an open market.</p>
      <p>“You are waiting for all the league players to be available.</p>

      <p>“At the moment, clubs are looking at us and players who aren’t playing because they are going into a busy Christmas schedule and want to top up their squads.</p>
      <p>“It’s an opportunity to get out and play. But if it gets to January why are clubs going to come for them when there are going to be loads more available.</p>
      <p>“We are going to have to be careful of that. It’s not just their careers, but they must hate not playing on Saturday. I feel for them because I’ve been there myself.</p>
      <p>“It’s got to be tough. You go shopping with the wife when the team is away from home and it feels alien.</p>
      <p>“I feel the pain they are going through, but unfortunately when you have a big squad. You can’t keep 26 people happy.”</p>
