      <h1>ISD entreats Muslims to turn out massively for referendum</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:45:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Asante, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Oforikrom (Ash), Nov. 20, GNA - Nana Akrasi Sarpong, Ashanti Regional Director of the Information Services Department (ISD), has called on the public to turn out in their numbers for the December 17, 2019, Referendum on Article 55 (3).</p>
      <p>They should take keen interest in the Referendum for the necessary constitutional amendments to be made, in a bid to strengthening an all-inclusive and participatory governance system.</p>
      <p>“We should aspire for consistency in the nation’s democratic dispensation and structures,” Nana Akrasi Sarpong said adding that the involvement of political parties in the election of assembly and unit committee members would help nurture multi-party democracy.       </p>
      <p>He was addressing Muslims at the ‘55th Annual Celebration of the Maulid Nabiyi, (SAW), an Islamic sacred event commemorating the birth of the Prophet Mohammed, founder of Islam, held at Oforikrom in the Oforkrom Municipality of the Ashanti Region.</p>
      <p>The Regional Information Director said a ‘Yes’ vote was prerequisite for laying good foundation for people-centred development at the grassroots level</p>
      <p>This is because leaders entrusted with the responsibility of managing state resources, he said, would be more accountable to the citizenry who had the greater mandate in choosing them.</p>
      <p>Voter turn-out of at least 40 per cent, and out of this 75 per cent voting ‘Yes’, is required to effect the constitutional amendment of the article.</p>
      <p>This would help to waive the powers conferred on the Presidency under the 1992 Constitution to appoint Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs).</p>
      <p>The ISD, acting under the auspices of the Ministry of Information, therefore, took advantage of the occasion to educate the Muslim participants on the essence of the referendum, as well as the District Level Elections (DLEs).</p>
      <p>Nana Akrasi Sarpong said they would continue to engage stakeholders for massive participation in the referendum.</p>
      <p>He stressed that the ISD had so far done substantial educational campaigns to keep the people abreast of the referendum.</p>
      <p>On the perceived demerits of electing MMDCEs on partisan basis, the Regional ISD Director said those concerns would be resolved with the consequential amendments and reviews to existing laws.</p>
