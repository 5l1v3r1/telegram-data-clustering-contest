      <p>John Conner III, who starred in the Lifetime dance reality show <i>Bring It</i>, plead guilty to criminal exposure to HIV, statutory rape by an authority figure, and solicitation of a minor. </p>
      <p>Investigators say Conner was 26 met a 16-year-old boy on the internet in 2015, and the two then met up and had unprotected sex, where the teen unknowingly contracted HIV from Conner, who had been diagnosed in 2012. Still unaware, the teen joined Conner's dance team and continued their sexual relationship. A year later, the teen was informed that Conner is HIV positive, which is when he went to his parents who suggested that he get tested for HIV. His results were positive. </p>
      <p>Conner has two similar cases pending with sexual partners, ages 17 and 24. He is scheduled to be sentenced on December 20. </p>
