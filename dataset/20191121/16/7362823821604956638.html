      <p>The ex-boyfriend of a missing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> woman sent several aggressive and profanity-laced messages to her the day before she disappeared and was found with mysterious marks around his neck when questioned by police days later, prosecutors revealed in court this week.</p>
      <p>John D. Ozbilgen, a 29-year-old Freehold Township resident who was recently fired from his job as a stockbroker, sent Stephanie Parze 10 unanswered Facebook messages and texts, including one that called her “f------ c---,” in a matter of nine minutes the day before she was last heard from, Assistant Prosecutor Caitlyn Sidley said according to the <a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/local/courts/2019/11/19/freehold-missing-woman-stephanie-parze-john-ozbilgen-free-from-jail/4205620002/">Asbury Park Press.</a></p>

      <p>In addition to accusing Parze of always making the “relationship suck,” Sidley added that Ozbilgen was also observed with marks around his neck by investigators.</p>

      <p>Despite having only been named a person of interest, Ozbilgen appeared in court Tuesday for a detention hearing on a child pornography charge that was brought against him after police searched his home in connection with Parze’s disappearance.</p>
      <p>Police found 10 images of child pornography, which included sexually graphic images of toddlers. Tuesday’s hearing was to determine if Ozbilgen should be released on those charges.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors brought up his connection to Parze’s disappearance to prove why he would be a threat to the community if released.</p>
      <p>It was also revealed that Parze filed a simple assault domestic violence complaint against Ozbilgen for a Sept. 23 incident where he reportedly struck her in the head, the Asbury Park Press reported, citing authorities.</p>
