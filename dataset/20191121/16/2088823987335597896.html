      <p>22nd Century Group's stock rebounded Thursday after the Clarence cigarette manufacturer said it would continue its push to gain regulatory approval for its very low nicotine cigarettes even after federal regulators backed off plans to force tobacco companies to drastically reduce addictive nicotine in cigarettes.</p>
      <p>The decision announced Wednesday by the Department of Health and Human Services to drop a proposal unveiled two years ago to cut the level of nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels sent 22nd Century Group's shares tumbling by 40%.</p>
      <p>But the shares rebounded Thursday after company officials said they were disappointed by the decision, but still optimistic about gaining regulatory approval for its very low nicotine cigarettes, which they view as a potential product to help smokers quit.</p>
      <p>“22nd Century Group is disappointed that FDA appears to have delayed its efforts to enact a product standard rule to lower the amount of nicotine in all cigarettes sold in the United States to non-addictive levels,” said Cliff Fleet, the company's CEO, in a statement. “We believe such a rule, when enacted, will dramatically reduce the death and disease caused by cigarette smoking.</p>
      <p>“We are encouraged, however, that FDA publicly stated that the agency continues to work on the nicotine-reduction rule. Furthermore, we remain optimistic about the approval of our Modified Risk Tobacco Product application for very-low nicotine content cigarettes," he said. "We believe this application is moving quickly through the Agency’s scientific review process, and we plan to launch this product in the U.S. after we receive an MRTP marketing order for this application.”</p>
      <p>22nd Century is using its technology that can manipulate nicotine levels in tobacco plants to develop very low nicotine cigarettes in hopes of gaining regulatory approval for their use as a smoking cessation aid.</p>
      <p>Its shares rose by more than a third in midday trading, rising 31 cents to $1.14.</p>
      <p>Other groups, including the American Heart Association, criticized the FDA's decision. The withdrawal “would have an enormous impact on the millions of cigarette smokers who are currently addicted to products that kill when used as intended,” the heart association said in a statement.</p>
