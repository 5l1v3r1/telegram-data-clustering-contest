      <p>Unai Emery has admitted he is surprised by <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/tottenham-appoints-jose-mourinho-as-head-coach/">Jose Mourinho taking up Tottenham’s coaching job</a> from Mauricio Pochettino as the latter did an amazing job.</p>
      <p>Concise News reported that the Premier League club on Tuesday<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/19/epl-tottenham-sack-manager-pochettino/"> sacked Pochettino</a> after a series of <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/10/05/livescore-brighton-beat-spurs-3-0-to-increase-pressure-on-pochettino/">poor run in the domestic race.</a></p>
      <p>And on Wednesday morning, Tottenham named Pochettino as the coach of the team.</p>
      <p>Emery who is the coach of Tottenham’s North London rivals Arsenal on Thursday, however, said he is shocked following the development.</p>
      <p>According to him, “I think it’s a surprise how it finished with Pochettino. ‘I don’t know exactly why and how it’s going to change their performance.</p>
      <p>“‘[Jose] is a very good coach, his career is strong with titles and experience and I think also Pochettino working in Tottenham was amazing.’</p>
      <p>On whether he was surprised at Pochettino’s sacking, he said: “Yes, for me it was a surprise.</p>
      <p>“Maybe the last matches they didn’t achieve a good result but in the last year with Pochetinno was perfect.</p>
      <p>“They decided to change and I don’t know the reason but we have our way and they have their way. We want to keep that distance [ahead of them in the Premier League table].”</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s first game will be against London rivals West Ham on Saturday as Arsenal battle Southampton at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
