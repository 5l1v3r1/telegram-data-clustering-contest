      <p>Yeoman Haylage has been nominated for a rural Oscar.  </p>
      <p>The annual Countryside Alliance Awards are now open to public nomination, and Yeoman Haylage based near Tiverton have announced they are among the nominees.</p>
      <p>The awards - now in their 15th year - have seen thousands of outstanding small hard-working businesses recognised, and are the Countryside Alliance’s annual celebration of British food and farming, enterprise and heritage culminating at a champions’ reception at the House of Lords in June 2020. </p>
      <p>The awards are driven by public nomination, offering customers the chance to tell them why their favourite businesses are worthy of national acclaim. Judges then look for evidence of great produce, customer service and innovation as well as stories of how businesses serve their communities.</p>

      <p>Yeoman Haylage is a family run business started by John Bosley and now joined by his daughter and son in law Liz and Nick Shepherd.</p>
      <p>With roots in farming and horses, they take pride in producing top-quality ryegrass haylage for the equine industry, grown on the rolling Devon hills at Thongsleigh Farm near Tiverton.</p>
      <p>Since starting in 1999 John, Liz and Nick have seen demand increase and their business grow as they distribute their haylage from the South West to the South East, throughout Wales and areas stretching as far as Shropshire. The haylage is used by some of the top names in equestrian sports including Olympic eventing rider Kitty King from Chippenham, a hopeful for the Tokyo Olympics next year. </p>
      <p>John Bosley said: “Among the key priorities for this innovative business is to fully endorse keeping our carbon footprint to a minimum. We also support the local economy by buying their grass seed, machinery, bale wrap, materials and equipment needed from local suppliers and employing their staff e recognise as being vital to the success of their business, also locally including our agronomist who ensures the quality is spot on.</p>
      <p>“Customer Service features high on the list of priorities as we like to make sure that everyone has their delivery on time and is 100 per cent happy with the product, putting in long hours including weekends.</p>
      <p>“As a retired college lecturer in agriculture, I am keen to share his expertise in farming, encouraging young people to seek a career in farming and takes college students on placement.</p>
      <p>“Liz, Nick and I were delighted to find out that we had been nominated for a Rural Oscar. We love what we do and go to great lengths to make sure our haylage is of the best quality.</p>
      <p>“Customer satisfaction is everything to us, and we are proud that we support our local economy here in Devon by using all of our local suppliers in the South West. A testament to the product we are so proud of is that our customers repeatedly tell us how much they love the quality of Yeoman Haylage and how much their horses and ponies enjoy it. This is why we do what we do.”</p>
      <p>Countryside Alliance Awards Director Sarah Lee added: “These awards provide a cause for celebration in a time of great uncertainty in the countryside.</p>
      <p>“They were set up to provide a voice and a platform for the rural businesses that form the hearts of their communities. Our local produce is second to none, and there are many community heroes and businesses worthy of national recognition, so please get involved and nominate today.” </p>
      <p>Nominations can be made online until December 8 at  <a href="https://www.countryside-alliance.org/rural-awards/caawards">countryside-alliance.org/rural-awards/caawards</a> .</p>
