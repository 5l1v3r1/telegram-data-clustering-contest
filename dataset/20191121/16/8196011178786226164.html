      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been charged in a series of corruption scandals.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit issued an indictment on Thursday charging Mr Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and bribery.</p>

      <p>Mr Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and said he is a victim of a witch-hunt. He is due to make a statement on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>But the decision to charge him is likely to deal a heavy blow to Mr Netanyahu’s hopes of remaining in office.</p>
      <p>Israel has recently held two inconclusive elections, with a third likely amid an ongoing political impasse.</p>
      <p>The allegations against Mr Netanyahu include suspicions that he accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends, offered to trade favours with a newspaper publisher, and used his influence to help a wealthy telecoms magnate in exchange for favourable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
