      <h1>Become a giant or tiny cowboy with this Red Dead Redemption 2 PC mod</h1>

      <p>If you want to roam the range as a tiny cowboy or a gigantic one, then you’ll want to take a look at this Red Dead Redemption 2 PC mod.</p>
      <p>Lenny’s Simple Trainer is a mod for Red Dead Redemption 2 that lets you do all sorts of things in the game, and its recent update lets you play as a gigantic cowboy or a toy-sized one.</p>
      <p>If you recall, the mod also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/11/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-first-nude-mod-npcs/">lets you run around naked in the game</a>, allows your character to have any weapon, lets you play as any NPC in the game, various animals, and much more. You can even call in a deadly flying eagle “to rain death from above” if you wish.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mod-rdr.com/files/file/7-lennys-simple-trainer/">With the new update</a>, you are able to scale your character and horse to large or small, and even choose a gender when spawning horses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-21-red-dead-redemption-2-pc-mod-lets-you-supersize-your-horse">As Eurogamer notes</a>, when gigantic, it can be slightly difficult to play because the camera doesn’t adjust to the scale very well. But using the free camera in photo mode works when taking images when super-sized. Just keep that in mind if you decide to play that way.</p>
      <p>Hit up the link to Eurogamer for a full rundown of the mod.</p>
