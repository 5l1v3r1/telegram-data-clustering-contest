      <h1>Grace Millane’s accused killer took ‘trophy’ photos of her naked body: prosecutors</h1>

      <p>The depraved Tinder date who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/uk-backpacker-was-strangled-to-death-by-tinder-date-prosecutor/">strangled backpacker Grace Millane during sex</a> took “trophy” photos of her naked body — before watching hardcore porn in the room, his trial was told on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old New Zealand man — who cannot be identified by order of the court — has claimed British tourist Millane, 21, died accidentally in December last year while carrying out her fantasies of violent sex.</p>
      <p>However, he had <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/grisly-details-emerge-in-case-of-slain-backpacker-grace-millane/">strangled her for between 5 and 10 minutes</a> to kill her, prosecutor Brian Dickey said during closing arguments in Auckland High Court, <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12287185">according to the New Zealand Herald</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s not safe sex play that killed Grace Millane, it’s strangulation,” Dickey said, insisting there was a “compelling case of murder.”</p>

      <p>He said the accused must have felt Millane’s “limp and lifeless” body but decided to carry on. “If that’s not reckless murder … then someone will have to explain to me what is,” Dickey said.</p>
      <p>The accused’s phone activity shows him Googling the woodland area where he finally buried her body in a suitcase, before watching porn, the report states.</p>
      <p>He then took several photographs of Millane’s body — including closeups of her genitalia — which the prosecutor called “powerful, powerful evidence,” according to the Herald.</p>
      <p>“He has memorialized it for himself … The ultimate triumph for the defendant over Grace Millane. His trophy photographs,” Dickey told the court, saying the defendant then watched more porn.</p>
      <p>The accused’s legal team had argued there was no proof that the images were taken while she was dead — which was just as damning, the prosecutor said, given that they came after searching the dump site.</p>
      <p>“Either he planned to kill her and looked for a disposal site or she was dead,” Dickey said. “There’s really no way out of the photographs for the defense.”</p>
      <p>Defense lawyer Ian Brookie, however, insisted that Millane and the accused had taken nudes of each other, and said there was no evidence that she had fought back while being strangled.</p>
      <p>“She may have, for a brief period of time, gone unconscious and he may not have noticed,” he said, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/killed-backpacker-grace-millane-was-into-choking-bdsm-court-evidence/">insisting it was consensual BDSM</a>. “He’s really just a young man who’s prepared to do what his sexual partners want him to do in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>“It was an accidental death that took place during sexual activity that, if done incorrectly or while intoxicated, can go wrong,” he insisted.</p>
      <p>Judge Simon Moore will sum up the case Friday morning before the jury considers its verdict.</p>
