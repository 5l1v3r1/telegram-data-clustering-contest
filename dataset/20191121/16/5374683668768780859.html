      <p>Yisrael Beyteinu leader Avigdor Liberman was interviewed at the <i>Jerusalem Post Diplomatic Conference</i> on Thursday afternoon, where he discussed the political deadlock which resulted after both Binyamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz failed to form a coalition.</p>
      <p>"We are waiting for a national unity government. It's clear that both of them, Kachol Laven (Blue and White) and Likud, have enough seats, 65 seats, even without Yisrael Beyteinu," Liberman said.</p>
      <p>He said that it came down to the Blue and White and Likud's "readiness to sit and to establish a government and to avoid the next elections."</p>
      <p>"In any case, we will support a unity government even if we are out of the coalition.</p>
      <p>"But it looks very personal, and it's impossible to resolve real personal pursuits, personal issues," he observed.</p>
      <p>"I think both of them (Netanyahu and Gantz) understand that the people Israel need a stable government. Enough with the elections. Everybody is exhausted and tired. Even with new elections, I don't see any dramatic change in our political map."</p>
