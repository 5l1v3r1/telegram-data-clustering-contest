      <h1>Cat missing for five years turns up 1,200 miles away from home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:39:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Matt Drake</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cats">cat</a> missing for five years was reportedly found 1,200 miles away from home and reunited with its owner.</p>
      <p>Viktor Usov, from <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Portland">Portland</a>, Oregon, assumed the worst after his cat Sasha went missing.</p>
      <p>But he received a call from an animal shelter in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/santa-fe">Santa Fe</a>, New Mexico, who told him his six-year-old, long-haired black cat had been found.</p>
      <p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/20/us/missing-cat-found-1200-miles-trnd/index.html">According to</a> CNN, he said he thought at the time: “No way. That can’t be my cat. That must be a malfunctioning system.”</p>
      <p>Although the cat was discovered wandering the streets without a collar, the shelter was able to trace its owner by scanning for a microchip, public relations officer Murad Kirdar told CNN.</p>
      <p>Sasha was flown back to Portland this week and reunited with its shocked owner.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50496781">According to the</a> BBC<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50496781?ns_campaign=bbcnews&amp;ns_mchannel=social&amp;ocid=socialflow_facebook&amp;ns_source=facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR0aZPuyZa36G-lo_7Kkh4wrtJDSeY_nZTmaxfAESQqPefkkebsTsnUNMMA">,</a> Mr Usov said: “I couldn’t believe it.</p>
      <p>“We thought the worst, but when we received the call, we were so thankful Sasha was alive and well.”</p>
      <p>Just how and why the cat ended up in Santa Fe remains a mystery, but Mr Usov said he believes his cat “hitched a ride”.</p>
      <p>He added: “I guess I want to think he was on a great American adventure.”</p>
      <p>Mr Kirdar said the story showed the importance of microchipping pets as it is the only form of permanent identification.</p>
