      <p>The <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/samsung-mobile-design-competition-2019/">Samsung Mobile Design Competition</a> asked designers to submit proposals for designs that would elevate the experience of using a Samsung Galaxy mobile device. Alongside the accessories category, there was also a category seeking new mobile wallpaper designs for Samsung Galaxy devices.</p>
      <p>The top five designs and the overall winners in each category were selected by a jury including designers Stefan Scholten and Paul Austin, as well as executives from Samsung's IT and mobile communications division and Dezeen's editor-at-large Amy Frearson.</p>
      <p>The results were announced at <a href="https://www.samsungdeveloperconference.com/">Samsung Developer Conference</a>, an annual event organised by Samsung in California, which brings together thousands of developers and creators who are working with new and emerging technologies.</p>
      <p>Prototypes of the top five mobile accessory and wallpaper designs were also on display at the event, which allows visitors to receive exclusive access to Samsung's latest ideas – spanning mobile devices and smart technologies. The top three designers in each competition category also attended to explain their concepts and promote their work to conference visitors.</p>
      <p>"At Samsung, whether it's through product design or user-experience design, we're constantly exploring ways to take users' experiences with our Galaxy devices to the next level and to shape the next wave of Galaxy experiences," said Samsung.</p>
      <p>This movie was filmed by Dezeen for <a href="https://www.samsung.com/">Samsung</a> in London and San Jose.</p>
