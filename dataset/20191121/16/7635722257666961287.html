        <b>Social media site Twitter is giving all its users the ability to hide replies to their tweets on the platform.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Plans for the measure were<b> <a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/twitter-users-soon-able-hide-replies-832812">first announced back in March</a>.</b></p>
      <p>Anyone can choose to hide replies to their tweets, and can see hidden replies, by tapping the grey icon that will appear on the tweets.</p>
      <p>The company says this gives the user more control over the conversations they start - but people can still see the entire conversation.</p>

      <p>It says: "Everyone should feel safe and comfortable while talking on Twitter. To make this happen, we need to change how conversations work on our service.</p>
      <p>"Currently, repliers can shift the topic or tone of a discussion and derail what you and your audience want to talk about.</p>
      <p>"To give you more control over the conversations you start, we tested the option for you to hide replies to your tweets.</p>
      <blockquote>"We learned that the feature is a useful new way to manage your conversations. Today, we're making this available to everyone globally."</blockquote>
      <p>During tests it carried out, Twitter revealed that people mostly hide replies they think are irrelevant, off-topic or annoying.</p>
      <p>While some 85% of the people who hide replies are not using 'Block' or 'Mute' options.</p>
      <p>People were also curious to see how public figures, like those in politics and journalism, would use this update.</p>
      <p>Twitter says that so far, they are not hiding replies very often.</p>
      <p>In Canada, 27% of people who had their tweets hidden said they would re-consider how they interact with others in the future.</p>

      <p>Also they thought it was a helpful way to manage what they saw, similar to muted keywords.</p>
      <p>The website says it is working on new controls and more clarity around the rules of conversation spaces.</p>
      <p>It will soon be launching a new hide replies 'endpoint' - so developers can build additional conversation management tools.</p>
      <p>The option to hide replies is rolling out globally on Twitter's website, iOS, Android and Twitter Lite.</p>
