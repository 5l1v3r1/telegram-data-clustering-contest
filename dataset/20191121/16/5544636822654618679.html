      <p>A Counsel to the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (<a href="http://concisenews.global/biafra-news">IPOB</a>), Nnamdi Kanu, Barrister Aloy Ejimakor has expressed his reservations about the reported feud between former President Goodluck Jonathan and sitting governor of Bayelsa state, Seriake Dickson, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>The legal practitioner went proverbial, warning that “when two grasshoppers fight to death, it is the crow that gets to feast on their carcass.”</p>
      <p>Ejimakor wrote on his known Twitter handle on Thursday: “Goodluck Jonathan &amp; Gov Dickson should’ve known that when 2 brothers fight to death, a STRANGER inherits their property or when 2 grasshoppers fight to death, it is the crow that gets to feast on their carcass”. That’s the summary of the electoral self-immolation in Bayelsa.”</p>

      <p>Earlier, the IPOB apologist <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/biafra-nnamdi-kanus-counsel-tackles-wailers-ipob-leaders-haters/">aimed a dig at those complaining about the outcome of the just-concluded elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states</a>.</p>
      <p>He also criticised those hating on Kanu “for daring to suggest solutions.”</p>
