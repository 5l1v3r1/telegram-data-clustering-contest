      <p>Black Leopards boast one of the deadliest finishers in the PSL in the form of Mwape Musonda.</p>
      <p>While there’s no question about his finishing, how does the Zambian fare in the fashion game?</p>
      <p>Musonda hasn’t quite been able to recapture the form that saw him rip through the goalscoring charts last season, which saw him claim the Absa Premiership Golden Boot gong. </p>

      <p>Two goals in seven starts is a far cry for a striker of his calibre. Though it must be mentioned that his relatively slow start to the season can be attributed to off-field politics involving a possible transfer.</p>
      <p>Off-the-field, the 29-year-old is cool as ice and cleans up nicely when it comes to his fashion game.</p>
      <p>A typical designer jeans and sneaker kind of guy, we take a look at some of Musonda’s coolest looks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you think Musonda can recapture the form he displayed last season?</b>
