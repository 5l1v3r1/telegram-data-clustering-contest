      <h1>GDP Growth Rate To Further Deteriorate To 4.7 Per Cent In Q2 Of FY2020: ICRA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:31:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p>Ratings agency ICRA expects India's growth rate to further slowdown to 4.7 per cent in Q2 FY2020, due to weak industrial output.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the ratings agency expects a further deterioration in the growth rate of India's GDP and the gross value added (GVA) at basic prices in year-on-year terms to 4.7 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively, in Q2 FY2020, from 5 per cent and 4.9 per cent, respectively, in Q1 FY2020.</p>
      <p>However, sectors such as agriculture and services may be able to "maintain the growth rate recorded in Q1 FY2020".</p>
      <p>"With subdued domestic demand, investment activity, and non-oil merchandise exports weighing upon volume expansion, manufacturing growth is expected to decelerate further from the marginal 0.6 per cent in Q1 FY2020," said ICRA's principal economist Aditi Nayar.</p>
      <p>"To some extent, lower raw material costs would bolster earnings, and may prevent manufacturing GVA from slipping into a YoY contraction in Q2 FY2020."</p>
