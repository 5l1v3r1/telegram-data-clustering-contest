      <p>Former Netherlands international Wesley Sneijder, who retired from the game in August, has insisted that he could have been on par with Messi and Ronaldo if he had applied himself properly during his career.</p>
      <p>"I have to be honest and admit that I could have been mentioned in the same breath as Messi and Ronaldo if I had been 100% committed. I know that," Sneijder told<i> Fox Sports NL.</i></p>
      <p>"But I did not want to do that, and I have no regrets about it. It's not that I didn't have it in me, but I simply didn't want to do it.</p>
      <p>"I enjoyed my footballing career as it was, both on and off the pitch. I won every trophy I could win at club level, so I have no regrets at all. I am a team player and I like to be successful as a team."</p>

      <p>Sneijder was controversially overlooked for the Ballon d'Or in 2010, when Messi and FC Barcelona teammates Xavi and Andres Iniesta claimed all three top spots, despite the Dutchman winning the UEFA Champions League with Inter and reaching the 2010 FIFA World Cup final with his national team.</p>
      <p>"People still approach me to tell me that they feel I should have won the Ballon d'Or in 2010, but I keep telling them that winning the Champions League was nicer than an individual trophy," the 35-year-old added.</p>
      <p>"Of course, it would have been the icing on the cake, but it's satisfying enough that people tell me I should have won it."</p>

      <p>Sneijder enjoyed a stellar career that saw him turn out for the likes of Ajax Amsterdam, Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Galatasaray and Al-Gharafa, and retired as the Netherlands' record appearance holder with 134 caps to his name.</p>
