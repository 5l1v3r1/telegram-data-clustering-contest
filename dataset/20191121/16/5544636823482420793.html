      <p>According to Tuface, the state of the country has become worst in the hands of the present administration.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, the singer wrote “Naija system is a total joke, criminals have hijacked Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Men and women that have dedicated their time to make sure that Nigeria will carry last. No shame, no dignity, no honour.</p>

      <p>“I pray the young men that have entered the system will do their best to influence positive change,”  Tuface said.</p>
