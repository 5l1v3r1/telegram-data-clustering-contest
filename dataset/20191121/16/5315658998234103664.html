      <p>David Clark should hold a ministerial inquiry into PHARMAC’s decision to switch to the generic form of epilepsy drug lamotrigine which may have resulted in four deaths, National’s Health spokesperson Michael Woodhouse says.</p>
      <p>“PHARMAC’s decision to fund only one brand of lamotrigine and the subsequent reversal of that decision raises more questions than it answers.</p>
      <p>“Given four people have died since the initial brand switch, the public and patients deserve to know whether or not those deaths were as a result of the compulsory switch to Logem, the generic form of lamotrigine.</p>
      <p>“We know that Medsafe had raised concerns about the brand switch before it went ahead.</p>
      <p>“What we need to know now is whether the Minister was involved in the decision-making around lamotrigine, which would call into question PHARMAC’s independence, or whether Medsafe raised further concerns about the number of adverse reactions they were seeing.</p>
      <p>“A ministerial inquiry is the appropriate way of getting answers to these questions.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately the question also needs to be asked about whether Dr Clark’s decision to increase PHARMAC funding by an amount which barely covers inflation is forcing risky drug-switches on the basis of making savings. By comparison, National increased PHARMAC funding by an average of $24 million each year we were in government.</p>
      <p>“The public deserves answers to these questions so we can continue to have confidence in PHARMAC’s independence and decision-making.”</p>
