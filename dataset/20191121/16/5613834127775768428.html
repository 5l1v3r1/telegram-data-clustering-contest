      <p><b>Bradley Cooper</b>, <b>Toni Collette</b>, <b>Cate Blanchett</b>,<b> Willem Dafoe</b>,<b> David Strathairn </b>and <b>Rooney Mara</b> were recently set to star in<b> Guillermo del Toro</b>‘s <b><i>Nightmare Alley</i></b>, an adaptation of the novel by William Lindsay Gresham, and we’ve learned via <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/guillermo-del-toro-nightmare-alley-holt-mccallany-mindhunter-fox-searchlight-bradley-cooper-cate-blanchett-1202791278/">Deadline</a> this week that<b> Holt McCallany</b> (Netflix’s “Mindhunter”) has also joined the impressive ensemble cast.</p>
      <p>The site details, “McCallany will play Anderson, a get-the-job-done bruiser with more going on than is first apparent from his tough guy persona.”</p>
      <p>Published in 1946, the novel spawned its first feature film just one year later starring Tyrone Power and Joan Blondell, and this new take on the material for Fox Searchlight has been written by del Toro and <b>Kim Morgan</b>.</p>
      <p>The original novel is described as “<i>a study of the lowest depths of showbiz and its sleazy inhabitants – the dark, shadowy world of a second rate carnival filled with hustlers, scheming grifters, and Machiavellian femmes fatales</i>.” The 1947 movie chronicles “<i>The rise and fall of Stanton Carlisle, a mentalist whose lies and deceit prove to be his downfall</i>.”</p>
