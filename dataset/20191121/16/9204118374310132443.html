      <h1>Shell and AMG sign MOU for potential catalyst-recycling facility in Saudi Arabia</h1>

      <p>The Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA), Shell Overseas Services Ltd. (Shell; <a href="http://www.shell.com/">www.shell.com</a>) and Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GacOSvIxdlH3RK4MUEdXKiDfiHno3MXRetA6TrCWl_nC0PZ7V2V49qDwGM3IbZqTC9Ol34ayDUDYzUib9va6Vw==">www.amg-nv.com</a>) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to evaluate the potential for construction and operation, subject to regulatory approvals, of a spent catalyst recycling facility in Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia. The signing took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Shell and AMG <a href="https://www.chemengonline.com/shell-and-amg-form-jv-for-catalyst-recycling/">recently announced the formation of a joint venture</a> focused on catalyst recycling.</p>
      <p>The MOU will allow SAGIA, Shell and AMG to explore the feasibility of building a world class facility to reclaim valuable metals by recycling spent residue upgrading catalysts generated by refineries in Saudi Arabia and the surrounding region. Residue upgrading catalysts help refineries upgrade the bottom of the oil barrel into more valuable products, including generation of petrochemicals feedstocks. Such a facility would help maximise the benefits from the Kingdom’s natural resources while addressing the need to provide environmentally responsible management of spent residue upgrading catalysts.</p>
      <p> “AMG is excited to provide cutting edge recycling technologies for treating refinery waste in Saudi Arabia. The recycling process also allows for the extraction of specialty alloys from spent catalysts for use by the steel market. Reclamation of these alloys in the recycling process allows steel manufacturers to benefit from a low CO2 method of sourcing the alloys as an alternative to mining. It is also the basis for building stationary batteries used for grid stabilization for the growing renewable energy sector in Saudi Arabia. All of that is in line with AMG’s vision to enable CO2 reduction through its technologies and products,” said Heinz Schimmelbusch.</p>
      <p>The MOU will provide a framework for conducting the required studies to assess the commercial feasibility of this proposed project and, subject to regulatory approvals, the potential construction of a spent catalyst recycling facility in the region.</p>
