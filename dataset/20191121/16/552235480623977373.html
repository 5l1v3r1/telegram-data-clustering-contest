      <p>The 1st Shotts Girls Brigade is celebrating being 85 years old.</p>
      <p>And the company, which still meets regularly on a Wednesday night at Calderhead Erskine Church Hall, is having a number of events to mark the occasion.</p>
      <p>Heather Connelly, from the Girls Brigade, said: “We are a busy company have some events coming up soon such as ‘Wee Sleep Out’ in the Guild Room for the homeless charity Social Bite and a trip to Five Sister Zoo Illuminations in December.</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to our annual events, a trip to the pantomime in Motherwell and the award ceremony at the end of the year in the church. We have a lot to do this year.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Having fun is at the heart of what we want to provide for the girls and over the years, we have gone on many exciting adventures which have provided this.</p>
      <p>“Our biggest one to date was the trip to Paris in 1993 organised by our then Captain Mrs Sneddon. Other trips to Belgium, Netherlands and London have been enjoyed by many of our members. “More locally we have enjoyed time at camp in Guay near Dunkeld, Whithaugh Park and Lockerbie Manor. Adventures have also consisted of trips with other Brigade companies in the area to Strathclyde Park, M&amp;D’s, Edinburgh Zoo and Almondvalley Farm Park.</p>
      <p>“Competitions have always been a big part of our events and Shotts girls have travelled all over Scotland to compete in netball, swimming events, krypton factor, quizzes and before the great British Bake off 1st Shotts were blazing a trail with our own baking and cake decorating competitions.”</p>
      <p>In the past, explorers would be learning how to set a dining table, juniors would be maze marching and brigadiers would be learning to knit. Fast forward to now and the girls are learning about social media, making slime and modelling from Lego.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To recognise the girl’s achievements at the end of each GB session, the girls receive awards in recognition of their achievements.</p>
      <p>One award which has evolved with time but remains the highest achievement in the Girls Brigade is the Queens Award.</p>
      <p>Heather added: “We have been lucky in Shotts and have had over 40 young women achieve this award which has brought personal fulfilment, developing skills and encourages individuals to reach high to achieve personal goals and ambitions. In addition many members have gained Bronze, Silver and Gold Duke of Edinburgh awards. These trips and Awards have given lots of girl’s memories to last a lifetime.”</p>
