      <p>Koforidua, Nov. 20, GNA - Mr George Kwame Darko, a 45-year old craftsman at Nsukwao, a suburb of Koforidua, has appealed to government and the National Board for Small Scale Industries for support to enable him to produce more for export.</p>
      <p>He said he had engaged in handmade crafts such as wall clocks, photo frames and bedside lamps for the past 10 years, yet was not able to market them due to lack of support.</p>
      <p>Mr Darko made the appeal in an interview with the Ghana News Agency during the just ended National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFAC) 2019, held in Koforidua.</p>
      <p>He said he used wood and waste products including sawdust to produce those items and that support in terms high-tech equipment would help him to produce more for the local market and for export.</p>
      <p>Mr Darko said given the needed assistance, he could train the youth and engage same to create employment in the Arts and Culture industry.</p>
      <p>He said though sales were not encouraging during the exhibition at the Festival, he was hopeful that the contacts made would bring him more customers and corporate organisations to patromise his products.</p>
