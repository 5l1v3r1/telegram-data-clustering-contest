      <p>For the first time in Israeli history, the country's ceremonial president announced no candidate has been able to form a government.</p>
      <p>Reuven Rivlin informed parliament on Thursday neither Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/benjamin-netanyahu.html">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> nor his chief challenger, retired military chief <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/israel-benny-gantz-political-novice-oust-netanyahu-191022112028845.html">Benny Gantz</a>, have completed the task of building a coalition in the allotted timeframe.</p>
      <p>The formal expiration of the presidential mandate kicks off the final 21-day window before new elections must be called.</p>

      <p>Rivlin called it a "miserable political situation" and pleaded with legislators to find some form of compromise.</p>
      <p>"These are harsh dark days in the annals of the state of Israel," he said.</p>
      <p>"In the coming 21 days, there will be no 'bloc' or 'party'. Each and every person will sit with their conscience and will have to answer one question: What is my duty towards Israel?"</p>
      <p>Speaking from Jerusalem, Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett said should the Knesset succeed in recommending someone to form a government, that person will have a further 14 days to try to form a coalition.</p>
      <p>"It's what one newspaper here referred to as injury time in this entire process," Fawcett said.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, Gantz, or any other sitting legislator can hypothetically present the backing of a majority of parliament's 120 members in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>But given the prolonged stalemate and unsuccessful mediation efforts, it increasingly appears the country is headed towards an unprecedented third election in less than a year.</p>
      <p>Fawcett said a third election is "extremely unpopular" among the Israeli public, but there has been little pressure to convince Netanyahu to go second in a rotating premiership with Gantz.</p>
      <p>"Gantz has also said he can't serve under a prime minister facing indictment," Fawcett said, referring to possible indictments that Netanyahu faces from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/israeli-pm-netanyahu-pre-trial-corruption-hearings-191002083346777.html">three corruption cases.</a></p>
      <p>Israel's Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit said he would announce his decision on whether to indict Netanyahu over alleged corruption at a news conference at 7:30pm (17:30 GMT).</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html">Israel</a>'s longest-serving leader, has denied any wrongdoing in the three corruption cases, saying he is a victim of a political witch-hunt.</p>
      <p>He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <h3>Leadership contest</h3>
      <p>Within Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party there were stirrings of internal dissent, with two of its 32 legislators saying they would now favour a leadership contest.</p>
      <p>One prospect is Gideon Saar, Netanyahu's rival, who a few weeks ago said <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/israel-gideon-saar-challenges-lengthy-netanyahu-likud-rule-191008055708744.html">he was ready</a> for a leadership challenge.</p>
      <p>"Today, he says he wants to see a leadership contest if there is going to be a third election," Fawcett said.</p>
      <p>Many citizens voiced resignation and rancour at a deadlock that has deepened worries over economic and national security matters.</p>
      <p>"We've had enough of you! Let us know when you make a decision," read the top headline on the mass-circulation Israel Hayom, alongside pictures of Netanyahu and Gantz, as well as Avigdor Lieberman - a far-right political kingmaker.</p>
