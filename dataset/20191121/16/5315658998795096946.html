      <p>Police are aware of discussions on social media about plans for a large gathering of young people in Auckland this Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>This follows a large disorder incident at Mission Bay Reserve last Friday afternoon where a number of youths were arrested for disorder.</p>
      <p>We are planning accordingly and there will be an increased Police presence in the area as well as on trains and at train stations throughout Tāmaki Makaurau.</p>
      <p>Police will not tolerate violent or disorderly behaviour.</p>
      <p>We have been in discussions with several schools, which are discouraging their students from attending any such gathering tomorrow, and are warning against anyone planning to engage in disorderly behaviour.</p>
      <p>Our officers are continuing to monitor any communication in relation to this on social media.</p>
      <p>ENDS</p>
