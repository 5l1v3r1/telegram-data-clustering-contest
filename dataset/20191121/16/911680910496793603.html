      <p>The entire state of Arizona has become the latest market where Fry’s Food Stores' parent company Kroger Co. will offer online wine delivery to customers.</p>
      <p>Cincinnati-based Kroger, the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets, has partnered with Los Angeles-based <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_5f1258d2faf31489e5318e52688653b3">Drinks Holdings</a> to sell wine to be ordered online and delivered to Arizona customers’ homes or offices. The program is called “Kroger Wine.”</p>
      <p>“By leveraging our scalable platform, Kroger became the first grocery retailer of its kind to offer a ship-to-home wine program that brings the flexibility, convenience and personalization of e-commerce to the wine shopping experience,” said <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/search/results?q=Zac%20Brandenberg">Zac Brandenberg</a> , Drinks co-founder and CEO, in a statement.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2018/10/15/kroger-will-deliver-wine-to-customers-doors.html">Kroger Wine was launched in late 2018</a> and with the addition of Arizona, it is now available in 19 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
