      <p>Townsend has impressed at left-back after an injury to Kieran Gibbs and Nathan Ferguson's suspension.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has helped the Baggies in keeping clean sheets in the last two games and is aiming to clinch another one against Sheffield Wednesday at The Hawthorns on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen an improvement in my own performances this season. I feel a lot more confident," said Townsend, who was signed from Scunthorpe in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>“I came up from League One and it probably took me a little bit of time to adjust to the level, even though I wouldn’t have admitted that at the time.</p>
      <p>“I think confidence is the main difference I see in myself this season.</p>
      <p>"The confidence that the manager and coaching staff have given me is great and I hope that shows on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“They are putting on sessions that are spot on and I think you can see that in the way we are playing as a team. We play good football. We dominate possession and games and that suits me more as a player."</p>
      <p>With Ferguson serving another game on his ban, Townsend is set to start against Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“I do feel more confident stepping out on the pitch now which obviously helps my performance," he said.</p>
      <p>“I’d been watching from the side earlier in the campaign and the team have been playing brilliantly. They are a joy to watch.</p>
      <p>“I’ve just wanted to get involved, contribute and play a part. I feel like I’ve done that since I’ve been in the team. It’s been nice to play."</p>
      <p>Townsend added: “I think I have done alright. I still think there is more to come. I’m trying to keep working as hard as I can in training every day. Hopefully, I can stay in the team."</p>
