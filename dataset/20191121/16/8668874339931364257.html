      <h1>Du Plessis makes mid-season exit from Montpellier</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:52:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Former Springbok prop <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier/players/jannie-du-plessis/">Jannie du Plessis</a> has made a mid-season exit from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier">Montpellier</a> Herault in the Top 14.</p>
      <p>His time at the club was to come to an end in June 2019, but he extended his contract as a medical joker to cover the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> window for the side.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old appears to be heading back to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> with the blessing of his French employers.</p>
      <p>The club wished him well writing: “Another living legend bows out to us … He also delivered his last fight under the blue tunic Sunday. A huge thank you to Jannie Du Plessis who has worn our colors with honor for more than 4 seasons.”</p>

      <p>A qualified doctor, Du Plessis has been heavily linked to the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> back in his native South Africa.</p>
      <p>Capped 70 times for the Springboks, the older brother of Bismarck appears to be set for at least one final season of Super Rugby.</p>
      <p>Having moved to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> in 2015 following the Rugby World Cup, the tighthead has been a standout for the Vern Cotter coached outfit since his arrival.</p>
