Additionally, Currant uses artificial intelligence to identify energy usage patterns to help suggest changes to help you save on your energy bill.</p>

      <h3>How to find the best Black Friday deals on smart plugs for Alexa and Google Home</h3>
      <p>As far as smart home gadgets go, smart plugs are among the least-complicated. That said, there are a few factors to keep in mind that'll ensure you buy one that fits you and your lifestyle. For starters, the design of the smart plug you buy is very important. All of these plugs will go into any wall outlet in your home, but each one takes up a different amount of space. Some smart plugs are compact enough that you can plug two on top of each other, whereas others are a bit bulkier and take up the entire outlet space on your wall. You'll also find some smart plugs that take the shape of a power strip â€” allowing you to plug in a variety of things that can be controlled with your preferred virtual assistant. A lot of smart plugs also come with energy-monitoring tools, allowing you to easily see how much energy each plug is using so you can possibly get a cheaper utility bill each month. Lastly, seeing as most of the smart plugs on this list work with both Alexa and Google Assistant, you can control them with your voice whether you have Amazon Echo or Google Home speakers in your home.</p>
      <p>Smart plugs tend to have affordable prices all-year-round, but that just makes their potential Black Friday discounts all the more exciting. We aren't entirely sure what kind of deals will be offered for 2019, but we're bound to see savings of some kind. AUKEY and Eufy's smart plugs are among the most popular, meaning they're the most likely to get lower-prices for the shopping season. Companies like TP-Link, Currant, and others may also get in on the Black Friday action, too. It's sort of a game of wait-and-see right now, but we should learn more soon.</p>
      <p>Once the Black Friday deals begin rolling in, we'll get this guide updated to reflect the best prices that are currently available. After you find the perfect smart plug (or two), take a look at the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday-cyber-monday-2019">other Black Friday guides</a> here on Android Central.
