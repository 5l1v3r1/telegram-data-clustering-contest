      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:45:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author">John-Paul Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-paul-clark/</a></address>
      <p>Two primary schools have been rewarded for creating a positive environment for children who have experienced adversity.</p>
      <p>Our Lady of Lourdes in Blackburn and St John the Baptist in Fauldhouse are two of only four schools in Scotland who have been given the Attachment and Trauma Sensitive Schools Award (ATSSA), which provides a framework of support and understanding to schools so that children can heal, thrive, play, and learn.</p>
      <p>The children include those adopted from care, in the care of the local authority or who live with parents who cannot meet their needs.</p>
      <p>Our Lady Of Lourdes headteacher Eileen Brennan said: “We want our school to be a place where our children are in a state of learning readiness because they feel happy, loved, heard and understood.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“This award recognises the commitment from our staff to develop a culture of compassion and nurture, giving our pupils the very best opportunities to learn and succeed.”</p>
      <p>St John the Baptist headteacher Angela Gardner said: “We are pleased that the school has achieved this award.</p>
      <p>“Our main aim as a school is to allow each pupil to achieve their full potential. Part of this is making sure that every child feels nurtured and that their voice is heard in our school community.</p>
      <p>“This training allows us to reinforce our approach and we can take what we’ve learned moving forward.”</p>
      <p>The award aims to ensure that everyone within the educational environment has a good knowledge of the needs of children and young people who have experienced adversity and of the strategies and resources that are available to meet such needs.</p>
      <p>Jenny Nock from ATSSA said: “Our Lady of Lourdes registered with us in spring this year. At my first visit it was clear they already had a culture of deep compassion and nurture.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The award has provided a framework for them to operationalise supportive practices and resources and ensure consistency across the whole school.</p>
      <p>“They have been awarded the ATSSA at bronze level and we are delighted that they will now continue to silver level and beyond.</p>
      <p>“This will ensure best outcomes for pupils and families and I look forward to sharing this journey with them.”</p>
      <p>ATSSA launched in 2017 and there are currently 40 schools throughout the UK registered on the award.</p>
