      <h1>Israeli attorney general to announce decision on Netanyahu corruption charges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:37:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author">Yaron Steinbuch</a></address>
      <p>Israel’s attorney general will announce later Thursday whether he plans to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/28/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-faces-bribery-fraud-charges/">longstanding allegations of corruption</a>, according to the Justice Ministry.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit will announce his long-awaited decision to the public at 7:30 p.m. local time from the ministry’s headquarters in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>If, as it is widely expected, charges will be announced against Netanyahu, it would be the first time Israel is led by a premier facing a criminal indictment — and would deal a heavy blow to his hopes of remaining in office.</p>
      <p>If Netanyahu is cleared, it would give him a major boost as the country braces for the possibility of its third election in less than a year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Netanyahu has called activists from his Likud party and other supporters to the prime minister’s house an hour after the expected announcement, <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Mandelblit-reportedly-will-announce-Netanyahu-indictment-today-608541">according to the Jerusalem Post</a>.</p>
      <p>The embattled leader faces multiple graft allegations, including wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts — including cigars and champagne — from tycoons, offering to trade favors with a newspaper publisher and using his influence to help a wealthy telecom magnate in exchange for favorable coverage on a popular news site.</p>

      <p>Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in the three corruption cases, for which police recommended criminal charges in February, and claimed he is a victim of a political witch hunt as he lashed out at the media, prosecutors and the justice system.</p>
      <p>He could face up to 10 years behind bars if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>An indictment against Israel’s longest-serving leader would raise more uncertainty over who will ultimately lead a country mired in political chaos after two inconclusive elections this year.</p>
