      <p>Tamar Braxton has recently been bashed following some comments that she made about gays. Now, she has a thing or two to say about vegan people, but it’s best to read her original statement below.</p>
      <p>‘Ain’t no damn way I’m giving up meat for processed sodium-filled “vegan meat”….that’s PROCESSED to taste like my delicious cow 🐄😋!!! I’m tired of my vegan friends and MAN @david.adefeso looking at me crazy and think they are BETTER THAN ME cause I ate a steak,’ Tamar began her post.</p>
      <p>She continued and said: ‘🙄Well, do you know wtf you are eating??🤷🏽‍♀️ #pickyourpoison it’s all fcked up. Anyway, the birthday week fun begins my love❤️🌟*pulls up at Burger King for the REAL whopper Periodt*😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣’</p>
      <p>Someone said in the comments: ‘I do not eat anything that’s a fake fish or a fake chicken what the H is in that!! How you make all these weird products taste just like meat! Even the vegetables make us sick some times from poor farming… I give up. I’m waiting for my curry chicken delivery as I type.’</p>

      <p>A vegan also hopped in the comments and said: ‘I’m Vegan. I’m triggered. Lol 😂 but I love you Tamar.’</p>
      <p>One other follower posted this: ‘Listen, they’re recalling veggies all the time. Genetically modified crops, organic labeled veggies that aren’t really organic. It’s all the same. Eat that meat and be happy.’</p>
      <p>Another vegan person said that ‘My fam and friends been laughing and singing against me being vegan for 20 yrs now 😂 y’all wrong 😂.’</p>
      <p>It’s been recently reported that the singer just <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/tamar-braxton-apologizes-a-second-time-for-offensive-lgbt-comments-342280/">apologized for the second time</a> for some controversial comments that she made.</p>
      <p>Recently, Tamar stated that if a man doesn’t want to sleep with his woman for multiple days, it’s because he is gay. This triggered load and loads of shade.</p>
