      <p>Four men have been arrested from east Delhi for allegedly robbing passengers after hijacking a cab, police said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The accused, identified as Hashim (25), Satyabir Pandey (36), Sachin Paswan (22) and Majid Salmani (22), all residents of Ghaziabad, were arrested on Wednesday, they said.</p>
      <p>“On Wednesday, Sub-Inspector Arun Sindhu received a tip-off that the members of Hasim Gang would come to Anand Vihar ISBT, following which a trap was laid and the accused were arrested from near Hasanpur DTC Depot,” Ram Gopal Naik, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime), said.</p>
      <p>During interrogation, the accused disclosed that they had snatched a mobile phone from a person in the Loni area. On November 1, they booked a cab from Anand Vihar to Noida Sector-126 using the stolen device around 7:30 pm, the DCP said.</p>
      <p>Three accused persons posed as passengers and boarded the cab. After reaching Noida, they overpowered the driver, beat him up and looted his money and mobile phone, Naik said.</p>
      <p>They took the driver to a rented flat at Tila Village in Loni, Ghaziabad, where they drugged him and kept his phone on which he was receiving booking requests. Around midnight, a Pune-based businessman booked a cab from New Delhi Railway Station for IGI Airport, the police said.</p>
      <p>The trader had come to Delhi from Agra with his son and was headed to the airport to board a flight to Pune.</p>
      <p>One of the robbers drove the cab posing as its driver, while his three associates followed him in another car. They reached the railway station and picked the victims.</p>
      <p>The accused drove the car to a secluded spot and along with his associates, looted Rs 11,000, mobile phones and a laptop from the victims and took them at the flat in Tila Village, the police said.</p>
      <p>Later, the robbers withdrew Rs 1,60,000 with cards stolen from the victims and left the duo near Kashmiri Gate, they added.</p>
      <p>The driver of the cab was found lying unconscious in the car on Meerut Road, Ghaziabad, on November 2.</p>
      <p>Three country-made pistols, eight live cartridges, one cab, 24 tablets used for drugging the victims and five mobile phones were seized from their possession, the police added.</p>
