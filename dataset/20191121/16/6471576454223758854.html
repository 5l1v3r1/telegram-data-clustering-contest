      <p><a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2019-genesis-g90-limousine-debuts-in-south-korea-132538.html">G90</a> is the name of the flagship model, in production since 2015 at the Ulsan plant in South Korea. Known as the EQ900 until 2018, the luxobarge has gotten a lot better for the 2020 model year. Sales in the U.S. will start in December 2019, and two powerplants are available with either rear- or all-wheel drive; namely a V6 or a V8 blunderbuss.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúThe 2020 G90 builds on the level of engineering and craftsmanship that Genesis has come to represent in the United States,‚Äù</i> said chief executive officer Mark Del Rosso. The 3.3T Premium has 365 horsepower and 376 pound-feet of torque to offer, matching the engine in the Kia Stinger GT. What comes as a surprise, however, is that none of the entry-level engine choices in the A8, 7 Series, and S-Class can match the standard spec of the G90.</p>
      <p>Next up, the range-topping option is the 5.0 Ultimate with the Tau V8. A naturally aspirated plant with 420 horsepower and 383 pound-feet on tap, this engine doesn‚Äôt match the best Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz have to offer. On the other hand, Genesis isn‚Äôt trying to infuse any bit of sportiness into the G90 because that‚Äôs not the company‚Äôs thing.</p>
      <p>Both mills are connected to an eight-speed automatic transmission with a good ol‚Äô torque converter, and fuel economy ratings on the highway range from 15 to 25 miles to the gallon. The 124.4-inch wheelbase and 15.7-cu.ft. cargo volume are also appealing for a vehicle in this segment, but the strongest point of the Genesis is value for the money.</p>
      <p>From the get-go, the G90 comes with all the bells and whistles you‚Äôd ever want in a $70k luxury sedan. 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment, over-the-air software updates, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Intelligent Car Management Service, active noise cancellation, adaptive suspension with electronic dampers, basically the whole nine yards.</p>
      <p>Last, but certainly not least, take a look at the interior. That‚Äôs some high-quality finish right there, with real metal and wood detailing in addition to soft leather upholstery. On an ending note, does that shield-styled grille befit the mid-cycle refresh of the G90? üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>21 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>Today, Genesis introduced the 2020 G90 flagship luxury sedan at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show. The 2020 G90 incorporates new-car-level design changes on the exterior and interior, further enhancing its presence as the brand‚Äôs flagship sedan through the themes of Athletic Elegance and Horizontal Architecture.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúThe 2020 G90 is a flagship sedan for Genesis in the truest sense,‚Äù said William Lee, Executive Vice President and Global Head of the Genesis Brand. ‚ÄúIts launch begins a product offensive for the Genesis brand centered around emotive products with exceptional design.‚Äù</p>
        <p>Making its debut in the United States, the 2020 G90 formally introduces the next evolution of Genesis signature design language. The color palette is expanded inside and out for a more emotive look and feel, while G90 continues to provide an exemplary driving experience backed by superior quality.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúThe 2020 G90 builds on the level of engineering and craftsmanship that Genesis has come to represent in the United States,‚Äù said Mark Del Rosso, CEO of Genesis Motors North America.</p>
        <p>Evolution of Athletic Elegance</p>
        <p>With the exception of the roof and doors, every exterior body panel on the 2020 G90 has been replaced or changed.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúG90 is the ultimate expression of the Genesis brand,‚Äù said Luc Donckerwolke, Executive Vice President and Chief Design Officer of Hyundai Motor Group. ‚ÄúBefore the first sketch was even drawn, my team of designers thought carefully about how to evolve its styling and create something even more elegant and harmonic.‚Äù</p>
        <p>From front to back, the styling of the 2020 G90 evolves the Genesis brand‚Äôs Athletic Elegance design language. In front, the signature Crest Grille is flanked by Quad Lamps. In the rear, Quad Lamps wrap around from corner to corner. The license plate is placed as low as possible, further accentuating a low and wide stance. The elongated, horizontal side profile of G90 is characterized by vigor and dignity.</p>
        <p>G-Matrix, a Genesis design hallmark inspired by light reflecting from an illuminating diamond, is applied to the headlights and taillights to emphasize refined proportions and balanced architecture. For the first time, the G-Matrix pattern is applied to the optional, 19-inch wheels, which also feature sound absorption technology to noticeably reduce tire noise.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúWhen we tackled the challenge of reinventing G90, the Genesis flagship, we decided to start with designing light rather than form and shapes,‚Äù Donckerwolke said.</p>
        <p>The interior design embodies the ethos of Horizontal Architecture, dominated by a harmonious, flow of horizontal surfaces including a parallel layout that includes air ventilation system, and audio controls that maximize simplicity and provide an intuitive user experience. Immediately evident is a focus on premium materials and finishes that are befitting a flagship, including authentic chrome plating applied to switches and premium leather wrapping applied to the center console. Authentic, open-pore wood acts as a garnish, as does double stitching and piping throughout the cabin.</p>
        <p>Connectivity, Emotion, Serenity</p>
        <p>The 2020 G90 introduces multiple technology firsts for the Genesis brand, as befitting a flagship. It is the first Genesis vehicle to offer over-the-air wireless updates for maps and software. Its 12.3-inch display navigation system now incorporates touchscreen controls and a copper Graphic User Interface. The split screens are highlighted with signature copper accents.</p>
        <p>Further enhancing the technological capabilities of G90 are standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Mirror Link. Intelligent Car Management Service personalizes the driving experience by using data to analyze driving patterns and informs the driver of necessary maintenance and vehicle wear.</p>
        <p>The interior environment is more serene, thanks to Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which reduces noise, vibration and harshness using leading audio technology to reduce unwanted noise intrusion. Occupant convenience is enhanced by when entering tunnels through automatic external air prevention. The adaptive control suspension minimizes vibration in real time.</p>
        <p>The Genesis Adaptive Control Suspension with electronic damping control smoothly and precisely manages body motions throughout the range of dynamics with minimal compromises to ride comfort.</p>
        <p>Peace of Mind</p>
        <p>The 2020 G90, offers an unparalleled level of standard active and passive safety systems as part of a brand-level commitment to passenger security and comfort. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) in the 2020 G90 add a level of assuredness to the already refined driving experience. In addition to Genesis brandwide ADAS technology, the following new systems debut on the 2020 G90:</p>
        <p>Lane Following Assist (LFA) expands the reach of lane-keep and lane-departure assists, to help stay centered in a lane and provide steering assistance.</p>
        <p>Rear Cross-traffic Collision-Avoidance Assist (RCCA) uses rear side radar to help detect and prevent impact with obstacles.</p>
        <p>Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (FCA) can now help detect bicycles and vehicles in front of the vehicle.</p>
        <p>Safe Exit Assist (SEA) may alert a driver and passengers with alerts when an object is approaching an opening door.</p>
        <p>Highway Driving Assist (HDA) assists the driver to maintain the center of a lane on marked interstate highways, while keeping a safe distance from a vehicle in front. It can act in conjunction with Highway Auto Speed Slowdown, which adjusts vehicle speed to match posted signs.</p>
        <p>The 2020 G90 also includes 10 standard airbags, including a passenger-side knee airbag.</p>
        <p>Service Valet Comes Standard</p>
        <p>When the 2020 G90 goes on sale in the United States beginning in December 2019, it will arrive with the comprehensive Service Valet that already comes standard across the Genesis lineup. All Genesis vehicles offer the exclusive, no-cost, consumer-focused service program that elevates the luxury vehicle ownership experience.
