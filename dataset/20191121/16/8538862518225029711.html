      <p>Ghost Games has today released a fresh patch for <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/need_for_speed_heat">Need for Speed Heat</a> on PlayStation 4. Taking the game to version 1.03, this update makes some pretty decent improvements to the overall experience. You can download the patch right now -- it's just over 2GB in size.</p>
      <p>But what does it do? One thing it aims to address is long loading times during night races. The visual effects on night race intros have been reduced as a short term fix while Ghost Games figures out a better long term solution. Elsewhere, various scenarios which might crash the game have been addressed with this update, which is definitely appreciated.</p>
      <p>There are a few other bug fixes too, which you can read about on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/dz645u/need_for_speed_heat_update_14_update_notes/">Need for Speed subreddit</a>.
