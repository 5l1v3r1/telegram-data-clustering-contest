      <p>Real-time tactics meets rogue-like Bad North: Jotunn Edition is free on the Epic Game Store.</p>
      <p><b>Bad North: Jotunn Edition</b> is the latest free game offering through the Epic Games Store. It’s free until November 29.</p>
      <p>In it, you will do your best to defend your island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders. Position and relocate your troops to fend off enemies, and beware because they have their own counters. Also, if you lose a commander in battle they are gone forever. If you lose everything, it’s game over. Expect procedurally generated islands, and unlockable upgrades to use on your troops.</p>

      <p>Next week it will be replaced by Rayman Legends. In the platformer-action game, you will run through over 100 maps and can connect with friends through a variety of challenges and have a look at leaderboards to see where you rank.</p>
      <p>Last week’s free game was The Messenger.</p>
