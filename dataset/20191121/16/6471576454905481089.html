      <p>The rather short time between the concept's reveal and the launch of the production model is made possible by the advent of <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/porsche-taycan-cross-turismo-shows-up-in-vr-after-testing-on-virtual-nurburgring-130656.html">VR technologies at Porsche</a>, whose engineers can test a large number of systems and components in a virtual environment.</p>
      <p>In fact, virtual prototypes of the Taycan Cross Turismo had already completed 10 million digital kilometers by this time last year, so the real pre-production models have been rarely seen in the wild. The prototype caught by our spies in <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/porsche/">Porsche</a>'s own car park, near the Technical Center in Zuffenhausen, and it looks it might have shed a bit more camouflage than the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/porsche-taycan-cross-turismo-shows-up-on-nurburgring-730-lap-time-rumored-133354.html">last time we saw it</a>.</p>
      <p>Porsche's second electric-only vehicle after the regular Taycan, the crossover is set to steal a slice of the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/tesla-motors/model-x/">Tesla Model X</a> market, even though it will be quite a bit more expensive and won't offer a 7-seat version.</p>
      <p>That said, just like Model X, the Taycan Cross Turismo is an all-electric luxury crossover with all-wheel-drive and slightly higher ground clearance, so it's bound to be cross-shopped.</p>
      <p>Identical under the hood with the regular Taycan, it's expected that the car will also have a similar performance despite a slight increase in weight.</p>
      <p>We are talking about a lithium-ion battery that's based on the 800-volt architecture, permanent magnet synchronous electric motors and at least three versions: a Taycan Cross Turismo 4S as the entry-level, followed by a Turbo and a Turbo S version, with up to 761 horsepower.</p>
      <p>Unlike the Mission E Cross Turismo Concept, which was a four-seater, the Taycan Cross Turismo should be offered with either a 2+2 or a 5-seat arrangement, similar to the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/i.html#ge-internal-combustion-engine"><u>ICE</u></a>-powered Panamera Sport Turismo. üèÅ</p>
