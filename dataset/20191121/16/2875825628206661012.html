      <p>Gardai are holding the truck in which 16 people were found on a ferry today.</p>
      <p>It has also emerged that the captain of the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/stena-line-ab">Stena Line</a> ship informed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/an-garda-siochana">gardai</a> of the discovery at 9.45am this morning.</p>
      <p>Some 16 people were found in a sealed trailer on board the ferry, which left Cherbourg in France at 9pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/an-garda-siochana">Gardai</a> and emergency services met the ferry at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rosslare">Rosslare</a> Europort in Co <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wexford">Wexford</a> this afternoon as it docked at 2.40pm.</p>
      <p>The people were discovered in a sealed trailer of a lorry during a routine inspection.</p>
      <p>They are said to be "in good health" and are receiving medical assistance and assessments.</p>
      <p>Gardai will soon carry out an assessment on their <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/immigration">immigration</a> status.</p>
      <p>The driver and owners of the truck are now assisting gardai with their probe into the find.</p>
      <p>A Garda statement this afternoon read: "An Garda Siochana at Wexford Garda Station are currently investigating potential breaches of Immigration Legislation which may have occurred on board a Stena Line Ferry travelling from Cherbourg, which arrived in Rosslare today at approximately 2.40pm.</p>
      <p>"At approximately 09.45am today 21 November 2019 the Captain of the Ferry alerted Gardai that a number of people had been discovered in the trailer of an articulated tractor unit on the vehicle deck.</p>
      <p>"All the individuals appear in good health and are currently receiving medical assessments on arrival at Rosslare Port.

      <p>"An Garda Siochana are now investigating all the circumstances of this incident.</p>
      <p>"The Articulated Truck involved in this incident has been detained.</p>
      <p>"The driver and the owners of the articulated vehicle are assisting An Garda Siochana with our enquiries.</p>
      <p>"An Garda Siochana is making no further comment at this time.</p>

      <p>In a statement earlier, Ian Hampton, Stena Line's chief people and communications officer, said an employee discovered the people during a routine inspection.</p>
      <p>He said: "During the Stena Horizon's 9pm sailing from Cherbourg, France, to Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday November 20, one of our employees during a routine inspection discovered 16 people in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck.</p>
      <p>"All the individuals are reported to be in good health and have been moved to a private passenger lounge on the ship where their wellbeing is the focus of our employees.</p>
      <p>"Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel's arrival in Rosslare.</p>
      <p>"The vessel is scheduled to arrive at approximately 3.30pm today."</p>
