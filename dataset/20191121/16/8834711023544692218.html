      <p>African National Congress (ANC) MP Bongani Bongo, who was arrested on corruption charges on Thursday, is set to face Parliament’s ethics committee.</p>
      <p>The former state security minister was arrested by the Hawks before he appeared in the Cape Town Magistrates Court. He was released on R5,000 bail.</p>
      <p>ANC chief whip Pemmy Majodina said Parliament’s ethics committee was only inducted two weeks ago but would be seized with the Bongo matter at the soonest possible time.</p>
      <p>Bongo currently served as the chairperson of the National Assembly’s home affairs portfolio committee.</p>
      <p>“There is a case that Mr Bongo is facing with the ethics committee. Mr Bongo was phoned by the committee to come and appear before it,” Majodina said.</p>
      <p>Majodina said the ANC’s Luthuli House would also have to reconsider Bongo’s deployment.</p>
      <p>“The ANC makes deployments on their members, but now that we have such a case. Maybe the ANC needs to reconsider the deployment,” she said.</p>
