      <p>Premier John Horgan is urging all sides in Metro Vancouver's transit dispute to resume bargaining and negotiate a new contract over the next few days before union threats of a complete system shut down come true.</p>
      <p>His advice comes as another transit union representing 900 SkyTrain workers announced a 96.8 per cent vote in favour of job action if a contract isn't reached.</p>
      <p>Horgan says he won't take measures to step into the transit operators dispute, noting both sides have this weekend to reach a settlement before Wednesday's deadline that would shut down bus and SeaBus service across Metro Vancouver.</p>
      <p>Unifor, the union that represents the 5,000 workers, says unless it reaches a settlement with TransLink's Coast Mountain Bus Company in the coming days, it will stage the three-day walk out.</p>
      <p>Coast Mountain says in a statement more than 350,000 people take the bus daily in Metro Vancouver and they should not be caught in the middle of this dispute.</p>
      <p>Michel Ladrak, the president of BC Rapid Transit Company, which oversees SkyTrain workers, says eight sessions of mediated talks are planned over the next month and the union hasn't given any indication that it will serve strike notice.</p>
