      <h1>David Eason Says He’s ‘Much Happier’ Without Jenelle Evans – Admits He ‘Never Loved’ Her!</h1>

      <p>David Eason took to social media to tell the world that, ever since his split from Jenelle Evans, he and his older daughter have been doing great! Not only that but he also admitted that he never loved the former Teen Mom star!</p>
      <p>As fans know, Jenelle finally decided to put an end to her tumultuous marriage with David Eason last month!</p>
      <p>That being said, the man now claims he is ‘much happier’ without her in his life in a post on his Facebook page.</p>
      <p>It’s safe to say that the controversial man held nothing back when it came to throwing some shade at his estranged wife.</p>
      <p>Seemingly in response to people thinking he was really negatively impacted by the separation, David wrote: ‘Glad u people think I am taking this so hard. Just so u all know I’m so very much happier and so is [daughter] Maryssa. Finally peaceful!’</p>
      <p>But despite this statement, there were still fans in that very post’s comment section who thought he was taking it hard.</p>
      <p>Replying to one such comment, David once again insisted that he was doing great without Jenelle who he never loved, apparently: ‘I’m not heartbroken. I realized I wasn’t in love and there are much better people out there for me.’</p>
      <p>Jenelle and David were married for over two years but their time together was not without drama and scandals.</p>
      <p>Days after it was announced that they were over, Jenelle proceeded to get a temporary restraining order against David, claiming she feared for her and her kids’ lives.</p>
      <p>What that means is that he is not legally allowed to see or even contact Jenelle or their 2 year old daughter, Ensley.</p>
      <p>The same applies to Jenelle’s two sons from other relationships – 10 year old Jace and 5 year old Kaiser.</p>
