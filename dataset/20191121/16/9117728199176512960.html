        <b>Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto admits the Italian squad are still trailing behind their rivals when it comes to race pace, claiming that they focussed more on cornering speed than straight-line speed at the Brazilian Grand Prix. They were on for a good finish at Interlagos before contact between drivers <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> ended both of their races.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ferrari's strength this season has been their speed on the straights, with Leclerc taking his victories in Belgium and Italy due to his incredible pace in a straight line.</p>

      <p>However, the pace wasn't so evident in Sao Paulo, and Binotto says this is a conscious choice on Ferrari's behalf.</p>
      <p>He told Autosport: <i>“We are still lacking a bit of pace in the race – not much, but certainly what’s required to make sure that we stay ahead.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Sebastian was a comfortable third, he was faster than at least a Mercedes and another Red Bull.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Charles from 14th would have been on the podium eventually, so I think the race certainly was OK.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It is the very first time maybe where we are so close to them in grip limited, showing that as Ferrari we are moving in a different set-up direction, giving advantage in the cornering.”</i>
