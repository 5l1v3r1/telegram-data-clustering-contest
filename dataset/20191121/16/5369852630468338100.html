      <p>THIS SATURDAY’S PREMIER League meeting between Brighton and Leicester City will come too soon for Ireland international Aaron Connolly. </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old forward, who hit the headlines with two fine goals in a win over Tottenham last month, <a href="https://www.the42.ie/aaron-connolly-4-4886475-Nov2019/">picked up a groin injury that forced him off at half-time against Manchester United 11 days ago</a>. </p>
      <p>That problem saw Galway native Connolly miss Ireland’s international matches against New Zealand and Denmark, having made his senior debut for the Boys in Green in October. </p>
      <p>While he will play no part against the high-flying Foxes at the Amex Stadium, Seagulls boss Graham Potter is hopeful of having the teenager available for the trip to Anfield to face the league leaders Liverpool next weekend.</p>
      <p>“Leandro Trossard rolled his ankle while he was away – it was more precautionary that he was left out of the Belgian squad,” Potter said during his squad update today. </p>
      <p>“He’s trained with us and he’s fine for the weekend. Shane Duffy and Davy Propper are also back fine. Steven Alzate got back late last night, but he’s okay too.</p>
      <blockquote>Aaron Connolly will miss the game this weekend with the same groin problem from the Manchester United game, but hopefully he’ll be back for next weekend.</blockquote>
      <p>“Bernardo has been back in training this week, but the weekend is too soon for him.</p>
      <p>“Adam Webster has a chance of being fit for the weekend and it’s a lot earlier than expected. He’s trained today [Thursday] and we’ll see how he is tomorrow [Friday]. We have good options in that area of the field.”</p>
