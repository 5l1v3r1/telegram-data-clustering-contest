        <b>It appears the season of shade throwing amongst celebrities is upon us and currently trending online, is the brewing <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1219307-4-types-drama-literature.html">drama</a> between singer Davido's baby mamas, Sophia Momodu and Amanda.</b>
      </p>
      <p>For a while, it appeared there was a peaceful relationship with Davido's first baby mama, Sophia and his US-based second baby mama, Amanda. However, recent events have shown that all may not be well between the two ladies.</p>
      <p>Just recently, Sophie took to her Snapchat to debunk speculations about her undergoing the knife for a plastic surgery. However, Amanda wasn't buying it as she took to her social media page to share a subliminal message about women with work done on their body, denying it.</p>
      <p>Sophia however, was not having it as she in turn, took to her page to throw shade. She accused women of being their own biggest haters, warning who most people assume was Amanda, not to get on her bad side.</p>
