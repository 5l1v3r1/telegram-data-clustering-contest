      <h1>Best And Worst Q4 2019: Utilities ETFs And Mutual Funds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:34:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">David Trainer</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Utilities sector ranks eleventh in Q4'19.</li>
        <li>Based on an aggregation of ratings of the 68 stocks in the Utilities sector.</li>
        <li>FXU is our top-rated Utilities ETF and BULIX is our top-rated Utilities mutual fund.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Utilities sector ranks eleventh out of the 11 sectors as detailed in our <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4301154-q4-2019-sector-ratings-etfs-mutual-funds">Q4'19 Sector Ratings for ETFs and Mutual Funds</a> report. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4289564-best-worst-q3-2019-utilities-etfs-mutual-funds">Last quarter</a>, the Utilities sector ranked tenth. It gets our Very Unattractive rating, which is based on an aggregation of ratings of the 68 stocks in the Utilities sector. See a recap of our <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/5347800-q319-sector-ratings-recap">Q3'19 Sector Ratings here</a>.</p>
      <p>Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the sector. Not all Utilities sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same. The number of holdings varies widely (from 23 to 223). This variation creates drastically different investment implications and, therefore, ratings.</p>
      <p>Investors should not buy any Utilities ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive-or-better rating. If you must have exposure to this sector, you should buy a basket of Attractive-or-better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees. Active management has a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1233581-less-than-1-percent-of-managers-deliver-alpha-here-are-details">long history</a> of not paying off.</p>
      <p>Our <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/4942325-transparency-can-trust-research">Robo-Analyst technology</a><a href="https://www.newconstructs.com/utilities-sector-4Q19-best-and-worst/#_ftn1">[1]</a> empowers our unique <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/863691-predictive-rating-methodology-for-etfs-and-mutual-funds">ETF and mutual fund rating methodology</a>, which leverages our rigorous analysis of each fund’s holdings.<a href="https://www.newconstructs.com/utilities-sector-4Q19-best-and-worst/#_ftn2">[2]</a> We think advisors and investors focused on prudent investment decisions should include analysis of fund holdings in their research process for ETFs and mutual funds.</p>

          <b>The Danger Within</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Buying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. Put another way, research on fund holdings is necessary due diligence because a fund’s performance is only as good as its holdings’ performance. Don’t just take our word for it, see what Barron’s says on this matter.</p>
      <p>PERFORMANCE OF HOLDINGs = PERFORMANCE OF FUND</p>
      <p>Analyzing each holding within funds is no small task. Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform this diligence with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill the fiduciary duty of care. More of the biggest names in the financial industry (see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/business/dealbook/blackrock-actively-managed-funds-computer-models.html">At BlackRock, Machines Are Rising Over Managers to Pick Stocks</a>) are now embracing technology to leverage machines in the investment research process. Technology may be the only solution to the dual mandate for research: cut costs and fulfill the fiduciary duty of care. Investors, clients, advisors and analysts deserve the latest in technology to get the diligence required to make prudent investment decisions.</p>
