      <h1>Eminem Mimicked Comedian Chris D’Elia’s Impression Of Him When They Met</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:44:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Fu</a></address>
      <p>In September 2018, comedian <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Chris-delia">Chris D'Elia</a> went viral for <a href="https://genius.com/Chris-delia-eminem-parody-lyrics">his parody</a> of <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Eminem">Eminem</a> rapping. He caught the Detroit MC’s attention earlier this year <a href="https://genius.com/a/eminem-praises-comedian-chris-d-elia-s-impersonation-of-his-rapping">with another impersonation</a>, which led to a recent meeting between the two celebrities. On a recent episode of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjbOqXEP1OU"><i>Congratulations</i> podcast</a>, D'Elia reminisced about visiting Em in the studio and recalled how the rapper gave him the ultimate compliment by mimicking the comedian’s impression.</p>
      <p>“We show up and Eminem’s just sitting there like, ‘Come on in,’” D'Elia remembered. “Eminem stands up and goes like this, ‘Flappin’ around like a bapkin'‘ to me, and I’m like, 'Okay, this is the fucking craziest thing to me already.’ He’s doing my impression [of him] to me.”</p>

      <p>On D'Elia’s first Eminem parody, he closes it out by rapping:</p>
      <blockquote>You using way too many napkins<br/>Bapkins<br/>Lapkins and Chapki-<br/>You using ChapStick and napkins while I’m bapkin'<br/>Flappin' around like a bapkin'</blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Logic">Logic</a> later sampled the viral video on the outro of his Eminem collaboration, <a href="https://genius.com/Logic-homicide-lyrics">“Homicide,”</a> which was released earlier this year as the third single from the Maryland rapper’s album, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Logic/Confessions-of-a-dangerous-mind"><i>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</i></a>.</p>
      <p>In the song’s music video, D'Elia stands in for Eminem:</p>

      <p>While D'Elia and Eminem were hanging out, the rapper admitted there was truth to the comedian’s more recent impersonation. “We’re all talking and he was like, ‘Man, you killed that impression, it was so funny. And the one in the garage when you’re out of breath. Dude, that’s hilarious because I get out of breath sometimes,’” D'Elia said.</p>
      <p>Em was referencing D'Elia’s January 2019 parody, which draws inspiration from <a href="https://genius.com/Eminem-kick-off-freestyle-lyrics">“Kick Off,”</a> an 11-minute freestyle Eminem released in December 2018 to accompany the release of <i>Bodied</i>, the battle rap film he helped produce.</p>

      <p>Later on in the podcast, D'Elia said Em was “the most normal, cool guy” and revealed they bonded over their love of hip-hop and comedy.</p>
      <p>“He was just a real mature cool dude. Talked a lot about hip-hop,” the comedian recalled. “We talked about comedy a lot. We talked about different comedians. We talked about my act, what I’m talking about.”</p>
