      <p>A North Carolina mom is facing criminal charges stemming from the death of her 3-year-old son, who fell from an escalator and died, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Jiterria Lightner will turn herself in this week to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police after warrants were issued to charge her with child abuse and neglect, <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/investigations/investigators/mother-charged-with-neglect-after-3-year-olds-deadly-fall-from-escalator/275-07770c67-70a7-48c5-98a1-5a3e7c759f1d">news station WCNC reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Lightner was traveling with her son, Jaiden Cowart, and two other children when he fell in late September from the top of the escalator at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, police said. The boy was hospitalized and died three days later from blunt force injuries.</p>
      <p>Police initially determined his death an accident, but said their homicide unit was now looking at the case, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/3-year-old-died-after-fall-airport-escalator-now-his-n1086751">NBC News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“She’s a single mother that was watching three children at an airport, and I think the circumstances could have happened to a number of us,” Lightner’s attorney Michael Greene told WCNC. “I don’t think they rise to the level of a crime.”</p>
      <p>If convicted, the grieving mom could face up to 150 days in jail, the outlet reported.</p>
