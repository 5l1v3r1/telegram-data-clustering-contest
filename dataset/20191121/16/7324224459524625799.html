      <p>The Conservative Party election campaign coach was temporarily left stranded on a housing estate after a technical fault rendered it unsafe to drive.</p>
      <p>Journalists and Tory staffers were stuck at the new development in Bedford on the “Get Brexit Done” bus for around 45 minutes because of a fault with the electric wing mirror.</p>
      <p>The driver eventually fixed the problem on the Mercedes-Benz Tourismo coach, which was unveiled by the Prime Minister at an event last week.</p>

      <p>Boris Johnson was not on board at the time, having travelled by train to the housing development in Wixams, Bedford, earlier on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The coach is used to transport travelling journalists, Conservative Party staff and occasionally the Prime Minister and his inner circle on the General Election campaign trail.</p>
      <p>It comes after criticism over the Daily Mirror’s exclusion from the coach during visits on Wednesday when several other newspapers were invited to join the battle bus.</p>
