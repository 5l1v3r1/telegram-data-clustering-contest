      <p>Popular Ghanaian fetish priest Nana Kwaku Bonsam has appealed to the government to make him the President of the National Shrine.</p>
      <p>According to the fetish priest, since there is freedom of worship in Ghana there should obviously be a National shrine.</p>
      <p>He added that since the government has proposed the idea of building a national shrine, he is the right person to fit the position as the president.</p>
      <p>Kwaku Bonsam also added that he is a very decent person who is not fraudulent and always abides by the laws of the country.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“If the government has proposed the idea of building a national shrine them I am the right person to serve as the president.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Such an office needs a person who is decent, has the needs of the people at heart, abides by the rules of the country and also not a fraudulent person and I know I am the right person.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>I am appealing with the government to take this plan into action and make me the president”,</i> Kwaku Bonsam stated.</p>
      <p>This comes after the Minister of Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi disclosed that the government is considering to build a national shrine after the national cathedral.</p>
      <p><i>“I think that since the constitution allows freedom of worship, we will study it very well and see how possible that will also be. We are not ruling out traditional shrines”,</i> the Minister disclosed.</p>
