      <h2>Prime minister calls indictment for bribery, fraud and breach of trust ‘attempted coup’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:40:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author">Ilan Ben Zion, Mehul Srivastava</a></address>
      <p>Benjamin Netanyahu is to be charged with corruption by Israeli prosecutors in a move that threatens to end the prime minister’s career and deepen the country’s political woes. </p>
      <p>The charges follow three probes into Mr Netanyahu’s relationships with wealthy friends and regulatory favours he allegedly promised to media barons to secure favourable coverage for him and his wife.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Avichai Mandelblit, attorney-general, said Mr Netanyahu would be charged with one count of bribery and three counts of fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>“A day in which the attorney-general decides to indict a sitting prime minister for serious crimes of corrupt governance is a heavy and sad day for Israel,” said Mr Mandelblit.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu attacked the attorney-general for “custom tailoring” a suit to trap him and demanded that “the investigators be investigated”.</p>
      <p>In a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Netanyahu, 70, added: “We are witnesses to an attempted coup against the prime minister with false accusations, and a tainted and skewed investigation. What I am going through is not easy — I am also a human being. My blood, and my wife’s blood and my son’s blood is being spilled.”</p>
      <p>The prime minister has always denied the charges and the prospect of his removal from power and possible jailing has energised his rightwing base.</p>
      <p>The indictments come as Israel lurches into a full-blown political crisis. Reuven Rivlin, the president, told the Israeli parliament on Thursday that it had three weeks to choose a candidate to cobble together a governing majority of 61 seats or face a third election in 11 months.</p>
      <p>Both Mr Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, his main challenger, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/372997ca-0b82-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">have already tried and failed </a>to form majorities after deadlocked elections in April and September.</p>
      <p>Without a majority, Mr Netanyahu is serving as interim prime minister and has repeatedly vowed not to resign even if indicted. There is a legal precedent for a minister to resign if under indictment, but this has never been tested in a case that involves a serving prime minister.</p>

      <p>Amir Fuchs, a legal expert with the Israel Democracy Institute, said: “If the PM resigns, the whole government collapses, and you cannot reinstate him as a prime minister if he is acquitted.” The Supreme Court would probably have to weigh in, he added.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu also face a possible challenge from within Likud, the party that he has led to four premierships, with education minister Gideon Sa’ar calling for party primaries to replace him. </p>
      <p>A close ally of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/64062f06-0a42-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">Donald Trump</a>, Mr Netanyahu is Israel’s longest-serving prime minister and has dominated the nation’s politics since the 1990s, when he rode to power on his staunch opposition to the Oslo Peace Accords.</p>
      <p>In the past decade, he introduced free-market reforms and pulled the country to the right, forging alliances with the ultraorthodox religious minority and herding settlers and anti-Arab hardliners into what he described as the strongest rightwing government in Israel’s history.</p>
      <p>The charges against Mr Netanyahu stem from 16 months of investigations by Israeli police into the prime minister’s relationships. Probes code-named Cases 1000, 2000 and 4000 have documented Mr Netanyahu and his wife Sara’s taste for pink Dom Pérignon champagne and Cuban Partagas cigars, while leaks to Israeli media included tape recordings that embarrassed and then enraged the prime minister. Some members of his inner circle were charged ahead of Mr Netanyahu’s indictment.</p>

      <p>In Case 1000, authorities looked into hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts given to Mr Netanyahu and his wife by wealthy businessmen, including Arnon Milchan, an Israeli-born producer of Hollywood blockbusters such as <i>Pretty Woman </i>and <i>12 Years a Slave</i>. </p>
      <p>The gifts from Mr Milchan and Australian casino billionaire James Packer “turned into a sort of supply line”, the attorney-general’s office said, amounting to about $200,000 over the years, and “significantly damaged public trust and integrity”.</p>
      <p>In exchange for the alleged bribes, Mr Netanyahu did various favours, including using his office to lobby for a 10-year US visa for Mr Milchan and for a change in tax laws for his benefit, the attorney-general found. </p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu denies the latter allegation, arguing that it was normal for the prime minister to help a prominent Israeli resolve his problems with the US. </p>
      <p>In Case 2000, the attorney-general charged Mr Netanyahu with fraud and breach of trust for offering a deal to a media baron to gain favourable media coverage.</p>
      <p>Under the alleged arrangement, Mr Netanyahu made an offer to the publisher of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper: if the publication diluted its criticism of the government, the prime minister would help curtail the circulation of a rival free daily owned by Sheldon Adelson, a US casino magnate. That resulted in a “significant financial benefit” for Yedioth’s owner. The prime minister denies the allegation.</p>
      <p>The most serious charge stems from an investigation into whether Mr Netanyahu used two trusted intermediaries to influence coverage at a news website owned by Bezeq, the country’s largest telecom provider. </p>
      <p>Both intermediaries have turned state’s witness, and that investigation also resulted in the indictment of Shaul Elovitch, one of Israel’s richest men and the then-chief executive of Bezeq. </p>
      <p>Mr Elovitch pressured editors at Walla, the news portal, to change articles to reflect Mr Netanyahu’s demands, the attorney-general found.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu is also to be charged with fraud and breach of trust in this case, which he denies. Police have accused Mr Elovitch of paying bribes. He also denies the accusations.</p>
