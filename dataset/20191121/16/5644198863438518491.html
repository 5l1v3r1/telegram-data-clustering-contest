      <p>BEIJING: China resolutely opposes US lawmakers' <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-rights-bill-clears-us-congress-heads-to-trump-12112894">passing of a Hong Kong human rights Bill</a> and will never allow anyone to destroy Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said on Thursday (Nov 21).</p>
      <p>The Bill "indulges violent criminals" and aims to "muddle or even destroy Hong Kong", Wang said.</p>

      <p>China's foreign ministry said in a statement that Wang, China's state councillor, told former US Secretary of Defense William Cohen during a meeting in Beijing that China will never allow anyone to undermine its "one country two systems" principle. He added that the legislation was a "naked interference in China's internal affairs".</p>
      <p>"If the US side is determined to act alone, China will take effective measures to resolutely fight back," foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing, without giving more details about what action Beijing might take.</p>

      <p>The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act passed the House of Representatives by 417 to 1 on Wednesday, one day after the Senate unanimously passed the measure.</p>
      <p>The Bill requires the US president to annually review the favourable trade status that Washington grants to Hong Kong, and threatens to revoke it if the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's freedoms are quashed.</p>
      <p>The White House has not threatened to veto the measure and President Donald Trump is expected to sign it, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"ERRONEOUS</b>
        <b> SIGNAL"</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Hong Kong government expressed strong opposition to the passage of the Bill through the Senate and House of Representative. </p>
      <p>It said in a statement that the Bill would "interfere in the internal affairs of Hong Kong" and sends "an erroneous signal to the violent protesters, which would not be conducive to de-escalating the situation in Hong Kong".</p>
