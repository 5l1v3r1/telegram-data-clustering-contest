      <p>A cruel New York dog owner is facing criminal charges after his starving pooch apparently chewed off her own leg while in a crate chained to the yard.</p>
      <p>Carl Pritchard, 59, was charged Monday with cruelty and failure to provide food and shelter after a UPS worker spotted the suffering German shepherd named Zoe at the Exeter home, state troopers said.</p>
      <p>Police said the UPS driver reported seeing the dog on Nov. 14 with what appeared to be her leg blown off.</p>
      <p>Zoe — who is about nine years old — was living outside in a plastic pet carrier and had no food, as well as a dog bowl covered in snow, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The pooch was brought to the Oneonta Veterinary Clinic, which determined that she had chewed off her front leg.</p>
      <p>“The dog was very emaciated,” Dr. Joan Puritz said. “She may not have been getting enough nutrition. The leg was probably injured and she was trying to take care of it herself.”</p>
      <p>Zoe was then transferred to Cornell University veterinary school for further treatment, the vet said.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Puritz said. “It breaks your heart. She’s such a sweet dog.”</p>
