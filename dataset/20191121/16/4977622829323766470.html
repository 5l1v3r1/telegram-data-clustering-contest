      <p>The written reply by Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh to a question in the Rajya Sabha has revealed that close to seven lakh positions in central government department were lying vacant as of 1 March 2018, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nearly-seven-lakh-vacant-posts-in-central-government-departments-ministry/articleshow/72161624.cms">reports </a><i>The Times of India.</i></p>
      <p>Out of this total number, 5,74,289 of said vacant positions fell in to the Group C category, while 89,638 were Group B jobs, and finally, 19,896 vacancies in the Group A Category.</p>
      <p>Singh stated that one of the steps to taken to fill up vacancies has been to shorten the recruitment cycle by way of shifting to computer-based online tests, and my getting rid of interviews for non-gazetted positions.</p>
      <p>A specific matter of concern has been the large number of backlog vacancies for reserved categories, i.e. Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes (OBCs) in various government departments.</p>
      <p>The minister revealed that a large number of the backlog vacancies had been filled up by the end of 2018 itself.</p>
