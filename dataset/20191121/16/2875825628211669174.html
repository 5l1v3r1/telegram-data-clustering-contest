      <h2>The Cork punter won the massive sum from two bets amounting to a stake of just €25</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:41:58+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/gavin-quinn/" target="_blank">Gavin Quinn</a></address>
      <p>One Cork punter is over €17,000 richer after placing four bets on UK horse racing yesterday - with a total stake of a mere €65.</p>
      <p>Dropping into a local Boylesports bookmakers in the Rebel county, the lucky player put €3 on a four-fold bet on five horses as well as a €5 accumulator on those same horses in action at Hexham, Warwick and Chepstow to get the ball rolling.</p>
      <p>The first winner came at Warwick in the 1.35 race as Winter Getaway obliged at 9/2. The remaining four winners were Good And Hardy (3/1) and Lock’s Corner (2/1) at Chepstow, Flinck (11/4) at Warwick and Casimir Du Clos (6/1) at Hexham.</p>
      <p>The €3 four-fold bet brought in €6,105.38 while the €5 each way accumulator resulted in a handsome €8,755.08.</p>
      <p>The customer won another €422.25 from a €20 double and €1,874.00 from a €20 treble - seeing the punter take home a jaw-dropping sum totalling €17,166.71 from a stake of €65 on the four bets.</p>
      <p>Sarah Kinsella, spokesperson for BoyleSports said: “Congratulations to our Cork customer who turned €25 into a tremendous amount of €17,166.71!</p>
      <p>"Their ambition deserves all the rewards and we hope they have a good time spending their winnings during the festive period”.</p>
