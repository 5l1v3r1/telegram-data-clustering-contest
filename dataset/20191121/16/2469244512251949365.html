      <p>Tiverton High School has reaffirmed plans for a new school are moving ahead after a video was posted by the town's Labour Party candidate.</p>
      <p>A post put on Facebook by Labour Party candidate Liz Pole and Labour town councillor Steve Bush on November 9, addresses the Building Schools for the Future funding, announced by the Labour Government and abolished under the Conservative and Lib Dem coalition following that year’s election.</p>
      <p>In the video, Councillor Steve Bush says: “Tiverton High School was built in the 1960s. It’s quite an old building, it’s quite dilapidated and needs a lot of upkeep and maintenance.</p>
      <p>“The Labour Party, when it was in Government in 2010, had it in their new schools’ building programme and were going to build a new high school here on this site.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately one of the first acts of the Tory Coalition Government in 2010 was to cut the funding for the new schools building programme and that included Tiverton High School. We lost the new high school, thanks to the coalition government.”</p>
      <p>Tiverton High School say they have been working on the relocation of the school since 2009, driven principally by the need for increased school places as the population grows.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the school said: “A master plan was created and funded by Devon County Council for submission to the local planning authority. Outline planning permission to build a new school for 1800 students on the TCLP-owned field to the east of Bolham Road was granted in 2017.</p>
      <p>“The development will be part-funded by TCAT who will build a community theatre adjacent to the school. The next stage of development will be the preparation of detailed plans and works to comply with the reserved matters outlined in the grant of outline planning permission.</p>
      <p>“This is a large amount of work and discussions are currently taking place between the stakeholders in this project to agree on funding for these preliminary works. A significant proportion of this money is already secured. Once this stage is complete, the project will be in a strong position to bid for capital funds as they become available.</p>
      <p>“The school condition report completed by the DfE has been published recently, and Devon County Council are in discussion with the DfE to ensure that THS is in the best position to secure capital funding. THS enjoys the support of Mid Devon District Council, Devon County Council and representatives of all local political parties.</p>
      <p>“Despite challenges, THS continues to provide a safe and inspiring physical environment for all young learners in our community.” </p>
