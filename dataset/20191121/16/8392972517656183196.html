      <p>Speaking on the RuPaul: What's the Tee? podcast, Cheryl said: "I like to meditate, I actually use an app called Insight Timer. I really love it.</p>
      <p>"And recently the updated version has a kids section so it reads stories to my little boy, he's two. I put it on for bed, sometimes the woman tells him to breathe in and breathe out and he goes, 'ahhh', it's super cute. So I've already got him onto that."</p>
      <p>The star, who shares Bear with ex-boyfriend Liam Payne, also revealed she wants Bear to grow up and rescue turtles in Barbados rather than go into the showbiz industry.</p>
      <p>She added: "We don't check in enough. Intuition. I'm preparing him. I hope he becomes an earth boy rescuing turtles in Barbados.</p>

      <p>"And I think I built fatherhood up so much in my head that it kind of messed me up to start with. I started in a bad place with it.</p>
      <p>"[Cheryl] is one of the most, if not the most, important people in my life. I'm lucky I have someone who understands what I'm going through."</p>
