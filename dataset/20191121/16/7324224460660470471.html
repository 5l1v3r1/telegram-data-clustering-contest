      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been charged in a series of corruption cases, throwing the country’s paralysed political system into further disarray and threatening the long-time leader’s grip on power.</p>
      <p>Capping a three-year investigation, attorney general Avichai Mandelblit charged Mr Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three different scandals.</p>
      <p>It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>According to the indictment, Mr Netanyahu accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends, offered to trade favours with a newspaper publisher, and used his influence to help a wealthy telecoms magnate in exchange for favourable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>The indictment does not require Mr Netanyahu to resign but is expected to raise pressure on him to step down.</p>

      <p>He is due to make a statement later on Thursday, having already called the allegations part of a witch-hunt against him.</p>
      <p>Mr Mandelblit said his “heavy-hearted decision” was based solely on professional considerations, and he rejected suggestions the indictment was politically motivated.</p>
      <p>He angrily criticised pressure from both Mr Netanyahu’s supporters and foes to sway his decision.</p>
      <p>The most serious charges are connected to so-called “Case 4000”, in which Mr Netanyahu is accused of passing regulations that gave his friend, telecoms magnate Shaul Elovitch, benefits worth tens of millions to his company Bezeq.</p>
      <p>In return, Bezeq’s news site Walla published favourable articles about the PM and his family.</p>
      <p>The indictment also said Mr Netanyahu’s gifts of champagne from billionaires Arnon Milchan and James Packer “turned into a sort of supply line”.</p>
      <p>And it accuses Mr Netanyahu of assisting Israeli Mr Milchan, a Hollywood mogul, in extending his US visa.</p>
      <p>Two close aides to Mr Netanyahu testified against him in the case.</p>
      <p>Israel has recently held two inconclusive elections, with a third likely amid an ongoing political impasse.</p>
