      <h1>"Make apprenticeship free like free SHS" – Artisans appeal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:35:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">Odoom Prince Linford, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Assin-Fosu (C/R), Nov. 20, GNA - Mr John Essuman, the Central Regional President of the Ghana Cooperative Fashion Designers and Beauticians Association, has called on government to introduce measures to ensure that children are given free vocational training options as their counterparts attending free Senior High School (SHS).</p>
      <p>This, he said, would greatly contribute to the development of the youth and ensure a reduction of the unemployment rate.</p>
      <p>Mr Essuman, who described government's focus on SHS as “an unfair distribution of the national kitty”, said it is now imperative to pay attention to the plight of children in vocational and artisan training sector".</p>
      <p>He made the call at a graduation ceremony held for 32 beauticians and dressmakers in the Fosu Municipality.</p>
      <p>"If government has been able to implement the free SHS policy, it can equally put in place measures that will offer opportunities to those who are not interested in SHS education but in various apprenticeship programmes."</p>
      <p>The Regional President of the Association expressed optimism that Ghana would attain sustainable economic independence if government intensifies its attention on the technical and vocational education sector.</p>
      <p>Mr Essuman said lack of financial support for the adolescent in apprenticeship is one challenge denying many of their dream to pursue a vocation.</p>
      <p>"Many young people are willing to go into apprenticeship but lack of money has been a barrier for majority of them. Sometimes their "masters" are forced to cater for some of them".</p>
      <p>Mr Essuman called on parents to prioritize family planning and prepare to adequately support the number of children they intend to have as this would inure to their own benefit.</p>
      <p>Education and vocation training is the only solid foundation parents can bequeath to their children and this wealth of support cannot be disputed or challenged by family members when the death of a parent occurs, he said.</p>
      <p>The graduating apprentices were urged not to abandon their work but adapt to cultural dynamics to grow their businesses.</p>
      <p>Mr Nicholas Fiifi Baako, the Assin Fosu Municipal Chief Executive, congratulated the graduands for their determination to go through all the odds to successfully complete their three years of apprenticeship.</p>
