      <p>An arrogant female pedophile who spent months raping a 14 year-old family friend has failed in her bid to be freed from jail.</p>
      <p>Tanya Lynn Wiginton, 39, was denied parole Wednesday, almost four years after she was convicted of second-degree rape of the boy.</p>
      <p>Wiginton, of Franklin County in Alabama, must now complete her entire seven year sentence behind bars, meaning she will not be freed from jail until 2023.</p>
      <p>Hailing the decision, Franklin County District Attorney Joey Rushing told the <a href="https://www.timesdaily.com/news/crime/woman-s-appeal-is-denied/article_fabdf079-2cd4-5c55-88ed-f5b536200543.html">Times Daily</a>: ‘That’s who prisons are made for, in my opinion, is those who offend against children and commit a sex crime.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a priority to try to keep sex offenders in prison as long as possible</p>

      <p>‘That’s why they have to register.’</p>
      <p>Franklin originally spent just two years in jail over the 2014 sex attacks.</p>
      <p>She had embarked on an illegal relationship with her underage victim, which lasted for three months.</p>
      <p>Her sentence was split into time served while awaiting her trial in 2016, with the remainder suspended on the condition she agreed to certain terms.</p>
      <p>But Wiginton was ordered back behind bars in February 2017 after showing a ‘disregard’ for her sentence.</p>
      <p>The pervert was found to have broken the terms of her probation by failing to register as a sex offender, and failing to tell her probation officer where she was living.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the time, Rushing said: ‘She didn’t do anything she was told to do. This was nothing but a blatant disrespect for the court.’</p>
