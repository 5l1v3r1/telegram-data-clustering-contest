      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> has been upping its <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/true-crime-tv-series-docuseries-documentary/">true crime</a> game over the past year, but this is the one that may blow your mind the most.</p>
      <p>2015 film Dream/Killer has been bought by the streaming service, and sees Making a Murderer’s Kathleen Zellner of a man who was convicted of murder – based on the testimony of a dream someone had.</p>
      <p>Ryan Ferguson was 20 years old when he was convicted for the 2001 murder of 48-year-old Kent Heitholt, a sports reporter found dead outside his offices in Columbia, Missouri.</p>

      <p>Heitholt was found on the floor having been strangled by his own belt.</p>
      <p>Just 17 at the time of the murder, in 2005 he Ferguson was sentenced to 40 years in jail for the killing – and triggered a 10 year battle spearheaded by his father Bill to get him freed.</p>
      <p>The biggest piece of evidence that sold the jury? An anonymous tip-off to Charles ‘Chuck’ Erickson, who had taken drugs the night of the crime, and after spending time with Ryan that evening, had dreamed they may have committed it.</p>
      <p>Yup. That’s it. That’s the evidence.</p>

      <p>‘I didn’t know if it was memory, or if it was a dream. I assumed that if I’d done it, Ryan and I did it to get more money for drink,’ Erickson is seen telling cameras in the documentary.</p>
      <p>Spurred on by police evidence and ‘remembering things’ while they were interrogating him, Chuck implicated himself in the crimes as well as Ryan.</p>
      <p>But Bill Ferguson knew his son was innocent, and as a result when on his own mission for justice.</p>
      <p>Hiring Kathleen Zellner to support his son, Bill goes on a mission to get Ryan freed, but was repeatedly refused a retrial despite the growing among of evidence supporting his innocence.</p>

      <p>In 2013, Ryan was finally released, and continues to support those who also insist they’re innocent after he himself was exonerated.</p>
      <p>He now works as a personal trainer and health and fitness guru, and temporarily hosted an MTV series called Unlocking The Truth, which focuses on the potential innocence of prisoners.</p>
