      <h1>I'm a Celeb criticised by Buglife charity after banning the eating of live insects but allowing contestant to crush them </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:46:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/jessica-carpani/" target="_blank">Jessica Carpani</a></address>
      <p>I'M A Celebrity....Get Me Out Of Here has been criticised by the charity Buglife for banning the eating of live insects but allowing its contestant to crush them during trials.</p>
      <p>The ITV reality show set in Australia announced it would ban its infamous live critter eating tasks in this year’s show following an outcry from animal rights groups.</p>
      <p>Last week it was confirmed that producers had been planning the decision “for some time.''</p>
      <p>A show source added: “Last year beach worms were the only critters eaten live but this time around they’ve decided to implement the change fully and permanently.”</p>
      <p>But the show faced a backlash from animal rights charities this week after a contestant crushed dozens of cockroaches during a Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s task left comedian Andrew Maxwell with remnants of the bugs stuck to his hands, neck and face with animal rights charities calling the show's exploitation of animals "tired, tacky and moronic".</p>
      <p>Buglife, the invertebrate conservation trust, said it was the “21st Century equivalent of bear baiting”.</p>
      <p>The challenge took place on episode three of the long-running hit show, which averages nine million viewers per series.</p>

      <p>Viewers watched as Andrew Maxwell was screwed into a perspex helmet which was then filled with hundreds of cockroaches.</p>
      <p>As he fought to keep the bugs off him, many were crushed to death on the side of the perspex, while his hands were also covered in bits of dead bugs.</p>
      <p>After he finished the task, one cockroach was removed from his ear, while the debris from other dead bugs could clearly be seen stuck to his neck.</p>
      <p>Ofcom confirmed it had received four complaints about the incident and were deciding whether or not to investigate.</p>
      <p>A BugLife spokesman said: "After 20 years on screen I'M A Celebrity....Get Me Out Of Here has made a first small step to recognise the rights and acceptable behaviour towards sentient animals banning eating them live.</p>
      <p>“Sadly though the show continues to vilify these animals feeding on phobias and failing to respect the dignity of other lifeforms by using them to sell cheap thrills.</p>
      <p>“In any ways this show is a 21st Century equivalent of bear baiting.”</p>
      <p>PETA's director, Elisa Allen said: "After nearly two decades on our screens, during which thousands of complaints have been logged with Ofcom, it's beyond shameful that I'm a Celeb is still allowed to roll out the same tired, tacky, moronic, and - worse - cruel 'challenges' year after year.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for ITV added: "As a production, I'm A Celebrity complies with all regional and national laws concerning the use of insects, animals and reptiles.</p>
      <p>"We inform the RSPCA NSW of all of our activities on the show and they have an open invitation to attend the site at any time.</p>
      <p>“At each of the Bushtucker Trials which feature animals or insects, we have qualified and experienced animal handlers on site."</p>
