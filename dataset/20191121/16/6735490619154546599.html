      <p>The intent behind the video was to juxtapose the oddity of the saddened perception of the clowns with their obvious companionship and the strength of it revealed in the video,” Good said in a statement. “It’s a comment on how, in this day and age, the complexities of emotion are presented as uncomfortable. That one must be a standardized happy to be happy.”</p>
      <p>Stefan Berrill, the mind behind some of Dallas Smith and The Washboard Union’s hit music videos, directed the new visual.</p>
