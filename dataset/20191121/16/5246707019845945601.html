      <p>Remember how muddled the marketing was for the Wii U? Nintendo didn't have a clue how to 'sell' the concept of the system, and this undoubtedly contributed to its lacklustre commercial performance. However, with Switch, the company isn't making the same mistake twice and its promotional activities have been pretty much on point since it was first announced.</p>
      <p>Now, with Switch looking set to <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/nintendo_switch_looks_set_to_end_ps4s_five-year_reign_in_the_uk">unseat the PlayStation 4 as the UK's best-selling console</a>, Nintendo UK has launched a special commercial which really hammers home the core selling points of the hybrid console.</p>
      <p>Entitled "Play together anytime, anywhere on Nintendo Switch", the commercial is almost three minutes long and shows a series of friends, families and individuals all enjoying their Switch consoles in slightly different ways.</p>

      <p>There's a group of schoolkids finding time to take on a raid battle in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></b>, as well as a pair of friends enjoying a quick <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> match before dinner. Elsewhere, families take on the likes of <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ring_fit_adventure">Ring Fit Adventure</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_sonic_at_the_olympic_games_tokyo_2020">Sonic &amp; Mario at the Olympic Games 2020</a></b>, while a doting mother solves puzzles in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/laytons_mystery_journey_katrielle_and_the_millionaires_conspiracy_-_deluxe_edition">Layton's Mystery Journey</a></b>. Oh, and don't forget the mum who keeps her grey matter in shape with a spot of <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dr_kawashimas_brain_training_for_nintendo_switch">Brain Training</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The commercial is packed with other games, too – including <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite">Fortnite</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_2">Splatoon 2</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/luigis_mansion_3">Luigi's Mansion 3</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></b> – and does a superb job of communicating what Switch is all about. We imagine promotional activity like this is only going to help when it comes to shifting hardware and software during the holiday season, but let us know what you think by posting a comment below.</p>
