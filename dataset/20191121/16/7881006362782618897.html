      <p>The West Bengal Chief Minister said, "As you know our party is against disinvestment, however, in a positive sense some mergers can be done, but if Bengal's leading bank like United Bank of India (UBI) is shifted to another place then what will happen to our schemes."</p>
      <p>"India is a country where cashless society never runs, after demonetization these digital transactions increased, I don't have any objection in that but for making a cashless society people are left with less cash, and without cashflow how businesses will be done, how agriculture, industries, and shops will run," she added.</p>
