      <p>Police have launched a murder enquiry after a mum was 'deliberately' run down by a car and killed.</p>
      <p>Alison McBlaine, 36, died this afternoon in hospital after a Fiat Punto Grande - believed to be on cloned number plates - "deliberately mounted the pavement" and crashed into her and a second pedestrian before driving off, said police.</p>
      <p>Lancashire Constabulary said Alison died with her family, including her 12-year-old son Reagan, by her bedside, after being hit in Blackburn on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The second pedestrian, a 26-year-old man from Blackburn, suffered "more minor injuries" after being hit.</p>
      <p>Police said the horrific incident happened at 7.48pm on November 19, on Whalley Banks at the junction with Pearson Street.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the force said: "The car, believed to be on cloned number plates, failed to stop at the scene of the collision and a similar car was later found on Lower Hollin Bank Street with significant front end damage.</p>
      <p>"Attempts had been made to set the vehicle on fire. It has now been recovered as part of our investigation."</p>
      <p>Police last night arrested a 25-year-old from Blackburn on suspicion of attempted murder. He remains in custody.</p>

      <p>Detective chief inspector Lee Wilson said: “Alison sadly passed away from her injuries today and my thoughts remain with her and her loved ones, including her young son.</p>
      <p>"This is now a murder investigation and I have a team of detectives and staff continuing to work hard on this investigation and we continue to follow a number of different lines of inquiry.</p>
      <p>“While we have made one arrest our enquiries are very much on-going and I would continue to appeal to anyone who can help us find out what has happened and who has carried out this horrific act to come forward.</p>
