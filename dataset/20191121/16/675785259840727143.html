      <h1>Boris Johnson's general election battle bus stranded due to 'mirror problem'</h1>
      <h2>Less than a day after the Mirror was banned from the Tory campaign bus in a move branded 'disturbing', the coach broke down and went nowhere for 45 minutes today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:08:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, Joseph Wilkes, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson's battle bus was stranded for 45 minutes due to its second 'mirror problem' in as many days.</p>
      <p>But this time it had nothing to do with Mirror journalists being banned from the bus - but due to a faulty wing mirror.</p>
      <p>The campaign coach was forced to stop on a housing estate after a technical fault rendered it unsafe to drive.</p>
      <p>The driver eventually fixed the problem on the Mercedes-Benz Tourismo coach, which was unveiled by the Prime Minister at an event last week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> was not on board at the time, having travelled by train to the housing development in Wixams, Bedford, earlier on Thursday.</p>
      <p>BBC journalist Nick Eardley tweeted: "Uh oh... Tory campaign bus temporarily stranded in Bedfordshire. There was a problem with the mechanical wing mirror. The PM wasn’t on board. It’s fixed now and we’re off again." <br/> </p>
      <p>Senior Tory aides told the Mirror as early as last week they could have access to the trip - the Tory leader’s first with the bus - but pulled the offer at the last minute.</p>
      <p>Our reporter was then blocked from boarding the red, white and blue emblazoned campaign coach when she arrived in Manchester city centre, where it set off just before 8am.</p>

      <p>The Conservative Party faced a backlash over their decision to ban Mirror journalists from Boris Johnson's election battle bus.</p>
      <p>Media figures criticised the move as an attack on freedom of the press and a strategic blunder.</p>
      <p>ITV's Robert Peston said: "Given that Boris Johnson wants to win traditional <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> seats, is it wise for the Tories to bar the Mirror from their bus?"</p>

      <p>Labour MP <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-lammy">David Lammy</a> said: "Journalists who value press freedom should stand in solidarity with Daily Mirror and refuse to get on Boris Johnson's bus.</p>
      <p>"The alternative is normalising and legitimising Donald Trump's tactics in the UK."</p>
      <p>And senior Tory sources said that several Cabinet ministers were “uncomfortable” with the move and thought it was a “bad look” for the party to be excluding the media.</p>
      <p>Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors said: "All mainstream media should be given equal access to the political parties fighting this election.</p>
      <p>"To restrict some media voices is not acceptable nor compatible with the principle of media freedom."</p>
