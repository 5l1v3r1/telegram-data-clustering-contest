      <p>Many would have felt that the last-gasp 2-1 defeat at Liverpool on October 5 would have led to Leicester losing their way in the Premier League, but the disappointment of missing out on a share of the spoils at Anfield has only added extra motivation to this Foxes side.</p>
      <p>Fifteen goals have been scored and just one conceded during a run of four successive victories, and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brendan-rodgers/"><b>Brendan Rodgers</b></a> will see no reason why his squad cannot continue to have a presence in the top four.</p>
      <p>Before facing a double-header against Manchester City and Liverpool over the Christmas period, Leicester have five matches in front of them which they will consider themselves to be favourites.</p>
      <p>While wins are far from a certainty, Rodgers knows that there is an opportunity to create further distance between themselves and the rest of the clubs who are chasing a Champions League place for next season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jamie-vardy/"><b>Jamie Vardy</b></a> has, almost inevitably, been a key part of their recent run, and the Englishman will want to add to a streak which has seen him net six times from four outings.</p>
      <p>As for Brighton, boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/graham-potter/"><b>Graham Potter</b></a> will expect a positive response from his team after they <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/result/result-manchester-united-cruise-past-brighton-to-move-up-to-seventh_378570.html">succumbed to a 3-1 defeat</a> at the hands of Manchester United before the international break.</p>
      <p>Conceding two early goals kept Brighton on the back foot for much of the contest, although Potter is aware that returning to winning ways this weekend could potentially take the club into the top six.</p>
      <p>Regardless of whether they win, lose or draw on Saturday, little will be made of their league position, but Potter will feel like his players need to earn at least a point with trips to Liverpool and Arsenal to follow over the next two weeks.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jonny-evans/"><b>Jonny Evans</b></a> is a major doubt for Leicester due to illness, which Northern Ireland boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-oneill/"><b>Michael O'Neill</b></a> claims led to him being 'quarantined' earlier in the week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-maddison/"><b>James Maddison</b></a> is also carrying a calf injury, leaving Rodgers to decide whether it is worth taking a risk on the playmaker.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-webster/"><b>Adam Webster</b></a> out injured and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-dunk/"><b>Lewis Dunk</b></a> serving a one-match ban, Potter must decide whether to use a back four or opt for his preferred back three.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the formation, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/leon-balogun/"><b>Leon Balogun</b></a> is expected to make a rare start for Brighton, potentially as a partner for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/shane-duffy/"><b>Shane Duffy</b></a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/glenn-murray/"><b>Glenn Murray</b></a> could be provided with a start in attack if <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aaron-connolly/"><b>Aaron Connolly</b></a> does not shake off a groin injury.</p>
      <p><b>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion possible starting lineup:</b> Ryan; Montoya, Balogun, Duffy, Burn; March, Propper, Stephens, Gross; Maupay, Murray</p>
      <p><b>Leicester City possible starting lineup:</b> Schmeichel; Pereira, Morgan, Soyuncu, Chilwell; Ndidi, Tielemans, Praet; Perez, Barnes, Vardy</p>

      <h3>We say: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 1-2 Leicester City</h3>
      <p>While Brighton will be confident of earning at least a share of the spoils on the south coast, we cannot back against a Leicester team who are showing both flair and resolve in their bid to remain as the closest challengers to leaders Liverpool.</p>
