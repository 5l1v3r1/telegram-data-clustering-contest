      <h1>ESPN Predicts What’ll Happen If Penn State Beats Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:47:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Right now, the College Football Playoff appears to be heading towards a field of LSU, Ohio State, Clemson, and one from the group of Georgia, Oregon, Alabama, Utah, with a few others waiting in the wings. It would only take one upset to send things topsy-turvy as we near the end of the season.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night, during ESPN’s rankings release show, <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/espn-college-football-playoff-rankings-kirk-hersbtreit-rece-davis-nightmare-scenario-ohio-state-minnesota-georgia-lsu">Rece Davis introduced a “nightmare scenario,”</a> where Minnesota wins out and beats undefeated Ohio State for the Big Ten title, and Georgia beats LSU for the SEC title. That would really send thing for a spin, and it isn’t that unreasonable, given how explosive the Golden Gophers have looked at times this year.</p>
      <p>We might not have to wait for the Big Ten Championship Game for things to get weird, though. Penn State travels to Ohio State this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Nittany Lions are big 18-point underdogs in Columbus, so a win isn’t particularly likely. James Franklin’s team is one of the best in the country though, and upsets of that magnitude happen all the time in college football. A win would likely send PSU to the Big Ten title, setting up either a game against Wisconsin, or a rematch with the Minnesota team that handed it its only loss.</p>
      <p>On today’s episode of <i>Get Up </i>on ESPN, college football reporter Maria Taylor and former Texas star Emmanuel Acho debated the impact of a potential Penn State win on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Taylor has a somewhat controversial take, stating that Ohio State could still get in over a Penn State team that beat it en route to the Big Ten Championship.</p>
      <blockquote>“They wouldn’t play in the Big Ten Championship Game, but they would still be one of the top four teams going to the College Football Playoff, with Penn State going to the Rose Bowl… I think Ohio State can afford one loss.”</blockquote>
      <p>Acho says that Penn State’s resume, which would also potentially include a revenge game against the Golden Gophers, would be too much to argue against.</p>
      <blockquote>“I absolutely disagree. I think Ohio State can’t afford it. If Ohio State loses to Penn State, Ohio State doesn’t go to the Big Ten Championship Game, and even bigger than that, Penn State likely plays Minnesota and can beat Minnesota…so Penn State can say ‘we beat every team on our schedule.'”</blockquote>
      <p>Taylor responded, citing the 2017 Alabama team as an example of the committee identifying that the likely best team might not have had the most obvious resume, but ultimately won out when it got to the postseason. She thinks Ohio State could similarly fit the bill.</p>
      <blockquote>“You would be remiss if you left Ohio State, which is probably the most balanced team we have right now, out of the conversation to play for a national championship.”</blockquote>
      <p>The 2017 Alabama situation was a bit different. Auburn handed Alabama its loss that year, and stole the SEC West bid, but went on to lose to Georgia in the SEC Championship Game. Had the Tigers won, they likely become the first two-loss team in Playoff history. Alabama and Georgia both wound up in the field.</p>
      <p>It would also be different than 2016 Ohio State, though that might be the more similar comparison. That year, Penn State beat Ohio State 24-21, going on to win the Big Ten Championship, but had to settle for the Rose Bowl. Ohio State reached the Playoff as a one-loss at-large team, due in large part to Penn State’s two early season losses to Pitt and Michigan.</p>
      <p>New precedents get set every year in College Football Playoff voting, so you can’t quite take every individual situation as gospel for ones going forward.</p>
