        <b>Investment Thesis</b>
      </p>
      <p>Salesforce (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM">CRM</a>) is a stock I've been bearish for a considerable amount of time since I <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4201687-salesforce-com-edge">first</a> opined on it more than a year ago (August 2018):</p>

      <p>Thus far, as you can see above, neither bears nor bulls have connivingly settled the argument here.</p>
      <p>But yesterday, Salesforce released its highly anticipated long-term guidance during its <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/574569502/files/doc_presentations/Dreamforce">Dreamforce</a> conference.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Long-Term Targets Discussed</b>
      </p>
      <p>Salesforce's growth rates are highlighted below:</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Source: author's calculations (including fiscal 2020 guidance)</p>
      <p>Including Salesforce's raised fiscal 2020 guidance to $17 billion, we can see that Salesforce has been delivering shareholders with incredibly strong revenue growth rates.</p>
      <p>Followers of this space are obviously cognizant that Salesforce's acquisition-heavy lead growth has played a significant role in ensuring that Salesforce grows at a rapid clip.</p>
      <p>The problem for shareholders is that as Salesforce becomes bigger, it becomes increasingly challenging to find a suitable acquisition target trading anywhere near fair value, that would be happy to be acquired.</p>
      <p>What's more, is even if smaller companies were willing to be picked up at a small premium, they would be unlikely to shift the needle on Salesforce's consolidated top line.</p>
      <p>Consequently, even on the top-end of its FY 2021 guidance, Salesforce's top line is only expected to grow 23% year-over-year.</p>

      <p>Why is this a problem? Because its shareholders have become accustomed to +25% revenue growth rates, and any deceleration will see the multiple investors are willing to pay compress.</p>
      <p>Looking further ahead, we see this effect repeated, but this time to a larger extent:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/21/17546952-15743337578954105.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Salesforce is subtly priming the investment community that its current 26%-28% revenue growth rates are going to come down to 20% growth rates in the very near term.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Valuation - Investors' Confidence Is Sky High</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thus, we are presented with a quandary.</p>
      <figure>

      </p>
      <p>As we can see in the graph above, investors have been all too happy to throw caution to the wind and pay an ever-increasing P/Sales multiple to participate in this high growth story.</p>
      <p>I surmise that many shareholders have failed to ask the challenging (<i>albeit necessary</i>) fundamental question of when Salesforce's growth rates would slow down from north of 26%? And if so, by how much? Never mind asking <i>how soon</i>.</p>
      <p>I have one final graph which I believe puts forward the bearish thesis and the bullish thesis together succinctly:</p>

      <p>Bulls point towards Salesforce's rapidly growing revenues, backed by its stable and predictable non-GAAP operating margins, which is expected to finish fiscal 2020 at 16.6%.</p>
      <p>Whereas bears would start off the discussion focused on the fact that Salesforce's FY 2020 GAAP operating margins are expected to compress all the way down to 3.8% and that for a cloud-based enterprise is a very tight profit margin.</p>
      <p>Next, the fact that Salesforce's GAAP operating margins are compressing <i>and</i> its revenue growth is declining, doesn't that imply that Salesforce is not getting a return on invested capital commensurate with that of a more mature SaaS company?</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Bottom Line</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have attempted to put forward an evidence-based discussion of Salesforce's near-term potential.</p>
      <p>Shareholders are presented with a rare combination of decelerating growth rates, compressing GAAP profit margins and an elevated share price. I strongly contend investors would do well to sidestep this investment.</p>
      <p>Salesforce is days away from reporting its Q3 2020 results. Stay tuned!</p>
      <p>
