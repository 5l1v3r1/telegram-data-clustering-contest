      <p>The company has raised $10 million in venture capital funding, led by <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_6ae46a13e3d2d9764d5e123fc23b3c34">Khosla Ventures</a> , as well as Initalized Capital, Zigg Capital, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_b34b877b3eb0b73681259a04bf1830da">Bessemer Venture Partners</a> and <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_2d57a7525dd24b5f9ab4460339b5f0ed">Y Combinator</a> .</p>
      <p>The 16-acre site at 2025 E. Apache Blvd. was chosen for the first car-free neighborhood because of the city's thriving job market, growing population and land available on a light rail station, according to a company statement.</p>
