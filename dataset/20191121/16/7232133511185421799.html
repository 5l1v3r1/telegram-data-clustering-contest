        <b>2. Users and security are second to nothing</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jay Hao highlighted in the AMA session, <i>“Users and security are second to nothing, and it is about the security of funds, trading, data and privacy.”</i> According to the AMA, OKEx has recovered over 400 million US dollars for their users, and the cryptocurrency exchange has also divided the assets between multisig cold wallets with around 500BTC each so that the risk could be better managed and controlled. As mentioned by Jay Hao, there has been no security issue on OKEx.</p>

        <b>3. OKChain is to be launched, OKDex will be the first DApp</b>

The decentralized exchange, OKDex, will be the first DApp launched on this blockchain infrastructure. Also, OKB, the native token circulating in the OKEx ecosystem, will be equipped with more use cases in different fields, including cybersecurity, finance, lifestyle services and more.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. OKEx offers wider range of products compared to its competitors</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the AMA session, when talking about the difference from their competitors, Jay Hao mentioned the wider range of products could be one of the ways they stay ahead of other exchanges in the market.

        <b>5. OKEx Pool supports PoW and PoS mining of 9 major cryptocurrencies</b>
      </p>
