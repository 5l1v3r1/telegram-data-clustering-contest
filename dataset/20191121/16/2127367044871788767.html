      <h2>India vs Bangladesh: Former captain Dilip Vengsarkar said India's fist-ever day-night Test is happening at one of the best grounds in India.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:30:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Indo-Asian News Service</a></address>
      <p>Former captain <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/kl-rahuls-technique-makes-him-ideal-for-no-4-dilip-vengsarkar-2038737">Dilip Vengsarkar</a> on Thursday hailed Sourav Ganguly, saying the first Pink Ball Test in India is a feather in the BCCI President's cap as he was the man behind making it happen. "A cricketing background always helps any administrator to take the right decisions. He has been a very good cricketer, hence, its a right decision as an administrator. The first pink test in India is happening under his leadership which is another feather in his cap," Vengsarkar said at a promotional event in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>India were apprehensive about playing a pink ball Test and even refused one at Adelaide against Australia last year.</p>
      <p>But after becoming the BCCI President, <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/sourav-ganguly-very-excited-about-india-vs-bangladesh-day-night-test-2135819">Ganguly emphasised on the issue</a>. He said it took captain Virat Kohli only three seconds to agree to it.</p>
      <p>India will take on Bangladesh at <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/ind-vs-ban-day-night-test-venue-eden-gardens-profile-2136334">Eden Gardens in Kolkata</a> on Friday, which is the second Test of the series. The rampaging hosts won the first rubber by an innings and 130 runs.</p>
      <p>"We will have to wait and see," Vengsarkar said about pink ball test's future.</p>
      <p>"It is happening at one of the best grounds in India -- Eden. I scored my first hundred here which I remember vividly. As a captain, I also scored a hundred against West Indies. It is one of my favourite grounds. I am sure it will be a success. I hope it brings more people to the grounds. The timing is very good. Those who work can also come and watch. In Australia, it was a huge success," the 63-year-old added.</p>
      <p>"It's a good innovation. One day cricket came in the 70s and then T20s came with the 2007 World Cup. Now we have T10 as well," he concluded.</p>
