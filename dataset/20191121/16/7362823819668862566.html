      <p>The arresting police officer said that Hunt smelled of alcohol, had "bloodshot" and "watery" eyes, and there were "two empty beer cans" next to him. Hunt had "difficulty retrieving his ID and attempted to give a credit card and passport instead," the report said.</p>
      <p>Hunt was alone in the car and admitted to "consuming alcohol recently," police said. He was read his rights, then performed a sobriety test administered by the arresting officer and was breathalyzed. His blood-alcohol level was .173, according to the arrest warrant.</p>
