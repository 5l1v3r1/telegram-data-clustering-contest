      <p><b>Bengaluru:</b> Ruling BJP in Karnataka on Thursday expelled from its primary membership rebels Sharath Bachegowda and Kaviraj Urs, contesting the coming assembly bypolls as independent candidates, for anti-party activity.</p>
      <p>In separate letters to both Bachegowda fighting from Hoskote assembly constituency and Urs from Vijayanagara, the BJP said their contest against the party's official candidates was being considered as anti-party activity.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The BJP on Wednesday had asked party rebels to withdraw their candidature by Thursday evening, the last day to do so for the bypolls to 15 assembly constituencies in the state to be held on December 5.</p>
