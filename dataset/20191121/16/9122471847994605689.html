      <h1>Tom Brady Explains His Reaction To Antonio Brown’s Apology</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:00:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday, former New England Patriot <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/antonio-brown-message-robert-kraft-sexual-assault-allegations-future-new-england-patriots">Antonio Brown apologized</a> for a September tweet he made disparaging owner Robert Kraft after the team waived him. Brown played one game for the team, after a very public divorce from the Oakland Raiders.</p>
      <p>The week following that game against the Miami Dolphins, in which Brown caught a touchdown pass from Tom Brady, rape allegations levied against Brown by a former trainer of his surfaced. He was cut, and is currently on the league’s exempt list.</p>
      <p>The response to Brown’s apology raised some eyebrows. Numerous Patriots, including prominent players like Stephon Gilmore, Dont’a Hightower, and James White “liked” the post on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Naturally, that led to speculation that Brown could return to the club, if the NFL deems he can play again this season, a decision <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/nfl-insider-reveals-latest-on-antonio-browns-potential-return">that could come soon</a>.</p>
      <p>Tom Brady was also on that list of players, and explains why he decided to “like” Brown’s post. From the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/11/21/tom-brady-patriots-explain-why-they-liked-antonio-browns-apology-to-robert-kraft/"><i>Boston Herald</i></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I liked him. We had a great rapport when we were here,” Brady told the Herald. “I’m trying to support him to be the best person that he can be, that’s all.”<br/><br/>So Brady wasn’t trying to sway Mr. Kraft into bringing Brown back?<br/><br/>“It’s that time of year,” said Brady. “People put a lot of words in people’s mouths. It’s just part of the world we’re living in.”</blockquote>
      <p>Brady went into more detail about how, at 42 and in the twilight of his career, he likes to help those around him develop as players, like the the old guard of Patriots veterans did for him early in his career.</p>
      <blockquote>“For me, I’m just at this stage of my career, I’m 42 years old. I want to help everybody I can that I come across in this locker room, my friends, to be the best they can be. And how I can support them the best way possible,” he said. “I feel like I have a lot of experience. Part of being a leader in this locker room is trying to help people understand the challenges of being in the positions that they’re in. I think that’s a really fun thing for me, as I’ve gotten older, is to embrace that, like Drew Bledsoe did for me, like Lawyer Milloy did for me, like Tedy Bruschi did for me, like Mike Vrabel did for me, like Rodney Harrison did for me. And now, I’m in their position, so, it’s my responsibility to convey to them what it takes to have a great, successful career.”</blockquote>
      <p>Other players like Gilmore and Phillip Dorsett told the Herald that they were only reacting to the photo that Antonio Brown posted with the apology, of him celebrating with Brady, and weren’t actually commenting on his message. It doesn’t sound like any of them are particularly endorsing his return to Foxboro, if he is cleared to play, though based on Brady’s comments he wouldn’t mind having a weapon of Brown’s ability for the stretch run.</p>
