      <h1>Arsenal star fuels transfer talk and names ‘dream’ club for the future</h1>

        <b>Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira has fuelled doubt over his future by admitting he will have to wait and see what happens in the next transfer window.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Uruguay international initially looked a fine signing for the Gunners when he joined from Sampdoria last season, getting off to a strong start to life in the Premier League.</p>
      <h3>MORE: <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/20/good-news-for-arsenal-fans-as-unai-emery-favourite-to-be-the-next-sacked-manager/">Good news for Arsenal fans as Unai Emery favourite to be the next sacked manager</a></h3>
      <p>However, it’s fair to say Torreira hasn’t quite looked the part in recent times and has increasingly fallen out of favour with Arsenal manager Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>When he has played, Torreira hasn’t always been used in his preferred defensive midfield role, having rather bizarrely been used in an unfamiliar, more attack-minded role further forward.</p>
      <p>It is therefore unsurprising to see talk surfacing of the 23-year-old potentially leaving the Emirates Stadium, with <a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/casemiro-tiene-recambio-tapado-florentino-perez-premier">Don Balon</a> linking him as a target for Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans will surely be hoping Torreira doesn’t leave, but his latest comments to Tiempo de Futbol, as translated by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-transfer-news-lucas-torreira-rumours-gossip-boca-uruguay-emery-epl-a9211991.html">Independent</a>, won’t necessarily fill Gooners with confidence.</p>

      <p>Torreira even mentioned a future potential destination in Boca Juniors as he admitted playing for them is a dream of his.</p>
      <p>“Today Arsenal needs me to be focused. I can’t start talking about another team,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I need to be focused and when the transfer period arrives we will see what happens.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what will happen in the future. But I would like to be able to play for Boca. It’s a dream I have for what that institution represents.”</p>
