      <h1>Lane Kiffin Responds To Fan Asking About The Arkansas Job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:30:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The Chad Morris era at Arkansas didn’t even last two seasons, and now, the program must find another head coach that could rebuild its image as soon as possible. Despite not being listed as a candidate for the job, there is one fan that really wants Lane Kiffin to become the team’s next coach.</p>
      <p>Last week, a fan tweeted out their support for Kiffin. The reason for wanting him to be the next coach is because of his offensive background and ability to recruit at a marquee school.</p>
      <p>Kiffin didn’t immediately see the post on Twitter, but he did respond roughly a week later.</p>
      <p>It’s safe to say that Kiffin isn’t ready to leave his job at Florida Atlantic.</p>
      <p>He did appreciate the support from this fan. Nonetheless, it’d take a lot for him to leave Boca Raton.</p>

      <p>Arkansas has interest in hiring Memphis coach Mike Norvell, who is <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/florida-state/arkansas-coaching-candidate-is-more-interested-in-florida-state">reportedly linked</a> to the Florida State job.</p>
      <p>Kiffin is currently in his third year at Florida Atlantic. After a disappointing 5-7 record in 2018, the Owls have bounced back to an impressive 7-3 start.</p>
      <p>It’d be really interesting if the Razorbacks actually hired Kiffin to be their head coach, but there’s no reason to believe that will actually happen.</p>
