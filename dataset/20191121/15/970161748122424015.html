      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> has been accused of misleading voters again with a video of Labour candidate Jess Phillips.</p>
      <p>The video was tweeted by the party’s official account – @CCHQPress – to coincide with the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/jeremy-corbyn-says-hell-nationalise-mail-rail-water-energy-manifesto-launch-11194398/">launch of Labour’s manifesto.</a></p>
      <p>In it, Labour’s candidate for Birmingham Yardley, 37, says: ‘You can never, ever deliver all of those things that you are pretending to deliver when you go to the electorate.’</p>
      <p>Ms Phillips’ statement was edited out of an interview she gave on Good Morning Britain on 3 October, while promoting her new book.</p>
      <p>The interview was re-aired on the ITV breakfast show this morning during an interview with shadow education secretary Angela Rayner.</p>

      <p>The @CCHQPress account – which earlier this week caused outrage by changing its name to ‘FactcheckUK’ – used a snippet of it in a tweet that dated the video 21 November, 2019.</p>

      <p>During the original interview, Ms Phillips was questioned by Susanna Reid about keeping manifesto promises – before the General Election was even announced.</p>
      <p>Ms Phillips said: ‘I think there is an argument to be said that you can never, ever deliver all of those things that you are pretending to deliver when you go to the electorate.</p>
      <p>‘In reality, things change. Globally things change, situations change. Facts change. [We can’t deliver it] in all cases.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t control the trade war between America and China and I have to, each and every day, and at the moment it is on a day-by-day basis and it is not good, and I have to say, “what is the best thing, the best decision I can make today to make sure my constituents are better off?”‘</p>

      <p>The @CCHQPress video edit also labelled Ms Phillips a ‘Corbyn ally’ despite her being a vocal critic of the Labour leader in the past, going as far as to say he wasn’t the ‘practical choice’ for leader because people would not vote for him.</p>
      <p>But it’s not the first time the Tories have been accused of misleading the public with a video on its Twitter account.</p>
      <p>On 5 November, they were accused of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/tory-chairman-james-cleverly-defends-using-doctored-clip-smear-labour-11049261/">unfairly editing a video of Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer</a>, to make him appear unable to answer a question on Brexit.</p>

      <p>And today, as Mr Corbyn announced his manifesto, the Conservatives launched a website to attack the party’s policies.</p>
      <p>The Tory run<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/tories-launch-fake-labour-manifesto-website-despite-factcheckuk-backlash-11194311/"> Labourmanifesto.co.uk website was launched</a> moments before Mr Corbyn took to the stage in Birmingham today.</p>
      <p>It accuses the party of promising ‘higher taxes’ with ‘no plan for Brexit’.</p>
      <p>The Tories have apparently paid Google advertising fees so their site appears at the of the page when some users search ‘Labour’.</p>
