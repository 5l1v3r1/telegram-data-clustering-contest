      <h1>WATCH: Heckling Parents Cause Youth Baseball Umpire to Walk Off the Field | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Umpiring in baseball is not for the faint of heart. Umpiring in youth baseball can be even tougher.</h2>

      <p>Such was the case for an umpire at a youth baseball game in Newport Beach, California, where a group of heckling parents made an umpire so frustrated he left the field.</p>

      <p>Some of the audio is hard to make out, but the umpire can clearly be heard warning parents to settle down.</p>
      <p>“Enough, I’m not <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2019/11/20/youth-league-umpire-walks-off-field-after-parents-berate-him/40656181/">hearing</a> another word out of any of you. If you want to have a game here, quiet down.”</p>
      <p>It seemed that the game was about to get back on the rails when a parent replied, “stay professional for the kids and just do your job. That’s it.”</p>
      <p>However, any hope that the game might be able to continue evaporated quickly after another member of the crowd took a shot at the umpire’s vertical challenges.</p>
      <p>“Are you mad because the kids are taller than you?”</p>
      <p>And that, more than anything else, appears to be what pushed the ump over the edge. Umpires at youth baseball events get paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 a game.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the ump felt that wasn’t enough to deal with the heckling.</p>
