      <p>PHOENIX — The head of Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication will be the next president of a California university.</p>
      <p>The Cronkite school announced Thursday that Christopher Callahan will be the University of the Pacific’s next president, starting in July 2020.</p>
      <p>Callahan joined ASU in 2005 as the founding dean of the Cronkite school. He serves as the vice provost of ASU’s downtown Phoenix campus and CEO of Arizona PBS.</p>
      <p>He previously held positions at the University of Maryland’s Philip Merrill College of Journalism and was an Associated Press correspondent in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the students, faculty, staff, alumni, board members and supporters of the Cronkite School,” Callahan said Thursday. “Cronkite truly has become the journalism school for the New American University. “The last 15 years have been truly amazing, but I am supremely confident that the next 15 years will be even brighter.”</p>
      <p>ASU says Callahan will live on the Stockton Campus, and will be joined by his wife, who is a human resources executive.</p>
