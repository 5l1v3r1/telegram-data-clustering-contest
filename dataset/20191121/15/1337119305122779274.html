      <h1>WeWork begins laying off 2,400 employees</h1>
      <h2>The latest bad news for the company</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:52:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/colin-lecher" target="_blank">Colin Lecher</a></address>
      <p>WeWork is being hit with layoffs today, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/wework-lays-off-2400-employees.html">according to CNBC</a>, marking the latest downturn in the wake of the company’s disastrous attempted IPO.</p>
      <aside>Layoffs have been rumored for months</aside>
      <p>The outlet reported that WeWork is letting 2,400 employees go. Layoffs at the company have been rumored for months. In September, <i>The Information </i>reported that executives <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/wework-bankers-have-discussed-laying-off-one-third-of-workforce">considered laying off</a> as much as one-third of the company’s workforce, or around 5,000 employees.</p>
      <p>The layoffs are only the latest moment in a precipitous fall for WeWork, which at one point this year, was valued at $50 billion, but it has since become a symbol of corporate mismanagement. Facing questions about its leadership and business plan, WeWork postponed a planned IPO earlier this year, and it has faced intense public scrutiny in the months since.</p>
      <p>Much of the focus has been on former CEO Adam Neumann, whose leadership became a major source of worry for investors. Neumann stepped down in September, receiving <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/28/20932657/wework-blind-survey-layoffs-exit-package-adam-neumann-softbank">a $1.7 billion exit package</a> in the process.</p>
      <p>In October, SoftBank, which is already the largest investor of WeWork, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20928050/softbank-wework-buyout-marcelo-claure">announced</a> that it would buy 80 percent of the struggling company. In an attempt to right the ship, WeWork said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20955870/wework-divesting-non-core-businesses-co-working-wave-pool-company-adam-neumann">earlier this month</a> that it would get rid of its “non-core” businesses, which included a digital marketing platform and wave pool technology business.</p>
      <p>Anticipating layoffs, WeWork employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20955103/wework-coalition-softbank-restructuring-adam-neumann-organizing-letter">announced their intention to unionize</a> this month. “Thousands of us will be laid off in the upcoming weeks,” the employees wrote in a letter to management. “But we want our time here to have meant something.”</p>
