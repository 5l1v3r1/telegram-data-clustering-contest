      <h1>Toddler facing fight of her life after mysterious bruises turn out to be cancer</h1>
      <h2>Emileah Murphy, 3, from Meir in Stoke-on-Trent, is undergoing intensive chemotherapy after being diagnosed with leukaemia when bruises begun appearing in unusual places</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:38:48+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Ault, Lila Randall</a></address>
      <p>A toddler who had mysterious bruises appearing in unusual places has been diagnosed with leukaemia.</p>
      <p>Emileah Murphy, 3, has battled against the blood cancer for the last seven months and despite undergoing intensive chemotherapy she has been “energetic and lively”.</p>
      <p>Mum Holly Murphy said her world was shattered when Emileah started getting the unexplained marks, <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/i-cant-head-around-it-3546497">Stoke-On-Trent</a> Live reports. </p>
      <p>The 32-year-old, who lives in Meir, said: “She was first diagnosed with leukaemia in April.</p>
      <p>“She was covered with bruises, and in random places, not where you would expect a toddler to get bruises. I was quite concerned and that led to the diagnosis of leukaemia.</p>

      <p>“It was a massive shock, I couldn’t get my head around it.</p>
      <p>“But since the start of the treatment, she has coped with it incredibly well. It’s surprising how resilient children are.</p>
      <p>“She’s on chemotherapy. At the start it was quite intense, but now it is in a period of maintenance and she’s able to have more of a normal routine."</p>
      <p>The three-year-old will continue to need treatment until after her fifth birthday before she is given the all-clear.</p>
      <p>Holly added: “When I was first told that Emileah had leukaemia, my first thought was that she would need a bone marrow transplant. But hopefully, after her treatment finishes in two-and-a-half years, that will be it.</p>
      <p>“If the treatment fails, then the next option is stem cells, and a bone marrow transplant is the last resort.”</p>

      <p>Holly broke the news gently to Emileah’s older brother, Kaelan, who is seven, by explaining her illness in a way that he could understand without saying ‘cancer’.</p>
      <p>She said: “Most days, she’s just a normal three-year-old child. She’s brilliant, I am so proud of her.</p>
      <p>"We’ve been trying to keep things as normal as possible for her, and for her brother.</p>
      <p>Now Emileah's family are fundraising for the hospital as she continues her battle.</p>
      <p>Proceeds from the fun day will go to the UHNM Charity, specifically for the oncology ward at the Royal Stoke University Hospital, where Emileah has been treated.</p>
