      <p>Sixteen people discovered in a sealed trailer on board a ferry from France have arrived in Ireland.</p>
      <p>All are reportedly in good health on board the ferry, which docked in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rosslare">Rosslare</a> Europort in Co <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wexford">Wexford</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement earlier, Ian Hampton, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/stena-line-ab">Stena Line</a>'s chief people and communications officer, said an employee discovered the people during a routine inspection.</p>
      <p>He said: "During the Stena Horizon's 9pm sailing from Cherbourg, France, to Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday November 20, one of our employees during a routine inspection discovered 16 people in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck.</p>
      <p>"All the individuals are reported to be in good health and have been moved to a private passenger lounge on the ship where their wellbeing is the focus of our employees.</p>
      <p>"Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel's arrival in Rosslare.</p>
      <p>"The vessel is scheduled to arrive at approximately 3.30pm today."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/an-garda-siochana">Gardai</a> and emergency services met the ferry at the port this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Officers were expected to board the vessel and carry out assessments and searches of the container.</p>
      <p>A source inside the Irish government told the PA news agency that officials in the Justice Department were only made aware of the incident after media reports.</p>
      <p>Opposition party <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fianna-fail">Fianna Fail</a>'s spokesman on justice Jim O'Callaghan expressed his shock and demanded a full investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>"A full investigation must be launched into the discovery of up to 16 people being transported in the back of a lorry to Ireland," he said.</p>
      <p>"Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery and needs to be tackled with fully resourced policing.</p>
      <p>"Recent events show unfortunately Ireland is playing a significant part in this crime. These traffickers have to be thoroughly policed so vulnerable people are protected."</p>
      <p>The incident comes just days after a group of 25 people were found inside a refrigerated container on board a UK-bound ship just off the coast of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Last month, 39 people were found dead inside a container in Essex which had arrived in the UK via a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
