      <p>In an election campaign marked by the strange and dramatic, Lily Allen might just have tipped everybody else to the post with her bizarre reaction to the Labour manifesto.</p>
      <p>The chart-topping songstress, who has been an ardent supporter of the party for years, filmed herself on TikTok bursting into tears over the promises made by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> .</p>
      <p>"Guys I've just watched the Labour manifesto and I think it's the best... manifesto I've ever seen," she gasped, as tears streamed down her face.</p>

      <p>Wearing a black and white stripy jumper, Lily lay back on her sofa as she spoke into the camera.</p>
      <p>She wiped tears from her face with her long-nailed hands, dramatically choking back the sobs that wracked her body.</p>
      <p>However, as TikTok is a video-editing platform, followers suspected she might have used a filter to create the effect of tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>
