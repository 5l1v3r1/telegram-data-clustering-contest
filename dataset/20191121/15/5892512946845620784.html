      <p>The last time I posted a story about Kirill Tereshin, also known as “Russian Popeye,” I got a bunch of Emails explaining how Popeye had big forearms and not big biceps and that I was an idiot for claiming otherwise.</p>
      <p>And while it’s true that I’m an idiot, I don’t work at the International Headquarters For Bodybuilding Nicknames (IHFBN) and have no influence over the Russian media, so I can only work with the material I’m given.</p>
      <p>Tereshin went under the knife last week to have some of the dead tissue — and globs of synthol oil — removed from his massive arms, because you can’t treat your body like the deep fryer at ... (wait for it) ... POPEYES and expect to live a normal, healthy life.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, the 23 year-old Russian was unsuccessful in his mixed martial arts (MMA) debut, getting wasted by aging actor Oleg Mongol earlier this year in Abakan (<a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/22/20926733/video-russian-popeye-tries-mma-gets-destroyed-random-old-guy">watch the video here</a>).</p>
      <p>In other stupid news, health officials have determined that <a href="http://www.mypointless.com/2009/06/headlines-you-can-use.html">pools and diarrhea are not a good mix</a>.</p>
