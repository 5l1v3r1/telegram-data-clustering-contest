      <p>A key impeachment witness teased <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> about taking orders from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a>, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland reportedly made the dig on a phone call to Trump while discussing rapper ASAP Rocky, who was convicted of an assault in Sweden in August.</p>
      <p>State Department Official in Ukraine David Holmes told Thursday’s impeachment hearing: ‘(Sondland) told the president that the rapper was kind of f’ed there and should have pleaded guilty.</p>
      <p>‘(Sondland continued) Let him get sentenced, play the race card, give him a ticker tape when he comes home.</p>
      <p>‘Sweden should have released him on your word but you can tell the Kardashians you tried.’</p>

      <p>The remark is believed to be a reference to reality star Kim Kardashian’s alleged approach to White House special adviser Jared Kushner, who is Trump’s son-in-law.</p>

      <p>Kardashian reportedly wanted to try and get high-level help for the rapper, real name Rakim Athelaston Myers. He spent a month in jail awaiting trial, but was later allowed to return to the US, before being convicted in his absence.</p>
      <p>She visited the White House in May to discuss prison reform, and raised the case of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63 year-old grandma jailed for life for drug offenses.</p>
      <p>President Trump commuted Johnson’s sentence shortly after that meeting. The reality star-turned president has long been accused of being dazzled by other celebrities, and is currently enjoying an ongoing love-in with Kardashian’s husband, rapper Kanye West.</p>
      <p>Holmes also recalled Sondland telling him Trump ‘was in a bad mood, which was often the case first thing in the morning.’</p>

      <p>He claims to have heard Trump’s ‘loud and recognizable’ voice on the other side of the line. Trump was reportedly heard asking about his alleged demand that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate his political rival Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Holmes explained: ‘I then heard President Trump ask “So, he’s gonna do the investigation?”</p>
      <p>‘Ambassador Sondland replied that “He’s gonna do it,” adding that “President Zelensky will do “anything you ask him to.”‘</p>
      <p>Holmes said Sondland agreed with him that ‘the president did not give an expletive about Ukraine.’</p>

      <p>He alleges that Sondland told him the president only cares about ‘big stuff that benefits the president, like the Biden investigation.’</p>

      <p>Trump is accused of abusing his office for personal gain by asking Zelensky to probe Biden’s son Hunter’s appointment to the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma.</p>
      <p>He is also said to have pushed for a probe into Ukrainian meddling into the 2016 presidential election, which Trump won.</p>
      <p>Trump is said to have made the demands in July, long after the Ukrainian meddling theory was widely debunked.</p>
      <p>He is accused of dangling a coveted invite to the White House in return for the investigation.</p>
      <p>The US also put a hold on $400million security aid to Ukraine to combat Russian aggression around the same time.</p>
      <p>Trump has faced allegations that he ordered the hold until his requests were answered.</p>
      <p>Gordon Sondland told the hearing yesterday that he took orders from Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who told them he was acting on behalf of ‘the boss’ – Trump.</p>
      <p>Democrats claim these demands prove quid pro quo – a favor for a favor – that constitute an abuse of Trump’s office.</p>
      <p>Trump denies any wrongdoing, and has branded the hearing a ‘witch hunt.’</p>
      <p>He also took to Twitter to refute Holmes’ phone call claims on Thursday, writing: ‘I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life.</p>
      <p>‘My hearing is, and has been, great. Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve even tried, but to no avail. Try it live!’</p>
