        <i>Royal had said he was stepping down from public duties amid Jeffrey Epstein row</i>
      </p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace has risked reigniting the controversy surrounding Prince Andrew by announcing he will continue his work with a business mentoring initiative, a day after he said he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/prince-andrew-to-step-back-from-public-duties-for-foreseeable-future">stepping down from public duties</a>.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York will continue to be involved with Pitch@Palace, which has held events at Buckingham and St James’s palaces, “but will look at how he takes this forward outside of his public duties, and outside of the palace”, a statement said.</p>
      <p>“Naturally there will be a transition period while this takes place,” Buckingham Palace said.</p>
      <p>The decision to retain Prince Andrew’s links to the initiative, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/19/prince-andrew-student-body-calls-for-royal-to-step-down-huddersfield-university-as-chancellor">corporate partners such as BT have </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/19/prince-andrew-student-body-calls-for-royal-to-step-down-huddersfield-university-as-chancellor">abandoned</a> in recent days, raised concerns that it muddied the waters of what had appeared to be a clean break from royal duties.</p>
      <p>Sources at one backer of the prince’s initiatives with the business community called for clarity. “To put it bluntly, this situation can’t last – the in-out-in-out hokey-cokey can’t last. So I would like to see some clarity on [his continuing involvement].”</p>
      <p>The decision signals a desire on the part of the palace to protect what was seen by some as a successful scheme. At least one backer had suggested to the Guardian that Andrew could make way for another royal, such as Prince Harry or William.</p>
      <p>A spotlight also fell on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-andrew">Prince Andrew</a> Charitable Trust, which holds a controlling stake in the Pitch@Palace initiative. Charity Commission filings show the trust spent approximately £40,000 on charitable activities and £1.24m on raising funds in the 2017-18 financial year. Andrew is not listed as a trustee on the four-person board, which includes his private secretary, Amanda Thirsk.</p>
      <p>Graham Smith, the chief executive of the campaign group Republic, said: “It’s not a surprise, given that royal charities we have looked into have similar patterns of minimal spending on charitable activities and quite a lot on fundraising, but it does appear to be a vanity project for Prince Andrew and a way giving him something to do. The trust is obliged to take independent decisions, irrespective of whether it has his name on it.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/DrDomWillmott/status/1197520635049721857/photo/1">Huddersfield University</a> announced on Thursday that the prince had stood down as chancellor after a student panel called for his resignation. On Thursday night, the students’ union at London Metropolitan University said they would be lobbying for his removal as its patron.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday in his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/prince-andrew-to-step-back-from-public-duties-for-foreseeable-future">statement</a> saying he was standing down from public duties, the prince said he was willing to help “any appropriate law enforcement agency” with their investigations after what he accepted was his “ill-judged association” with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing five of Epstein’s victims, demanded further action by the prince. In a tweet she called on him and his staff to appear for civil depositions and produce all relevant documents about his contact with Epstein.</p>

      <p>Later, when asked by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether she would approach Prince Andrew to serve him with a subpoena to provide a legal statement about his time with Epstein, Bloom replied: “We may as part of our investigation.”</p>
      <p>She added: “It may be difficult to serve a deposition subpoena on him. But we believe that nobody is above the law, and that everybody should have to answer questions, if they have relevant information, and he clearly does have relevant information.</p>

      <p>It is understood there have been discussions within the royal family about the situation, with Prince Andrew talking to the Queen and the Prince of Wales.</p>
      <p>Andrew met the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday before his decision to step down was announced.</p>
