      <p>Thom Evans dodged questions about his reported romance with Nicole Scherzinger on today's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, it was claimed <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-x-factor-celebrity-star-thom-evans/">the pair had enjoyed a romantic evening with each other</a> in London with a source saying <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">X Factor: Celebrity</a> Thom was "smitten early on".</p>
      <p>The rugby player was grilled on the rumours on today's Loose Women and he remained very coy.</p>

      </p>
      <p>While discussing the talent show, Jane Moore asked: "Thom I've been reading the papers and there's been a little bit of extra frisk on with you... Nicole."</p>
      <p>His bandmates Ben Foden and Levi Davis waved their hands and said: "Ooooh."</p>
      <aside>I mean who wouldn't want to date Nicole, she's lovely.</aside>
      <p>Thom said: "Look Nicole is lovely and I... uh... I've been focusing on the programme and the finals."</p>
      <p>Rubbing Thom's shoulder, stand-in host Rochelle Humes said: "Really good job there," as the panel and audience laughed.</p>
      <p>Jane asked: "What about after the finals when it's all done?"</p>

      <p>Levi joked: "Then we'll be focusing on the music industry," as Thom said: " Yeah. I mean who wouldn't want to date Nicole, she's lovely..."</p>
      <p>Ben cut in: "Who wouldn't to date Thom, he's lovely," to which Thom joked: "I actually paid Ben to say that."</p>
      <p>It comes after an insider spilled details of Thom and Nicole's reported romance.</p>
      <p>The insider told <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4962965/nicole-scherzinger-thom-evans-scotland-x-factor-celebrity/">The Sun</a>: "Thom is completely Nicole’s type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on - he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world.</p>
      <p>"He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up, and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.</p>

      <p>"And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner."</p>
      <p>The source also claimed they met up with friends and were laughing and joking throughout the evening.</p>
      <p>However, the pair apparently want to both focus on the series for now and then "see what may or may not progress once the show has wrapped".</p>
      <p>Thom has previously dated Kelly Brook and 90210 actress Jessica Lowndes.</p>
      <p>He recently <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/x-factor-celebrity-hunk-thom-evans-reveals-hes-on-a-sex-ban/">revealed that he's on a sex ban because he doesn't want any distractions</a> while performing on X Factor: Celebrity.</p>
