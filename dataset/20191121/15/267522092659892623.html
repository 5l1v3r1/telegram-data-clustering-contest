      <h2>After a last-minute cruise deal? You'll want to head this way</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:25:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author">Spencer Hart</a></address>
      <p>Looking for a great cruise deal? You've come to the right place. We've rounded up some of the best cruise deals you'll find online, whether you're looking for a festive winter getaway or a sizzling summer holiday.</p>
      <p>It's important to remember cruise ships lose money on empty rooms, so most major cruise operators will offer reduced prices on last-minute bookings. That's great if you can be flexible with your days, however, most cruise operators will also offer incentives for booking well in advance, so, if you're not able to be flexible with dates (due to pesky school term times) you can still pick up a great deal.</p>

      <h3>Black Friday Cruise Deals: what deals to expect</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-uk-deals-update-nov-20">Black Friday 2019</a> is fast approaching. This is the day when retailers everywhere slash their prices so you can get your hands on some cracking deals, but they’re not the only ones slashing their prices. Cruise lines all do the same, meaning in the lead up to Black Friday, you’ll be able to bag yourself a bargain cruise, and we’re going to show you how. </p>
      <p>A cheap cruise can be all too tempting, but there’s a difference between good value and good price. Remember to consider the price of things like flights and other travel extras before rushing into a seemingly “good” deal. </p>
      <p>If you’re looking for some winter sun, then you’ll be in luck, as we’re likely to see plenty of last-minute deals for the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, early-birds really do catch the worm, and Black Friday is the perfect time to book your 2020/21 summer holiday so you can avoid the inevitably extortionate school holiday prices. Destinations we’re likely to see on the list include the Carribean, Meddeterian, Indonesia, Australia, as well as cooler places, such as Norway and Northern Europe.</p>
      <p>We recommend starting early. Bookmark this page and pick out the destinations or packages you’re interested in. This means that when the time comes, you can work quickly. The best Black Friday cruise deals won’t be around for long, so doing some prep will help you find what you’re looking for. </p>
      <p>Check back here, as we’ll be covering all of the best deals over <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-uk-deals-update-nov-20">Black Friday weekend</a>. We’ve got a few weeks to go yet, but here are a few to keep your eye on in the lead up to Black Friday 2019…</p>
      <h3>Cruise deals: when to get best cruise deals</h3>
      <p>There are two trains of thought when it comes to getting the best cruise deals, you can either book a long time in advance and get the incentives that come with it, or leave booking to the last minute and possibly pick up some more affordable prices.</p>
      <p>Generally, cruises can be booked anywhere from 18 months in advance to one week ahead of sailing. There are pros and cons to choosing either of these methods, so it’s important to know what you’re in for.</p>
      <p>Booking far in advance gives you more choice when it comes to cabin selection. You’ll also likely receive some extra ‘perks’ as cruise operators incentivise booking early. These perks could include prepaid gratuities, free meals, free drinks, or spending money.</p>
      <p>The later you leave it, the less choice you’ll have when it comes to booking cabins, but you are more likely to save money. There are exceptions, however, and you shouldn’t expect to save money on sailings during school holidays, or during your destination’s high season.</p>
      <p>You shouldn’t always expect massive savings when it comes to booking last minute. After all, if <i>all </i>cruises were half-price the week before sailing, <i>all</i> passengers would wait until the last minute before booking.</p>
      <p>Instead of booking super-early or super-late, we’d suggest checking out all the deals below. If you find a cruise you want, at a price you’re happy with, book it.</p>
      <h3>Cruise deals: how to save money on your cruise</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Short cruises are great value for money, with many cruise companies, including Royal Caribbean and P&amp;O, offer ‘taster cruises’. These usually go to France or Holland.</li>
        <li>Repositioning cruises take place in spring and autumn, with a number of ships following the sun around the globe. Between September and November, a large number of ship cross from Britain to the United States and the Caribbean, stopping at Iceland and Canada on the way. In spring, these ships head back to the UK via the Azores, Canary Islands and the Iberian Peninsula.</li>
        <li>One-way voyages are often more affordable than return journeys.</li>
        <li>Out-of-season sailings often benefit from quieter ports, cafes, restaurants, and tourist attractions when you disembark.</li>
        <li>You can often get lower prices if you’re booking for a large group of people.</li>
        <li>Generally, older ships are more affordable.</li>
        <li>If you’re not planning on spending much time in your room, then book an internal stateroom. You won’t have an ocean view, but if you’re only sleeping in your room that doesn’t really matter.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cruise deals: how to find the best cruise deals</h3>
      <p>It goes without saying (but we’ll say it anyway) that the best way to get a great deal on a cruise is to travel out-of-season. That means avoiding the school holidays at all costs. Some cruise lines (such as <a href="https://www.msccruises.co.uk/cruise-deals">MSC cruises</a>) have ships in the Mediterranean all winter, which means there are always some good deals to be had on these out-of-season sailings. Similarly, in Northern Europe, cruises at the start and end of the summer season will be well priced.</p>
      <p>Cruise lines such as <a href="https://www.pocruises.com/deals">P&amp;O Cruises</a> and <a href="https://www.cunard.com/en-gb/cruise-deals">Cunard</a> have sales all year round. While these companies don’t exactly fall into the budget category, they’re well worth snapping up if you’re after a slightly more luxurious cruise and are flexible on sailing dates.</p>
      <p>P&amp;O Cruises usually have an <a href="https://www.pocruises.com/deals">excellent selection of last-minute deals</a> for the bargain hunters, as well as early-saver fares for those looking more ahead. These are often available in-season, during school holidays, so they’re well worth checking out, especially if you’re after a cut-price cruise to Europe or the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>Italian-themed <a href="https://www.msccruises.co.uk/cruise-deals">MSC Cruises</a> offer a range of deals for cruisers, including Deals of the Week and Last Minute breaks. These are a selection of fly-cruises at excellent prices. Likewise, <a href="https://book.princess.com/html/global/cruisedeals/uk/top-deals/">Princess Cruises also offer an excellent range</a> of Worldwide Fly-Cruises and European roundtrips at discount prices.</p>
      <p>If you want to book an entire cruise holiday, it's worth looking at <a href="https://www.virginholidayscruises.co.uk/cruise-deals">Virgin Holidays</a> or <a href="https://www.tui.co.uk/cruise/deals">TUI</a>. These companies usually offer deals which include flights, hotels and the cruise, meaning your entire holiday is sorted with a single payment.</p>
