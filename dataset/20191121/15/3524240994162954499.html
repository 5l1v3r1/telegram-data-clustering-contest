      <p>Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday, stepped down proceedings in the continuation of trial of Abdulrasheed Maina, Chairman, defunct Pension Reform Task Team, citing the accused’s “failing health.”</p>
      <p>Justice Abang, who made the remark, said the order was to allow Maina, who was in court, to take his medication.</p>
      <p>The development began a few minutes after the commencement of the proceeding.</p>
      <p><i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> observed that when the matter was called, Maina, who was sitting with families and officers of the Nigerian Correctional Services, was assisted up by two of the officers, so as to be taken to the dock by his counsel, Francis Oronsaye,</p>
      <p>However, the judge ordered that he should be left to sit where he was.</p>
      <p>When the proceeding started, Oronsaye drew the attention of the judge to Maina’s “deteriorating health condition.”</p>
      <p>“My Lord, my client is bleeding and I will seek your indulgence to allow him take his medication,” he said.</p>
      <p>Justice Abang, therefore, granted the request and stepped down for 20 minutes.</p>
