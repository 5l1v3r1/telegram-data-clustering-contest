      <h1>Star Wars: JJ Abrams Addresses Rey Being More Adept Than Luke Skywalker</h1>

      <p>One of the more vocal observations from the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/"><i>Star Wars</i></a> fanbase is that Rey appears to be mastering her control of the Force much faster than her mentor Luke <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-rise-skywalker-luke-role-force-ghost/">Skywalker</a> did in the original trilogy.</p>
      <p>According to filmmaker J.J. Abrams, who introduced Rey to the franchise in 2015's <i>The Force Awakens</i> and is poised to continue her story in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/"><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>, Rey's instant aptitude in wielding the Force is no accident, with the director hinting it may come into play in the upcoming sequel.</p>

      <p>In <i>The Force Awakens</i>, Rey was able to perform a Jedi mind trick on a hapless Stormtrooper, pilot vessels she had never flown before with natural ease and Force pull a lightsaber to her before defeating Kylo Ren in an epic duel. All this was accomplished before briefly training under Luke in <i>The Last Jedi</i>, with the venerable Jedi Master detecting immense potential in her before she departed to face the First Order. Luke, meanwhile, had trained under two different Jedi Masters for a longer period of time to reach the potential of his future protege.</p>
