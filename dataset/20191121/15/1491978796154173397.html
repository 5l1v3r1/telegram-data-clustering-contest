        <i>Serbian authorities are investigating a video that purportedly shows a Russian spy handing over a bag of cash to an unnamed Serbian official. The video, uploaded anonymously to YouTube on Wednesday, later shows the Serbian man counting money from inside the bag while sitting in his car. Serbian officials confirmed the video was genuine and identified the agent as Georgy Kleban.</i>
