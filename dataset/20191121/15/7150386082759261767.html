      <p>Dream11 Team India Under-19 vs Afghanistan Under-19 Prediction Youth ODI Series – Cricket Tips For Today’s 1st ODI Match IN-Y vs AF-Y at Lucknow: In the first match of the five-game Youth ODI series, India Under-19 team will host Afghanistan Under-19 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium B ground, Lucknow on Friday. While the senior Afghans will take on Windies in the one-off Test match at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow, their Under-19 side will be up against Indian team at the ‘B’ ground. The Afghan team will be led by Farhan Zakhil while Priyam Garg takes the responsibility of the home team.</p>
      <p>The current crop of players in the Afghanistan U19s team were part of the Youth Asia Cup in Sri Lanka earlier this year. They qualified for the semi-final by defeating Pakistan but an abandoned semi-final eliminated them. The Indian team players, on the other hand, are fresh of featuring in the Under-19s Challenger Trophy.</p>
