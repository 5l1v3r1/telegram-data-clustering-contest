      <p>It’s just one of a number of recent announcements involving the ability to use streaming services on new platforms.</p>

      <p>Here’s a brief roundup.</p>
      <p>First of all, <b>Spotify</b> has announced its free service is now available on for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alexa devices</li>
        <li>Bose wireless speakers</li>
        <li>Sonos wireless speakers (including the <a href="https://fave.co/37q4N5V">IKEA SYMFONISK WiFi speaker</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Previously you needed to pay for a $10 per month or more for a Spotify subscription if you wanted to listen on any of those devices.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile in related-possibly-only-in-my-mind news, streaming live TV platform <b>Sling TV</b> has announced that it’s now available on <a href="https://whatson.sling.com/announcements/nest-hub-nest-hub-max/">two additional devices</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Nest Hub smart display</li>
        <li>Google Nest Hub Max smart display</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Interestingly, Sling TV also supports Facebook’s Portal smart displays, but it does not work with the Amazon Echo Show line of devices or other Google Assistant-powered screens such as the Lenovo Smart Display line of devices.</p>
      <p>But the services does support a <a href="https://www.sling.com/supported-devices">pretty broad range of other platforms</a> including Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Samsung and LG smart TVs, and Oculus headsets as well as phones, computers, and game consoles.</p>
