      <h1>Black Friday SSD deals 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:28:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/phil-savage/" target="_blank">Phil Savage</a></address>
      <p>Want to boot up your PC in seconds rather than minutes? Black Friday is a great time to grab a deal on an SSD. While SSD prices have dropped significantly over the last few years, taking advantage of one of the many <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> due to run through November and December is the perfect way to get some extra storage for your games. You'll immediately notice faster load times, making even the biggest games that much quicker to play.</p>
      <p>Although there's likely to be plenty of modest deals on smaller drives, Black Friday is a great time to secure big savings on larger storage devices—such as an SSD <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-system-requirements/">big enough to hold Red Dead Redemption 2</a> or <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/modern-warfare-system-requirements/">Modern Warfare</a>—or on more expensive SSD options like an NVMe M.2 drive. As noted in our guide to the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-ssd-for-gaming/">best SSDs for gaming</a>, NVMe drives are by far the fastest option when it comes to read/write speeds, but, outside of sales periods like Black Friday, aren't as cost-efficient as SATA drives.</p>

      <h3>Best SSD deals right now</h3>

      <p>While Black Friday itself isn't until November 29, you can expect the deals to arrive well before then. Previously we've seen sales start about two weeks in advance, so you should start checking any SSDs you want to buy in the sale from around November 15 onwards. As for <i>when</i> you should snap up that deal, that's not quite as obvious. Most retailers will save their best deals for Black Friday itself, but there's no guarantee that your chosen SSD will be included, or that it will still be in stock. If you're looking for the absolute best deal, it pays to be flexible—waiting for November 29 and snagging one of the headline SSD deals. But if the drive you're sure you want has a decent discount anytime in late-November, it's worth getting it then and there.</p>
      <p>Beyond Black Friday, the deals won't stop. Cyber Monday will kick off on December 2, and the deals from that date will likely for until the week after, probably around December 9. From there, the deals could run into Christmas itself.</p>
      <h3>How to save money on SSDs during Black Friday</h3>

      <p>You can expect to see a lot of price cuts this November, so how can you be sure you're actually getting a good Black Friday deal? While we'll be searching out the best possible deals during the event itself, there are also a handful of common sense tips that will help make the process feel less overwhelming.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Check the price history</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every retailer will be touting its massive price cuts, but are those discounts as good as advertised? Sites like CamelCamelCamel can help you check. As well as letting you easily compare the price of a selected drive across many different sites, it also gives you access to its price history. A common trick is to display massive discounts based on the manufacturer recommended price—a price that drive may not have actually been sold at for years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Do the research</b>
      </p>
      <p>Does your motherboard have an M.2 slot? Will your most played games all fit onto a 1TB SSD? How much are you willing to spend on extra storage? It's worth taking some time to find out what you need or want, and what drives would help you achieve that. Some flexibility will help you get the best deal, but it's also worth setting a budget to ensure that you're not spending slightly more on a good deal for a drive you don't actually need.</p>
