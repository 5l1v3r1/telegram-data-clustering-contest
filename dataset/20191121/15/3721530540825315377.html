      <p>Janelle Monáe stars in upcoming horror movie <i>Antebellum</i>, but outside of the directors and release date, not much else is known about this super secret project. It doesn’t even have a Wikipedia or IMDB page.</p>
      <p>What we do know: Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz wrote and directed the film, which was announced back in March. Other details have been kept under wraps, however, though the duo is known for highlighting social issues in their work. Bush and Renz previously worked on campaign with the MLK Memorial Foundation and Amnesty International, as well as a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F186282598&amp;referrer=polygon.com">viral PSA about police brutality</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQLVU4j7Ejo">politically charged Jay-Z music video.</a></p>
      <p>The first trailer for <i>Antebellum</i> is tinged with Southern Gothic influences, seemingly taking place in two time periods: the present day and the titular pre-American Civil War period. Something is chasing present-day Janelle Monáe. There’s also a creepy little girl in a white dress, who is definitely not a force for good.</p>
      <p>The posters for <i>Antebellum </i>feature a single monarch butterfly with bloody wings. Creepy!</p>
