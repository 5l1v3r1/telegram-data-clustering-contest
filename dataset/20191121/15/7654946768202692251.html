      <h1>Nearly 700,000 Jeep, Dodge SUVs recalled over electrical issues</h1>

      <p>Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is recalling nearly 700,000 SUVs because of electrical faults that can affect engine startups.</p>
      <p>The fuel pump relay problems in certain Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango models from 2011 to 2013 can interrupt electrical current, preventing engines from starting or contributing to stalls, the automaker said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The company says it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the faults.</p>
      <p>The recall includes more than 528,000 vehicles in the US, along with 116,511 outside North America, 34,764 in Canada and 18,152 in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Relays in the faulty SUVs “may have been installed in response to a previous recall,” Fiat Chrysler said in a statement. Most of the same vehicles were recalled for fuel pump relay problems in 2014 and 2015, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiat-chrysler-recall/fiat-chrysler-to-recall-nearly-700000-suvs-for-electrical-fault-risk-idUSKBN1XV120">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Fiat Chrysler — which plans to merge with French automaker PSA — will tell affected drivers when they can schedule free repairs, the company said.</p>
      <p>The recall came a day after General Motors <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/gm-accuses-rival-fiat-chrysler-of-bribe-scheme-in-lawsuit/">accused Fiat Chrysler in a lawsuit</a> of corrupting labor negotiations with a long-running bribery scheme. Fiat Chrysler called GM’s claims “nothing more than a meritless attempt to divert attention from that company’s own challenges.”</p>
