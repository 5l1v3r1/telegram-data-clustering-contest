      <h3>Wildlife Photographer Of The Year</h3>
      <p>A photo of a Tibetan fox surprising a Himalayan marmot by Yongqing Bao has claimed the title of year’s best wildlife photo. The Chinese photographer’s The Moment is among 100 images featured in the annual Wildlife Photographer Of The Year show, which opens at the ROM this weekend. The work of three Canadians is also featured, including Saskatoon-based Jason Bantle’s Lucky Break, which shows a raccoon poking her head through the windshield of the abandoned 70s Ford Pinto she calls home. The pic received a “highly commended” mention from the jury in the Urban Wildlife category. Another highlight is 13-year-old Cruz Erdmann’s shot of a bigfin reef squid off the coast of Indonesia. The photos fall into eight categories plus the Grand Title winners.</p>
