      <h1>Most shocking royal scandals as Prince Andrew steps down - from toe sucking to nudity</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein has dominated headlines this week, but there have been a number of shocking scandals in the Royal Family over the years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:46:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein has been labelled one of the biggest humiliations in the Royal Family's history.</p>
      <p>Experts believe that his actions, including the "car crash" interview in which he described the convicted sex offenders behaviour as "unbecoming" and failed to show any sympathy towards the victims, will take years of rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>But this is far from the first scandal to rock the Firm, and there have been many controversial and downright embarrassing moments over the years.</p>
      <p>From the toe sucking photo that drove Sarah Ferguson out of the family for good, to Prince Charles and Princess Diana's numerous affairs, we've had a look at look back through some of the most shocking.</p>

      <h3>Fergie's toe sucking</h3>
      <p>The Duke and  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sarah-ferguson">Duchess of York</a>  tied the knot in 1986 - but just six years later their marriage ended in scandal.</p>
      <p>Ferguson, more commonly known as "Fergie", and Prince Andrew announced their separation in March 1992.</p>
      <p>Five months later, the Duchess was embroiled in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/toe-sucking-photo-drove-sarah-13384631">arguably the Royal family's biggest ever scandal</a> when compromising photographs with her 'financial advisor', taken at her holiday villa in St Tropez, were published in the Daily Mirror.</p>
      <p>The intimate pictures show Texan millionaire John Bryan kissing and sucking the Duchess' toes and the arch of her foot.</p>
      <p>They also showed the couple kissing and embracing, and frolicking in the pool.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>In one image, two-year-old  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/princess-eugenie">Princess Eugenie</a>  watched on as Mr Bryan kissed her mother on the lips.</p>
      <p>Never before had a Royal been seen in this light.</p>
      <p>On the morning the photographs were published, Sarah Ferguson was staying at Balmoral with the rest of the royal family.</p>
      <p>Royal writer Richard Kay claimed in the Daily Mail that he received a message via pager from Princess Diana the night before the photos hit the newspaper stands.</p>
      <p>Diana's message was simple: "The redhead's in trouble."</p>
      <p>He then got a call from John Bryan asking if he could obtain an early copy of the Mirror so he could see what was being said.</p>
      <p>Kay obliged, rushing to Bryan's flat just as he received a call from a concerned Sarah Ferguson.</p>
      <p>"Bryan promised her everything would be fine, but I could see in his face that he didn’t really believe it," Kay wrote.</p>
      <p>"In a few short hours, those pictures were going to be on the breakfast room sideboard in the Queen’s castle. They would also be winging around the world to be pored over by millions."</p>
      <h3>Prince Harry's Nazi costume</h3>
      <p>In 2005 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> left people outraged when he dressed up as a Nazi for his friend's fancy dress birthday party.</p>
      <p>He was heavily criticised by politicians, religious leaders and charities after the photos were leaked.</p>
      <p>Pictures on the front page of the Sun under the headline Harry the Nazi showed the royal in a shirt with an eagle insignia on the front and a Swastika armband.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It was claimed it was the uniform of Rommel's Afrika Korps.</p>
      <p>He was holding a drink and a cigarette in the shot.</p>
      <p>The Prince was third in line to the throne at the time, and Clarence House quickly issued a statement saying he was sorry if he had caused any offence.</p>
      <p>The scandal came just two weeks before the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.</p>
      <h3>Princess Diana's Panorama interview</h3>
      <p>The Princess of Wales dropped a number of bombshells about her relationship with Prince Charles and life in the Royal Family during her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/princess-diana-gave-emotional-interview-20704533">interview with the BBC's Martin Bashir in 1995</a> .</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace had no idea about her interview and shortly after it aired the Queen wrote to both Diana and Charles advising them to get a divorce.</p>
      <p>She spoke for the first time of Charles's affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles, and one of the most famous quotes from the interview became: "Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."</p>
      <p>During the interview she also admitted she had cheated, and when asked if she had been unfaithful with James Hewitt replied: "Yes, I adored him. Yes, I was in love with him. But I was very let down."</p>
      <p>She also spoke about her bulimia, saying: "That's like a secret disease.</p>
      <p>"You inflict it upon yourself because your self-esteem is at a low ebb, and you don't think you're worthy or valuable. You fill your stomach up four or five times a day - some do it more - and it gives you a feeling of comfort.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"It's like having a pair of arms around you, but it's temporarily, temporary. Then you're disgusted at the bloatedness of your stomach, and then you bring it all up again.</p>
      <p>"And it's a repetitive pattern which is very destructive to yourself."</p>
      <h3>Prince Charles admits adultery</h3>
      <p>Even though Diana spoke about Charles and Camilla's relationship, Charles didn't admit to adultery until years later.</p>
      <p>He was asked outright if he had been "faithful and honourable" during his marriage.</p>
      <p>He replied: "Yes, absolutely."</p>
      <p>Jonathan Dimbleby then follows up with "And you were?", to which the prince said: "Yes, until it became irretrievably broken down, us both having tried."</p>

      <h3>Prince Harry in Las Vegas</h3>
      <p>The Duke of Sussex said "I let myself down, I let my family down" after being pictured frolicking  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry-naked-pictures">naked in Las Vegas</a> in 2012.</p>
      <p>The Royal spoke openly of his remorse over his wild partying, and revealed he struggles to balance his position as third-in-line to the throne while trying to have a “normal” army and social life.</p>
      <p>Pictures showed Harry cupping his privates next to an unnamed naked woman and exposing his bottom during an August trip to Sin City, when he stayed at the £5,000-per-night Wynn Hotel.</p>
      <p>British-born Carrie Reichert, then 32, ­revealed she spent 20 minutes alone with the prince in his hotel bedroom.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She was handpicked with nine other girls to join Harry in his penthouse suite but soon the royal heart-throb led her away so they could be together.</p>
      <p>Carrie said: “We kissed, he was naked at the time, and pretty open. It was a drunken fumble. It wasn’t romantic, just fun.</p>
      <p>“He was a gentleman, but he was so wasted. The alcohol affected him. I was there for 15 to 20 minutes.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-harry-admits-shame-over-1548284">Addressing the trip a year later,</a> he said:  "At the end of the day I probably let myself down, I let my family down, I let other people down.</p>
      <p>"But it was probably a classic example of me probably being too much army, and not enough prince. It’s a simple case of that."</p>
      <h3>King Edward VIII marrying a divorcee and giving up the throne</h3>
      <p>The Queen's uncle shocked the world in 1936 when he announced he would be giving up the throne in order to marry American actress Wallis Simpson.</p>
      <p>They were not allowed to marry in the Church of England as she had already been divorced twice before.</p>
      <p>But he was head over heels in love, so Edward followed his heart and abdicated so he could make Ms Simpson his wife.</p>
      <p>They moved to Paris after being 'banished' from the country and tied the knot in 1937.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Making the announcement on the radio, he said: "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King [...] without the help and support of the woman I love."</p>
      <p>He added that the "decision was mine and mine alone ... The other person most nearly concerned has tried up to the last to persuade me to take a different course".</p>
      <p>The decision sparked a constitutional crisis and forever changed the line of succession to the throne, with the Queen's father, George VI, becoming the new heir.</p>
      <p>Relations between Edward and the rest of the Royal Family became strained for decades and there were also rows over his allowance from the Crown.</p>
      <p>His abdication changed the line of succession forever and is the reason the Queen is our monarch today.</p>
      <h3>Princess Margaret's relationship with Peter Townsend</h3>
      <p>In what would become the biggest scandal since her uncle's abdication, Princess Margaret fell in love with RAF Group Captain Peter Townsend.</p>
      <p>He was equerry to her father King George VI and then to the Queen.</p>
      <p>It first came to light at the Queen's coronation when the new Monarch's younger sister was seen picking a piece of fluff Townsend's uniform.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>In 1952 he divorced his wife, with who he had two children, on the grounds of her adultery and subsequently proposed to Margaret.</p>
      <p>However the Queen had to give her permission under the Royal Marriages Act of 1772, and she refused after pressure from Winston Churchill and the Church of England as he was a divorcee.</p>
      <p>Margaret and Peter waited two years until she turned 25, which meant she was allowed to ask Parliament herself to override the decision.</p>
      <p>By this time Anthony Eden was in charge, who had been divorced and remarried himself, and he agreed to amend the act so the Queen's permission wasn't needed.</p>
      <p>But three days after the final draft was produced Margaret announced she wouldn't be marrying Townsend after all.</p>
      <p>Mystery surrounded her decision, but a letter she wrote to Eden read: "It is only by seeing him in this way that I feel I can properly decide whether I can marry him or not."</p>
