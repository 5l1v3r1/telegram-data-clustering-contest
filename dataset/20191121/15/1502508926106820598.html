      <h1>Thyssenkrupp ploughs deeper into red in 2018-19; operating profit drops 71%</h1>
      <h2>"The performance of many of our businesses is not satisfying," chief executive Martina Merz said in a statement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:35:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">AFP/PTI</a></address>
      <p>Troubled German industrial conglomerate <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/thyssenkrupp">Thyssenkrupp </a>on Thursday reported it ground deeper into the red in its 2018-19 fiscal year, with more pain ahead from a hefty restructuring plan.</p>
      <p>The group, a sprawling behemoth that makes products from raw steel to submarines, elevators and car parts, booked a net loss of 304 million euros ($337 million) in the year to September.</p>
      <p>That loss was five times worse than in its previous fiscal year.</p>
      <p>Operating, or underlying profit fell 71 per cent, to 272 million euros, although revenues grew one percent to almost 42 billion -- making for an operating margin of just 0.6 per cent.</p>
      <p>"The performance of many of our businesses is not satisfying," chief executive Martina Merz said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"This is also due to the fact that necessary structural improvements and restructuring measures were not implemented with the necessary consequence. We will now tackle this," she added.</p>
      <p>Merz, former head of the supervisory board, stepped in as CEO in September after a round of musical chairs at the top of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/thyssenkrupp">Thyssenkrupp </a>prompted by its business woes.</p>
      <p>Predecessor Guido Kerkhoff stepped down after just 14 months on the job, having himself replaced a chief -- Heinrich Hiesinger -- who was driven out largely by pressure from activist investors.</p>
      <p>Kerkhoff's grand plan for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/thyssenkrupp">Thyssenkrupp </a>had been to split the company into two halves -- "Materials" and "Industrials".</p>
      <p>But European Commission competition watchdogs threw a spanner into the works by forbidding a merger of its steelmaking arm with Indian company Tata.</p>
      <p>Some 6,000 of Thyssenkrupp's 160,000 jobs are now set to go, while the company's crown jewel -- its highly profitable elevators division -- is slated either for sale or a stock market flotation, with a decision expected in "the first quarter of 2020".</p>
      <p>The group offered little detail on its plans for the steel unit beyond saying executives are "currently working on a concept" whose "aim is to give steel a long-term perspective", set to be presented next month.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Thyssenkrupp said its industrial plant building division could invite new investors aboard or be hived off entirely.</p>
      <p>Given the group's losses, executives plan not to pay shareholders a dividend for 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Thyssenkrupp said it was "generally cautious" about 2019-20, warning that "economic and geopolitical uncertainties" threatened especially "cyclical" businesses like materials and car components.</p>
      <p>Adjusted operating profit should come in around the same level as the 802 million euros booked in 2018-19, but the group forecasts a "significantly higher net loss" based especially on "expenses for the intensification of restructuring".</p>
