      <p>It's no secret the BC forest industry has fallen on hard times.</p>
      <p>There are numerous reports of layoffs, closures and cutbacks, except at one plant in Spallumcheen.</p>
      <p>Woodtone is not only keeping its employees working, it is hiring more staff.</p>
      <p>Some 70 people are employed by the plant that has carved out a successful niche market while taking value added to a whole new level.</p>
      <p>The company takes small pieces of wood that were destined for the chipper or burner from area sawmills and turns them into large, valuable pieces of wood coveted for a variety of construction projects.</p>
      <p>“We partner with a lot of the primary mills around the Okanagan particularly, and we buy a lot of the lengths and odds and ends they can't get rid of,” said Chad Richmond, Woodtone territory manager and product manager.</p>
      <p>Those shorter pieces of wood are then milled and finger jointed to make dimensional lumber.</p>
      <p>The final product undergoes rigorous testing to ensure each piece of joined wood is a solid piece of lumber.</p>
      <p>Most of the products head to the United States market.</p>
      <p>“That's our largest consumer base for this product line,” said Richmond, adding while some markets in the United States are in a bit of a slump, Woodtone has carved out a solid niche market and sales remain strong. “We are able to fill a void in the marketplace right now.”</p>
      <p>And while forestry giants like Tolko announce cutbacks and closures, Woodtone is expanding its unionized workforce.</p>
      <p>“We are bringing back our nightshift sooner rather than later than we normally would have. We would normally bring that back in February, but we are looking to brings guys back here starting right now,” said Richmond. “We're hiring. We just trained five new recruits yesterday.”<br/>And Woodtone is looking for even more employees.</p>
      <p>Aside from utilizing what many consider scrap wood, Woodtone is also minimizing its environmental footprint in other ways.</p>
      <p>With a mantra of 'no wood goes to waste,' pieces suitable to produce high-quality woodchips head to the chipper with waste wood being used to heat the driers for the operation.</p>
