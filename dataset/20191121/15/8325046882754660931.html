      <p>It was their interest in airplanes that brought the couple together.</p>
      <p>“We both love aviation, the bond is there,” said David in the video.</p>
      <p>Cathy and David met online in 2011 while playing the aviation video game “Airport City,” before meeting in person two years later, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/australia-new-zealand-marriage-plane-intl-hnk-scli/index.html">according to CNN.</a></p>
      <p>In a comment posted on her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004870939162">Facebook page,</a> Cathy said there was a bit of turbulence climbing out of Sydney but that the ceremony itself, which started 15 minutes after takeoff, was not affected.</p>
