      <h1>New amendments ensure tougher GMO rules in Latvia</h1>

        <b>On Thursday, November 21 Saeima approved urgently considered amendments to the Law on the Movement of Genetically Modified Organisms in the final reading, ensuring tougher requirements for the supervision and control of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), according to the parliamentary Press Service. </b>
      </p>
      <p>To prevent genetically modified seeds, plants and animals banned in the European Union from entering the Latvian market the amendments expand the roles of the Food and Veterinary Service, the “BIOR” Institute of Food Safety, Animal Health and Environment, and the State Plant Protection Service in relation to the monitoring of GMOs. The amendments also notably expand the authority of these institutions in regards to genetically modified animals.</p>
      <p>The amendments also give the State Plant Protection Service the right to restrict or ban seeds and propagation materials. The current law states that it is illegal to propagate seeds that are 0.1% genetically modified. However when the new regulations take effect it will be illegal to propagate seeds that are in any way genetically modified, restricting the cultivation of genetically modified plants in Latvia.</p>
