      <p>Ajay Devgn and Kajol may keep a low profile in B-town but there is no doubting them as actors, individually and together. The two, even after completing over twenty five years in the industry have a huge fan following and continue to deliver great cinema. Coming up next for them, Kajol and Ajay will be seen in Tanhaji The Unsung Warrior. It is after eleven years the actors will be sharing screen space. The last time they were seen together was in U Me aur Hum.</p>

      <p>Talking to Filmfare about working with Kajol on Tanhaji, Ajay Devgn had some nice things to say about his co-star cum wifey. He said, “Everybody knows she’s a fabulous actor. As an actor, working with somebody like her is always a delight. Apart from that, there’s an obvious comfort zone because she’s my wife and she makes me very comfortable.”</p>

      <p>When quizzed about the one thing he dislikes about him and would like to change about her personality, he was quick to respond, “She talks too much on the set. Whenever you tell her to concentrate, she’d probably be doing something else. I do keep complaining about her talking too much but when she’s quiet I keep asking her what’s wrong. So I don’t want to change anything.”</p>
      <p>Isn’t that just plain adorable?</p>
