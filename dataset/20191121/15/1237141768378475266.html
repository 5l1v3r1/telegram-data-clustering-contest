      <h1>Man Runs 196 Marathons in 196 Countries to Raise Money for Prostate Cancer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:37:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Dawson</a></address>
      <p>For nearly two years, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nickbutterrun/">Nick Butter</a>, of the United Kingdom, traveled all over the globe, stopping in every country—all 196 of them—to run 26.2 miles.</p>
      <p>The idea was as ambitious and bonkers as it sounds. The sheer cost alone is maddening to fathom—£1,000,000 (roughly $1,290,000), which includes money from fundraising and sponsors. Yet, for the 30-year-old who traded the life of banker and financier for the life of a lowly-paid sponsored runner, this was something outlandish he could do that no one else in the world had.</p>

      <p>But, he wasn’t doing it only for himself. Rather, it was for a friend, Kevin Webber, who Butter met at the 2015 <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/ultra/a27084556/what-is-the-marathon-des-sables/">Marathon des Sables</a>. Webber was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014. Despite his battle, Webber decided to live his life to fullest.</p>
      <p>“Kevin and I got on talking during the race, and he told me about this realization of his that because he was dying from prostate cancer, he now understood the value of life,” Butter told <i>Runner’s World</i>. “He just showed me the power of doing what you love, and not waiting for a diagnosis to do it.”</p>

      <p>Prostate cancer kills more than 11,000 people a year in just the United Kingdom. So, with Webber as his inspiration, he decided to use his global run to raise money for <a href="https://prostatecanceruk.org/">Prostate Cancer U.K.</a>, a nonprofit that funds research to stop prostate cancer.</p>
      <h3>A Trip Around the World</h3>
      <p>Planning a trip around the globe took two years. Luckily, most of his runs would not entail actual races, which slightly eased scheduling travel. But the logistics weren’t the only concerns. In the two years, Butter fundraised, gathered necessary visas, acquired security for certain countries, and researched locations to run in the various corners of the earth.</p>
      <p>Finally, on January 6, 2018, he packed his first bag and headed for Toronto, Ontario, for the first stop on his journey. Starting there, he worked his way down North America, through Central America, and then finishing all of South America before turning his attention east. He then split time between Africa and Europe and then completed Asia and Australia.</p>

      <p>During these adventures, Butter had to juggle two passports at a time—in total, he had nine throughout the trip. With those and 120 total visas, he was able to enter every country he visited.</p>
      <p>“You don’t want a stamp from one country that doesn’t get along with another,” he said. “Having multiple also meant juggling having the correct visas at the right time as I traveled. It was a lot to keep track of, but the passports are a great souvenir from the trip.”</p>

      <p>With 255,000 miles on just planes and being a constant stranger in strange lands, troubles arose often. Butter encountered food poisoning for 22 of his marathons, broke his elbow when he was hit by a car, was mugged in Nigeria, bit by a dog, and ran with a kidney infection.</p>
      <p>Yet, despite the complications, Butter never missed one of his 455 total flights around the world.</p>
      <p>“I think this is one of the things I’m most proud of,” he said.</p>

      <h3>196 Marathons</h3>
      <p>Averaging two and half to three marathons a week kept his schedule busy. Despite the constant movement, he was able to experience the world during his visits. Runners joined him—whether that was 1,000 school children in El Salvador or the president of Luxembourg—he ran on a live runaway in the Caribbean when there was nowhere else to run in the country, and alongside an erupting volcano in Guatemala.</p>

      <p>His favorite part, though, were the stories of the people he met and shared time with.</p>
      <p>“I was running on a beach in Oman at night time, and I was 10 miles from my hotel, and another guy joined me and we got to chatting,” Butter said. “A few hours later, I was at his home, his family cooked me dinner, he let me take a shower, and he gave me clothes to wear, and we’re still in touch today.</p>
      <p>“Saying yes to things ultimately leads to good things.”</p>
      <p>In the end, it took 22 months and more than 10,000,000 steps, but he made to his final run on November 10 in Athens, Greece. There, he found a crowd of his supporters and was able to cross a makeshift finish line with Webber by his side.</p>

      <p>Though November 21, Butter had raised<a href="https://justgiving.com/fundraising/runningtheworld"> $168,545 for Prostate Cancer U.K. </a>thanks to sponsors, friends, his planning team, and the people he met. And he doesn’t plan to stop there. He is still short of his $311,144 fundraising goal from the trip and hopes the press for his efforts gets him there. (For those interested in donating, you can do so <a href="https://justgiving.com/fundraising/runningtheworld">here</a>.)</p>
      <p>“With prostate cancer, if you catch it early, you have a greater likelihood of survival,” Butter said. “We need to remove the stigma of men being ashamed, shy, or embarrassed to speak about this. That’s what I hope my run did. Because we need to speak about it because people are dying.”</p>

      <h3>Reflections From the Journey</h3>
      <p>Experiencing 196 countries is not something many people in the world can claim. Through it all, Butter discovered a lot about the world that was unknown to him.</p>
      <p>For example, he realized people were generally happier in places where people had less, especially in poorer Asian countries where families live on one dollar a day. He also enjoyed observing the way people sat, prayed, ate, learned, and acted in public.</p>

      <p>He even encountered war zones, which he says news programs do not always portray accurately. Rather, he was able to see parts where people aren’t involved with the ongoing wars where the country’s<b> </b>beauty is.</p>
      <p>“Almost everywhere I went, people were welcoming,” Butter said. “These are experiences, cultures, and religions I would likely have never come across had I not done this. I feel like I’ve made a puzzle of the world, and when I put in the last piece, I realized that my idea of the world before I did this was not at all what I see with the puzzle now completed.”</p>

      <p>Though he plans to take a break from the marathon runs, he still plans to continue his travels. For 2020, he’s scheduling a world tour to share his story to business, schools, and anywhere that will have him. Butter also says he has a book and documentary in the works from this trip.</p>
