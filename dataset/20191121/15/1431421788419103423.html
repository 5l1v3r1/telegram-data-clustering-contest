      <p>President Donald Trump is insisting the Navy “will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin” that designates him a SEAL.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher had accused the Navy of trying to remove the designation in retaliation for Trump’s decision last week to restore Gallagher’s rank.</p>
      <p>Gallagher was acquitted of a murder charge in the stabbing death of an Islamic State militant captive, but a military jury convicted him of posing with the corpse while in Iraq in 2017. He was demoted to chief.</p>

      <p>Trump tweeted, “This case was handled very badly from the beginning” and urged those involved to “Get back to business!”</p>
      <p>Gallagher filed a complaint with the inspector general accusing a rear admiral of insubordination for defying Trump’s actions.</p>
