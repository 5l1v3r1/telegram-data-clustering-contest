      <p><i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i> is a film based on the life of the legendary Tanhaji Malusare, the military leader in the army Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and NCP leaders feel that the makers have tampered with the information in the trailer. They even asked the makers of the film to make changes to the trailer.</p>
      <p>Nationalist Congress Party legislator Jitendra Awhad threatened the makers of <i>Tanhaji</i> to get the fundamental facts of the film right. He asked the makers to not represent the history of the characters incorrectly. Jitendra Awhad even asked the makers of the film to make changes to the trailer in his tweet and said that he will take action against the film if the necessary changes are not made.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), a political party which is known for opposing the release of Hindi films dubbed in Marathi, approved the Om Raut directorial. MNS said, ‚ÄúIt should be dubbed in as many languages as possible.‚Äù</p>
      <p>Ajay Devgn took to Twitter to thank MNS for allowing Tanhaji to release simultaneously in Marathi and Hindi. He wrote, ‚ÄúThank you üôè Ameya &amp; MNS for allowing us to showcase our film Tanhaji in Marathi &amp; Hindi simultaneously. It‚Äôs our privilege to be able to share the story of this brave Maratha warrior in his mother tongue as well as the National Language‚Äù</p>

      <p>Earlier, Sambhaji Brigade‚Äôs officially stated, ‚ÄúMovies should be made on historical topics, but we will not tolerate the distortion of historical incidents/ facts.‚Äù</p>
