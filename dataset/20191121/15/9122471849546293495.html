      <h1>Coach Cal’s Message For Kentucky Fans Amid Early-Season Struggles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:00:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Kentucky to say the least. After suffering a stunning home upset to Evansville last Tuesday, the Wildcats were taken to the limit by Utah Valley this past Monday.</p>
      <p>As a result, fans are understandably nervous to see their team struggling against the mid-majors this early in the season.</p>
      <p>But Coach Cal has a message for the fans: This is what we do every year.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter on Wednesday, Calipari outlined the process that the team goes through to become better as the season progresses. He explained that it’s the same method he has been using for years.</p>

      <p>Calipari has certainly proven in his decade-long tenure at Kentucky that he can get his teams to reach a new level very quickly.</p>
      <p>But the fact that they suffered a loss to a mid-major this early in the season still stands out like a sore thumb.</p>
      <p>At 3-1 on the season, Kentucky still has plenty of games against less talented teams to clean up all of their mistakes.</p>
      <p>Their national title hopes depend on it.</p>
