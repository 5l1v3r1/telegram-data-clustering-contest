      <p>Ghanaian hiplife artiste, Patapaa, according to various interviews granted has revealed that he nearly lost his life through food poisoning.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/patapaa-hospitalized-after-being-in-a-critical-health-condition-minutes-before-a-show/">On October 28, news went viral that ‘One Corner’ hitmaker, Patapaa has been hospitalised after being in a critical condition just some minutes before a show.</a>
      </p>
      <p>According to the report, Patapaa was supposed to perform at a show the previous day but was quickly sent to St. Martins de Porres hospital just some few hours to his performance at the Kundum Show at Atuabo.</p>
      <p>Since then nothing was heard of the artist till today after he granted an interview with Sammy Flex, Halifax and SammyKay revealing how a friend tried to poison him with food.</p>
      <p><b>“I was poisoned when I went for a show at Tarkwa where I asked for an energy drink,”</b> Patapaa narrated.</p>
      <p>After taking the drink, he started hearing strange sounds in his stomach and shortly after, he started vomiting and having frequent stools.</p>
      <p><b>“My vomit was as dark as a polythene bag and my stool was black and filled with blood,”</b> he described the situation he suspects resulted from the poison.</p>
      <p>According to the One Corner hitmaker, it took the spiritual directions of his pastor for him to vomit thick black substances accompanied by clots of blood.</p>
      <p>Detailing his ordeal, he also made mention of the prophecy made by Eagle Prophet some weeks ago which he believed had manifested.</p>
      <p>According to Patapaa, he took the prophecy in good faith and worked towards preventing it but a friend he can’t pinpoint tried to outsmart him.</p>
      <p>The Founder and General Overseer of God’s Crown Chapel, Reindolph Oduro Gyebi, popularly known as the Eagle Prophet, during a program in his church said close friends of Patapaa would take his life through food poisoning.</p>
