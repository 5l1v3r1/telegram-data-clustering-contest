      <h1>Carpenter ordered to stop doing DIY overnight or face jail</h1>

      <p>A noisy carpenter has been banned from doing DIY in the evenings, after making his neighbours’ lives hell by hammering away in the early hours.</p>
      <p>Paul Bennett, 48, has been told to stop his woodworking sessions between 7pm and 9am, following a string of complaints from neighbours who say that their children’s lives had been severely impacted by his behaviour.</p>
      <p>Magistrates also warned Bennett that he faces jail, if he doesn’t comply.</p>
      <p>Next door neighbour Emma Mundy, who lives with her husband and two young children, told Bolton Magistrate’s Court that the family were forced to wear earplugs in the evenings to get away from the noise.</p>
      <p>At his sentencing yesterday, Bennett, from Bolton, was fined and made subject to a criminal behaviour order.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the bench Roy Davies stated: ‘Mr Bennett’s behaviour has had an almost daily impact on the family and would appear to be ongoing.</p>

      <p>‘This behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated by the court and no one should have to suffer from this daily nuisance.’</p>

      <p>The defendant was issued with a Bolton Council noise abatement notice in 2016 but his refusal to keep the noise down, led to him breaching it on two occasions.</p>
      <p>Following a complaint from Mrs Mundy, authority officials installed a noise recorder in her property to measure the goings on next door.</p>
      <p>Recordings from the machine showed noise coming from Bennett’s home on February 28 between 7.28pm and 8.23pm and on March 6 between 12.30am and 12.57am.</p>

      <p>There was more noise at odd hours on March 29, 30, 31 and April 1 and then again on May 12, 13, 17 and 18 and reports were compiled from transcripts of the recordings.</p>
      <p>Colette Renton, prosecuting, said: ‘She (Mrs Mundy) reported hearing noises that are largely banging, sometimes sawing and occasionally, what she thought to be plaster falling.</p>
      <p>‘Although she tries to sleep wearing ear plugs, she is regularly woken through the night and being tired affects her ability to work.</p>
      <p>‘She also feels that disturbance in her children’s sleep has an impact upon them.’</p>
      <p>Mrs Mundy says the noises are continuing to this day.</p>
      <p>Bennett was also fined £200 plus a £30 victim surcharge and must pay £1,000 towards prosecution costs.</p>
