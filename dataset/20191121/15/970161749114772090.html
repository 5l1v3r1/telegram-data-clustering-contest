      <p>Dozens of photos have emerged giving a look inside Jeffrey Epstein’s sprawling ‘baby-making ranch’ in the New Mexico desert.</p>
      <p>The disgraced financier entertained VIP guests at the secluded estate, outside Santa Fe, which reportedly boasted an eight-person ‘party’ shower and an underground strip club.</p>
      <p>Other photos display an indoor bathing area complete with huge pool, a life-sized sculpture of Jesus crucified on a cross and a lavish well-stocked library.</p>
      <p>Drone footage shows outhouses and farming equipment dotted around the Zorro Ranch’s neglected flatlands as well as the private airstrip the sex offender used to traffic underage girls on a private jet dubbed the ‘Lolita Express’, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7703257/New-photos-Jeffrey-Epsteins-New-Mexico-ranch-pedophiles-eight-person-party-shower.html">DailyMail.com</a> reported.</p>
      <p>It is one of several of Epstein’s homes where underage girls were flown in from all over the world.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/business/jeffrey-epstein-eugenics.html">New York Times</a> reported that the convicted paedophile, who killed himself in custody awaiting trial on further child sex charges, wished to impregnate scores of women at a time there to improve the human race with his genes.</p>

      <p>An anonymous contractor, who claimed to have worked at the ranch until 2006, told Albuquerque radio station owner Eddy Aragon the estate usually stayed quiet most of the year.</p>
      <p>However, when Epstein would turn up two or three times each year ‘with an entourage of 30 people or so’ the group ‘would party there’ and ‘pull out all the toys’.</p>

      <p>‘I had seen things in the house, on the computers, which made me evaluate whether I should be working for him or not,’ the former worker added.</p>
      <p>‘There was numerous photographs in frames, in his library, his office, on the walls, of young underage girls topless and him and various other powerful people.’</p>
      <p>The Mail also reported the station owner as having spoken to another ex-employee who revealed the paedophile built a space underground that was used ‘like a nightclub, with stripper poles’ where there would be ‘dancing’ and guests would hang out.</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew has come under intense media scrutiny over his association with the tycoon following a ‘car-crash’ BBC interview over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Duke of York faced criticism for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein’s victims and remorse over his friendship with the businessman.</p>
      <p>He took the dramatic decision of stepping down from official royal duties in the wake of the furore after a number of multi-million-pound businesses distanced themselves from him and his Pitch@Palace scheme.</p>
      <p>In his statement, the duke said he was ‘willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required’.</p>
