      <h1>Transfer Rumour: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang delays Arsenal contract renewal in hopes of Barcelona move</h1>

      <h3>Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is reportedly delaying contract talks with the Gunners and holding out for a move to Barcelona.</h3>
      <p>According to a report by Spanish publication <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/aubameyang-postpones-contract-talks-with-arsenal-waiting-for-barca-7744334">Sport</a>, Arsenal could be bracing themselves for the departure of their captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Gabonese striker has delayed talks over a new deal with the Gunners, in hopes of securing a move to Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang has been one of the most prolific strikers in Europe for years now, having gone head-to-head fellow stalwart Robert Lewandowski in the Bundesliga during his time with Borussia Dortmund. Since joining Arsenal nearly two years ago, the 30-year-old has only gone from strength to strength.</p>
      <p>In 79 appearances for the Gunners till date, Aubameyang has 50 strikes to his name, also supplying a further 12 assists. This season, the star striker has also been handed the added responsibility of being the club captain, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/08/21/transfer-news-arsenal-preparing-lucrative-contract-extension-for-pierre-emerick-aubameyang">with Arsenal now eager to tie him down to a new deal</a>. The Gabonese international, though, pining for a move to Barcelona.</p>

      <p>The La Liga champions signed Antoine Griezmann in the summer to bolster their attack. But, the Frenchman has seldom been utilised centrally by Ernesto Valverde, with Luis Suarez continuing to lead the line for Barcelona. Suarez, though, has been showing signs of regression for a couple of seasons now and will need to be replaced soon.</p>
      <p>To that end, Aubameyang could be a viable target for Barcelona, if they do set their sights on the Arsenal captain. <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/14/transfer-news-barcelona-balk-at-e100-million-valuation-of-erling-haaland">The Catalan giants have recently been linked with Erling Haaland</a>, among other young strikers.</p>
      <p>But, if they turn their attention towards Aubameyang, they could sign a player at the peak of his powers, someone who could be an immediate solution. As a result, the 30-year-old is holding off on talks over a new contract with Arsenal, waiting to see if Barcelona are seriously interested in him.</p>
      <p>Aubemayang’s current deal runs through to the summer of 2021, and Arsenal are desperate to agree a long-term deal with him. Meanwhile, officially, the player is also waiting to see if Arsenal can return to the Champions League, although <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/opinion/unai-emery-not-the-right-man-to-take-arsenal-forward">with the club in a disarray under Unai Emery</a>, it might prove to be difficult for them to tie him down to a new contract.</p>
      <p>It now remains to be seen if Barcelona step up their interest in Aubameyang and if so, we might see Aubameyang call time on his stint with Arsenal to join the La Liga champions in the near future.</p>
