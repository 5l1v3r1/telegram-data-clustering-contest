      <p>Manuel Pellegrini insists new Tottenham head coach Jose Mourinho is not his enemy as West Ham prepare to host the Portuguese boss’ first game in charge.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was announced as Spurs head coach on Wednesday morning, less than 12 hours after Mauricio Pochettino’s shock dismissal on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini has had several tussles with the 56-year-old while in charge of Malaga and Manchester City, but the Chilean played down their rivalry during Thusday’s press conference.</p>
      <p>When asked about facing Mourinho, Pellegrini said: “Maybe I can think in a different way, but he’s not my enemy.</p>
      <p>“Everyone has their options to play football in the way they want, to talk what they want to say. We have different ways of thinking about it all.”</p>
      <p>West Ham have struggled for form in recent weeks, with five defeats and two draws from their last seven matches, but will be hoping for an improvement against a new-look Tottenham outfit.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini expects some subtle tactical changes under their new head coach, despite Mourinho being at the helm for just two days.</p>
      <p>“Of course I think that the philosophy of (Mauricio) Pochettino is not the same as the philosophy of Mourinho, but he’s just in charge of the team,” Pellegrini said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think that in two days he will try to change anything properly.</p>
      <p>“So we will see Tottenham playing a similar way, of course with some touches of what Mourinho’s football is but that is not the most difficult problem to solve during the game.</p>
      <p>“The important problem is to have a good performance as a team.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho had been out of work since losing his job at Manchester United in December 2018 and faces a difficult task with Spurs currently in the bottom half of the Premier League on just 14 points from 12 matches, but Pellegrini still expects a tough challenge at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>“Tottenham has a very good team with important players, that make the difference. You cannot know what has happened there but the results were not what they are used to having.</p>
      <p>“Now they have a new manager, unfortunately for Mauricio Pochettino who did a very good job over a lot of years. I don’t know their reason why he was sacked.</p>
      <p>“Now they have another experienced manager in Jose that will bring important things to his team.”</p>
