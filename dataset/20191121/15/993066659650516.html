      <p>Gardai have arrested two men over the kidnapping and torture of Quinn industrial Holdings executive Kevin Lunney.</p>
      <p>A man aged 25 was arrested this afternoon in Dublin while a 66-year-old man was arrested in Co Cavan.</p>
      <p>Gardai announced this morning that two 38-year-old men <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/21/news/two-held-over-kevin-lunney-abduction-1771689/">had been arrested in Dublin</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney (50) a director of QIH, was snatched near his Co Fermanagh home and brutally assaulted in September.</p>
      <p>The father of six <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/06/news/-i-felt-i-was-going-to-die-kevin-lunney-tells-of-brutal-abduction-and-torture-1757694/">spoke out about the attack in a BBC Spotlight interview</a>, describing how he had been slashed with a knife, doused with bleach and branded by his captors before being dumped on a remote road in Co Cavan.</p>
      <p>Last week two men and a woman were arrested as part of the investigation. They were released without charge.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, key suspect Cyril McGuinness, known as "Dublin Jimmy", <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/18/news/cyril-mcguinness-died-from-cardiac-event-after-arrest-inquest-told-1768830/">died from a suspected "cardiac event"</a> after being handcuffed during a police raid in Derbyshire, England.</p>
      <p>Gardai and PSNI have agreed to establish a landmark "joint investigation" into <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/09/news/report-reveals-scale-of-harassment-and-intimidation-against-quinn-industrial-holdings-1760930/">the intimidation campaign against QIH executives</a>.</p>
