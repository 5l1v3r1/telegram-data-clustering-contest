      <p>YouTube has a tricky job of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/23/atandt-verizon-join-companies-pulling-ads-from-google-and-youtube/">making sure ads don't show up</a> alongside videos promoting extremist, hateful views or violence, yet also making sure it doesn't strip creators, who may post things like violent video game scenes, of their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/27/youtube-update-reduces-chances-of-videos-losing-ad-money/">revenue-earning potential</a>. In an attempt to get better at that, YouTube is experimenting with ways to match "edgy" videos with advertisers who are okay with content that's not totally PG.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2019/11/my-final-letter-in-2019.html">a letter</a> to YouTube creators, CEO Susan Wojcicki said YouTube is looking for advertisers who might advertise next to content with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/08/youtube-monetization-symbols-appeals/">yellow icon</a>, which means a video is "not suitable for all advertisers." This might appeal, for instance, to a marketer that wants to promote a R-rated movie. According to Wojcicki, "in its first month, this program resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in ads on yellow icon videos."</p>
      <p>The change could be especially beneficial for gaming creators, whose videos are often labeled yellow because they show violence in a game. Wojcicki acknowledges the call for policies that differentiated between real-world and gaming violence and says YouTube is working on a policy that will have fewer restrictions for violence in gaming.</p>
