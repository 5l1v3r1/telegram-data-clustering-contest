      <h2>The 20-year-old defender was strongly linked with a move to Barcelona before eventually deciding on the Serie A champions but has failed to re-create last season's form</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:47:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Matthijs de Ligt has insisted he is happy at Juventus despite claims from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> legend Patrick Kluivert that he may be regretting his decision to move to Italy from Ajax.</p>
      <p>De Ligt was one of the most sought-after players in the world over the summer following his wonderful performances during the 2018-2019 season, in which he helped Ajax to the semi-finals of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>After a huge amount of speculation he eventually joined <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> for Â£67.7m, but has come in for some criticism for his performances for the <i>Old Lady</i> so far.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Barcelona-based <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191119/471732492986/kluivert-creo-que-de-ligt-esta-un-poco-arrepentido-de-ir-a-la-juventus.html">Mundo Deportivo</a> Kluivert said on Tuesday: "I didn't personally try to convince him about joining Barcelona. I only told him about the positive aspects of Barcelona as a club and city.</p>

      <p>"We are obviously talking about a great defender and in the end he made a choice. I think he slightly regrets it now, but that's the way it is."</p>
      <p>However, De Ligt has responded by assuring Juventus supporters that he is happy at the club in spite of his shaky start in Turin.</p>
      <p>"I don't regret the fact I have moved to Juventus," he told <a href="https://www.voetbalprimeur.nl/">Voetbal Primeur</a> . "They are saying and writing a lot of stuff. If a person like Kluivert says something like that, it might seem true, but it really is just his assumption."</p>

      <p>Despite some of the criticism over de Ligt Juventus still sit at the top of Serie A, ahead of Inter Milan by one point.</p>
      <p>The Dutch international has played in all but three Serie A games so far this season, but has particularly struggled in the Champions League, and looked especially shaky during the 2-2 draw with Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>Juve are next in action when they travel to Atalanta on Saturday, and they then host Atletico in the Champions League on Tuesday.</p>
