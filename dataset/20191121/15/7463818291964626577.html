      <h1>OPPO launches new ColorOS 7 in China with noticeable improvements</h1>

      <p>The ColorOS may not be popular with the whole Android community but OPPO phone users very well know the UI. A new version is available with important improvements like faster user interface, lighter visuals, and a special Flashback button. New features can also be found on the ColorOS 7 including Focus Mode. Perhaps this is one of the more important upgrades in a while. The new OS version is also deemed smarter because it can switch to drive mode automatically in the car. It can also send sleep mode reminder at night.</p>
      <p>ColorOS 7 brings several camera-centric features to OPPO phones. The camera UI, night mode, super stabilization, Soloop video editor, and portrait mode 2.0 have been improved. Cropping and long screeshot with three-fingers are now supported.</p>
      <p>The new OS adds a special half screen feature to an OPPO device. It enables the UI to show small cards that contain information like alarm, calendar, and contacts. It also adds a special Flashback button that will be helpful when switching between apps. Just select that one-click switch between two apps or tasks.</p>
      <p>ColorOS also delivers support for the <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/oppo-xiaomi-and-vivo-team-up-to-work-on-new-file-transfer-20190820/">cross-brand file transfer protocol</a> established by OPPO, Xiaomi, and Vivo. Some OPPO models are finally getting this feature with the arrival of ColorOS 7. Overall, you can expect noticeable application fluency improvement by 30% and startup speeds by 25%. RAM utilization is more efficient by 40%. Touch response and gaming performance have also improved by 19% and 15% in ColorOS 7.</p>
