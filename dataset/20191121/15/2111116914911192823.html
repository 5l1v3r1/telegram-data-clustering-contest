      <p>At the moment we don't know exactly what deals John Lewis will be posting (although you can be sure we'll cover them all in detail), but we can gather a little from its Black Friday landing page.</p>
      <p>It seems the top deals will be on electronics, with images of a TV, a laptop and a smartwatch all present, and home and furniture, with a chair, a lamp and a cushion shown.</p>
      <p>There are also set to be deals on beauty items, clothes, toys, and sports and leisure items, although the appropriate icons are smaller than seen in the electrical and home and furniture sections, suggesting the deals won't be as prolific.</p>
