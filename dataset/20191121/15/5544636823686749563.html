      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would have won the Kogi governorship election if it had elected Bode Thomas as its National Chairman, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This was the assertion of a former Minister of Transport Ebenezer Babatope as <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/18/inec-declares-winner-of-kogi-governorship-election/">Governor Yahaya Bello of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was re-elected for a second term</a> in Kogi State.</p>
      <p>According to Babatope, the APC rigged the Kogi governorship election, adding that Bode Thomas would have stopped that from happening as the party’s leader.</p>
      <p>Also, he claimed that the Osun governorship election was rigged, alleging that the APC has no respect for democracy.</p>
      <p>”I believe that if Bode George had been elected the national chairman of our party, there is no way the APC can be doing what they are doing to our party today,” he told Daily Independent.</p>
      <p>“The Bode George I know will not allow them to have a field day manipulating elections as they did in Ekiti and Osun and now, Kogi and Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>“The way Kogi was shamelessly rigged makes me very sad.”</p>
