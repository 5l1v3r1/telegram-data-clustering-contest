      <p>KSI has revealed he will fight again – but a rematch with Logan Paul is off the cards.</p>
      <p>We can’t say we’re mad about it.</p>
      <p>The YouTube star, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/ksi-triumphs-logan-paul-boxing-rematch-fierce-fight-11068044/">who triumphed against the odds when he took on the American YouTuber</a>, has now revealed he’s up for getting back in the ring after previous uncertainty.</p>
      <p>‘I’m gonna fight again, but I don’t think I need to fight Logan again,’ he <a href="https://www.ringtv.com/584626-ksi-still-buzzing-from-logan-paul-victory-says-he-will-continue-boxing-fellow-celebs-that-is/">told The Ring.</a></p>
      <p>‘I think it would make more sense to fight celebs, that would draw more attention, me fighting a journeyman wouldn’t bring numbers.</p>

      <p>‘I’m a businessman, I do things that make sense.’</p>
      <p>However, when presented with the idea of fighting Justin Bieber, who strongly supported his opponent in the match,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/ksi-admits-slap-justin-bieber-backs-logan-paul-boxing-rematch-11073206/"> the YouTube star laughed off the idea</a> – so it’s not clear who exactly he has in mind.</p>
      <p>Despite KSI – real name Olajide ‘JJ’ Olatunji – being done with fighting Logan, it seems his rival isn’t on the same page.</p>
      <p>After being deducted two points, which led to him losing the match, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/logan-pauls-appeal-controversial-ksi-loss-formally-investigated-athletic-commission-11192751/">the 24-year-old has filed an appeal with the California State Athletic Commission</a>, who have confirmed they will be formally investigating.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for CSAC told TMZ: ‘The executive director Andy Foster is evaluating. If there’s sufficient grounds, it’ll go to a hearing at a commission meeting.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/logan-paul-insists-not-sore-loser-officially-challenges-ksi-fight-result-punishment-simply-not-fit-crime-11172289/">Despite KSI fans urging Logan to ‘take the L’, he later said</a>: ‘The 2 point deduction was the reason I full out split decision lost the fight. My team and I have decided to file an official appeal for the fight because we just don’t believe that the outcome was right.</p>

      <p>‘It just resonates with me to my core. One of my biggest fears about this is being a sore loser and that’s why I made this video a week after the fight.</p>
      <p>‘I really had to check myself and make sure I wasn’t doing this because I was afraid of losing.</p>
      <p>‘Historically I’ve taken big Ls. By no means am I afraid of losing. I welcome it because it’s the only way I tend to experience growth in my life. But I truthfully, 100 per cent believe I did not lose this fight.</p>
      <p>‘This is just a plea to the California State Athletic commission, I would just hope that you guys give this the weight it deserves.’</p>
      <p>And so, the drama continues.</p>
