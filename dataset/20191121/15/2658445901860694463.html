      <p>The National President, Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) Mr. Honour Sirawoo is in Yobe for a two day official visit as part of his administration’s commitment to building a stronger SWAN across the country.</p>
      <p>Sirawoo who arrived Damaturu Thursday via Maiduguri went straight to the August 27 Stadium where he separately addressed various athletes including the State Female Hockey team, Yobe Desert Football fielder team, the state para-soccer team and the basketball team.</p>
      <p>During his address to the different athletes, Mr. Sirawoo advised them to look at sports beyond pleasure and recreation but a money spinning venture that can change their life for good.</p>
      <p>The number one sports journalist in Nigeria also called on Yobe state government to harness sports and curtail youth effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Sirawoo who appreciated the level of engagement of young talents in the sports development architecture of the state said with determination, their dreams of becoming great players could be achieved.</p>

      <p>According to him, “Sports is now a serious business, if you do it well you will attract wealth, you will attract respect to your people, you will serve as model to others and be useful to society, you will put food on your table and the table of others,” he said.</p>
      <p>The SWAN President who charged members of the association in the state to be proactive equally called on government to upgrade facilities at the August 27 stadium to expand the fortunes of sports in Yobe State.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sirawoo who was particularly happy with the state female hockey team preparing to represent Nigeria at an international hockey championship in Egypt charged them not to go for anything less than the ultimate prize..</p>
      <p>The visit continues with a courtesy call on the Emir of Bade, Alhaji Abubakar Umar Suleiman II , who is a strong supporter of Sports and SWAN in Yobe State.</p>
