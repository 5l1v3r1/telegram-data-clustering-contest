      <p>The biennial awards aims to recognize advertising campaigns that uphold Filipino values based on the Ad Foundation’s ARAW cornerstone values of love of God; commitment to truth, honesty, and integrity; love of country and respect for national customs and traditions; reverence for family unit or marriage or responsible parenthood; respect and care for human life, dignity and the rights of all; respect for law and authority and the promotion of self- discipline; and concern for and preservation of the environment. In pursuit of this goal, 419 campaigns have entered the running, including 49 entries that have qualified for the ARAW Values Technical Awards recognizing technical excellence in the field of advertising. The ARAW Values Technical Awards program is being held for the first time by Ad Foundation. To keep with the high standards that the ARAW Values Awards program has set over the years, the Ad Foundation in partnership with ABS-CBN have also announced a change in the program’s schedule. The Awards Night is now set on Jan. 31, 2020, with a nationwide telecast special to be aired by the network in mid-February, and with “global feeds” thereafter through the TFC in 7 territories worldwide. The 11th ARAW Values Advertising Awards’ online judging for its Finalists-Metals Round is being held from Nov. 15 to 29, 2019, with 70 confirmed judges participating, comprising the seven Jury Panels,  each with distinct judging assignments. Preliminary judging for the 2019 ARAW Values Technical Awards is also being held from Nov. 18 to 29, with two panels each, comprised of select, eminent personalities with multi-discipline technical expertise from the multi-sector advertising industry’s production service and allied industries as well such as that of the movie, film-making, printing and photography industries. “The revised schedules will be advantageous to the competition, especially on the quality of judging,” Ma. Belen (Blen) Fernando, ARAW Values Awards Overall Organizing Chairperson and board member of the Advertising Foundation of the Philippines, said. The revised schedule, she added, will keep the program from conflicting with the airing of the upcoming Southeast Asian Games, which the Philippines will host from late November to early December. Only the audit team of the ARAW Values Awards independent auditing firm, P&amp;A Grant Thornton, will have access to the online Jury System. Among the firm’s tasks are design-development of the Judges Rating sheets in accordance to the sets of Competition Rules for the 11<sup>th</sup> ARAW Values Advertising Awards and the 2019 ARAW Values Technical Awards;  the verification of all Judges’ Accomplished Sheets; Tabulation of Results; as well as the Certification of Judging Results &amp; Preparation, and the Submission of the Auditor’s Reports on the Results of the twin-ARAW Competitions. Formal invites are ongoing for the members of the two panels of Special Jury, comprised of highly eminent personalities with respect and integrity, that will judge all the top winning entries vying for the Platinum Awards and for the Most Outstanding/Excellent Technical Expertise for Branded Communications and/or Advocacy Communications of the 11<sup>th</sup> ARAW Values Advertising Awards and the 2019 ARAW Values Technical Awards, respectively, Meanwhile, the Executive Committee of ARAW Values Awards, decided to revive “The ARAW People’s Choice Special Awards”, to be held in collaboration with ABS-CBN. To recognize the advertising campaigns that speak to the hearts of the Filipino public, a popular vote will be held through online social media or through IMS during the third or fourth week of January, up to the nationwide telecast’s schedule, among all the Gold winners of the 11<sup>th</sup> ARAW Values Advertising Awards.</p>
