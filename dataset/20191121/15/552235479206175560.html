      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:40:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Gillespie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-gillespie/</a></address>
      <p>Stewartry Sharks were delighted to pick up the Stewartry Sports Council Club of the Year award at the annual awards night on Friday.</p>
      <p>Co-ordinator Susan Hind praised the hard work and enthusiasm of the boys and girls who turn up every Sunday in all weather from September to May.</p>
      <p>The players, coaches and Susan are extremely proud of everything that’s been achieved at Stewartry Sharks.</p>
      <p>Following their success the micros, P4/5 and P6/7 teams headed to Annan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Micros</p>
      <p>A very busy schedule saw the micros play seven games. A great turnout meant plenty of players to choose from.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They started off with wins against Moffat Blue and Annan before losing out to Dumfries White, who scored two late tries.</p>
      <p>After that they faced Bigger A and defeated them, losing next to Dumfries Black. Their encounter with Biggar B was end to end stuff with Stewartry taking the victory and their final game against Moffat Yellow ended in a try.</p>
      <p>Thanks to everyone who made the trip, it was a great day and all the micros should be very proud of themselves. They have improved greatly and work very well together.</p>
      <p>P4/5</p>
      <p>Stewartry played some fine rugby once they settled into their game. An abundance of numbers allowed some new player combinations to be tried out.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Stewartry recorded wins over Wigtownshire, Bigger A and Annan and lost to Moffat and Biggar B.</p>
      <p>P6/7</p>
      <p>The team had a fantastic day, finishing the tournament undefeated.</p>
      <p>Players were making tackles and scoring tries for fun, with Ryan, Liam, Finlay and Zak the main scorers.</p>
      <p>However, it was a team effort from Ryan, Angus, Finley, James, Liam, Mathew, Oliver, Duncan, Fraser and Zak.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">Training is at 10.30am on Sunday and all are welcome to attend these sessions.</a>
