                      <h3>Jose Mourinho responds to ‘will never join Tottenham’ claim by taking a dig at Chelsea</h3>
                      <p>Mourinho became a known name in the Premier League through his success with Chelsea. However, he has urged Tottenham fans not to see him as a Chelsea man,</p>
                      <p>
                        <i>“I think they have to see me as Mr Inter, Mr Real Madrid, Mr Porto, “</i>
                        <i>he said.</i>
                        <i> “I am a club man, but a many clubs man.” </i>
                      </p>

                        <anchor name="div-gpt-ad-ATD-TS-RES7">
                          <p>That must’ve surely hurt Chelsea fans but that was not the end of it. When reminded that he promised to never come at Tottenham during his time with Chelsea and what had changed? Jose replied:</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>
                              <i>“Yes, that was before I was sacked!</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>Now that will surely burn all bridges with Chelsea supporters. Any soft corners Mourinho resided in at the Stamford Bridge will probably be vacated now. It appears that Mourinho is still miffed about the manner of his departure from the club in his second stint with them.</p>
                            <p>On 17 December 2015, after losing 9 of 16 Premier League matches, Chelsea announced that they had parted company with Mourinho “by mutual consent”. The club released a statement saying:</p>
                            <p>“The club wishes to make clear Jose leaves us on good terms and will always remain a much-loved, respected and significant figure at Chelsea.”</p>
                            <p>Oh, the irony… From Mourinho’s statement tonight, it doesn’t seem like the departure was on good terms. It is also hard to see him still being a man of significance at the bridge,</p>
