      <p>Bristol are the only English club involved in European competition on Friday night as they look to build Challenge Cup momentum by toppling Brive.</p>
      <p>The Gallagher Premiership leaders maintained their strong domestic form by flattening Zebre 59-21 in their Pool Four opener but Brive are more dangerous opponents than the underpowered Italians.</p>
      <p>“It’s a massive game because with all teams fighting on both sides, us getting a win over there would be huge for our ambition,” director of rugby Pat Lam said.</p>
      <p>“Not only do we want to win our group but also get a home quarter-final and a home semi-final.</p>
      <p>“I’ve made no secret of the fact that I wasn’t happy with how we played against Zebre, but I’ve been so pleased with the training we’ve had since.</p>
      <p>“It’s been superb and guys have been on the money as far as attitude goes.”</p>
      <p>Steven Luatua recovers from a hip injury to lead Bristol, while the return of former England lock Dave Attwood is also one of eight changes made for the trip to Stade Amedee-Domenech.</p>
      <p>In the solitary Champions Cup match, Ulster host Clermont at Kingspan Stadium.</p>
