      <p>Israel’s attorney general is set to announce his long-awaited decision on whether to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a series of corruption scandals.</p>
      <p>Avichai Mandelblit’s ruling promises to upend the Israeli political world after two inconclusive elections.</p>
      <p>If, as widely expected, he presses charges against the prime minister, it would deal a heavy blow to Mr Netanyahu’s hopes of remaining in office.</p>
      <p>If Mr Netanyahu is cleared, it would give him a major boost as the country braces for the possibility of its third election in under a year.</p>

      <p>The allegations against Mr Netanyahu include suspicions that he accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends, offered to trade favours with a newspaper publisher, and used his influence to help a wealthy telecoms magnate in exchange for favourable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu has called the allegations part of a witch-hunt, lashing out against the media, police, prosecutors and the justice system.</p>
      <p>The PM has scheduled a press conference for an hour after Mr Mandelblit’s expected announcement on Thursday evening.</p>
