      <h1>Bitcoin Price Breaks Below $8,000, As Bears Erase Historic Rally</h1>

      <p>The leading cryptocurrency by market cap, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>, has once again broken below $8,000 <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/bitcoin-price-bulls-defend-make-it-break-it-support-level-at-8000/">after the repeated defense of the critical support level</a> by bullish crypto investors. Now that bears are back in control, they’ve already pushed Bitcoin price to as low as $7,500, putting Bitcoin is at risk of further downside.</p>
      <p>But where are the key levels where a bounce may occur, and when will the crypto asset return to a bull market?</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price Breaches $8,000, Quickly Returns to $7,500</h3>
      <p>In late October, a powerful bullish impulse from $7,400 to $10,500, setting the crypto asset’s third-largest one-day gain in its short, decade-long history, caused the entire market to turn bullish once again, despite weeks of ongoing downtrend.</p>
      <p>The thought was that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> doesn’t perform so well and have such enormous gains outside of a bull market, however, the entire move may have been nothing more than a massive short squeeze and bearish retest of former support turned resistance.</p>
      <p>However, the powerful rally has all but been erased at this point, with the first-ever cryptocurrency falling to $7,500 this morning after a break of $8,000. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price dropped below $8,000</a>, and not even 24 hours later, another $500 was wiped out in value from the crypto asset.</p>
      <p>Bulls have thus far been able to defend $7,500, causing a slight bounce to as high as $7,650 as of the time of this writing, but the defense is already starting to fail and return to declining prices.</p>
      <p>Support at this level, ranging from $7,300 where the previous major reversal occurred, through $7,500 is a critical level that bulls must defend to prevent a much deeper drop into the $6,000 range.</p>
      <h3>What Happened to the Bull Market? Will BTC Return to Bear?</h3>
      <p>If bulls aren’t able to defend current levels, a push to as low as $6,600 to the bottom of the downtrend channel <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> has been trading within since June is likely to result.</p>
      <p>However, if bulls can defend this level, they must reclaim above $8,000 for a chance to return to a bull market. Otherwise, Bitcoin price could fall further into a continued bear market and potentially set a new bear market low.</p>

      <p>It’s long been thought that Bitcoin, after bottoming back in December 2018 around $3,100, was ready to begin its next bull run, but after the 2019 parabolic rally failed to set a new high, the crypto asset ran out of steam and has been falling in value ever since.</p>
      <p>The days ahead are critical for Bitcoin, and the current price action could <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/bitcoin-price-bulls-defend-make-it-break-it-support-level-at-8000/">make it or break it</a> for the first-ever cryptocurrency.</p>
