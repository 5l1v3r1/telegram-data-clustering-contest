      <p>Asia’s equivalent to the popular Cannes Film Festival, <a href="https://iffigoa.org/#news">IFFI</a> aims at facilitating a common stage for artists from around the world to showcase the flavours of cinema from their regions.</p>
      <p>The Golden Jubilee edition of IFFI will feature eight extraordinary films by Russian directors that have been included in the 2019 line up.</p>
      <p>Two of the most talked-about movies from Russia are “Abigail” by 30-year old Aleksandr Boguslavsky and “Andrei Tarkovsky: A Cinema Prayer” – a masterpiece documentary by Tarkovsky himself, who died back in 1986.</p>

      <p>While “Abigail” revolves around a girl named Abigail who thinks she lost her father to an epidemic only to find out later that no epidemic actually even occurred, “Andrei Tarkovsky: A Cinema Prayer” recounts Tarkovsky’s life and work as he shares his memories, views and reflections on art, destiny of an artist and the meaning of human existence.</p>
      <p>Other Russia-originated movies include “Acid”, “Beanpole”, “Great Poetry”, “Once in Trubchevsk”, “Why don’t you just die!” and “The Hero” by directors Alexander Gorchilin, Kantemir Balagov, Aleksandr Lungin, Larissa Sadilova, Kirill Sokolov, and Karen Oganesyan respectively.</p>
      <p>On 20 November, legendary Indian megastars <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911071077244360-indias-megastar-of-the-millennium-amitabh-bachchan-celebrates-50-years-in-bollywood/">Amitabh Bachchan</a> and Rajinikanth inaugurated the film festival in the Goa capital of Panjim, with ace Bollywood director Karan Johar hosting the ceremony.</p>
