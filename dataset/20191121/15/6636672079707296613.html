        <b>Mouser Electronics is stocking the S32K ISELED enabled microcontrollers from NXP Semiconductors. Part of NXP’s family of S32K automotive-qualified microcontrollers, these devices offer the same feature set in addition to the ISELED communication protocol.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The protocol avoids external processes and targets well-balanced light parameters with tight calibration and processing control for RGB LEDs.</p>
      <p>The microcontrollers combine 32-bit Arm Cortex-based processing power and access to this communication ecosystem, enabling engineers to create dynamic sequences and light parameters.</p>

      <p>Depending on the family, the devices feature either an Arm Cortex-M0+ core (S32K11x) or an Arm Cortex-M4F core (S32K14x) that include a production license and a dedicated driver to run the serial communication protocol.</p>
      <p>The ISELED software driver runs within the SDK included in the S32 Design Studio IDE or in the AUTOSAR environment. Additionally, each microcontroller can serve as a single external master controller within the communication ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Mouser also sells evaluation boards for the MCUs, including the S32K144EVB. Based on the S32K144 microcontroller, the S32K144EVB offers a form factor compatible with the Arduino Uno pin layout, providing a range of expansion board options for application prototyping and demonstration.</p>
