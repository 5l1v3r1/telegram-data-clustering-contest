      <h1>SAWS explains why the Bapsfontein ‘tornadoes’ were just ‘gustnadoes’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:10:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Walker</a></address>
      <p>The South African Weather Service (SAWS) on Thursday issued an <a href="https://twitter.com/SAWeatherServic/status/1197517799729614849">educational media release</a> describing the differences between tornadoes and “gustnadoes” which were observed in Gauteng and Mpumalanga on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>This comes after videos and images were uploaded to social media documenting the phenomena.</p>

      <p>And yes, there is a difference.</p>
      <p>“On Wednesday 20 November 2019 ‘tornadic’ shaped vortices were observed between Delmas [Mpumalanga] and Bapsfontein [Gauteng] between 2pm and 5pm SAST,” began the media statement.</p>

      <p>SAWS noted that while gustnadoes — or dust devils — look like tornadoes, they are meteorologically different.</p>
      <p>For one there was no visible “condensation funnel cloud extending from the cloud base to the ground” nor were Wednesday’s gustnadoes “associated with supercell thunderstorms.”</p>
      <p>SAWS also likely issued the release to quell rumours, something that the service was also forced to do after hoax tornado <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/10/saws-ekurhuleni-tornado-hoax/">warnings swept across Ekurhuleni in October</a>.</p>
      <p>Either way, we feel “gustnadoes” is a much cooler name.</p>
      <h3>Inclement week of weather in South Africa</h3>
      <p>Tornadoes and other severe weather phenomena have been a topic of public conversation since <a href="https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/kwazulu-natal/pics-and-videos-tornado-leaves-trail-of-destruction-in-kzn-farming-community-37179467">a duo struck various parts of rural KwaZulu-Natal</a> last week.</p>
      <p>Gauteng has also experienced some inclement weather this week, with <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/11/gauteng-rain-floods-video-twitter/">flooding in parts of Centurion</a> observed by residents on Wednesday.</p>
