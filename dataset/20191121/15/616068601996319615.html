      <p>A Nanaimo man is awaiting sentencing for possession and distribution of over 200,000 images and videos of child pornography.</p>
      <p>Aaron Macrae was found in possession of a large collection of child pornography depicting graphic images of young children and even toddlers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/">CTV News Vancouver Island</a> is reporting that Macrae is described as a high risk to reoffend and he has also been found to have secretly recorded his customers' children at some of the different cell phone stores he has worked at across Nanaimo.</p>
      <p>Macrae was caught after a photo uploaded to social media was deemed child pornography. The RCMP Integrated Child Exploitation Unit tracked him using his IP address and discovered hundreds of thousands of child porn images.</p>
      <p>After the initial search, Macrae fled Nanaimo but was arrested in November 2018 in Abbotsford.</p>
