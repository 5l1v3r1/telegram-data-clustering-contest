      <h1>Marty Moore signs new two-year deal with Ulster</h1>
      <h2>The 28-year-old former Leinster tighthead prop joined Ulster from Wasps in the summer of 2018</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:55:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Following the announcement of Billy Burns' contract extension, Ulster are further boosted ahead of tomorrow's Champions Cup clash with Clermont tomorrow night with Marty Moore's decision to sign a new two-year deal.</p>
      <p>Moore, the 28-year-old former Leinster tighthead prop, joined Ulster from Wasps in the summer of 2018 and has played 22 times for the province.</p>
      <p>Having missed the start of the season through injury, Moore made an impressive return in the most recent games against Munster and Bath. <br/><br/>"I’ve settled in really well at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ulster-rugby">Ulster</a> and have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the club, so I’m delighted to be able to get a deal sorted for another two years," said the Ireland front row. </p>
      <p>"Working with the coaches and wider support staff, I feel like I still have a lot of potential to improve, and I’m enjoying that process. We’re a club with big ambitions and I’m looking forward to playing my part in helping to achieve those." <br/><br/>Head Coach, Dan McFarland commented: "Marty has been a great addition to the squad. </p>
      <p>"His ability and experience at set piece time has been demonstrated time and again, and has helped all our props make significant progress. </p>
      <p>"His performances over the last two games have been excellent and he is keen to keep developing as part of our squad going forward."</p>
