      <h1>Dalbeattie man whose dog went missing thanks community for finding his beloved companion</h1>
      <h2>Jonty Durok was relieved to be reunited with his eight-year-old Collie Tye after a frantic 22-hour search</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:40:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Galloway News, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/galloway-news/</a></address>
      <p>A man whose startled dog sparked a community search has thanked those who came to the aid of his missing pet.</p>
      <p>Dalbeattie residents turned out in force to help Jonty Durok find Tye, who bolted after he was spooked by a loud noise.</p>
      <p>He fled after a racket from the nearby sawmill disturbed his regular walk in the town wood, prompting a frantic 22-hour search.</p>
      <p>Jonty said the eight-year-old Collie had been in a heightened state of anxiety due to fireworks’ season.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He told the News: “He is a nervy dog anyway but he has been a bit worse since the fireworks started coming about again. I think between that and the bangs coming from the sawmill that morning, that was what happened.”</p>
      <p>Jonty, daughters Emma, Jackie and other family members mounted a search for the fleeing dog after his Thursday morning disappearance.</p>

      <p>Numbers were bolstered when more than 40 volunteers stepped in to join the hunt and scour the town.</p>
      <p>The search was called off shortly before midnight on Thursday but resumed on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>And that’s when frantic Jonty and daughter Jackie eventually found the startled pet cowering in undergrowth about half a mile into the wood from where he originally disappeared.</p>
      <p>Jonty said: “I was so glad to get him back. He was really cold and we covered him with his blanket and took him home. He has been getting a lot of TLC.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Tye is now back to his regular walk but Jonty confesses he will be “keeping him on his lead”, meantime.</p>
      <p>He added: “I would really like to thank everyone who came to help. I was touched. There was even a lad out close to midnight with a torch.</p>
      <p>“The people of Dalbeattie are a great community and seem to rise to the occasion when its needed anyway but I was very grateful.”</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">Jackie also took to social media to say thanks to all those who assisted with the search.</a>
