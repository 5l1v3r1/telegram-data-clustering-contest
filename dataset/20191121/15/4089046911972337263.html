      <p><b>OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT/Gray News) --</b> There’s a lot of toilet paper lining the streets of Omaha, and the tissue is there to keep traffic moving.</p>

      <p>Crews from Midwest Coating of Modale, Iowa are filling cracks in the pavement. Then, they’re applying toilet paper.</p>
      <p>“We use the toilet paper as a blotter material in a moving operation so we’re able to keep traffic going without putting up a closure,” Angel Nies with Midwest Coating said.</p>
      <p>Some may have thought it was the handy work of pranksters, but it actually is serving a purpose.</p>
      <p>Without toilet paper, the work crews would have to shut down the street while the workers complete the job.</p>
