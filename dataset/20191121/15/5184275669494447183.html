      <p>After the grand success of <i>Happy Hardy and Heer</i> tour in Pune, now Super hit machine singer-composer actor rockstar Himesh Reshammiya has rocked Surat City. Here’s the clip where the fans went crazy over Himesh Reshammiya’s performance as they listened to the songs from Happy Hardy and Heer.</p>
      <p>The film is the biggest Musical of the year with a very powerful love story of three characters – Happy, Hardy and Heer who are very Indian at heart and embark on a journey of true love. The movie will showcase Himesh Reshammiya in a double role for the very first time. The film also stars the very beautiful Sonia Mann.</p>
      <p>Himesh and the makers of the film Deepshikha Deshmukh and Sabita Manakchand and the music label tips decided to use a very different strategy of releasing the songs ahead of the trailer which worked out very well for them. Now that the music has become a blockbuster hit with teri meri kahani and Ashiqui mein teri topping the biggest charts all over they have decided to do huge promotional concerts in 12 cities across India.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think any other film has ever used a promotional strategy like this ever before and this has been possible only because of the audience who have made the music so popular even before its trailer has released which we are planning to do so by the end of the month on a very grand scale. This will be also the very first time that the trailer will be released at a music success bash of a film. I am grateful that the trailer of the film is much awaited by the audience and I am looking forward to the upcoming concerts in all other cities of India as well.” said Himesh.</p>
