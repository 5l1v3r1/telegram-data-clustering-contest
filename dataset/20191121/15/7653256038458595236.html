      <p><b>By Marwa Rashad and Sylvia Westall<br/></b><br/>RIYADH/DUBAI: The institutional tranche of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Saudi-Aramco">Saudi Aramco</a>'s <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/initial-public-offering">initial public offering</a> (IPO) has been oversubscribed while the retail portion has received a little more than 10 billion riyals ($2.67 billion) in orders so far, a banking source told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Thursday, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya, citing a banking source, said the institutional tranche of the deal had received more than 64 billion riyals, while the retail portion received 10 billion riyals.</p>
      <p>Aramco, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, plans to sell 1.5% of the company, or about 3 billion shares, at an indicative price range of 30 riyals to 32 riyals, valuing the IPO at as much as 96 billion riyals and giving the company a potential market value of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion.</p>
      <p>Representatives of the state-owned oil giant plan meetings with investors in Dubai next week, sources have said, for what is expected to be the world's biggest share sale.</p>
      <p>Aramco has said at least one-third of the sale is expected to be covered by retail investors, who have until Nov. 28 to sign up for the IPO.</p>
      <p>Institutional investors can subscribe until Dec. 4.</p>
      <p>Aramco kicked off the sale process on Nov. 3 after a series of false starts. The deal is crucial for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to raise billions of dollars to invest in non-oil industries, create employment and diversify the world's top crude exporter away from oil.</p>
