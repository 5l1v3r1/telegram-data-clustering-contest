      <p>Jon Cooper, the chairman of the Democratic Coalition, called out Donald Trump on Twitter for claiming that he opened a new Apple plant in Texas this week.</p>
      <p>This comes after reports that Trump toured an Apple manufacturing plant in Austin alongside Apple CEO Tim Cook, where he took credit for opening the plant while speaking to the media. Trump also tweeted, "Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn’t care about American Workers!" </p>
      <p>However, as Cooper pointed out, the plant has been open since 2013. He responded to Trump by writing, "Apple actually opened that plant in 2013 during the Obama administration, you lying dipsh*t."</p>
