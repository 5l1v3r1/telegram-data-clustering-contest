      <p>Wall Street's main indexes started the day modestly lower on Thursday as investors continue to assess the latest developments surrounding the United States (US)-China trade dispute and wait for fresh headlines coming out of the day four of President Trump impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>As of writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were all down 0.1% on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Although the South China Morning Post (SCMP) earlier in the day reported that the US could delay the December tariff hike even if a deal is not finalized by then, investors seem to be refraining from reacting to every headline. In fact, the CBOE <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/volatility">Volatility</a> Index, Wall Street's fear gauge, is up nearly 4% to reflect the dismal mood.</p>
      <p>Among the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors, 9 of which are in the negative territory in the early trade, the Energy Index outperforms by adding nearly 1% on the back of rising crude oil prices.</p>
