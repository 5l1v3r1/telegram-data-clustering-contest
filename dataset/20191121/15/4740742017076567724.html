      <h1>Eswatini fans 'assault' pastor for weather ritual after Bristol City striker Famara Diedhiou's hat-trick for Senegal</h1>
      <h2>The Bristol City netted an eight-minute hat-trick</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:52:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Eswatini fans have reportedly assaulted a man believed to be a pastor following the country's 4-1 defeat to Senegal on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> striker Famara Diedhiou scored an impressive eight-minute hat-trick in the second half to put his country 3-0 up and cruising to victory in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifying game before both sides then scored a late goal each.</p>
      <p>However, the hat-trick only came after a break in play due to a thunderstorm, which threatened to call a halt to the game.</p>
      <p>In bizarre scenes, African sports journalist Nuhu Adams has reported that a man claiming to be a pastor entered the pitch to pray when the game was suspended due to thunderstorms.</p>

      <p>The break in play happened in the 57th minute and, one minute after the restart, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Robins </a>striker Diedhiou scored his first goal of the game in the goal that the ritual took place in, netting again seven and eight minutes later.</p>
      <p>Adams has reported that the man who claimed to be a pastor was been assaulted by fans due to the result.</p>

      <p>"We tried to interview him after the game," Jele said.</p>
      <p>"He said he was sent by local authorities to go and perform rituals on the field.</p>
      <p>"What is so strange, all the goals came after the man entered the pitch and held one of the goal posts."</p>
