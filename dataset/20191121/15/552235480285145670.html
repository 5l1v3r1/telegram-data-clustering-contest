      <h1>The Celtic and Rangers stars dominating SPFL team of the week award - but who leads the way?</h1>
      <h2>With the Christmas period on the near horizon we've had a look to see which players are setting the pace.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:20:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>This junction in the season, as we ramp up towards the festive madness, is always a key one up and down the country.</p>
      <p>The international break gave us all a breather, but the November hiatus from club football usually serves as the calm before the storm.</p>
      <p>Once we get back underway at the weekend, we head barrelling towards a hectic Christmas schedule, and the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> , Odsonne Edouard and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lawrence-shankland">Lawrence Shankland</a> - and the rest of the country's stand-out performers so far - will look to keep their scintillating form rolling.</p>
      <p>But while Celtic and Rangers lead the way at the top of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> , it's the Dundee United star who sets the pace for Scottish football's forwards - according to the SPFL's team of the week awards.</p>
      <p>The newly-capped Scotland striker is the country's top scorer by a distance, hammering in 17 to put Robbie Neilson's men nine clear at the top of the Championship.</p>

      <p>And in recognition of his goal-scoring antics, he is the only player to have been named four times in the governing body's best XI.</p>
      <p>He's closely followed by Morelos and Clyde's David Goodwillie - each of whom have earned themselves three places apiece, while Jermain Defoe - the Premiership's top scorer with 11 - joins Edouard on two.</p>
      <p>The Scottish champions have the most nominations overall, with Mohamed Elyounoussi's two-goal showing in the 5-2 victory over Hibs in the League Cup earning the latest of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> 's eight.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Neil Lennon's men are the only side with three players to have earned two or more nominations, with only 18 players managing that feat across all four divisions this season.</p>
      <p>Raith Rovers forward Kieron Bowie - the youngest player in any of the XIs so far at just 17 - earned his second after scoring in his side's Challenge Cup victory over Glenavon at the weekend, while Ibrox youngster Jamie Barjonas was named for the first time, after helping Rangers Colts overcome Wrexham to reach the semi-finals of the competition.</p>
