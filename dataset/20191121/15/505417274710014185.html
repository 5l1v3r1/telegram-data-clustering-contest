        <b>Noel McNamara has confirmed that he will remain in his role as head coach of the Ireland U20s.</b>
      </p>
      <p>McNamara guided the side to a<a href="https://punditarena.com/rugby/smcmahon/ireland-u20-highlights-win-england/"> Grand Slam</a> title earlier this year in impressive fashion.</p>
      <p>The young Irish outfit went on to finish eighth at the World Rugby U20 Championship in Argentina, however, the side was decimated by injuries throughout.</p>

      <p>It was believed that McNamara would be stepping down from his role having come to the end of a two-year contract. He also signed on as Leinster’s Academy Manager in June which many thought would prohibit him from continuing in his current role.</p>
      <p>However, speaking to <a href="https://www.irishrugby.ie/2019/11/21/mcnamara-excited-for-third-season-in-charge-of-ireland-under-20s/">IrishRugby.ie</a>, McNamara confirmed that he will combine the two roles in 2020.</p>

      <p>“It’s a very exciting time,” he told IrishRugby.ie. “Any opportunity you get to work with a national team, particularly young players, it’s always something that should be relished with great enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think the two (jobs) are mutually exclusive. There is obviously an overlap between the two and ultimately I think it’s an advantage being involved in the system and getting the opportunity to work with a national side and benchmark players against the best in the world.</p>
      <p>“We’re really looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead.”</p>
