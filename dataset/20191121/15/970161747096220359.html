      <p>In 2017, the man emerged to people chanting his name to the tune of Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes. He walked with confidence and purpose. He was ready to fight.</p>
      <p>No, not <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jeremy-corbyn/">Jeremy Corbyn</a> on stage at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/glastonbury/">Glastonbury</a>. I mean Anthony Joshua taking to the ring to fight Wladimir Klitschko in the boxing battle of the decade.</p>
      <p>I’ll forgive your mistake, because as he delivered the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/jeremy-corbyn-says-hell-nationalise-mail-rail-water-energy-manifesto-launch-11194398/">Labour Party’s manifesto</a>, Corbyn had the same steel in his eyes, the same determination to fight – to leave with the victory that will define both his career and the country for (at least) the next five years.</p>
      <p>He was in Birmingham to promise ‘real change’.</p>
      <p>You see, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> wants to conserve the best of what has made this country great, while changing a few things to fix the problems we all face. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/labour-party/">The Labour Party</a> is about ripping up the status quo.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Team Red looks at the country and says it’s not great. There are billionaires here as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/food-banks-hand-out-record-breaking-numbers-of-emergency-parcels-11087866/">people use foodbanks</a>, and the system is broken. It needs fixing, not just fiddling at the sides. They want the ‘real’ change that Corbyn mentioned relentlessly.</p>
      <p>He knows that the ‘most powerful people in Britain and their supporters are going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible’.</p>
      <p>He knows that they are against his plans for change. He doesn’t care. He’s going to fight them: ‘They don’t own the Labour Party’.</p>
      <p>What better place to start than nationalisation?</p>
      <p>Right now, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/jeremy-corbyn-says-hell-nationalise-mail-rail-water-energy-manifesto-launch-11194398/">‘mail, rail, water and energy’</a> are run by big private companies.</p>
      <p>When they make money out of people who use them (and, let’s face it, we all use them), they take that money and give their bosses and shareholders bonuses and dividends.</p>
      <p>Take water, for example. In the five years to 2018, shareholders from the nine private companies made £6.5bn, while the bosses made £58m. That’s over seven billion pounds coming out of water into private bank accounts.</p>
      <p>Labour says this is wrong and it needs to end – now. Let’s nationalise these things, run them by the people for the people.</p>
      <p>When making money for bosses is removed, wonderful things can happen such as costs coming down. No need to exploit workers – instead, they get a better salary and happier staff then leads to an improvement of services.</p>
      <p>Not only does Jeremy Corbyn love all of this, but with this manifesto he’s shown that he’s prepared to fight for it.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He sees the resistance from the ‘bankers, the billionaires and the establishment’ who currently benefit from the privatisation and he shrugs – because, you know, they don’t own the Labour Party.</p>
      <p>Of course, the Conservative Party disagrees, and believes the system of competition, facilitated by the profit motive and the free market, makes everything more efficient and the services better for everyone.</p>
      <p>Sure, some people get rich, but isn’t that a price worth paying for excellent services? Private property is the cornerstone of capitalism.</p>
      <blockquote>Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour doesn’t want to use capitalism for anything</blockquote>
      <p>This is another reason why nationalisation is perfect for Labour. The party needs to get the companies – worth billions of pounds – back into state control. This will show people that the Government, Parliament and those entrusted with equality can take away ill-gotten gains of capitalists.</p>
      <p>This money has been made off the backs of people who have no choice but to buy. We can’t live without water, so that £7bn in five years? Every penny came from people paying their bills. Labour can do whatever is needed to create a more equal society.</p>
      <p>However, this is not a continuation of the Labour Party that was in government for 13 years. No, that was New Labour: Social Democrats, that believed in using capitalism to achieve socialist aims of equality.</p>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour doesn’t want to use capitalism for anything.</p>
      <p>This commitment to nationalise almost everything is reminiscent of Clause IV Labour, which called for public ownership of the ‘means of production, distribution and exchange’.</p>
      <p>Tony Blair took it out of the party’s constitution and while it hasn’t been put back, this party has more in common with the Labour of the past.</p>
      <p>The Labour of William Beveridge, Clement Atlee and Michael Foot. It’s old-fashioned, socialist Labour for 2020.</p>
      <p>And what does the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> say about all of this? It too echoes history.</p>
      <p>In 1992, the Conservatives’ poster said ‘Labour’s Tax Bombshell: You’d pay £1,250 more tax a year under Labour’.</p>
      <p>This year? They’re tweeting ‘£2,400’ more in tax per person per year under Corbyn’s Labour.</p>
      <p>Oh, and you remember those privatised industries that Corbyn predicted would fight him? They’re fighting him. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50499800">The energy industry has launched attack ads</a> on social media.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s people love it, this battle cry for socialism. This proud alignment with nurses, students, pensioners, tenants and young couples. This willingness to publicly call out those who will oppose him. This ‘them and us’ narrative.</p>
      <p>Once more for those at the back: ‘They don’t own the Labour Party.’</p>
      <p>They chant his name, they applaud him on their feet, they’re up for the fight – a lot like Wembley’s Anthony Joshua fans.</p>
