      <h2>Xstatic about these deals.</h2>

      <p>Microsoft's Black Friday sale has begun, which means massive savings for all you Xbox One owners out there. While you can head to our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-15-xbox-black-friday-deals-2019">Xbox Black Friday deals hub</a> for a giant list of great Xbox One deals, we also wanted to highlight the aptly titled Black Friday Game Deals sale.</p>
      <p>There are currently lots of great discounts on the Xbox marketplace, but be aware that you have to be an Xbox Live Gold member to avail yourself of the offers right now. The deals will be made available to everyone else on 24th November, and the sale runs right up to Monday 2nd December.</p>
      <p>We've had a poke around Phil Spencer's digital storefront and found some of 2019's best video games have been discounted by up to 50 per cent. Not too bad, eh?</p>
      <p>Remedy Entertainment's excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-23-control-review-mid-century-postmodernism">Control</a> is currently 35 per cent off the regular price, making it a steal at £32.49. Christian Donlan reviewed it back in August and said it was a combination of "giddy action and astonishing art," so it's safe to say we recommend you pick this up if you haven't already.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-08-need-for-speed-heat-review-a-slight-return-to-form-for-the-series">Need For Speed Heat</a>, which only launched two weeks ago, has also had its priced slashed; the deluxe edition of the Ghost Games racer is now on sale for £45.49, while the standard edition can be picked up for £38.99.</p>
      <p>Microsoft is basically giving away the terrific <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-06-devil-may-cry-5-review-an-unashamedly-old-school-retooling-of-an-action-classic">Devil May Cry 5</a>, flogging the Capcom slasher for a mere £14.84. If you're feeling a little more fancy you can grab the deluxe edition for £17.48. Go on, treat yourself.</p>
      <p>Other video games from 2019 that are worth a look include <a href="http://eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-17-rage-2-review-sparkling-combat-is-let-down-by-a-hollow-open-world">Rage 2</a>, which is a really fun shooter, despite an open world that didn't quite deliver; at £16.49, it's well worth your time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-01-mortal-kombat-11-review-the-complete-package-marred-by-a-soul-stealing-grind">Mortal Kombat 11</a> had some grinding problems when it launched, but it's still a fantastic fighter and a great deal at £27.49. And you owe it to yourself to have a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-27-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review-a-stripped-and-scarred-masterpiece">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>, which is on sale for £38.99.</p>
      <p>You can pick up some slightly older games, too, like the wonderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-08-hitman-2-review-a-surgical-to-the-point-of-slender-sequel">Hitman 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-09-19-dishonored-death-of-the-outsider">Dishonored Complete Collection</a>, which are both 70 per cent off at the moment.
