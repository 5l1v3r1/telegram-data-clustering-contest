      <p>CHICAGO, Nov 21 (Reuters) - China continued its purchases of U.S. soybeans, pork and beef even as negotiators struggled to hammer out details of the first phase of a potential trade deal between the two countries, according to government data released on Thursday.</p>
      <p>In its weekly export sales report, the U.S. Agriculture Department said that China agreed to buy 568,573 tonnes of soybeans in the week ended Nov. 14, down from 760,527 tonnes a week earlier. Soybean shipments headed to China during the week rose to 873,573 tonnes from 693,527 tonnes.</p>
      <p>The world's top oilseed purchaser has been a steady buyer of U.S. soybeans since the marketing year began on Sept 1., committing to buying 8.476 million tonnes as trade negotiations between the two countries have dragged on.</p>
      <p>That compares with just 647,990 tonnes during the same period of 2018 but was well below the 18.647 million tonnes it agreed to buy between September and mid-November of 2017 before the trade war began.</p>
      <p>China has also stepped up its purchases of U.S. pork and beef amid an outbreak of African swine fever that has devastated the country's hog herds and caused a protein shortage.</p>
      <p>USDA said that weekly pork export sales to China totaled 39,466 tonnes, with the bulk scheduled to be shipped in 2020. Beef export sales to China were 239 tonnes during the week. Pork shipments in the week came in at 12,979 tonnes and beef shipments were 1,134 tonnes.</p>
      <p>Completion of a phase one deal to end the trade fight could slide into next year, trade experts and people close to the White House told Reuters previously, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks and the U.S. administration counters with heightened demands of its own.</p>
      <p>But the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday it will strive to reach an initial trade agreement with the United States as both sides keep communication channels open.</p>
      <p>Chicago Board of Trade January soybeans were up 1-1/4 cents at $9.06-1/4 a bushel at 8:55 a.m. CST (1455 GMT), rebounding from the near eight-week low it hit overnight. (Reporting by Mark Weinraub Editing by Frances Kerry)</p>
