        <b>The Night Before Christmas in Wonderland</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Carys Bexington and Kate Hindley</b>
      </p>
      <p>‘Twas the night before Christmas… with a wonderful Wonderland twist!</p>
      <p>Lewis Carroll’s classic Wonderland returns but this time instead of Alice, it’s Santa’s turn for an adventure down the rabbit hole. Join the Cheshire-Cat, the Mad Hatter and the reindeer for a tea party with lots of festive rhyming fun.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Hearts hates Christmas… she has banned tinsel, mince pies and even good cheer because when she was a little princess, the White Rabbit was late delivering her letter to Father Christmas and she didn’t receive a present. But one snowy Christmas Eve, Santa finally receives her letter and races to deliver her gift! Will Santa and his reindeer be able to put the Merry back into Christmas in Wonderland?</p>
      <p>All the magic, nostalgia and spirit of kindness that mark out Christmas spring to life in this funny, thought-provoking book inspired by Carroll’s famous Wonderland poems and characters, and Clement C. Moore’s classic festive poem ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Written by debut author Carys Bexington, who has a soft spot for characters that don’t always make the best choices, and illustrated by star artist Kate Hindley, The Night Before Christmas in Wonderland embodies the true meaning of Christmas and will bring joy to all the family.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Amy Wilson</b>
      </p>
      <p>Inventive author Amy Wilson is proving that she certainly has the magic touch when it comes to children’s adventure stories.</p>
      <p>Shadows of Winterspell, a captivating story sparkling with frost and magic, is the extraordinary follow-up to the Branford Boase-longlisted novel A Girl Called Owl starring a girl who discovers her father is Jack Frost, A Far Away Magic which sees two troubled youngsters venture into a world of terrifying monsters, and Snowglobe, featuring a land of enchanted but sinister snowglobes.</p>
      <p>In her fourth wild and wonderful wintertime thriller, Wilson’s imagination moves into overdrive as she sweeps us away to a world of friendship and magic to uncover family secrets and find out who you really are.</p>
      <p>Stella has been living behind the magic of the forest for most of her life. Lonely and isolated, she enrols at the local school, and as she begins to make friends, she discovers that she is even more different than she thought. But as autumn turns to magical winter, Stella realises that uncovering her own family secret is the only way to release the forest from the grip of a dark and old magic. And it’s a journey that will bring her closer to humanity and the fae folk who live in the shadow-infested forest.</p>
      <p>Shadows of Winterspell is an enthralling and action-packed adventure, full of mystery and magic, but also a tender and insightful exploration of self-discovery, growing up and friendship, all perfectly attuned to the realities of modern day life.</p>
      <p>A wintertime winner that will capture the hearts and imaginations of middle-grade readers, and the perfect Christmas gift for your young adventurers!</p>

        <b>Chris Riddell</b>
      </p>
      <p>Step into a dazzling world of fairy tale wonders, intriguing mysteries, lovable heroes, unforgettable villains and skies filled with cloud horses as author and illustrator extraordinaire Chris Riddell works his special magic on a thrilling new children’s series.</p>
      <p>Guardians of Magic is the first book in The Cloud Horse Chronicles, a sumptuously presented and action-packed adventure series which sees former Children’s Laureate and Costa award winner Riddell at his imaginative best as three ordinary children discover that they have extraordinary gifts.</p>
      <p>The Kingdom of Thrynne is a place where fairy tales don’t behave and magic can be found in unexpected places. But magic also brings danger to three teenagers with special skills – apprentice baker Zam Zephyr, musician Phoebe Limetree, and orphaned daughter of a giant slayer, Bathsheba Greengrass.</p>
      <p>The future of magic is under threat from three powerful enemies and unless the three youngsters can fight back and believe in the impossible, soon magic and the cloud horses that nestle in the branches of the giant Forever Tree will be gone forever.</p>
      <p>Set against fantastical landscapes, and featuring witty and inventive twists on traditional fairy tales, Guardians of Magic stars an engaging cast of characters and is highly illustrated throughout in Riddell’s unique, rich and intricately detailed style.</p>
      <p>The perfect Christmas gift for all adventure-seekers!</p>

        <b>Marie Kondo and Salina Yoon</b>
      </p>
      <p>Renowned ‘tidying’ expert Marie Kondo brings her unique magic and neatness to Kiki and Jax, an enchanting picture book story about how tidying up can spark joy in the lives of young children.</p>
      <p>Kondo, star of Netflix’s hit show, Tidying Up With Marie Kondo, began her tidying consultant business as a nineteen-year-old university student in Tokyo and now she is an expert helping people around the world to transform their cluttered homes into spaces of serenity and inspiration.</p>
      <p>Kiki the squirrel and Jax the owl are best friends… Jax enjoys sorting but Kiki enjoys collecting and gathers a lot of stuff. Soon her home is full of things all over the place. Where is Kiki's ball, what did she do with her swimsuit? Her home has become an obstacle course and it’s hard for Kiki and Jax to play together. But Jax has a plan. He teaches Kiki how to sort everything and to keep only those things that spark joy. Once she and Jax have tidied up, Kiki has room in her life for those things that matter the most… especially her good friend Jax!</p>
      <p>Charmingly illustrated by the award-winning Salina Yoon, this entertaining and informative picture book is an easy-to-understand and accessible introduction to Kondo’s concept of tidying and includes a special, step-by-step folding activity to try out at home.</p>
      <p>Tidying away Christmas presents might prove to be fun for even the youngest of children this festive season!</p>
