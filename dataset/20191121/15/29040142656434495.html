      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Reno 3 will be the first OPPO phone to ship with ColorOS 7 and Android 10.</li>
        <li>OPPO's new ColorOS 7 will have a more subdued look and iconography.</li>
        <li>Application startup and other performance issues have been improved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OPPO has unveiled its upcoming <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oppo-announces-coloros-7-based-android-10/">flavor of Android 10</a>, the ColorOS 7 update. The new interface will ship first on the OPPO Reno 3 phone, for which OPPO offered few details other than dual-mode 5G support, important for the international market OPPO is hoping to target. Though the Reno 3 is rumored to run on decidedly mid-range chips, OPPO is touting performance enhancements throughout ColorOS 7. The new UI is also scheduled to hit a number of older OPPO devices.</p>

      <p>The new ColorOS 7 is a bit more <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/458/118.htm">muted and subdued</a> in its color scheme, though the themes are obviously customizable. There is a lighter feel to the OS, with rounded icons and softer colors. The OS will include new features like a Focus mode to limit distractions, as well as a new Flashback button that will act as a fast task switching feature to jump between recent apps. OPPO will also include a new password management tool with Google security built in.</p>

      <p>The camera app will get an upgrade to match today's favorite feature set, including improved night mode and video editing tools. The new OPPO Reno 3 phone is <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oppo-reno-3-price-specifications-tipped-features-leak-2129312">rumored to feature</a> four or more camera sensors, including a primary 60-megapixel rear camera and a 32-megapixel front-facing selfie cam. The phone has not been rumored to include OPPO's cool new <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oppo-gives-us-first-look-its-display-camera-tech">in-display camera</a> technology.</p>
      <p>OPPO will bring ColorOS 7 to a number of devices, including the flagship Reno phones as well as devices carrying the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/realme-3-pro-review">RealMe brand</a>. By the end of 2019, OPPO hopes to update the original Reno and Reno 2 devices, as well as the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oppo-reno-ace-teaser-highlights-90hz-amoled-display-65w-fast-charging">Reno Ace</a> and the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-review">Reno 10X Zoom</a>. More Reno, Find, and R devices will see updates in the first half of 2020, with Realme devices seeing ColorOS 7 and the new Android upgrade as early as February 2020.</p>
