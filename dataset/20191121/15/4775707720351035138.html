      <h3>Amazon is Reportedly Entering the Game Streaming Market to Rival Stadia and xCloud</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 21 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>Another internet giant is looking to enter the cloud game streaming market alongside Microsoft, Sony and Google. According to a report by <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/latest-black-friday-2019-deals-available-now-playstation-ps4-pro-dyson-vac-nintendo-switch-minecraft/">Cnet</a>, Amazon is rumoured to be launching its own video game streaming service next year.</p>

      <p>Amazon has reportedly been hiring talent from big game firms, including Microsoft, to help them with the launch. A job posting for a Principal Product Leader has been uncovered. In the posting, it details that the position is for a "new AWS gaming initiative" within the Amazon Web Services team, which is involved in Amazon's gaming service. Another job posting suggests that Amazon will integrate the service into its streaming platform Twitch, which kind of makes sense.</p>
      <p>Amazon has been exploring the games industry for a while now. It has its own development company called Amazon Games Studios which had mostly published games for the Amazon Web Store, and mobile, up until AGS published <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Grand-Tour-Game/achievements">The Grand Tour Game</a> this year on Xbox One and PS4. It also has a couple of games in development although they are yet to be announced. Earlier this year, AGS shut down multiple projects and laid off dozens of employees.</p>
      <p>Google recently launched its own streaming platform, Google Stadia, and has been met with widespread criticism. Latency issues, lack of players in multiplayer lobbies and the service simply not working have all been the main focal points about Stadia, it's been hard to find praise for the service. Microsoft's <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xcloud/games">Project xCloud</a>, which is in its preview phase, looks promising with <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39757/project-xcloud-playable-games">over fifty games currently playable</a>. We've been messing around with it in the office, unlocking a couple of achievements here and there. Although xCloud does suffer from some latency issues, the future is looking bright for it, providing Microsoft comes up with a sensible pricing plan to justify the service.</p>
      <p>At the moment, nothing has been confirmed by Amazon, but it would make sense that they would look into an avenue like this. It already owns the biggest streaming platform with Twitch, and integration between the two would be a logical move.<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/Rumour">Rumour</a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/Industry-News">Industry News<br/></a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39792/amazon-twitch-game-streaming#oMessages">View comments <br/></a><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0003474100/3474165.jpg" width="64" height="64"/><br/>Written by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey<br/></a>Hey everyone! I'm Sean. I have been writing gaming content for various outlets over the past few years while studying a degree in Journalism.
