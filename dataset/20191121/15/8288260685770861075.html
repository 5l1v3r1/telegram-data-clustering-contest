      <p>Aston Villa return to Premier League action - finally - when they welcome Newcastle United to Villa Park on Monday night (8pm).</p>
      <p>It seems an eternity since Villa played their last game, a 2-1 loss to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>, but the international break has come at an ideal time for Dean Smith's side to get their crocked stars back fit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Jack Grealish</a> - who has missed the past three matches in all competitions because of a calf strain - is back on the grass at Bodymoor Heath and likewise Jota, who has recovered from a hernia operation.</p>
      <p>Smith was hit with an injury crisis before and during the Molineux reverse last time out, first choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton, starting defender Bjorn Engels and Grealish missing out.</p>
      <p>Jed Steer - who replaced Heaton in goal - <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-news-steer-17257598">picked up a calf injury of his own just seven minutes</a> into the defeat to his side's West Midlands rivals while left-back Matt Targett came off in first half injury time because of a concussion.</p>

      <p><b>Last match:</b> Saturday, October 26 - Man City 3 Villa 0, 84 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Expected return date:</b> Newcastle (H), November 25.</p>
      <p><b>What Villa have said:</b> In an update on the <a href="https://www.avfc.co.uk/News/2019/11/13/injury-update">club's official site,</a> it was revealed that they hoped he would return to training at the back end of last week.</p>
      <p>A picture posted by Frederic Guilbert on Friday showed the Villa skipper in training, raising hopes of his availability for the game with the Magpies - <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-jack-grealish-17295212">the club have since released pictures on their Twitter account</a> of him on the Bodymoor Heath grass.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jack-grealish-boost-aston-villa-20916067">Reports in the national press</a> have suggested he is on course to make his long awaited return when Villa meet Newcastle United on Monday Night Football.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Bjorn Engels</h4>
      <p><b>Injury:</b> Hip</p>
      <p><b>Details:</b> The Belgian defender was a late omission from the travelling squad to Molineux. Engels picked up the injury in a training session.</p>
      <p><b>Last match:</b> Saturday, November 2 - Villa 1 - 2 Liverpool, 90 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Expected return date:</b> Newcastle (H), November 25.</p>

      <h4>Tom Heaton</h4>
      <p><b>Injury:</b> Calf</p>
      <p><b>Details:</b> Similarly to Engels, Heaton was expected to play at Molineux on Sunday, but was withdrawn from the squad after suffering a calf injury.</p>
      <p><b>Last match:</b> Saturday, November 2 - Villa 1 - 2 Liverpool, 90 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Expected return date:</b> Newcastle (H), November 25.</p>
      <p><b>What Smith has said:</b> "Tom Heaton's been struggling with a calf so I knew he was going to pull out of the game."</p>
      <p><b>What Villa have said: </b>Nyland, who finished the game at Molineux suggested that his colleague could be out for a matter of weeks, rather than days.</p>
      <p>"It has been suggested that Heaton should be out for two to three weeks."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Jed Steer</h4>
      <p><b>Injury:</b> Calf</p>
      <p><b>Details:</b> Steer started in goal due to Heaton's absence but only managed to play eight minutes before he was forced off. The goalkeeper hurt himself after attempting a save and Orjan Nyland was brought on. It was initially feared that he may have suffered an Achilles injury, although it is now understood to be a calf issue that could keep him out until the new year.</p>
      <p><b>Last match:</b> Sunday, November 10 - Wolves 2 - 1 Villa, 8 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Expected return date:</b> TBC</p>
      <p><b>What Smith has said:</b> "In the game, you get Jed Steer going down after three minutes on his first Premier League start with an Achilles injury but, for me, it still doesn't affect your desire to go and win a header, a tackle, a second ball and just help your teammates out and I didn't think we did that first half.</p>
      <p>"I'll wait for the prognosis on his Achilles injury."</p>
      <p><b>What Villa have said: "</b> Jed Steer was also forced off with a calf injury early on at Molineux. While the severity of the injury is still being assessed by the club’s medical staff, no timescale has been set for his return to training."</p>

      <h4>Matt Targett</h4>
      <p><b>Injury:</b> Head</p>
      <p><b>Details:</b> Targett was also taken off hurt against Wolves. The left-back was withdrawn with blurred vision after taking a knock to the head.</p>
      <p><b>Last match:</b> Sunday, November 10 - Wolves 2 - 1 Villa, 48 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Expected return date:</b> Newcastle (H), November 25.</p>
      <p><b>What Villa have said:</b> "Targett is set to return to training later this week after withdrawing from Sunday’s encounter at Wolverhampton Wanderers with a concussion.</p>
      <p>"In line with the game’s return to play protocols in the aftermath of a head injury of this nature, the full-back will follow a monitored and graduated return to action."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Jota</h4>
      <p><b>Injury:</b> Hernia</p>
      <p><b>Details:</b> Underwent surgery during the previous international break while uploading a photo from hospital following the successful op. Has recently posted a video of him sprinting with strength and conditioning coach Paddy Moore.</p>
      <p>Similarly to Grealish, he was seen on a social media post participating in first team training.</p>
      <p><b>Last match:</b> Wednesday, September 25 - Brighton 1 Villa 3, 90 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Expected return date:</b> After the international break.</p>
      <p><b>What's been said:</b> "Jota will be back joining training so we have got a lot of numbers coming back."</p>

      <h4>Keinan Davis</h4>
      <p><b>Injury:</b> Hamstring</p>
      <p><b>Details:</b> Substituted after 50 minutes of his third start of the season.</p>
      <p><b>Last match:</b> Wednesday, October 30 - Villa 2-1 Wolves, 50 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Expected return date:</b> Manchester United (A), December 1.</p>
      <p><b>What Smith has said:</b> "He's had a scan and he's got a hamstring injury. It's likely he'll be out for three to four weeks. The only good thing with that is that we've got an international period which can eat a few days into his injury. It's a blow because he's been doing well. He's been pushing Wes."</p>
