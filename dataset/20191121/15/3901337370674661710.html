      <h1>Rivaldo Talks Bafana Future After AFCON Debacle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:15:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>Rivaldo Coetzee says he is eager to return to the national setup following a debacle that could have very nearly ended his international career.</p>
      <p>The Mamelodi Sundowns versatile player had initially been called up for Bafana Bafana’s provisional squad for the Africa Cup of Nations tournament in June, but did not report for duty, with then coach Stuart Baxter suggesting ‘Riva’ had gone AWOL.</p>

      <p>Official word from his agent was that his mother was gravely ill at the time and the player had opted to look after him instead.</p>
      <p>This week, Coetzee was unwilling to comment on what exactly transpired, but did confirm a meeting with Baxter’s successor.  </p>
      <p>“I am focused on the club now. SAFA make the decisions and it’s up to them. If I comment on what happened in the past it might just jeopardise my chances of going back. But we have sorted things out and I have spoken to the new coach, Molefi Ntseki. He said some positives things to me and I can only take that into my game and get better,” said Coetzee.</p>
      <p>“This is my country, who wouldn’t want to play for their country? It is up to me now, whenever I get the chance to perform to the best of my ability and hopefully that will earn me a call-up. But I am focused on the club right now.”</p>
