      <p>This doctor has been hailed a hero after sucking the urine out of an elderly man.</p>
      <p>Zhang Hong used a catheter to extract 800ml of urine during a 37-minute incident on board an aeroplane.</p>
      <p>Zhang was on board a China Southern Airlines flight from Guangzhou to New York on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>While in mid-air, a passenger in his 70s suddenly suffered dysuria, a painful condition characterised by difficult and painful urination.</p>
      <p>Two passengers – Zhang and another man named Xiao Zhanxiang – came to the unnamed man’s aid.</p>

      <p>Xiao made a device with materials that were available onboard to try to help the elderly man urinate but it failed.</p>

      <p>Then Zhang decided to use a catheter to suck urine from the man and spat it out into a cup.</p>
      <p>After photos and videos of the incident circulated online, internet users in China praised the two doctors for their heroics.</p>
      <p>Zhang afterwards said he did not think much at the time because ‘saving people is the instinct of a doctor.’</p>
      <p>Zhang works for The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University (Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Hospital) while Xiao is attached Hainan Central Hospital.</p>
