      <p>During the game, Dhawan had suffered a cut on his knee and was taken to a hospital where he clicked selfies with the hospital staffs.</p>
      <p>Posting few images on Twitter, Dhawan wrote: "We Fall, We Break, but then... We Rise. We heal and we overcome, and the only thing you have control over is how you respond to any situation. Here's to being positive and happy in every situation that life throws at you. Will be back in action in 4-5 days."</p>
