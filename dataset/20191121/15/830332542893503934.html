      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Firefighters stopped a fire from breaking out in a downtown business at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, in part because of early detection by a smoke alarm.</p>
      <p>According to a release, a resident in the 300 block of North Randall Street woke up at 4:30 a.m. to the sound of an alarm and found the common area "very smoky." The resident called 911.</p>
      <p>Medic 4 and Engine Co. 1 arrived to find a haze of smoke in the building. Ladder Co. 1 accessed a downstairs business, finding two bags of oily rags. One of the bags was smoldering on the floor.</p>
      <p>Firefighters cooled the bag with a water can and then took the rags outside, the release said. Crews ventilated the building to clear the smoke and tenants were allowed to return inside, according to the release.</p>
      <p>The release said the smoke detector's early warning prevented the smoldering rags from igniting a fire, which could have caused significant damage and put lives at risk.</p>
      <p>The release reminds people to dispose of oily rags properly so they don't start a fire. It says that, if you have oily rags, never leave them in a pile, and dispose of dried rags in a metal container.</p>
