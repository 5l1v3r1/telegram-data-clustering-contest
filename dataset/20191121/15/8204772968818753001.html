      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Extinction+Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a> has distanced itself from its co-founder <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Roger+Hallam">Roger Hallam</a> after he made controversial remarks about the Holocaust.</p>
      <p>In an interview with German newspaper Die Zeit on Wednesday, Mr Hallam referred to the event, which claimed the lives of millions of Jewish people, as “just another f***ery in human history”.</p>
      <p>The environmental campaigner was discussing the launch of his new book when he made the comments.</p>
      <p>“The fact of the matter is, millions of people have been killed in vicious circumstances on a regular basis throughout history,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Hallam added that, when viewed in the context of atrocities, the Holocaust was “almost a normal event . . . just another f***ery in human history”.</p>
      <p>The environmental group “unreservedly” denounced Mr Hallam’s comments, with local branches posting on Twitter in support of the Jewish community.</p>
      <p>An Extinction Rebellion spokesman said: “Jewish people and many others are deeply wounded by the comments . . .</p>
      <p>“Internal conversations have begun with the XR Conflict team about how to manage the conflict process that will address this issue.</p>
      <p>“We stand by restorative outcomes as preferable, although in some cases exclusion is necessary.”</p>
      <h3>Arrest</h3>
      <p>Mr Hallam was arrested in September for allegedly attempting to cause disruption at Heathrow Airport using a drone.</p>
      <p>He is due to appear in court for a preparatory hearing on November 29th on charges of conspiracy to cause public nuisance, and a full trial is scheduled for February next year.</p>
      <p>His comments prompted a backlash on Twitter, including from Germany’s foreign minister <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Heiko+Maas">Heiko Maas</a>, who condemned Mr Hallam’s remarks about what he called the “uniquely inhumane” event.</p>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion also said: “Our 6th Principle states: we welcome everyone and every part of everyone working actively to create safer and more accessible spaces.</p>
      <p>“Our movement must be safe for Jews as well as all other minorities, marginalised peoples, and religious groups.</p>
      <p>“We stand in solidarity with XR <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Germany">Germany</a>, with Jewish communities, and with all those affected by the Holocaust, both in the past and in our times.” – PA</p>
