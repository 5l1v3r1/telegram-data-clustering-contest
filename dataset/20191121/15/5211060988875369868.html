      <p>TORONTO -- Police in Ontario are reminding the public to avoid dialing 911 to report non-emergency situations after a woman called to ask if she could get an “emergency ride service” to the train she was running late for.</p>
      <p>“Being late for a trip is never ideal,” officers with Peel Regional Police wrote in a tweet on Thursday morning. “Calling 911 to ask the police to act as an ‘emergency’ ride service, to get you there on time? Yeah… not gonna happen.”</p>
      <p>The conversation, which was posted in full in the tweet, started with the 911 operator asking if the caller needed assistance from police, fire or an ambulance.</p>
      <p>The caller then responded saying, “This is in terms of an officer… I’m supposed to have a trip to Union Station. The ride was supposed to show up for me this morning did not and I don’t know how you guys work with services in terms of that because I’m in a taxi right now but it’s not going to get me to the station on time for my train to board at 9:45 a.m.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/PeelPolice/status/1197529129568083969">conversation</a> then went as follows:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Operator: OK, I’m sorry so you’re in a taxi cab and you think you’re going to be late for your train ride at Union Station?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Caller: Yeah.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Operator: So what would you like an officer to do?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Caller: Do you guys offer emergency ride services or not?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Operator: An emergency ride service?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Caller: Yeah. I don’t know how you guys operate.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Operator: Well I can assure you we don’t do that.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Caller: My apologies.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Operator: You can call a cab or get in the cab and go to your appointment. OK?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Caller: OK. Thank you.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Operator: You’re welcome. Bye bye.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Peel Regional Police then wrote: “Only dial 911 if someone’s health, safety or property is in immediate danger or if there is a crime in progress." They also urged callers to dial 905-453-3311 for non-emergency situations.</p>
