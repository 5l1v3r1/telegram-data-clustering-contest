      <p>Myleene Klass only gave birth to her baby son Apollo three months ago, but she’s already making her way back to work.</p>
      <p>The little one had the pleasure of joining his mum to the office, as she was pictured making her way through London to the Smooth Radio studios.</p>
      <p>Snuggled up in a leopard print sling, the tot could be seen peering over the wrap as he looked up at the singer.</p>
      <p>And he is already a little fashionista, as he sported a pair of black and white Vans that were dangling on his feet.</p>
      <p>Our hearts are well and truly melted.</p>

      <p>Myleene was just as stylish as the tot, as she paired a black fedora and oversized sunglasses with a long duffle coat.</p>
      <p>After smiling at the cameras, the 41-year-old later revealed she had met up with Robbie Williams for a catch-up.</p>
