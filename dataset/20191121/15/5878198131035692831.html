      <p><a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/46-billion-thats-how-much-africans-in-the-west-sent-home-in-20181">Africa</a> is well-endowed with natural resources. Unfortunately, high levels of corruption amongst the political elites have forced many citizens to live below the poverty line.</p>
      <p>The World Bank, for instance, has warned Africa could be home to 90% of the world’s poor by 2030.</p>
      <p>That’ll be up from 55% in 2015 as governments across the continent have little desire to invest in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-09/africa-may-have-90-of-the-world-s-poor-by-2030-world-bank-says">poverty reduction programs</a>.</p>
      <p>“As countries in other regions continue to make progress in poverty reduction, forecasts suggest that poverty will soon become a predominantly African phenomenon,” said the World Bank.</p>
      <p>It is against this backdrop that <b>Face2face Africa</b> looks at five richest African leaders.</p>
