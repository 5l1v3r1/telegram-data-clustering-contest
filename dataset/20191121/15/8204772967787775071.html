      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=The+Cranberries">The Cranberries</a> have gotten their first Grammy nomination for their final album.</p>
      <p>The group’s In The End is up for best rock album at the 2020 awards.</p>
      <p>The album was released earlier this year, and features vocals recorded by lead singer Dolores O’Riordan before her death in January 2018.</p>
      <p>O’Riordan’s mother Eileen said the singer would have been thrilled to hear the band’s final album has been nominated for their first Grammy.</p>
      <p>Eileen O’Riordan said: “Dolores would be so happy with this, she put her heart and soul into her songs and music.</p>
      <p>“For us as her family it’s kind of bittersweet, we’re immensely proud yet saddened that she isn’t here to witness and enjoy this, although I feel that she is in spirit.”</p>
      <p>The Cranberries have said the album is a tribute to O’Riordan, who drowned in the bathtub of her London hotel room aged 46.</p>
      <p>Guitarist <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Noel+Hogan">Noel Hogan</a> said: “We wanted to finish this album for our dear friend and band-mate Dolores.</p>
      <p>“It’s a tribute to her, the band and our fans for the past 30 years.</p>
      <p>“Being honoured with this Grammy nomination has made this whole process even more special.”</p>
      <p>Drummer Fergal Lawler added: “We are extremely surprised and honoured to receive this Grammy nomination. We’re sure Dolores would be delighted.”</p>
      <p>The album was released in April by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=BMG">BMG</a>.</p>
      <p>After its release, The Cranberries said they planned to take a “step back” before deciding whether they had a future together without O’Riordan. – PA</p>
