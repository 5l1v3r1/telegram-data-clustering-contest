      <p>Taking to social media, Rosanna shared a sweet snap of her holding her daughter, and wrote: “And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true 💫.”</p>
      <p>“Today, November 21st 2019 at 11.57am, our beautiful and healthy daughter Sophia Rose Quirke arrived safely into the world weighing 6lbs8oz… she’s absolutely perfect 🙏🏼 .”</p>

      <p>The couple flew to an unknown country to welcome their daughter earlier this month.</p>
      <p><a href="http://goss.ie/showbiz/rosanna-davison-reveals-her-baby-is-due-today-190769">Their baby was originally due on November 15th</a>, but at the time, the couple said they felt they could be waiting a bit longer to meet their “little miracle.”</p>
      <p>Rosanna and Wes opted for surrogacy, after the model suffered multiple miscarriages.</p>

      <p>The former Miss World <a href="http://goss.ie/showbiz/rosanna-davison-reveals-she-blamed-herself-for-not-being-able-to-give-birth-190305">felt that she must be doing something wrong</a>, before she was diagnosed with an immune system disorder which explained why she had suffered miscarriages in the past.</p>
      <p>“Following medical advice, gestational surrogacy abroad became our only viable option for a biological child &amp; we’re so thankful for the wonders of modern medicine &amp; reproductive science,” she said.</p>
      <p>The couple will stay abroad with their little one for a few weeks, as they adjust to life as a family.</p>

      <p>During a recent interview with the Irish Mirror, Rosanna said: “We will stay there a few weeks I think, just because she will be brand new and we have to get her emergency passport and get various papers organised as well.”</p>
      <p>“But the nice thing is on her birth cert she is immediately ours, there is no mention of surrogacy, she’s an Irish citizen immediately so it has all worked out very well.”</p>
      <p>Congratulations to the happy couple!</p>
