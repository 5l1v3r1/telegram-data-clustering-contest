      <p>“Aligned with our strategy and values, ACRO has prioritised conversations around patient safety, privacy, and technology’s impact on clinical trials, and we are excited to join with ACRO and its member companies to support policy and investment that ensure safe and efficient trials for patients everywhere,” he added.</p>
