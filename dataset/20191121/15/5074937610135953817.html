      <p>“The Youth Challenge bootcamp ended with a judging process through which all the participating teams presented their efforts and five teams were selected to receive 1,000 USD seed funding and incubation support,” it said.</p>

      <p>The statement said generation unlimited was a multi-sector partnership established to support every young person aged 10-24 in bridging the transition from education and training to employment and entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>It said it brings together public and private partners – and young people themselves – to identify and capitalize on opportunities for shared-value partnerships and investments in strategies, models, initiatives, products and programs supporting outcomes for young people.</p>
