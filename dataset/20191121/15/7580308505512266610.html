      <p>Respected Nigerian musician, Innocent Ujah Idibia better known by his stage name, 2Baba Idibia has slammed the Nigerian system in a tweet on his Twitter page.</p>
      <p>The outspoken Nigerian entertainer who is known for speaking out about the ills and wrongs in the Nigerian society in his latest tweet is condemning the Nigerian system which he refers to as a joke.</p>
      <p>The singer’s tweet expresses his disappointment with the way the country is being governed by its leaders whom he refers to as criminals.</p>
      <p>He however maintains hope for the younger generation whom he prays can influence positive change to the decadent society that is Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Naija system is a total joke. Criminals have hijacked naija. Men and women that have dedicated their time 2 make sure that naija will carry last.. No shame. No dignity. No honor. I pray the young men that have entered the system will do their best to influence positive change.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Back in 2017, the hip-hop legend had organised a nation-wide protest against the Nigerian government to draw attention to the widespread suffering and deepening poverty in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Less than 48-hours to the planned protest, he released a video to announce that he is backing out of the protest. In the video, he claimed that his decision to cancel the protest was based on security fears that hoodlums might hijack the planned protest.</p>
      <p>Prior to the cancellation of the protest, the singer had been under pressure since announcing his plans for a nationwide protest in conjunction with a civil rights and democracy advocacy group called Enough is Enough Nigeria (EiE).</p>
      <p>Government officials had accused him of acting on behalf of corrupt politicians facing prosecution or the prospect of prosecution by the Muhammadu Buhari administration. Critics cited the car gifts he received from former Governor Godswill Akpabio of Akwa Ibom during Mr. Idibia’s wedding.</p>
