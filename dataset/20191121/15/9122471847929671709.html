      <h1>Report: Arkansas Coaching Candidate Is More Interested In Florida State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:33:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>While there are a plethora of programs focusing on the remaining games on their schedule, Arkansas’ football program is conducting its coaching search for next season.</p>
      <p>Arkansas fired Chad Morris before he could finish his season year as the head coach. He finished with an abysmal with a 4-18 record.</p>
      <p>The Razorbacks reportedly have their eyes on Memphis head coach Mike Norvell, but they won’t be the only Power Five program with interest.</p>
      <p>Norvell has already met with Arkansas for its job opening. However, the 38-year-old apparently is more intrigued by the opening at Florida State.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://footballscoop.com/news/update-at-arkansas/">FootballScoop.com</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Sources tell FootballScoop that Arkansas has met with Memphis head coach Mike Norvell. At this time Norvell is said to be more interested in the opening at Florida State than Arkansas; however we wouldn’t rule Norvell out of this one just yet.</blockquote>
      <p>Memphis is currently enjoying another strong season under Norvell as the team owns a 9-1 record.</p>
      <p>Norvell has led the program to 35 wins over the past four season. He’s one of the brightest offensive minds in college football, so it’s not too surprising that he’s a hot commodity on the coaching market.</p>
      <p>The Seminoles, meanwhile, <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/florida-state/florida-state-coaching-search-brian-kelly-interest">have also been linked to another big-name</a>.</p>
      <p>Leaving Memphis for Arkansas or Florida State would be quite the promotion for Norvell, but his resume warrants it.</p>
