      <h1>Cambridge University students cry fowl over 17th century painting that upsets vegetarians</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:36:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/anita-singh/" target="_blank">Anita Singh</a></address>
      <p>Some Cambridge University students might consider it a privilege to eat beneath a 17th century oil painting. But not if the students are vegetarian or vegan, and the work features animals bound for the dinner table.</p>
      <p>The Fowl Market, from the studio of the 16th century Flemish artist Frans Snyders, has been removed from the dining room of Hughes Hall following complaints that it was putting non-meat-eaters off their food. </p>
      <p>The painting features a collection of dead animals, including a swan, a boar, a deer and various game birds. </p>
      <p>It had been on long-term loan from the university’s Fitzwilliam Museum. After its return in December last year, it underwent conservation treatment and is about to go on display as part of a new exhibition, Fast &amp; Fast: The Art of Food in Europe, 1500-1800. </p>
      <p>A museum spokeswoman explained: “Some diners felt unable to eat because it was on the wall. People who don’t eat meat found it slightly repulsive. They asked for it to come down. </p>
      <p>“This exhibition makes the points that the debate about vegetarianism, about veganism, is nothing new. It dates back to the 1500s.” </p>

      <p>The exhibition curators, Victoria Avery and Melissa Calaresu, said the decision to take down the painting was a modern incarnation of historic concerns around food consumption and the environment.</p>
      <p>They said: “Many people are turning to vegetarianism and veganism as a political choice as much as a dietary one, as we rethink our relationship with animals and their treatment in an industrialised world.</p>
      <p>“Food choices are not only determined by political concerns about what we eat but also compounded by the moral anxieties which resonate around diet, self-image, over-consumption and our bodies. </p>
      <p>“As Feast &amp; Fast demonstrates, many of these contemporary concerns about our relationship with food are not new.” </p>
      <p>The show, which opens on Tuesday, will feature tableau including the recreation of a wedding ‘sugar banquet’, which consisted entirely of glittering displays made out of sugar, and an 18th century confectioner’s shop window. </p>
      <p>There will also be a recreation of a 17th century Baroque feasting table complete with swan and peacock. “While perhaps incredible - and indeed, offensive - to modern eyes, all of these birds and beasts were available for consumption by wealthy diners across early modern Europe, as made evident in Frans Snyders’ gigantic workshop copy of The Fowl Market,” the Fitzwilliam said.</p>
      <p>The Hughes Hall canvas was a mid-17th century copy by an unknown artist in the Antwerp workshop of Snyders (1579-1657), who is renowned for his still-life and animal subjects. The original is in the Hermitage in St Petersburg.</p>
      <p>The Fitzwilliam show features a wide range of food-related exhibits. Isaac Newton’s undergraduate notebook is included because in it he confesses to a love of marmalade and cake.</p>
      <p>There is a notebook belonging to John Evelyn, the 17th century naturalist, setting out his nine-step recipe for the perfect salad dressing.</p>
      <p> One object that has never been on public display before is a gingerbread woman mould of Mary II with her breasts exposed. The Fitzwilliam said: “It is an interesting piece to include because it shows that for female members of the Royal Family to be vilified in public is nothing new.”</p>
