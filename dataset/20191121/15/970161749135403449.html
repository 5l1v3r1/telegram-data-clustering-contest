      <p>The Crown’s third season may have just dropped on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> – but fans are already looking forward to the fourth installment.</p>
      <p>Among the new arrivals expected for the new series – which is filming now – are Princess Diana herself and Gillian Anderson’s much-touted turn as former PM Margaret Thatcher.</p>
      <p>Star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/olivia-colman/">Olivia Colman</a> has already raved about The X-Files<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/the-crowns-olivia-colman-gives-verdict-on-gillian-anderson-as-margaret-thatcher-in-season-4-11167818/"> actress’ ‘brilliant’ transformation into The Iron Lady</a> and now the creator and writer of the show, Peter Morgan has spoken about what we can expect when she turns up.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.somethinelse.com/projects/the-crown-the-official-podcast/">The Crown podcast</a>, Morgan made an interesting point about how the Queen’s relationship to each successive Prime Minsister can be seen through a familial prism.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve always found it useful when thinking about her relationship with those men [prime ministers] to think of them in family terms,’ the writer said.</p>

      <p>‘Churchill was a grandfather as a paradigm. And then Macmillan very much a father. And then you move through all the prime ministers and you get to someone like Blair, who would have been the first son.’</p>
      <p>And of course, the Oscar-nominated scribe teased that another ‘paradigm’ shift will occur when the Queen meets the first female PM.</p>

      <p>‘[Thatcher] is a twin. They were born just six months apart. They’ve got an awful lot in common, not least their gender.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘Sometimes the things that you think will bring two people together actually drives them apart.’</p>
      <p>Sounds very dramatic, are we sure he’s not talking about House of Cards instead of The Crown?</p>
      <p>There’s already a look to forward to in the fourth season – not least the now-mythical arrival of the future Princess Diana into the royal circle.</p>
      <p>The icon will be played by actress Emma Corrin – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/crowns-josh-oconnor-teases-prince-charles-heartache-princess-diana-introduced-season-4-11188088/">who has already been praised by co-star Josh O’Connor</a>, who plays Prince Charles.</p>
      <p>Corrin has already been snapped in action and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/the-crown-season-4-photos-floor-fans-as-emma-corrin-is-identical-to-princess-diana-10880225/">she looks eerily like the late, beloved princess</a> during the couple’s 1983 tour of Australia.</p>
