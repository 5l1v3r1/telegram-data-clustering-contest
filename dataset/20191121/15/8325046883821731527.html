      <p>A cold can really start a fuss, especially when a baby catches it.</p>
      <p>Each year in the US, the common cold infects more people than any other illness, and infants and children are especially susceptible. Here’s what you need to know if your baby has caught a cold.</p>
      <h4>How long does a cold last in babies?</h4>
      <p>Symptoms for a cold will typically last 7 to 10 days in infants and children. Common cold symptoms to watch out for in your baby include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-clear-a-stuffy-nose">Stuffy</a> or <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-get-rid-of-a-runny-nose">runny nose</a></li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Another way to tell is that: “You’ll notice them getting fussier,” says <a href="https://www.texaschildrens.org/find-a-doctor/julieana-nichols-md">Julieana Nichols</a>, MD, an associate professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital.</p>
      <p>There’s no concrete <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-long-does-a-cold-last">timeline for cold symptoms</a> in babies because it varies from one baby to the next. But generally, a baby will develop a fever within the first three days of illness.</p>
      <p>Their symptoms will probably peak and become the worst on days two and three. After that, by day four symptoms tend to improve. But the cough may linger beyond day 10.</p>
      <p>Babies can sometimes catch up to eight colds a year. Nichols says the number depends on how often the baby is exposed to other children who may be sick. For example, babies who attend daycare may catch the cold six to eight times a year, while babies who don’t tend to have fewer colds, about two or three.</p>
      <h4>How to help a baby with a cold</h4>
      <p>Usually, the best course of action is to wait for the cold to go away and manage symptoms in the meantime. Parents can use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A humidifier to ease <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-clear-a-stuffy-nose">stuffy</a> or <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-get-rid-of-a-runny-nose">runny</a> noses.</li>
        <li>Saline nose drops can thin mucus, which should then be removed with a bulb syringe.</li>
        <li>To relieve discomfort related to a fever, acetaminophen pain relievers, like Tylenol, is safe if your baby is between 3 and 6 months old (for babies 6 months and older, you can provide ibuprofen).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But for children younger than 2 years old, avoid over-the-counter cough and cold medications that contain a decongestant or antihistamine. Common brands include Mucinex Children’s Stuffy Nose and Chest Congestion and Children’s Dimetapp Cold and Allergy.</p>
      <p>That’s because it’s unclear what the right dose is for babies at this age, and overdoses can cause “convulsions, rapid heart rates, and death,” according to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/use-caution-when-giving-cough-and-cold-products-kids">FDA</a>. Overdoses have been more common than you might guess.</p>
      <p>In 2004-05, more than 1,500 US children younger than age 2 went to the emergency room for side effects related to overdoses from cough and cold medications.</p>
      <h4>When to take your baby to a doctor for the cold?</h4>
      <p>While colds typically go away on their own, a baby may need to visit the pediatrician if unusual symptoms develop.</p>
      <p>According to Nichols, parents should seek medical care if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A baby younger than 2 months has a fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>The baby is older and has a fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>A cough worsens after day 10.</li>
        <li>The baby is vomiting to the point they’re urinating less.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And if your baby isn’t exhibiting these warning signs but you’re still worried, call your pediatrician.</p>
