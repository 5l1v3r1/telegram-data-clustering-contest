      <h1>Road accident death increases to 1,915 in 2019 - Minister</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:52:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author">Kodjo Adams, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 20, GNA - The country recorded 11,342 road crashes for the nine months to October, resulting in 1,915 deaths.</p>
      <p>This compared to 1,921 deaths recorded for 2018.</p>
      <p>Mr Daniel Nii Kwartei Titus Glover, the Deputy Minister of Transport, who announced this, said out of the total number of 11,342 crashes, 2,418 were pedestrians knock downs and 11,520 involved injuries.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the total crashes were 11,159 with 11,130 injuries and 2,606 pedestrian knock downs.</p>
      <p>The deaths were due to indiscipline and disrespect for road regulations in relation to driving above speed limits, driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, wrong overtaking and refusal to use seatbelts.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Minister said this on Tuesday at the launch of the 2019 Road Safety Christmas Campaign at the Kaneshie Transport Terminal in Accra on the theme: “Stop Road Accident Now before It Stops You”.</p>
      <p>The campaign is aimed at reminding Ghanaians especially motorist and pedestrians to be road safety conscious before and after the Christmas festivities.</p>
      <p>As part of the campaign, there will be vigorous outreach programmes from December 5 to January 7, 2020 with personnel from the National Road Safety Authority (NRSA) on major roads, transport terminals, schools and public places for education on safe road use.</p>
      <p>Mr Glover said the deaths could have been prevented if road users had exercise self-discipline and demonstrated responsibility for safe road use practices and compliance with existing road traffic regulations.</p>
      <p>He said government was not enthused about the situation and was committed to introducing reforms in the areas of legislations, institutional and logistical capacity to help curb the menace.</p>
      <p>“As part of the reforms, the National Road Safety Commission has been transformed into a regulatory body to enhance its mandate to enforce institutional standards for road safety related activities and issue appropriate sanctions  for non-compliance”,, he added.</p>
      <p>He said the Ministry was collaborating with the Motor Traffic and Transport Department of the Ghana Police Service to scale-up enforcement activities on the provisions of the Road Traffic Regulations in relations to travel speeds, drink driving, jay-walking and use of foot bridges.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Minister urged drivers to exercise restraint and to adhere to road traffic regulations, while pedestrians must be alert when walking along or crossing the road and speak up against drivers who misbehave when driving.</p>
      <p>Mrs May Obiri Yeboah, the Director General, NRSA said the campaign was to heighten sensitization for safer use of the road by all categories of road users before, during and after the Christmas and New Year festivities.</p>
      <p>She urged the public to support the campaign because road safety is a shared responsibility and there is the need to exhibit good behavioral change towards the safety on the roads.</p>
