      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge has cancelled an appearance at an awards ceremony due to an undisclosed matter relating to her children.</p>
      <p>Kate was due to join husband William at the Tusk Conservation Awards event in London on Thursday evening, but pulled out just a few hours ahead of its start.</p>
      <p>Kensington Palace said the Cambridges would be meeting the finalists during the afternoon, suggesting the children’s health was not the reason behind the cancellation.</p>
      <p>A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said: “The duchess is no longer able to attend the Tusk awards due to the children.</p>
      <p>“She will still however meet finalists at a tea at Kensington Palace this afternoon. The duke as patron will attend both.”</p>
      <p>The duke and duchess have three children, eldest son Prince George, aged six, daughter Princess Charlotte, aged four, and their youngest child Prince Louis, who is almost 19-months-old.</p>
