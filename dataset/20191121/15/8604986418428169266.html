      <h1>How to Choose Between Crowdfunding and Angel Investors for Your Startup</h1>
      <h2>Crowdfunding is hot, but it doesn't fit every situation. Don't forget professional investors as a good alternative.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:34:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Zwilling</a></address>
      <p>With the advent and popularity of <a href="https://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/heres-what-you-can-learn-about-crowdfunding-backers-based-on-recent-data.html">crowdfunding</a> platforms, including <a href="https://www.inc.com/alex-daly/playbook-crowdfunding-indiegogo-or-kickstarter.html">Kickstarter and Indiegogo</a>, as a winning alternative for funding your new venture, I find that many aspiring entrepreneurs are confused about the need to ever seek a professional <a href="https://www.inc.com/todd-vernon/the-five-types-of-angel-investors.html">angel investor</a>.</p>
      <p>I think it's great to have more options, but I still see each one having a place, so don't be too quick to limit your alternatives.</p>
      <p>To refresh your memory, angel investors are typically high-net-worth individuals accredited by the <a href="https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/sec-disclosure-laws-and-regulations.html">SEC</a> and willing to invest their own money in a high-potential startup for a share of the ownership. See the popular TV show <i><a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201411/leigh-buchanan/how-to-impress-mark-cuban-and-the-other-judges-on-shark-tank.html">Shark Tank</a></i> for a glamorized version of how they work and what to expect in negotiation. In the real world, most angels are regular business people like you and me.</p>
      <p>Crowdfunding, on the other hand, opens the investment door online to almost anyone who is willing to bet on a new product or service with an investment, typically for a chance to be first in line for the offering, and willing to forgo any equity or management position in the company.</p>
      <p>In my role as a small-business consultant and mentor to many entrepreneurs, I recommend the following key considerations for the best strategy to pursue for outside funding, if you choose not to fund the business yourself:</p>
      <h3>1. Consider that consumer products and trends need market validation</h3>
      <p>If your new startup is addressing a consumer need, such as a new gadget or food service, then crowdfunding response can give you the ultimate validation of a large-scale market, as well as full funding.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, with minimal response from the crowd, you may need to rethink your business plan.</p>
      <p>For example, many of you remember the Pebble Smartwatch, which raised over $20 million and made crowdfunding real. Yet overall more than <a href="https://www.inc.com/martin-zwilling/8-reality-checks-for-your-next-crowdfunding-campaign.html">two-thirds of crowdfunding campaigns</a> do not meet their monetary goal and have to return anything they do collect.</p>
      <h3>2. Know that business-to-business products need professional investors</h3>
      <p>If your target customer is a business, rather than a consumer, I recommend you skip crowdfunding. This is the realm of the angel investor, who wants to own a piece of the new business, and probably knows how to run it and wants a seat on the board.</p>
      <p>For B2B startups, every investor expects to see a proven business model, with a working prototype and preferably a real customer or two. They don't get excited by early-stage research, development, or marketing hype. Crowdfunding is not the best platform here.</p>
      <h3>3. Consider the need for multiple rounds of funding</h3>
      <p>Most startups need more money than they anticipated, to grow and expand their business, after development and rollout.</p>
      <p>Professional investors understand this need, and are prepared to support it, unless crowdfunding was the first round. Investors are very wary of unknown owners and valuation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/sonya-mann/facebook-second-quarter-earnings.html">Facebook</a>, for example, may seem like a reasonably simple consumer application. Yet it required 14 rounds of investment, totaling many millions, before it became profitable enough to fund its own growth and reach a current market valuation of over $500 billion.</p>
      <h3>4. Compare the time frames and costs of alternatives</h3>
      <p>In most cases, a crowdfunding campaign can be rolled out more quickly, and earlier in the development cycle, than a campaign to find professional investors.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, crowdfunding platform fees cost more than finding investors, as much as 5 to 10 percent of the money you need.​ </p>
      <h3>5. Know that early visibility can be a curse or a blessing</h3>
      <p>For very competitive environments and disruptive products, you may want to limit your visibility before a high-profile rollout. You can do this by targeting specific investors, with nondisclosure agreements, but crowdfunding will require early and broad public marketing efforts of your time frame. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, early marketing may increase your brand's acceptance, and the crowdfunding platform may be the low-cost way to spread the word. If your campaign is funded quickly and generously, this also sends a very positive message to customers. </p>
      <p>In reality, the most successful funding decision I still see is bootstrapping, or self-funding. Even today, the majority of successful businesses are bootstrapped or funded in the initial stages by the founders or bank loans rather than outside cash injections.</p>
      <p>The smart entrepreneurs I see evaluate all the alternatives, and pick the one that makes the most business sense for them.</p>
