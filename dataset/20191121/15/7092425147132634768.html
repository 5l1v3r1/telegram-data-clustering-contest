        <b>Netflix has just dropped a new true crime documentary and people are absolutely raving about it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The film, titled <i>Dream/Killer</i> landed on Netflix yesterday and focuses on a case represented by none other than Kathleen Zellner — the powerhouse lawyer that has taken over Steven Avery's case.</p>
      <p>Dream/Killer is based on a man who took on the US justice system after his son Ryan was sentenced to prison for a murder he claimed not to have committed.</p>
      <p>In the 2015 documentary, Bill Ferguson took on the judiciary, alongside his attorney Kathleen Zellner, who became an international sensation when she feature in season two of hit docs-series Making a Murderer.</p>
      <p>We don't want to give too much away so as not to spoil the movie for you but here's the basic outline.</p>
      <p>The film investigates the 2001 murder Kent Heitholt, who was found dead in his work car park and had been strangled with his own belt.</p>

      <p>Two years after his death, the case was still unsolved but police were offered a fresh lead after an anonymous call tipped them off to a local man called Charles 'Chuck' Erickson.</p>
      <p>Chuck was said to have been high on drugs and had met his 17-year-old friend Ryan Ferguson at about 10.30pm but he said he couldn't remember anything else afterwards.</p>
      <p>During a police interview, footage of which was shown in the film, Erickson incriminated himself and his friend Ryan in the murder. Ferguson was later picked up by the FBI.</p>
      <p>He later claimed: "I'm innocent of even being there. I'm not involved in this, in any way."</p>
      <p>However, state prosecutor Kevin Crane issued a statement revealing Erickson was being charged with murder in the second degree, and Ferguson was being charged with murder in the first.</p>
      <p>There was no physical evidence linking either one of them to the crime.</p>
      <p>The documentary has been receiving rave reviews from true crime fanatics, with some claiming it is the best they've ever watched.</p>
      <p>Sure to be honest, we'd watch a film about paint drying if Kathleen was in it.</p>
