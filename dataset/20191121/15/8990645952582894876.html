      <p>The efforts by the city to be more bicycle-friendly have been officially recognized by the <a href="https://www.bikeleague.org/">League of American Bicyclists</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier today it was announced that Wichita Falls had been honored with the Bronze-level Bicycle Friendly Community (BFC) award.</p>
      <p>From a statement released by the City of Wichita Falls:</p>
      <blockquote>"Communities like Wichita Falls are leading the nation when it comes to important livability factors that people want where they call home, like safe and accessible places to bike,” said Bill Nesper, Executive Director of the League of American Bicyclists. Wichita Falls joins 53 new and renewing Bicycle Friendly Communities as part of a movement toward more vibrant, healthy, sustainable and connected places. Our nation and globe are facing complex public health and road safety challenges, and we’re proud that Wichita Falls and communities like it are embracing bicycling.”<br/><br/>Stephen Santellana, Mayor of Wichita Falls said, “Prioritizing and creating a bicycle friendly community has been a goal in City Council’s Strategic Plan and the city-wide Economic Development Strategy. We are excited to see that goal achieved today. This is an honor for Wichita Falls to be awarded a Bronze-level Bicycle Friendly Community Award. Cycling has helped shaped our community and is a source of pride for our citizens. There are only eleven other cities in the state of Texas that have the BFC designation. This award will further aid in establishing Wichita Falls as a true cycling community.”</blockquote>
      <p>The public is invited to attend the formal award ceremony in the chambers during the City Council meeting on Tuesday, December 3rd at 8:30 am.</p>
