      <p><b>Best</b> MacBook for Teachers iMore 2019</p>
      <p>Apple MacBooks have always had a place in classrooms thanks to their overall power and durability.

      <p>The entry-level MacBook Air offers a 13-inch Retina display with True Tone, 1.6GHz dual-core 8th-generation Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz, 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory, 128GB SSD storage, Intel UHD Graphics 617, and Touch ID. At 2.75 pounds, the 2019 MacBook Air is the lightest MacBook currently on the market. It's also the least expensive.</p>
      <p>The lower price comes with drawbacks, starting with having an older and slower processor and less robust graphics card than the 13-inch MacBook Pro. It also contains fewer Thunderbolt 3 ports than most of the MacBook Pro models. On a positive note, the MacBook Air offers two more hours of use between charges than the similar-sized MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>Despite limitations, we recommend this model above all others for teachers, unless you're a creative who plans on using your laptop for intense video and photo work. It's a great laptop at a terrific price.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Same screen size as 13-inch MBP</li>
        <li>Up to 12 hours of wireless web between charges</li>
        <li>Price</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Only two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports</li>
        <li>Not as powerful as MBP models</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Overall</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>Fun, yet practical</p>
      <p>The best all-around option for teachers, the MacBook Air is a great looking device that will provide you with years of service.</p>

      <h3>Best Alternative: 13-inch MacBook Pro (2019)</h3>

      <p>When it comes to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, $500 separates the base and most complete package. Add more memory, storage, and a better processor, and the price can jump even more. Despite this, the smaller of the two MacBook Pro models has a lot going for it.</p>
      <p>At just over three pounds, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is only slightly heavier than the MacBook Air. For this, you receive a better processor and graphics card, more storage availability, and a Touch Bar. On the downsize, adding an even better graphics card or more storage suddenly pushes this model past the $2,000 mark, which might make you reconsider buying a 13-inch versus 16-inch model.</p>
      <p>If you're comfortable with the 13-inch screen size and less concerned with price, you should buy this model over the MacBook Air.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Better internals than MacBook Air</li>
        <li>Great mobility</li>
        <li>Much cheaper than the 16-inch model</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You can't upgrade the graphics card</li>
        <li>Price can rise quickly as you add components</li>
        <li>Is 13-inches enough?</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Alternative</h4>

      <p>A step up</p>
      <p>There's much to love about this model, which offers better internals than the MacBook Air.</p>

      <p>The least expensive 16-inch MacBook Pro model packs a punch, offering a 9th-generation Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz. The base 16-inch MacBook Pro comes with 16GB 2666MHz DDR4 memory, 512GB SSD storage, and four Thunderbolt 3 ports. The model comes standard with an AMD Radeon Pro 5300M with 4GB of GDDR6 memory graphics processor and can be upgraded to AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 4GB of GDDR6 (for an extra $100) or AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 8GB of GDDR6 ($200) for better performance.</p>
      <p>On the obvious downside, this is an expensive laptop. Plus, you'll need to recharge this laptop more often than the MacBook Air. And like all MacBooks, it isn't usually on sale at a discount.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The least expensive 16-inch model</li>
        <li>Pay only $100 extra for a graphics boost</li>
        <li>Biggest MacBook Pro display to date</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Still very expensive</li>
        <li>Not the most powerful MBP you can buy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can elect to go with the 16-inch MacBook Pro with an 8‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i9 processor and Turbo Boost up to 4.8GHz. For this, you'll receive a graphics card boost and 1TB of storage versus the 512GB of storage found on the base model. If this isn't enough, you can add more memory, an even better graphics card, and more storage. In doing so, the cost of this model can quickly exceed nearly $6,000. Also, keep in mind this is the first 16-inch MacBook Pro released. Don't be surprised if a significantly refreshed model arrives in 2020.</p>
      <p>However, if you're a teacher looking to run video and photo apps, this is almost certainly the one you should buy. Just think carefully before adding extras.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple's best MacBook Pro to date</li>
        <li>Graphics boost, upgrades</li>
        <li>Up to 64GB of memory available</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Most expensive MacBook Pro on the market</li>
        <li>First-generation 16-inch model.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best for Creatives</h4>

      <h3>Bottom line</h3>
      <p>In 2019, the MacBook lineup shrunk after Apple discontinued the 12-inch MacBook. The change brings to four the number of Apple laptops we recommend for teachers. Our favorite, the <a href="https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F159229%2F554233%2F7613%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU55547YYw%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.apple.com%252Fshop%252Fbuy-mac%252Fmacbook-air&amp;token=X5muhNN-">13-inch MacBook Air</a>, is the best choice for most teachers. It offers a Retina display with True Tone, 1.6GHz dual-core 8th-generation Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz, 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory, 128GB SSD storage, Intel UHD Graphics 617, and Touch ID.</p>
