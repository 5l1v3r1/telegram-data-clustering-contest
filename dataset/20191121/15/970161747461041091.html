      <h1>Student thought she was tired because of exam stress actually had ovarian cancer</h1>

      <p>Anna Maria Szalay was studying for her university exams, as well as working a part-time job and finishing up her coursework.</p>
      <p>She thought that was the reason she was always tired. But just a few months later, she was told that it was actually because she had ovarian cancer at just 19.</p>
      <p>She tells Metro.co.uk: ‘The symptoms of ovarian cancer aren’t very well known so I never thought about anything like that. I thought it was just university stress.’</p>
      <p>Anna Maria was in the second year of her law degree at Oxford Brookes University when started feeling unwell around September 2017 – but with so much going on, she initially put off going to the doctor, thinking it was nothing serious.</p>
      <p>In December, as she started to feel worse, she went to see her GP but it took three visits before she was referred on – something that is common with ovarian cancer symptoms.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Ovarian Cancer Action found that on average it takes a woman eight visits to the GP to be diagnosed.</p>
      <p>It was particularly difficult for Anna Maria because of her age – <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/ovarian-cancer/incidence?utm_source=affiliate_window&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_name=online_retail&amp;utm_content=www.google.com&amp;awc=2584_1574349591_6a5acd2fcfd8929f320dac9f95ab9dd1&amp;dclid=CjgKEAiAiNnuBRCkm978_r-wyGsSJAB5-gM7ES3Vsld2zobUNLcVgq1-T7WeHNAAGhhqWXpoPBpl6fD_BwE#heading-One">according to Cancer Research</a>, just two in 100,000 people between the ages of 15 and 19 are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year.</p>
      <p>Anna Maria says: ‘I was brushed off numerous times. That’s common with lots of people but I think particularly because I was so young. It can spread quite quickly so it’s important that it is caught early.’</p>
      <p>By then, Anna Maria also had persistent bloating, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements but admits that she didn’t realise they were all things that show it could be ovarian cancer because they are symptoms for so many things.</p>

      <p>The third GP she saw told her to trust her instincts that something was wrong because we know our bodies better than anyone.</p>
      <p>She was referred for a blood test and scan, which showed that she had a mass on her ovary. Doctors told her that they thought it was cancerous but they wouldn’t know how advanced it was until she had surgery to remove it.</p>
      <p>‘I knew something was wrong but I just didn’t ever think it would be cancer so it was a huge shock to the system,’ she says.</p>
      <h3>What are the symptoms of ovarian cancer?</h3>
      <p>The four main symptoms are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent stomach pain</li>
        <li>Persistent bloating</li>
        <li>Difficulty eating/feeling full more quickly</li>
        <li>Needing to wee more frequently</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ovarian cancer symptoms might also include back pain, changes in bowel habits (going more often or a lot less), and extreme tiredness for no obvious reason.</p>

      </p>
      <p>‘The whole process between starting to experience symptoms and having surgery took less than six months so it just shows how quickly it can spread.’</p>

      <p>She had the surgery on 22 January 2018 to remove it that they told her it was stage three.</p>
      <p>Two weeks later, she had an intensive course of chemotherapy which led to complications.</p>
      <p>Anna Maria added: ‘Chemotherapy was really tough. I developed sepsis and had blood clots and it was just really hard to go through.’</p>

      <p>Cancer had a huge impact on Anna Maria’s life and because of the gruelling treatment, she was forced to withdraw from the university.</p>
      <p>Before starting treatment she tried to talk to university staff about her options but says that she eventually felt she had no choice but to leave.</p>
      <p>Anna Maria wanted to continue studying but with lots of medical treatment and the effects of treatment, it meant she had to miss classes.</p>
      <p>She says: ‘My doctors told me that I wouldn’t be able to do this. I couldn’t have chemotherapy and keep studying.</p>
      <p>‘I felt there wasn’t an awful lot of support and when I told them I wanted to withdraw, it was the same process as withdrawing to go on holiday.</p>
      <p>‘The university said it was a personal choice for me to withdraw and I had to get my doctor to write a letter saying I didn’t choose it. It was really upsetting.’</p>
      <p>But in May 2018, she had her last dose of chemotherapy. The treatment had been successful and she was now in remission.</p>
      <p>She adds: ‘I do have that fear of it coming back. I have checkups every two months and the longer I stay in remission, the further apart those will get.’</p>

      <p>Now doing better, Anna Maria reapplied for university after finishing treatment and decided to start at a new university, moving away from Oxford, where she had grown up and studied before cancer.</p>
      <p>She says: ‘I decided I wanted to start afresh. I felt there wasn’t an awful lot of support before. For that reason, I wanted a fresh page in a new place after I finished treatment.’</p>
      <p>She’s now studying law with business and management at the University of Sussex and says she is very happy there.</p>

      <p>She adds: ‘There is an amazing support system in place here. I felt like it had lots of reminders of life before cancer so I wanted to go somewhere new.</p>
      <p>‘Now I am enjoying having a normal life again.’</p>
      <p>Anna is speaking out as part of an <a href="https://ovarian.org.uk/">Ovarian Cancer Action</a> campaign to raise awareness and fund research.</p>
      <p>The campaign is centred around a video with the voice of Kate Winslet, who lost her mum to the disease in 2017.</p>
      <p>The video, with music by Birdy, aims to encourage women to trust their instincts and to go to the GP if they worry that something is wrong.</p>
      <p>It highlights that one woman dies of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK.</p>

      <p>Anna Maria adds: ‘There is so little awareness for ovarian cancer. We need more research, prevention and treatment.</p>
      <p>‘Many GPs are amazing but ovarian cancer is being misdiagnosed as less serious conditions so I want women, their families and their doctors to know and understand the symptoms.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘If you are worried, don’t be scared to go to the doctor and say that it is an issue.’</p>
      <p>Cary Wakefield, CEO of Ovarian Cancer Action, said: ‘For many years ovarian cancer has been overlooked and underfunded. It’s a cancer that takes the life of a woman every two hours here in the UK, and early diagnosis can be the difference between life and death.</p>
      <p>‘Today less than a third of women are diagnosed before their cancer spreads, where treatment becomes harder and chance of survival becomes low. But we can change this. Investing in research now could produce a reliable screening tool, better treatments, and will transform the lives of the next generation. If we act now, they will survive.’</p>

      <p>Addressing Anna Maria’s concerns about withdrawing from the university, a spokesperson for Oxford Brookes said: ‘While the university will not comment on individual cases, the wellbeing and care of our students is of utmost importance and we are committed to offering a range of support and services.</p>
      <p>‘The University’s Exceptional Circumstances Policy is designed to ensure that students are not unfairly disadvantaged when experiencing circumstances beyond their control.</p>
      <p>‘Any student experiencing difficulties also has access to support which includes Wellbeing services, Student Support Coordinators, Academic Advisers, and the Students’ Union Advice Service.</p>
      <p>‘The University has a range of flexible study options for students experiencing exceptional circumstances. These options can range from the implementation of adjustments for the student, through to temporary withdrawal of studies.’</p>
