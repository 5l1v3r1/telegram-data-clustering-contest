      <p>Amnesty International has published a report, bashing Google and Facebook for <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201911211077367795-facebook-google-pose-threat-with-their-surveillance-based-business-model--amnesty-intl/">creating a "surveillance-based business model"</a>Â that is fueling human rights violations.</p>
      <p>According to the non-profit organisation, the services Facebook and Google provide come at a great cost, as they actively stockpile users' private data for advertisements, undermine privacy, and establish "near-total dominance over the primary channels through which people connect and engage with the online world".</p>
