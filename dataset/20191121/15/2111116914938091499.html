      <h3>Anthem finally costs what it's worth in this amazing Amazon deal</h3>
      <p>But it could get better</p>

      <p>BioWare's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/anthem-update-news-dlc-tips-patch-notes-and-more">Anthem</a> has had a rocky few months since its release in February this year, leading to poor sales and disappointed players. </p>
      <p>With arguments that its endgame content is weak, its loot system broken and its story not up to scratch when compared with previous narrative-driven BioWare RPGs, the developer has been fighting to win back the hearts of those who were initially in awe of Anthem's promise.</p>
      <p>Until now, nothing has really stuck. But it looks like there's a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/anthem-is-reportedly-getting-a-major-overhaul">major overhaul</a> on the way which could convert Anthem from a zero to a hero - and turning Amazon's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> offer on the title from a bargain bin dive to a great gaming investment. </p>

      <h4>Why it's an investment</h4>

      <p>Now, we hear what you're saying. Why on earth would you want to buy a game which is explicitly bad? Even if it's on offer. </p>
      <p>Well, for a start, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon</a> is offering Anthem's Legion of Dawn edition for just £11.99 This edition includes the base game alongside the Legion of Dawn ranger, colossus, storm, and interceptor armor packs, a legendary weapon, and the ranger javelin exosuit legendary gear attachment. Pretty decent for just over a tenner.</p>
      <p>Check the deal out below:</p>

      <p>But that's not why we're recommending it. Anthem seems to be following the same treacherous path that Hello Games' action-adventure No Man's Sky did. On release, No Man's Sky was a flop and prices plummeted. However, several years down the line, the game got an overhaul that essentially brought it back from the dead - with players clamoring to pick it up once more. Of course, by that point, the prices increased again.</p>
      <p>Those who <i>already </i>had No Man's Sky didn't have to worry about that issue. And that's the key.</p>
      <p>Anthem may not be a good game <i>right now</i> but an overhaul could (fingers crossed) make it the great game BioWare promised it would be. It's more of an investment than anything right now. Plus, to grab a AAA title with some extras thrown in for just over £10 isn't to be scoffed at. </p>
      <p>You have until January 8, 2020 to grab this offer.</p>
