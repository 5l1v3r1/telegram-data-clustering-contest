      <p><b>Best answer:</b> In Pokémon Sword and Shield, a Pokémon who Gigantamaxes grows to a humungous size during battle. This transformation changes the look of the Pokémon, increases the stats, and allows them to use a special G-Max Move. However, only some Pokémon can Gigantamax.</p>

      <h4>Dynamaxing vs. Gigantamaxing: What's the difference?</h4>
      <p><b>Dynamax</b>: In specific areas of the Galar region, Pokémon can temporarily transform into a colossal version of themselves during battle. This transformation changes the Pokémon's moves and increases their stats. However, it can only be used once during the battle. It's important to note that the effects of <a href="https://www.imore.com/what-dynamax-pokemon-sword-and-shield">Dynamaxing</a> only last for three turns and then a Pokémon turns back to normal. Every Pokémon has the ability to Dynamax.</p>
      <p><b>Gigantamax</b>: As with Dynamaxing, Gigantamaxing makes your Pokémon grow larger and increases their stats. However, it also changes the appearance of your Pokémon. The thing to keep in mind is that only certain species have the ability to Giganamax, and only certain individuals within that species can Gigantamax. For example, Charizard is a Pokémon that can Giganamax, but only a special Charizard will actually be able to do it. A Pokémon that can Gigantamax also gets a powerful G-Max Move specific to its species.</p>
      <h4>Which Pokémon species can Gigantamax in Sword and Shield?</h4>
      <p>Remember that only some species of Pokémon are capable of Gigantamaxing, and even then, it's only special Pokémon within that species that can do it. Here are all the Pokémon that have the potential to Gigantamax.</p>

      <p>Appletun reverts somewhat back to its first evolution and looks a bit like a worm popping out of a red apple. The difference between this Gigantamax Pokémon and Gigantamax Flapple is that the second Pokémon's apple is green instead of red. This Pokémon evolution is exclusive to Shield.</p>

      <p>Coalossal's Gigantamax form is a very threatening molten monster and also kind of looks like one of the Titans from Disney's 1997 Hercules. At any rate, you don't want to get on this guy's bad side.</p>

      <p>Much like Appletun, this Pokémon takes on the look of a worm popping out of an apple. Only this time, the apple is green. This Pokémon evolution is exclusive to Sword.</p>

      <p>Garbodor's pile of filth grows to an unpleasant level taking in everything from stuffed animals to wind-up cruise ship toys. It's really rather impressive in its Gigantamax form.</p>

      <p>A Gigantamax Gengar melds with the floor and has a gaping mouth. It really is a terrifying sight to see. His little arms stick up from the floor on either side of him.</p>

      <p>This enormous creature is a thing of nightmares. Grimmsnarl's body becomes elongated and his fingers grow into super long claws. I definitely wouldn't want to come across this Pokémon in real life.</p>

      <p>Hatterne's Gigantamax form takes on the appearance of a classy lady from the 1800s enjoying a sunny day. I love her pointed hat and the way her dress-like body shoots out when it hits the ground.</p>

      <p>When in this large state, Kingler's body gets covered in a white seafoam armor giving him the appearance of Santa Claws-er Claus. His large claw is even larger and is sure to be a fearsome spectacle in the arena.</p>

      <p>When in the Gigantamax state, Lapras's shell changes appearance and looks more like a luxury cruise ship. It's definitely a more elegant version of this Water-type.</p>

      <p>I imagen Gigantamax Snorlax comes from a Rip Van Winkle scenario: He fell asleep so long, he didn't realize that vegetation and life had begun taken residence on his person. I love the tree sticking out from the center.</p>

      <p>This is my favorite looking gigantamax Pokémon. Is it just me, or does this look kind of what Sableye would look like if it evolved? Either way, I love that Gigantamax Toxtricity pulls out an electric guitar while in battle.</p>
      <p><b>G-Max Move:</b> G-Max Stun Shock (Electric) - this either paralyzes or poisons your opponents</p>
      <h4>How do you get Gigantamax Pokémon?</h4>
      <p>Gigantamax Pikachu and Eevee can be acquired in the train station by talking to the boy and girl in the left corner. However, they'll only give these Pokémon to you if your Switch has save data for Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee! on it.</p>
      <p>Gigantamax Meowth is an Event Pokémon that can only be obtained by receiving your "Mysterious gift" from Pokémon Sword and Shield's main menu. You should note that he's only available this way until January 15, 2020.</p>
      <p>The rest of these Pokémon will need to be found in the Wild Area's dens. You'll need to complete challenging Max Raid Battles in order to have the chance of catching them. However, it's possible that the Pokémon will break out of the ball and run away. Try to use your strongest balls when catching them and good luck on your hunt!</p>
      <h4>Pokémon Titans</h4>
      <p>Since Gigantamaxing is only possible for certain Pokémon, it's a lot more exciting when you find a Pokémon that can actually do it. If nothing else, it's sure to give you an edge in battle. I love the look of many of these Gigantamax forms and am currently on the hunt to obtain them all. Good luck in your own game! Maybe I'll see your character in a Max Raid Battle!</p>
