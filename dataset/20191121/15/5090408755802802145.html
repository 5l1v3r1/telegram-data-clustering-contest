          <b>A PDF can be a great file format because the content of the document is locked, making it ideally suited for documents that will be shared, such as resumes, reports, or presentations.</b>

      <p>PDFs are the best way to share documents that you want to ensure reach their intended audience, without accidental corruption or intended alteration. This is why PDFs are so popular for resumes, professional reports, pamphlets, and so many other files that feature text, graphics, or a blend of the two.</p>
      <p>A PDF can be opened on a <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_112119_delete-pages-from-pdf-mac&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-pro-13-display-with-touch-bar-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-latest-model-space-gray%2F5998700.p%3FskuId%3D5998700">Mac</a> or a <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_112119_delete-pages-from-pdf-mac&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-x-13-touch-screen-microsoft-sq1-8gb-memory-128gb-solid-state-drive-wifi-4g-lte-matte-black%2F6375623.p%3FskuId%3D6375623">PC</a> and will look just the same, another major benefit. But while the text and graphics remain the same as when a PDF was created, PDFs are not entirely static documents. There are myriad features you can use to enhance them, like added text boxes, signatures, and doodles, and you can also always delete pages or add new ones.</p>

      <p><b>1.</b> Open the PDF document on your Mac computer using Preview.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Click on the page to be deleted in the left-hand sidebar, then click on the “Edit” tab in the top menu bar, and then click “Delete.” If you initially don’t see the sidebar in Preview, click the window icon in the upper-right corner of the screen below the red, yellow, and green buttons, and click “Thumbnails.”</p>

      <p>If you want to add pages to your PDF, there are two ways to do it.</p>
      <h3>How to add pages to a PDF on a Mac</h3>
      <p><b>1.</b> To add a blank page to your PDF, open it in Preview.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Then, click “Edit” in the top toolbar.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> Then, hover over “Insert” and select “Blank Page.” This will add a blank page that you can later add various media to as wanted.</p>

        <figcaption>The inserted pages will go after the page selected on the left-hand column.<cite>Steven John/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>4.</b> To add a page or pages from another PDF, click “Edit” and then hover over “Insert” and select “Page from File…”</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Click “Page from File…”<cite>Steven John/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>5.</b> Now find the PDF you want to add a page from in the Finder window that pops up and click the blue “Open” button. However, note that this will add all pages of that PDF to your document, so it might be time to put your new PDF page deleting skills to work.</p>
