      <p>A man wanted for questioning following the “suspicious” death of his Connecticut bar owner girlfriend was on the run Thursday — and may have fled to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/dominican-republic">Dominican Republic</a>.</p>
      <p>Alfredo Esmerli Peguero-Gomez, whose car was found at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, is being sought in the death of Janet Avalo-Alvarez, with whom he co-owned a bar with in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/connecticut">Waterbury</a>, Conn.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old's body was found earlier this week in nearby Wolcott. She was last seen at that establishment on Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>"The family is going through a lot of pain and they don’t deserve [the] pain they are going through," Grisella Guerrero, who identified herself as a family friend, said in an interview with <a href="https://www.wfsb.com/news/police-believe-suspect-in-waterbury-woman-s-murder-is-no/article_744abe5a-0c4e-11ea-920a-23e23d7d856f.html">WFSB</a>.</p>

      <p>Police have called the death “suspicious” and told WFSB they believe Avalo-Alvarez died from neck compression. She was found strangled to death a few feet from the road, <a href="https://fox61.com/2019/11/20/missing-waterbury-woman-found-dead-boyfriend-suspect-in-her-homicide/">Fox 61</a> reported.</p>
      <p>U.S. marshals are now helping in the search for Peguero-Gomez.</p>
      <p>The day after Avalo-Alvarez vanished, police went to the home the couple shared in Waterbury and Peguero-Gomez said he didn’t know where she had gone.</p>
      <p>Investigators say he left the home at 1 a.m. the following morning.</p>

      <p>Waterbury Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo says Peguero-Gomez has family in the Dominican Republic, but it’s unclear if he flew there.</p>
