      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:39:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>The Tories have raked in £5 million more in big ticket donors than any other political party in the first week of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> .</p>
      <p>The party pocketed more big cash gifts than all the other main parties combined - and 26 times more than <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> - according to new figures published by the Electoral Commission.</p>
      <p>In the same period, Labour took in just £218,500 - though Jeremy Corbyn's party traditionally raises more money through small donations, which are not declared in the same way.</p>
      <p>The watchdog publishes details of any donations made to parties over £7,500 for each week of the campaign.</p>
      <p>In total, £6,507,146 in donations was reported to the Commission between November 6 and 12 - less than the  £7,054,844 for the same period in 2017.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party took a single donation of £250,000 from businessman Jeremy Hosking - a former Tory donor who has been a major backer of Nigel Farage's operation.</p>
      <p>Tory donors include Russian banker Lubov Chernukhin.</p>
      <p>Mrs Chernukhin's husband Vladimir Chernikhin, was formerly an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, although he says he has fallen out with the leader.</p>
      <p>She has frequently made headlines as a big-ticket donor to the Tories - regularly bidding in auctions for access to senior ministers at Tory fundraisers.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year she paid £135,000 for a "girls' night out" with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> and other senior cabinet ministers.</p>
      <p>In 2018 the Tories accepted her bid of £30,000 in return for a private dinner with defence secretary Gavin Williamson in the Churchill War Rooms.</p>

      <p>And she paid £160,000 at a previous event to play tennis with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> .</p>
      <p>The biggest backer of the Conservatives was theatre producer John Gore who gave £1 million.</p>
      <p>He was also the party's biggest donor last year.</p>
      <p>The next three largest donors were the travel company Trailfinders, Countrywide Developers and WA Capital, who each gave £500,000 pounds to the party.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems accepted £275,000 in large donations during the first week of the campaign.</p>
      <p>And the Green Party accepted £30,000.</p>
