      <p>Nottingham Forest ace <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/joe-worrall">Joe Worrall</a> has spoken about the importance of the club’s future being at the City Ground.</p>
      <p>Rather than build a new stadium elsewhere - which had been explored in the past - the Reds have opted to redevelop their home on the banks of the Trent, setting in motion <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-stadium-3541842">a multi-million pound project</a> to transform it into a world-class venue.</p>
      <p>The plans were unveiled earlier this year and a planning application is now expected to be submitted before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>And boyhood Forest fan Worrall says it is a “massive thing” to be remaining at a ground with so much history attached - as he looks to be part of a team with a legacy of its own.</p>
      <p>“You can’t move away from that history,” said the Nigel Doughty Academy product. “It will be written on the walls of this football club until the day it’s finished.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, with this new stand, the team at the moment and the way we’re performing, touch wood, we can write our own names on a little bit of history on the modern day of Forest.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that I desperately want to be a part of - I strive every day, and I have done ever since I was a kid, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-worrall-3557979">to play for Forest.”</a></p>
      <p>Phase one of the redevelopment project will see the Peter Taylor Stand rebuilt with an increased capacity and improved facilities, while the Bridgford Stand is also set to be extended.</p>
      <p>And Worrall has praised the investment from owner <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/evangelos-marinakis">Evangelos Marinakis</a>, as well as the hard work from others behind the scenes.</p>

      <p>“When we have the backing of the owners and people who are the level above the players, it’s fantastic,” said the 22-year-old.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of hard work goes into this. It’s not a case of going on to the computer and doing a 3D model. It’s a long time in the planning.</p>
      <p>“It might only have been nine months or so since it was announced to the general public, but it had been a long time in the pipeline.</p>
      <p>“A lot of respect has to go to the people upstairs and the finance people.</p>
      <p>“Staying at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">the City Ground</a> is a massive thing - the fact that we’re still at home and we’re not moving away and building a totally new ground.</p>
      <p>“You could ask me the same question (if Forest had moved away) and I could be all diplomatic and say, ‘that’s fantastic’. But you want to stay at home, you want to be at the City Ground, next to the Trent and in West Bridgford.</p>
      <p>“It’s fantastic and I’m really excited.”</p>
      <p>The Reds will hope to be playing Premier League football at the updated City Ground, with Sabri Lamouchi’s men <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-championship-promotion-prospects-3556986">aiming to mount a promotion push</a> this season.</p>
      <p>They currently sit fifth in the Championship table with 15 games gone, leaving plenty of cause for optimism at the club.</p>

      <p>“It will definitely bring new life to the place,” Worrall said of the stadium plans.</p>
      <p>“I think at the moment, it’s going really well on the pitch and off the pitch. Everything is really good, so you don’t want to change too much.</p>
      <p>“But if you get the opportunity to have a new stand…</p>
      <p>“The Peter Taylor Stand is starting to look a little bit tired, so it’s just fantastic.</p>
      <p>“The club never fails to surprise you with different things and positive things.</p>
      <p>“It’s a brilliant club to be a part of, and long may it continue. With Mr Marinakis and his backing, and all the staff, truly it’s a great place to be at the minute.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s brilliant.</p>
      <p>“Eight or nine months ago, when the plans first came out, even then they looked impressive. But the new pictures are a level up again.</p>
      <p>“The money that the owner, Mr Marinakis, is willing to put in is fantastic and it’s something that I’m really looking forward to seeing from the pitch and being involved in, in the changing rooms and the warm-up areas, things like that.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully the fans will enjoy the hospitality in the new seats.”</p>
