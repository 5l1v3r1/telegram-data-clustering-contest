      <p>Even as the country is making all-out efforts for effective implementation of electric mobility, a sure-fire answer to many existing problems, a city-based indigenous firm ‘AVERA Energy’ is showing the path.</p>
      <p>A vertically integrated manufacturer in pure electric vehicles and energy retailer startup, AVERA’s Retrosa, a high-speed electric scooter, has received a shot in the arm with the State Bank of India (SBI) coming forward to sanction loans to prospective buyers.</p>

The firm not only builds these electric vehicles but also operates the entire electric vehicle supply chain, from batteries to the vehicles.</p>
