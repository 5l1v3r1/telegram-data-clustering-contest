      <p>The Infrastructure section of Louth County Council have this week submitted its Part 8 planning application, giving notice of its intention to carry out the construction of a "Park and Share Scheme at Gibstown, approximately 250m west of Junction 16 of the M1 Motorway in County Louth."</p>
      <p>The proposed works include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An off-road 'Park &amp; Share' car park facility.</li>
        <li>A right turn lane on the public road to support safe access to the facility from Junction 16 M1 Motorway.</li>
        <li>A safe pick-up and drop-off area for those using the facility.</li>
        <li>Improved public lighting provision between Junction 16 M1 Motorway and the new Park and Share facility and lighting of the facility.</li>
        <li>Measures to deter use by heavy goods vehicles. All associated site development works.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As well as the works listed above, the Council have also applied for the "provision for possible future security measures (e.g. CCTV), electric vehicle (EV) charging points and public transport connection."</p>
      <p>The application was lodged on November 19, with a decision due by January 22, 2020. Submissions are due by January 7, 2020.</p>
