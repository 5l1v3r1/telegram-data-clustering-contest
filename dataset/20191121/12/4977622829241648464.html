      <h1>MHA Cancels Indian Citizenship Of Telangana MLA Ramesh Chennamaneni For Concealing Crucial Facts; Says He’s German</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:58:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has revoked the citizenship status of Telangana MLA Ramesh Chennamaneni for concealing crucial facts and obtaining the citizenship by fraud, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/telangana-chennamaneni-ramesh-mla-citizenship-cancel-mha-german-centre-1621056-2019-11-21">reports</a> <i>India Today</i>.</p>
      <p>However the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) MLA plans to approach the courts for relief.</p>
      <p>The MHA noted in a fresh order on Wednesday (20 November), "It is not conducive to the public good that Dr Ramesh Chennamaneni continues to be a citizen of India under Section 10 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 decides that Dr Ramesh Chennamaneni ceases to be a Citizen of India."</p>
      <p>According to the government, Chennamaneni had German citizenship and did not fulfil the correct procedure to seek Indian citizenship in 2009.</p>
      <p>The complaint was filed against Chennamaneni by Congress leader A Srinivas challenging his election as a legislator.</p>
      <p>"His misrepresentation/concealment of fact misled the government of India in making its decision initially. Had he revealed the fact that he had not resided in India for one year before making the application, the competent authority in this ministry would not have granted citizenship to him," a home ministry order said.</p>
