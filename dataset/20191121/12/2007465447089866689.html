      <h1>This 2020 Audi RS Q8 SUV is basically a Lamborghini Urus</h1>
      <h2>The all-new Audi RS Q8 makes the Lambo Urus green with envy</h2>

      <p>Want a faster and meaner-looking Q8? The folks over at Audi have just made that a reality when they recently unveiled the 2020 RS Q8.</p>
      <p>Making its world debut at this year's Los Angeles Auto Show, the RS Q8 features a sportier exterior, RS-specific upgrades, a more poweful engine, as well as adaptive air suspension.</p>

      <p>At the heart of the RS Q8 is a powerful 4.0-liter bi-turbo V8. It pushes out a meaty 600 PS along with a gut-pulling 800 Nm of torque. Mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission with Quattro all-wheel drive, this beast can sprint from 0 â€“ 100 km/h in only 3.8 seconds, and reach a top speed of 305 km/h (standard top speed is at 250 km/h). Stopping power is by way of the factory-equipped RS ceramic brakes.</p>
      <p>Besides having all-wheel drive, the RS Q8 also comes with a sport rear differential which distributes torque between the rear wheels when needed. This helps improve traction, stability, as well as handling according to Audi. Meanwhile, an adapative air suspension with controlled dampers helps keep the RS Q8 riding comfortable on-road or off-road. Finally, there's all-wheel steering which allows for better agility at low speeds, and improved stability at high speeds.</p>

      <p>Drivers can also customize their driving experience via the Audi drive select system. It has seven different profiles, namely: comfort, auto, dynamic, allroad, offroad, and the customizable RS1 and RS2. Choosing any of these modes will influence the engine and transmission management, power steering, all-wheel steering, air suspension, and the engine sound.</p>
      <p>As far as looks are concerned, the RS Q8 differs from the standard offering thanks to several changes. For starters, it has an octagonal Singleframe design at the front that is paired to a RS-specfic radiator grill. The air inlets, meanwhile, are finished in gloss black which give it a meaner appearance. Topping it all off are the huge RS alloy wheels wrapped in low-profile tires, along with a roof-mounted spoiler which provides additional downforce at speed.</p>

      <p>Inside, the cabin appears to have been largely carried over from the standard Q8. However, it does come with a RS-specific steering wheel, and a unique leather trim on the seats with green contrast stitching. Like other Audis today, a 12.3-inch virtual cockpit gives drivers all the necessary information. Entertainment is provided by a MMI touchscreen system which controls the media and other in-car functions.</p>
      <p>While Lamborghini fans may point out that the RS Q8 has 50 PS and 58 Nm less than the Urus, both sit on Volkswagen's MLB Evo platform. This makes both vehicles technically the same, albeit with some noticeable exterior and interior differences.</p>

      <p>The 2020 Audi RS Q8 is expected to arrive in the US some time in 2020, with other markets to follow soon after.</p>
