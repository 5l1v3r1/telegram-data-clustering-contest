      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino reportedly confident things will go wrong for Jose Mourinho at Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese manager replaced the Argentine yesterday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:15:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is confident that his Tottenham successor Jose Mourinho will fail at the north London club, <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994589/how-mourinho-replaced-pochettino-inside-tottenhams-turbulent-day">as per a report by ESPN.</a></p>
      <p>They <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994589/how-mourinho-replaced-pochettino-inside-tottenhams-turbulent-day">report</a> that Pochettino’s decision not to resign and wait for Daniel Levy to sack him was based on a view that standing down would weaken his chances of getting another big job.</p>
      <p>So he has <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994589/how-mourinho-replaced-pochettino-inside-tottenhams-turbulent-day">apparently</a> taken the gamble of getting a sacking on his CV because he thinks that things will go wrong ‘massively’ under Mourinho.</p>
      <p>And when that happens, he feels the blame will go onto Levy, rather than Pochettino, leaving the Argentine’s reputation untarnished, as per the <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994589/how-mourinho-replaced-pochettino-inside-tottenhams-turbulent-day">report</a>.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Pochettino clearly feels the conditions aren’t right for Mourinho to succeed</h3>
      <p>More than likely, the best Tottenham can hope for is three good years, winning silverware, before Mourinho leaves the club in disarray, with no forward planning in place and likely with aging, high-earning talent for his successor to clear out.</p>
      <p>That profile of players is what Mourinho usually goes for, although he may have a huge challenge on his hands to get Levy to pay up to get them through the door without resale value.</p>
      <p>Pochettino likely feels that Levy’s demands are such that he was doing almost as well as any manager could under the circumstances.</p>
