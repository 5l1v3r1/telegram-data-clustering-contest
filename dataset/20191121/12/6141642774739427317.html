      <h1>States office strategy unveiled</h1>
      <h2>GOVERNMENT staff will be moved out of 14 offices in a move which could save up to £7 million a year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Morris</a></address>
      <p>The plan, which would see the government consolidate its current 21 offices into seven blocks, would mean 1,600 civil servants moving. No site as yet been identified.</p>
      <p>Chief Minister John Le Fondré said this could release valuable sites for affordable housing, keyworker accommodation and other development.</p>
      <p>The main government offices are currently based in Broad Street after moving out of Cyril Le Marquand House earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Senator Le Fondré said: 'There has been woeful underinvestment in the government’s office estate over many years and this government is sorting out that legacy. Too many of our staff work in a poor-quality environment in old offices, with poor wellbeing facilities, poor energy efficiency and limited disability access. In short, they are no longer fit for purpose.</p>
      <p>'Consolidating our office estate will release sites for much-needed affordable housing and other development and could save up to £7 million a year of taxpayers’ money, while providing a modern working environment for our staff.</p>
      <p>'This is another example of how this government proposes to invest for long-term benefits, modernising, improving and delivering better value for money.'</p>
      <p>The States will vacate the following:</p>
      <p>• Cyril Le Marquand House</p>
      <p>• South Hill</p>
      <p>• Philip Le Feuvre House</p>
      <p>• Huguenot House</p>
      <p>• Maritime House</p>
      <p>• Jubilee Wharf</p>
      <p>• Maison Le Pape</p>
      <p>• Le Bas</p>
      <p>• Highlands administrative offices (not Highlands College).</p>
      <p>And in the next four or five years will end the lease of:</p>
      <p>• Broad Street</p>
      <p>• The Parade</p>
      <p>• Durell House</p>
      <p>• Eagle House</p>
      <p>• Liberté House</p>
      <p>• Bermuda House.</p>
