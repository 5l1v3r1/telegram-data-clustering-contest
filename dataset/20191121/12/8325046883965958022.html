      <p>Prince Andrew’s reputation is in tatters after a decision to give an on-camera interview about his friendship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein sparked a series of events that effectively killed his royal career.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-interview-firms-cut-ties-list-2019-11">More than a dozen businesses, charities, and universities distanced themselves</a> from the prince in the days following the interview’s airing, with many pulling their sponsorship of his pet project, <a href="https://www.insider.com/what-party-at-buckingham-palace-is-like-photos-2018-11">the entrepreneurship charity Pitch@Palace</a>.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-andrew-stepping-away-royal-2019-11">he announced he would step down from public duties</a> as the Duke of York “for the foreseeable future” in light of the interview’s fallout, which saw headlines focus on his lack of remorse for Epstein’s victims, and the bizarre rebuttals he offered to claims that he had sex with a trafficked teenager.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily/status/1197213153852977153">his statement</a> he acknowledged that the interview had gone so badly it hampered the royal family’s ability to function.</p>
      <p>“It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support,” he said.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In the “BBC Newsnight” interview, Andrew said he “let the side down” over his friendship with Epstein but <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-andrew-pizza-express-alibi-virginia-giuffre-allegation-2019-11">denied ever meeting Virginia Giuffre, the woman</a> who claims she was forced to have sex with Andrew when she was 17.</p>
      <p>He was widely criticized for a perceived lack of sympathy with Epstein’s victims, and for relying on alibis such as a meal at Pizza Express and his medical inability to sweat in an attempt to refute Giuffre’s claim.</p>
      <p>One of the most surprising features of Andrew’s downfall is that he brought it on himself. By volunteering to give the interview, Andrew revived a news cycle that had gone relatively quiet, bringing about the outcry that forced him from his position.</p>
      <p>His chief press adviser, Jason Stein, <a href="https://www.insider.com/report-prince-andrew-spin-doctor-quit-after-advising-against-bbc-interview-2019-11">reportedly quit his role two weeks</a> before the “BBC Newsnight” interview, fearing the potential blowback. He had urged Andrew not to do the interview, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/prince-andrews-pr-man-quit-after-advising-against-interview-gvc59hmql?ni-statuscode=acsaz-307">The Times of London reported</a>, but was overruled.</p>
      <p>The British media <a href="https://www.insider.com/newspaper-front-pages-prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-interview-2019-11">described the interview as a “car crash.”</a> A Buckingham Palace source called it “one of the single worst PR moves in recent history,” <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/prince-andrews-pr-man-quit-after-advising-against-interview-gvc59hmql">according to The Times</a>.</p>
      <p>The reputational damage from the interview has also crystalized into real consequences for Queen Elizabeth II’s second son.</p>
      <h3>Businesses cut ties as Andrew threatens their reputation</h3>
      <p>Businesses have cut ties with Andrew, who now faces mounting public calls to testify to the FBI in its investigation into Epstein, who killed himself in his New York City jail cell in August while facing sex-trafficking charges.</p>

      <p>Top-tier firms, charities, and universities around the world have ended their partnerships with Pitch@Palace, Andrew’s charity for tech startups and investors.</p>
      <p>At least four other institutions, including two universities, are also reviewing their ties with Andrew.</p>
      <p>The student union at the University of Huddersfield on Monday voted to lobby the prince to resign from his role as Chancellor, saying: “We as students at the University of Huddersfield and members of Huddersfield Students’ Union should not be represented by a man with ties to organized child sexual exploitation and assault.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Pitch@Palace will continue business as usual, Buckingham Palace has insisted, and Andrew will maintain some involvement. But it will inevitably be under a heavy cloud.</p>
      <p>The consequences are ironic given Andrew’s apparent motivation to use the interview as a way of pivoting his public profile away from Epstein and back toward entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>After filming the interview, Andrew told the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that “next time you come [to Buckingham Palace], we will talk about Pitch@Palace,” <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/emily-maitlis-my-interview-with-prince-andrew-8hhclpwcf">according to Maitlis’ account of the day in The Times</a>.</p>

      <p>Andrew suffered further reputational blows earlier this week, seemingly prompted by the public-relations disaster of the interview.</p>
      <p>Rohan Silva, a former UK government official of Sri Lankan descent, accused Andrew of using a racist slur in a meeting and telling him to stop “playing the white man.”</p>
      <p>Silva, at the time an aide to Prime Minister David Cameron, <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/prince-andrew-rohan-silva-language-a4289571.html">wrote in the Evening Standard</a> that Andrew told him “with a smile” while discussing international trade: “If you’ll pardon the expression, that really is the n—– in the woodpile.”</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace said Silva’s account was untrue, but the exchange puts Andrew further on the defensive.</p>
      <p>Jacqui Smith, the UK home secretary from 2007 to 2009, also told LBC on Tuesday that during a state banquet for Saudi Arabia’s royal family, Andrew had made a joke that included “a comment about camels” that left everyone there “slack-jawed.” <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7701201/Prince-Andrew-unbelievable-racist-comments-Arabs-claims-ex-Home-Secretary-Jacqui-Smith.html">MailOnline reported</a> on the account.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace responded to Smith’s account saying that Andrew “has many friends from” the Middle East and “does not tolerate racism in any form,” MailOnline reported.</p>
      <h3>Andrew agrees to cooperate with law enforcement</h3>
      <p>In the days following the interview, lawyers representing Epstein accusers as well as influential royal commentators have <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-andrew-bbc-newsnight-fbi-virginia-guiffre-2019-11">called on Andrew to submit to an interview with the FBI after his media appearance</a>, Insider’s Mikhaila Friel reported.</p>
      <p>They included lawyers for Giuffre and Gloria Allred, who is representing five other Epstein accusers.</p>
      <p>Later Monday, another unnamed Epstein accuser who says Epstein sexually abused her when she was 15, gave a press conference also calling on Andrew to give a statement under oath, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50469409">the BBC reported</a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In his Wednesday statement, Andrew suggested that he would cooperate with law-enforcement officials investigating Epstein.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required,” he said. The Office of the Duke of York declined to provide further detail on the statement, <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-andrew-stepping-away-royal-2019-11">Insider’s Darcy Schild reported</a>.</p>
      <p>It is a humiliating conclusion to a move that Andrew must have hoped would see him seize back the initiative after a slow drip of damaging commentary about his ties to Epstein.</p>
      <p>Instead, by his own free will, the interview intensified the drip to a flood, and swept away his reputation with it.</p>
