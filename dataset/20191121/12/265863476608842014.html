      <p>Tiny Harris hosted Fox Soul, and she told her fans that she had a great time doing it. Check out the post that she shared on her social media account.</p>
      <p>‘I had an amazing time hosting #FoxSoul Getting Real With Tiny.. Exec. Produced by my good friend @duboseofficial &amp; I had some amazing comedians to join me.. Keyshia E &amp; Heather J,Precious Hall, Melanie Camarcho download Fox Soul &amp; go to www.foxsoul.tv 👑🙌🏽🤣’ Tiny captioned her post.</p>
      <p>Someone gushed over the black hair that Tip’s wife was sporting: ‘Dark hair is a good look on you @majorgirl &amp; Congratulations!’</p>

      <p>Another follower also praised her look and said: ‘I don’t care @majorgirl I know my opinion means absolutely nothing to you but black hair on you is everything I think you look so cute it gives you such a youthful vibrant look 🤷🏽‍♀️ so pretty ❤️’</p>
      <p>As expected, someone brought up the dreadful subject of Dyjah Harris’ virginity. You may recall that T.I. said not too long ago during a show that he makes sure to accompany Deyjah to the gynecologist, just to make sure that she is still pregnant.</p>
      <p>The person believes that Tip did the right thing and said: ‘Come on people if a woman said she was checking her daughter you guys be high fiving her ,it a dad who’s making sure his daughter doesn’t ruin her life I salute you Tip, if a lot of these fathers would care they teenager wouldn’t be sitting at home rocking a baby get out of that chair and get back to what you do best making changes in life and fighting for the people you are a great father, job well done.’</p>
      <p>Another commenter responded: ‘yeah but he told the world..so now everyone knows and now his daughter is embarrassed.’</p>
      <p>Since the whole scandal exploded, Tip has not been posting anything on social media and his <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/tiny-harris-fans-are-worried-that-tip-stopped-posting-on-social-media-since-the-deyjah-harris-related-scandal-342720/">fans are worried</a>.</p>
