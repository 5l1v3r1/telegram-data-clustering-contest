      <h1>3,000 empty homes to lose 50% council tax discount in Carmarthenshire</h1>
      <h2>Owners will have to pay the full council tax rate from April next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:47:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Youle</a></address>
      <p>People with properties which have been empty for more than six months are to lose their 50% council tax discount in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/carmarthenshire">Carmarthenshire</a> .</p>
      <p>Council chiefs made the decision, which will affect around 3,000 homes and come into force next April, at an executive board meeting this week.</p>
      <p>But they didn't opt to add a council tax premium to these properties, as some other local authorities have done.</p>
      <p>And current exemptions and discounts - such as when the owner is in residential care - will continue where appropriate.</p>
      <p>Cllr Linda Evans, executive board member for housing, said: "We have quite a few empty houses in our county and we are working hard to get these homes back into use."</p>
      <p>She said letters were sent to empty homeowners a while back encouraging them to get in touch - a move which has resulted in around 190 properties being brought back into use over the past year.</p>
      <p>"But there are more out there," said Cllr Evans. "I am encouraging house owners to come and have a chat with us, and contact the housing department.</p>
      <p>"There is help available - there are incentives and loans, which are no-interest loans."</p>
      <p>The report before board members said empty properties could negatively affect the vicinity in terms of market value and quality of life, and encourage vandalism and squatting.</p>
      <p>Empty properties are classed as unoccupied and substantially unfurnished.</p>
      <p>Authorities in Wales have been able to reduce or remove the 50% council tax discount since 2003, but until now they have been compensated by the Welsh Government if they chose not to.</p>
      <p>That is set to change next year, meaning that councils will lose out financially if they continue with the discount.</p>
      <p>For Carmarthenshire Council, the loss would be around Â£1 million per year.</p>
      <p>The executive board's decision will increase the county's council tax base, in turn benefiting town councils and Dyfed-Powys Police.</p>
      <p>Cllr David Jenkins, executive board member for finances, suggested the authority should write again to the owners of the 3,000-odd affected properties.</p>
      <p>Jake Morgan, director of community services, said: "Some sort of proactive initiative is a really good idea."</p>
