      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/inter-milan/"><b>Inter Milan</b></a> will be looking to continue their pursuit of Serie A leaders Juventus when they travel to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/torino/"><b>Torino</b></a> in Italy's top flight on Saturday night.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonio-conte/"><b>Antonio Conte</b></a>'s side sit second in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/serie-a/table.html">Serie A</a> with 31 points from their 12 matches this season, while Torino are currently down in 11th with 14 points to show from their start to the 2019-20 campaign.</p>

      <p>Four wins, two draws and six defeats - that is how Torino have performed in Serie A this season. A total of 14 points has left them in 11th spot in the table, some 17 points off their opponents on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Turin giants finished seventh in Italy's top flight last term, while they have actually only ended a Serie A season in the bottom half of the table in just one of their last six campaigns.</p>
      <p>It would not be a surprise to see <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/walter-mazzarri/"><b>Walter Mazzarri</b></a>'s side in and around the top 10 come May, although their form in recent weeks has been slightly disappointing. Indeed, between September 30 and November 2, Torino failed to win a single match, losing four of their six league fixtures to slide down the table.</p>
      <p>The Bull returned to winning ways in style before the international break, though, as they put four goals past Brescia. It has been a tough run of matches when considering that two of their last three have been against Lazio and Juve, while they must now face the second-best side in the league according to the table.</p>
      <p>Torino would actually be doing their bitter rivals Juve a huge favour by overcoming Inter but that will not be in their minds on Saturday night as they look to move up the division.</p>

      <p>Inter are currently second in Italy's top flight, just one point behind leaders Juve having made a fine start to the campaign. Indeed, Conte's team have won 10, drawn one and lost one of their 12 matches to keep pace with the reigning champions heading into the latter stages of November.</p>
      <p>The gap from first to second could be four points by the time that this fixture rolls around, although Juve's clash on Saturday afternoon is against Atalanta BC, and it would certainly not be a shock if the champions were to drop points, opening the door for Inter to potentially move to the summit.</p>
      <p>Inter have not been without their problems this season, and Conte was highly critical of his team following the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/borussia-dortmund-vs-inter-milan_game_96708.html">3-2 loss</a> at Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on November 5. The Milan giants returned to winning ways at home to Hellas Verona on November 9, though, and will be looking for another victory here.</p>
      <p>The Black and Blues will have more than one eye on next week's European tie with Slavia Prague, however, which is a very important fixture as they look to stay in touch with the top two - Dortmund and Barcelona - in the section.</p>
      <p>Inter have incredibly not won Serie A since lifting their 18th title in 2010, and it would be some story if Conte could inspire the club to the championship this season, particularly when considering Juve's utter dominance in recent years.</p>

      <p>Torino have a number of injury concerns ahead of the match with both <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lyanco/"><b>Lyanco</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-laxalt/"><b>Diego Laxalt</b></a> picking up problems on international duty, meaning that the pair are doubts for this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kevin-bonifazi/"><b>Kevin Bonifazi</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/iago-falque/"><b>Iago Falque</b></a> are also still on the sidelines, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/simone-zaza/"><b>Simone Zaza</b></a> is unlikely to recover from a sprained ankle in time for Saturday night's affair in Turin.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andrea-belotti/"><b>Andrea Belotti</b></a> scored twice in the 4-0 win over Brescia before the international break, and the Italian is once again expected to be supported by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/simone-verdi/"><b>Simone Verdi</b></a> in the final third.</p>
      <p>As for Inter, on-loan Manchester United attacker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alexis-sanchez/"><b>Alexis Sanchez</b></a> remains on the sidelines with an ankle injury, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matteo-politano/"><b>Matteo Politano</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alessandro-bastoni/"><b>Alessandro Bastoni</b></a> are still unavailable for selection.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/romelu-lukaku/"><b>Romelu Lukaku</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lautaro-martinez/"><b>Lautaro Martinez</b></a> will continue as the front two in a 3-5-2 formation, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stefano-sensi/"><b>Stefano Sensi</b></a> should feature in the XI having recovered from his recent injury problems.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-godin/"><b>Diego Godin</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonio-candreva/"><b>Antonio Candreva</b></a> should return to the side having been omitted from the first XI against Verona last time out.</p>
      <p><b>Torino possible starting lineup:</b> Sirigu; Izzo, N'Koulou, Bremer; Ansaldi, Lukic, Rincon, Meite, Aina; Verdi; Belotti</p>
      <p><b>Inter Milan possible starting lineup:</b> Handanovic; Skriniar, Godin, De Vrij; Biraghi, Barella, Brozovic, Sensi, Candreva; Martinez, Lukaku</p>

      <h3>We say: Torino 1-2 Inter Milan</h3>
      <p>Inter might well have the chance to move to the top of the table this weekend when considering that Juve have a very, very tough game at Atalanta. Torino were excellent against Brescia last time out but we fancy Conte's side to pick up an important three points in Turin.</p>
