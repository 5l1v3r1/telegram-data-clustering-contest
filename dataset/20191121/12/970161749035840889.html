        <b>Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) has found himself at a crossroads as his recent spate of crimes has left him facing losing everything which truly matters – his daughter, his family and the man he loves, Callum Highway (Tony Clay).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The troubled EastEnders lad has been caught up in a number of dangerous and spiteful criminal activities to ry and exert himself as a man to be taken seriously and his father’s son. But after a wake up call from Kathy Beale (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gillian-taylforth/">Gillian Taylforth</a>) and an offer from Callum to help him turn over a new leaf, he is questioning his future.</p>
      <p>Callum is hopeful that he has got through to Ben and it certainly seems like he is reconsidering his actions as he feels awful when he sees how much pressure and stress Martin Fowler (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bye/">James Bye</a>) is under after being tasked with an illegal job.</p>
      <p>When he then sees Martin with Arthur and sees a happy, smiling family man, Ben realises that he can’t keep doing this to Martin. He is also feeling pangs of responsibility over the hardships of Karen Taylor (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lorraine-stanley/">Lorraine Stanley</a>), who took a loan from Ben’s associate Tubbs.</p>

      <p>Seeing her struggling and taking on extra work, Ben tries to convince Tubbs to let her off but Tubbs is defiant and worries that Ben is going soft. Later, Callum clocks Ben exchanging money with Tubbs and worries that everything he has said to him has been ignored.</p>

      <p>But is everything as it seems? Is Ben organising another crime or is he settling a score to right some of his wrongs? And if the latter, will Callum see it that way?</p>

      <p>Ben seems to be taking his pledge to go legit seriously, particularly with Callum’s ambition to join the police force. But can he stick to his goal?</p>
