      <p>The lyrics for beloved Christmas song “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” very clearly affirm that “scary ghost stories” are just as much a part of the holiday season as “mistletoeing.” And if FX’s spin on <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/06/kevin-hart-and-paramount-are-developing-a-remake-of-scrooged-which-we-can-all-agree-is-very-necessary">the oft-adapted Dickens classic</a> wants to lean into its horror elements, we are all for it.</p>
      <p>Guy Pearce stars as Scrooge (other cast members include <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/06/andy-serkis-thinks-performance-capture-will-just-be-how-all-actors-work-in-100-years">Andy Serkis</a> and <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/06/the-greatest-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-moments-so-far"><i>What We Do in the Shadows</i></a>’ Kayvan Novak) in what is most definitely a dark, dark take on <i>A Christmas Carol</i><i>,</i> with Ridley Scott and Tom Hardy among its producers. Steven Knight<i> (Locke, Serenity)</i> directs. Check out this grim-as-hell trailer:</p>

      <p>“This is the place where Christmas comes to die,” indeed. <i>A Christmas Carol</i> premieres December 19 on America's FX network. It does not currently have an Australian premiere date.</p>
