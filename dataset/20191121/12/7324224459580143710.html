      <p>The Steelhouse Lane Lock-up, in Birmingham, which operated from 1891 to 2016, will open its doors to the public on January 3.</p>
      <p>The prison once housed the real members of the Peaky Blinders - gangsters who operated in the city a century ago. They have been made famous by the hit-series on the BBC, Peaky Blinders.</p>
      <p>Guests will be able to walk freely around the building, look inside cells and find out more about the Victorian-era and Peaky Blinders prisoners who stayed there.</p>
      <p>Old police uniforms will be on display while the site's shop will have police gifts on sale.</p>
      <p>There will be four 90 minute slots that people can book onto.</p>
      <p>An advert for the event said: "The Steelhouse Lane Lock-up was in use from 1891 to 2016 and many of the original Victorian features are still present, alongside more modern custody facilities. The Grade-II listed building shows how a mini prison operated in a busy city centre for well over a century."</p>
