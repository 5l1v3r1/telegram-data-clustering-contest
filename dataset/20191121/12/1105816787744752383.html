      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan felicitated on Thursday his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa on his appointment as prime minister of the democratic socialist republic.</p>
      <p>The prime minister lauded the progress made by Sri Lanka during Rajapaksa’s two terms as president, said a statement by Pakistan’s Foreign Office.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, newly-elected Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa named his brother, Mahinda, as prime minister, cementing the grip on power of a clan credited with crushing the Tamil Tigers 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>PM Imran expressed the desire to work closely with the Sri Lankan counterpart to “further strengthen Pakistan-Sri Lanka bilateral relations in all dimensions”.</p>
