      <h1>Satya Nadella takes “Businessperson of the Year” title on Fortune’s 2019 list</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Atiya</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft was recently voted the “most <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-ethical/">ethical</a> publicly traded company in USA” for the second year in a row; and now, Satya Nadella has been recognised as <a href="https://fortune.com/businessperson-of-the-year/">Fortune’s</a> Businessperson of the Year for 2019.</p>
      <p>Up against 20 different business leaders, the computer scientist turned Microsoft CEO took the top spot on the list, which is based on leaders who “tackled audacious goals, overcame impossible odds and found creative solutions”.</p>
      <blockquote>“In a year dominated by political chaos and bluster, it was a rare brand of steady — even quiet — leadership that won the day in the business world.  And no one epitomizes that brand of obsessively results-driven, team-based leadership more than our new No. 1 Businessperson of the Year.”- Fortune</blockquote>
      <p>The American multinational business magazine further praised Nadella for his ability to quickly adapt to and thrive in uncharted territory:</p>
      <blockquote>He’d never worked in finance, another training ground for CEOs. And his stature on the global stage was non-existent. What’s more, having joined Microsoft in 1992, he was thoroughly steeped in a dog-eat-dog Microsoft culture that had contributed to the company’s stagnation.”</blockquote>
      <p>Satya Nadella attributes his success to his diligent workforce, saying “CEOs can only do what they do if they have an amazing team”, and that he’s “blessed to have that.”</p>
