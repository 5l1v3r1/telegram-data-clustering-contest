        <b>KISS performed a rare show specifically for great white sharks in Australia this week, but their underwater fans didn’t turn up for the occasion.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gene Simmons, Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer headed to the coast of Port Lincoln in South Australia on Monday, to host a special gig for just eight fans and some members of the press on their The End of the Road Tour.</p>
      <p>The point of the show, hosted by Adventure Bay Charters, was to show how the company attracts sharks using sound waves rather than bait like blood.</p>
      <p>However, it seems the great whites either didn’t get the memo or got the date on their invitation wrong as they were a complete no-show.</p>
      <p>Adventure Bay Charters owner Matt Waller praised KISS’ performance so it’s unlikely their rock hits scared the sharks off – or maybe they did.</p>

      <p>‘The guys were tight, they were right into it, it was loud, there were lights, there were smoke machines — it was everything that a KISS concert should be,’ Waller <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-18/kiss-plays-one-off-concert-for-great-white-sharks/11714340">told ABC Eyre Peninsula.</a></p>
      <p>Songs featured in KISS’ set, which was <a href="https://7news.com.au/entertainment/music/inside-kiss-only-australian-show-played-on-a-boat-off-the-coast-of-port-lincoln-c-563998">filmed by 7 News</a>, included I Love It Loud, Deuce, Black Diamond and Rock and Roll All Nite.</p>

      <p>It’s said that sharks are attracted to the ‘low-frequency sounds of rock n roll’, so speakers were broadcast underwater in an attempt to entice them towards the performance.</p>
      <p>Perhaps thrashing around in the water is their way of rocking out? Sharks have been totally misunderstood this whole time – they’re not hungry, just rockers.</p>
      <p>KISS member Paul Stanley was forced to miss out on the performance after being diagnosed with the flu recently. But he previously admitted he found the concept of the shark performance interesting, and said: ‘I’m not sure how much of us the sharks can take. I’m hoping they know Rock And Roll All Nite.’</p>

      <p>It was the only Australian date on KISS’ tour as they cancelled the other seven shows Down Under due to Paul’s sickness.</p>
      <p>KISS are expected to resume their farewell tour on 8 December in Sendai, Japan. It’s not known if Paul will rejoin the group.</p>

      <p>The tour will run until 17 July 2021 at a currently undisclosed location in New York City.</p>
      <p>We’re guessing there will be no sharks that night either.</p>
