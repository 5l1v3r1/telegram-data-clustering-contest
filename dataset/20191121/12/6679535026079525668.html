      <p>The Government machinery is lax in efficiently implementing the Supreme Court order, said the officials of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (MOSC) at a press meet here on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Metropolitan Yuhanon Mar Dioscoros, the Episcopal Synod secretary, said the lethargic attitude of the Kerala State government is delaying the implementation of court order for the last two years. The enthusiasm government has shown to implement other court orders was not seen when it came to the Church dispute.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan alleged that police and government were supporting the trend of handling disputes with violence.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court has endorsed the stand of the Orthodox Church that it was not a dispute related to faith but administrative. Yet, it is propagated as a faith-related dispute, said Mar Dioscoros.</p>
      <p>The false propaganda that Orthodox Church is encroaching on other churches under the guise of Supreme Court’s verdict is baseless, he said.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan clarified that all that Orthodox Church has initiated steps to only reinstate administration according to the bylaw of 1934.</p>
      <p>A press release stated: “'Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church is of the stand that churches should be administered as per the system followed between 1958 to 1972. The Court has also clarified that the churches should be administered as per the bylaw of 1934.”'</p>
      <p>The reason for the present issues is reluctance on the part of Patriarch faction to be under a systematic administration. They are against presenting account statements at the parish level and diocese level.</p>
      <p>“We are for the unification of the churches as there have never been two factions of the Malankara Church. The nomenclature of Orthodox and Jacobite are the same. It is only to denote factionalism that the nomenclature got separated”, said Mar Dioscoros.</p>
      <p>“He said the dispute is only in the foreign administration of the churches and not in the faith”</p>
      <p>In churches where Court order was executed such administrative councils have been elected, the Metropolitan pointed out. Orthodox Church stands for a litigation-free united church, he said.</p>
      <p>“The government should initiate action against those spread fake news that the funeral of a Soldier was prevented at Piravom. Though the parish priest informed there was no obstacle for the funeral, the opposite faction did not accept it and refused to take the dead body to the church. Even the Supreme Court has upheld the stand of the Orthodox Church regarding funerals. Following this, the patriarch faction had withdrawn petitions seeking verification of Article 32. Orthodox faction pointed out, the allegation that the apex court dismissed contempt plea is not factual, the ruling was to hear the argument within seven days, that does not mean it has been dismissed,” said the release.</p>
      <p>Priest Trustee Father M.O. John, MOSC Association secretary, advocate Biju Oommen and Church spokesperson Father Dr. Johns Abraham Konat were also present at the press conference.</p>
