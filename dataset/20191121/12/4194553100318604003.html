      <h1>(Video) First glimpse of Liverpool’s new training ground looks potentially stunning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have a released a video showing what’s been done so far at the new Kirkby training base, which is set to be completed at some point next year.</p>
      <p>Work is going along very nicely on the facility which will see us combine the first-team and the Academy instead of having them separate which is what happens currently with Melwood restricted to senior pros.</p>
      <p>In the video, you’ll see the ground being initially broken by Jurgen Klopp and co. and the three full-sized pitches which have been carved out already!</p>
      <p>This club really is going places and as fans, it’s wonderful to be part of the journey.</p>
