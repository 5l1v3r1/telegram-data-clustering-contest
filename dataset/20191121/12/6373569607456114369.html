      <h1>Aldi overcharged couple £40 and left them feeling humiliated</h1>
      <h2>They were made to unpack their shopping to prove the didn't have the portable gas grill Aldi had charged them for</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:56:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly Williams, Max Channon</a></address>
      <p>A couple who queried their shopping bill discovered they had been charged nearly £40 for an item they hadn't bought.</p>
      <p>And, adding insult to injury, they say they were left feeling "embarrassed and humiliated" when they were made to empty their shopping bags to prove they didn't have the portable gas grill they'd been incorrectly charged for.</p>
      <p>Daniel and Pamela Murray popped into the Aldi store at Marina Quay, in Rhyl, North Wales,  for a few items, but were stunned when their bill came to over £66, reports <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/couple-humiliated-aldi-made-unpack-17277119?_ga=2.6217843.1382761747.1574065510-1119835707.1574057290">North Wales Live.</a></p>
      <p>When they questioned it, they claim the cashier told them she had scanned everything they had and that was the total.</p>
      <p>So the pair from Rhyl, who are both in their 60s asked for a receipt to be printed and discovered they'd been charged £39.99 for a portable gas grill they hadn't even bought.</p>

      <p>The manager was called and they were made to unpack their shopping in front of a queue of customers.</p>
      <p>Speaking to North Wales Live, Daniel said: "We'd only popped in for a few things and there was only one till open at the time.</p>
      <p>"We loaded our items onto the belt but we got a shock when the cashier told us the bill was £66.</p>
      <p>"I said: 'That can't be right, we've only got two carrier bags.'</p>
      <p>"I asked her to print a receipt and it was showing £39.99 for a portable gas grill we hadn't even bought.</p>
      <p>"The manager and a security guard was called over and we had to unpack all our shopping so they could check the item wasn't there.</p>

      <p>"By this time a big queue was forming and we felt so embarrassed and humiliated. We didn't even get an apology."</p>
      <p>Daniel said the £39.99 was eventually deducted with their real bill only coming to £26.</p>
      <p>He added: "After the incident I decided to write a letter to the store to say I wasn't happy with how the matter had been handled having not been given an apology.</p>
      <p>"I also wanted to warn them that maybe something had been coded up wrong, in case this happens to someone else who might not notice being overcharged before it's too late.</p>
      <p>"How would people who've left the store prove they hadn't bought it?</p>
      <p>"Anyway, I didn't get any response to my letter, nor to a further email that was sent to the Aldi head office.</p>
      <p>"We don't want anything, we just don't think it's very good customer service."</p>
      <p>An Aldi spokesman said: "We have apologised to the family for their experience at the Rhyl store.”</p>
