      <h1>Risk on, risk off, repeat! US-China trade deal now faces Hong Kong hurdle</h1>
      <h2>Investors who had sought the safety of government bonds, the yen and gold in early trade shifted back from those positions after China reportedly invited U.S. negotiators for talks.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:24:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:24</time> by <a rel="author">Thyagaraju Adinarayan | Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Stocks slid further on Thursday as the standoff between the world's two largest economies expanded beyond trade, reducing the odds of a "phase-one" deal this year and forcing investors to shed risky assets.</p>
      <p>Investors had widely hoped for a US-China trade deal by mid-November but the absence of one, and Washington's bill to support protesters in Hong Kong, has brought progress grinding to a halt.</p>
      <p>With U.S. President Donald Trump seen as likely to sign the bill, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/deutsche-bank">Deutsche Bank </a>strategist Jim Reid said this "could risk progress towards a phase one trade deal".</p>
      <p>European shares nevertheless bounced back from day lows in late morning trade as fresh reports emerged that China has invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing.</p>
      <p>The trade-sensitive German blue-chip index was down 0.2%, recovering from a 0.7% fall, after the Wall Street Journal reported Beijing hopes the round of talks can take place before next Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.</p>
      <p>U.S. S&amp;P 500 futures were marginally down, having dropped as much as 0.6% in Asian trade. The S&amp;P 500 had hit a record high as recently as Tuesday on trade deal hopes, but Washington's move on Hong Kong derailed the rally.</p>
      <p>"The cracks in equity market sentiment widened a little further yesterday, although this setback remains modest in the context of the index gains enjoyed so far in Q4," said Ian Williams, economics &amp; strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt.</p>
      <p>Trade experts and people close to the White House said completion of a "phase one" U.S.-China trade deal could slide into next year, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks and the Trump administration counters with demands of its own.</p>
      <p>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, also the chief trade negotiator, said he was "cautiously optimistic" on a phase one deal, according to a report by Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1% to a near three-week lows, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbling 1.6% while Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.5%. Chinese mainland shares dropped 0.3%.</p>
      <p>Investors who had sought the safety of government bonds, the yen and gold in early trade shifted back from those positions after China reportedly invited U.S. negotiators for talks.</p>
      <p>"Our short-term strategy remains fairly cautious, as <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>are very narrowly driven -- every positive piece of news in trade negotiations sends <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>higher, while any disappointment sinks," said Marija Veitmane, Senior Strategist at State Street Global <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">Markets.</a></p>
      <p>"This makes it very hard for investors to build positions in risk trades."</p>
      <p>Spot gold reversed gains to trade 0.2% lower at $1,468.91 per ounce as of 1127 GMT.=&gt;</p>
      <p>German government bond yields -- which move inversely to price -- bounced back from two-week lows, while the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to 1.7551% , off three-week lows touched earlier in the day.=rr&gt;=rr&gt;</p>
      <p>The Chinese yuan meanwhile cut some losses after hitting three-week lows, and were last trading at 7.0210 to the dollar in onshore trade.=cfxs&gt;</p>
      <p>The Japanese yen , which rallied almost 1% from more than five-month lows, was flat against the greenback.=&gt;</p>
      <p>The euro gained slightly and was last trading at $1.1083 ahead of the release of minutes of the European Central Bank's most recent policy meeting. =&gt;</p>
      <p>Oil prices dipped, paring some of the 2% gains made on Wednesday after a better-than-expected U.S. crude inventories report and as Russia said it would continue its cooperation with OPEC to keep the market balanced.</p>
      <p>Global benchmark Brent futures dropped 0.4% to $62.08. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 0.4% at $56.73 per barrel in early Thursday trade.</p>
