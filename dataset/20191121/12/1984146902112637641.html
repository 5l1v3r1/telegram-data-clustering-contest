      <h2>Detectives say some of the items have been in the family for generations and the occupants are 'devastated'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:54:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Collings</a></address>
      <p>An investigation is under way after burglars raided a pensioner's home and stole a safe containing sentimental jewellery.</p>
      <p>The victim has been left devastated and police say some of the items that were stolen had been in the family for generations.</p>
      <p>The burglars struck on Monday morning at an address on Lime Street in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland.</a></p>
      <p>The raiders removed a key safe off the wall of the property before forcing their way inside and carrying out a cynical search for valuables while the occupant was out.</p>
      <p>A large personal safe, which included sentimental jewellery and private papers, was stolen from the address.</p>
      <p>Officers are now keen to hear from anybody who saw anything suspicious in the area.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Michael Boyd, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police’s</a> southern burglary team, said: “This was an appalling crime that has caused a huge amount of upset and distress to the elderly victim and their family.</p>
      <p>“A number of sentimental items that have been in the family for generations were inside the safe that was taken, and the occupants are understandably devastated at the prospect of never seeing those personal possessions again.</p>
      <p>“We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident, but would now ask anyone who lives in that area that may have seen something suspicious at any point on Monday morning to get in touch.</p>
      <p>"Your information could be the key to reuniting these items with the owner.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting reference 649 181119 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
