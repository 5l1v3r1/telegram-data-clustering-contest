        <b>Shocked workmen discovered human remains buried beneath a main street through Stirling city centre.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gas workers were in disbelief when they unearthed parts of a skeleton last week.</p>
      <p>Workers for SGN had been carrying out work to cap a redundant gas pipe in Murray Place when they made the grim discovery on Saturday, November 9. It’s understood that a human leg bone was discovered there.</p>
      <p>Further human remains were discovered there last week.</p>
      <p>Archaeologists were still on-site on Thursday afternoon continuing investigations and it is thought four skeletons have been unearthed.</p>
      <p>Gas workers had opened the road to a depth of several feet.</p>
      <p>Following the discovery police were called. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “Enquiries are continuing and it’s suspected the remains are historical.</p>

      <p>“Officers are working with the relevant partners to establish the full circumstances of the discovery.”</p>
      <p>Observer columnist and Stirling Council Archaeologist, Dr Murray Cook, was contacted by police to provide his expertise and surmised that the remains may have been part of an ancient burial ground. He said: “I went for a look on Sunday (November 10) and thought it was likely to be part of the Dominican Friary which was founded in 1233 and destroyed in the 1560s at the Reformation. This ran from Friars Street to where McDonald’s is now sited. It’s worth noting that Edward I stayed here when he took over Scotland.”</p>
      <p>SGN appointed AOC Archaeology – a firm of experts from Edinburgh – to conduct the investigation. The uncovered around four bodies.</p>
      <p>Dr Cook added: “The ones they have disturbed to date will be lifted for analysis and reburial; those that have not been disturbed will be left in situ.</p>
      <p>“The find is very exciting; we thought the friary remains had been destroyed in Murray Place but they are just a couple of feet under the road. This is an incredible survival and proves just how amazing Stirling’s past really was.”</p>
      <p>The friary belonged to the Dominican Order, known as the Blackfriars, from 1233 until the Scottish Reformation in 1559.</p>
      <p>Edward I of England had stayed at the Stirling friary to recover from injuries after being trampled by his horse following the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. He is also thought to have stayed at the friary again in 1304 when he besieged Stirling Castle.</p>
