      <p>MAYO County Council has confirmed that the Square and Market Street in Swinford will reopen today following road works.</p>
      <p>It comes as a relief to the retail sector ahead of the busy Christmas shopping period.</p>
      <p>However, access will remain restricted on the Dublin Road in the town until early next week due to ongoing works.</p>
      <p>Local Councillor Michael Smyth said the patience and sacrifice of the residents and business people at the locations in question were greatly appreciated.</p>
      <p>The roadworks have been an imposition for parents and others who must travel through the town a number of times every day.</p>
      <p>â€œI am working with council and the contractor to get all the works completed as soon as possible. These works will enhance our town and the infrastructure will benefit residents and businesses alike," he added.</p>
