      <h1>Fabinho was once so adamant he wasn’t a midfielder he demanded contract clause to avoid it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:56:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Fabinho is now regarded as the world’s best holding midfielder.</p>
      <p>This calendar year, the Brazilian has been mindbogglingly good for Liverpool and is the team’s lynchpin at the heart of Jurgen Klopp’s central three.</p>
      <p>His job is incredibly hard as the two midfielders either side of him bomb forward and head towards the touchline, meaning he’s often covering a huge amount of ground by himself.</p>
      <p>Yet he’s done it with aplomb and has been a vital part of our recent success, which included a Champions League victory in June and a 97 point Premier League haul.</p>
      <p>But there was a time when the now 26-year-old was considered a right-back not only by his managers, but by the player himself.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/making-fabinho-counting-birds-jose-mourinhos-hotel-visit-jurgen/">Telegraph</a>, when extending his AS Monaco contract before Liverpool eventually came knocking, Fabinho insisted a clause in the deal stating he’d be used exclusively as a right-back!</p>
      <p>We cannot imagine this was agreed, as Fab began to establish a worldwide European reputation anchoring Monaco’s midfield – highlighted by their Ligue 1 success and run to the Champions League semi-finals.</p>
      <p>It’s worth remembering though that should Trent Alexander-Arnold either need a break, Fabinho is not the worst option for the role – although he’s best at no.6.</p>
