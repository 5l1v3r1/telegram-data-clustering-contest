      <h1>Kia wants us to go off-road with Seltos X-Line concepts</h1>
      <h2>Kia turns a pair of Seltos crossovers into rugged off-roaders</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:50:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author">AutoIndustriya.com</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this month, Kia Philippines officially launched the all-new Seltos crossover. Interestingly, we seem to have gotten the small crossover ahead of the US market. It was only this week did the US-spec Seltos made its debut at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show.</p>
      <p>Together with its launch, Kia also introduced the Seltos X-Line Concepts – a pair of stylish, off-road-ready concept versions of the Seltos crossover. The two concept off-roaders are called the Seltos X-Line Trail Attack Concept and the Seltos X-Line Urban Concept.</p>

      <p>Starting with the X-Line Trail Attack Concept, it is painted in a unique beige-orange color scheme. The X-Line Trail Attack Concept gets improved off-road capabilities thanks to a 2-inch lift, giving it around a total of 234 mm (9 inches) of ground clearance. 17-inch beadlock wheels are then wrapped in chunky off-road tires. Completing the exterior makeover are matte black overfenders, roof rack with fog lights, and a metal front bumper with more fog lights and a winch.</p>

      <p>If you find the X-Line Attack Concept a bit too rugged, then the X-Line Urban Concept may be more to your liking. The gray Seltos has more or less the same parts fitted such as the lift kit, and roof rack with fog lights. However, the bumper has been toned down and features only a small metal brush guard. A different set of 17-inch wheels has been fitted but with matching off-road tires. Topping it off is a new hood with a functional scoop.</p>

      <p>Both X-Line Concepts use the production-model Seltos’ 1.6-liter turbocharged engine which produces 175 horsepower and 264 Nm of torque that is paired to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. To give it full off-roading capabilities, it also comes with all-wheel drive and a center differential lock. For those wondering, yes all-wheel drive and diff lock is available on the production Seltos. Unfortunately, it is unlikely to make its way to local models.</p>

      <p>Despite looking cool as they are, it is unlikely that Kia will build a production version of the X-Line Concepts. At least, it gives owners an idea as to how they can modify their new Kia crossover.</p>
