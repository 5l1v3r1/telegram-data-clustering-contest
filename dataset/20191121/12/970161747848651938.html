        <b>Darts is coming to the ‘world’s most famous arena’ as the PDC’s World Series will land at Madison Square Garden, New York in June next year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The US Darts Masters has spent the last three years in Las Vegas but will be switching to the Hulu Theater at MSG for 2020.</p>
      <p>The World Series is a string of non-ranking events played over the summer and saw the invited players visit the US, Germany, Australia and New Zealand this year, before playing the World Series of Darts Finals in Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>The initiative has also seen the PDC visit the UAE, Singapore, Japan and China in the past.</p>
      <p>The World Series has never visited Madison Square Garden before, though, which PDC chairman Barry Hearn says could only have been ‘a pipe-dream’ in the past.</p>
      <p>‘This is a fantastic development for darts to be bringing the glitz and glamour of the World Series of Darts to the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden,’ said Hearn.</p>

      <p>‘This is a world-renowned venue and 20 years ago it would have been a pipe-dream for darts players to take to the stage in such an iconic arena – but this is another exciting move for us as the World Series continues to grow.</p>
      <p>‘Not only will this be special for the players competing, but this is a fantastic chance for fans to see the cream of the world’s darting talent under one roof on June 5-6.’</p>
      <p>The announcement came on the day that Hollywood A-lister gave a shout out to world number three Gerwyn Price after his Grand Slam of Darts triumph at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The actor tweeted: ‘Big ups to the Iceman @Gezzyprice for takin out MVG and the Eagle to win his second consecutive GSD.’</p>

      <p>The North American Championship, featuring just US and Canadian players, will be played on Saturday 6 June, with the winner getting a spot at the World Championship.</p>
      <p>The US Darts Masters will run from Friday to Sunday as the local players take on the invited stars of the PDC.</p>
      <p>The rest of the 2020 World Series is yet to be announced.</p>
