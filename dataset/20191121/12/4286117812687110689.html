      <p>The sources also said while there was no discussion on the distribution of the portfolios in the meeting, the Congress wants an equal distribution of the ministerial berths in the Maharashtra government.</p>
      <p>The Congress leaders held a meeting with the NCP leaders at Sharad Pawar's residence in Delhi on Thursday to discuss the modalities of an alliance with the Shiv Sena for government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>"Congress and the NCP both demand that Uddhav Thackeray should be the chief minister. Even the Shiv Sena Legislative party leader Eknath Shinde has said that the party MLAs want Uddhav Thackeray to be the Maharashtra chief minister," the sources told India Today TV.</p>
      <p>Sources present in the meeting said that while the word 'secular' has been dropped from the final CMP draft, in principle, there is a clear paragraph stating that the new government will abide by the ethos of the Preamble of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena MLAs are likely to fly to Jaipur in Rajasthan on Friday ahead of the party's meeting with the Congress in Mumbai.</p>

      <p>The Sharad Pawar-led party also demanded home, finance, PwD, water resources and rural development. On the other hand, Congress wants Speaker, finance, rural development and revenue. The NCP has not made any demand for a rotational chief minister.</p>
      <p>While Congress even asked the NCP about it but they kept mum, the sources have informed. All the issues would be discussed in Friday's meeting, sources said.</p>
      <p>Sources said the Congress wants equal distribution of portfolios which is 14-14-14 for the three parties. In the meeting, the NCP did not raise the demands for a rotational chief minister but did agree that Uddhav Thackeray should be the chief minister of the state.</p>
