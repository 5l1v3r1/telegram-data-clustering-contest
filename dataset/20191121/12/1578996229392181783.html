      <h1>Cody Simpson Breaks His Silence on Miley Cyrus Split Rumors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:26:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Early this week, a <a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/11/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-split-on-break-whirlwind-romance/">RadarOnline report</a> circulated claiming that Miley Cyrus and Cody Simpson were on a break. Cyrus did not respond to it on her Instagram Story, but Simpson made a subtle nod to it yesterday and confirmed to everyone that he and Cyrus were very much still together. He posted a photo of his phone background, which was a childhood photo of Cyrus. It's a pretty boyfriend-y thing to have as his screensaver and sends the subtle message that they're fine.</p>

      <p>Simpson's Instagram Story response comes shortly after a source spoke to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1094665/miley-cyrus-and-cody-simpson-are-still-together-and-crazy-about-each-other-despite-split-report">E!</a> about the rumors and how Simpson and Cyrus are definitely still dating. Cyrus has had a pretty minimal presence on social media as she recovers from her vocal chord surgery and remains on vocal rest for these next few weeks.</p>
      <p>"Miley and Cody saw each other last week when he visited her in Tennessee. They are fine and are still dating," a source told the outlet. "Miley has been resting from her vocal surgery but has been in touch and seen Cody recently."</p>
      <p>Their relationship isn't traditional, the source added: "Miley always made it clear to Cody that she likes to have freedom and he always understood the dynamic of the relationship. They have been friends for years and will always be, and are currently fine and on great terms."</p>
      <p>A second source explained that while work commitments kept them apart sometimes, they are always very happy to be together. "She has a busy schedule and a lot of work commitments that have kept them apart," the source said. "But when they are together there's no doubt they are crazy about each other."</p>
