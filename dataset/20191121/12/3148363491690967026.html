      <p>“As is normal for a CEO of a major U.S. company, Mark accepted an invitation to have dinner with the President and First Lady at the White House,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-hosted-zuckerberg-undisclosed-dinner-white-house-october-n1087986">NBC News.</a></p>
      <p>The dinner took place while Zuckerberg was in Washington, DC, for his scheduled testimony and private meetings with several members of Congress.</p>
      <p>Facebook board member Peter Thiel also joined the president and Zuckerberg for the dinner.</p>
      <p>Trump also met with Zuckerberg in September, sharing a picture of the meeting after it happened.</p>

      <p>The news of a private dinner drew outrage from Facebook and Trump critics, despite former President Barack Obama also spending a lot of time with Zuckerberg.</p>
      <p>In 2011, President Obama had<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/02/full-list-of-attendees-at-obama-tech-meeting-includes-ceos-from-twitter-netflix-oracle-yahoo-others.html"> dinner </a>with Zuckerberg and other tech leaders including Apple CEO Steve Jobs, outgoing Google CEO Eric Schmidt, then CEO of Twitter Dick Costolo, and Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix.</p>
      <p>Obama also participated in a Facebook town hall with Zuckerberg in 2011.</p>
      <p>“The first time we had dinner together and he wore this jacket and tie,” Obama <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/20/remarks-president-facebook-town-hall">recalled</a> about Zuckerberg. “I’d say halfway through dinner he’s starting to sweat a little bit. It’s really uncomfortable for him. So I helped him out of his jacket.”</p>
