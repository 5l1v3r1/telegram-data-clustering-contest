      <p>"Bread and butter? Not quite. We're all Irish on St. Patrick's Day – be sure your table staple is, too!" [The instructions recommend a <a href="https://www.tupperware.com/tupperwave-stack-cooker.html">TupperWave Stack Cooker</a> and <a href="https://www.tupperware.com/thatsar-bowl.html">Thatsa Bowl</a>.] </p>
      <h3>Irish Soda Bread with Stout Butter</h3>
      <p>Makes 10 servings</p>
      <p>
        <i>Ingredients:</i>
      </p>
      <p>3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour<br/>1 1/2 tsp. baking powder<br/>1 1/2 tsp. cream of tartar<br/>1 1/2 tsp. coarse kosher salt<br/>4 tbsp. salted butter, room temperature<br/>1 1/2 cups buttermilk<br/>2 tbsp. dark molasses<br/>2 tsp. toasted caraway seeds<br/>2 tbsp. salted butter, melted (optional)<br/>8 tbsp. unsalted butter (1 stick)<br/>1 1/2 tbsp. Irish stout<br/>2 tbsp. brown sugar </p>
      <p>
        <i>Preparation:</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Prep the dough</b> - Grease and flour 3-Qt. Casserole base and cone of the Tupperwave Stack Cooker. Place cone in center of Stack Cooker and set aside. In a Thatsa Large Bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, cream of tartar and salt. Rub butter into flour mixture until coarse crumbs form. Create a well in the center of the flour. In a Thatsa Mini Bowl, whisk together buttermilk and molasses. Pour buttermilk mixture into the well. Using a spatula or fork, pull flour into the buttermilk until a crumbly dough forms. Knead dough briefly until dry pieces just come together; do not overmix. Dough will look scrappy and uneven.</p>
      <p><b>Cook the dough</b> - Drop 3" pieces of dough into the buttered Stack Cooker, forming a loose ring of dough around the cone. If desired, pour 2 tbsp. of melted butter over the top of the dough. Microwave on high power, uncovered, 8 minutes. Remove from microwave. Let stand 10 minutes before removing from Stack Cooker.</p>
      <p><b>Make the glaze, store or serve</b> - Meanwhile, make the butter. In a Thatsa Medium Bowl, stir together butter, stout and sugar until well combined. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve. Serve with sliced Irish Soda Bread.</p>
