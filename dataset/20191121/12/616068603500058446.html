      <p>Behind every woman who reports a non-spousal sexual assault are 19 women who don’t.</p>
      <p>That statistic is behind a powerful image that has gone up across Vancouver to show the need for survivor support.</p>
      <p>The posters, put up by Battered Women’s Support Services, show a woman who has reported an assault, followed by 19 more in silhouette.</p>
      <p>According to Statistics Canada, of all sexual assault incidents perpetrated by someone other than a spouse, one in 20 was reported to police. In contrast, one in three incidents of other types of crime measured by the General Social Survey on Victimization are reported.</p>
      <p>“Using posters to illustrate this startling fact was a simple way to talk about a serious subject,” says Angela Marie MacDougall, executive director at Battered Women’s Support Services.</p>
      <p>“This was our way of getting people to think critically about violence against women and to enable survivors to know that there are avenues for them to access support, outside of the justice system, and that we’re a place for healing and we advocate for those who have experienced trauma or harassment.”</p>
