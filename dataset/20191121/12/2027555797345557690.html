      <h1>Pragya Thakur's inclusion in defence panel draws flak</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:31:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/shemin-joy" target="_blank">Shemin Joy</a></address>
      <p>A political controversy erupted over the inclusion of Bhopal MP Sadhvi Pragya Thakur in the Parliamentary Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Defence with the Opposition describing it as an "insult" to every Indian, military and Parliament.</p>
      <p>The panel headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has Farooq Abdullah, Sharad Pawar, J P Nadda, Sougata Roy, A Raja, Supriya Sule and Ramesh Jigajinagi as among others. There are 21 MPs who are part of the committee besides Minister of State for Defence Shripad Yesso Naik.</p>
      <p>Soon after the list of members came out in public domain, Congress tweeted, "Pragya Thakur, a terror accused and Godse fanatic has been nominated by the BJP government to be a member of the Parliamentary Panel on Defence. This move is an insult to our nation's defence forces, to our nation's esteemed parliamentarians and to every Indian." </p>
      <p>Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said the BJP government has just given the world a "new model of nationalism" by appointing an "under-trial in a bomb blast case as a consultant" on defence issues. "But don't worry rest is fine, Bharat Mata Ki Jai!" he said.</p>
      <p>Senior lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier said that he could not forgive the Malegaon blasts case accused after she termed Nathuram Godse a patriot. "But of course a terror accused is the most suitable person for deciding country's defence," he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Thakur, who is on bail in the Malegaon blasts case, had defeated Congress' Digvijay Singh in the Lok Sabha elections.</p>
