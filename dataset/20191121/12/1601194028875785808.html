      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/juventus">Juventus</a> might’ve started the 2010’s with a whimper rather than a bang – they finished seventh in Serie A under coach Luigi Delneri in the 2010/11 season – but the appointment of Antonio Conte and some tactical switches the following season saw something change, and since then <i>The Old Lady</i> have thoroughly dominated Italian football.</p>
      <p>Under Conte – and his successor Max Allegri, who took over at the Allianz Stadium in 2014 – Juve have won the Serie A title (<i>Scudetto</i>) in the last eight seasons, and have also reached the UEFA Champions League final on two occasions, coming up short both times.</p>
      <p>Over the decade they’ve been home to some genuine greats of the game, and it was actually hard to whittle their team of the 2010’s down to 11 men.</p>
      <p>Here, we take a look at the best players to have represented Juventus over the last 10 years and create a team of the decade for the Italian giants.</p>

      <h4>Defence</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Goalkeeper: Gianluigi Buffon</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Gianluigi Buffon is widely recognised as one of the best goalkeepers of all time</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Considered one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the sport, Gianluigi Buffon became a genuine Juventus legend during his incredible 17 years at the club, and while he won plenty of trophies in the 2000’s, his most successful moments undoubtedly came in the 2010’s.</p>
      <p>Not only did Buffon contribute heavily to seven of Juventus’ consecutive Serie A victories – from 2011/12 to 2017/18 – but he also set numerous records during that period, including the most consecutive clean sheets (10 in 2015/16), and the longest time without conceding a single goal (974 minutes in 2015/16).</p>
      <p>At the age of 40, the Italian legend moved to Paris St. Germain for the 2018/19, but after one season away he returned to Juventus in the summer and now looks set to end his career there as one of their most decorated players.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Centre-Back: Andrea Barzagli</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Andrea Barzagli became a club legend at Juventus</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>One of the defensive trio famously known as ‘BBC’, Italy’s Andrea Barzagli joined Juventus as a 30-year old journeyman in 2011 for a fee of just €300,000. But after struggling in his initial season under Luigi Delneri, things soon changed for him.</p>
      <p>When Antonio Conte took over the reins at Juve in the summer of 2011, Barzagli was transformed into an integral part of <i>the Old Lady’s </i>defence – and soon gained recognition as one of the best bargain signings of all time. He helped the club to concede just 20 goals in their 38 league games in 2011/12, and was practically an ever-present for the following seven seasons, all of which saw Juve win the <i>Scudetto</i>.</p>
      <p>Barzagli retired at the end of last season with a total of 281 appearances for Juventus and easily takes his spot in their best team of the decade.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Centre-Back: Giorgio Chiellini</b>
      </p>

      <p>Tough-tackling defender <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/giorgio-chiellini">Giorgio Chiellini</a> joined Juventus back in 2005, but while he was always a first teamer at the club, it took until this decade for him to really prove himself as a world-class player. Capable of playing at left-back as well as a central defender, the Italian international came into his own when Antonio Conte switched Juventus’ system to a three-man defence in 2011/12; alongside Andrea Barzagli and Leonardo Bonucci, the trio known as ‘BBC’ was formed.</p>
      <p>For the rest of the decade, Chiellini was one of Juventus’s best and most consistent performers, playing in the majority of their games and putting together a total of 339 appearances across 9 seasons. In that time he won 16 trophies with the club and was also named in the Champions League’s Squad of the Season on two occasions.</p>
      <p>Currently out of action due to an ACL tear, how much longer the now-35 year old Chiellini can continue is anyone’s guess, but there’s no doubt that he’ll be remembered as a Juventus legend.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Centre-Back: Leonardo Bonucci</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Leonardo Bonucci was named Serie A Footballer of the Year in 2015/16</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Renowned as one of the world’s best defenders over the past decade, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/leonardo-bonucci">Leonardo Bonucci</a> joined up with teammates Barzagli and Chiellini in the 2011/12 season to create one of Europe’s strongest three-man defences. Arguably the strongest ball-player of the three, Bonucci barely missed a game as Juventus began their dominant run, and the Italian won six consecutive <i>Scudettos</i> with the club.</p>
      <p>Over that period, Bonucci was named in the Serie A Team of the Year on three occasions, from 2014/15 to 2016/17, and was even named Serie A Footballer of the Year in 2015/16 as <i>The Old Lady </i>conceded just 20 goals in their 38 league games.</p>
      <p>A move to AC Milan in 2017 took many by surprise, but after a lone season at the San Siro that saw him struggle for his usual form, Bonucci was back at Juventus just one year later in a swap deal that saw Mattia Caldara head the other way. And basically, it was like he’d never been away; the Italian international made 29 appearances and picked up another <i>Scudetto</i> – confirming himself as one of Juventus’ players of the decade.</p>
