And once again, the internet proved why it’s undefeated, transforming the quirky shot into a collection of memes.</p>
      <p>The Best New Artist Award winner took to Instagram to have a good laugh at the internet’s clever creations. The memes inserted Walker into random situations, including the singer blasting off into space as a rocket and decked out in Popeye’s gear behind a cash register.</p>
      <p>“I’m really tired of this,” she wrote in the caption alongside a laughing emoji.</p>

      <p>Walker has had her battles with anxiety. Earlier this month, she had to <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/summer-walker-cancels-tour-dates-due-to-anxiety">cancel</a> a number of tour dates due to her anxiety issues, which she addressed on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t even gonna go today cause I was to scared,” Walker explained. “When I got there I dodged the red carpet and tried to get escorted through the back…BUT I pushed through my #socialanxiety today and I’m really glad I did.”</p>
      <p>Walker’s new collaboration with Chris Brown and London On Da Track, “Something Real,” premieres on Thursday (November 21).</p>
