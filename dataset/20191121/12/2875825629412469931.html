      <h1>Holly Willoughby baffled as Kem Cetinay says he thought reindeers were 'made up'</h1>
      <h2>Love Island star Kem Cetinay was left stunned when he met the animals - which he previously thought were just in fairy tales</h2>

      <p>Holly Willoughby was left very confused on This Morning today after former Love Island star Kem Cetinay said that he thought reindeers weren't real.</p>
      <p>Today, Kem ventured to the places in Norway that inspired Disney's Frozen ahead of the second film's release at the weekend.</p>
      <p>But the former Islander was stunned when he came face to face with a reindeer - which he had been convinced didn't exist.</p>
      <p>Meeting a woman called Ava, who looked after reindeers like Sven in Frozen, he went to see some in real life.</p>
      <p>But as he entered the pen, Kem quipped: "I didn't think reindeers were real, I'll be honest with you. I thought they were made up!"</p>

      <p>He also feared that the reindeers would bite him.</p>
      <p>After the VT, Phil said: "He is so funny."</p>
      <p>Holly added in disbelief: "He didn't think reindeers were real. Kem!"</p>
      <p>Earlier, viewers were left thoroughly creeped out by Sophia the Robot's sinister smile over terrified Holly Willoughby's remark.</p>
      <p>Sophia the Robot, hailed as the world's most intelligent robot, appeared on the sofa alongside her creator David Hanson.</p>

      <p>However hosts Holly and Phil were clearly unsettled by the robot's appearance, Phil pointed out that there is a "potential sinister side", to which the creator agreed but said that there was potential for good as well.</p>
      <p>Sophia rattled off her accomplishments, which included visiting 38 countries, and even drew a picture of Holly and Phil.</p>
      <p>But viewers noticed Sophia's creepy smile after Holly asked whether Sophia could turn on them if she got smarter.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "She's f***ing creepy that's what she is #notorobots #ThisMorning."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "THAT IS SO CREEPY #ThisMorning."</p>
