      <h1>The Sniper Elite Board Game Brings Slow-Mo X-Ray Headshots to a Tabletop Near You</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:16:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p><i>Sniper Elite</i> developer Rebellion is branching out into board games. The Oxford-based studio has unveiled <a href="https://rebellionunplugged.com/">Rebellion Unplugged</a>, a new team releasing new physical games based on the company's properties.</p>
      <p>The first of those will be based on the aforementioned Sniper Elite<i> </i>series. The resulting game is probably going to struggle to deal with the slow-mo x-ray cam that has made the series quite so recognisable but, either way, Rebellion is promising "a competitive stealth action game for two to four players." A Kickstarter campaign for the game is expected early next year, but you can try it out next month at PAX Unplugged if you happen to be in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Sniper Elite is the first game on Rebellion's schedule, but the developer says that "several" others "are already in the works." Given that the company also has the 2000 AD, Evil Genius, and Zombie Army IPs to its name, all of those seem relatively sure bets for their own tabletop adaptations. But as much fun as a Judge Dredd board game sounds, I'm keen to see how successfully Rebellion Unplugged can nail the feeling of getting that perfect slow-mo Hitler assassination.</p>
