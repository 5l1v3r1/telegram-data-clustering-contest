        <i>A famous crime novelist, an am-dram star and ‘the Moss Side tigress’ in a tribute to female friendship</i>
      </p>
      <p>In Dorothy L Sayers’s marvellous crime novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/06/gaudy-night-by-dorothy-l-sayers-a-weighty-novel-that-still-thrills"><i>Gaudy Night</i></a>, published in 1935, Harriet Vane – the sometime murder suspect beloved by the amateur sleuth <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/aug/23/top-10-crosswords-fiction-lord-peter-wimsey">Lord Peter Wimsey</a> – returns to her old Oxford college, a place very like Sayers’s own alma mater, Somerville. There, a series of poison pen letters begin to arrive, notes composed in language so obscene that the English don, the unworldly Miss Lydgate, can’t understand it – “the worst she knows comes from Restoration drama”. Perhaps, the modern reader might think, it’s the 30s version of internet trolls threatening clever women who speak their minds. Or perhaps the culprit is one of the dons herself, “the outcome of repressions sometimes accompanying the celibate life”. Or maybe it’s one of the students. Or one of the servants … Suspicions abound. Lord Peter, who is being kept firmly at arm’s length, is horribly alarmed; he thinks real violence isn’t far away. Lying beneath the crime story is a whole ocean of seething anxieties. Can one be both an independent woman and a wife? Is a life of scholarship somehow unnatural for women? What is female education for? As one of the characters asks: “Some of these clever ladies are a bit queer don’t you think, madam?”</p>
      <p>For the educated, middle-class women born in the 1890s, such questions loomed large. Formed to a great extent by the first world war, benefiting from the enlargement of the franchise in 1918 and 1928, given more opportunities than their foremothers in the workplace, they were nevertheless carving out their places in territory that was not only undiscovered, but often hostile. <i>Mutual Admiration Society</i> is a group biography of a circle of such women who became pals at Oxford, including Sayers; the cheekily named society of the title was a real club, whose members composed poetry and prose for each other’s delight.</p>
      <p>Aside from Sayers, none of the subjects is a household name, but, Mo Moulton argues, each lived a life worthy of our attention. Muriel St Clare Byrne was a playwright and a historian of the Tudor era, whose life’s work, from 1932 into the 1980s, was editing one of the great caches of Tudor letters (by Lord Lisle, an uncle of Henry VIII’s, who was lord deputy of Calais). She also wrote a memoir that TS Eliot published at the behest of Sayers, who persuaded him into it in an undefended moment on the dentist’s doorstep; he remembered that Byrne smoked the same kind of French cigarettes as he did. Sayers collaborated with Byrne, too: the crime novel <i>Busman’s Honeymoon</i> began as a play co-written by the two women.</p>
      <aside>One of the best things about the book is the way it refuses to heroise these women, heroic as they undoubtedly were</aside>
      <p>Byrne’s life partner was another Somervillian, Marjorie Barber, an inspiring English teacher at South Hampstead school in London. Byrne for a time also fell into a passionate affair with another woman, a situation that was quietly accommodated by the women’s friendship group, who also included Dorothy Rowe, another teacher and a leading light of the amateur theatre world in Bournemouth. This was no small thing: she founded a hugely successful organisation and built a theatre. D Rowe, as she was known, was clearly a splendid woman who emerges as a Margaret Rutherford-esque figure, jovially addressing friends in the am-dram world as “king of my heart” when she forgets a name. The final protagonist is Charis Frankenburg, who of all the group had the most apparently conventional life – comfortably off, happily married, mother to four children. She was an important pioneer of women’s reproductive rights, enduring hostility to establish family planning clinics in her home town of Salford. At one point, she was nicknamed “the Moss Side tigress”.</p>
      <p>One of the best things about Moulton’s book is the way it refuses to heroise these women, heroic as they undoubtedly were at times. But they were also complicated and singular, brimming with the ordinary prejudices of their time. Frankenburg was clearly a practical feminist, but also (not necessarily contradictorily of course) a dyed-in-the-wool Tory. With a Jewish father and a Jewish husband, she skirted identities; sometimes she was casually antisemitic, but at others, a staunch defender of Jewish individuals and causes. Sayers would not have defined herself as a feminist, certainly when young, but in the end her essay “Are Women Human?” of 1938 prefigures some of the questions of Simone de Beauvoir’s <i>The Second Sex</i>. Barber’s efforts to tolerate Byrne’s extra-curricular passion were certainly out of tune with current notions of female self-realisation (though she did, in the end, put her foot down).</p>
      <p>Where the book suffers is in its sturdily dutiful style; the wit and verve of its subjects can struggle to fly free from the pages. It lacks a sense of place and atmosphere. Occasionally continuity suffers as Moulton juggles the large cast; there are small but jarring errors of orthography (“honorary” and “humorous” are, oddly, misspelled throughout the work). Nevertheless, what touchingly emerges is the sense that through all the trials of heartbreak, bereavement and loss, it was friendship that persisted. It is a tribute to that precious but still unsung thing: the loving bond between female friends, based on intellectual exchange and deep affection.</p>
