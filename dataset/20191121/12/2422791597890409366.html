      <p>BEIJING - China's ruling Communist Party's newspaper has published surveillance video which it says proves the guilt of a former British Consulate employee in Hong Kong who was detained for 15 days on a charge of soliciting prostitution.</p>
      <p>The People's Daily report Thursday follows a detailed online account from the staffer, Simon Cheng, who says he was tortured, questioned about pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and forced to confess during his detention in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.</p>
      <p>The People's Daily denied he was tortured and said it obtained the video, which shows Cheng at a massage salon, from Shenzhen police. It does not offer concrete evidence that Cheng solicited prostitution, nor does it prove that he was not tortured.</p>
      <p>Cheng has acknowledged that he got a massage on his business trip.</p>
