      <h1>MSD’s Keytruda scores another EU okay, in head and neck cancer</h1>
      <h2>First anti-PD-1 drug to improve overall survival in first-line setting</h2>

        <b>The EMA has approved Merck &amp; Co/MSD’s Keytruda as a first-line treatment for head and neck cancer, a few months after it was cleared by the FDA with a slightly broader label.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/tags/keytruda?tag=S2V5dHJ1ZGE=&amp;cachebuster=1928060566">top-selling checkpoint inhibitor</a> has been given the green light by the EMA for previously-untreated metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in patients whose tumours express PD-L1, both as a monotherapy and in combination with platinum and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>The FDA approval was a little different, covering monotherapy with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in PD-L1 expressors, but allowing the combination regimen to be used in ‘all-comers’, i.e. regardless of a patient’s PD-L1 status.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Keytruda is the first anti-PD-1 drug to be cleared in Europe for this use, giving HNSCC patients a much-needed new treatment option and MSD’s drug another leg up over its rivals in the checkpoint inhibitor category such as Bristol-Myers Squibb’s <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/tags/opdivo?tag=T3BkaXZv&amp;cachebuster=485287041">Opdivo</a> (nivolumab).</p>
      <p>Keytruda is also the first PD-1 therapy to improve overall survival in first-line HNSCC, hitting that objective in the phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 study reported last year.</p>
      <p>In the trial, Keytruda as a monotherapy and in combination with chemo improved OS by 22% and 23%, respectively, compared to what has been the standard first-line treatment for this cancer for a decade – the EXTREME regimen of Eli Lilly’s Erbitux (cetuximab) with a platinum drug plus 5-FU – in the PD-L1-expressing group.</p>
      <p>As a monotherapy Keytruda proved to be non-inferior to EXTREME across all levels of PD-L1 expression, with a better safety profile and a response rate that was lower but much more long-lasting. The combination regimen outperformed EXTREME regardless of PD-L1 expression levels.</p>
      <p>After the KEYNOTE-48 results were published in <i>The Lancet</i> earlier this year, Keytruda alone and with chemo was billed as a “new standard of care” for HNSCC that represents “substantial progress for patients.”</p>
      <p>BMS says there were more than 705,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2018, causing more than 358,000 deaths, so the new indication represents a big new market for Keytruda, already <u><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/merck_cfo_were_not_only_about_keytruda_1314882">riding high</a></u> with sales rising 62% to $3.1bn in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>In Europe alone, it estimates there were more than 146,000 new cases and some 66,000 deaths from the disease last year.</p>
      <p>Keytruda also <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/opdivo_moves_closer_to_head_and_neck_cancer_approval_1076294">overtakes</a> Opdivo in HNSCC, which at the moment is only approved as a second-line therapy for this form of cancer after chemotherapy in both the US and Europe.</p>
