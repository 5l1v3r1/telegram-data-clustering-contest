      <p>A former Golden Eaglets star who played at the 1985 U-17 World Cup Chukwumah Nwaoha is critically down with a liver disease, Concise News has learned.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that Nwaoha won the competition with the team that included Nduka Ugbade, Jonathan Akpoborire, Fatal Atere and others.</p>
      <p>Presently, he is on admission at the Federal Medical Center (FMC) in Umuahia, Abia State and needs immediate surgery as he battles for his life.</p>
      <p>Nwaoha does not have the needed money to carry out the surgery and is pleading on Nigerians to help him.</p>
      <p>Following the team’s win at the World Cup in 1985, Nwaoha had a street named after him at the Housing Estate, Owerri, Imo State.</p>
      <p>The former footballer hails from Mbubo village in Umunna Nsulu Autonomous Community, Isiala-Ngwa North L. G.A, Abia State.</p>
