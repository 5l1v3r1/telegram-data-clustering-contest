      <p>It seems the negative virtue called ungratefulness can be found in the genes of <b>8 out of 10</b> Africans assembled especially Ghanaian musicians.</p>
      <p>This is because there have been many instances where budding artistes have had a scuffle with their managers after getting the needed recognition, the story of <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/i-paid-for-80-90-of-the-music-videos-i-shot-under-stonebwoy-kelvyn-boy-drops-more-secrets/">Kelvyn Boy and Stonebwoy as the two have dominated headlines lately for the wrong reasons.</a></p>
      <p>Back to the subject matter, <b>Ayisha Modi</b> who has worked with several artistes including <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/youth-of-ndc-to-beat-up-ofori-amponsah-for-advising-john-dramani-mahama/">Ofori Amponsah,</a> Kwesi Slay, <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/my-biggest-fear-is-not-making-it-to-heaven-obrafour/">Obrafour</a>,<a href="http://www.ghbase.com/terribonchaka-slim-buster-castro-are-the-greatest-ghanaian-artistes-of-all-time-julius-fakta/"> Castro</a> and Co. has added her voice to artistes being ingrate to their helpers.</p>
