      <p>Back when we originally introduced these two designs as t-shirts and other apparel, we had quite a few requests for posters. Unfortunately it wasn't an option with our print-on-demand service at the time — <b>but now it is!</b> So today we're launching posters for <a href="https://teespring.com/home-cooking-is-killing"><i>Home Cooking Is Killing Restaurants</i></a> and <a href="https://teespring.com/free-speech-pro-tip"><i>Free Speech Pro Tip</i></a>, alongside a relaunch of all the previously-available items.</p>
      <p>The posters are available in two sizes: 18x24 and 24x36. Plus, you can get the designs as <b>t-shirts, hoodies, mugs and stickers</b>. And don't forget about our recently-launched <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191107/09485143344/new-gear-techdirt-fourth-emojiment-first-one-too.shtml"><i>Fourth Emojiment</i> gear</a> (also available as a poster!) and all the other designs <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/techdirt">in our store on Teespring</a>.</p>
