      <h1>Sword and Shield Introduce an Even Rarer Form of Shiny Pokémon</h1>

      <p>In all my years of playing Pokémon, I've encountered just one shiny. The odds of such a meeting are already so small (1:4096) that, in 20 years, my shiny-hunting efforts amount to a single brown Liepard, a creature that's about to become even more worthless thanks to the discovery of a whole new, ultra-rare variant.</p>
      <p>In a tweet yesterday, well-known dataminer Kaphotics showed off a snippet of code from <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>, saying "Shiny Pokémon rarity has been split." While the odds of finding a shiny remain the same, there are now two different types. If you're relying on breeding or random encounters, one in every 16 shinies will have square or diamond-shaped sparkles, rather than the traditional star-shaped ones. According to Kaphotics, that puts the odds of finding a square shiny at 1:65536.</p>

      <p>If you're obsessed with hunting these ultra-rare creatures, however, there is a better way. Using the chain method (fighting the same Pokémon over and over again) will invert the odds, making 15 of every 16 shinies a square. Finding them will still be a slog, but it's one that's likely to prove fruitful for those most dedicated.</p>
