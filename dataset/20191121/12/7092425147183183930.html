        <b>Up to 16 people have been found alive in the back of a truck on a ferry which is en route to Rosslare Europort in Wexford.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is understood the discovery was made about 9.20am by a staff member who heard banging from inside the truck on a Stena ferry from France.</p>
      <p>All of the people involved are men aged between 20 and 40 years old, and it is believed they said they had travelled from Belgium up to five days ago.</p>
      <p>It is not known what nationality the people are but it is believed they may be from Asia.</p>
      <p>Gardai and paramedics are now waiting at Rosslare Europort for the ferry to dock at 3pm.</p>
