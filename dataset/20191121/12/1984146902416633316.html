      <p>Steve Bruce is 'quietly confident' <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/matty-longstaff">Matty Longstaff</a> will sign a new contract with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Longstaff's current deal runs out next summer and one of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce's</a> immediate priorities has been to tie down the 19-year-old to a new long-term deal.</p>
      <p>It was been a remarkable few months for Longstaff, who left a big impression on Bruce during the club's pre-season tour of China, and just a few weeks after scoring on his Premier League debut against <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , the midifelder made his international bow for England's under-20s.</p>
      <p>Lee Charnley, the Magpies' managing director, has been speaking to a number of players' representatives about new deals in recent months and Bruce is confident a breakthrough is imminent.</p>
      <p>"All of them things are still ongoing. Young Matty has been away, now played for England, represented his country, which we're all delighted about," he told reporters at his pre-match press conference ahead of Monday's trip to Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>"We're quietly confident we'll get that tied up over the next few weeks but, as I've said many times now, it seems to take forever - even with a young lad like Matty - but we're quietly confident that it will be OK."</p>
      <p>Longstaff has been an ever-present in the match day squad since firing Newcastle to victory against Manchester United last month and, with Isaac Hayden suspended, the midfielder kept his place against Chelsea and Wolves.</p>
      <p>The youngster's older brother, Sean, will miss the trip to Villa as he is serving the final game of his three-match ban after being sent off against Wolves.</p>
