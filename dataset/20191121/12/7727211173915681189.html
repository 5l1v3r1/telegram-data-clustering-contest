      <p>Coronation Street fans were left stunned last night when character Daniel Osbourne revealed his real age.</p>
      <p>It seems that Daniel, who is played by Rob Mallard, is much younger than <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Corrie</a> viewers had imagined.</p>
      <p>In a conversation with Adam Barlow, Daniel shared his concern about bringing up baby son Bertie alone following the death of his wife <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/sinead-tinkers-life-coronation-street-17150476">Sinead Tinker</a> last month</p>
      <p>As Daniel opened up to his nephew, he revealed that he was 24-years-old, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/coronation-street-fans-stunned-over-20926665">the Mirror reports.</a></p>
      <p>This is a fact, given that the character - the son of Ken Barlow and Denise Osbourne - was born 4th January 1995.</p>
      <p>Daniel will celebrate his 25th birthday in January, but fans couldn't believe how young he was.</p>
      <p>But the actor who plays him is actually 27.</p>
      <p>Expecting the character to be much older, fans took to Twitter to share their surprise.</p>
      <p>One viewer said: "Daniel's only 24?"</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: "Genuinely didn’t think Daniel was only 24 omg can’t believe I’m older than him."</p>
      <p>A third added of the surprise: "I had no idea."</p>
      <p>This view was echoed by another fan who said: "WHAT?! NO WAY. I thought he was like 30..."</p>
