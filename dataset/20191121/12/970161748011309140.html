      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> made a very good first impression on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> squad on his first day in charge, with many of the players surprised by how different he is in person to the image he portrays.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach signed a deal until 2023 to replace <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>, who was sacked just five months after reaching the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> final following a disappointing start to the new season.</p>
      <p>He was unveiled on Wednesday morning and took charge of his first training session in the afternoon, having assembled a new look backroom team for his reign at Spurs.</p>

      <p>Mourinho cut an increasingly sullen and irritable figure during his final months at Manchester United, while he has a reputation for being a hard manager to work under, isolating a number of players at Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>He is believed to have tried to reform his image during his time out of the game and the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-have-no-plans-to-make-jose-mourinho-work-under-a-sporting-director-just-yet-a4292816.html?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574336008">Evening Standard</a> report that the squad were taken back by how engaging and friendly their new manager is.</p>
      <p>Mourinho took the time to speak to each player individually, outlining his plan for them, and also addressed the group as a whole.</p>
      <p>Training footage shared by Tottenham showed a much more relaxed Mourinho than the one that left United, laughing and joking with the players.</p>
      <p>After Wednesday’s rigorous first session he shared a chat with Dele Alli, gave Eric Dier and Giovani Lo Celso pats on the head and embraced Harry Kane, walking off with the striker as they left the training pitches.</p>

      <p>Mourinho is believed to have <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/jose-mourinho-told-harry-kane-private-text-message-tottenham-appointment-11192586/">texted Kane immediately upon being announced</a> as Spurs’ new manager, telling him he rates the striker as one of the best in Europe and promising to deliver silverware.</p>
      <p>Tottenham are currently in 14th place in the Premier league table, 11 points adrift of the top-four places, and Mourinho will take charge of his first game on Saturday lunchtime away to West Ham.</p>
