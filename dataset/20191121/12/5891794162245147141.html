      <h1>IAEA To Press Iran Over Suspected Undeclared Nuclear Site</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:50:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author">RFE/RL</a></address>
      <p>The UN's nuclear watchdog has asked Iran for details on why traces of uranium were found at an undeclared site after Iranian officials failed to provided information about the discovery.</p>
      <p>The issue has added to tensions over Iran's moves to breach a landmark 2015 deal aimed at curbing its nuclear activities.</p>
      <p>"It is essential that Iran works with the agency to resolve this matter promptly," Cornel Feruta told the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) board of governors in Vienna on November 21.</p>
      <p>The IAEA said in a report made public last week that its inspectors had "detected natural uranium particles of anthropogenic origin at a location in Iran not declared to the agency."</p>
      <p>"We have continued our interactions with Iran since then, but have not received any additional information and the matter remains unresolved," Feruta said.</p>
      <p>The IAEA has not named the site in question, but inspectors are believed to have taken samples from a location in Tehran's Turquzabad district where Israel has alleged secret atomic activity in the past.</p>
      <p>The discovery of uranium particles of man-made origin at a location that has not been declared comes as the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers threatens to collapse.</p>
      <p>The United States in May last year pulled out of the agreement and started to reinstate punishing sanctions on Tehran, leaving the other signatories struggling to salvage the accord.</p>
      <p>Over the past few months Iran has breached several parts of the pact, under which it committed to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>
      <p>On November 18, the IAEA confirmed that Iran's stock of heavy water for reactors had surpassed the 130-ton limit set under the nuclear deal.</p>
