      <h1>Kim Kardashian Is the Only Sister to Talk About Kylie Jenner Making $600M on Kylie Cosmetics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:49:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Kylie Jenner sold <a href="https://www.elle.com/beauty/a29833265/kylie-jenner-coty-sold-kylie-cosmetics/">51 percent of her Kylie Cosmetic and Kylie Skin stakes</a> to Coty for $600 million, a major business deal for the young billionaire that made global headlines. But there was no series of Kardashian-Jenner congratulations posts on Instagram. Fans (and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7703211/Jealous-Kylie-Jenners-Kardashian-siblings-social-media-plug-projects.html">The Daily Mail</a>) noticed not one sister responded to Jenner's big news.</p>
      <p>Kim Kardashian now has...because she was asked about it in an interview. She's the only one to talk about it yet. <i><a href="https://www.etonline.com/kim-kardashian-reacts-to-kylie-jenners-600-million-deal-exclusive-136750">Entertainment Tonight</a> </i>asked Kardashian about Jenner's big deal while she was promoting her SKIMS shapewear line with them. Kardashian had nice, big sister things to say about Jenner's $600 million sale.</p>
      <p>"I've known that selling her business was always in the works for her for a long time," Kardashian started "A lot of companies were bidding and really wanted to buy her brand, and so selling just about half of it was a decision that she made about a year ago and, you know, that she wanted to."</p>
      <p>"I'm so proud of her," Kardashian continued. "To think in her early 20s, she built a business off of something that she first was insecure about and finding confidence and, you know, just tapping into that and figuring out how to make an amazing product and just being true to herself and doing what she loves to do, that's so inspiring and so amazing and I'm so proud of her."</p>
      <p>Jenner is the only billionaire in the family (though Kris Jenner isn't far behind with her <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/kris-jenner-net-worth/">estimated net worth of $90 million</a>). Kim Kardashian's estimated net worth is<a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/models/kim-kardashian-net-worth/"> $350 million</a>, Kourtney Kardashian's is $45 million, Khlo√© Kardashian's is <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/khloe-kardashian-net-worth/">$50 million</a>, and Kendall Jenner's is <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/models/kendall-jenner-net-worth/">$40 million</a>.</p>
