      <h1>Tyler, The Creator Talks Liking Women &amp; Having Sex With Men</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:55:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author">Yohance Kyles (@HUEYmixwitRILEY)</a></address>
      <p>The award-nominated rap star appears on the cover of GQ magazine.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b><i> </i>Tyler, The Creator tried to come off as apathetic to getting a <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/dreamville-meek-mill-21-savage-tyler-the-creator-ybn-cordae-earn-best-rap-album-grammy-nominations-tPEk2xhvgE6tkZ5QiCd2Xg/">Best Rap Album Grammy nomination</a> for<i> Igor.</i> On Wednesday afternoon, the Odd Future founding member just <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/lizzo-lil-nas-x-h-e-r-meek-mill-more-react-to-earning-grammy-nominations-RPtkkF0irE-vx3hYRj4-kQ/">tweeted</a>, “uhhhhh, i guess.”</p>
      <p>Fans of Tyler know he likes to troll about nearly anything, including awards shows and his sexuality. <i>Igor</i> garnered a lot of attention for centering around the protagonist being involved in a love triangle with a man and a woman which added to the speculation that Tyler is either gay or bisexual.</p>
      <p>He further fed into the rumors again during a feature story for <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/tyler-the-creator-provocateur-of-the-year-2019/amp"><i>GQ</i></a>. The article quotes Tyler saying, “I like girls - I just end up f*cking their brother every time.” Like with many of his comments, it’s not clear if the 28-year-old musician was joking or if there was a hint of truth to the statement.</p>
      <p>Early in his career, Tyler was accused of promoting homophobic themes. His frequent use of "f*ggot" in his lyrics and on Twitter was met with backlash, but he insisted he was not prejudiced against the LGBT+ community. </p>
