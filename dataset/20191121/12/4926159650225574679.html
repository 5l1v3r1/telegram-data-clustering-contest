      <h1>Ronsford Beaton suspended from bowling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:11:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">ESPNcricinfo staff</a></address>
      <p>Guyana pacer <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/498440.html">Ronsford Beaton</a> has been suspended from bowling by Cricket West Indies with immediate effect after his action was deemed illegal by an independent assessor at Loughborough University, an ICC accredited testing centre for suspect bowling actions. Beaton's action was found to be in breach of the permitted 15 degrees under the playing regulations.</p>
      <p>The pacer was reported during <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8853/scorecard/1203631/guyana-vs-united-states-of-america-group-b-super50-cup-2019-20">Guyana's game</a> against the United States last Monday in the Super50 Cup, and he will now undergo remedial work under the supervision of the franchise, following which he can apply for a reexamination.</p>
      <p>Curiously, this isn't the first time Beaton has faced suspension over a suspect action. After only his second ODI appearance against New Zealand in December 2017, the pacer was reported and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23379149/ronsford-beaton-suspended-bowling-international-cricket">later suspended</a> after failing an independent assessment of his action. But he successfully remodelled his action in the subsequent months, and was <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/24503973/west-indies-ronsford-beaton-cleared-bowl-again">cleared to bowl</a> again in late August 2018.</p>
      <p>Beaton has played two ODIs for West Indies, both in December 2017.</p>
