      <h1>'Wrong way' - Nottingham Forest flop wants to make headlines for right reasons at new club</h1>
      <h2>Jason Cummings has been on the receiving end of negative publicity at times during his career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:21:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author">James Pallatt</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> flop Jason Cummings is determined to "be in the headlines for the right reasons".</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old striker has been on the receiving end of negative publicity at times during his career, including the time <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/like-hannibal-lecter-nottingham-forest-3392215">he trashed his flat</a> during a loan spell away from the City Ground at Peterborough last season - a moment of stupidity that was caught on video.</p>
      <p>Cummings left the Reds in a permanent switch to Shrewsbury Town earlier this season - and one of his teammates at the League One club says the Scotland international, who has scored four goals in 12 games for his new club, is eager for people to talk about his performances on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“I think (at times) he’s come across in the wrong way and there was one or two things that came out but I never saw that in him," Sean Goss told the Shropshire Star.</p>
      <p>“I know he wants to get his head down and be in the headlines for the right reasons which is scoring goals."</p>
