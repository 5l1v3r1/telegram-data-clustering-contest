        <b>Amazon is hiring for a new Amazon Game Streaming service for Twitch to compete with Microsoft’s Project xCloud and the recently released Google Stadia. </b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-stadia-wants-to-be-the-future-of-gaming-so-do-microsoft-sony-and-amazon/">A new report from website CNET</a> reveals that Amazon is moving forward with plans to create an all-new video game streaming service for its customers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/amazon-game-streaming-is-looking-like-a-reality/">The news was originally hinted at earlier this year</a>. A report from The Information  revealed that the project was in pre-production to combat the rising popularity of streaming services.</p>
      <p>Despite being in pre-production, it was revealed that Amazon was in talks with developers and publishers to create games for the service.</p>
      <p>This new report goes into further detail on what we can expect from Amazon’s offering. While <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-stadia-vs-project-xcloud/">Microsoft’s Project xCloud uses the power of Microsoft Azure</a>, Amazon Game Streaming will be powered by the company’s AWS cloud technologies.</p>
      <p>Just like with Google’s plan to incorporate Stadia into YouTube (if Google ever figures out what its actually doing), Amazon is planning on integrating their competitor into Twitch. Amazon claims that this will allow them to sell games similar to classic “arcade communities”.</p>
      <p>“We believe the evolution that began with arcade communities a quarter at a time, growing to the live streams and e-sports of today, will continue to a future where everyone is a gamer and every gamer can create, compete, collaborate and connect with others at massive scales,” reads a hiring description for the service.</p>
      <p>However, just like how gamers are wary of Google’s tendancies to cancel services a few years down the line, Amazon faces similar struggles in the world of gaming.</p>
      <p>From the cancellation of internal development projects to the alleged abandonment of Amazon Lumberyard, should gamers trust Amazon? <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/amazon-game-studios-layoffs-e3/">With the company laying off a large percentage of its internal development staff under the buzz of the year’s biggest gaming event, E3</a>, the publisher has little luck or patience with games.</p>
