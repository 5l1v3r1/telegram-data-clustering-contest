      <p>A former prison officer at a detention centre has denied misconduct in a public office and a string of sexual offences and assaults against young inmates dating back to the 1970s.</p>
      <p>Ian Nicholson, 74, who worked at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/medomsley-detention-centre-scandal-national-17101541">Medomsley Detention Centre</a> in County Durham, appeared before a judge at Teesside Crown Court to plead not guilty to all eight offences that he faces.</p>
      <p>Co-accused Alexander Flavell, 86, who is also charged with misconduct and sexual offences from his time working at the detention centre was not asked to enter pleas, pending the outcome of a medical examination.</p>
      <p>Nicholson, who used a walking aid to leave court, faces a charge of misconduct in a public office, three counts of a serious sexual offence and four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Judge Howard Crowson listed the four-week trail to take place next November and granted both men unconditional bail.</p>
      <p>He told them: "I'm afraid the trial is a very long way off."</p>
      <p>The judge imposed a reporting restriction which prevents the media from publishing either defendant's address.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/medomsley-detention-centre-scandal-national-17101541">Medomsley Detention Centre</a> closed in 1988 and was intended to house teenagers who had committed relatively minor offences.</p>
