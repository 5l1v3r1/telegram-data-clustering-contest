      <p>Following the statement from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/buckingham-palace/">Buckingham Palace</a> that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> is to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/queen-gives-prince-andrew-permission-step-back-public-duties-epstein-links-11190989/">withdraw from all Royal duties over his association with Jeffrey Epstein</a> and the ongoing unanswered questions surrounding the case, one question very much on the minds of everyone following the scandal is where is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jeffrey-epstein/">Jeffery Epstein</a>’s ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell?</p>
      <p>Ghislaine Maxwell was an associate and alleged former girlfriend of Epstein’s and is also the woman accused of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/08/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abused-girls-aged-young-14-10133855/">recruiting girls to be exploited and abused</a> by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epstein-financier-reportedly-died-suicide-prison-10550126/">the convicted sex offender</a>.</p>
      <p>Maxwell has been accused of acting as Epstein’s ‘madam’, but she has denied those allegations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/24/jeffry-epsteins-madam-made-visits-prince-andrew-buckingham-palace-10624082/">Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell became friends</a> after the Prince split from wife, Sarah Ferguson, in 1996.</p>
      <p>During the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">Duke of York’s highly-criticised interview with the BBC</a> at the weekend, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-interview-11166664/">the royal revealed to Emily Maitlis</a> that he had seen Maxwell as recently as earlier this year admitting that he had last seen his long-term friend: ‘in the spring, summer. She was here doing some rally.’</p>

      <p>Andrew denied that the meeting had taken place after Epstein’s arrest and told Maitlis that he and Maxwell hadn’t discussed Epstein at all.</p>

      <p>‘There wasn’t anything to discuss about him because he wasn’t in the news,’ Andrew said. ‘You know, it was just… we had moved on.’</p>

      <h3>Where is Jeffery Epstein’s ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell now?</h3>
      <p>While Prince Andrew has confirmed that Ghislaine was definitely in the UK earlier this year before taking part in a charity motoring rally from London to Monte Carlo, the exact whereabouts of Maxwell now is not known.</p>
      <p>Maxwell has withdrawn from public life and has not been seen out in public since finding herself at the center of an FBI inquiry.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7352813/Ghislaine-Maxwell-consort-Jeffrey-Epstein-living-mansion-outside-Boston.html">The Daily Mail</a> reports that Maxwell has been: ‘laying low in a New England beach town’ while her relationship with Epstein has been under interrogation.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old is allegedly reluctant to venture out into the public and it is not known if she is still living in the $3million (£2.3m) mansion in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, where neighbours say she had previously lived.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week Attorney General William Barr said in no uncertain terms: ‘Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein. Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice and they will get it.’</p>
