      <h1>2021 Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 Takes Luxury To New Heights</h1>
      <h2>Maybach’s super posh first SUV won’t come cheap.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Karl Furlong</a></address>
      <p>There's a new boss in the full-size SUV segment in the form of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/maybach-gls">Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600</a>, the first-ever SUV to wear the coveted Maybach badge. Representing the ultimate in luxury, technology, refinement, and comfort that have been highlights of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/maybach-s">Mercedes-Maybach S</a> sedan, the GLS 600 blends these qualities with the elevated seating position and the robust profile of an SUV. Yesterday, we <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/ultra-luxury-maybach-gls-suv-shows-its-face">got a teaser of the Maybach SUV's face</a>, and now we get to see it in all its glory as it debuts at the Auto Guangzhou in China today.</p>
      <p>Powering the ultra-lavish Maybach is a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 with EQ Boost and a 48-volt onboard electrical system. The V8 on its own is good for 550 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque, with the EQ Boost adding up to 21 hp and 184 lb-ft.</p>

      <p>Effortless performance is the order of the day, with the Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 hitting 60 mph in a claimed 4.8 seconds on its way to a top speed of 130 mph. Not bad for a 204.9-inch hulk of an SUV with massaging seats and a Burmester high-end 3D surround sound system that effectively shuts out any hint of what's happening in the outside world.</p>
      <p>Still, it's not quite performance on the level of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bentley/bentayga">Bentley Bentayga</a> W12, but the Mercedes-Maybach is more about ultimate comfort and status than outright power. It takes just one look at the bespoke cabin to confirm this, with tasteful finishes and Maybach-specific touches that set this beauty apart from the standard GLS.</p>

      <p>To ensure that passengers are fully isolated from the utter inconvenience of road scars, the GLS 600 gets a clever e-active body control suspension system that's partially powered by the 48V onboard electrical system. Not only are the spring and damping forces individually controlled at each wheel, but Road Surface Scan and a Curve inclination function also work together to provide superlative comfort for the driver and fortunate passengers.</p>
      <p>The sumptuous rear quarters can be specified with individual Executive Rear Seats, turning the GLS 600 into a four-seater. A rear-seat entertainment system, folding tables, heated and ventilated seats, comfort headrests, and a seven-inch MBUX tablet are all available amenities.</p>

      <p>As owners exit their private jets and board this luxury yacht for the road, they'll take pride in noticing that this Maybach doesn't look like an ordinary GLS. Two-tone paintwork, a Maybach-exclusive grille, fully retracting Maybach running boards, and 22-inch light-alloy wheels all scream grandeur.</p>
      <p>The 2021 Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 is set to go on sale in the US in the second half of 2020. Pricing is still to be announced, but considering that the top-line Mercedes-Maybach S sedan goes for over $200,000, don't expect to pay any less than that for this grand SUV.</p>
