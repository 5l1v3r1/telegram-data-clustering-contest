        <b>There is a devastating start to 2020 for Coronation Street couple <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fiz/">Fiz Stape</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennie-mcalpine/">Jennie McAlpine</a>) and Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) when sinister nanny and tutor Jade Rowan (Lottie Henshall) executes an evil plot to have their children Hope and Ruby taken away from them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ever since Jade arrived to support troubled Hope’s education, viewers have been wary that there is something not right with her and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/who-is-jade-in-coronation-street-and-what-is-she-really-up-to-with-fiz-and-tyrone-11017727/">it has become clear that she has a vendetta against the family as she secretly plots againt them.</a></p>
      <p>And in an upsetting turn of events, she will manage to paint the loving parents as unsuitable to take care of the kids, leading to social services becoming involved. As Fiz and Tyrone face losing their kids, they have a fight on their hands as wicked Jade steps up her campaign against her bosses. But just what is her grudge and how far is she prepared to go in order to destroy them?</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10388454/corries-fiz-tyrone-social-services/">A source told The Sun</a>: ‘The couple will be completely blindsided by having their children taken off them and at a loss as to how it could have happened. But it is actually Jade that has reported them to social services for allegedly abusing Hope and Tyrone’s daughter, Ruby.</p>

      <p>‘They are taken away from the couple while an investigation into the claims is carried out. In the meantime Fiz and Tyrone face 2020 wondering what happened to their family.’</p>
      <p>As Fiz and Tyrone try to work out why Jade has done this and how they can prove their innocence, Jade herself vanishes but Evelyn Plummer (Maureen Lipman) manages to track the spiteful nanny down.</p>
      <p>But how far will she go to get to the truth about Jade’s actions – and could she make things worse for Fiz and Tyrone in the process?</p>
