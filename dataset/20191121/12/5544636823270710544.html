      <p>The installation of four additional Emirs in Kano State has been nullified by the state High Court, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>The presiding judge, Justice Usman Na’abba ruled that the creation of the Emirates and subsequent appointment of four new first-class Emirs did not follow due process.</p>
      <p>Justice Na’bba also ruled that the State House of Assembly violated the provision of section 101 of the 1999 constitution which allows the assembly to make laws.</p>
      <p>He then declared the creation null and void.</p>
      <p>Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State had earlier in May assented the bill seeking the establishment of four additional first-class Emirates – Rano, Gaya, Karaya and Bichiin.</p>
      <p>The governor assented the bill following its passage by the Kano State House of Assembly. He later in the month presented letters of appointment to the four new first-class Emirs during a ceremony held at the state capital.</p>
      <p>Those presented with the letters of appointment include Aminu Ado Bayero, the son of Late Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, as the Emir of Bichi; Ibrahim Abulkadir as the Emir of Gaya; Tafida Abubakar as the Emir Of Rano and Abubakar Ibrahim II as the Emir of Karaye.</p>
      <p>Ganduje during the presentation said the creation of the four Emirates will make Kano traditional system more efficient.</p>
      <p>The creation of the new Emirates was however met with controversy as four Kano State kingmakers filed a suit against Ganduje and the State Assembly.</p>
      <p>The kingmakers who took the legal action are Madakin Kano, district head of Dawakintofa; Yusuf Nabahani, district head of Wudil; Abdullahi Sarki-Ibrahim, district head of Gabasawa; and Bello Abubakar, district head of Dambatta, Mukhtar Adnan.</p>
      <p>It was learned that the creation of the new emirates was to reduce the power of Emir Sanusi who reportedly worked against the governor’s reelection.</p>
