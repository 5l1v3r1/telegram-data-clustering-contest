      <h1>Joe Schmidt says Rory Best considered retiring from rugby after outrage over his attendance of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding's rape trial</h1>
      <h2>Best and Iain Henderson attended the trial in Belfast on a day off for the Ireland team in 2018</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:06:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/robert-hynes/" target="_blank">Robert Hynes</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/joe-schmidt">Joe Schmidt</a> has revealed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rory-best">Rory Best</a> considered retiring from rugby over the outrage of him appearing at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/paddy-jackson">Paddy Jackson</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/stuart-olding">Stuart Olding</a>'s rape trial.</p>
      <p>Best and Iain Henderson attended <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/paddy-jackson-and-stuart-olding-rugby-rape-trial">the trial of the men</a>, who were both acquitted, in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/belfast">Belfast</a> on a day off for the Ireland team in 2018.</p>
      <p>Best's decision to appear as a character witness caused such controversy at the time that not only did he consider relinquishing the Ireland captaincy, but he considered walking away from the sport completely.</p>
      <p>The hashtag #NotMyCaptain trended on Twitter as people called for the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ulster-rugby">Ulster</a> legend to step down as captain.</p>
      <p>Writing in his new autobiography Ordinary Joe, seen by the Irish Times, Schmidt said: “None of the management were aware that the two players were going to attend, and the outrage that followed was difficult for everyone in the group.</p>

      <p>“It was uncomfortable for all of us but it particularly magnified the stress that Rory was under, and he considered relinquishing the captaincy.”</p>
      <p>Schmidt added: “He even thought about walking away from the game completely, such was the fallout for his family and those around him.”</p>
      <p>Both Jackson and Olding were found not guilty of raping a woman after a nine-week trial at Laganside Courts in Belfast which ended in March, 2018.</p>

      <p>Best, who has now retired from rugby, went on to lead Ireland to the Grand Slam after his appearance at the trial with Schmidt's side beating England 24-15 in their final game at Twickenham.</p>
      <p>He previously spoke of the "really, really difficult time" he went through after attending the trial.</p>
      <p>He said: "The hardest thing for me was to try and guide Ulster through it while I was getting so much abuse myself. There were a lot of people calling for me to step down, and I think the thing that got me through it was, ultimately, the support that Joe [Schmidt] and the senior players within Ireland gave me.</p>
      <p>"I feel that it's a lesson I hope my kids take from it. If you have friends that are in trouble and they need a bit of help and support, and if they are promising you that they have done nothing wrong, even though people may not think it's the right thing to do, I think it is.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately, nobody came out of the process a winner in the slightest. From an Ulster point of view, I was just glad to get it all to bed so we could concentrate on the tail end of the season and actually playing rugby."</p>
