      <h1>IUML on a sticky wicket over Ayodhya verdict</h1>
      <h2>Focus on party leadership’s future course of action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:37:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Biju-Govind-235/" target="_blank">Biju Govind</a></address>
      <p>The recent Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya land dispute case has apparently left the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leadership struggling to strike a golden mean between hawkish elements and the party-backed Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the verdict, the party had taken a stand to ‘‘accept” the judgment with forbearance and asked the people not to be swayed by attempts to provoke intolerance.</p>
      <p>But after the verdict, the leadership took a moderate stand saying that the party “respects” the verdict and asked workers to exercise self-restraint.</p>
      <h3>Disappointing</h3>
      <p>Less than a week later, a special meeting of the party held in Malappuram termed the apex court verdict as “disappointing” and formed a committee to hold discussions with various Muslim organisations and like-minded secular organisations to decide the future course of action.</p>
      <h3>Critical views</h3>
      <p>Already the Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama, a powerful body of the Sunnis, has been critical of the ‘‘inert attitude’’ of the party even as various other Muslim organisations, from the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Popular Front of India, being more vocal against the verdict.</p>
      <p>Its president Syed Mohammed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal has even deputed organisation general secretary K. Alikutty Musaliar to attend a meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on November 24.</p>
      <p>The Samastha also attested to the viewpoint of the AIMPLB against accepting the five-acre alternative land given for a mosque and wanted to file a review petition against the verdict.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, IUML State president Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal is also the vice president of the Samastha.</p>
      <h3>Post-Babri role</h3>
      <p>What troubles the IUML leadership is that the situation in the State is different from the period when the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, 1992.</p>
      <p>Then the IUML had played a pivotal role in maintaining harmony when the country erupted in communal flare-up even as hardcore members walked out of the party to form the Indian National League.</p>
      <p>However, the incident has also spawned several fundamentalist outfits though the party had extensively worked to keep the Muslim youths straying towards extremism.</p>
      <h3>Hindu votes</h3>
      <p>Now the IUML, being a major partner in the Congress-led United Democratic Front, also depended on Hindu votes for its electoral survival in many Assembly segments in Kozhikode, Malappuram, and Kannur districts.</p>
      <p>How the party carries the day within itself as well as in the political spectrum is to be seen at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is making a determined bid to gain a foothold in the State.</p>
