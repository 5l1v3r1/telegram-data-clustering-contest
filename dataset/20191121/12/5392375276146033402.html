      <p>Xiaomi: MIUI Launcher will be even more organized with next update<br/>4.3 (86%) 10 votes</p>
      <p>Little by little, Xiaomi seems to want to bring the best of Poco Launcher (present in Pocophone F1) to MIUI Launcher. As we recently learned, the company will finally bet on an application drawer, but it won’t stop there.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-tests-categories-app-drawer-miui-launcher/">XDA-Developers</a> reveals, Xiaomi is working on how to bring organization into that same application drawer. Like on the Poco Launcher, the method will be through categories.</p>
      <p>As you can see in the images below, you will be able to control everything in the settings of the future application drawer. Then you can categorize applications by predefined categories or create your own categories.</p>

      <h3>You’ll be able to configure and create your own categories</h3>
      <p>This feature was previously discovered in an alpha version of MIUI Launcher. As with Poco Launcher, it will surely please those who like to have the applications properly organized.</p>

      <p>Please note that it has already been confirmed by <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> that the application drawer will soon reach MIUI 11. However, the company has not yet talked about this category functionality.</p>
      <p>Once the application drawer is introduced into MIUI 11, categories are most likely to be placed at the same time. However, there is no official information on when this feature will reach users. Until then, you can use both with Poco Launcher.</p>
