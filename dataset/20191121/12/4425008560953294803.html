      <h1>ATO extends Leidos' IT support deal once more for $87m</h1>
      <h2>Now worth $358m over 11 years.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:50:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/justin-hendry-1167397" target="_blank">Justin Hendry</a></address>
      <p>The Australian Taxation Office has extended the support component of its long-running end user computing deal with Leidos by another two-and-a-half years and an extra $87.1 million.</p>
      <p>The IT services business that <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/lockheed-completes-exit-from-aussie-it-market-435008">formerly belonged to Lockheed Martin</a> said on Thursday that it had secured a "follow-on contract" with the agency to continue providing enterprise service management centre (ESMC) services.</p>
      <p>The contract, which sits alongside the company’s other major ATO contract for <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/leidos-lands-another-119m-for-atos-end-user-computing-513768">end user technology support services (EUTS)</a>, covers IT service desk and service management.</p>
      <p>Both contracts form part of the ATO’s end user computing bundle – one of three that were signed with suppliers in 2010 and which are now <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/ato-prepares-massive-it-outsourcing-shake-up-516467">facing a shakeup as part of a new IT sourcing approach</a>.</p>
      <p>The support component of the deal last grew by $29.8 million in July 2018 after it was extended out to 30 June 2019.</p>
      <p>But with the new extension, the ESMC contract will now expire at 30 November 2021. The contract was also granted another short extension earlier this year worth $8.2 million.</p>
      <p>The EUTS contract, however, is still expected to expire at 30 June 2020, despite the <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/leidos-lands-another-119m-for-atos-end-user-computing-513768">ATO extending the deal in June 2018</a>.</p>
      <p>The total combined value of both end user computing contracts now sits at $816.7 million over 11 years, of which the ESMC component represents $357.8 million.</p>
      <p>Leidos also said on Thursday that the extension would also see it “optimise and transform the [ATO’s] current ITIL processes and implement an enhanced service integration and management (SIAM) model”.</p>
      <p>The modernisation program, which will be underpinned by a new IT service management platform, is expected to “better support the delivery of services in the ATO’s multi-vendor environment aligned to a ‘service first’ approach”.</p>
      <p>“Leidos Australia is proud of our contribution to the ATO and its customers” said Leidos Australia’s executive officer Christine Zeitz.</p>
      <p>“We are delighted to continue delivering these quality services and supporting the ATO in achieving their strategic objectives.”</p>
      <p>Leidos is one of the ATO's main IT suppliers, alongside DXC for <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/atos-network-services-deal-climbs-to-960m-489571">centralised processing</a> and <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/atos-network-services-deal-climbs-to-960m-489571">Optus for manage network services</a>.</p>
      <p>The three outsourced bundles replaced the agency's frequently troubled monolithic IT outsourcing agreement with EDS in 2009.</p>
      <p>ATO chief information officer Ramez Katf told <i>iTnews</i> last year that the agency would soon begin <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/ato-prepares-massive-it-outsourcing-shake-up-516467">replacing each of the agency’s major IT bundles</a>.</p>
      <p>He said the deals would be re-contested using a phased approach over the next two to three years and would likely become shorter and have a more modular structure.</p>
      <p>A large part of this overhaul is the federal government’s tough new stance on procurement that <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/govt-caps-it-contracts-at-100m-in-tough-new-procurement-stance-471446">caps IT contract at $100 million</a> or three year’s duration.</p>
