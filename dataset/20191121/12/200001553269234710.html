      <p>Jose Mourinho taking over at Tottenham Hotspur rules him out taking over at Real Madrid for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>Whenever there’s problems at the Spanish club, certain voices within the Madrid media pop up and start talking about Mourinho returning to give those pesky players a kick up the behind and sort everything out.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter who the manager in place is, Mourinhoistas will always long for the return of a certain kind of chaos. Of course, there are many in Madrid who would prefer to turn all the Bernabeu lights off, and pretend nobody is at home, should Jose call, and they have their say too.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s edition of <a href="http://marca.com/">Marca</a> reports Zinedine Zidane can now get on with his job without having the ghost of a Portuguese manager following him around.</p>

      <p>The ‘bells of Mou can no longer sound’, and the manager can’t make attempts to flirt with Madrid which could unsettle the club.</p>
      <p>What Marca don’t mention is that Zidane now likely has another managerial ghost following him around, that of Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
