      <h1>Varcoe: Easing Western 'anger' first test for new natural resources minister</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Varcoe, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>A new minister, but the same old problems.</p>
      <p>How will new Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan deal with a furious Alberta government and an ailing oilpatch as Ottawa tries to delicately balance national energy policies with its environmental objectives?</p>
      <p>The last two federal ministers in the portfolio, Jim Carr and Amarjeet Sohi, both hailed from Western Canada and saw first-hand the frustration building within the sector over job losses, contentious legislation such as Bill C-69, and the uncertain fate of new pipelines.</p>
      <p>O’Regan, a former broadcaster who previously served as the minister of Indigenous Services, represents a riding in St. John’s, N.L., another key oil-producing area of the country.</p>
      <p>That should give him an appreciation for the sheer number of jobs — more than 550,000 direct and indirect positions across the country — that rely on the energy sector for a paycheque, and the trepidation of many workers concerned about their future.</p>
      <p>“The people that I represent, my constituents, are oil and gas workers. Some of them work in Alberta,” the natural resources minister told reporters Wednesday after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/newsalert-justin-trudeau-unveils-new-cabinet-focused-on-domestic-challenges/wcm/294b4084-3166-4ff2-bc3a-d6c882ebbcbc">unveiled his new cabinet</a>.</p>
      <p>“Albertans and people in Saskatchewan, people who are involved in the oil and gas industry across the country, need to know that we heard them. We heard them.”</p>

      <p>O’Regan spoke with provincial Energy Minister Sonya Savage on the phone Wednesday and said he’s travelling to Calgary for a face-to-face meeting Thursday.</p>
      <p>But O’Regan will have his hands full in the coming weeks, as the Trudeau government has no MPs in Alberta or Saskatchewan and <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/trudeau-cabinet-targets-western-anger-but-its-only-the-beginning">anger has been building in both provinces</a>, particularly after a divisive election debate surrounding Canada’s climate policies and the oil and gas sector.</p>
      <p>“I would say the relationship is very strained . . . it’s probably a 10 out of 10,” said Andy Mah, CEO of Advantage Oil &amp; Gas.</p>
      <p>“There is anger now, but you can dissipate that anger by listening and acting on what you hear,” added Gary Mar, chief executive of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada.</p>
      <p>The issues facing the oil and gas sector are well documented, from concerns about Canada’s inability to build new pipelines — infrastructure needed to unlock future growth — to worries over how companies will make the transition to a low-carbon future. During the election campaign, the Liberals committed Canada to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>
      <p>Other specific matters must be tackled quickly.</p>
      <p>The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion was re-approved by the federal government earlier this year and is now under construction, but faces more legal challenges in the coming months.</p>
      <p>With Bill C-69 overhauling the environmental assessment process for major projects, does the Trudeau government really want to see any new oil pipelines built that would allow the industry to increase production and emissions?</p>
      <p>The industry will also be watching closely to see if Jonathan Wilkinson, who is taking over the environment and climate change portfolio from Catherine McKenna, charts any new direction in his department.</p>

      <p>The mood in the oilpatch toward the federal government is “very frustrated and, I wouldn’t call it resentment, but anger,” said Whitecap Resources CEO Grant Fagerheim, who has some advice for the new natural resources and environment ministers.</p>
      <p>“They should come out here and park their bodies in Alberta and Saskatchewan for the upcoming time,” he said.</p>
      <p>Getting the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion built is today the most visible and symbolic piece of energy policy that the entire province is watching — and it’s critical investors see the country can get new infrastructure built, said Tim McMillan, head of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.</p>
      <p>The sector will also be looking for the new federal energy and environment ministers to reach equivalency agreements with the province over methane-emissions reduction policies and on Alberta’s new Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) program, which kicks in on Jan. 1.</p>
      <p>Another key issue will centre on how Canada can lure back investment, which has been leaving the oilpatch for other jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>“They need to be champions of this industry, as well as any other industry, not seen as trying to get rid of it,” said Mah.</p>
      <p>Such sentiment is common throughout the oilpatch, and the ball is squarely in O’Regan’s court to answer it.</p>
      <p>“The challenge here is trying to make sure that we have an industry that is thriving, that people realize is stable, that the people who work in it have stable incomes and can look forward to stable futures,” the minister said.</p>
      <p>“It has provided an enormous amount of prosperity to this country. How do we square that with our international commitments and to an overriding concern of Canadians from all parts of the country that we need to do something on climate change?”</p>
      <p>It’s a great question — and it’s one the federal government has to answer.</p>

      <p>Alberta-born Chrystia Freeland will play a key role in the dicey energy-environment nexus as Canada’s new deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs minister. Trudeau also appointed Carr, a Winnipeg MP, to serve as his special representative for the Prairies.</p>
      <p>But it will be the natural resources minister on the hot seat. The provincial government and industry will have plenty of feedback to offer him in the coming days, if he’s prepared to listen and take action.</p>
      <p>“There is anger out there, there is tremendous frustration,” said Tristan Goodman, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada.</p>
      <p>“It just cannot remain as anger and frustration. Nothing is going to get done and that won’t help anyone in the country. We have got to get back to work here.”</p>
