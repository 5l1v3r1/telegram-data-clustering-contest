      <h2>It’s ten years since Puneet Rajkumar’s biggest hit Jackie released, and fans are asking for a sequel</h2>

      <p>Puneet Rajkumar is always looking for exciting young filmmakers to work with irrespective of the language. He would take the trouble of getting the number to call the director if he watched a film he liked. It started at a small house in Basavanagudi, where ‘Arasu’ was being shot. I finished interviewing Meera Jasmine and was chatting with Puneet when he asked me to suggest a good director from other language films. “I’m not satisfied with the stories being narrated,” he said. I told him he should try Suri and see if he has anything interesting before looking elsewhere. “I’ve met him a couple of times but things haven’t worked,” said Puneet, who wanted to work with Suri since he watched ‘Duniya’. I spoke to a reluctant Suri, warning him it’s not easy writing a script for a superstar while retaining his identity as a filmmaker. Suri narrated a ‘one liner’ to Raghavendra Rajkumar who asked a couple of questions and green lit the film more for the confidence he had about Suri’s abilities, than the strength of the script.</p>
      <p>It was decided that the Rajkumar family would produce the film. The cast and crew were finalised. Suri was sure he wanted Bhavana to play the heroine since he’d watched Mysskin’s ‘Chithiram Pesudhadi’. Suri shoots at a brisk pace and does not waste the producer’s money. His scripts have never demanded lavish sets. The ‘talkie’ portion was shot in a few months when the producers decided the foot-tapping songs should be shot abroad. A few places were shortlisted like Innsbruck in Austria, Apulia and Puglia in Italy and the dunes and Dead Vlei Sossusvlie in Namibia. There was no recce. The references were all films like ‘Bachna Ae Hasino’, ‘Ghajini’ and ‘Ayan’. . It was touted as one of the longest and most expensive outdoor schedules for a Kannada film. Once you identify the locales you need a local coordinator who will arrange everything according to your needs. He will be responsible for transport, hospitality and the necessary permissions work out a budget and make arrangements if approved. Most of the money has to be paid upfront.</p>
      <p>The cast and crew for a foreign outdoor are kept to a minimum keeping the cost in mind. We were around 25 when we assembled to board a flight to Dubai en route to Rome. The camera handlers, assistants and the lighting crew have fat passports mostly from trips to places like Bangkok and Patayya. This is a rare opportunity but fact is they are so busy or too tired to take in the sights. Travel in any mode is used to catch up on sleep. At Dubai airport, Puneet spotted Amitabh Bachchan, exchanged niceties and had a keepsake taken. The first time I saw Puneet he was playing on Amitabh’s lap during the shooting of ‘Bhaktha Prahaladha’. The superstar had dropped in from an adjacent set. We bumped into Anurag Kashyap who was taking ‘The Girl In Yellow Boots’ to Venice, exchanged pleasantries and were off. After a few communication problems, when a couple of crew members were isolated and questioned because they did not know where they were heading on landing, Ben our burly local chaperone bundled us into a comfortable bus for a five hour journey from Rome to Lecce.</p>
      <p>There’s no discrimination in travel, hospitality or food. The mode of transport was the same and we all stayed in one hotel. Food for vegetarians is a slight problem, but widely ltraveled members carry large containers of ‘Puliyogare Gojju’ and fried stuff like ‘Kodbale’ and are happy to share. Sathya Hegde carried a bag of heat and eat food ranging from ‘Kesari Bath’ to ‘Pongal’. Rice and curd are universally available. Rooms are already marked on a twin sharing basis and the travel weary contingent hits the bed because not a minute of daylight is to be wasted.</p>

      <p>The next morning we drive to a water body teeming with people on a weekday swimming or getting a tan. Choreographer Harsha scouts for the most picturesque angles. Not a soul disturbs the shooting nor do they gather and gawk. One local lady says, “Indians” and exclaims “Shahrookh Khan”. Since the song is a ‘melody’ there’s no dance involved. Shooting is wrapped up without a hitch, except that someone has stolen Suri’s bag with an expensive camera. The next day we drive to Torre Dell’Orso beach. You enter Hotel Belverdale perched on a cliff, take an elevator and go to a private beach. Except for a few guests the beach is ours. The landscape in Italy is dry, save the water bodies everybody seems to seek. The architecture along the highways is not distinctive and doesn’t deserve a second glance. We shift to the Apulia with rows of Trulli (cone houses), homes built with limestone and a conical roof. The houses look tiny but are surprisingly spacious and comfortable inside. Sathya Hegde is delighted with the curvy roads and the walls bouncing sunlight. One of the advantages of shooting abroad is you don’t have to keep surging crowds at bay or shoo away people straying into the frame. There’s no time to waste, so the unit drives the whole night to Innsbruck in Austria. The transformation in the landscape is remarkable.</p>
      <p>Harsha has to leave for Switzerland to make another pair of stars dance to his tunes while Ben drives us to Frankfurt where we board a flight to Windhoek, Namibia. Since Suriya had shot there for ‘Ayan’, I asked him to recommend a coordinator and he said, “Call Gwen of Namib Film.” We’re driven through endless stretches of sand for hours in a convoy of cars before reaching an isolated hotel built like a castle. There is nothing else in sight for miles. The next morning Gwen wakes up everyone saying, “It’s our time and your money so rise and shine.” We drive to Swapakmond three hours away. Everybody helps carrying some piece of equipment as we trudge the sands uphill. The choreographer from Hyderabad is stuck in Dubai so Suri and Puneet improvise with turns, twists and cartwheels. At lunchtime Paul who works with Gwen tells everyone not to throw paper or plastic. Paul who worked for the Hindi version of ‘Ghajini’ said: “That Aamir guy was nice but would insist on hot ‘omelets’ when the nearest stove was kilometers away.” An unforgettable image is Paul chasing a piece of plastic blown by the swirling wind discarded by a unit hand.</p>
      <p>Whatever the landscape or weather, Puneet would be up early to jog and exercise. He was friendly with the locals and unitBhavana is the most non fussy actress I’ve seen. A foreign outdoor schedule may appear glamorous but it’s all work. There are no off days because the costs escalate. The tired crew dozes off on the long layoff back at Dubai. Puneet hands over a generous amount of Euros to each one of them to shop. His only advice is: “Don’t buy liquor.”</p>
      <p>It’s going to be ten years since ‘Jackie’ was released and turned out to be a blockbuster. It was not a great film, but connected with Puneet’s fans who still ask for a sequel. Some things just happen, by design or you can call it destiny.</p>
