      <h1>The World Is Your Oyster With New Google Earth Creation Tools</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:32:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Over my 33 years, I’ve lived in nine different cities in six different states/regions on two different continents.</p>
      <p>Each home comes with its own sights, sounds, smells, and tastes—anecdotes that can’t be contained to a growing photo album.</p>
      <p>Now, with the help of new creation tools in <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/explore-our-changing-planet-on-the-go-with-google-earth-timelapse-1784662/">Google Earth</a>, I can rekindle those memories.</p>
      <p>“For nearly 15 years, people have turned to Google Earth for a comprehensive view of our planet,” <a href="https://blog.google/products/earth/new-google-earth-creation-tools">according to</a> product manager Gopal Shah. “But our mission has never been to just show you a static picture of the planet; we want to bring the whole world to life.”</p>

      <p>Once you’re finished, share it with the world: Click the “Present” button to take your audience on a tour of <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yzOf5vYcx2VYzMhcyCq1bIEnXHm8wUnm&amp;usp=sharing">a river under threat</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1byPfOma_mIJJCGuT3Gt8tnYB4XvwArIH&amp;usp=sharing">a slave’s journey from oppression to freedom</a>, or <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=17LuW1mwmgvFhY6TYxbG_GghAu-knEwrb&amp;usp=sharing">a fictional road trip</a>.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, Google introduced Voyager, a showcase of guided tours to “infuse the globe with stories.”</p>

      <p>With this week’s launch, the company takes the next “and most significant” step forward by “turning the power of mapmaking and storytelling over to you,” Shah wrote in a blog post.</p>
      <p>New creation tools are available in <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/">Google Earth on the web</a>. There is no word on whether they will roll out to mobile devices, which currently only support the viewing of projects.</p>
      <p>“You can turn our digital globe into your own storytelling canvas, and create a map or story about the places that matter to you,” Shah said.</p>
