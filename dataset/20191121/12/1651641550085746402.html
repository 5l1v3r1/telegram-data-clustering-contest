        <b>After the launch of Google Stadia two days ago, gamers are reporting that Google Stadia overheating and killing their Chromecast Ultras. </b>
      </p>
      <p>With the service’s <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/everything-revealed-google-stadia-combines-subscription-and-purchases-into-one-chromecast-needed-on-launch/">Founders Edition</a> and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/sold-out-google-stadia-founders-editions-are-all-pre-ordered/">Premiere Edition</a> packages coming bundled with Chromecast Ultra devices,  many are attempting to enjoy the service on their TV sets. Unfortunately, Stadia’s intensive streaming is causing issues.</p>
      <p>“I was in the middle of a fight in Destiny 2 when suddenly my Chromecast died and lost connectivity to the network,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dzd6v8/chromecast_ultra_overheating/">one user posted on the Stadia subreddit</a>. “I went to unplug it from the power and it was <i>extremely</i> hot.”</p>
      <p>The redditor stated that they had only been playing “about 3-4 hours into my session at that point” before the death of their device.</p>
      <p>Other users are reporting similar issues with Google Stadia overheating and killing their Chromecast Ultra during standard gameplay.</p>
      <p>“Mine has overheated and shut off twice now,” one user said. “I thought once I got my code and package I could stop worrying,” said another. “Now the f***ing” Chromecast is actually overheating??? I’m installing a raspberry pi heatsink and moving on I guess.”</p>
      <p>As far as Chromecast Ultra heat dissipation goes, the system has always suffered from poor cooling. However, while the device’s<i> usually</i> run rather hot, actual overheating and temperature related shut down is not a typical issue.</p>
      <p>With the service advertising a “no hassles” plug-and-play service, Chromecast Ultras overheating and dying is a huge issue for Google.</p>
