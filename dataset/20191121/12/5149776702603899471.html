      <p>A business owner has criticised a Nottingham <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">university</a>'s decision to scrap its decorative arts course, which gave her the skills to set up her own creative business in the city.</p>
      <p>Chloe Rose, 25, graduated with a decorative arts degree at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-trent-university">Nottingham Trent University</a> (NTU) in 2016 and has gone on to set up her own ceramic-making business and work as an art psychotherapist with sexually abused children.</p>
      <p>The ceramicist from Gedling said the course allowed students to develop skills and techniques with materials such as wood, clay, glass and textiles.</p>
      <p>Her time on the course helped her see how art could be used therapeutically and developed her clay-making skills.</p>
      <p>But scrapping the course has left her "sad" and worried about future creative jobs.</p>
      <p>NTU has said the decision was made due to falling numbers in those applying to study decorative arts.</p>

        <figcaption>Chloe is "angry" the course at NTU has been scrapped.</figcaption>

      <p>Chloe said: "I think quite a lot will be missed out through this course being scrapped because the same skills aren't learnt in other more contemporary art courses. I feel really sad for the next generation of makers who will no longer have the enriching opportunities we did.</p>
      <p>"For the past year I have been working within childhood sexual abuse. I have often used clay in sessions which is a skill I learnt on the course – a skill others now may not be able to learn.</p>
      <p>"Using clay within art therapy is a powerful tool which has been found to connect thoughts to feelings. Many young people have found clay a useful tool to manage and process their thoughts and feelings."</p>
      <p>Chloe, who had around 46 course mates studying with her, said that through the course the university encouraged students to engage with volunteer work in the city.</p>
      <p>She added: "I ran a project for bereaved children with complex needs for the three years I was on the course through a charity. I know other decorative arts students have run similar projects or volunteered in other ways this was a way that many students contributed so it’s a real loss.</p>
      <p>"The contribution to the economy from the arts is so much bigger than people might imagine. Even for example walking into a shop like IKEA, it's courses like decorative arts that lead into those roles."</p>

      <p>Another former decorative arts student, Becky Dick, who lives in Gloucestershire, added: "I ended up doing a taxidermy placement whilst I was studying in my second year. Even as something as niche as taxidermy I was able to still get the guidance and encouragement I needed."</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old, who now works as a taxidermist, added: "Without this course I couldn't have done any of that and I’m truly saddened and devastated the course couldn't be saved.</p>
      <p>"By the end of the course in 2015 I began trading as Taxtiles - a merge of the two words textile &amp; taxidermy."</p>

      <p>Annie McGraw, 22, graduated from the course at NTU last year and works as a barista and receptionist in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'm so gutted. Decorative arts was such a humble and one-off course and there aren’t many like it left in the UK.</p>
      <p>"The impact of it being scrapped will be very negative for any future artists who have a variety of skills and want to explore and find themselves."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for NTU said: “Demand for places on decorative arts degrees is falling and we have experienced a reduction in applications at NTU.</p>

      <p>“Applications for our undergraduate degree in decorative arts will now cease. All students currently on BA Decorative Arts at NTU will be able to complete their degree as normal.</p>
      <p>“No job losses are planned as existing staff are expected to provide the enhanced making and crafts provision in other subject areas, including fine art and product and furniture design."</p>
