      <p>With "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown" in the rear view, it's time to get ready for the next classic Peanuts holiday episode, "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving."</p>
      <p>In this beloved holiday special, Charlie Brown finds himself in a bit of a bind when Peppermint Patty invites herself and a few friends over for Thanksgiving dinner. With Snoopy and Woodstock pulling kitchen duty, a traditional turkey and stuffing meal is simply not in the cards. Will good old Charlie Brown survive the holiday and the wrath of his hungry dinner guests?</p>
