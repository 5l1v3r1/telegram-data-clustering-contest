      <p>“Looking at the factors the court didn’t want to give him a non-custodian sentence but rather send a signal out there to deter others. So, he was given a fine of 200 penalty unites for the second charge which is the resisting arrest and for the first charge to sign a bond of good behaviour and in default three months in prison”.</p>
      <p>He further said, Awal’s remorse after the incident and pleas from the Black Stars players and coach also factored in the verdict.</p>
