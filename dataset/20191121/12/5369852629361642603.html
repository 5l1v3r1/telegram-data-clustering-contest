      <h1>'Disrespectful, ungrateful' – Bale slammed by Spanish press over 'Wales, golf, Madrid' banner</h1>
      <h2>The player’s perception in Madrid has now fallen to all-time low.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:47:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author">The42 Team</a></address>
      <p>GARETH BALE’S POPULARITY in Spain appears to have sunk to an all-time low as he heads back to Real Madrid following international duty.</p>
      <p>Not sighted in La Liga for well over a month, the winger made his second Wales start in four days as Ryan Giggs’ men secured Euro 2020 qualification with a 2-0 win over Hungary on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Bale’s timely return to fitness prompted suspicion in the Madrid press, and his actions after the game have attracted more scorn from a media that has routinely criticised him for spending too much time on the golf course.</p>
      <p>In Cardiff, he was pictured celebrating with Wales team-mates behind a banner that read: “WALES. GOLF. MADRID… IN THAT ORDER”.</p>
      <p>The banner is a reference to comments made by former Real Madrid player Pedja Mijatovic, who criticised Bale’s supposed priorities in his professional life. </p>
      <p>Madrid newspaper Marca, said to have close links to the Real, did not take kindly to what has been perceived as a mocking gesture.</p>
      <p>The front page of its Thursday edition featured Bale and the headline: “DISRESPECTFUL. WRONG. UNGRATEFUL. IN THAT ORDER”.</p>

      <p>AS, also headquartered in the Spanish capital, depicted the four-time Champions League winner sinking a close-range putt alongside the headline: “BALE IS IN A HOLE”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, online newspaper El Espanol captured the order of priorities supporters expect – “MADRID. MADRID. MADRID. IN THAT ORDER” – while columnist Tomas Roncero summed up what appears to lay ahead.</p>

      <p>His comment piece in AS included a simple, ominous quote for Bale’s future: “Out, out, out.”</p>

      <p>In an interview with The Athletic, ex-Madrid president Ramon Calderon called Bale “childish” and claimed fans were “very angry” with the one-time €100 million signing.</p>
