      <p>With a winter storm warning cancelled for the mountains around Las Vegas, residents will encounter cool temperatures for a few days.</p>
      <p>The Las Vegas Valley could receive some rain before 2 p.m. Thursday. Skies will be party cloudy and the high will be near 52 with light easterly winds becoming calm late in the morning, according to the National Weather Service forecast.</p>
      <p>Thursday night lows will be near 46 with light winds and partly cloudy skies.</p>
      <p>Friday’s high will rise to 60 with light northeast winds and sunny skies.</p>
      <p>The weekend calls for sunny skies and highs in the low 60s, which is the norm for late November.</p>
      <p>Early Thursday the weather service cancelled the winter storm warning for the Sheep Range, Spring Mountains and Red Rock Canyon that was to have been effective until 4 p.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>“There may be some more flurries, but it won’t amount to much,” said meteorologist Alex Boothe.</p>
