      <p>Every millennial who loves YouTube knows Bhuvan Bam, an internet sensation who started his journey as a restaurant singer. But Bhuvan is beyond comedy and is known for his sartorial choices as well. It won’t be an understatement to call him the country’s most fashionable comedian. With a lethal sense of humour and a charming smile, here’s Bhuvan Bam unplugged, telling <i>theindianexpress.com</i> what he loves about fashion.</p>
      <p>Excerpts from the interview.</p>
      <p>
        <b>From plain and sauve suits to bright colours, how do you manage to strike a balance between the two?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I frankly don’t know which outfit to wear on a particular occasion. I wear what makes me happy and comfortable. There have been times when I have attended a wedding in a hoodie just because I looked fine that day! But, of course, there are days when I want to dress up for the occasion. I love wearing suits too, so that’s how I strike the balance between the two. Some days, I’m a hoodie guy and on others, I sport suits.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you like to follow fashion trends or do you enjoy it more when it defines who you are?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The only trend I followed growing up was my father’s dressing sense. A checkered shirt and jeans/pyjama is what does the job for me. My personal style is mostly casual yet polished. I love wearing solid colours and hoodies. In my opinion, clothes never define someone, it depends on who’s wearing what and how they carry it. Also, fashion means different things to different people and there are multiple examples of that, like Ranveer (Singh) and Deepika (Padukone), they’re both stylish but have contrasting fashion choices.  I like clothes that mirror who I am and how I feel. I’m not someone who will wear something just because it’s trendy and everyone’s sporting it</p>

        <b>Five must-have pieces in the wardrobe for everybody?</b>
      </p>
      <p>For me, basics are everything; I’m not someone who’s fancy. I love my basic white shirt with jeans and shoes. Thus, five must-have pieces in anyone’s wardrobe should be a pair of jeans, a denim jacket, solid colour t-shirts, a pyjama and perfume.</p>
      <p><b>You really enjoy layering your graphic tees. Any tips to keep in mind?</b><br/>I certainly do! Layering with t-shirts is pretty basic; one can throw on a bomber jacket or wear a shirt beneath the T-shirt. You could also put together a semi-formal outfit by wearing a blazer over the graphic t-shirt.</p>
      <p><b>Styling long hair is not an easy task, how can one do it? You are also known for playing with hats and caps, how can one team it with their outfits?</b><br/>My hair is naturally straight. For occasions that hold importance, I try different hairstyles for which I’m lucky to have people help style my annoyingly silky straight hair. It’s super easy to play around with hats, it’s not rocket science at all. You can wear a cap with anything casual, like t-shirts, hoodies, fun jackets. There are also hats you can style with formal outfits that look classy and dapper.</p>
