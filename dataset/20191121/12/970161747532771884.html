      <p>Jessie J has been spotted wrapping up warm for the winter as her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/channing-tatum-jenna-dewans-divorce-finalised-almost-two-years-split-11192741/">boyfriend Channing Tatum’s divorce from Jenna Dewan is finalised.</a></p>
      <p>The Price Tag singer, who has been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> the actor since October, was seen smiling away as she attended the press night for the &amp; Juliet musical.</p>
      <p>Battling the freezing London temperatures (we feel you, girl), she looked stunning in a huge black coat and navy suit, rocking her hair up in a bun.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old looked in high spirits as she snapped photos with fans, before being escorted by security.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Channing and Jenna’s divorce has been finalised almost two years after their split.</p>

      <p>The former couple, who married in 2009 three years after meeting on the set of Step Up, announced their split in April 2018.</p>
      <p>It’s now reported that a judge has granted their request to legally separate while they discuss custody agreements and a property settlement.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Channing and Jenna filed papers asking for the divorce so that they have the option to settle down with their new partners.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/20/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-legally-single-divorce/">According to TMZ</a>, documents filed by Jenna’s lawyer Samantha Spector indicate the divorce judgement was announced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Although Jessie and Channing kept the romance lowkey at first, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/well-arent-jessie-j-channing-tatum-just-two-adorable-kids-love-10967167/">they’ve since been enjoying a number of adorable dates</a>, cosying up to each other in Santa Monica, California.</p>

      <p>Oh, you guys.</p>
      <p>However, Jenna previously<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/17/jenna-dewan-initially-blindsided-channing-tatums-relationship-jessie-j-10938977/"> admitted she was ‘blindsided’ by her ex’s new relationship.</a></p>
      <p>According<a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/10/jenna-dewan-blindsided-channing-tatum-jessie-j-romance-new-memoir-book/"> to Radar Online</a>, the 38-year-old wrote in her new memoir: ‘There I was, on a plane, alone, finding out about his new relationship. I felt blindsided.’</p>

      <p>The mother-of-one later revealed how she was going to react to the news via Twitter, but decided not to share her string of messages.</p>
      <p>‘Instead of reacting the way I wanted… I asked myself this: How do I choose grace in this moment?’ she explained.</p>
      <p>Yet, there is no bad blood between both Jessie and Jenna, as the Step Up star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/17/jenna-dewan-says-she-has-nothing-but-respect-for-jessie-j-and-its-too-sweet-8149928/">threw her support behind the singer when fans compared the two women</a>, pitting them against each other.</p>

      <p>And Jenna<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/pregnant-jenna-dewan-glowing-cradles-baby-bump-takes-santa-monica-11188072/"> was recently seen glowing as she stepped out for a photo shoot</a>, with the star expecting a baby with her boyfriend Steve Kazee.</p>
      <p>It’s happy endings all round.</p>
