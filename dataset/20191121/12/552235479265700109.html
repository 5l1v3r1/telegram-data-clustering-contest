      <p>A man who chanted sickening sectarian song lyrics at Kilmarnock’s Rugby Park has been fined.</p>
      <p>Mark Ashe chanted Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) lyrics while waiting to enter the stadium with a group of supporters.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on February 9 prior to an evening Scottish Cup Fifth Round match in which Kilmarnock and Rangers drew 0-0.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old appeared before Kilmarnock Sheriff Court this week where he denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>However, Ashe was found guilty of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner by chanting the lyrics of the terrorist organisation by Sheriff Shirley Foran.</p>
      <p>Ashe, of Tippet Knowes Park, Winchburgh, West Lothian was fined £750 but was not issued a football banning order.</p>
