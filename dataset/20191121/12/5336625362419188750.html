      <p>The Democrats have wrapped up their fifth 2020 presidential candidate debate at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, and Trevor Noah jumped in straight afterwards to highlight the most awkward bits.</p>
      <p>But especially Joe Biden's... uh... bad, bad, <i>bad </i>word choice when discussing legislation aiming to end violence against women.</p>
      <p>"No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger, other than in self-defense and that's rarely ever occurred. And so we have to just change the culture. Period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it," Biden said. </p>
      <p>"What are you doing? What are you doing, Joe?" said an almost speechless Noah. </p>
      <p>"The only way he can recover from that is if he just starts making bad word choices his 'thing'. You know? He just needs to dig deeper, just be like, 'We need to get right to the heart of the drug epidemic, I'm saying get deep in the veins of the drug problem and when we do it it's gonna feel so good.'"</p>
