      <p>Surrey RCMP say three visiting residents have been deported from Canada, and three others are undergoing a status review related to a violent incident in Surrey that was caught on video and shared widely online.</p>
      <p>The fight in the Strawberry Hills neighbourhood in August was followed by a similar violent incident on Nov. 11 that was described by Mayor Doug McCallum as “mob violence.”</p>
      <p>The two incidents have highlighted a growing number of safety concerns and complaints expressed by local residents regarding groups of youth and young adults in the area. Many, but not all, are on visiting, work or student visas and are engaging in harassment, mischief, public drinking and assaults, according to police.</p>
      <p>Cpl. Elenore Sturko said she had no details as to the grounds for which the three individuals were deported. </p>
      <p>Sturko alluded to criminal activity being a factor in the deportation, although she did not confirm any charges had been laid. She said police have stepped up enforcement in the area since March, and when a suspect is identified as a visa holder, police refer the incident to Canadian Border Services.</p>
      <p>“While not all of these incidents involve international students, law enforcement officials want to remind individuals who are visiting Canada on a visa that any engagement in criminal activity violates the condition of their visa and they could be removed from Canada as a result."</p>
      <p>A total of 50 people connected to the groups have been investigated.</p>
