      <h1>How Juventus could line up against Atalanta</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> will be looking to continue their unbeaten start to the 2019-20 Serie A campaign when they travel to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/atalanta-bc/"><b>Atalanta BC</b></a> on Saturday afternoon.</h2>

      <p>A total of 32 points from 12 matches has left the Old Lady top of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/serie-a/table.html">the table</a>, just one point clear of second-placed Inter Milan heading into the next set of fixtures.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/maurizio-sarri/"><b>Maurizio Sarri</b></a>'s side recorded a 1-0 win over AC Milan before the international break but face a tough examination this weekend against an Atalanta side that are fifth in the division.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how the Serie A leaders could line up on the afternoon.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/giorgio-chiellini/"><b>Giorgio Chiellini</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mattia-perin/"><b>Mattia Perin</b></a> (shoulder)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-sandro/"><b>Alex Sandro</b></a> (groin), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/miralem-pjanic/"><b>Miralem Pjanic</b></a> (groin), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adrien-rabiot/"><b>Adrien Rabiot</b></a> (thigh), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/blaise-matuidi/"><b>Blaise Matuidi</b></a> (rib)</p>
      <p>Juve will once again be without the services of Giorgio Chiellini and Mattia Perin as the pair battle to overcome knee and shoulder injuries respectively.</p>
      <p>There are also doubts over Alex Sandro, Miralem Pjanic, Adrien Rabiot and Blaise Matuidi ahead of Saturday's affair.</p>
      <p>Sandro is said to be making progress on the groin issue that he picked up over the international break, although it remains to be seen whether the Brazilian is risked from the start.</p>
      <p>Pjanic, meanwhile, has only trained partially this week as the midfielder looks to overcome a groin issue, and Rabiot is struggling to recover from a thigh injury before this fixture rolls around.</p>
      <p>Matuidi, however, is being tipped to overcome a rib injury to start for the champions.</p>
      <p>There are not expected to be many surprises in the XI, with perhaps the main talking point surrounding whether <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gonzalo-higuain/"><b>Gonzalo Higuain</b></a> or <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paulo-dybala/"><b>Paulo Dybala</b></a> start alongside <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cristiano-ronaldo/"><b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b></a> in the final third.</p>
      <p>Higuain is just being tipped to get the nod, and head coach Sarri will be hoping that Ronaldo can complete the match with the Portugal international just struggling to shake off a niggling knee complaint in recent weeks.</p>
