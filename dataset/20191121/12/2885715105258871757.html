      <p>Presence of more companies in the market will lead to more innovation, quality and R&amp;D activities, said domestic steel players on Thursday while reacting to the entry of global steel giant ArcelorMittal in India.</p>
      <p>“We don’t see ArcelorMittal as a challenge,” JSW Steel Chairman Sajjan Jindal told PTI on the sidelines of the ISA Steel Conclave here.</p>
      <p>More the number of players, more the research &amp; development (R&amp;D) activities, innovations, quality in the market, he added reacting to a question how will the ArcelorMittal’s entry benefit the consumers.</p>
      <p>Jindal Steel and Power Chairman Naveen Jindal said, “We see its (ArcelorMittal’s) entry as a positive step.”</p>
      <p>Tata Steel Chief Financial Officer Koushik Chatterjee also said there should be competition in the market.</p>
      <p>Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) Chairman A K Chaudhary said, “ArcelorMittal’s entry will promote healthy competition in market.”</p>
      <p>The industry looks forward to work with them in future, he added.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Supreme Court paved the way for ArcelorMittal’s takeover of debt-ridden Essar Steel for Rs 42,000 crore and set aside the July 4 NCLAT order giving equal status to financial creditors and operational creditors.</p>
      <p>Following the verdict, ArcelorMittal said it expects to complete the acquisition of the debt-ridden company by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Essar Steel was auctioned under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to recover Rs 54,547 crore of unpaid dues of financial lenders and operational creditors.</p>
