      <p>Lib Dem leader <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jo-swinson/">Jo Swinson</a> has said she ‘enjoyed’ smoking cannabis at university as she pledged to make it legal if her party wins the election.</p>
      <p>Miss Swinson last night told Newsnight: ‘I’m not going to be one of those people who says “I tried it once and I didn’t really inhale”.</p>
      <p>‘Yes, I enjoyed it. And it wasn’t unusual… lots of people do it and we should enable them to do it more safely.’</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats confirmed they will create a regulated market for the class B drug as they <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/lib-dems-launch-stop-brexit-manifesto-setting-party-remain-11189629/">unveiled their manifesto</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The party slammed Labour and the Tories’ ‘prohibitionist attitude to drug use’ saying a cannabis tax could raise £1.5 billion to fight crime.</p>
      <p>The pro-Remain group said they would follow models from the US and Canada by<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/lib-dems-say-legalising-cannabis-raise-1500000000-tax-11191938/"> legalising the sale of cannabis</a> through licensed shops.</p>

      <p>It would only be legal for adults over 18, with limits placed on how strong the weed could be, the party said.</p>

      <p>After her manifesto launch, Ms Swinson said: ‘We’re criminalising far too many young people. It’s also meaning that it becomes a gateway to other crime.</p>
      <p>‘If instead we can regulate the cannabis market, we can raise taxation revenue from that, we can set regulations about the safety of the cannabis which is bought and sold.</p>
      <p>‘Then we can create a much safer environment. This is something that is led by the evidence.</p>
      <p>‘It’s happened in other countries where they’ve seen a decrease in crime rate and indeed they’ve been able to make sure people’s health has been protected too.’</p>
      <p>Under the plans, the Department of Health would lead on drugs policy rather than the Home Office.</p>
