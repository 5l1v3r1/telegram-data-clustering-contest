      <p>Maserati has showcased a new development sports car being tested out on the public roads in heavy disguise.</p>
      <p>The Italian firm has showcased the new car in a series of images which show the undercover car leaving its Modena test factory under the cover of darkness.</p>

      <p>The car appears to be a compact mid-engine vehicle which seems to be based on Alfa Romeo’s recently-dropped 4C – suggesting that this prototype could be being used solely for powertrain development.</p>
      <p>Maserati says that the model is using a ‘new powertrain entirely developed and built for Maserati’.</p>

      <p>It has yet to publish any further details about the car, though the vehicle’s camouflage print suggest that it will be unveiled at an event in May 2020.</p>
      <p>It’s set to be the first all-new Maserati introduced since 2015, and the new powertrain is expected to feature some kind of hybrid assistance after Maserati released a business plan which announced that it was upgrading its Modena production line to be able to produce this new model’s electric powertrain.</p>
