      <p>It seems the boycotts, death threats, and complaints about Dexit didn’t work, as Pokémon Sword and Shield break Nintendo records.</p>
      <p>The first mainline Pokémon game on a non-portable-only console has become the Nintendo Switch’s biggest game so far, with Pokémon Sword and Shield selling over 6 million copies worldwide in just a week.</p>
      <p>That figure includes both digital and physical sales and is twice what <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/13/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-review-nintendo-used-nostalgia-its-super-effective-8134907/">Pokémon: Let’s Go</a> sold at the same time last year.</p>
      <p>It’s also 1 million more than previous record holder Super Smash Bros. Ultimate from last Christmas.</p>
      <p>The disparity with Pokémon: Let’s Go is interesting though, because while it wasn’t a mainline entry it was a remake of one and apart from the method of catching pokémon, not really all that different from Pokémon Sword and Shield.</p>

      <p>Pokémon Sword and Shield is currently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/pokemon-sword-shield-best-selling-exclusive-year-uk-sales-charts-11174083/">number one in the UK</a>, where it’s already become the fastest-selling exclusive of the year and the third fastest of any game – behind only the FIFA and Call Of Duty.</p>
      <p>It’s also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/pokemon-sword-not-shield-new-uk-number-one-games-charts-16-november-11177697/">number one in Japan</a> – where it’s sold 2 million copies, a third of which were digital – and is also almost certainly number one in the US at the moment, but those charts only get released monthly.</p>
      <p>It is not, however, the fastest-selling Pokémon game ever, but has had to take second place to Pokémon Sun and Moon on the 3DS, which sold 7.2 million copies in its first week.</p>
      <p>But then the 3DS is a cheaper console and Sun and Moon came out right as the initial Pokémon GO craze was at its peak.</p>
