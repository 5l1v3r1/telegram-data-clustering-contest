      <h1>UPDATED: Alleged P&amp;ID Scam: EFCC files fresh charges against Briton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:55:15+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/364393-alleged-pid-scam-efcc-files-fresh-charges-against-briton.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Thursday re-arraigned a British national, James Nolan.</p>
      <p>Mr Nolan was re-arraigned on a 32-count amended charge for his involvement in the controversial contract awarded to Process and Industrial Development Limited (P&amp;ID).</p>
      <p>He and another accused person, Adam Quinn (who is still at large), were on October 21 docked on a 16 count-charge of money laundering.</p>
      <p>They were arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on October 21 and Mr Nolan pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>The defendants are both directors of Goidel Resources Limited, a Designated Non-Financial Institution (DNFI), and ICIL Limited; firms that they allegedly used for money laundering. Mr Nolan is also said to be a signatory to P&amp;ID accounts.</p>
      <p>But at the resumed hearing of the matter on Thursday, EFCC’s lawyer, Ekele Iheanacho, informed the Federal High Court in Abuja of an amended charge he filed on November 20.</p>
      <p>Mr Iheancho said the EFCC is now bringing up the 32-count charge against the defendants in the case contrary to the initial 16-count charge.</p>
      <h4>EFCC’s witness testifies</h4>
      <p>After Mr Nolan pleaded not guilty to the 32-count charge read to him and a plea of not guilty entered for the first defendant who is not a person, the court continued the trial with the EFCC’s first witness, Adewale Akinseye, who said he was an account officer with Guaranteed Trust Bank(GTB).</p>
      <p>Mr Akinseye confirmed to the court that he was the account officer of P&amp;ID Limited.</p>
      <p>He said he also recalled that in his statement to the anti-graft agency, he identified Jadesola Awoyinfa and Adamu Usman as the promoters of P&amp;ID as deduced from the particulars of directors and account opening documents.</p>
      <p>Mr Akinseye said the account was initiated on August 10, 2006.</p>
      <p>“From the details of (the) transaction provided for activities on the account, we have a dollar inflow of $76,170 (which) was inflowed from the account of P&amp;ID Limited, c/o K. Treppides Company Limited to P&amp;ID Nigeria Limited on September 5, 2006,” the witness read from his statement. “(And another) $135,000 on September 5, 2006, from P&amp;ID Limited, c/o K. Treppides Company Limited to P&amp;ID Nigeria Limited.”</p>
      <p>According to Mr Akinseye, the bank checks and identifies the source of funds sent to it and if the funds had emanated from a sanctioned party, the bank would not have accepted the funds.</p>
      <p>The court presided over by Okon Abang adjourned the matter to December 6 for ruling on the admissibility of the statement made by the EFCC witness.</p>
      <p>Backstory</p>
      <p>P&amp;ID had approached a British court to seek compensation claiming the Nigeria government breached a 2010 gas contract agreement. The government had contracted P&amp;ID to build gas processing facilities around Calabar, Cross River. According to the contract, the government was required to supply wet gas of up to 400 million cubic feet daily.</p>
      <p>The court initially granted the firm an arbitral award of $6.6 billion. But the figure rose to about $9 billion with an additional $2.3 billion in accumulated interest at 7 per cent rate, after Nigeria refused to enter an appeal for more than five years after the original ruling.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian government has appealed the British court ruling and secured an order delaying the execution of the court judgment.</p>
      <p>The government says the contract was fraudulent ab initio and that both parties (including the Nigerian officials who signed for Nigeria) signed it to defraud the Nigerian government.</p>
      <p>The contract was signed by Nigeria’s former petroleum minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke, who has various corruption cases against her. She is currently in London where she is being investigated for money laundering. A former petroleum ministry official who signed the contract as a witness is also being prosecuted.</p>
