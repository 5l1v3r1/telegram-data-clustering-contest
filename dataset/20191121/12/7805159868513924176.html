      <h1>Google now pays up to $1.5 million for Titan M security vulnerabilities on the Pixel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/joefedewa/" target="_blank">Joe Fedewa</a></address>
      <p>Google created the Android Security Reward program <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-launches-android-security-rewards-program/">back in 2015</a> to reward people who find and report Android security issues. Over the years, this program has helped fix thousands of issues, and Google has paid out over $4 million to researchers. Today, the company has announced an expansion of the program and new reward amounts to include Titan M security vulnerabilities on the Pixel.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-pixel-3/">Pixel 3</a>, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-pixel-3/">Pixel 3 XL</a>, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pixel-3a-almost-everything-you-need-video/">Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL</a>, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-series-hub-page/">Pixel 4, and Pixel 4 XL</a> are some of the most secure Android phones on the market. Not only do they get consistent monthly updates, but they also include <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-3-titan-m-security/">the Titan M security chip</a>. Google is now introducing a top prize of $1 million in the Android Security Reward program for a “full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence which compromises the Titan M secure element on Pixel devices.”</p>
      <p>That’s not all either. Google will also be launching a program that offers a 50% bonus for exploits found in Android Developer Previews. This means the top prize, theoretically, could be $1.5 million. Google says it added a dedicated prize for the Titan M because the Pixel series has been rated so highly in terms of the built-in security.</p>
      <p>On top of the Pixel Titan M payouts, Google is also introducing some other categories of exploits. These new categories include data exfiltration, lock screen bypass, and more, with rewards going up to $500,000. You can read the full details on the Android Security Reward <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">program rules page</a>.</p>
      <p>Google shared some year-end stats from the Android Security Reward program as well:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total payouts in the last 12 months have been over $1.5 million.</li>
        <li>Over 100 participating researchers have received an average reward amount of over $3,800 per finding (46%<br/>increase from last year). On average, Google paid out over $15,000 (20% increase from last year) per<br/>researcher.</li>
        <li>The top reward paid out in 2019 was $161,337 to Guang Gong of Alpha Lab, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd for the first reported 1-click remote code execution exploit<br/>chain on the Pixel 3.</li>
      </ul>
