      <p>India and the United States are in talks to resolve trade issues and both New Delhi and Washington hope to find an early solution, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said on November 21.</p>
      <p>“Discussions have been going on between the two sides,” Mr. Kumar said in a news conference.</p>
      <p>“We remain optimistic that a solution will be found very soon,” he added.</p>
      <p>The two countries have been locked in trade disputes for months, slapping higher tariffs on each other’s products and the U.S. withdrawing a key concession to India.</p>
