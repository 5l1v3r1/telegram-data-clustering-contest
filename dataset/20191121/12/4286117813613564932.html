      <p>Opposing the Centre’s decision to hive off or disinvest shares in several PSUs, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday contended that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should talk to experts and all political parties to tide over the economic crisis. Mamata Banerjee asserted that selling off government stake in central public sector firms can only provide temporary respite.</p>
      <p>"Disinvesting public sectors units may seem like the only solution to solve the present crisis, but unless there is economic stability such actions won’t help. The economic disaster will further deteriorate. I think PM should consult economic experts of our country," Mamata Banerjee said.</p>

      <p>"Everyone’s opinion should be taken. Who knows, something positive may emerge out of it," she said.</p>
      <p>In the biggest privatisation drive ever, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved sale of government’s stake in blue-chip oil firm BPCL, shipping firm Shipping Corporation of India and cargo mover Concor, and decided to cut shareholding in select public sector firms below 51 per cent to boost revenue collections that have been hit by the slowing economy.</p>
