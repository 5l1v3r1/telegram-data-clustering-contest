      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“With the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> minutes out of the way, the market will continue to look toward trade headlines for direction. The ongoing uncertainty about whether a Phase 1 deal can be finished suggests that <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/volatility">volatility</a> should remain elevated. This can also keep markets pricing in more 2020 rate cuts as the higher probability of trade tensions can keep economic fundamentals under pressure.”<br/> <br/>“The Philly <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed">Fed</a> manufacturing survey will give us a new indication about the performance of the sector in November, with the consensus looking for a modest increase to 6.0 from 5.6 in October. Separately, existing home sales are expected to increase 2.0% m/m in October following a -2.2% decline in the prior month. Sales have picked-up recently under an environment of low mortgage rates, which has also helped to support the rest of the housing sector.”</p>
