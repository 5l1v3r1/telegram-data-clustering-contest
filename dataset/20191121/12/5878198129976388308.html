      <h1>Four charismatic civil rights activists who were killed by one of their own</h1>

      <p>The story of diasporic black people is usually that of fighting an order that would not be convinced that our kind deserve equal opportunity and dignity.</p>
      <p>The opposition to civil rights mainly comes from those who feel their privilege threatened by another asking for equality.</p>
      <p>However, some harm has been caused to certain charismatic civil rights fighters by those close to them. Those who cause this harm are black people too and are usually friends or former friends.</p>
      <p>It is perhaps clichéd but no less true that anyone might do well to keep their friends close and enemies closer. In the same vein, an African proverb notes that the insect that is likely to bite you is hiding in your cloth.</p>
      <p>This is a list of promising lives in the civil rights struggles that were cut off by kinfolk.</p>
