      <p>Google's Android <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/bug-bounty">bug bounty</a> program has come a long way since its humble roots back in mid-2015. At the time, the search and software giant offered a maximum payout of $38,000 for specific exploits that compromised the world's most popular operating system. Today, Google has announced that its maximum payout now weighs in at up to a staggering $1.5 million if certain exploit conditions are met.</p>
      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/google">Google</a> previously offered payouts that maxed out at $200,000, but the new "baseline" top prize is $1 million. The $1.5 million maximum payout is achieved with a $500,000 bonus that will likely be incredibly tough to pull off.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the bug bounty is to help beef up the security of both its first-party Pixel hardware and the Android operating system as a whole. Android in particular has been a common target for hackers -- we recently covered an exploit that l<a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-camera-app-vulnerability">everages the Google Camera app</a> -- so it should come as no surprise that Google wasn't to make sure that its hardware and software is as secure as possible.</p>

      <p>As of today, the <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">Android bug bounty</a> covers the following devices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</li>
        <li>Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL</li>
        <li>Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL</li>
        <li>Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, the new $1.5 million top prize is reserved for <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/pixel-3">Pixel 3</a>/<a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/pixel-3-xl">Pixel 3 XL</a> and newer devices as they feature Google's Titan M security chip. Titan M is responsible for securing the bootloader, on-device encryption, lock screen protection, and generating (and storing) private keys for apps.</p>
      <p>As Google explains, the "Top prize of $1 million for a full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence which compromises the Titan M secure element on Pixel devices." If that exploit chain is then combined with exploits in "specific developer preview versions of Android", a 50 percent bonus is enacted, which brings the total to the aforementioned $1.5 million.</p>
      <p>According to Google, it has paid over $1.5 million to researchers over the past year for discovering exploits via its bug bounty program. The highest payout to-date weighs in at $201,337 and it was awarded to a member of the Alpha Lab division of Qihoo 360 Technology.</p>
