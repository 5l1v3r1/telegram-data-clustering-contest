      <p>Tesco stores across Mayo are calling on customers and locals alike to drop in-store on December 6 and 7 to join Tesco colleagues for a series of ‘Festive Fun Days’ in aid of charity partner, Temple Street Children’s University Hospital.</p>
      <p>Seasonal cheer is set to top the shopping list as customers are treated to a selection of festive fun including Christmassy cake sale, fun face painters, limited edition festive floral bouquets and Jingles the Penguin soft toys, all in aid of raising much needed funds for sick children this Christmas.</p>
      <p>Hosted by Tesco colleagues across Mayo, this year’s series of ‘Festive Fun Days’ aim to raise €150,000 for the little heroes of Temple Street, with all of the vital funds raised going toward purchasing an advanced retinal camera for the theatre ward, needed for Temple Street to ensure that each child receives the best care possible.</p>
      <p>Using this new equipment, an ophthalmologist can ensure timely intervention, which can prevent loss of sight and in the case of Retinal cancer can cure many cases.</p>
      <p>Geraldine Casey, Director, Tesco Ireland said: “Due to the incredible support received from Tesco customers last year, we are delighted to announce the return of our ‘Festive Fun Days’ across our 151 stores nationwide.</p>
      <p>“Last year was a great success in terms of generosity and community spirit, with Temple Street proving to have a special place in everyone’s heart.</p>
      <p>“We are so happy to be able to bring our colleagues and customers together to help the little heroes of Temple Street at this special time of the year.</p>
      <p>"We encourage everyone to drop in store to embrace the joy of Christmas and get involved in this year’s festive fun!”</p>
      <p>Denise Fitzgerald, CEO of the Temple Street Foundation added: “On behalf of us all here in Temple Street, we would like to thank the Tesco staff and customers for their on-going support and kindness towards our little patients and their families.</p>
      <p>“Their goodwill and generosity continues to be incredibly uplifting and has brought long lasting difference to the lives of sick children and their families in our hospital.</p>
      <p>"We are tremendously grateful to everyone involved in the fundraising initiatives this Christmas season, which will allow us to continue to help make Temple Street as magical as possible for our little patients over the festive period and into the future.”</p>
      <p>Tesco customers and colleagues will also be able to support the little heroes of Temple Street by purchasing limited edition festive floral bouquets and children’s favourite, Jingles the Penguin soft toys, with funds from each sale going directly to Temple Street.</p>
