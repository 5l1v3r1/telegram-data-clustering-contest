      <h1>High drama as BJP tries to persuade JD(S) candidate Ashok Pujari to withdraw</h1>

      <p>Attempts by BJP leaders Umesh Katti and Mahantesh Kavatagimath MLC to convince Janata Dal (S) candidate in Gokak Ashok Pujari to withdraw from the fray failed after high drama.</p>
      <p>Mr. Katti and Mr. Kavatagimath spent some time with Mr. Pujari trying to persuade him to withdraw, but his supporters strongly opposed it. They even began a dharna opposing the BJP’s attempts.</p>
      <p>When Mr. Kavatagimath asked Mr. Pujari to go with him to the tahasildar’s office to withdraw his nominations, Mr. Pujari’s supporters shouted slogans against the BJP and asked Mr. Pujari not to go. The BJP leaders had to return.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kavatagimath told journalists that he and Mr. Pujari have been friends for a long time, and he had come to convince him to withdraw. “I think, he is mentally still in the BJP and was willing to withdraw. But due to the pressure by his supporters he did not,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Katti said that BJP leaders had assured him that Ramesh Jarkiholi would become the Deputy Chief Minister if he won from Gokak. “We are trying to tell Mr. Pujari to withdraw to make it easier for Ramesh Jarkiholi to win. It is unfortunate that he did not withdraw,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Pujari, who lost two elections as a BJP candidate, has filed nominations as a JD(S) candidate. He is expected to cut into the BJP’s votes as he is considered a leader of the Veerashaiva Lingayat community, which forms the core of the BJP’s voter base. Mr Pujari’s continued existence in the hustings seems to add to the BJP’s problems, a BJP leader said.</p>
