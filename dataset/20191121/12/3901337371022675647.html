      <p>In an exclusive feature in this week’s edition of Soccer Laduma, former Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper, William Shongwe explained how he thinks Ernst Middendorp should take on Maritzburg United.</p>
      <p>Amakhosi will lock horns with Maritzburg on Sunday in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout competition and with a spot in the final at stake en-route to their first piece of silverware in years, Chiefs are expected to throw everything at the Team Of Choice.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Soccer Laduma this week, former Chiefs shot-stopper, Shongwe shared his opinion on how the German tactician should approach the encounter.</p>
      <p>“The exact same way he’s been approaching all these other games. He shouldn’t change anything about his team. One thing I believe Ernst has got right is the structure and organisation. Look at the number of goals they’ve conceded, and you can clearly see that there’s a plan and tactical structure in his team. I think that’s what has worked a great deal. Chiefs are playing in a more structured form. They might not be playing that well, but they have good structure and organisation. That’s why they’re playing with a lot of purpose,” he said.</p>
