      <h1>Joe Schmidt reveals reason he left Devin Toner out of World Cup squad</h1>
      <h2>Toner wasn't part of Ireland's 31-man squad for the tournament in Japan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:09:22+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/robert-hynes/" target="_blank">Robert Hynes</a></address>
      <p>Joe Schmidt has revealed that a potential six-week suspension was the reason why he left Devin Toner out of Ireland's Rugby World Cup squad.</p>
      <p>The former Ireland head coach and his management team were alerted that the citing commissioner was looking at an incident involving Toner from their 22-17 win over Wales in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>In his new autobiography Ordinary Joe seen by the Irish Times, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/joe-schmidt">Schmidt</a> writes: "We hadn’t noticed the incident at the time, but we reviewed the incident and it didn’t look good.</p>
      <p>“We had been warned by Alain Rolland, in his presentation to us, that any shoulder-to-head contact was likely to have a starting entry point of a six-week suspension.</p>
      <p>"It was a difficult call, but we decided to go with Tadhg Beirne, who can play both secondrow and backrow, and Jean Kleyn, the only specialist tighthead-scrummaging secondrow in the squad.”</p>
