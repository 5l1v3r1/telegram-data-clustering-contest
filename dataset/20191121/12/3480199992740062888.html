      <p>Despite failings admitted by Shropshire Social Services in a Serious Case Review following Archie’s death, it was found that no action or inaction could have caused or contributed to Lesley Speed’s actions that day.</p>
      <p>Archie was murdered at the family home in Wall under Heywood, near Rushbury, Church Stretton, on September 21, 2017, the day Speed had been due to attend a family court hearing as part of an ongoing custody dispute with Archie’s father Matthew Spriggs.</p>

      <p>Speed was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2018.</p>
      <p>The inquest into Archie’s death lasted six days and heard from 16 witnesses including social workers, teachers, Archie’s GP and police officers.</p>
      <p>Summing up the evidence, Senior Coroner John Ellery said: “This inquest essentially is about causation, to determine whether Archie’s death could have been preventable.</p>
      <p>“This inquest has set out to answer whether there was any state agency failing which reasonably, and without hindsight, could be said to have caused or contributed to Archie’s death.</p>
      <p>“I consider the core issues to surround lost opportunities to hear Archie’s voice.”</p>
      <p>He said there were two missed opportunities for social workers to meet with Archie, the first being in 2014 over an allegation of sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>The second was in the weeks before he died, when a meeting should have been arranged as part of the family court proceedings.</p>
      <p>He said: “What Shropshire Council social services could have done and did not do was to actually speak to Archie and hear his voice.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ellery said Rushbury Church of England Primary School was not at fault. He said: “My overall impression of the witnesses from Rushbury School was that they were professional and caring and did all they reasonably could for Archie.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ellery recorded a ‘short form’ conclusion of unlawful killing, rather than a narrative conclusion which could have named state failings as a contributing factor.</p>
      <p>Mr Ellery said: “Having considered all the evidence and recognising the admitted system failings, I don’t believe on the balance of probabilities that they caused or contributed to Archie’s death or that it could have been prevented.</p>
      <p>"The harsh truth is that Archie’s death was due to the actions of Lesley Speed and no state agency could have reasonably foreseen or predicted the outcome."</p>
