      <p>NORTH VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) – Concerns of a city councillor using “back-channels” to push for a ban on keeping pigeons in the District of North Vancouver – despite a declared conflict of interest – have the mayor calling for an independent review.</p>
      <p>Mayor Mike Little says he’s asked the Chief Administrative Officer David Stuart to commission the review after a Freedom of Information request filed by the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/pigeon-ban-north-van-emails-1.5368530">CBC</a> found Coun. Betty Forbes had been communicating with district staff about a bylaw banning pigeons, although she had declared a conflict of interest. Forbes’ neighbour is the only person who staff believe owns pigeons in the district.</p>
      <p>Little says he’s been hearing a lot of concern from the community about Forbes’ perceived influence in creating the bylaw, despite the fact she recused herself from voting on or discussing it in council chambers.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had Freedom of Information requests that have revealed that there definitely were some back-channel communications taking place, and we want to make sure that both the letter and spirit of the law were followed,” he says.</p>
      <p>Those communications will be reviewed, as well as the mayor’s conduct – and the conduct of all councillors – to see if the Local Government Act and community charter were followed.</p>
      <p>While Little says he still supports the bylaw, he wants to make sure the community has confidence in the council.</p>
      <p>“It’s critically important that the community has confidence both in the decisions we make, but in the processes that we follow as a municipality. And this was one way that we could go back, review it, make sure the best practices were followed, make sure that if the spirit of the law was not followed, that we’ve come up with some actions to correct that matter,” he says.</p>
      <p>The district has had a bylaw allowing pigeon keeping since 1971, but a bylaw banning them passed Nov. 4.</p>
