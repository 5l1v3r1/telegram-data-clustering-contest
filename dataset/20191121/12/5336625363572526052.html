      <h1>Mark Zuckerberg had dinner with Trump, but Facebook wants you to know it's no biggie</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:48:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/stan-schroeder/" target="_blank">Stan Schroeder</a></address>
      <p>Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, the social media company that's been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/facebook-election-war-room/">under scrutiny</a> for possibly allowing fake news to influence the 2016 U.S. general election (the same very close election that Donald Trump won), had a previously undisclosed dinner with the president of the United States, it has been revealed.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-hosted-zuckerberg-undisclosed-dinner-white-house-october-n1087986">NBC News</a>, the dinner also included Facebook board member Peter Thiel and took place at the White House in October. That was just after Zuckerberg testified before Congress on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/facebook-libra-deep-dive/">Libra</a>, a cryptocurrency platform and stablecoin that Facebook and partners aim to launch next year. </p>
      <p>Facebook confirmed to NBC News that the dinner happened with a short, no-big-deal, business-as-usual, why-do-you-even-ask statement. </p>
      <p>“As is normal for a CEO of a major U.S. company, Mark accepted an invitation to have dinner with the President and First Lady at the White House,” a Facebook spokesperson told NBC. </p>
      <p>There's no word about what was discussed during dinner. </p>

      <p>Zuckerberg met with Trump at the Oval Office in September as well, but that meeting was disclosed to the public. </p>
      <p>Notably, Facebook still allows politicians to tell untruths in their ads, whereas Google assumed a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-political-ad-targeting/">slightly tougher stance</a> just earlier today, and Twitter <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-ends-political-advertisements/">banned</a> political advertising altogether in September. </p>
