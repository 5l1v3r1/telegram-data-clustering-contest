        <b>Ulster and Clermont Auvergne have named their respective sides for Friday night’s Round 2 Heineken Champions Cup clash at the Kingspan Stadium (KO 7.45pm).</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both sides are coming into this match off the back of opening-round wins. Ulster claimed at scalp at the Rec as they overcame Bath 17-16 while Clermont thrashed Harlequins at home on a final scoreline of 53-21.</p>
      <p>Ulster head coach Dan McFarland has made four changes to the starting side which took on Bath last week.</p>
      <p>Louis Ludik comes onto the right-wing where he will join Will Addison at fullback and Jacob Stockdale on the left-wing.</p>
      <p>The three remaining changes are in the pack.</p>
      <p>Eric O’Sullivan comes into the side to start at loosehead as he partners up with Rob Herring and Marty Moore in the front-row.</p>
