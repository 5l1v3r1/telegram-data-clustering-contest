      <p><b>Update:</b> <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></b> certainly got off to an excellent start in Japan (see the original story below), and the country's official Pokémon Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1197447168304537600?s=20">has now tweeted</a> that sales have been very good elsewhere, too.</p>
      <p>According to the tweet and <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/corporate/PostImages/b1b2b7b4ea55eef149f2bc849c194eea958c68c6.pdf">an official announcement</a>, worldwide sales of Pokémon Sword and Shield currently stand at over 6 million copies after its first week of release, putting it ahead of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate"><b>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</b></a> as the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game after one week:</p>

      <p>The games sold over 2 million copies in the US alone, making them the '<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191121005357/en/">highest-grossing</a>' launch ever for the Pokémon series. That statement is carefully-worded - as a $60 game it seems to have made more money in the US than any past Pokémon titles in its first week on sale, although most of them launched at a significantly cheaper RRP. Still, it seems the mixed reception with fans hasn't hurt sales of the game.</p>

        <b>Original Story: Wed 20th Nov, 2019 11:30 GMT</b>
      </p>
      <p>While <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/feature_best_pokemon_games_of_all_time">Pokémon</a></b> is unquestionably a worldwide phenomenon, it's especially popular in its native Japan, as the first sales figures for <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword And Shield</a></b> can attest.</p>
      <p>The latest mainline entry in the series has sold 1,364,544 physical copies in its first three days of release. that impressive total includes boxed units – (both Sword, Shield and the double pack) and download cards, but does not factor in digital sales, so the actual number is bound to be much higher.</p>
      <p>That stunning opening means that Pokémon Sword And Shield has beaten the previous fastest-seller in Japan, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> – which cleared 1.23 million units in the same timeframe.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/nintendo_switch_looks_set_to_end_ps4s_five-year_reign_in_the_uk">Just like in the UK</a>, the release of Sword and Shield has given Switch hardware figures a welcome boost, too. A whopping 180,136 Switch systems were sold between November 11th and 17th. However, it's worth noting that around 100,000 more were sold in the week that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launched.</p>
      <p>In short, Sword and Shield have provided Nintendo with yet another smash hit – and plenty of forward momentum as we head into the holiday season.</p>
