      <p>Conservative Owen Paterson, hoping to be re-elected in the North Shropshire seat he has held since 1997, called into Lily the Pink florist in Ellesmere as he took to the campaign trail.</p>
      <p>Mr Paterson, an outspoken Brexiteer, said: "Great to drop into Lily the Pink in Ellesmere, another local business which wants to end the uncertainty."</p>
      <p>The former environment secretary, who has held North Shropshire since 1997, also visited farm machinery dealer K O Machines, which is the main Massey Ferguson dealer for Shropshire and Staffordshire.</p>

      <p>He said the company, based in Coven, near Wolverhampton, was looking forward to the opportunity presented by Brexit.</p>
      <p>"It was great to talk to a thriving agricultural machinery business excited by the opportunities for UK agriculture to boom once we end the uncertainty," Mr Paterson added.</p>
      <p>He had also been out canvassing in Market Drayton.</p>
      <p>Also contesting the seat, where Mr Paterson is defending a majority of 16,355, are Graeme Currie for Labour, Helen Morgan for the Liberal Democrats, John Adams for the Greens and Robert Jones for the Shropshire Party.</p>
