      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Fired Apprentice star Ryan-Mark Parsons said that candidates tried to 'play happy families' when they were back at the house - but it was anything but</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:41:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>This year's Apprentice candidates were more divided than ever as tensions escalated and backstabbing ensured amid tasks.</p>
      <p>And it didn't stop when they left the boardroom, with recently fired star Ryan-Mark Parsons telling us that the house was "psychologically challenging" and that some candidates were "isolated".</p>
      <p>In particular, he said that Marianne was "very alone", while there were two groups who didn't like each other.</p>
      <p>This comes amid recent controversy surrounding Lottie Lion's comments in the candidates' WhatsApp group, which were branded racist.</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark said that in the house, candidates "tried to be happy", but many found it difficult because of the intense tasks.</p>

      <p>Following his firing yesterday, Ryan-Mark told Mirror TV about the house: "It's quite psychologically challenging because we'd have these clashes in the boardroom yet when we come back to the house we have to play happy families.</p>
      <p>"It was problematic, because I'm quite straight-forward and blank and I don't like all this sort of acting, I guess you could say.</p>
      <p>"We tried to be happy but with some people, you know how they feel and they're a bit sour."</p>

      <p>Asked who he got on best with, he said: "Overall, I got on with quite a lot of people - Thomas, Dean, on a personal level, Lewis, really liked Lewis, Lottie. Just some people like Marianne, Jemelin, Riyonn, I didn't like at all."</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/secret-unaired-apprentice-row-saw-20922307">blasting Marianne for being a "troll"</a> , he said that she was a bit of a loner in the house.</p>
      <p>Ryan Mark said: "Even in the house, Marianne was very isolated, she was very alone in the house.</p>
      <p>"She was quite close to Scarlett but I don't know whether that was because of her age, Marianne was very aloof."</p>
