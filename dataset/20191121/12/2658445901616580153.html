      <p>A hospital, a supposed drug addict, his loving girlfriend and a strict mission-based university.  Throw in a little bit of reckless sexual escapade caught on tape and the plot of a juicy scandal is complete.</p>
      <p>This is the latest scandal that has been setting social media on fire since Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The lovebirds, a 300 level student of Babcock University, Ogun State and her 400 level boyfriend, were shown on a leaked tape having a go at in a private room at Saint Bridget Hospital, Abeokuta, Ogun State.</p>
      <p>The story making the rounds is that the boy was in a rehabilitation centre at the time for drugs and other misdemeanours. His girlfriend visited him and he persuaded her to allow him record their sex session as a sort of keepsake for lonely nights. The girl consented. But the video got into the hands of a third party and was uploaded to the internet.</p>

      <p>Babcock University is a private Christian co-educational university owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The university is located at Ilishan-Remo equidistant between Ibadan and Lagos. Enrolment was about 6,000 as of 2009. Wikipedia</p>
      <p>In a statement issued yesterday evening, Joshua Suleiman, the varsity’s director, communication and marketing, confirmed the video, but said the persons involved in the sex tape are no longer students of the institution.</p>
      <p>According to him, “the boy was expelled from the school in February this year”, while “his girlfriend” was asked to leave the school shortly after the video broke out – some months ago.</p>
      <p>He confirmed that the incident took place last April at Saint Bridget Hospital, Abeokuta and not on the school premises.</p>
      <p>“The video above referred is, unfortunately, a sad commentary on the moral decadence that has assailed our society at large, a manner of behaviour that is alien and antithetical to the value of our university. It is not worth a tinge of fascination, but a ground of great concern for all,” the statement reads.</p>
      <p>“The boy in the video was expelled from Babcock University in February this year after investigation and the due process proved that he was into certain grievous misconducts, the acts for which the university has zero-tolerance.</p>
      <p>“His girlfriend in the same video, until the video broke out, was a third-year student of accounting of this university. After due process, she was expelled from the university for violation of university rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>“The place where the immoral act took place, according to her written statement, was at Saint Bridget Hospital, Abeokuta, Ogun State, where the boy has been undergoing rehabilitation for different destructive addictions.</p>
      <p>“According to the girl, the incident took place in April this year during school vacation when she visited the boy at the hospital. The act did not take place at Babcock University.</p>
      <p>“Babcock University remains committed to the highest moral standards and would remain a standard-bearer for quality education in standard character, learning and in service to humanity. We are happy to be saddled with this challenge as an institution because it propels us to contribute to the greatness of this nation and the security of a bright future for our children.”</p>

          <u>Lekki pastor</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>In November last year, there was a leaked video of a pastor in Lagos, Chris Omatsola, and his lover.</p>
      <p>Omatsola, who leads Zionwealth of Life Assembly, said his ex-lover, Tamaratokoni Okpewho, recorded the videos on their phones because she enjoyed filming their intimate moments.</p>
      <p>The pastor, in a lengthy post on his blog, Zionweath News, said: “Princess and I had more than 10 sex tapes of ourselves on our phones as she enjoyed filming sex. I had deleted all our sex videos on my phone and she was aware and insisted she delete hers.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, the sex-tapes were recorded sometimes in October 2017. She was holding the camera in some and I held the camera in others. We were both aware but we never knew it would go viral.</p>
      <p>“This day, I make bold to say with all honesty of heart and sincerity of purpose that it is true that I committed sexual fornication with Ms. Princess Tamaratokoni Okpewho.</p>
      <p>“I have since repented and God has forgiven me. But I did not post our sex-tapes on the internet or assaulted her physically as she maliciously and fallaciously claimed and want us all to believe.</p>
      <p>“I met Princess Tamaratokoni Okpewho aka Toks David in September 2017, just before the Lekki Toll Gate after Quilox nightclub around 4:40 a.m.</p>
      <p>“I was returning from a vigil in Adetokunbo Ademola, Victoria Island, that fateful day. She flagged down my car on the lonely road. She appeared drunk. Because it was dark and I thought it could be dangerous, I stopped and picked her.</p>
      <p>“When we got to my house that night, she slept on the couch in the sitting room, while I slept in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>“I also think ministers of God should learn from my fall. Watch your steps because the devil is on your tail.</p>
      <p>“Be careful with women. Prayerfully help people. If you have fallen, don’t cover up. Seek God’s face with penitence and repentance.”</p>
      <p>Ms Okpewho accused Omatsola of releasing the video to force her into marrying him, an allegation he denied and accused Ms Okpewho of demanding N200 million from him.</p>
      <p>The scandal forced Omatsola to relocate his church.</p>

          <u>What the law says</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>No one knows who leaked the tape, but whoever did broke the law.</p>
      <p>Nigerian law has been reworked and updated; however, some parts meant to curtail some sexual offences have been left untouched.</p>
      <p>Section 233(d)(1) of the Criminal Code Act criminalises publication of obscenity.</p>
      <p>“Any person who, whether for gain  or not, distributes or projects any article deemed to be obscene for the purposes of this Chapter, commits an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding four hundred naira or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or by both.”</p>

      <p>Unless you were a Nollywood addict, you had probably never heard of Etinosa Idemudia before March 2019. That was the date she became famous (or infamous) for the craziest reason ever.</p>
      <p>Last March, the Nollywood actress went viral on social media after she stripped naked on an Instagram Live broadcast on Nigerian singer, MC Galaxy’s page.</p>
      <p>Explaining her actions later, Etinosa said she acted under the influence of alcohol and she should have been careful with her drink.</p>
      <p>In a chat with PulseTV, she said: “The people who are judging at the moment, I don’t really blame you guys, it’s fine because I put myself in the spot and I take full responsibility for the incident. I should have been more responsible, I should have been more careful with alcohol, with expressing myself and with whatever it is I want to do. All I have to do now is to ask God for forgiveness and move on.”</p>

      <p>Following the backlash that trailed her Instagram scandal, Etinosa placed her Instagram page on private.</p>

      <p>Reacting to the leaked tape scandal yesterday, Nigerian rapper Ycee criticised those judging the students.</p>
      <p>He suggested that many of the people criticising the duo on Twitter had probably made sex tapes of their own.</p>
      <p>“So all of a sudden nobody on Twitter has recorded themselves in the act of sex … sha na the person wey them catch be thief.”</p>
      <p>If you’re like most people, you’ve probably been tempted to make a homemade sextape. Should you give in to the temptation?” he posted on his Twitter handle.</p>
      <p>Is Ycee right? Are we mostly closet exhibitionists? Anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that some people are.</p>
      <p>Should you indulge the temptation to record yourself in the act?</p>
      <p>Anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that some people are.</p>
      <p>When the question ‘Why do people videotape while having sex?’ popped up on social media site Quora, it racked up 23,000 views.</p>
      <p>A Quora member, Anubhav Bhatnagar, who answered the question, said: “1. Fetish: Different people have different people fetish, there is a possibility that those who record themselves while having sex {with/without consent of the other partner(s) believes it gives them more pleasure.</p>
      <p>“2. Keeping memory: Yeah, some people have a habit of keeping/recording memories/moments, so for then having sex is a moment and so there is a possibility that they do this to keep it as a memory. {with/without consent of their partner(s)</p>
      <p>“3. Another fetish: Some people like to have sex while watching Porn. This fetish might have given them an idea of recording themself so that they can watch it the next time, they are having sex.</p>
      <p>“4. For show-off: Some people, usually young lads (male), like to show-off their sex moments with their friends, that they had sex, without caring that what they are doing is an offence. This usually gave rise to leaked tapes/clips.</p>
      <p>“5. Defame someone: Whether it be male or female, both can easily be defamed, if their sexual clips are leaked by someone intentionally. Though female partners are framed most of the times, in such clips the face of the executor is blurred, while the victim’s is highlighted.”</p>
      <p>An American George Sawyer, gave perhaps the most sensible answer.</p>
      <p>Sawyer, who said he had been “teaching courses on sex and sensuality since 1989, advised couples not to go down that road.</p>

          <i>He said: “Recording during sex? Never! Don’t. It’s a huge mistake. You should assume that any form of digital recording you make will escape captivity and find its way onto the internet. Recordings can escape even with the good faith of everyone involved.</i>

      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>“Pretty much everything gets backed up into the cloud now, accounts get hacked. Is a copy of the recording on a phone, a tablet or a laptop? Devices can be lost or stolen.</p>
      <p>“Murphy’s Law almost guarantees awkward recordings will then surface at the worst possible time: job interviews, dating, your mother’s birthday. If you are a woman it may possibly ‘ruin’ your life at that time.”</p>
