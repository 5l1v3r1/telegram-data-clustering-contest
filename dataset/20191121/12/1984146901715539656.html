      <p>A new homeware shop is set to open in Durham city, creating 80 jobs.</p>
      <p>The Range will open on Friday at 9am, selling home leisure and gardens products across 16 departments.</p>
      <p>There will also be an Iceland Foods and family cafe at the Dragon Lane Retail Park outlet.  </p>
      <p>It will create 80 full and part-time jobs which includes store and department managers, warehouse workers and retail assistants.</p>
      <p>Chris Dawson, the founder of the firm, commented on the upcoming opening: “The Durham store has been in the pipeline for some time with it being a new build site.</p>
      <p>"It is exciting that we are now ready to welcome our customers to the newly developed Dragon Lane Retail Park and we are thrilled to be bringing a new national retailer to the town.</p>
      <p>"The job provision that comes with the new store, especially with it being a new build, should be a great boost to the local area."</p>
      <p>There will be a number of new stores offers for customers, which will run until December 8.</p>
      <p>Mayor of Durham, Councillor Katie Corrigan, will open the shop and there will be in-store events after the grand openings that will include a £250 Range gift card competition with Metro Radio.</p>
      <p>There will be a giveaway for the first 50 people in the queue and activities for children in the opening day, with a range of free demos taking place over opening weekend.</p>
