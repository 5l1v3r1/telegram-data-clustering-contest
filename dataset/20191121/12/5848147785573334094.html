      <h1>Former newsreader Simone Semmens jailed for GST fraud</h1>

      <p>A former Victorian beauty queen has only her stubbornness to blame for being jailed over a $1.7 million GST bill owed to the tax office.</p>
      <p>Simone Semmens was found guilty of 10 charges of dishonestly withholding tax payments owed after a two-week trial in the Victorian County Court.</p>
      <p>The former Miss Victoria Grocery Industry winner didn’t pay GST on a $7.5 million property at Portsea, a $7.8 million mansion at Caulfield North and a Toorak property valued at more than a million dollars.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old, whose beauty pageant success launched her into a TV career, was in denial about the money owed, County Court Judge Scott Johns said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“You remained stubborn and steadfast that you did not owe GST or tax at crucial times,” the judge said while sentencing her.</p>
      <p>The former Seven Network presenter was in denial and had worked to convince others she was not liable to pay the tax on the properties, Judge Johns said.</p>
      <p>“You have only your intransigence and stubbornness to blame.”</p>
      <p>Semmens “ignored advice” she did not want to hear, he told the court.</p>
      <p>“The tragedy of your current situation, it needn’t have come to this,” he said as there were multiple times it could have been resolved before trial.</p>
      <p>Semmens, who worked as a real estate agent in the United States, would struggle to re-enter that country after being jailed, the court was told.</p>
      <p>Throughout her life it was clear she had demonstrated resilience and resourcefulness, scaling heights she may never have dreamed of, Judge Johns said.</p>
      <p>“Your fall from grace has been dramatic.”</p>
      <p>He took into account the serious nature of the offending, her “excellent” prospects of rehabilitation and the significant delay in the case.</p>
      <p>Semmens was jailed for 34 months, to be released after she serves 14 months.</p>
      <p>She was ordered to be of good behaviour for two years after her release.</p>
