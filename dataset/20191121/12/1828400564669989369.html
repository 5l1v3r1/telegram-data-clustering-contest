      <p>Halloween turned into a nightmare for a woman driving home from a party in her costume.</p>
      <p>Micha McDonnell became distracted by a group of revellers coming out of a pub and crashed into a parked people carrier while she was more than twice over the alcohol limit.</p>
      <p>McDonnell, 25, of Newton Place, Normoss, pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol.</p>
      <p>She was disqualified from driving for 20 months, fined £220 with £85 costs and ordered to pay £32 victims’ surcharge.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor, Pam Smith, said police were called to an accident on Lytham Road, South Shore, on November 3, at about midnight, where McDonnell had collided with a parked Vauxhall Zafira in her Fiat Punto.</p>
      <p>The Zafira was shunted into the middle of the road. McDonnell remained in her car and repeatedly apologised and asked if anyone was hurt.</p>
      <p>A breath test showed 77 microgrammes of alcohol in her body – 35 is the limit.</p>
      <p>Hugh Pond, defending, said his client, who had no previous convictions, had been to a Halloween party and was in a costume.</p>
      <p>She had intended staying the night at the address where the party was held but there was a disagreement and she decided to leave.</p>
      <p>McDonnell had committed the offence totally by mistake believing it was safe to drive.</p>

      <p>They ordered the imported car be given back to David Levi, 43, of Arundel Road, St Annes, by Lancashire Police who had seized it under Proceeds of Crime legislation.</p>
      <p>The court accepted he earned a living out of hiring the car out to TV and film companies and to individuals.</p>
      <p>However, Blackpool Magistrates refused Levi’s application to have a coat and pair of shoes returned to him.</p>
      <p>Levi told Blackpool Magistrates:” I sell the Big Issue magazine on the streets.</p>
      <p>“It is very cold and I need my Canada Goose coat back and my Hugo Boss shoes. The coat is warm but isn’t worth much because of the cigarette burns on it. I cannot understand why the police want it.”</p>
      <p>The court said the police could retain the coat and shoes for a further 16 days until another Proceeds of Crime hearing is due.</p>
      <p>However, the ruled in favour of Levi’s application that the car should not have been detained as it was his way of making a living.</p>
