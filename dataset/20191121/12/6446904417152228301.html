      <p>THE CHRISTMAS BONUS for social welfare recipients is set to be paid out in the first week of December. </p>
      <p>This year the payment will be given to over 1.2 million recipients.</p>
      <p>Social Protection Minister Regina Doherty said the payments for pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and people who are long-term unemployed will be retained at 100% this year.</p>
      <p>“Last year, I was particularly pleased to announce the restoration of the additional Christmas Payment at a rate of 100%. I am very happy that despite the current climate of uncertainty generated by Brexit, the Christmas payment will again be paid at a rate of 100% this year.</p>
      <p>“This payment will help those people meet the extra expenses incurred over the Christmas period as well as provide an additional boost for local economies,” Doherty said. </p>
      <p>The cost of the Christmas bonus this year will be €279.4 million. </p>
      <p>Abolished in 2009, the Christmas bonus was partially restored by the then Tánaiste Joan Burton in 2014 and increased to the current 100% rate last year. </p>
