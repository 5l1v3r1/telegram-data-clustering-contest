      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:46:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://en.annahar.com/author/25312-saeb-el-zein" target="_blank">Saeb El Zein</a></address>
      <p>It seems clear that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a better option for Lebanon since Godot will only make us wait, wait, and wait amid an economic slippery slope.From my experience, there are three key reasons why the IMF is required: First, Lebanon doesn’t appear to have a proposed plan to get out of its current economic situation; second, Lebanon doesn’t have the mechanism nor the experience to execute a recovery process; and third, the IMF will add credibility to the recovery process, enhancing its chances of success.Lebanon’s officials keep reassuring us that our deposits are safe, our currency is under control, and the fiscal deficit is going to be addressed while reiterating that we’re facing very difficult times and that the demonstrators’ demands will be addressed. However, I have learned over the past thirty years that our officials’ promises are like Godot. So, what’s the current economic situation like?Our currency has already depreciated by 20% in an open and free market, our deposits in USD aren’t freely available, we can barely transfer funds from Lebanon, credit facilities have been reduced or canceled, the banks have been reducing their loan portfolios to the private sector since the beginning of 2019, and they have halted totally most lending few weeks ago. This is a huge risk event known as the "Sudden Stop event."This event means Sudden Stop of economic activity as most of our companies and individuals borrow to finance their daily operations, spending, and investments and all of a sudden, their credit lines are reduced or canceled.Given the monetary multiplier impact of this Sudden Stop of banks’ lending, this is expected to lead to a substantial contraction of the Lebanese economy in the following one to twelve-month period. In turn, it can lead to an increased unemployment rate in the private sector, a sharp drop in spending on investments and consumption, a significant increase in banks’ non-performing loans, lower real estate prices, escalated social and economic unrest, and higher poverty levels. Although our officials are hopeful that the situation will improve after a difficult period, none are formulating strategies to deal with the clearly serious economic situation. As they have always done, the officials will continue to throw the fireball on each other. They promise that a new government will have to deal with the situation, which is another Godot to wait for, especially that a new government won’t be able to do so alone, given the gravity and the complication of the economic situation.In my opinion, the only feasible strategy is to request from a credible, experienced, and professional organization to lead and organize the required hard economic restructuring and reforms required with the backing of the current parliament and population. This very difficult task falls within the IMF’s scope of work and experience. Many of our politicians and financial public and private experts criticize the IMF with little justification, and part of the criticism is due to political reasons, while another is the fear of resulting economic hardships from the implementation of difficult structural reforms. The negative criticism often stems from the usual fear that our governing officials will gain more economic-political control and earn benefits that are associated with such control.From a geopolitical perspective, the IMF has already been working closely and successfully with many countries in the region, including Iran from one side and Saudi Arabia from another. In any case, our government and parliament are the ultimate decision-makers of any IMF program, and they agree and oversee the severity of its implementation.  The longer we delay the reforms, the harder these reforms will have to be with or without the IMF. We must face reality, and unfortunately, we don’t have a choice, and the difficult and harsh reforms have to be applied as soon as possible.Lebanon's current situation reminds us of what happened in Egypt a few years ago. In 2015, Egypt was facing a challenging and dire economic situation with a debt/GDP in excess of 120%, resulting in dwindling external central bank’s reserves that were sufficient to cover only just 1-2 month of imports, an artificially high fixed exchange rate, currency controls to transfer funds out of the country, foreign exchange available only in the black market, credit cards limits, current account of - 8% deficit and fiscal deficit of -12 % , decelerating economic growth rate, rising unemployment rate, international rating agencies that lowered their debt rating from BB+ to B- in a few years, bond prices under severe pressure, foreign investors that withdrew billions of dollars of investments from Egypt, and uprisings and social unrest. The friendly countries to Egypt like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, and, Turkey, transferred billions of dollars to the central bank and the government in support of the Egyptian economy. This was not enough to stabilize the situation, as Egypt didn’t develop then a credible economic reform and restructuring program to deal with socio-economic hardships, such as freeing the exchange rate, subsidy reform, tracking corruption, increasing tax revenues, introducing a social safety net, etc... Numerous Egyptian governments weren’t able to pursue and execute a comprehensive program as they lacked the experience.Finally, after many years of hesitating to ask the IMF to take the lead, the Egyptian government finally decided to do it. Today, and only three and a half years later, Egypt is economically a new country on an upward economic trajectory of 5.5% plus growth, and on the verge of a sustained positive economic activity. US dollars are widely available, the black market for dollars has disappeared, there are no currency transfers restrictions, unemployment rate is dropping, Egyptian pound is appreciating and is at a 3 years high (after depreciating 3 years ago), inflation is dropping sharply to single digits, the central bank reserves are at all times high, interest rates are dropping sharply, foreign investments are increasing, government fiscal and current account deficits have halved (as % of GDP) with a balance of payment surpluses, and the international rating agencies are upgrading the Egyptian credit.   It’s important to mention that the program was designed and executed in a way to minimize the impact on the lower class with a motto of creating a “Social safety net” to the poorer Egyptians all in agreement, close cooperation, and execution with the Egyptian authorities.So, let’s take the hard decision and admit that we can’t fix our economic situation by ourselves and resort to the IMF today to deal with the socio-economic repercussions of our failure and limit and distribute the losses fairly among stakeholders. The parliament and/or central bank must initiate this action today in order to manage the dire situation we’re in, instead of playing the blame game or dodging responsibility while hiding in their cocoons and expecting the Lebanese to wait for another Godot. ----<i><b>Saeb El Zein is an emerging market professional. </b></i> Related Articles <a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1072867-lebanons-leaders-make-joint-appearance-at-military-parade">Lebanon’s leaders make joint appearance at military parade </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1072633-session-of-lebaneseamerican-who-dealt-with-israel-postponed"> Session of Lebanese-American who dealt with Israel postponed </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1072396-soldier-who-shot-lebanese-protester-dead-charged-with-murder"> Soldier who shot Lebanese protester dead charged with murder</a></p>
