      <p>Sometimes its nice to take a digital detox from skimming your Instagram feed of others people's travels and instead bury yourself into a good book. And in 2019, authors in the travel category did not disappoint. From a photographer who braved the Great Plains to chase storms while others sought shelter to a journalist who embarked on a 45,000-mile trek via train that circumnavigated the globe, these books will take you on a series of journeys that will not only provide you with new insight into the world we live in, but perhaps also inspire you to get out there and explore places that you've only seen on your computer screen.</p>
