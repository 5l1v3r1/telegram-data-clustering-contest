      <p>Burna Boy’s 19- track album was listed in the “Best World Music Album” category alongside “Celia” by sensational singer Angelique Kidjo, amongst others.</p>
      <p>This clearly indicates that Manifest automatically earns a credit for his contribution to the album.</p>
      <p>This is also a big win for Ghana as Shatta Wale and Manifest were the only two artists to be credited for the Grammys.</p>
      <p>Maifest has worked with Damon Albarn, Flea, Tony Allen, Erykah Badu, and is featured on five songs on the Rocket Juice and The Moon album.</p>
