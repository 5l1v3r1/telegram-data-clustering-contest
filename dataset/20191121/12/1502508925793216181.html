      <p>Leasing of office space by co-working players dropped 40 per cent to 2 million sq ft during the July-September period in India, according to property consultant <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cbre">CBRE.</a></p>
      <p>The overall flexible space take up in Q3 (July-September) 2019 stood at 2 million sq ft as against 3.3 million sq ft in the year-ago period, the company said.</p>
      <p>However, leasing of commercial space by co-working operators rose 12 per cent to 7.2 million sq ft during January-September period of 2019 as against 6.4 million sq ft in the year-ago period, according to CBRE's report titled 'India Flexible Space Digest Q3 2019'.</p>
      <p>"We expect that landlords will increasingly cater to occupier interest by providing space-as-a-service on demand. Given that the Indian flexible space market is one of the biggest across APAC, we anticipate that this segment will remain high on the investor radar as well," said Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cbre">CBRE.</a></p>
      <p>Magazine said he expects flexible space leasing to be around 9 million sq ft in 2019 and around 9-10 million sq ft in 2020.</p>
