      <h1>Parker: Brookman clan grows with addition of daughter to West Canadian leadership</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:05+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Parker, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>George Brookman’s favourite TV show was probably Family Matters, as his family has always mattered so much to him and his business. He has decided to step back and leave the running of his West Canadian Digital Imaging to his daughter, Karen, as the new president and CEO, and her sister, Jennifer, has joined the leadership team as vice-president of marketing.</p>
      <p>Karen says running West Canadian as a true family business was, “always meant to be — but we didn’t know it.”</p>
      <p>More than 35 years ago, George first walked into West Canadian Graphics and West Canadian Color. “There were no cellphones, no desktop computers, and the word ‘digital’ wasn’t even in the daily lexicon.”</p>
      <p>Since its beginning in 1952 it has been a market leader in adapting new technologies, helping it grow from a traditional microfilm and reprographic service provider to a modern document management company with services that range from digital printing, signage and graphic design, to enterprise content management, digital imaging and on-site managed services.</p>
      <p>Karen moved back to Calgary and her father’s company last year as part owner in the role of chief innovation officer after 30 years living in Ontario. After graduating from Ryerson she spent five years working in the fashion industry before teaming up with George to launch Commonwealth Legal to provide automated litigation support services for Canada’s largest law firms.</p>
      <p>That company was acquired by Ricoh Canada in 2014, and Karen led its highest performing business unit as vice-president of services and the Canadian leader on the firm’s global executive team.</p>
      <p>Happy to be back in Calgary and eager to use her experience to help her father, Karen quickly became embroiled in all aspects of the business and developed a new business strategy for the company that leverages its strengths in the areas of customer service and technical expertise.</p>
      <p>Now, with principal shareholder George assuming the role of chairman and company ambassador, Karen and Jennifer will lead a strong and experienced management team, each with a keen commitment to uphold the corporate culture.</p>
      <p>Jennifer was a vice-president of Ricoh eDiscovery based in Vancouver and led its North American team in strategic and digital marketing. Rob Steed has been with West Canadian for 20 years and is director of managed services and Calgary operations; Thomas Cancilla, who has 10 years with the company, is director of Edmonton operations and the signage business across Alberta; and Lindsay Duprey is vice-president of technical services and innovation, based in the firm’s Toronto office.</p>
      <p>Orange Door is a core division of West Canadian that specializes in creative design and direct mail, but is going through some restructuring. Its director, Kathy Levinski, has been its leader for the past 11 years but will be leaving on good terms to oversee direct mail operations for Canada Post; meanwhile, 20-year staffer Vivian Brill is running Orange Door.</p>
      <p>Another key area of the business is printing photo books, reproducing personal treasures into a hardcover book format. This department is about to be strengthened with a contract to be a fulfilment house — assembling, printing and distributing — for a U.S. publisher of children’s books that are personalized by inserting photographs.</p>
      <p>With strong representation in Edmonton, Fort McMurray, Vancouver and Toronto, Karen is planning an expansion of West Canadian into the international marketplace from its Calgary head office.</p>
      <p>George has accomplished an outstanding succession plan to create new opportunities for its employees to thrive and grow their careers at another Calgary-based company that is a recognized leader in its field.</p>
      <p>Notes:</p>
      <p>Calgary developer XYC Design + Development has completed construction of M2, its four-storey mixed-use development along the Riverfront in East Village adjacent to the historic Simmons building. Featuring 7,400 square feet of village-style retail space at ground level with unique office and residential above, XYC Design + Development president Kate MacGregor has confirmed the Concorde Group will occupy a restaurant space spilling out onto RiverWalk Plaza, and Bow Cycle will operate a store focusing on e-bike sales and rentals.</p>
