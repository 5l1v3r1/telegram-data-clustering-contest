      <h1>Former Twitter employee accused of spying for Saudis pleads not guilty</h1>
      <h2>Judge orders release by next week.</h2>

      <p>A former Twitter employee accused of spying for Saudi Arabia pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in San Francisco, where he remains in custody.</p>
      <p>Ahmad Abouammo earlier this month was indicted on spying charges along with Ali Alzabarah, another former Twitter employee, and Ahmed Almutairi, who worked for the Saudi royal family.</p>
      <p>The case puts Silicon Valley in the spotlight over protection of personal data, including from tech company employees who have no reason to access the information.</p>
      <p>It also is a public conflict between the United States and an ally.</p>
      <p>According to the complaint, Abouammo repeatedly accessed the Twitter account of a prominent critic of the Saudi royal family in early 2015.</p>
      <p>In one instance, he was able to view the email address and telephone number associated with the account. Abouammo also accessed the account of a second Saudi critic to get information, the complaint said.</p>
      <p>US prosecutors argue that Abouammo, a dual citizen of the United States and Lebanon, presents a flight risk due to large sums of money he had access to from the alleged co-conspirators.</p>
      <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has ordered him to be released next week, but prosecutors are appealing that decision.</p>
      <p>In a hearing on Wednesday afternoon, US District Judge Edward Chen agreed to hear prosecutors' arguments against release and consider the detention decision anew on Thursday morning. Abouammo waved and blew a kiss to his children as he left the courtroom.</p>
      <p>Arrest warrants have been issued for Alzabarah and Almutairi, who are believed to be in Saudi Arabia.</p>
