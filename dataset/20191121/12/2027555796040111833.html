      <h1>Camera bug allows hackers spy on Android phone users</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:07:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/rohit-kvn" target="_blank">Rohit KVN</a></address>
      <p>Security researchers at Checkmarx have uncovered a critical bug in the Android phones' camera app that would leave the users vulnerable to get hacked.</p>
      <p>For several years, the Checkmarx team routinely carries out research studies to detect the vulnerability, particularly related to user privacy security on mobile phones.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, they created a special code to breach the <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/specials/nfc-vulnerability-affects-millions-of-android-phones-773309.html">Google</a> camera app's security and to their astonishment, they succeded in their endeavor. <a href="https://www.checkmarx.com/blog/how-attackers-could-hijack-your-android-camera">Checkmarx researchers</a> were able to access storage, see GPS-tagged photos and even retrieve them without the knowledge of the phone users via C&amp;C (Command &amp; Control) method.</p>

      <p><b>Here are activities Checkmarx experts were able to carry out using C&amp;C:</b><br/>Take a photo on the victim’s phone and upload (retrieve) it to the C&amp;C server<br/>Record a video on the victim’s phone and upload (retrieve) it to the C&amp;C server<br/>Parse all of the latest photos for GPS tags and locate the phone on a global map<br/>Operate in stealth mode whereby the phone is silenced while taking photos and recording videos<br/>Wait for a voice call and automatically record:<br/>Video from the victim’s side<br/>Audio from both sides of the conversation</p>
      <p>The mobile units used for security checkups were Google Pixel 2 XL and Pixel 3. Later they tested on other branded Android phones including Samsung and later it turned out that, they too had similar vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p>Checkmarx developed the PoC (Proof-of-Concept) report and sent it to Google. Taking note of the severity of the issue, the search engine giant carried out its own independent investigation and confirmed the existence of the aforementioned threat not only in its own Google Camera app but also in other Android phones. Even Samsung too has acknowledged the issue.</p>
      <blockquote>"Working directly with Google, they notified our research team and confirmed our suspicion that the vulnerabilities were not specific to the Pixel product line. Google informed our research team that the impact was much greater and extended into the broader Android ecosystem, with additional vendors such as Samsung acknowledging that these flaws also impact their Camera apps, and began taking mitigating steps" Pedro Umbelino, Senior Security Researcher, Checkmarx said</blockquote>
      <p>Google has announced that the software security patch has been forwarded to all the Android OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and they have been asked to roll it out to respective branded devices.</p>
      <p>All Android phone owners are advised to upgrade to the latest security patch at the earliest.</p>
