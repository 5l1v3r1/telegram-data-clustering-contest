      <h1>Norovirus outbreak at Lego show leaves over 40 people ill</h1>

      <p>Dozens of people in the UK have been suffering from norovirus-like symptoms after attending a huge Lego event in Bristol over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The organizers of the Bristol Brick show say they are “devastated” and an investigation has been launched by the city’s health authorities.</p>
      <p>Nearly 4,000 people visited the Action Indoor Sports center to celebrate Lego, but after the event, more than 40 attendees started experiencing sickness and diarrhea.</p>
      <p>One Lego fan, who wished to remain anonymous, said he was not happy with the cleanliness of the venue.</p>
      <p>He said: “The state of the place left a lot to be desired.”</p>
      <p>“The food wasn’t great and over the weekend, the toilets weren’t well maintained, the basins didn’t work well and there was no hand sanitizer and that sort of thing.”</p>
      <p>“At least 40 people that I know about have been affected.”</p>
      <p>The Bristol Brick show issued a post on its Facebook page Wednesday afternoon that said: “Thank you all for coming to our show, enjoying it and helping us to raise money for two very worthy charities.</p>
      <p>“We have been made aware that a number of people who attended our event over the weekend have since been hit by a virus.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately there were no reports of sickness made during the duration of the show, therefore we had no way of warning anyone nor identifying a source at the time.</p>
      <p>“Many of you will know that Bristol has recently seen multiple cases of Norovirus affecting schools, hospitals and other businesses in the area and the combination of that plus almost 4,000 people through our doors over the weekend seems to have contributed to an outbreak.</p>
      <p>“We held the same event at the same venue last year with no known issues so are confident this is an unfortunate and isolated incident.</p>
      <p>“As the organizers, we are devastated that this has put a damper on an otherwise successful show, obviously we wish everyone who is affected a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p>“Thanks for your continued support and we hope your memories of the show are not by tainted by these events!”</p>
