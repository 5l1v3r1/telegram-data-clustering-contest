      <p>PUNE: One day, four events, three gold.</p>
      <p>History is made.</p>
      <p>Indian rifle-pistol shooters dominated the third day of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ISSF-World-Cup-Finals">ISSF World Cup Finals</a> as the Tricolour went up thrice in Putian, China, on Thursday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/manu-bhaker">Manu Bhaker</a> in 10m air pistol, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Elavenil-Valarivan">Elavenil Valarivan</a> and Divyansh Singh Panwar in women’s and men’s 10m air rifle events. Gold medal at the World Cup Finals is significant as toppers of the four World Cups and World rankings get invite to participate in the Finals. This year, it is even more prestigious as most of the participants are qualified to shoot at the 2020 Tokyo Games.</p>
      <p>In a surprise, India missed a medal in men’s 10m air pistol event as Abhishek Verma and Saurabh Verma finished 5th and 6th respectively. Both the shooters have qualified for Tokyo and had won two gold each in the four World Cups this year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Manu creates Junior final World Record</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manu became only second pistol shooter to win gold in 10m air pistol event after Heena Sidhu’s gold in 2013.</p>
      <p>Manu, who missed the 25m pistol final on Wednesday by finishing 10th after her scores, admitted she was nervous throughout the 10m final on Thursday. But the Haryana shooter focused on one shot at a time to win her maiden year-ender medal. Manu, 17, had shot 583 in the qualification round, same as Germany’s Doreen Vennekamp and Australian Elena Galiabovitch. However, Doreen qualified for the final as 8th shooter as she had more number of inner 10s (23) compared to Elena (17) and Manu (17).</p>
      <p>“I missed the 25m final just on lesser inner 10s. I was upset about it. Although I wasn’t thinking about it during today’s final, I was nervous throughout the match. I told myself to shoot freely irrespective of the result. I avoided looking at the scores and focused on one shot at a time, so I guess it helped me,” Manu, who has qualified for the Tokyo Games in 10m air pistol category.</p>
      <p>Manu’s score of 244.7 in the final on Thursday is a new junior world record. She bettered her own record, which she had created recently at the Asian Championships in Doha, by 0.4 point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Elavenil throws her hat in Tokyo ring</b>
      </p>
      <p>Out of the three gold medallists, Elavenil, 21, was the only shooter who has not won a quota for the Tokyo Games. India has two quota places through Apurvi Chandela and Anjum Moudgil. However, both Anjum and Apurvi failed to enter the final on Thursday, finishing 13th and 15th respectively.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Elavenil and young shooter Mehuli Ghosh, who have not won a quota place themselves, entered the final after scoring 631.1 and 629.3 respectively. In the final, Mehuli got eliminated at 6th position (163.8), while it was a dramatic finish for Elavenil.</p>
      <p>The Ahmedabad shooter, who trains at Gagan Narang’s Gun For Glory academy, was leading the pack of 8 shooters in the final, till the 22nd shot (in a 24-shot final). She had a lead of 1.7 points over Taiwan’s Lin Ying-Shin. However, a 9.4 in her 23rd shot reduced Elavenil’s lead to 0.5 point as Lin shot a 10.6. However, Elavenil gained control again and shot a 10.4 in her last round. The Taiwan shooter shot a 10.8 and fell short by 0.1 point to settle for silver. Elavenil’s final score was 250.8, while Lin finished at 250.7.</p>
      <p>This medal will give Elavenil a push in the domestic ranking for the Tokyo Games selection. Since top two shooters in the ranking will have a chance to use the two quotas, it will be an interesting contest before Tokyo in the women’s 10m air rifle category.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Panwar follows Ela’s path</b>
      </p>
      <p>Divyansh Singh Panwar, who has a Tokyo quota already, followed Elavenil’s path in the final. Like his teammate, Divyansh was leading the final by 0.7 point over Hungary’s Istvan Peni till the 22nd shot.</p>
      <p>He hit a 9.8 in his 23rd shot , while Peni hit a 10 to reduce the gap to only 0.5 point ahead of the last shot. In the last shot, the Indian shot 10.1 to take the final score to 250.1, while Peni shot a 10.5 to reach 250. The 0.1 lead was good enough for Divyansh to win his maiden World Cup Finals medal.</p>
      <p><b>Results: </b>Men's 10m air rifle: Divyansh Panwar 250.1, Istvan Peni (Hungary) 250, Patrik Jany (Slovakia) 228.4; Women's 10m air rifle: Elavenil 250.8, Lin Ying-Shin (Taiwan) 250.7, Coman Laura-Georgeta (Romania) 229; Women's 10m air pistol: Manu Bhaker 244.7 (WRJ), Zorana Arunovic (Serbia) 241.9, Wang Qian (China) 221.8.</p>
