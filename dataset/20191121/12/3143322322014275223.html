      <p>The controversial National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme has drawn criticism from a number of quarters. The South African Institute of Race Relations (IRR) have joined the fray in a statement which calls on South Africans to make sure their voices are heard before the NHI Bill is passed.</p>
      <p>The IRR have started a ten-day countdown (starting today) to urge South Africans opposing the passing of the Bill to comment before the November 29 deadline.</p>

      <p>“On November 29, public comment on the ANC’s disastrous National Health Insurance scheme closes. This scheme will see the end of healthcare in South Africa as we know it. The NHI will make an Eskom out of the healthcare of all South Africans,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>It goes on to explain that the country faces numerous challenges with regards to healthcare and access to healthcare with millions of South Africans exposed to poor health services provided by the State.</p>

        <i> “Yet the State has used mountains of regulations to make market-based solutions to our healthcare crisis impossible.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Instead of heeding the shocking failure of NHI pilot projects, and improving state-run healthcare for those left to face the consequences of the ANC’s disastrous economic policy, the government is determined to manage the healthcare of ordinary hard-working South Africans as it is managing Eskom.”</i>

      <p>The statement continued to liken government management of Eskom and the accompanying load-shedding to its management of NHI which they believe would lead to “life-shedding”.</p>
      <p>The IRR today sent this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l69toTxSkuk&amp;t=1s">video</a> to South Africans to garner support and to raise awareness that South Africans still have time to comment on the Bill.</p>
      <p>“As always, South Africans will step up to save the country from the failures inflicted on it by politicians. Together we can stop the NHI – we must,” said IRR campaigns coordinator, Hermann Pretorius.</p>
