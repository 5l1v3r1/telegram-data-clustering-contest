      <h3>Safe consumption site</h3>
      <p>Re: <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/saskatchewans-first-safe-consumption-site-aims-to-foster-community">Saskatoon’s first safe consumption site set to open — once funding arrives</a> (SP, Nov. 5)</p>
      <p>So now Saskatoon is the proud possessor of what AIDS Saskatoon has quaintly named a “consumption site” — you know, a safe-injection site where users can shoot up some good fentanyl, have a relaxing toke-smoke, and enjoy the presence of some comfortable couches that are so thoughtfully being supplied for them.</p>
      <p>Apparently, two paramedics will be available 24/7 to administer Naloxone, should any patrons experience an opioid overdose.</p>
      <p>The advocates for the facility have even had “a local artist” paint a pleasing mural on the walls so as to discourage the patrons from graffiti-ing the walls.</p>
      <p>And the cost for this site, located in what already is a high-crime area? Only $1.1 million … if the Saskatchewan Health Authority comes through with that amount. Besides, the city’s police chief is calling for the hiring of seven or eight new officers, in anticipation of increased crime near the site. The cost for that? $800,000.</p>
      <p>If it were my call, I’d be more inclined to build a facility where users could be cold-turkeyed off their habit. That or nothing. Call it tough love.</p>
      <p>Would such a facility not be better than accommodating the 250 expected clients like visitors to a health spa somewhere?</p>

        <b>We are all stronger together</b>
      </p>
      <p>I appreciated Rob Vanstone’s article, “<a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-show-that-nice-guys-can-finish-first/wcm/74c4076f-21b4-40dd-9a74-c8e1930f1f80">Roughriders able to show that nice guys can finish first</a>” (SP, Nov. 6). I liked it as a longtime Roughrider fan but more importantly because it illustrates how we are all stronger when we have a common goal and work together.</p>
      <p>I hold this example up as a strong contrast to what is happening to us as a Canadian society. I am deeply troubled that there are some among us who appear to be willing to “cut off their noses to spite their faces.” The “Wexit movement” seems to be willing to suffer irreparable losses in a foolhardy attempt to bring suffering to fellow Canadians because they feel left out or unappreciated.</p>
      <p>This whole situation is far too complex for me to try and support my position with a rudimentary analysis by an 82-year-old citizen. Instead, just think about what would happen if members of the Roughriders were arguing among themselves about why someone gets more money than they do. Or why some get more publicity? If one or more players decided they wouldn’t give their best effort unless and until they got more money, better bonuses or whatever.</p>
      <p>Our situation is serious, the problems are real and complex and rooted in a historical context. Nevertheless, we are stronger together. Just ask the Riders.</p>
