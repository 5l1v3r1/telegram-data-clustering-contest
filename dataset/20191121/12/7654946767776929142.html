      <h1>Prince Andrew didn’t step back from royal duties – Queen Elizabeth ‘fired’ him</h1>

      <p>Prince Andrew didn’t <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/prince-andrew-to-step-back-from-public-duties-in-wake-of-epstein-interview/">step down from royal duties</a> — he was fired by his mom, Queen Elizabeth II, according to reports in the UK.</p>
      <p>“The Queen summoned the Duke to Buckingham Palace to tell him her decision,” one of Andrew’s friends <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10389442/queen-prince-andrew-royal-duties/">told the Sun</a> of the Duke of York’s downfall that royal experts have called “monumental.”</p>
      <p>“It was a devastating moment for both of them. His reputation is in tatters,” the source said, referring to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/devine-no-honor-in-prince-andrews-self-pity-over-epstein-friendship/">overwhelming backlash from his BBC interview</a> discussing his ties to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>“It is unlikely he will ever perform royal duties again. He is disgraced,” the source told the paper.</p>
      <p>Both the Daily Mail and Metro UK newspapers <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyMailUK/status/1197280902847614979">said on their front pages Thursda</a>y that Andrew had been “banned” from further duties, with the Mail saying he was “forced” into Wednesday’s announcement.</p>
      <p>Prince Charles, who is next in line to the throne, was also at the heart of the decision, acting “decisively” after watching the escalating scandal with “increasing alarm,” a senior figure <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sack-andrew-to-save-the-monarchy-how-charles-advised-queen-over-brother-s-fate-a4292781.html">told the Evening Standard.</a></p>
      <p>“This is not about personalities but about safeguarding the future of the institution of the monarchy itself,” the source told the paper.</p>
      <p>“There could be only one conclusion… The Duke of York had to withdraw from the fray and from public life.</p>
      <p>“It is very sad. Obviously, both the Queen and the prince love Andrew … but the health of the monarchy is too important to risk.”</p>
      <p>Charles, who was in New Zealand, was “very involved in the decision as heir to the throne,” a senior palace source also told The Sun.<br/>“He knew action had to be taken. The Duke knew he couldn’t fight any more. His royal career is over.”</p>
      <p>The source also admitted that the 93-year-old monarch was “privately very disappointed” with Andrew, according to the Sun.</p>

      <p>“She has spent her whole life protecting the monarchy and in just one week her son’s actions threatened to tear it apart,” the source said.</p>
      <p>“Something had to be done to draw a line under all of this.”</p>
      <p>Andrew will no longer receive his $323,000 Sovereign Grant allowance but will still receive his income from the Queen’s private funds, the paper noted.</p>
      <p>However, sources stressed that Andrew “remains a member of the royal family” even though he will not carry out public duties.</p>
      <p>“He will still appear during Trooping the Color and on the balcony at major events,” a source told the paper.</p>
      <p>Royal biographer Robert Lacey <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/e07e49b0-0bd2-11ea-96a6-b8ef146759ed">told the Times of London</a> that it was a “monumental” moment in royal history.</p>
      <p>“Nothing like this has happened in the Queen’s long reign,” he said.</p>

      <p>Royal author Penny Junor also believes the Queen must be “horrified.”</p>
      <p>“This is absolutely unprecedented that a fairly senior member of the royal family should be forced to retire from public life,” she told the Sun.</p>
