      <h1>Former Erwin Hymer plant bought by Conestoga College</h1>
      <h2>The building will be used to consolidate the skilled trades program</h2>

      <p>Conestoga College has made a big purchase as the institution works to expand its campus. </p>
      <p>President John Tibbits announced the purchase of one of the former Erwin Hymer plants in Cambridge this week. </p>
      <p>The plan is to use the building for the skilled trades program. </p>
      <p>"It will allow us to consolidate, we can bring the trades from Waterloo, Guelph, Kitchener and the Cambridge 401 campus and we can put them there so there will be synergy," said Tibbits. </p>
      <p>The 250,000 square foot facility sits on over 40 acres of land, which leaves room for any further expansion. </p>
      <p>"We have been trying to find a building for some time, and it allows us to accomplish our objective of putting all the trades in one area and giving it the exposure that it doesn't have." </p>
      <p>Tibbits said the location is also a benefit. "There is easy access off the 401, which means that we can draw from a wide area geographically."</p>
      <p>"We are excited, its a big step for us," he said. </p>
      <p>The goal is to have classes running out of the new building by September of 2021. </p>
