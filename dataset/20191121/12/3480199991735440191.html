      <p>Porsche has added a new Taycan 4S to its line-up of electric sports cars.</p>
      <p>Designed to sit underneath both the Turbo and Turbo S models in terms of outright performance, the new 4S manages to eclipse both of those cars for all-electric range.</p>
      <p>Porsche claims that a smaller battery version will return 252 miles on a single charge from its 79.2kWh battery, though a larger 93.4kWh battery will unlock 287 miles of range – the longest of any car in the Taycan range.</p>

      <p>It uses the same dual-motor drivetrain setup as the Turbo-badged vehicles but pushes out less power – 523bhp – because of a less potent rear motor. Even so, Porsche claims that the 4S will go from 0-60mph in under four seconds and hit a limited top speed of 155mph.</p>
      <p>The more dynamic exterior design showcased on the Turbo models has been cooled down, with the front and rear splitters less aggressive than before. New 19-inch alloy wheels complete the package, too.</p>

      <p>It also benefits from Porsche’s 4D chassis control and adaptive air suspension as standard, along with PASM electronic damper control.</p>
      <p>The new Taycan 4S is available to order now priced from £83,367 prior to any UK electric car grant being applied.</p>
