      <p>Grabbing a bargain on a big TV or that Lego set you've been eyeing for a while can be exhilarating. But that feeling will end eventually. Even if you don't notice it happening you'll eventually get used to the thing you bought and that will be it.</p>
      <p>But what if you get a Black Friday bargain keeps that feeling going? You may well find it at LoveHoney<a href="https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/black-friday/">.

They <a href="https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/black-friday/sexy-lingerie-deals/">also sell lingerie,</a> <a href="https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/black-friday/bondage-toy-deals/">various kinky bits of equipment</a>, lube and other products to improve the sex you have, and even adult-themed board games. No seriously, <a href="https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/sex/better-sex-for-couples/sexy-fun-games/">Lovehoney sells board and card games.</a></p>
      <p>They also <a href="https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/sex/condoms/">sell condoms</a>, which you might need to avoid a Black Friday-induced fun turning into 18 years of money spent raising another person.</p>
