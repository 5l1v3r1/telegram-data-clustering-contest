      <h1>I Tried Getting Up 1 Hour Early Every Day For a Week — Here's What Happened</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:50:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author">Nicole Yi</a></address>
      <p>Hi, my name is Nicole Yi and I am not <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/How-Become-Morning-Person-26607205">a morning person</a> — at all. My friends and family know not to disturb me before a certain hour for fear that I will turn into the Demogorgon, and I <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Things-Sleep-Lovers-Can-Relate-41011057">cherish every single minute of my sleep</a>. I've gotten a lot better as an adult, but I was known to hibernate in high school and college, sometimes waking up the following day around dinner time. I'm surprised more people weren't concerned, now that I think about it.</p>
      <p>Obviously, since becoming a working professional after school, I've had to get rid of my habits. I've always envied my colleagues who have enough self-discipline to work out before coming into the office, or who are able to wake up early to get a calm start to their day. My mornings consist of snoozing, some more snoozing, and rushing out the door. So I decided — and immediately regretted — to try waking up an hour early each work day for a week to see if one, I could do it, and two, if it would be as life-changing as I predicted. Here's what happened:</p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p>My 6:30 a.m. alarm went off and I thought, "Not bad! I can do this." I took an intense cycling class and felt surprisingly great afterwards as I was getting ready to go to work. Around 11 a.m. though, I definitely needed <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Does-Coffee-Have-Health-Benefits-44327351">another cup of coffee</a>. And then another one around 2:00 p.m.</p>
      <h3>Tuesday</h3>
      <p>My 6:30 a.m. alarm sounded especially horrific this morning as I was in and out of sleep all night from a damn mosquito buzzing around my ear. (Don't worry, I got my vengeance later.) I had plans of going on <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Naps-Good-You-40387042">a morning run</a> and then grabbing coffee at my favorite cafe, but none of that happened because I went back to bed. It was day two and I had already failed. I started feeling hungover from the previous day's early start around the afternoon, and I was desperate for a nap.</p>
      <h3>Wednesday</h3>
      <p>If it wasn't for the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Barre-Workouts">barre class</a> I had already booked and paid for, I would've had another Tuesday repeat. I was successful in getting myself out of bed at 6:30 this time, but I was falling asleep during the class. I didn't feel too bad while getting ready afterwards but needed that extra coffee again throughout the day.</p>
      <h3>Thursday</h3>
      <p>It was pretty terrible waking up, but I decided to use my extra hour for making the most of the morning inside my apartment. I took my time getting ready, checked my emails, and I even got breakfast. I arrived to work earlier than usual and it felt great not scrambling.</p>
      <h3>Friday</h3>
      <p>It was a long internal battle before I finally settled on staying in bed. Yes, I failed again.</p>
      <p>By the end of the experimental week, I learned that I had no self-discipline whatsoever, which was disappointing because I honestly thought I was a little better than that. What's even more disappointing is that I woke up at 2:00 a.m. (yes, you read that correctly) for a whole Summer during college for a news station internship, and I wasn't even able to get myself out of bed at an hour when most people wake up daily.</p>
      <p>The most effective way to maintain an early schedule was to book <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Get-Yourself-Work-Out-Reguarly-42312443">fitness classes to hold myself accountable</a>. Without them, it allowed too much room to decide "no." But I did love that I was able to cross off working out on my list before my day had even really started. Even if you don't feel like exercising before work, an alternative to a workout buddy is a coffee buddy. If I ever try this again, I'll make plans with a co-worker to grab coffee at a nearby cafe before getting into the office. That way, we can both check our emails without feeling guilty and have a relaxed start to our days.</p>
      <p>As much as I love the idea of being a morning person, sadly, it's just not who I am. I prefer to take back my hour of sleep and continue finishing things up into the evening rather than the reverse. Maybe I'll give it a go another time.</p>
