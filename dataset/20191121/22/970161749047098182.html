      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> is coming back with a bang – perhaps the biggest bang the series has ever seen.</p>
      <p>Jodie Whittaker is returning in early 2020 for her second series as the Thirteenth Doctor, with Mandip Gill, Tosin Cole and Bradley Walsh also back as companions Yaz, Ryan and Graham.</p>
      <p>And while it’s been a whole year since Doctor Who last appeared on our screens, the team has been cooking up something pretty spectacular for its return.</p>
      <p>Showrunner Chris Chibnall has revealed that the first episode of series 12 of Doctor Who could be the biggest the show has ever done… and considering there’s been over 1,000 episodes since the first series back in 1963 and 287 since 2005, that’s pretty impressive.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk at BBC Studios in Cardiff, Chibnall said of their comeback episode: ‘It’s big. It’s the biggest episode we’ve done, and it might be the biggest episode the show has done. Lots of action, a lot of fun.</p>

      <p>‘It’s a big, action-packed hoot.’</p>

      <p>‘It was immediately very high energy,’ added Jodie – although the team remained tight-lipped on what exactly the episode contains. However, we can expect the series to ‘level up’ from Thirteen’s impressive debut in 2018.</p>
      <p>‘We are on a journey with this Doctor and these characters so we want to do big, emotional, action-packed, scary, funny stories and we want to go up a level from last year,’ Chibnall explained.</p>
      <p>‘Last year was a recruitment year for the show, for the Doctor, getting everybody in. It’s always a stepping on point with a new Doctor, and also bringing that existing audience as well. This year, we’re saying to those people – “OK, here is the amazing world of Doctor Who, here’s lots of treats, here’s lots of new stuff, some old stuff, let’s see what you make of this”. But also for ourselves, the ambition is go up a level. And I think we’ve done that.’</p>
      <p>‘It all comes down to the writing, so all the hard work is done for me and us in that sense because essentially we are given these gems of characters on the page,’ said Jodie.</p>

      <p>‘Having had an entire season to discover all these different avenues you can go down, and knowing that playing someone like the Doctor means you’re not restricted in any way, some of these episodes I’d say go in a direction that is different for the Doctor from the previous season. So that in itself shows a level or a side to her that we haven’t seen yet.’</p>

      <p>But what side will that be? ‘I won’t be allowed to say,’ laughed the Yorkshire actress before nudging Chris: ‘Oh, you’ll have to answer that.’</p>
      <p>‘We’re delving deeper into the Thirteeenth Doctor this year,’ he mused. ‘That’s all I’m saying. You’ll see things you didn’t see last year within facets of the Doctor.’</p>
      <p>While the Doctor Who squad are keeping their lips sealed on whether the Thirteenth Doctor will have a personality transplant this season, we do know a thing or two about the monsters she’ll be facing. Among the old monsters returning for the new series are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/21/doctor-who-enemies-the-judoon-confirmed-to-return-and-face-off-against-jodie-whittaker-in-new-series-9636009/">the Intergalactic Police, the Judoon</a>… and, Chris helpfully teases, some ‘other ones’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘This year it’s like, look at everything we’ve got in the toybox of Doctor Who. It was always the plan to have more old monsters. There’s a lovely balance, we’ve got some quite scary new monsters, because you want the people, whether they’re five or 25 or 55 who joined us last year and hadn’t watched the show before, to show them all the treats Doctor Who can provide.’</p>

      <p>‘I don’t think it’s darker. I think we’ve got some amazing monsters. It’s probably a bit scarier,’ Chris said.</p>
      <p>‘The thing is with Doctor Who, you’ve got to hit all the notes… we’ve got bigger action set pieces, we’ve got some old monsters coming back, some really brilliant new monsters, and there’s a little thread trickling through. So you know, it’s not the same, we’re developing the story of the Thirteenth Doctor and this gang.’</p>
