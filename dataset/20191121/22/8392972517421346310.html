      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> have branded Jacqueline Jossa and Nadine Coyle "snakes" for refusing to participate in a challenge.</p>
      <p>The campmates had to pick two stars to join newbies <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-viewers-already-convinced-andy-whyment-will-win/">Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi as Outlaws in the Jungle Jailhouse</a>.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway read out a message in camp which said: "Outlaws caught wanted for their crime of late entry.  The two new campmates Andy and Cliff have been sent to Jungle Jailhouse on basic rations.</p>

      <p>"Before entering the Jailhouse they took part in today’s Bushtucker Trial – The Frontier of Fear and they won 8 stars for camp.</p>
      <p>"You now have the opportunity to be good, bad or downright ugly.</p>
      <p>"So we can keep all the food ourselves, or we can choose to feed the outlaws with our share of food, however if we choose to feed them we will have to send two campmates to join them as outlaws in the Jailhouse."</p>
      <p>Andrew Maxwell and James Haskell said they were both happy to go as well as Kate and Ian Wright.</p>

      <p>Former footballer Ian then suggested they draw straws.</p>
      <p>Referring to drawing names, Jacqueline said: "I think that's scary."</p>
      <p>When Ian said she didn't have to go, Jacqueline said: "Yeah but it’s not very heroic," to which Andrew said: "I don't think it's fair to count yourself out, I think the ordeal has to be shared."</p>
      <p>James Haskell hit back: "If she doesn’t want to do it, she doesn't have to do it."</p>
      <p>Tensions began to rise as Jacqueline and Nadine Coyle admitted they didn't want to take part and would prefer to stay in camp.</p>

      <p>Speaking in the Bush Telegraph, Andrew said: "Jacqueline and Nadine said they didn’t want to go and that’s the end of that."</p>
      <p>The campmates then picked named water bottles out of a bag and the last two remaining were the two to go to the Jailhouse – they were Kate and Andrew.</p>
      <p>Kate and Andrew left camp to join Andy and Cliff at the Jungle Jailhouse.</p>
      <aside>Don’t think Jacqueline and Nadine refusing is gonna do them any good is it.</aside>
      <p>Viewers weren't impressed with Jacqueline and Nadine for refusing to put their names in the bag.</p>
      <p>One person said: "Don’t think Jacqueline and Nadine refusing is gonna do them any good is it one of them is gonna get voted."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Just used all my votes for Jaqueline &amp; Nadine. You go on this show to take part not spit your dummies out and refuse to be apart of the experience."</p>

      <p>A third added: "Jacqueline and Nadine are both Snakes, you never ever pull out of an challenge because you are scared, imagine going to war to say nah can’t be bothered as I’m scared, you go because you always help others on your side it’s an bond! One goes you all Go!"</p>
