      <h1>Did Elon Musk just confirm the design of the Tesla Cybertruck?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:39:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>Tesla is announcing their new truck today at 11 PM ET (4 AM UK time), finally ending the mystery of the design of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>There are still a few hours of speculation left, however, and Elon Musk loves nothing more than to tease us.</p>
      <p>In his latest tweet he notes:</p>

      <p>While this may not appear to reveal much, there has been speculation that Musk has been hiding the design of the Cybertruck in plain sight, in a render of Elon’s Mars base published some time ago.</p>

      <p>In the foreground of the base we can see some kind of vehicle, which looks like this when zoomed in:</p>

      <p>Musk had earlier said the truck will look like an <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/elon-musk-says-their-long-awaited-electric-truck-will-look-like-an-armored-personnel-carrier-from-the-future/">“<i>armoured personnel carrier from the future”</i></a> and the vehicle pictures certainly fits the bill.</p>
      <p>Tesla also tweeted this video, which shows the profile of the vehicle, which matches the Mars truck above.</p>

      <p>In another <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1197638937109336066">tweet</a>, he said “Cybertruck design influenced partly by The Spy Who Loved Me,” tweeting a video of James Bond’s amphibious car with its iconic angular design.</p>

      <p>Of course, such a design will probably have very few fans, but Musk had said: “<i>if there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future.</i>”</p>
      <p>Telsa has confirmed that the truck will be called “CYBRTRK”, following<a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4806:dji1m3.2.2"> a trademark filed by Tesla</a> on the 6th November being discovered. CYBRTRK.com redirects to Tesla.com at present.</p>

      <p>He has also said it will feature a 400-500 mile range, dual-motor all-wheel-drive drive train and dynamic suspension, and “300,000 lbs of towing capacity,” and will cost less than $50,000 and “be better than a Ford F150.”</p>
      <p>Musk promised their truck would be “a better sports car than a standard Porsche 911”, as well as a “better truck than a Ford F-150 in terms of truck-like functionality.”</p>
      <p>The Tesla Cybertruck Launch will be in Los Angeles near the SpaceX rocket factory, and the event will be live-streamed. Keep an eye on the site for news on the full reveal.</p>
