        <li>Teala Davies sues disgraced financier’s estate</li>
        <li>About a dozen women have brought accusations of sexual abuse</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A woman who says she suffered lasting damage from sexual abuse by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> when she was 17 years old has sued his estate, joining the growing list of women who have sued the late disgraced financier.</p>
      <p>Teala Davies filed her lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Thursday and appeared at a news conference with attorney <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gloria-allred">Gloria Allred</a>.</p>
      <p>In the news conference she called herself “the perfect victim” for a predator who took advantage of vulnerable underage teenagers and young women. Allred said her client had a difficult childhood that included being homeless for a year at age 11.</p>
      <p>According to the lawsuit, Davies was raped and sexually abused by Epstein at his residences in New York, Paris, Florida, New Mexico and the US Virgin Islands.</p>
      <p>“It took me a long time to break free from his mind control and abuse,” Davies said in her statement. “I still have flashbacks. It still hurts.”</p>
      <p>She said she was speaking publicly to set an example and inspire all victims of sexual abuse to conquer their fear and tell someone.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Davies becomes one of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/jeffrey-epstein-estate-victim-compensation">about a dozen women</a> suing the late financier’s estate for alleged sexual abuses.</p>

      <p>“I’m still a victim because I am fearful for my daughters and everyone’s daughters. I’m fearful for their future in this world, where there are predators in power, a world where people can avoid justice if their pockets run deep enough,” Davies said at the hearing.</p>
      <p>Epstein killed himself in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. A message was left seeking comment from a lawyer for his estate.</p>
      <p>The Davies lawsuit was filed a day after another woman anonymously sued in Manhattan federal court against Epstein’s estate, alleging that she was manipulated and sexually assaulted by Epstein at the age of 16.</p>
      <p>The woman said in the lawsuit that she came to the United States as a young child with her parents from a war-torn region of the world. The lawsuit said she was living in New York and enjoying success as a model with numerous spreads in major fashion magazines when she met Epstein in 2004.</p>
      <p>The abuse over more than a year led her to quit modeling and feel humiliated, angry and suicidal, the lawsuit said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, another woman who identifies herself as “Jane Doe 15”, claimed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-charges-court">Epstein</a> committed a “vicious, prolonged sexual assault” against her when she was 15, and urged Prince Andrew to come forward with any relevant information about the convicted sex offender.</p>
      <p>The woman appealed to the Duke of York at a press conference on Monday, where she and Allred announced her lawsuit against Epstein’s estate.</p>
