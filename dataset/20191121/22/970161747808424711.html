      <p>The government has begun the process of bringing British orphans whose parents died in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/syria/">Syria</a> back to the UK.</p>
      <p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has confirmed that a group of three British orphans will be returning to the UK from territory which was formerly under the control of Islamic state (Isis).</p>
      <p>Dr Abdulkarim Omar, the co-chair of the foreign relations commission in north Syria tweeted yesterday that the children had been ‘handed over to a delegation representing the British foreign ministry’.</p>
      <p>He posted a photo of himself with Martin Longden, the UK’s special representative for Syria, and added that the ‘three British orphans were from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/islamic-state-isis/">ISIS</a> parents’.</p>
      <p>The government had previously said it would not be allowing British citizens trapped in Isis territory to return.</p>
      <p>However, Dominic Raab last month told MPs that as long as there was ‘no security threat’, children rescued from the fighting in northern Syria could be allowed to return home.</p>

      <p>Mr Raab said last night: ‘These innocent, orphaned, children should never have been subjected to the horrors of war.</p>

      <p>‘We have facilitated their return home because it was the right thing to do. Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life.’</p>
      <p>Save the Children has estimated at least 60 British children are trapped in northern Syria in ‘dire conditions’, with many under five years old.</p>
      <p>Last week, it was reported home secretary Priti Patel and other ministers blocked a rescue operation in October to bring some home over ‘security concerns’.</p>
