      <p>The food ministry they said they're blessed to have the support of the county to make this happen for their neighbors.</p>

      <p>"I barely get enough money, I draw social security, I barely draw enough to pay my bills, household bills. So I don't have much money to buy groceries with," David Ogle, who was getting a bag for a holiday meal.</p>
