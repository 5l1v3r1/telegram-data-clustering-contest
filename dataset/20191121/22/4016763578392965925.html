      <p>Fresh off a Latin Grammy win for <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Bad-bunny/X-100pre"><i>X 100PRE</i></a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Bad-bunny">Bad Bunny</a> dropped a new single titled <a href="https://genius.com/Bad-bunny-vete-lyrics">“Vete.”</a> It is produced by his previous collaborator <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Subeloneo">Subelo NEO</a>, who is also known for working with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Lunay">Lunay</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Farruko">Farruko</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Eladio-carrion">Eladio Carrión</a>.</p>
      <p>The intro contains an interpolation of <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Noriega">Noriega</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Kartier-pr">Kartier</a>’s classic song, <a href="https://genius.com/Noriega-si-te-vas-lyrics">“Si Te Vas,”</a> as Genius contributor <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Javy-bell">Javy Bell</a> breaks down in an annotation:</p>
      <p>On the track, Bad Bunny tells off an ex:</p>
      <blockquote>En mi corazón ya tú no ere' la que manda<br/>Se acabó, por ti ya no siento nada<br/>De nuestra serie ya no salen temporada'<br/>Así que vete lejo', dile al diablo que te envíe el pin<br/>Hace tiempo que no somo' un team<br/>Pa'l carajo nuestro aniversario y San Valentín</blockquote>
