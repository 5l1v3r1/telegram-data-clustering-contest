      <h1>RB Leipzig chief drops Erling Braut Haaland hint amid rumours of cut-price transfer</h1>
      <h2>Erling Braut Haaland could snub Man Utd, Liverpool and Arsenal in order to make a move to RB Leipzig, with the German club seemingly keen on a cut-price transfer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:33:05+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>RB Leipzig sporting director Markus Krosche has hinted he is interested in signing Erling Braut Haaland after reports they could complete a cut-price deal.</p>
      <p>Haaland is wanted by top clubs across Europe after his stunning form for Red Bull Salzburg.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are said to have been quoted a £75million fee to land Haaland, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer keen to push for a move.</p>
      <p>But Salzburg share the same owners as RB Leipzig, with reports in Germany claiming they will be offered the chance to sign him for just £25.7m.</p>
      <p>His father, Alf-Inge Haaland, who is said to have visited <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and Manchester United's training grounds in recent weeks, is also believed to have advised him to head to the Bundesliga before a Premier League move.</p>

      <p>Krosche has now broken his silence on his admiration for the 19-year-old, who has caught the eye with 26 goals in all competitions this term.</p>
      <p>"The boy is a very good player," he told German outlet <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/bundesliga/vereine/rb-leipzig/erling-haaland-red-bull-salzburg-poker-transfer-66134768.sport.html"><i>Bild</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p>"Both in the league and in the Champions League, he does an exceptionally good job. Of course, we are already looking around for the summer."</p>

      <p>History certainly suggests Haaland could make the move from Salzburg to Leipzig.</p>
      <p>The shared ownership between the two clubs means 17 players have already made the same switch, including <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> star Naby Keita.</p>
      <p>But Sadio Mane jumped straight from Salzburg to the Premier League with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> before joining Liverpool in 2016.</p>

      <p>In a recent interview with talkSPORT about the future of his son, former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , Nottingham Forest and Leeds United ace Alf-Inge Haaland said: “At one stage he would like to play in the Premier League, but when that will happen, I don’t know. It is a very tough league.</p>
      <p>“Up to now he is ahead of the stage we thought he would be at. He is built for the Premier League, but whether that will happen now or at a later stage, we don’t know.</p>
      <p>“He is at Red Bull, a fantastic club playing Champions League so in a way he is in no hurry.</p>
      <p>“Red Bull have shown from the past that they are a ‘middle step’ club, and if they are going to recruit players in the future they can’t put a stupid price tag on the players because nobody would want to go there.”</p>
