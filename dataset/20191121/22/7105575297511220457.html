      <h1>Chris Hemsworth's Wife Elsa Pataky Said Liam "Deserves Much Better" Than Miley Cyrus</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:25:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Liam Hemsworth hasn't said anything about Miley Cyrus since he released <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28685173/liam-hemsworth-statement-miley-cyrus-separation/">a statement confirming</a> their separation. His last silent statement was <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29696761/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-instagram-unfollow/">unfollowing her </a>on Instagram last month. But his sister-in-law Elsa Pataky is willing to talk a little about the breakup, its effect on Liam, and what she thinks of Miley now—at least as a potential partner for Liam.</p>
      <p>In a new interview with <i><a href="https://us.hola.com/celebrities/2019112130208/chris-hemsworth-elsa-pataky-liam-miley-cyrus-breakup/">Hola!</a></i>, Elsa, who's married to Liam's older brother Chris Hemsworth, said that Liam has been spending a lot of time with them. “My brother-in-law, well… After a relationship that you've dedicated ten years to, he's a little bit down, but he's coping well, he’s a strong boy and he deserves the best, I think he deserves much better,” she said. “You always find support in your family, and he's joined at the hip with his brother, who has been there to give all the strength he needed."</p>
      <p>Elsa and Miley were close when she was dating Liam. The two women got <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3567525/Miley-Cyrus-Elsa-Pataky-cement-friendship-love-Hemsworth-brothers-matching-tattoos.html">matching tattoos </a>in 2016.</p>

      <p>Last January, Elsa had glowing things to say about Miley during an interview with <a href="https://www.etonline.com/elsa-pataky-says-her-kids-love-miley-cyrus-talks-matching-tattoo-matt-damons-wife-exclusive-94428"><i>Entertainment Tonight</i></a>. She adored spending time with Miley, and so did her kids. "We love it because she's just so creative," Elsa said. "So any moment, on any circumstance, she actually just writes a song, so we love her and having her around is fun. [We'll say], 'Just sing us something,' and she does."</p>
      <p>"She's amazing and my kids love her, and she has an amazing voice," Elsa said.</p>
