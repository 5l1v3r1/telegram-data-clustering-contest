      <p>Tim Tebow shared a heartbreaking tribute to his dog, Bronco, who he had to put down Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>"One of the toughest goodbyes," Tebow posted to Instagram. "Wanted to make a special tribute to the sweetest boy ever — thank you for all the joy you brought and all the memories. ... If you had the pleasure of meeting Bronco, one of the best dogs ever, I would love to hear your story."</p>

      <p>The dog is aRhodesian Ridgeback and is named after the the Denver Broncos., the team that selectedTebow in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft.</p>
      <p>"It made sense when I just got drafted by the Broncos," <a href="https://www.aol.com/article/news/2018/02/07/through-multiple-teams-and-sports-tim-tebows-dog-bronco-is-always-by-his-side/23355719/">Tebow told AOL Sports in 2018</a>. "We've always liked the name, we always liked that truck, so we talked about it and we were like, yeah, that's really cool."</p>
      <p>Tebow said in his book, "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mao7-R8cRBkC&amp;pg=PT153&amp;lpg=PT153&amp;dq=tim+tebow+dog+birthday+present&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jneSgx5dW8&amp;sig=ACfU3U1u2wXnPMp0U2f1D3FWQ-IUBKQrTA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5mIW01vvlAhWHtVkKHUnbDKgQ6AEwEnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20tebow%20dog%20birthday%20present&amp;f=false">Through My Eyes</a>," Bronco was gifted to him by his brother Robby for his birthday. Tebow said it was his favorite birthday gift ever.</p>

      <p>In 2006, Tebow caused some controversy among dogenthusiasts when he <a href="https://www.newsday.com/sports/football/jets/tim-tebow-s-dog-a-bronx-tail-1.3711818">changed Bronco's name to Bronx</a>. The name change was a result of him playing for the New York Jets. The name was kind of similar as they both start with "Bron" and Tebow even said the dog still responded when he was called.</p>
      <p>Tebow calls the dog Bronco in his goodbye post, so it appears he changed the dog's name back at some point.</p>
      <p>While speaking with AOL, Tebow shared his love for the animal:“For so many people, [dogs] are our best friends and they provide so much joy and love.”</p>
