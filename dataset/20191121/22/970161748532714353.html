      <h1>Martin Keown sends message to Unai Emery over Lucas Torreira's future</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> legend Martin Keown has urged <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> to make Lucas Torreira a regular after warning the Spaniard that his treatment of the Uruguayan has alienated supporters.</p>
      <p>Torreira has been heavily linked with an exit from the Emirates in the January transfer window and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/arsenal-need-focussed-lucas-torreira-discusses-future-amid-rumours-wants-leave-11193243/">refused to commit his future to the club</a> during an interview this week.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has started just four <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> matches this term and has been substituted during every appearance.</p>
      <p>Even when Torreira has played, the defensive midfielder has been used in a more advanced position and his agent recently revealed he was unhappy with his role in the side.</p>

      <p>Keown believes the most important thing is for Torreira to play and the former Arsenal defender believes Emery’s treatment of the midfielder in comparison to ex-club captain Granit Xhaka has left fans disgruntled.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘You have to respect the manager,’ Keown told <i>Metro.co.uk</i> at Sportsmail’s ‘A Pint with Piers’ event in London.</p>
      <p>‘Frank Lampard has taken over at Chelsea, it doesn’t look like their midfield has changed too much from when Maurizio Sarri came in. Frank was a great midfielder himself but he hasn’t tweaked it that much.</p>
      <p>‘[But] Torreira has not been playing full stop. I’d like to see him in the Arsenal midfield. Whether you play him as a deep-lying midfielder or you play him wide or with someone else sitting deeper or two either side…it doesn’t matter as long as he is in the team. He hasn’t played enough for me.</p>
      <p>‘I would have thought it would have been very obvious that he has to play. He’s tenacious. The Chelsea game at home, the Liverpool game at home last season, he was playing in that team and Arsenal looked better for it.</p>
      <p>‘This is why I think the fans went against Emery because Xhaka played no matter what when Torreira had to sit on the bench. Ceballos plays one game for Arsenal [against Burnley] and was absolutely brilliant but he’s back on the bench. Maybe it’s Xhaka he needs to take out.’</p>

      <p>Tottenham used the international break to sack Mauricio Pochettino and the club had appointed Jose Mourinho within 24 hours of the Argentine’s departure.</p>
      <p>Emery had arguably endured more pressure than Pochettino this term but the Spaniard remains at the helm.</p>

      <p>Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi publicly backed Emery earlier this month but Keown believes the message was ‘laced’ and Emery knows anything but qualification for the Champions League will cost him his job.</p>
      <p>‘They’ve been supportive but at the same time disappointed with results. It’s been a laced message for Emery that he needs to be successful,’ continued Keown.</p>
      <p>‘The objective was to make it into the Champions League, if that’s not met then the club aren’t going to be happy.</p>
      <p>‘They were very clear with their message. They’re very disappointed in the way the team is performing at the moment and things need to improve.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a show of support but at the same time it’s a reminder to the manager of the expectations and what the objective is. He’ll be left in no doubt that if he doesn’t achieve that he won’t be there next season.’</p>
