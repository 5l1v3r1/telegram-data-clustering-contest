      <p>Gardai have issued a warning regarding ghost brokers who may have left a number of Irish motorists uninsured.</p>
      <p>An Garda Siochana Special Investigations Unit attached to DMR Roads Policing Unit, Dublin Castle, are carrying out a "comprehensive investigation" into "fraud-related insurance ghost brokering" activities throughout all of Ireland.</p>
      <p>Gardai are liaising with the Insurance Federation of Ireland and numerous insurance companies in relation to the matter, and are urging any motorist who has concerns about their car insurance not to use their motor vehicle on a public road.</p>

      <p> In a statement issued on Thursday night, Gardai said: "Any person with concerns about the credentials of their insurance policy, should contact your insurance company directly and verify if your motor vehicle insurance is valid.</p>
      <p>"If anyone has concerns about the bonafide of their Insurance Broker they should check with The Insurance Brokers Federation at centralbank.ie"</p>
