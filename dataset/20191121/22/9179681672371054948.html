      <h1>Pujie Black, a Watch Face App Every Smartwatch Owner Should Have, is Free Right Now</h1>

      <p>One of the best things to ever happen to smartwatches was the introduction of watch face makers and watch face stores. We’ve seen apps like Facer take off, but <b>Pujie Black</b> is another you should have in your inventory. It’s also one of the originals and just so happens to be free right now. It usually costs $1.99.</p>
      <p>With Pujie Black, you get a really easy-to-use set of tools to take watch face templates and completely customize them to your liking. There are a bunch of pre-made options that look good on their own that you can toss on your watch. It’s all pretty awesome if you like to tinker with your watch’s face from time to time.</p>
      <p>I should point out that there is a “Cloud Library” feature that includes shared watch face designs from others. It costs money, though, in the form of a subscription. But again, there are dozens of pre-made “Default” options in the app already.</p>
      <p>Pujie Black works on both Wear OS and Tizen.</p>
      <p>Again, normally $2, Pujie is free at the moment.</p>
