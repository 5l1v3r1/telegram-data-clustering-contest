      <h1>ESPN’s Prediction For Texans-Colts Tonight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:19:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Now is the time of the season when things get serious in the NFL. Teams begin to make their push for division titles and playoff spots.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s Thursday Night Football matchup between the Indianapolis Colts and Houston Texans will have a major impact on the AFC South. Right now, both teams are tied for the division lead with identical 6-4 records.</p>
      <p>The Tennessee Titans are right behind at 5-5, and while the Jacksonville Jaguars don’t have much room for error at 4-6, they are still in the hunt.</p>
      <p>ESPN has released <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401127865">its final prediction</a> for tonight’s game. Not surprisingly, the Texans are favored at home.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>According to the Football Power Index (FPI), Houston has a 65.4 percent chance of winning. Indianapolis is at 34.3 percent, with a 0.3 percent shot the game ends in a tie.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>These two teams met last month in Indianapolis, with the Colts earning a 30-23 victory. Jacoby Brissett was the star, throwing for 326 yards and four touchdowns, two of them to Zach Pascal. The Colts also intercepted Deshaun Watson twice in that game.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s game will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET. You can catch the action on FOX and NFL Network.</p>
