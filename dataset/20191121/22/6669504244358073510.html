      <p>QUEBEC - Desjardins Group President and CEO Guy Cormier defended his bank on Thursday, following revelations that one of its employees stole data belonging to all 4.2 million of the co-operative's clients.</p>
      <p>Cormier was called to testify in front of legislators in Quebec City, who are feeling pressure from citizens worried about the safety of their personal data.</p>
      <p>The CEO said data thefts happen all the time, and suggested lawmakers redirect their focus from his company and "expand" their gazes towards the larger problems around securing personal information.</p>
      <p>Cormier brought up other cases of major data breaches at such corporate giants as Marriott, Disney and Sephora and called internal fraud the "bete noire" of all organizations.</p>
      <p>Desjardins initially reported in June that 2.9 million customers had been affected by the theft — 2.7 million individuals and 173,000 businesses in Ontario and Quebec. But earlier this month, the bank revealed the breach was more widespread than first thought and actually hit 4.2 million members — all of its clients.</p>
      <p>The breach involved personal information — including social insurance numbers — but did not include banking information or passwords.</p>
      <p>Cormier said since June, he company has "worked hard. We fired the employee at fault. We developed new protections that are unequalled in Canada and also in a record time."</p>
      <p>He said his bank invests $70 million annually in IT protection and cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>Cormier told legislators that Canada's privacy commissioner recently revealed that in the past year, 28 million Canadians were the victims of data theft.</p>
      <p>He suggested other companies who suffered data breaches should take a lesson from the way his company handled itself during its crisis.</p>
      <p>"Who else acted with as much transparency, and the same sense of duty that Desjardins has shown in the past months?" Cormier said.</p>
      <p>The Quebec government is preparing two bills connected with personal data security that are scheduled to be tabled in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 21, 2019.</p>
