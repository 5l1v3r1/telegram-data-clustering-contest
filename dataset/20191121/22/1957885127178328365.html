      <h1>Co-op rat-smasher Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is free to play on Steam this weekend</h1>
      <h2>And there's 75% off too.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:07:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Wales</a></address>
      <p>If you've been gripped with a sudden, feverish desire to wallop some magical, man-sized rodents this weekend, but are struggling to locate a suitable outlet for your needs, perhaps you'd like to head over to Steam, where developer Fatshark's enjoyable four-player co-operate rat-smasher Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is having a free weekend.</p>
      <p>Vermintide 2 - which is free to try right now until Sunday, 24th November - plays out a little something like a furrier version of Valve's classic Left 4 Dead series. Combat is brutal - full of sword-swinging, axe-smashing, spell-casting, arrow-finging, and even the occasional gun - and the swarming hordes are giant rodent horrors, rather than your usual undead.</p>
      <p>The goal is simple enough; four players, each adopting one of five distinct character classes - Bright Wizard, Waywatcher, Witch Hunter, Dwarf Ranger, and Empire Soldier - must make it through to the end. Death is inevitable and co-ordination is key.</p>

      <p>The original Vermintide was praised for its frenzied co-op action, and this 2018 follow-up, with all its tweaks and enhancements, even more so.</p>
      <p>Dicebreaker's Johnny Chiodini called Vermintide 2 "a sequel done right" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-12-warhammer-vermintide-2-review-a-sequel-done-right">Recommended Eurogamer review</a>. "It's not overly ambitious or outlandish," he wrote, "instead choosing to build smartly on the solid foundations of its predecessor. New players will find a varied, exciting cooperative melee game - returning players will find the same well honed action, now free of many of the drawbacks of the original."</p>
      <p>If that sounds like something you might like to determine for yourself, Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/">free to try on Steam</a> from now until Sunday. And if you're sufficiently impressed by its rat-bopping action, the full game is discounted by 75% (it's currently £5.94 instead of £23.79, and DLC is also reduced) until Monday, 25th November.</p>
