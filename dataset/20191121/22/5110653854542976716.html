      <p>Good news for those looking to find the TV channel for Colts vs. Texans on "<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-2019-monday-sunday-thursday-night-football-tv-channels/e2smds4hyeex10dl3racx2auo">Thursday Night Football</a>": This game, scheduled to kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET, is not limited to NFL Network; it also will be presented nationally by Fox.</p>
      <p>The NFL schedulefor Week 12 presents us a Thursday-night matchup of AFC South rivals fighting for the lead in the division with both entering the game at 6-4. Because it beat Houston last month, Indianapolis has an edge it hopes to strengthen with a win as a 3 1/2-point road underdog in Houston.</p>

        <b>WEEK 12 NFL PICKS:<br/><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-12-nfl-picks-against-the-spread/1tjq0ocrnmrlb1hzigphiidlly">Against the spread</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-12-nfl-picks-predictions/1o5rmt44twusm1xkrsyqxe4efs">Straight-up predictions</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>In order for the Colts to pull off the upset, a couple hot streaks need to continue. Indianapolis is a perfect 3-0 against AFC South teams this season, a record that was stuffed withits win over Jacksonville last week. That victory came in part because quarterback Jacoby Brissettreturned from injury and managed a career-high 126.7 passer rating with 4touchdowns.In four career starts against Houston, Brissett is 4-0 with 8 touchdowns (7 passing, 1 rushing) and no interceptions for a 107.2 passer rating.</p>
      <p>And its no secret that the QB on the other sideline in this game will be the key to victory for the Texans. Deshaun Watson has 705 passing yards (352.5 per game) with 8 touchdowns and nointerceptions for a 143.6 passer rating in his past two home starts. In six career prime-time starts, hehas 16 touchdown passes and 2 interceptions for a 121.0 passer rating.</p>
