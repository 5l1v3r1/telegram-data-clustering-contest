      <p>The Argentine was sacked on Tuesday with the club hiring Jose Mourinho as his replacement the next day.</p>
      <p>The photos are the first public acknowledgement by Pochettino since his sacking.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994884/jose-mourinho-on-tottenham-job-i-am-a-better-manager-now">At his first news conference following his appointment on Wednesday</a>, Mourinho paid tribute to Pochettino and said the outgoing manager will find another top job.</p>
      <p>"I have to speak about Mauricio," Mourinho said. "I have to congratulate him for the work he has done. This club will always be his home. This training ground will always be his training ground. The door will always be open for him.</p>
      <p>"He will find happiness again. He will find a great club again. He will have a great future."</p>
      <p>Pochettino has been previously linked to clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich -- although none of those jobs would be immediately available.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's new deal at Spurs runs until the end of the 2022-23 season. Sources have told ESPN that the deal is worth around Â£15 million a year.</p>
