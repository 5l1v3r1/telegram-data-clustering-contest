      <p>According to the report on Yen, Kakraba was furious with the allegation especially when Ohemaa Woyeje who had allegedly manhandled her demanded her mobile phone to check if her husband’s number is saved on the phone.</p>

      <p>Ohemaa Woyeje allegedly gave the order and Kakraba was thrown to the floor and the car sped off.</p>
      <p>Overcome with fear, Kakraba started running after the car since she had no idea where she was. Couple with the fact that she could not contact anyone for help because her contacts have all been deleted, Kakraba was simply helpless.</p>

      <p>After a while, Yen reports that the friend of Kakraba saw the car returning with no indication that Kakraba was still in the car so he took off the opposite direction and after some time met helpless Kakraba and took her home.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, Yen’s report claims that Ohemaa Woyeje’s only reason for the suspicion was that another trader had informed her Mr. Owusu Kusi, her husband spends more time at Kakraba’s place and “She should work fast before Kakraba snatches her husband.</p>
      <p>But the report adds although Owusu Kusi spends time as Kakraba’s place, she always goes there to by Asana. They are not friends and Kakraba has no interest in her.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“It was shameful. She [Ohemaa] is not a child. As a popular and respected person, she should have investigated. It [the allegation] was false,” a source told YEN.</i>
