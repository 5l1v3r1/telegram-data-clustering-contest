      <p>(Reuters) - Gap Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GPS.N">GPS.N</a>) said on Thursday it would not sell its Old Navy apparels in China from early 2020 and instead would focus on its North America market to boost sales.</p>
      <p>Gap is planning to separate its better-performing Old Navy brand, giving investors hopes that the standalone company would be able to show better results than the Gap brand.</p>
