        <b>Great Britain's four-man bobsleigh team have finally been awarded their Olympic bronze medals almost six years after the Russian doping scandal denied them a podium place in Sochi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>John Jackson, Joel Fearon, Bruce Tasker and Stuart Benson received the medals in a presentation from Princess Anne midway through a glittering British Olympic Association Ball in London.</p>
      <p>They initially finished fifth in 2014 but two Russian crews that had finished above them have been retrospectively disqualified.</p>
      <p>Fearon, the only member of the team who is still competing in the sport, said: "It's nice but we still missed out on all the amazing stuff that would have happened if we had got the medal out there.</p>

      <p>"We gave our lives for that opportunity and we went away thinking we weren't good enough, but it turns out we actually were.</p>
      <p>"I have three boys now but at the time I only had my eldest, Simeon, who was four years old.</p>
      <p>"He actually made me a medal when I got home and told me not to worry. It's great that I can show him a real one now."</p>
