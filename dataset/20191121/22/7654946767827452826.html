      <p>Carli Lloyd wants to make one thing clear about her NFL kicking goals: “This isn’t just a publicity stunt.”</p>
      <p>The USWNT co-captain is serious about pursuing a kicking career in the NFL, but right now making the 2020 Olympic soccer team is Lloyd’s number one priority.</p>
      <p>“I know I can do it,” Lloyd said on “The Rich Eisen Show” on Wednesday. “I know I have the mental capacity in pressure situations.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/20/carli-lloyd-hits-absurd-field-goal-with-eagles-watching/">A video of Lloyd nailing a 55-yard field goal</a> went viral in August. The feat was impressive on its own, but drew even more attention in light of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/11/the-nfl-has-a-kicker-problem-and-its-getting-sad/">kicking woes that have plagued many NFL teams this year</a>.</p>
      <p>The video generated its share of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/28/keenan-allen-says-carli-lloyd-couldnt-hack-it-in-the-nfl/">skepticism and detractors</a>, too. Fans and experts questioned her ability to kick in a realistic game situation in full pads and surrounded by massive NFL linemen. Lloyd acknowledges that will present entirely different challenges.</p>
      <p>“I want to be good at it,” she said. “I want to be able to do it. That’s ultimately what it comes down to. There’s obviously a lot of other things that are a bit challenging, with big men on the line and people running at you.”</p>
      <p>Lloyd said she has kicked in full gear with pads and a helmet, and even <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/22/football-teams-have-reached-out-to-carli-lloyd-after-55-yard-field-goal/">received two offers from NFL teams</a> to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/27/carli-lloyd-received-offer-to-kick-in-nfl-preseason-game/">kick in a preseason game</a>. She was forced to decline the opportunities due to conflicts with her playing schedule.</p>

      <p>The 37-year old two-time Olympic gold medalist and two-time FIFA Women’s World Cup champion knows it would be a tough road ahead.</p>
      <p>“I know that there would be loads of people that want to see me fail,” Lloyd said. “That’s no different than the entirety of my career.”</p>
      <p>The 2020 Summer Olympics will take place from July 24 to August 9, three days after the 2020 NFL preseason starts on August 6.</p>
      <p>Lloyd, who turns 38 in July, would not be the first woman to try out for a spot on a NFL team. Lauren Silberman, also a kicker, participated in an NFL-sponsored tryout in 2013, but her bid was unsuccessful. Lloyd would be the first woman to successfully make an NFL team or play in a game.</p>
      <p>“If I can help pioneer and break down some doors for other women in the future, that would be amazing,” Lloyd said.</p>
      <p>Lloyd married professional golfer Brian Hollins in 2016. The two were high school sweethearts and currently reside in New Jersey.</p>
