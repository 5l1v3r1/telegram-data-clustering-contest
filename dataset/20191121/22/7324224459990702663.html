      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has said “Bruce” raised her children and she can enjoy time with them.</p>
      <p>She said she would always be their father “till the day I die”.</p>
      <p>The former Olympic athlete and reality TV star said that Bruce Jenner cared for her six children before she came out as a transgender woman in 2015.</p>

      <p>Jenner said that Caitlyn now has the pleasure of spending time with the famous family.</p>
      <p>She explained her relationships to campmates on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>The gold medal-winning star spoke with Kate Garraway in the jungle, and detailed her family relationships.</p>
      <p>Asked if she felt like a father to her children, Jenner explained: “Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them.”</p>
      <p>Praising her family, the reality star continued: “My kids all call me Dad, Kendall asked me first and I said ‘Dad’, I’m your Dad and I’ll always be your Dad till the day I die.</p>
      <p>“But what they’re really good at, which shocks me all the time, is when they’re talking about me – ‘my Dad, she’ – and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it.”</p>
      <p>Garraway and Jacqueline Jossa began the conversation as they became tearful due to missing their children.</p>
      <p>Emotions ran high elsewhere in camp as Jossa became reluctant to enter the draw to join her fellow contestants in the sparse Jungle Jail.</p>
      <p>Andrew Maxwell was adamant that all of the campmates should be involved in drawing straws to determine who would join the imprisoned Andy Whyment and actor Cliff Parisi.</p>
      <p>The pair had earned eight stars in the Bush Tucker Trial, confronting spiders and buffalo, and were grateful that the camp decided to share their food.</p>
      <p>Jenner was also taught a Girls Aloud dance routine by Nadine Coyle during some down-time in camp, with the singer saying: “Caitlyn just threw herself into it, we’ll teach her Sound Of The Underground next.”</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here returns tomorrow at 9pm on ITV.</p>
