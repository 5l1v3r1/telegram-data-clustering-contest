      <p>With the mantle of Captain Marvel having existed within the Marvel Universe decades prior to the character's big-screen debut, Andy Park -- Director of Visual Development at Marvel Studios -- recently discussed how the studio's concept artists incorporated ideas from the source material in order to engineer their own take on the character for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4/">Avengers: Endgame</a>.</p>
      <p>"Finally I can show this! Hereâ€™s the approved concept design I did for Captain Marvel in<i> Avengers: Endgame</i>," park wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5GHBVAgqxK/">Instagram</a>. "I loved designing her original look in her solo film earlier this year. And what a blast it was to revisit her design trying to envision what her modern day look over 20 some years later would look like. I did a ton of different options. The thinking behind this one was essentially taking every look through the decades from the original (male) Captain Marvel to Ms. Marvel to her modern day comic book look and combining them into one new original look. It was a fun exploration."</p>
