      <p>According to reports, former <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> lightweight champion, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rafael-dos-anjos">Rafael dos Anjos</a> is all set to return to the Octagon against <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/michael-chiesa">Michael Chiesa</a> in a welterweight bout at the upcoming UFC Fight Night 166 set to take place on 25th January next year at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
      <p>ESPN journalist Bret Okamoto confirmed the news in a tweet, saying,</p>
      <blockquote>"Rafael dos Anjos vs. Michael Chiesa agreed to for UFC Fight Night on Jan.25 in Raleigh, North Carolina, per sources."</blockquote>

      <p>The fight will have huge implications on the #5 ranked UFC welterweight dos Anjos' quest for the title in a spectacularly stacked division that boasts the likes of Jorge Masvidal, Colby Covington, Kamaru Usman and Tyron Woodley competing for the welterweight gold.</p>
      <p>After making a smashing debut in the new weight class by submitting Kevin Lee at UFC Fight Night 152, dos Anjos' momentum was cut short after a disappointing loss on his last outing against Leon Edwards. This time around though, the Brazilian will be looking to make amends by putting up a show against Chiesa. However, an opponent of Chiesa's caliber will certainly not make life easy for dos Anjos inside the cage.</p>
      <p>Michael Chiesa, on the other hand, will head into the fight with back to back wins against Carlos Condit and Diego Sanchez respectively and will be looking to make the momentum count.</p>
      <p>If this fight is indeed booked, it will be an intriguing watch for sure!</p>
