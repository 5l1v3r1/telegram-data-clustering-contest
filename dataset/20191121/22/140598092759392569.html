      <h1>RFL considering offering Wayne Bennett new contract despite winless Great Britain tour</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ross-heppenstall/" target="_blank">Ross Heppenstall</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-league/2019/11/14/have-best-chance-success-need-wayne-bennett-helm-want-stay/">Wayne Bennett</a> is likely to be handed a new contract by the Rugby Football League despite presiding over Great Britain’s disastrous southern hemisphere tour.​</p>
      <p>The veteran Australian, universally regarded as one of the all-time greatest coaches, has been employed as England coach for the past four years.​</p>
      <p>He was tasked with leading Great Britain in their recent four-match tour of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, which resulted in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-league/2019/11/16/great-britain-suffer-tour-whitewash-aspapua-new-guinea-inflict/">four straight defeats,</a> and his contract with the governing body has now expired.​</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-league/2019/11/10/great-britains-latest-defeat-raises-questions-wayne-bennetts/">Bennett came under heavy fire </a>for his squad selection and apparent failure to differentiate between Great Britain, a once iconic brand revived after 12 years in hibernation, and England.​</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the 69-year-old has frequently voiced his desire to lead England into next year’s Ashes series against Australia and 2021 World Cup, both on home soil.​</p>
      <p>Asked whether Bennett could be awarded a new deal, RFL chief executive Ralph Rimmer said: “Most certainly – we shouldn’t forget what he’s done.​</p>
      <p>“Yes, we’ve had a poor year on the field and we’re all hurting – including the players and coaches.​</p>

      <p>“But until this point, we have progressed really well. We have put a challenging, difficult international programme together and I don’t regret doing that at all.”​</p>
      <p>A review of Great Britain’s failure is being conducted by Rimmer and the RFL’s rugby director, Kevin Sinfield, and a decision on the England job will be made thereafter.​</p>
      <p>Rimmer said: “In terms of the two brands, the review is taking place and it will take care of all aspects of the tour.​</p>
      <p>“It didn’t go as planned on the field but many other things went very well.​</p>
      <p>“It’s important the review is considered and reactionary. We’re hurt a little but we need to take the objective view. ​</p>
      <p>“Some aspects we are disappointed in, others not so much, but there will be a great deal of consultation and Wayne’s role is a part of that. ​</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be a considered piece of work that will get us to a good place.”​</p>
      <p>Former Wigan Warriors coach Shaun Wane, currently employed by the Scottish Rugby Union, and Castleford Tigers boss Daryl Powell have been touted as potential successors to Bennett.​</p>
      <p>Bennett, though, remains popular with his players and guided England to the 2017 World Cup final against Australia, where they lost 6-0 in Brisbane, and orchestrated three wins from four Test matches against New Zealand last year.​</p>
      <p>Rimmer, who said Sinfield’s position was not under any threat, added: “There’s plenty of coaching talent out there. ​</p>
      <p>“That doesn’t mean Wayne’s position is either weakened or strengthened, however. He wants to stay on.”​</p>
      <p>Bennett lamented the absence of a mid-season Test this year but talks are under way to ensure there is one ahead of the 2020 Ashes series and it will be away from home.​</p>
      <p>Rimmer said: “The intention is to have a midseason Test. We’re in dialogue at this moment in time.”​</p>
      <p>The RFL supremo said the prospect of Australia playing midweek games against Super League sides during next year’s Ashes series was “still under discussion”.</p>
