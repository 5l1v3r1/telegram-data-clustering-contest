      <p>Almost $50 billion worth of planes were just sold at the Dubai Airshow, as the world’s largest aircraft makers gathered in the desert for five days.</p>
      <p>The world’s two largest plane makers, Boeing and Airbus, saw billions worth of orders both for their newest plane types and their flagship models.</p>
      <p>While airlines typically negotiate a better deal than the list prices – which are the suggested retail price by the manufacturer – the spree proved that airlines were willing to spend <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-airshow-idUSKBN1XR0S1">despite industry fears</a> that some of the larger orders would not be finalized.</p>
