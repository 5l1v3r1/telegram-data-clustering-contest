      <p>Curious about the origin of lipstick or the evolution of eyeliner? Soon New Yorkers will be able to delve into the history of the beauty industry at The Makeup Museum in <a href="https://thespaces.com/tag/manhattan">Manhattan’s</a> Meatpacking District.</p>
      <p>The new cultural venue is slated to open in May 2020 in a semi-permanent space at 94 Gansevoort Street with the inaugural exhibition <i>Pink Jungle: 1950s Makeup in America.</i> Details on the space are scant at this point, but according to <a href="https://makeupmuseum.com/">The Makeup Museum’s website,</a> it will anchor there for six months while its organisers seek out a permanent flagship space in the city. Exhibitions will also head out on global tours after wrapping in the space.</p>

      <p>Content will span 10,000 years of history across the globes, from the ancient Egyptians’ use of kohl eyeliner to Japanese <i>kabuki</i> and <i>geisha</i> makeup and modern drag performers who’ve perfected the art of contouring.</p>
      <p><i>Pink Jungle</i> will explore the explosion of the modern beauty industry after WWII, looking at makeup trends made famous by the era’s most prominent female stars including Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn.</p>
