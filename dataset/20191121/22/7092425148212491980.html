      <p>Dundalk natives <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/andrea-corr-praised-opening-experiences-miscarriages-340688"><i>Andrea</i></a>, Sharon, Caroline and their brother Jim made up the band that delivered 90s classics like Summer Sunshine and Only When I Sleep.</p>

      <p>So, could 2020 be the year The Corrs go back on tour?</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://evoke.ie/2019/11/21/showbiz/andrea-corr-the-corrs-reunion-tour"><i>Evoke.ie</i></a> at the An Post Irish Book Awards Andrea said: "We are talking about it, there are no definitive dates as yet.</p>

      <p>When asked whether or not her return to music might lead Andrea to make a wider return to media she didn't fancy it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/andrea-corr-opens-suffering-five-miscarriages-340164"><i>The Irish beauty</i></a> also said she wouldn't appear on Dancing with the Stars.</p>
      <p>Andrea added: "No, I think they are great to watch but I would not like to do that."</p>
