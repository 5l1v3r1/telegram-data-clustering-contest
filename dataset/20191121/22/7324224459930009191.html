      <p>Sir Keir Starmer has said Britain “won’t go back to normal” after Brexit or a vote to remain.</p>
      <p>During a meeting in support of Edinburgh Labour candidate Ian Murray, Sir Keir said, regardless of the decision made after his party’s proposed second referendum, the country will remain divided.</p>
      <p>The claim comes on the same day his party released its manifesto with a promise to negotiate a new deal with the EU and hold a second referendum on the issue within six months.</p>

      <p>The shadow Brexit secretary said the only way to unite the country will be to take action to ensure people no longer feel disenfranchised.</p>
      <p>Sir Keir told the meeting: “Anybody who thinks that the deal with Europe is going to resolve the issue, needs to think again.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t going to be resolved. There isn’t going to be a happy day, when it’s either the deal or remain is decided and it just goes back to normal.</p>
      <p>“That’s never going to happen.”</p>
      <p>Sir Keir, who was speaking alongside former prime minister Gordon Brown on Thursday, echoed an analogy made by a journalist in recent weeks, who likened Brexit to being pregnant.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s like childbirth.</p>
      <p>“‘As soon as childbirth is out of the way, I’ll go back to the theatre and spending time with my friends’.</p>
      <p>“This is never going back and it’s never going back because of the strength of feeling that came out of that vote in 2016.</p>
      <p>“Because that phrase, ‘Take Back Control’, was a Heineken phrase. It really got into people.</p>
      <p>“The more people were asked if they want the status quo, the more they answered no.”</p>
      <p>Sir Keir continued, saying the people who feel disenfranchised should be listened to and actions taken to change their views.</p>
      <p>He also said it was important to give the people of the UK another vote on the issue.</p>

      <p>He said: “If millions of people tell you that a political or economic situation isn’t working for them, you’ve got to listen to that.</p>
      <p>“We’re never going to get past Brexit if we only focus on one part of it: the deal.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to focus on the other bit, which told us that we need much greater change than we’ve had for a long time.</p>
      <p>“That told us that people feel disenfranchised at almost every level.</p>
      <p>“The workers, in their health service, in their ability to believe they could trust their politicians and that has got to change.</p>
      <p>“This will never be resolved if we don’t match the deal that we come up with with a completely different offer for our country.”</p>
