      <p>Almost $US50 billion worth of planes were just sold at the Dubai Airshow, as the world’s largest aircraft makers gathered in the desert for five days.</p>
      <p>The world’s two largest plane makers, Boeing and Airbus, saw billions worth of orders both for their newest plane types and their flagship models.</p>
      <p>While airlines typically negotiate a better deal than the list prices – which are the suggested retail price by the manufacturer – the spree proved that airlines were willing to spend <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-airshow-idUSKBN1XR0S1">despite industry fears</a> that some of the larger orders would not be finalised.</p>
      <h3>Emirates: $US25 billion on 5o Airbus long-haul jets, and 30 Boeing 787</h3>
