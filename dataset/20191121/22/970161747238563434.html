      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> star Andy Whyment is the new favourite to become king of the jungle after he made his debut alongside Cliff Parisi.</p>
      <p>The Coronation Street star appeared dressed as a cowboy to take on a challenge in Ol’ Dingo Town.</p>
      <p>A big fan of I’m A Celebrity any way, he had hosts Ant and Dec and viewers in stitches as he wound up Cliff, who had to stick his hand inside all sorts of disgusting things in a bid to win food for camp.</p>
      <p>Trying to control his laughter at the former EastEnders star, he fangirled over the show and said: ‘I can’t help it sorry Cliff. It’s just making me laugh, I feel like I’m watching the TV at home.’</p>
      <p>His antics have made him an instant favourite with bookies to win the series.</p>

      <p>Despite only just arriving in the jungle, the actor’s odds of winning are now 9/4, down from 10/1.</p>
      <p>Roman Kemp is in second place at 3/1 followed by Jacqueline Jossa at 9/2 and Caitlyn Jenner at 13/2.</p>
      <p>Jessica O’Reilly of Ladbrokes said: ‘Andrew’s barely been in the jungle a minute and he’s stormed to the top of the betting.</p>

      <p>‘The self-confessed super fan of the show has really struck a chord with punters and dingo dollars are coming in thick and fast for him to emerge as the winner.’</p>
      <p>Ian Wright is next on the list at 10/1 with James Haskell at 12/1.</p>
      <p>Their arrival <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebrity-tension-jacqueline-jossa-andrew-maxwell-clash-bushtucker-trials-11197486/">did cause some tension</a>, as two of the current campmates had to pick two people to head to the Jailhouse to join Andy and Cliff.</p>
      <p>In order to choose they decided to draw named water bottles, which Jacqueline Jossa felt was ‘scary’.</p>
      <p>When Kate Garraway and Ian Wright suggested that she could rule herself, she added: ‘Yeah but it’s not very heroic.’</p>
      <p>Andrew appeared to agree, and said: ‘I think it has to be everyone in, I don’t think it’s fair to count yourself out.</p>
      <p>‘It’s an ordeal that has to be shared. It’s not back to Snake Rock, it could be anything.’</p>

      <p>Adele Roberts chipped in: ‘I think it’s just anybody that’s up for it. If anyone wants to stay they should be allowed.’</p>

      <p>Things began to get heated and ended with Jacqueline and Nadine Coyle choosing not to take part.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the bush telegram, Andrew said he didn’t understand why the women got to rule themselves out.</p>
      <p>‘Jacqueline and Nadine said they didn’t want to go and erm…that’s the end of that…’ he recalled.</p>
      <p>Eventually – are tensions rose yet again – Kate and Andrew agreed to go to the Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>The latest falling out came after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-andrew-maxwell-catches-jacqueline-jossa-talking-super-awkward-moment-11193330/">Andrew overheard Jaq talking about him in a seriously awkward moment</a>.</p>
