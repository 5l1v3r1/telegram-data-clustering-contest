      <p>The principal and vice-chancellor was suspended for allegedly failing to pay rent on a luxury flat provided to him by Dundee University.</p>
      <p>It also emerged staff had made complaints about bullying to bosses. Investigations were launched into both claims.</p>
      <p>Tory MSP Bill Bowman said: “This saga has been hanging over a brilliant institution for months now.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps it’s best to draw a line under the matter and move on.”</p>
      <p>Dundee said Prof Atherton — who took over the role in January — stepped down as its “vision for the future and values it holds are different to his aspirations”.</p>
      <p>After tax and repayment of part of the £40,000 “disruption allowance” he got for his move from Lancaster University to Dundee, he will have around £70,000.</p>
