      <h1>REPORT: Patriots Have ‘Kicked The Tires’ On Bringing Back Antonio Brown</h1>

      <p>Just a little over 2 months ago, the New England Patriots parted ways with Antonio Brown due to his behavior of sending text messages to a sexual assault accuser, but things have seemingly changed since that time period.</p>
      <p>WEEI in Boston is reporting the Patriots have ‘kicked the tires’ on the idea of bringing the controversial wide receiver back on the team.</p>

      <p>Brown took to social media on Tuesday and formally apologized to owner Robert Kraft following his release from the team. Even Tom Bradfy and several other Patriots players liked that post.</p>

      <p>Brown only played one game for the franchise and lasted just eleven days before things soured. He grabbed four catches including a touchdown, on eight targets during New England’s 43-0 win over the Dolphins.</p>
      <p>Brady has already stated how much he likes Brown and has griped about the team’s offense, especially after the team’s win over the Eagles last Sunday.</p>
