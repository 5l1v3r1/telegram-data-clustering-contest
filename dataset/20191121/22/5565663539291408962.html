      <p>Zimbabweans who use the Ecocash payment platform system have expressed disappointment over poor service which has haunted them since Sunday after the company embarked on a systems upgrade.<br/><br/>After the completion of a major system upgrading process, millions of Zimbabweans who use Ecocash have continued to register dissatisfaction with the poo service they are getting from the mobile giant.<br/><br/>Some customers have called on the government to intervene and deal with the issue of the dominance of one mobile transfer service provider.<br/><br/>Initially the confusion arose after the company announced that it had completed the upgrading system prompting users to check whether the system was now functional only to realise that it was still difficult to buy airtime and pay for services using the platform.<br/><br/>In a message sent to some of its clients this Wednesday,  Ecocash said, all services are up  and running.<br/><br/>Efforts to get a comment from the service provider regarding the prevailing challenges were fruitless as the company's public relations officer said he was in a meeting and promised to get in touch with this news crew after 30 minutes, a promise that was not fulfilled at the time of going on air.</p>
