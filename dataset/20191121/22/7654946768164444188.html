      <h1>FEC sends de Blasio 3rd warning letter over 2020-bid fundraising</h1>

      <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio received his third warning letter in three months from the Federal Election Commission over apparent fundraising violations for his failed 2020 bid.</p>
      <p>The letters <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/20/feds-demand-answers-about-de-blasios-campaign-fundraising/">stem from a $52,581 debt</a> his cash-strapped presidential campaign owed to his state political account, NY Fairness PAC, which he used to pay for 2020-related expenses.</p>
      <p>The latest missive, filed Thursday, says the repayment of that loan on Sept. 11 constitutes a prohibited transfer or contribution because it’s over the $5,000 limit.</p>
      <p>De Blasio dropped out of the Democratic primary race just nine days later.</p>
      <p>It’s the second letter de Blasio’s gotten from the FEC this week.</p>
      <p>Federal regulators on Tuesday flagged the $123,000 his federal political action account — the similarly named Fairness PAC — spent on polling and other costs, also to aid his 2020 bid.</p>
      <p>That letter <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/fec-warns-de-blasio-over-presidential-fundraising-irregularities/">noted that transfers between federal PACs</a> and campaign accounts are only allowed within 30 days of declaring a candidacy — a deadline the perennially late mayor missed by two weeks.</p>
      <p>De Blasio used his NY Fairness PAC — which was initially established to aid fellow progressive candidates — to cover rent, digital advertising and travel during the first few days of his campaign in May.</p>
      <p>The expenses billed to the PAC included $8,562 for “launch weekend travel” and $4,2000 for rent at The Yard, the Brooklyn coworking space where de Blasio’s campaign was headquartered.</p>
      <p>The most recent FEC letter warns, “Although the Commission may take further legal action, your prompt action to refund the prohibited amount will be taken into consideration.”</p>
      <p>“Failure to adequately respond by the response date noted above could result in an audit or enforcement action,” it says. A response is due by Dec. 26.</p>
      <p>But the FEC can’t take an enforcement action against the mayor because the agency has been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/29/why-the-fec-cant-probe-ilhan-omars-campaign-finances-anytime-soon/">operating without a quorum</a> since September.</p>
      <p>The six-person body currently has just three commissioners. It needs at least four to issue rulings.</p>
      <p>The lead commissioner, Ellen Weintraub, has <a href="https://twitter.com/EllenLWeintraub/status/1166061287933186053">urged President Trump</a> to nominate new members, which must then be confirmed by the Senate.</p>
      <p>A de Blasio spokesman did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.</p>
      <p>Regulators and prosecutors have dogged de Blasio for years over his fundraising practices.</p>
      <p>In 2017 he <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/03/16/de-blasio-dodges-federal-charges-in-campaign-fundraising-probe/">narrowly ducked</a> indictment for trading favors with donors to his 2013 mayoral campaign, his 2014 failed campaign to win control of the state Senate and to a nonprofit run by his allies, the Campaign for One New York.</p>
      <p>Later a city Department of Investigation report <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/17/de-blasio-violated-ethics-laws-by-fundraising-for-own-nonprofit-doi/">found de Blasio’s CONY fundraising</a> broke city ethics rules.</p>
      <p>Just last week the state’s Commission on Public Ethics <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/donor-to-de-blasio-slush-fund-hit-with-10k-fine-by-state-authorities/">announced a $10,000 settlement</a> with Douglaston Development, a major CONY contributor.</p>
      <p>The firm won $12 million in taxpayer funds and public land in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx in December 2014 for a new project. Two months later, de Blasio spoke to one of the firm’s executives about donating to the nonprofit.</p>
      <p>The commission has collected at least $125,000 to settle cases with multiple CONY contributors and its investigation into the nonprofit continues.</p>
