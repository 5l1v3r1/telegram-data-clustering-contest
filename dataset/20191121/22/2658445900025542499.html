      <p>He said: “There is hope for PDP in Ekiti State. We should come together and out our house in order.”</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He congratulated Olujimi for sustaining the struggle that gave her victory, adding that she had done the chapter proud.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is the Lord’s doing, an obvious triumph of good over evil and sure hope that democracy will thrive in Nigeria.”</p>
      <p>Agbaje said the judiciary had done a great job, stressing that the victory had rekindled hope that the party has a future.</p>
      <p>He aded: “It was a well deserved victory for a vibrant and hard working federal legislator who shook the 8th Assembly and justified her position as the Red Chamber’s Minority Leader.”</p>
      <p>Agbaje described the victory as a morale booster and a wake up call from politicsl slumber.</p>
      <p>Describing Olujimi as a “round peg in a round hole ” he advised her to remain focused, be truly forgiving and rekindle her faith in God, to whom her victory should be dedicated.</p>
      <p>He said the senator’s tenacity of purpose, doggedness, humility, outstanding performance, unrestrained compassion and generosity have made her a role model and worthy leader.</p>
      <p>Urging party leaders and members to unite for future contests, Agbaje said they should embrace the repositioning agenda.</p>
      <p>He said:”It is a crusade aimed at restoring sanity, decorum and due process to foster and strengthen internal democracy and mutual respect.</p>
      <p>“We must, above all, accord due recognition and respect and to our leaders and elders at all levels. Under the emerging new leadership and soothing atmosphere, the dark days of imposition and unbridled impunity, maladministration and a lot more, which the party paid dearly for, are gone for good.”</p>
      <p>Prince appealed to the founding fathers of the party, especially Senator Clement Awoyelu, Professor Tunde Adeniran, Chief Dayo Okondo,  Dr. Folayan, former Governor Segun Oni, Justice Ojuolape, Chief Ojuawo, and Dr. Bode Olowoporoku, to return to the party.</p>
      <p>He also urged other chieftains who left in frustration or are aloof to return for the rescue mission.</p>
