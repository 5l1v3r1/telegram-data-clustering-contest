      <h1>ADL: Update to Latest Anti-Semitism Survey ‘Troubling, To Say the Least’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:33:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>Anti-Semitism is still rising, not only in the United States but elsewhere around the world as well, according to the results of the latest global survey by the Anti-Defamation League.</p>
      <p>The data that were gathered are “troubling, to say the least,” the organization said Thursday when it released the <a href="https://global100.adl.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=whole&amp;utm_campaign=g1002019&amp;utm_content=e01-l01">update to its ADL Global 100 Index</a> at its annual Never Is Now Summit on anti-Semitism and Hate.</p>
      <p>The global survey, which informs about emerging trends in anti-Semitism, has published data since 2014.</p>
      <p>According to the most recent data, there has been a marked increase in anti-Semitic attitudes in Eastern Europe, South Africa and South America in the last four years.</p>
      <p>• One in four Europeans polled subscribe to most of the anti-Semitic stereotypes tested.<br/>• Stereotypes about Jewish control of business and the financial markets are among the most pernicious and enduring anti-Semitic beliefs.<br/>• The falsehood of Jewish disloyalty/dual loyalty is widespread across Europe.<br/>• 40% or more of respondents in 10 of the 18 countries polled thought “Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust.”</p>
      <p>However, there was some good news; there was widespread support for social media reform to combat online harassment.</p>
