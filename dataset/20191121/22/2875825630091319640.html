      <h1>Eden Hazard explains why he rejected PSG transfer before Real Madrid move</h1>
      <h2>The Belgian quit Premier League side Chelsea for Real Madrid in the summer, moving to Spain in a switch which could surpass £130million</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:33:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Eden Hazard has revealed that he rejected Paris Saint-German several times during his Chelsea spell - because he couldn't play for another French team other than Lille.</p>
      <p>Hazard spent seven years at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> after joining from Lille in 2012, he went on to score 110 goals in 352 games and bowed out with a brace in the Blues' Europa League final victory over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>The Belgian eventually quit the Premier League for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> in the summer, moving to Spain in a switch which could surpass £130million.</p>
      <p>And Hazard has admitted that PSG enquired about his availability on a number of occasions, but he would only return to Ligue 1 if it was with Lille.</p>

      <p>"They often tried to recruit me, but I didn't want to return to Ligue 1 unless it was to join Lille," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/">L'Equipe</a> .</p>
      <p>"I always said no to them. It was clear in my mind that if I were to return to France it would be with Lille."</p>
      <p>Hazard, meanwhile, believes former Chelsea team mate Frank Lampard has the platform to become the one of the best managers in the world after a bright start to his reign at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Hazard left Chelsea to join Spanish giants Real Madrid at the start of the season, just before Lampard replaced Maurizio Sarri as manager at the west London club.</p>

      <p>Lampard has steadied the ship at Chelsea after a difficult start, guiding them to six consecutive Premier League victories and level on points with second-placed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City heading into the international break.</p>
      <p>When asked if he was surprised by Lampard's instant impact at Chelsea, Hazard told reporters: "No, not at all.</p>
      <p>"I know Frank as a player, not as a manager, but he's a great guy. He's showed already after four months that he can be one of the best managers in the world.</p>
      <p>"The good thing is that they are playing with young players, young English players. For England it's good, for Chelsea it's good. They are lucky to have young players with quality."</p>
