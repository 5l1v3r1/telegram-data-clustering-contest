      <p>MILAN — French media group Vivendi is prepared to sell part of its stake in Mediaset at a loss in an attempt to reach a deal to end years of bitter legal disputes with the Italian broadcaster, two sources close to the matter said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>One of the sources said that in order “to show its goodwill” Vivendi was prepared to sell the Mediaset shares held by its Simon Fiduciaria trustee at a price of 3.25 euros each.</p>
      <p>That compares with the 3.7 euros per share paid by Vivendi in 2016 to build its 29% stake, which Mediaset considers hostile.</p>
      <p>Vivendi, which is also a leading investor in Italy’s former phone monopoly Telecom Italia, holds a 20% stake in Mediaset through Simon Fiduciaria to comply with a ruling by Italy’s telecoms watchdog.</p>
      <p>The sources said Vivendi would sell all the shares held by Simon Fiduciaria.</p>
      <p>Vivendi has challenged in court a plan by Mediaset to fold Mediaset’s domestic and Spanish businesses under a Dutch holding company to pursue pan-European alliances.</p>
      <p>Mediaset had offered to repurchase shares held by investors who wanted to opt out of the proposed corporate overhaul at 2.77 euros, a price deemed too low at the time by Vivendi.</p>
      <p>As part of recent attempts to reach a settlement, Mediaset had offered to buy back the shares held by Vivendi at that same price, potentially with help from other investors.</p>
      <p>The price of 3.25 euros a share stands halfway between what Vivendi originally paid and the withdrawal price offered by Mediaset.</p>
      <p>One of the two sources said Vivendi hoped to reach an accord by Friday’s deadline. But a third source said Mediaset could face problems from shareholders who have opted out if it paid Vivendi a higher price than that they accepted.</p>
      <p>Mediaset’s corporate reorganization was put on hold last month by a Spanish court, following a request by Vivendi.</p>
      <p>The French group has filed a similar request in Italy and a Milan court this month gave the two parties until Friday to seek to reach an accord. A hearing is scheduled in Milan on Friday.</p>
      <p>A Mediaset source said the broadcaster would hold a board meeting on Friday ahead of the hearing and commit to amend in part the by-laws of the new Dutch holding company in accordance with indications previously received from the court.</p>
      <p>Sources have told Reuters the two sides were struggling to hammer out a compromise.</p>
      <p>Failure to end the stalemate would likely complicate the pan-European project by Mediaset, which is controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.</p>
      <p>It would also keep both companies locked in a protracted legal dispute which analysts say is distracting them from efforts to tackle increasing industry competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime.</p>
      <p>Vivendi and Mediaset have been at odds since the French conglomerate in 2016 pulled out of an 800 million euro ($885 million) agreement to buy Mediaset’s loss-making pay-TV unit.</p>
      <p>Shares in Mediaset closed up 0.4% at 2.681 euros on Thursday. ($1 = 0.9042 euros) (Reporting by Elvira Pollina in Milan and Gwenaelle Barzic in Paris; Editing by Valentina Za, Susan Fenton and Daniel Wallis)</p>
