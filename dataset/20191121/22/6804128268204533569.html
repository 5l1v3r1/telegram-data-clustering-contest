      <h1>West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini warns Spurs fans over Jose Mourinho's manager record</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers boss locks horns with an old foe in the dugout this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho are not the best of friends by any stretch - they don't hate each other and there is a mutual respect there, but it goes no further.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was appointed the new head coach at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday morning and his first match is a trip to London Stadium on Saturday lunchtime to take on Pellegrini's out-of-form West Ham in what is likely to be a lively London derby.</p>
      <p>Mourinho and Pellegrini have had their differences before, most notably when the Portuguese succeeded the Chilean at Real Madrid and continually referred to his predecessor as Mr Pellegrino.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Pellegrini called Mourinho "selfish" though the two have been quiet with each other in more recent years.</p>
      <p>The under pressure manager was, unsurprisingly, asked about his previously fractious relationship with Mourionho at his pre-match press conference ahead of the match this weekend and a clearly irritated Hammers boss - who had been asked enough questions about the former Manchester United manager by then - said: "Five of the six questions you ask me are on this.</p>
      <p>"A lot of times teams that are successful in one season, maybe in the next, they are not, they don't play in the same way. You saw what happened with Chelsea when Mourinho was manager.</p>

      <p>"They won the title then the next season he was sacked."</p>
      <p>Pellegrini was also asked if the Premier League is better for Mourinho being back in it having been sacked by Manchester United in December last year.</p>
      <p>The charismatic Portuguese, arguably a polar opposite of Pellegrini, is never one to shy away from speaking his mind or controversy whereas the Chilean often keeps his cards very close to his chest.</p>
      <p>"I think that Jose Mourinho is a manager demonstrates what he is doing in every league that he works, in Italy in Spain, here in England, a manager that has a lot of titles behind him also so he will also be a manager who is good for football.</p>
