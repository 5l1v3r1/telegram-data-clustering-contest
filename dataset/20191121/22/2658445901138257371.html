Odebiyi said: “I want to commend everybody for the works being done in this senatorial district. On behalf of the Senate, I  want to appreciate the Customs for its efforts towards generating revenue for the nation as a whole. The reason I am here is to keep track of the issue on border closure, ban of petrol products, get further information and brainstorm to achieve desired results.”</p>
