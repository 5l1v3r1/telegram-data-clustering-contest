      <h1>Trump forbids US Navy from expelling SEAL</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:17:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Donald Trump on Thursday told the US Navy not to pursue any efforts to oust from the elite SEAL commando unit a member accused of war crimes and then given clemency by the Republican president.</p>
      <p>Trump's statement came just one day after the Navy launched a procedure that could end with Edward Gallagher and three other members of his unit being stripped of their Trident pins -- effectively booting them from the SEALs.</p>
      <p>"The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin. This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!" Trump tweeted.</p>
      <p>In July, the 40-year-old Gallagher was acquitted of charges related to the stabbing death of a wounded Islamic State prisoner in Iraq in 2017, attempted murder of other civilians and obstruction of justice.</p>
      <p>But he was convicted of a lesser charge -- posing with the slain fighter's body in a group picture with other SEALs -- and demoted one rank, from chief petty officer to petty officer first class.</p>
      <p>Last week, Trump reversed the demotion and granted clemency to Gallagher, whose case had been championed by Fox News, which the president follows closely.</p>
      <p>A panel of Navy SEAL officers had been set to convene in December to decide whether Gallagher can remain in the unit.</p>
      <p>It was to deliver an opinion to the commander of the US Navy's special forces, who would then make a recommendation to naval command, which has the final say.</p>
      <p>The intervention by Trump -- commander-in-chief of the US military -- throws that process into doubt.</p>
      <p>Also last week, Trump dismissed a second degree murder conviction against Army First Lieutenant Clint Lorance, who was six years into a 19-year term for ordering soldiers in 2012 to fire on three unarmed Afghan men on a motorcycle, two of whom died.</p>
      <p>He also granted clemency to West Point graduate Matt Golsteyn, an ex-member of the elite US Army Green Berets, charged with premeditated murder in the shooting death of an alleged Taliban bomb-maker in 2010.</p>
