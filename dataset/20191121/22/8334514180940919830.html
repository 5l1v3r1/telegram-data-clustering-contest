      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/JPM.N">JPM.N</a>) said Thursday it is giving free online trades to more customers and lowering the amount of money needed to open one of its robo-adviser accounts, as firms across the industry bow to pressure to reduce fees and account minimums.</p>

      <p>The move means that people with as little as $500 can open a You Invest Portfolios account, and Chase customers who have at least $15,000 in their checking accounts or meet other key metrics can trade for free online and on the mobile app.</p>
      <p>Kelli Keough, global head of digital wealth management at JPMorgan, said the bank lowered the barriers because it wants more Chase banking clients to be Chase investment clients.</p>
      <p>It also comes about two months after the largest U.S. online brokerage, Charles Schwab Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/SCHW.K">SCHW.K</a>), eliminated commissions and fees for most online trades.</p>
      <p>Schwab is reportedly exploring a merger with rival TD Ameritrade (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMTD.O">AMTD.O</a>) in a bid to gain scale and more clients to support its new zero-commission business model.</p>
      <p>You Invest Portfolios, which launched in July, previously required investors to have at least $2,500.</p>
      <p>You Invest Trade, which launched in 2018, previously offered free unlimited trades only to sapphire banking customers, who keep at least $75,000 in their accounts, and Chase private client customers, who keep at least $250,000. Private bank and securities division clients were also eligible for free trades.</p>
      <p>Premier plus checking clients received 100 free trades a year.</p>
      <p>Starting on Monday, Chase customers with premier plus can place unlimited free online stock, ETF and options trades. Anyone else who opens a new You Invest Trade account will get unlimited free trades for one year.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been seeing a nice uptake from our Chase client base - mostly younger and first-time investors,” Keough said by phone.</p>
      <p>On average, she said, You Invest Trade investors are over 15 years younger than clients of other investing divisions at the bank.</p>
      <p>The bank declined to provide data on assets under management or number of clients for You Invest.</p>
