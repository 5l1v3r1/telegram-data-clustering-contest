      <p><a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/how-to-make-siri-quiet-at-night-on-homepod/">Great idea by Matthew Cassinelli</a>: using the new <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/hands-on-with-homepods-new-music-features-for-homekit-shortcuts-and-handoff/">HomePod and AirPlay 2 actions for home automation</a> in iOS 13.2, it is possible to automate a HomePod’s volume level (including its Siri responses) throughout the day.</p>
      <blockquote>But one of the nagging problems with HomePod is the way Siri, regardless of the current time of day, will respond loudly at whatever volume you’ve previously set. <br/><br/>Whether it’s the middle of the night or super early in the morning, it’s all too common to ask Siri something and the answer shouted backed at you, only because you listened to music loudly sometime yesterday. Hopefully nobody wakes up, you curse at how dumb your supposedly “smart” speaker can be, and frantically try to turn it down. <br/><br/>Thankfully, iOS 13.2 provides a route to a solution by adding HomePods and AppleTV to scenes and automations – the HomePod didn’t fix this on its own, but, with a Home Automation, you can make it “smart” enough yourself.</blockquote>
      <p>As I <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/hands-on-with-homepods-new-music-features-for-homekit-shortcuts-and-handoff/">explained</a> when iOS 13.2 came out, you can put together these automations by using the ‘Adjust Audio Only’ option after selecting a HomePod or compatible AirPlay 2 speaker in the Home app. I just set this up for my three HomePods and Sonos One, and, sure enough, at 11:20 PM, volume was set to 15% on all my speakers (it should be raised back up to 50% tomorrow at noon).</p>
      <p>In theory, I would like to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/17/#home-automation">turn this automation into a shortcut</a> and add a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pushcut-automate-shortcuts/id1450936447">Pushcut</a> notification to confirm the volume change (and optionally shuffle a playlist by <a href="https://www.pushcut.io/guides/homekit.html">choosing a HomeKit scene</a> from the notification’s actions). There’s a bug that prevents me from doing this in the latest iOS 13.3 beta, but I’ll keep it in mind for the future.</p>
