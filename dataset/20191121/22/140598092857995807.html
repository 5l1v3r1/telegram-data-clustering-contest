      <h1>Russian officials accused of obstruction in Danil Lysenko investigation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:18:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/press-association/" target="_blank">Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Russian athletics federation officials have been charged with obstructing an investigation into a whereabouts failure by high jumper Danil Lysenko.</p>
      <p>The Athletics Integrity Unit announced on Thursday that the Russian federation (RusAf) was alleged to have committed “serious breaches” of anti-doping rules, and that its officials “had been involved in the provision of false explanations and forged documents” to the AIU.</p>
      <p>The AIU said a number of officials, including RusAf president Dmitry Shlyakhtin, along with the athlete and his coach, had been charged with tampering and/or complicity under the anti-doping rules and had been provisionally suspended.</p>
      <p>The charges have been brought following a 15-month investigation, which was conducted with the assistance of Russia’s national anti-doping agency, Rusada.</p>
      <p>Lysenko, 22, won a silver medal when he competed as a neutral athlete at the 2017 World Championships in London, with the Russian federation already suspended by World Athletics since November 2015.</p>
      <p>Lysenko’s neutral athlete status was revoked by World Athletics last year over the failure to provide whereabouts information. RusAf has until Dec 12 to respond to the charges.</p>
      <p>Lysenko was notified of his third whereabouts failure on June 25, 2018. Three missed tests and/or filing failures within a 12-month period constitute a breach of the anti-doping regulations.</p>
      <p>An AIU investigation concluded that the explanations given by Lysenko for his whereabouts failures were false and supported by forged documents, which then sparked a follow-up probe.</p>
      <p>The AIU then interviewed 22 witnesses between April and November of this year, and conducted extensive digital forensic analysis as well as translating more than 7,000 documents from Russian to English.</p>
      <p>The charges are yet another setback for the reputation of Russian sport. The World Anti-Doping Agency’s executive committee is set to consider a formal recommendation from its independent compliance review committee regarding Rusada on Dec 9.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the CRC will recommend Rusada be declared non-compliant with anti-doping regulations over “inconsistencies” in laboratory data obtained under the terms of Russia’s reinstatement to compliance in September 2018.</p>
      <p>If the executive committee endorses that recommendation then it could ultimately lead to serious sanctions being issued by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, including barring Russia from competing in or hosting international sporting events.</p>
