      <p>General Motors is recalling more than half a million Chevrolet and GMC light- and heavy-duty pickup trucks because of concerns that seat belt pretensioners, when deployed to tighten belts amid a collision, could lead to a fire.</p>
      <p>The hot gases expelled by the pretensioners could travel through a hole in the seat belt bracket and ignite cotton material in the carpet. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the driver may see smoke or smell a burning odor after a collision, before a fire becomes visible.</p>
      <p>This affects certain 2019 to 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500, and 2020 Silverado 2500, Silverado 3500, Sierra 2500, and Sierra 3500 trucks. Models with vinyl flooring are not included in the recall.</p>
      <p>A correction was put in place on the assembly line, which is why not every carpeted truck will be recalled.</p>
      <p>Dealerships have been notified, and the automaker will contact owners soon. </p>
      <h3>The Details</h3>
      <p><b>Vehicles recalled:</b> 556,399 Chevrolet and GMC light- and heavy-duty pickup trucks from the 2019 and 2020 model years, including certain 2019 to 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500, and 2020 Silverado 2500, Silverado 3500, Sierra 2500, and Sierra 3500 models.</p>
      <p><b>The problem:</b> There is a risk that when the front seat belt pretensioners deploy, gases could ignite the carpet.</p>
      <p><b>The fix:</b> Dealers will seal the hole in the seat belt bracket, at no charge.</p>
      <p><b>How to contact the manufacturer:</b> Owners may contact Chevrolet customer service at 800-222-1020 or GMC customer service at 888-988-7267.</p>
      <p><b>NHTSA campaign number:</b> 19V814000. GM’s number for this recall is N192270600.</p>
      <p><b>Check to see whether your vehicle has an open recall: </b>NHTSA’s website will tell you whether your vehicle has a recall that needs to be addressed.</p>
      <p>If you plug your car’s 17-digit vehicle identification number (VIN) into NHTSA’s website and a recall doesn’t appear, it means your vehicle doesn’t currently have one. Because automakers issue recalls often, and for many older vehicles, we recommend checking back regularly.</p>
