      <p>Maurico Pochettino left an emotional message to his Tottenham players on a tactics board in the changing room after his shock sacking.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's stint at the club came to an abrupt end on Tuesday night when he was removed from his post and replaced by Jose Mourinho the very next morning.</p>
      <p>Tributes for the Argentinian, who guided the club to the Champions League final last season, poured in from players.</p>
      <p>And his assistant, Jesus Perez, has now posted pictures of him writing a heartfelt message on the tactics board for his players after not getting the chance to say his farewells in person.</p>

      <p>"Big thanks to you all!" Pochettino wrote.</p>
      <p>"We can't say goodbye...you will always be in our hearts."</p>
      <p>He then signed the board, with Perez posting it on social media and simply stating "COYS" with a love heart emoji.</p>

      <p>"We’ve had some amazing moments in the last 5 and a half years that I will never forget. You were my manager but my friend as well and I thank you for that relationship.</p>

      <p>“I do it with a bit of sadness but I have to speak about Mauricio," said Mourinho.</p>
      <p>"I have to congratulate him for the work he has done. This club will always be his home. This training ground will always be his training ground. The door will always be open for him.</p>
      <p>"He can come when he wants. When he miss the players, when he miss the people he work with. The door is always open for him. "He will find happiness again. He will find a great club again. He will have a great future."</p>
