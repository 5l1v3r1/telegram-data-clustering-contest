      <p><b>PHILADELPHIAÂ (AP)</b> - Officials say two Philadelphia police officers and a transit authority employee have been charged in two separate investigations.</p>
      <p>The city's district attorney's office announced the charges Thursday.</p>

      <p>Philadelphia Police Homicide Det. Nathaniel Williams, Edward's brother, was also arrested in the same investigation. He's been charged with records and evidence tampering, lying to authorities and obstruction.</p>
      <p>Specific information on the pending investigations was not released.</p>
      <p>Attorney information couldn't be found for any of the men charged.</p>
