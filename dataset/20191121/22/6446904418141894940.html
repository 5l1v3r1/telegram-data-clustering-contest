      <p>HEADSTONES HAVE BEEN unveiled at the last three unmarked graves of those killed in the 1920 Bloody Sunday shootings at Croke Park.</p>
      <p>The GAA organised the commemorative stones in Glasnevin Cemetery on the 99th anniversary of the killings.</p>
      <p>Eight of the 14 people killed by British soldiers at the historic GAA ground in Dublin were laid to rest in unmarked graves.</p>
      <p>Since 2015, the Bloody Sunday Graves Project has been working with the surviving relatives of these victims to see the graves marked.</p>
      <p>On Thursday morning, headstones were unveiled for Jerome O’Leary, 10, the youngest of the victims, as well as for labourer Patrick O’Dowd, 57, and former soldier Michael Feery, 40.</p>
      <p>On November 21 1920, British soldiers opened fire in Croke Park during a football match between Dublin and Tipperary.</p>
      <p>Fourteen were killed and dozens others injured.</p>
      <p>It came hours after the killing of 14 men by the IRA in an operation targeting British agents.</p>
      <p>Almost a century on, members of the victims’ families were present alongside GAA president John Horan for the unveiling ceremony.</p>
      <p>Liam Dineen, a relative of Mr O’Dowd, described the ceremony as poignant and fitting.</p>
      <p>His great-uncle is recalled heroically as having helped others escape over a wall before being shot himself.</p>
      <p>“We are very proud as a family that his courage is recognised,” he said.</p>
      <p>“My aunt always spoke about her dad and the time growing up when she had lost a young brother and lost her father. She always regretted the fact that nothing had been done or said in his memory.</p>
      <p>“It gives me a mark of closure for my aunt that at long last her father’s sacrifice has been noted and appreciated.</p>
      <p>“So two years ago when the GAA approached me (about installing a headstone), I said ‘of course, I’d be delighted’, I know that it would be a tribute to my aunt as well that this was being done.</p>
      <p>“It was very fitting and very appropriate.”</p>
