      <p>A Delhi court on Thursday allowed the Enforcement Directorate to interrogate senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram in Tihar jail for two days in the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/chidambaram-inx-media-scam-case-explained-karti-5921402/">INX Media</a> money-laundering case, which is being probed by the ED.</p>
      <p>Special Judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar passed the order on a plea filed by the agency, which was represented by central government standing counsel Amit Mahajan and special public prosecutor N K Matta.</p>
      <p>The court allowed the ED to interrogate Chidambaram on November 22 and 23 from 10 am to 3 pm.</p>
      <p>In its plea, the ED sought the court’s permission to record Chidambaram’s statement under Section 50 of PMLA.<br/>“The agency submitted that it wants to confront Chidambaram with crucial documents which are in possession of the DoE and same would enable DoE to ascertain and unearth the relevant aspects of the case,” the order read.</p>
      <p>The ED told the court that Chidambaram’s custodial interrogation was essential for ascertaining the complex money trail apart from the involvement of the other accused. The court had earlier extended Chidambaram’s judicial custody till November 27.</p>
