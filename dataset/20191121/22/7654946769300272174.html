      <p>Blue Lives Matter NYC presented the family of fallen NYPD officer Brian Mulkeen with a check for $40,000 on Thursday — as a way to let them know the cop’s blue family won’t forget him.</p>
      <p>“The family was so appreciative… They were so blown away,” said Sgt. Joe Imperatrice of Blue Lives Matter.</p>
      <p>“They can use it for whatever they need, it was just something so they know nationwide we were thinking about them and won’t forget their son.”</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old police officer was killed by friendly fire in late September during a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/29/hero-cop-killed-in-bronx-during-hand-to-hand-struggle-with-armed-suspect/">hand-to-hand struggle</a> with an armed suspect struggle in The Bronx.</p>
      <p>The group set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/nypd-officer-brian-mulkeen">GoFundMe</a> account and raised money through T-shirt sales to help honor their fallen brother.</p>
      <p>“No matter how much time ellipses, it still painful, but what helps, is knowing people care,” Imperatrice said.</p>
