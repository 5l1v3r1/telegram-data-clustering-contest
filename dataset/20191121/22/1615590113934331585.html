      <h1>Blizzard, NetEase win $569k in copyright suit against Chinese mobile publisher</h1>
      <h2>4399 Network found to have violated copyrights of Overwatch with Gunplay Battlefront, Heroes of Warfare</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1808" target="_blank">Rebekah Valentine</a></address>
      <p>Blizzard and NetEase have recently won a copyright lawsuit against Xiamen-based publisher 4399 Network, which was found to have copied Overwatch with at least two of its titles.</p>
      <p>Shanghai publication <a href="https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1911136007/">Shine reports</a> that a Pudong court ruled in favor of Blizzard and NetEase to the tune of nearly four million yuan ($569,000) in the suit. The majority of that compensation was for a mobile game that Shine refers to as Clash of Fighters, but is very likely the same as mobile MOBA Heroes of Warfare, which Blizzard and NetEase originally sued 4399 over <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/13/overwatch-china-infringement/">in 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>500,000 yuan in compensation was received for the online game Gunplay Battlefront, with a lesser amount agreed upon since the game has been offline since 2017.</p>
      <p>Blizzard and NetEase argued that the two games included character designs, gameplay, maps, and other elements that were extremely similar to Overwatch, which NetEase has published in China.</p>
