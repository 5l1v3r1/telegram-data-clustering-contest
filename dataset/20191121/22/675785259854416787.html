      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:13:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cheryl">Cheryl</a> is teaching her toddler son Bear - who is two - to meditate with her before bedtime after falling in love with an app.</p>
      <p>The Geordie sweetheart, 36, who shares her son with ex flame <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liam-payne">Liam Payne</a> , 26, revealed she loves to use the app Insight Timer for herself and Bear in his nighttime routine.</p>
      <p>Former Girls Aloud star Cheryl told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10394159/cheryl-teaching-bear-meditate-rescue-turtles/">The Sun</a> : "I like to meditate, I actually use an app called Insight Timer. I really love it."</p>
      <p>Talking about her new experience with their meditation routine, Cheryl confessed the updated version has a kids section which reads stories to Bear and she admits he's hooked.</p>
      <p>Chezza, a judge on upcoming BBC1 talent show The Greatest Dancer, stated she wasn't pushing her son into the showbiz world, despite him having famous parents.</p>
      <p>Speaking on RuPaul: What's the Tee? podcast, after she appeared on the panel of BBC3's RuPaul's Drag Race UK, she said: "We don't check in enough. Intuition. I'm preparing him. I hope he becomes an earth boy rescuing turtles in Barbados."</p>

      <p>She added: "You look at every child star and they're all f***ed up. Name me two who aren't, you'll struggle to find them."</p>
      <p>Cheryl's co-star Nadine Coyle is currently on I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>She has been accused of 'lying' about her 'friendship' with her former Girls Aloud bandmate.</p>

      <p>The Irish singer opened up about her time in the girl band during an intimate chat with Adele Roberts and Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>When the ex-EastEnders star asked if she got on with everyone in Girls Aloud, Nadine said: "Yes."</p>
      <p>Digging deeper, Jacqueline admitted she had heard Nadine "didn't get on with Cheryl".</p>

      <p>Tense Nadine insisted it was "fake news" - but I'm A Celebrity viewers pointed out this went against what she had claimed before.</p>
      <p>Nadine previously blamed the rest of the girls for splitting the band - and even insisted there was never any friendship with Cheryl.</p>
      <p>Despite having been a bridesmaid at Cheryl's lavish 2006 wedding to footballer Ashley Cole - Nadine insisted they'd never been friends at all.</p>
      <p>On Celebrity Juice in 2018, Nadine said: "There was no falling out, there was just no friendship to begin with."</p>
