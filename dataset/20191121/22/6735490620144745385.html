      <p>The “Unforgettable” rapper was admitted to a San Fernando Valley hospital in Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon, according to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/21/french-montana-hospitalized-heart-rate-elevated-stomach-pain/"><i>TMZ</i></a>. L.A. County Sheriff’s deputies were allegedly called to Montana’s Calabasas home due to a possible robbery.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/french-montana-hospitalized-in-los-angeles-136884"><i>ET</i></a> that robbery is said to have been a false alarm. But when the cops arrived they were concerned with Montana’s odd behaviour. Sources reportedly told <i>TMZ</i> that Montana has been “suffering severe stomach pains, nausea and perhaps most alarmingly, an elevated heart rate.”</p>
      <p>Another rep for the LA County Sheriff’s Office adds that there was a medical call made on site and that a person was transported to a hospital.</p>
      <p>Montana, 35, is said to now be awake and alert. He is receiving IV fluids and rumours suggest contaminated food may be responsible for his worrying health.</p>
