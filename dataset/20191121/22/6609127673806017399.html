        <b>UNDER-fire ScotRail will dump sewage onto tracks next year even though the practice should have been flushed out two years ago.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nine old trains will drop human waste on lines in 2020 it emerged due to delays on carriages equipped with “retention tanks”.</p>

      <p>Union bosses have slammed the firm over fears track workers could get sick from the poo.</p>
      <p>ScotRail ended the process in 2017 but reintroduced old stock as a stop-gap due to a new fleet of refurbed InterCity trains being postponed.</p>
      <p>The RMT union’s organiser Mick Hogg said: “We’re livid this promise has been broken.</p>
      <p>“Why should our members be subjected to these disgusting conditions, being spra-yed by foul waste, as they do their work.”</p>
      <p>All UK rail operators were meant to halt the practice by 2020 but ScotRail blamed suppliers after they admitted they will miss the deadline.</p>
      <p>Tory Jamie Greene said: “It’s important we consider the impact this has on the track workers and the wider effects on the environment.”</p>

      <p>The Dutch-based firm — who’ve got flak over delays, cancellations and service — was meant to have 26 renovated trains by December 2018. But only eight arrived.</p>
      <p>ScotRail spokesman said: “We’re working with suppliers to ensure our fleet’s completed as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>Network Rail added: “There are a few companies given a bit more time. We are tracking their actions closely.”</p>
      <p>We told last month how ScotRail bosses apologised after a passenger complained about <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4885153/scotrail-boss-alex-hynes-human-zoo/">"human zoo" toilets</a> on the trains.</p>
      <p>Scottish Labour said ScotRail had <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4781690/scottish-labour-scotrail-cancelled-75000-trains-abellio-takeover/">cancelled 75,000 trains</a> since Abellio took over.</p>
