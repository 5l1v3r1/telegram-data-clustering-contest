      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> previously revealed that she didn’t know who her fellow campmates were before she entered the jungle – but now she’s done it again.</p>
      <p>As actors Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi made their debut on the show with their first bushtucker trial, the 70-year-old admitted she didn’t who they were – while throwing shade at soap stars at the same time.</p>
      <p>She asked as she pointed at the poster of the duo: ‘Does anyone know who they are?’</p>
      <p>Roman responded: ‘You know the one on the left it’s a guy from Coronation Street which is another big soap in the UK.’</p>
      <p>‘What’s the deal with all these f***ing soap people?’</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa then piped up with ‘Oi’.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn was quick to apologise as she added: ‘Oh sorry.’</p>

      <p>This then left Roman in fits of laugher although former EastEnders actress Jacqueline didn’t look impressed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-awkwardness-caitlyn-jenner-admits-doesnt-know-uk-celebs-11172779/">It’s not the first time this has happened because on the very first episode,</a> as Caitlyn was greeted by everyone – she didn’t have a clue who they were.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline got to the point by saying: ‘You have no clue who anyone is.’</p>
      <p>She confessed: ‘No I don’t but we’re gonna have a lot of time to talk.’</p>
