      <p>Celebrities can’t travel back in time a la “Back To The Future” to meet their younger selves — but one Dutch artist is offering the next best thing: flawless photos of stars “posing” with their fresh faces of yesteryear.</p>
      <p>Want to see “John Wick”-era Keanu Reeves <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1zMOnxIo_5/">rubbing elbows</a> with his mop-topped teen facsimile from “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure”? Simply head to  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ardgelinck/">Ard Gelinck’s Instagram</a>, where you’ll find a compendium of superimposed snaps featuring A-listers from Jennifer Aniston to Robin Williams.</p>
      <p>And while his side-by-sides might seem like they split the space-time continuum, Gelinck achieved his increasingly viral feat using plain old Photoshop — and lots of practice.</p>
      <p>Check out some of his doppelgänger handiwork.</p>

      <p>This birthday tribute to late great comedian/actor Robin Williams perfectly juxtaposes the older, straight-laced Williams with the irrepressible wild-man of his youth.</p>

      <p>Although it doesn’t hold a candle to this mind-melting side-by-side of old and young David Bowie, who died three years ago of liver cancer.</p>

      <p>Is it just us or did young Tom Selleck bear an uncanny resemblance to porn star Ron Jeremy?</p>

      <p>Like a fine wine, it’s safe to say George Clooney got better with age.</p>

      <p>Gelinck’s photographic fountain of youth sometimes even pairs celebs with their kid selves. Here’s one of talk show host Conan O’Brien buddying up with his freckle-faced younger self.</p>

      <p>And if that didn’t blow your mind, we submit rapper Marshall Mathers with an “Eminem mini.”</p>

      <p>Sometimes Gelinck poses actors with the characters that launched them to stardom. Check out comedian Jim Carrey with Lloyd Christmas, his dim-witted alter-ego from “Dumb and Dumber.”</p>

      <p>Just like he did during the iconic last scene in “Big,” Tom Hanks gets to look upon his more youthful iteration — this time the titular character from Forrest Gump.</p>

      <p>Sylvester Stallone seamlessly shakes hands with the Italian Stallion — Rocky Balboa of the “Rocky” franchise.</p>

      <p>And what better way to celebrate the 25th anniversary of “Friends” than by putting Jennifer Aniston and company face-to-face with their characters from a quarter century ago.</p>

      <p>Some photos even collapsed the age gap entirely. By popular fan request, here are Heath Ledger, above, and Joaquin Phoenix, below, immaculately superimposed with their respective Jokers from, well, basically yesterday.</p>

      <p>A creative mind since childhood, <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/celebrity/artist-creates-incredible-pictures-of-celebrities-posing-with-their-younger-selves/">Gelinck told Unilad</a> that he’d been posting photos for 10 years. However, he’s only gone viral recently (thanks in part to celebs sharing his creations), racking up more than 200,000 followers on Instagram.</p>
