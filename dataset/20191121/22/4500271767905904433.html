      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan had a telephonic conversation with US President Donald Trump on Thursday during which bilateral and regional issues were discussed, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office said.</p>
      <p>During the phone call, Prime Minister Imran termed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1517623/pm-imran-welcomes-release-of-2-hostages-by-taliban-in-afghanistan">release</a> of two Western hostages by the Taliban in Afghanistan as a "positive development", saying Pakistan was happy that the duo was safe and free.</p>
      <p>"President Trump thanked the prime minister for Pakistan’s efforts in facilitating this positive outcome," the statement said.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Imran reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the advancement of the Afghan peace and reconciliation process aimed at achieving a stable Afghanistan. Both leaders agreed to continue to work together for the promotion of this shared objective, according to the press release.</p>
      <p>The Taliban insurgents had released two hostages — Kevin King from the United States and Timothy Weeks from Australia — on Tuesday in a prisoner exchange deal with the Afghan government.</p>
      <p>The American and Australian were exchanged with three Taliban leaders, including key militant figure Anas Haqqani.</p>
      <p>The prime minister during the conversation also apprised President Trump of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1514652/indias-clampdown-in-occupied-kashmir-has-entered-its-4th-month-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">prevailing situation</a> in Indian-occupied Kashmir, where he said more than eight million people remain under siege over 100 days after New Delhi revoked the region's special autonomy.</p>
      <p>The premier appreciated President Trump’s continued engagement as well as his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute. "Prime Minister Imran Khan stressed that the President must continue his efforts for [the] facilitation of a peaceful solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute," the statement said.</p>
      <p>Recalling their meetings in Washington and New York earlier this year, Trump and Imran agreed to "deepen bilateral collaboration, including in relevant multilateral fora".</p>
      <p>The two leaders also agreed to remain in close touch, the press release added.</p>
