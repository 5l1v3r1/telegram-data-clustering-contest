      <p>The trainer who led <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a>'s workouts over the summer and before his joining the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> cold turkey on Tuesday says the forward was able to stay NBA-ready by embracing an overhaul of his game.</p>
      <p>Trainer Alex Bazzell said in an <a href="https://www.sny.tv/knicks/news/carmelo-anthonys-trainer-talks-how-he-prepared-ex-knick-to-return-with-blazers/311948090">in-depth interview with SNY</a> that they zeroed in on pushing Anthony to improve his defensive effort -- especially against the pick-and-roll -- and to make quicker decisions off the catch and move better off the ball.</p>
      <p>Bazzell was adamant the 10-time All-Star was open to change.</p>
      <p>"He was completely bought into the [idea that on] the defensive side of the ball, he's got to get better," Bazzell said. "He was bought into not being able to hold the ball [on offense]. We would still work on his mid-post because I think that's going to be a part of his game that he's going to have to rely on to score every now and then. You don't take that away, you keep all of that fresh.</p>
      <p>"When we would play one-on-one scenarios, when he'd catch, it's hard because sometimes you just have a tendency to hold it, relax and kind of let the defense make a mistake. It was just trying to break habits that he's built up for so long and he was never defensive about it. He was always 100 percent in agreement with what I was saying."</p>
      <p>Bazzell and Anthony worked from June to August in Los Angeles, and in New York before the season and before <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=401160841">his Portland debut against New Orleans</a>.</p>
      <p>"We were working on moving without the ball because that's something I saw on film he didn't do very well," Bazzell said of Anthony, who had last played Nov. 8, 2018, with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a>. "Especially coming from -- let's face it, Houston's offense is four guys standing and watching <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden">James [Harden]</a> dribble the ball for 20 seconds. It's tough. So we worked on getting used to [moving without the ball]. Getting used to the actions of catching. His footwork efficiency with rips and jabs and all of that off the catch. He's as smart a player as you're going to find. There's a reason that he's scored as many points as he has. So it was just getting him comfortable with moving in different ways than he has in the past."</p>
      <p>Bazzell said their routine consisted of three days on and one day off of workouts that lasted about an hour. Pickup sessions with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets">Nets</a> players after word came that Brooklyn had interest in Anthony also gave him a chance to stay sharp.</p>
      <p>"I think that kind of reaffirmed that he belonged in the league because he went up there and played incredible," Bazzell said.</p>
      <p>They then "crammed in everything" with five workouts in three days after Anthony agreed to the deal with the Blazers last week.</p>
      <p>"But the workouts were much more specific because I actually knew the offense of what Portland was going to run and the touches that he was going to get," Bazzell said. "The first workout was beating on his body a little bit. He'd drive and we'd put a shoulder in him. Just to see how his body was going to bounce back. And then get his cardio up."</p>
      <p>Anthony played in his second game Thursday night, a 137-129 loss to the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks">Milwaukee Bucks</a>. He scored 18 points on 6-of-15 shooting, including 3-for-5 from three, with seven rebounds, four assists and three turnovers in 29 minutes. It was an improvement over his debut performance Tuesday when he scored 10 points on 4-of-14 shooting, going 2-for-3 from 3-point range with four rebounds and five turnovers in 24 minutes.</p>
