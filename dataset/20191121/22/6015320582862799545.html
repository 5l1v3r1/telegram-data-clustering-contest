      <p>The Taliban group reacted to assassination of political analyst Waheed Muzhda by unknown gunmen in Kabul city, blaming the ‘intelligence circles of the enemy’ for his killing.</p>
      <p>The Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid in a statement said the group condemns the assassination of Mr. Muzhda in strongest terms.</p>
      <p>Without elaborating further about his claims and the circles involved in the assassination, Mujahid went on to claim that the assassination of Mr. Muzhda unmasks the true faces, reality and resolve of those who recently assassinated various political analysts, researchers and cadres under the guise of supporting the freedom of speech.</p>
      <p>Unknown gunmen riding a motorcycle assassinated Mr. Muzhda at around 5 pm local time on Wednesday in West of Kabul city.</p>
      <p>No individual or group has so far claimed responsibility for the assassination of Mr. Muzhda.</p>
