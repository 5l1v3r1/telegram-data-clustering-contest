      <p> </p>
      <p>Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is an extremely painful and life-threatening experience. Razors, knives and strings often unsterilised are used to remove their external sexual organs, either partially or completely. This frequently leads to painful inflammation.</p>
      <p>While some girls bleed to death, others who survived suffered physical, emotional and mental pains for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p>In Ekiti State, it has become frightening despite the promulgation of a legal framework criminalising the practice. Unfortunately, many erroneously perceived the practice as a social norm.</p>
      <p>Despite international outcries against the endemic problem of female genital mutilation, the practice is still on the increase in Ekiti. At the same time, some communities still practice mutilation on teenagers and adults.</p>
      <p>In an effort to end the practice, wife of Ekiti State Governor Mrs Bisi Fayemi embarked on sensitisation tour to the 16 local government areas to raise awareness among the people towards persuading them to appreciate the need to end the dehumanising practice.</p>
      <p>During the the September 9 tour, hundreds of practitioners of FGM surrendered their instruments, which included gleaming knives, razors and calabashes to Mrs Fayemi in exchange of viable empowerment programme.</p>
      <p>The repentant practitioners were made to embrace empowerment packages as alternatives to the ancient practice and in a way to make ends meet.</p>
      <p>Mrs Fayemi praised the women for renouncing the obsolete practice, even as she said the state government is determined to step up its war against rape, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), child slavery and open defecation that have constituted a national shame to the state.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Fayemi lamented that Ekiti was ranked first in open defecation and third in female genital mutilation practices in the country.</p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
        <b>Mrs Fayemi said: “A situation where women’s reproductive organs are butchered in the name of cultural practice is no longer fashionable and acceptable. The horrible practice had brought a lot of sexual damage to women through infectious diseases that destroy body sexual nerve cells, thereby causing marital crises in many homes.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>She insisted that rapists and those obstructing justice in the trials of sex offenders will continue to face the wrath of the law under the Governor Kayode Fayemi-led administration.</p>
      <p>She added that it was shameful for Ekiti to be leading in Female Genital Mutilation and open defecation in the country, saying such must stop.</p>
      <p>“It is a shameful thing for Ekiti to be ranked third in female genital mutilation. This is unacceptable to us.</p>
      <p>“In open defecation, Ekiti came first in Nigeria. Let us stop the practice, because it endangers our lives. The government will soon provide toilet facilities across the state.</p>
      <p>“The essence of this tour is to engage in advocacy, because we need to pay more attention to the health of our women.</p>
      <p>“Those who are of child-bearing age should go to hospital for medical care. Ten thousand delivery packs (Mama Kit) have been provided for distribution to expectant mothers.</p>
      <p>“The issue of gender violence is also of concern to us. Husbands should not beat their wives. If you are beaten by your husbands, report to the nearest police station. We have a law that prohibits that. Don’t wait until you are killed.</p>
      <p>“If someone defiled any child and you come to beg, the person will be treated as an accomplice”, she warned.</p>
      <p>Besides her advocacy and activism, Mrs Fayemi has shown commitment to give succour to the downtrodden masses that are helpless and hopeless.</p>
      <p>Materials distributed to the elderly (Onje Arugbo) at the event included cash, grinding machines, sewing machines, hair dryers, cooking gas, coolers and food stuffs.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) has commended the state government for its effort to end FGM practice in the state, but suggested the need for legal and policy backing from the state government to curb the harmful practice.</p>
      <p>The UNICEF Consultant on FGM/C, Mrs Aderonke Olutayo, identified cultural and traditional beliefs as being responsible for the practice, noting that some people saw it as a family heritage, “but we must stop it.</p>
      <p>“Some of those who carry out genital mutilation are unskilled; they do it with primitive and unsterilised equipment, thereby causing damage to them.</p>
      <p>“The World Health Organisation has a law prohibiting this practice and it has been domesticated in Nigeria, particularly in Ekiti State.</p>
      <p>“I want to appeal that the laws should be implemented to protect the lives of our women,” she said.</p>
      <p>She urged everyone to see the campaign against FGM as an activism to rescue women from an unprofitable traditional practice, even as she urged stakeholders to mobilise and eliminate the practice.</p>
      <p>The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Moji Yaya-Kolade, said the FGM, which was prevalent in the rural areas must be nipped in the bud with concerted efforts from officials of Primary Health Care because of their proximity to the grassroots.</p>
      <p>She said over 72 per cent cases were reported in Ekiti, ranking the state high in the prevalence of the harmful practice. She advised stakeholders to join in the campaign against the act.</p>
      <p>Yaya-Kolade pointed out that FGM had done more harm to women, saying that the victims were either carrying lifetime infectious diseases such as HIV, barrenness, hemorrhage or broken homes due to sexual non-satisfaction and other associated problems due to the cutting of their genitals.</p>
      <p>The commissioner further explained that the state had domesticated the law banning the practice and warned that anyone caught still engaging in the practice would be prosecuted.</p>
      <p>She urged the womenfolk, who he described as “the real victims” to intensify their campaign against cutting of the female genitals to create more awareness.</p>
      <p>The Commissioner for Women Affairs, Mrs Mojisola Fafure, commended Mrs Fayemi for leading the fight to end the myths that perpetrate the violation of the fundamental rights of women with intensive campaign against the harmful practices.</p>
      <p>She said the community campaign and empowerment package was an indication that Governor Fayemi was passionate about issues that affect women.</p>
