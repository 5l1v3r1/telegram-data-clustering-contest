      <h1>Meralco spending ₱1 B for 3rd smart substation</h1>

      <p>Power utility giant Manila Electric Company (Meralco) has rolled out ₱1.0 billion worth of investment for its third “smart substation” that will address load growth in areas straddling key business growth havens and the premiere townships of Pasig and Quezon City in Metro Manila.</p>
      <p>According to Meralco Senior Vice President and Head of Networks Ronnie L. Aperocho, the utility firm’s newly commercially-commenced Bridgetowne substation forms part of the company’s smart grid journey – and this venture will have several follow-through in various parts of Metro Manila.</p>
      <p>The other projects in the company’s blueprint include those in Eton Centris in Quezon City, Net Park in Fort Bonifacio, the Arca South development in Taguig and the Escoda substation in Manila, which is near Malacañang Palace, the official seat of leadership of the country.</p>
      <p>“This is our third smart substation,” Aperocho emphasized, while adding that the first two had been its Valencia substation in San Juan; and the other one is in an area of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) domain in Pasay City.</p>
      <p>“We still have more projects for implementation after this,” he added, with him stressing that the targeted completion will be until end of next year.</p>
      <p>The Bridgetowne substation is a fully automated gas insulated switchgear (GIS) facility – and for the first transformer that had already been installed at the substation, that already called for aggregate investment of ₱550 million to ₱650 million; while the total could reach ₱1.0 billion when the second transformer is set up.</p>
      <p>Meralco President and CEO Ray C. Espinosa noted that this project will address the load growth of end-users in areas to be catered to by the substation for the next 10 years or until 2030.</p>
      <p>In the vicinity of the substation facility itself is a 31-hectare property development project of Robinsons Land Corporation made up of mixed-use residential condominiums, office buildings, shopping centers, a five-star hotel as well as parks, school, hospital and public art installation.</p>
      <p>The facility is a 115-kilovolt to 34.5kV facility, with an initial capacity of 83-megavolt ampere (MVA) and is sited in a 1,293-square meter property provided by Robinsons Land of the Gokongwei group.</p>
