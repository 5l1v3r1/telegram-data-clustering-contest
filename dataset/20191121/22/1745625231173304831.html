      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/jamie-lynn-spears/">Jamie Lynn Spears</a> will return to <i>All That</i> on Nickelodeon to be part of an upcoming <i>Zoey 101</i> reunion, reports <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/21/jamie-lynn-spears-reuniting-zoey-101-cast-all-that/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>.</p>
      <p>While this event isn’t the first time the cast of<i> Zoey 101</i> has reunited, never before has Spears been involved. Now it looks like she is making up for the lost time by ensuring she gets a chance to do something special with her former co-stars.</p>
      <p>Last year, Spears briefly appeared on Nickelodeon as part of the <i>Double Dare</i> revival series. This time, she’ll be coming back alongside several of her <i>Zoey 101</i> cast mates.</p>
      <p>After the incredible debut of Disney Plus, Nickelodeon has been stepping up its game in the arena of nostalgic fanfare. <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5742362/netflix-signs-multi-year-deal-nickelodeon/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> previously reported that the network signed a multi-year deal with Netflix to develop new content for popular Nick shows like <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> and <i>Invader Zim</i>.</p>
      <p>Given the persistent popularity of <i>Zoey 101</i>, it’s not surprising the network would want to do something special for its devoted followers.</p>
      <p>Not only will Spears get a chance to pal around with her old friends, but <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> states that she will reprise her role as former<i> All That</i> character, Thelma Stump, “the bacon-loving bodyguard,” in a new sketch.</p>
      <p>The article confirms former <i>Zoey 101</i> actors Paul Butcher, Christopher Massey, Kristin Herrera, Erin Sanders, Sean Flynn, and Matthew Underwood are set to appear as well. Noticeably absent from that line-up is Victoria Justice, who joined<i> Zoey 101</i> in its second season and also starred in another Nickelodeon series, <i>Victorious</i>.</p>
      <p>Some of Justice’s fans appear disappointed by the star’s lack of involvement. Several people mentioned the actress’s official Twitter and Instagram accounts in the hopes she might explain her absence.</p>
      <p>“Hype!!! Where’s Vic though?” questioned a fan.</p>
      <p>However, there is still time before the episode premieres. It is possible that Justice could still be part of it.</p>
      <p>The younger Spears sister shared the exciting news on her Instagram earlier today.</p>

      <p>“I’m crying tears of happiness,” said one fan.</p>
      <p>“‘LIZZIE MCGUIRE’ AND ‘ZOEY 101’ IN ONE YEAR. I CANNOT HANDLE THIS,” exclaimed another ecstatic user.</p>
      <p>“Omg I’m crying my childhood is back,” a third follower commented.</p>
      <p>The exact date of the upcoming <i>All That</i> episode featuring the former Pacific Coast Academy students has yet to be announced but <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> reports it will air sometime in the early months of 2020.</p>
      <p>New episodes of <i>All That</i> currently air on Saturday nights at 8:30 p.m. ET on Nickelodeon.</p>
