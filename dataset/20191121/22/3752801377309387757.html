      <h1>Parliament bids farewell to first woman Serjeant-at-Arms</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:11:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">Canny Maphanga</a></address>
      <p>Members of the National Assembly gathered in Parliament to bid farewell to the first woman Serjeant-at-Arms, Regina Mohlomi, who will retire at the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>Mohlomi served eight years in this position, which included being the official guardian of the mace, a decorated rod which is the Speaker of the National Assembly's symbol of authority.</p>
      <p>"She was also responsible for maintaining the attendance register of members in the House and order in the House," parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Members of the National Assembly took turns to laud Mohlomi.</p>
      <p>House chairperson Mmatlala Boroto, who was first in line, said: "The responsibility to carry the mace required a South African who understood and appreciated the symbols of our statehood.</p>
      <p>"The responsibility required one with the utmost regard for the authority of the House, while protecting and promoting its decorum," she added.</p>
      <p>Boroto hailed Mohlomi for not only embodying the values and ideals represented by the House, but for living it and continuing to demonstrate them in her words and deeds.</p>
      <p>The EFF remembered Mohlomi for the first day it was evicted from the House.</p>
      <p>"You approached us gently and calmly asked us to leave. You treated us with kindness and handled us with professionalism," EFF member Nazier Paulsen said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the IFP's Narend Singh wished her well, noting she had managed to change hearts and minds and "history will remember that".</p>
      <p>The UDM's Nqabayomzi Nkwankwa commended her for being able to show younger women that this job could be done.</p>
      <p>The ACDP's Steven Swart described Mohlomi as "a royal queen like her name means in Latin".</p>
      <p>Mohlomi joined Parliament in 1996 after teaching English and commerce subjects at Khanya Lesedi High School in Ratanda, Ekurhuleni.</p>
      <p>"Before joining the National Assembly table in 2003, she worked in the human resources department, was a shop steward and also chairperson of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union branch in Parliament," Mothapo said.</p>
      <p>Mohlomi's retirement will come into effect in January 2020. </p>
