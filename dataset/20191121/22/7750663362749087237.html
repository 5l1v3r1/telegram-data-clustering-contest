      <h1>How Real Madrid could line up against Real Sociedad</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> will continue their 2019-20 La Liga campaign with a home game against <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-sociedad/"><b>Real Sociedad</b></a> on Saturday night.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>'s side are currently second in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/la-liga/table.html">the table</a> with 25 points from their 12 matches, level with Barcelona heading into the latest set of fixtures.</p>
      <p>Madrid will also bring a two-game winning run into this contest having beaten Galatasaray and Eibar in their last two matches, scoring 10 times in the process and conceding zero.</p>
      <p>The capital giants are the favourites to triumph on Saturday night, but Sociedad are just two points behind in fifth spot after a strong start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how Madrid could line up on Saturday night.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-asensio/"><b>Marco Asensio</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-rodriguez/"><b>James Rodriguez</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nacho/"><b>Nacho</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lucas-vazquez/"><b>Lucas Vazquez</b></a> (toe)</p>
      <p>Marco Asensio remains a long-term absentee for Madrid due to a knee problem, while James Rodriguez and Nacho are also on the sidelines for the capital giants.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos confirmed on Thursday that Lucas Vazquez had also joined the injury list with the Spaniard suffering a fractured toe during a gym session.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gareth-bale/"><b>Gareth Bale</b></a> has trained with Madrid upon his return from international duty, though, and it will be fascinating to see whether the Wales international is included in the squad on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The attacker is unlikely to start either way, though, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rodrygo-goes/"><b>Rodrygo Goes</b></a> expected to be given the nod alongside <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eden-hazard/"><b>Eden Hazard</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/karim-benzema/"><b>Karim Benzema</b></a> in the final third of the field.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcelo/"><b>Marcelo</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/toni-kroos/"><b>Toni Kroos</b></a> could also return to the XI having not featured against Eibar before the international break despite <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ferland-mendy/"><b>Ferland Mendy</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/federico-valverde/"><b>Federico Valverde</b></a> impressing in the four-goal success.</p>
