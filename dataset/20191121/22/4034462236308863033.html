      <h1>Changes Are Coming For The 2020 Kia Stinger</h1>
      <h2>A new trim offers more for nearly the same price.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:55:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/stinger">Kia Stinger</a> has been on the market since the 2018 model year and though it may be slightly early for a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/kia-has-a-tough-decision-to-make-about-the-stinger">mid-life refresh</a>, the South Korean automaker still has an update planned for the 2020 model year. However, this update appears to be limited only to trim packages. According to an order guide uncovered by <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/automotive-news/2020-kia-stinger-will-limit-2-0t-availability-add-gt-flair">Cars Direct</a>, the 2020 Kia Stinger will no longer offer the 2.0T Base and Premium trims. Both, instead, will be swapped out in favor of a new trim called the GT-Line that will start at $34,085 – only $100 more than the 2019 base trim.</p>
      <p>In short, Stinger buyers will receive sportier design elements for barely any extra money. The new GT-Line (not the Stinger GT pictured here) will come with a twin-scroll turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four with 255 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a ton of cool exterior upgrades such as a GT-styled grille and bumpers, 18-inch GT wheels, black chrome trim, and body-color door handles.</p>

      <p>The interior is decked out with a leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, black headliner, and even "GT-Line" embroidery on the front seats. The twin-turbo V6-powered 2019 Stinger GT begins at about $40,000 – a $6,410 premium over the new GT-Line. The outgoing 2019 Stinger 2.0T Premium does offer more features than the base trim, obviously, but still brings the price up to $40,185, which is actually $110 less than the cheapest GT.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the loss of the Premium trim means advanced safety features, such as automatic emergency braking, requires buyers to upgrade to the GT1, a trim that begins at nearly $46,000. Aside from these 2020 packaging changes for the 2.0 turbo-powered Stinger, all other mechanicals remain the same.</p>

      <p>Rear-wheel-drive continues to come standard in both engines, while all-wheel drive remains optional for both, though at a $2,200 premium. The 8-speed automatic transmission returns as well.</p>
      <p>We're expecting an official announcement from Kia to happen fairly soon, but it appears the Stinger lineup will have to wait another model year or two for any significant changes.</p>
