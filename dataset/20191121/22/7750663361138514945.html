      <p>Egyptian talisman Salah has been struggling with an ankle problem since October, which he aggravated before the international break as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a>'s men <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/liverpool-vs-man-city_game_92618.html">beat title rivals Manchester City 3-1</a>.</p>
      <p>Robertson, meanwhile, had to pull out of the Scotland squad for their recent Euro 2020 qualifiers with Cyprus and Kazakhstan after picking up a slight issue.</p>
      <p>Despite it initially looking as though they would miss out on the weekend's trip to South London, the <i>Daily Mirror</i> reports that both are in contention to feature after returning to training on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Salah and Robertson took part in the pre-contact session, with a view to both resuming full training on Friday.</p>
      <p>Should they come through Friday's session unscathed, Klopp will then be able to decide how much of a role each will have in Saturday afternoon's game.</p>
