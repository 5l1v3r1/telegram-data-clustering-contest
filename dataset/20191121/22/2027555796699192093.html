      <h1>Netanyahu indicted for bribery, fraud, breach of trust</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:22:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Israel's attorney general on Thursday formally charged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a series of corruption cases, throwing the country's paralyzed political system into further disarray and threatening the long-time leader's grip on power.</p>
      <p>Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit charged Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three different scandals. It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime. Mandelblit was set to issue a formal statement later on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Allegations against Netanyahu include suspicions he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends, offered to trade favors with a newspaper publisher and used his influence to help a wealthy telecom magnate in exchange for favorable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>The indictment does not require Netanyahu to resign but is expected to raise pressure on him to step down.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu has called the allegations part of a witchhunt, lashing out against the media, police, prosecutors and the justice system. Netanyahu was scheduled to issue a statement later on Thursday.</p>
