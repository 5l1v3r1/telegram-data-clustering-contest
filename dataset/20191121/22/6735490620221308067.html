      <p>Netflix’s hit show “The Crown” just released season three, but they have already started to film season four which means the cast will be replaced very soon.</p>
      <p>Producers of the show made the choice to recast the show every two seasons to deal with the ageing of the characters in real life and some reports suggest Imelda Staunton has landed the top role as Queen Elizabeth.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7712637/Imelda-Staunton-Claire-Foy-Olivia-Colman-Crown.html"><i>The Daily Mail</i></a>, Staunton will take over from Olivia Colman who played Her Majesty in season three and four after Claire Foy held the part in the first two seasons.</p>
      <p>However, Netflix has denied Staunton has been cast.</p>
      <p>“We are currently filming season 4 of ‘The Crown’ but have not commissioned any further seasons as yet, therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation,” a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/netflix-addresses-reports-imelda-staunton-cast-the-crown-1202792657/"><i>Deadline</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Staunton is best known for her role as Professor Umbridge in the “Harry Potter” franchise as well as Lady Maud Bagshaw in the “Downton Abbey” film.</p>

      <p>While fans won’t get to see Staunton (or whoever lands the role) until season five, Gillian Anderson will make her debut in season four as Margaret Thatcher, along with Emma Corrin as Lady Diana Spencer (later to become Princess Diana).</p>
