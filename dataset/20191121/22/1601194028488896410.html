      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/west-ham-united">West Ham United</a> host <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/tottenham-hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> at the London Stadium and all eyes will be on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a>, who returns to the dugout eleven months after his sacking at Manchester United. In what has been a whirlwind few days for Spurs and their fans, the two-time Champions League winner took over the reins from Mauricio Pochettino after the club reluctantly decided to part ways with the Argentine.</p>
      <p>Both sides have been underwhelming in recent weeks and although the North London club will be buoyed on by the fact that they've got a new manager at the helm, the Hammers will not be pushovers as they aim to pile on Spurs' misery domestically.</p>
      <p>The home side are only one point below Spurs in 16th place despite starting the season strongly and will look to get their season back on track with a positive result, as the Special One prepares to take charge of his first game at the club.</p>

      <h3>West Ham v Tottenham Hotspur Predicted XI</h3>
      <p><b>Tottenham Predicted XI (4-4-2):</b> Paulo Gazzaniga, Serge Aurier, Toby Alderweireld, Davinson Sanchez, Danny Rose, Eric Dier, Harry Winks, Moussa Sissoko, Dele Alli, Heung-Min Son, Harry Kane</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>West Ham v Tottenham Hotspur Prediction</h3>
      <p>Although both sides have made underwhelming starts to the league campaign and are winless in their last 5 Premier League encounters, a new manager's arrival often coincides with an upturn of form and Spurs will be hoping that's the case, as Mourinho looks to get off the mark in style. Harry Kane has scored 28 goals in 45 London Derbies and the Englishman will look to lead from the front once again.</p>
      <p><b>Verdict</b> - West Ham United 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur</p>
