      <p>BENGALURU: Ongoing investigations in what police said is a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Karnataka-Premier-League">Karnataka Premier League</a> (kpl) <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/match-fixing">match-fixing</a> and betting racket that is wider than previously suspected have revealed that foreign players in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ipl">Indian Premier League</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl">IPL</a>) had honeytrapped <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/KPL">KPL</a> cricketers in Dubai and Mauritius.</p>
      <p>The list of suspects includes a top pace bowler from a neighbouring country, investigators said.</p>
      <p>Senior police officers said they would soon contact the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and seek its cooperation to question IPL players under the scanner.</p>
      <p>“BCCI has a vigilance team of its own and we want to know whether the team was aware of a few unnatural developments during important matches in the past two KPL seasons,” a senior police officer said.</p>
      <p>“We use the word unnatural because some players suddenly performed way below expectations,” he said. “The players have to provide explanations for their actions. We have arrested players and a team owner for their role in match-fixing and betting.”</p>
      <p>According to highly-placed sources, at the behest of bookies, a few IPL players took some KPL players for “shopping and entertainment” to Dubai and Mauritius, where they had set honeytraps for the cricketers.</p>
      <p>“Among the KPL players who were honeytrapped and blackmailed, some refused to budge to the bookies’ demands,” a source said.</p>
      <p>“I cannot reveal everything at this stage since investigation is in progress,” Bengaluru police commissioner Bhaskar Rao said. “But I can confirm that some KPL players were taken to places like Dubai and Mauritius. They were given expensive gifts. Then they were honeytrapped.</p>
      <p>“If any player who was blackmailed in this manner approaches police, we will keep their names and other details confidential,” Rao said.</p>
      <p>He said a CCB team will study the scorecards of important KPL matches.</p>
      <p>“We will analyse the performance data of each player and compare it with earlier performances by that player,” Rao said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Central-Crime-Branch">Central Crime Branch</a> of Bengaluru police had on Tuesday issued notices to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka">Karnataka</a> State Cricket Association (KSCA) and team managers.</p>
      <p>“Since the roles of a few team owners and coaches have been revealed during the probe, we have issued a notice to the KSCA and KPL team managements. It has 18 points to which they have to reply,” Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (crime), said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Of the CCB’s 18 posers to the KSCA, one is on the Indian Premier League, seeking details of all IPL matches held in Bengaluru in the previous two seasons.</p>
      <p>The CCB has since July arrested eight people in connection with the KPL match-fixing and betting scandal, including Ali Asfak Thara, the owner of Belagavi Panthers, in September.</p>
      <p>Police in October arrested Vinu Prasad, the bowling coach of KPL team Bengaluru Blasters, and M Vishwanathan, wicket-keeper batsman for Hubli Tigers, for betting on matches in the 2018 KPL season. A month later CCB arrested batsman Nishant Singh Shekhawat for fixing matches in the 2018 edition.</p>
