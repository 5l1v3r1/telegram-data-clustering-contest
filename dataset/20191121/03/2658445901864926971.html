      <p>Jose Mourinho was at Tottenham’s training ground yesterday to meet his new squad following his appointment as Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement at the struggling Premier League club.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United manager was announced as the new boss at White Hart Lane hours after the Argentine was sacked.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old, who had been out of work since leaving United last December, signed a contract until the end of the 2022-23 season after the Spurs hierarchy acted to halt their slide down the table.</p>
