        <b>An island group that's part of Papua New Guinea is about to vote on independence. And, if the poll goes as expected, Bougainville could become the world's next country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The islands' history includes colonial exploitation, attempts at independence, a nine-year war and a gradual peace process.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, a new chapter will be written, when 207,000 people begin voting on whether they want greater autonomy or independence.</p>
      <p>Observers expect up to three-quarters to opt for independence - but the poll will just be a first step.</p>
      <h3>Why independence?</h3>
      <p>The islands were named after an 18th Century French explorer and became part of a German colony, German New Guinea, at the end of the 19th Century.</p>
      <p>During World War One, Australia took control and remained in charge until 1975 (with a brief period of Japanese control during World War Two).</p>
      <p>While under colonial control, Bougainville - current population 300,000 - was always an outpost.</p>
      <p>The Germans' first administrative centre was not established until 1905 - 21 years after their rule began.</p>
      <p>And, <a href="http://bougainville-referendum.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the_bougainville_referendum_low_res_1.pdf">according to referendum literature</a>, "some parts of mountainous central and northern Bougainville had little contact with either churches or the colonial regime until after World War Two".</p>

      <p>When Papua New Guinea was granted independence in 1975, Bougainville became a province, even though there was little enthusiasm for it.</p>
      <p>In fact, there was even a declaration of independence shortly before PNG was formed - an attempt to create the "Republic of the North Solomons". However it was ignored by both Australia and PNG.</p>
      <p>The declaration was the manifestation of a Bougainville identity which developed during the 20th Century. Initially a response to plantation colonialism, it developed thanks to perceived racism and economic exploitation.</p>
      <p>The primary marker of that identity was dark skin colour - most Bougainvilleans have darker skin than most, though not all, people from elsewhere in PNG.</p>
      <p>After the failed independence declaration, discontent simmered and in 1988 a nine-year separatist war began.</p>
      <p>Estimates of the number of people killed range from 4,000 to 20,000 - between 3 and 13% of the islands' population at the start of the war.</p>
      <p>The fighting came to an end in 1997 with help from international mediators. The result was the Bougainville Peace Agreement (BPA), the creation in 2005 of the <a href="http://www.abg.gov.pg/">Autonomous Bougainville Government</a>, and the promise of a non-binding referendum on independence.</p>

      <h3>So what options are there?</h3>
      <p>On the ballot, people will have two options: greater autonomy or independence.</p>
      <p>The expectation is that the province will vote in favour of independence - but it's not a given, so there are three possible outcomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People vote for more autonomy, turning down the independence option. In that case, Bougainville would stay part of PNG and details would be worked out</li>
        <li>People vote for independence and PNG accepts the vote. The province would then transition to become a sovereign country</li>
        <li>People vote for independence but PNG does not accept the outcome or tries to delay any further steps. This might lead to a new crisis and fresh conflict</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Voting will be held between 23 November and 7 December and results are expected later in December.</p>
      <p>The Referendum Commission is headed by former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who helped to negotiate 1998 Good Friday Agreement as part of the Northern Ireland peace process.</p>
      <p>"There is a palpable pride that the eyes of the world are watching," <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/nov/21/peace-agreements-normally-fail-within-five-years-bougainville-is-a-lesson-to-us-all">Mr Ahern wrote this week.</a> "I believe the process will be a credible one, free of the fear and intimidation once wrought by weapons of war."</p>

      <h3>What does Papua New Guinea say?</h3>
      <p>The central government has previously withheld funding for the referendum process, and its preference is for the region to remain within the country.</p>
      <p>In October, <a href="https://postcourier.com.pg/marape-congratulates-bvilleans-on-the-eve-of-referendum/">new Prime Minister James Marape reiterated that the vote was non-binding</a>, and that the result would be "deliberated upon" by the governments of PNG and Bougainville.</p>
      <p>So why does PNG want Bougainville to stay?</p>
      <p>For one, Bougainville is rich in natural resources. While the war brought much of the copper and gold mining operations to a halt, the province used to be one of PNG's richest before the war.</p>
      <p>The other worry is that it might set a precedent. If Bougainville gets independence, other PNG provinces (there are more than 20) could also up their demands for greater autonomy - or possibly secession.</p>
      <h3>Is Bougainville ready for independence?</h3>
      <p>The new country - should it happen - would be small, with a land mass of less than 10,000 square kilometres (slightly larger than Cyprus, and slightly smaller than Lebanon).</p>
      <p>Likewise, its population would be one of the world's smallest - slightly smaller than Pacific neighbour Vanuatu, and slightly bigger than Barbados.</p>
      <p>But according to research by Australia's Lowy Institute, Bougainville achieving self-reliance would at best be years away.</p>

      <p>The country is rich in natural resources - especially copper, which has been extracted on a large scale since the 1960s under Australian administration.</p>
      <p>But mining operations have been crippled by the war - and the distribution of revenue was one of the factors behind the conflict.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/bougainville-referendum-and-beyond">One estimate cited by the Lowy Institute</a> says Bougainville would only have 56% of the revenue needed to be self-reliant.</p>
      <h3>What are other countries doing?</h3>
      <p>Australia, the closest wealthy country, is Bougainville's biggest donor and was involved in the mediation that ended the fighting.</p>
      <p>It says it will accept "any settlement negotiated", but most Bougainvilleans believe that Australia opposes independence.</p>
      <p>From further afield, the US and China are also watching the developments closely.</p>
      <p>China is thought to already have sent a delegation to look at investing in Bougainville, including a new port. Beijing has recently increased its efforts to boost ties with island nations in the Pacific, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-49766262">establishing diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands and Kiribati</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the US - <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-papua-bougainville-china/u-s-edges-china-out-of-race-to-fund-bougainville-independence-vote-idUSKBN1WV085">along with Australia, New Zealand, and Japan</a> - have provided funds to help with the referendum.</p>
