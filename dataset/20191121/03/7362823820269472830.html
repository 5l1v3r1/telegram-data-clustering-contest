      <h1>Buttigieg plays up blue-collar cred: 'Literally the least wealthy person on this stage'</h1>

      <p>ATLANTA -- South Bend, Ind., Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> has been working to differentiate himself from the other top-tier <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats">Democratic</a> candidates in terms of policy differences, but during Wednesday night's debate, he pointed to a personal distinction -- namely, his relatively modest means.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg referred to a Forbes Magazine article that listed all of the presidential candidates according to their net worth.</p>
      <p>"I'm literally the least wealthy person on this stage," Buttigieg said.</p>

          <b>SANDERS WARNS 'WE WILL LOSE THIS ELECTION' IF DEMS FOCUS SOLELY ON TRUMP</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Buttigieg likely was referring to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2019/08/14/heres-the-net-worth-of-every-2020-presidential-candidate/#223d737a37c5">Forbes</a> piece published in August 2019. According to that article, the Democrat at the top of the list was Tom Steyer with a net worth of $1.6 billion. The reported median: $2 million. Buttigieg trailed all of them with an estimated net worth of $100,000.</p>
      <p>President Trump, meanwhile, was listed as nearly twice as wealthy as Steyer with an estimated $3.1 billion. Buttigieg pointed out the sharp contrast between the two.</p>
      <p>While Trump has been known for spending time at golf courses bearing his name, Buttigieg stated, "I don't even golf."</p>

      <p>Of the candidates still in the race, Buttigieg was one of just three on the list with a net worth of less than $1 million. The article listed former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro at $700,000 and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, at $500,000.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg's fellow front-runners, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., were listed at $9 million, $12 million and $2.5 million, respectively.</p>
