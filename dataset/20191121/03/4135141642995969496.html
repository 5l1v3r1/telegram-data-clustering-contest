      <h1>Cleveland Cavaliers losing streak extends to five to surging Miami HEAT, 124-100</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:23:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:23</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p><b>MIAMI (AP) —</b> Duncan Robinson set Miami records for 3-pointers in a quarter and a half on his way to 29 points, and the Heat remained unbeaten at home this season with a 124-100 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Playing in front of his college coach — the Cavs’ John Beilein, who had Robinson at Michigan — the second-year guard was 9 for 15 from the field, with all those shots coming from behind the arc. Robinson set team marks with seven 3-pointers in the second quarter and eight in the first half.</p>
      <p>His flurry helped Miami tie a franchise mark with 75 first-half points. The lead was 27 at the break and the Heat stayed in control the rest of the way. Kevin Love’s jumper with 9:07 left got Cleveland to 102-86 and capped a 13-3 run, but the Cavs didn’t get any closer.</p>
      <p>Tyler Herro scored 22 points for Miami, which had no problem on a night when Jimmy Butler missed 12 of his first 13 shots and finished with 21 points.</p>
      <p>Love scored 25 and grabbed 13 rebounds for Cleveland. Collin Sexton added 19 points.</p>
      <p>The Heat record for 3-pointers in a game is 10, a mark held by Mario Chalmers and Brian Shaw. Robinson had three shots in the final moments to get his 10th — missing them all. He connected on one with about 15 seconds left, but it was waved off by a shot clock violation.</p>
      <p>It was Cleveland’s 17th consecutive loss in Miami, a stretch that started during the 2010-11 season — LeBron James’ first with the Heat after leaving the Cavaliers for the first time.</p>
      <p>The Heat record for 3-pointers in a half had been six, held by many and done most recently by Wayne Ellington in the second half against Toronto on April 11, 2018. The record for 3s in a quarter also was six — Ellington did that twice (the Toronto game in 2018, and against Atlanta in 2017), and Shaw did it first against Milwaukee in 1993.</p>
      <p>Those marks belong to Robinson now.</p>
      <p>He had 24 points by halftime, all on 3-pointers. That was better than his full-game career best of 23, set at home earlier this season against Houston.</p>
      <p>Robinson’s high in three seasons under Beilein at Michigan was 21. His only 30-point effort in college came in 2014 — for Williams against Amherst in the 2014 NCAA Division III semifinals. His G League high last season was 36 for Sioux Falls.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <p>Cavaliers: Cleveland’s 17-game losing streak at Miami has included 74 players and six coaches. The Cavs’ last win in Miami was Jan. 25, 2010. … Cleveland starters Cedi Osman, Darius Garland and Sexton were a combined 2 for 17 for seven points in 43 first-half minutes. They didn’t start the second half.</p>
      <p>Heat: Miami improved to 10-3, tying the best 13-game start in team history. The 1995-96, 1999-2000, 2012-13 and 2013-14 Heat also were 10-3. … Adebayo was 4 for 4 in the opening three minutes, and finished 5 for 5. … Erik Spoelstra improved to 533-366 in 899 games as Heat coach. His milestone 900th is Friday in Chicago.</p>
      <p>HEAT AT HOME</p>
      <p>The Heat are 6-0 at home, the first time that’s happened since 2012-13. The biggest deficit they’ve faced at home this season is eight points — every other team in the league has trailed by more at home at least once.</p>
      <p>THOMPSON RESTS</p>
      <p>The Cavaliers gave Tristan Thompson the night off to rest, mindful that they have a back-to-back later this week. It was the first game Thompson has missed this season — but the third straight Cavaliers at Heat game in which he hasn’t played.</p>
