      <h1>6.1 quake near Thai-Laos border shakes the kingdom</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:08:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Hanging lights could be seen swinging back and forth without anyone touching them on the 10th floor of a Bangkok office building this morning. Paranormal activity? No, in an uncommon occurrence, it was actually a moderately strong earthquake. </p>
      <p>This morning <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%9C%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A7&amp;src=trend_click&amp;pt=1197338550456307712%2C1197337249819443200">#Earthquake</a> became a top trending hashtag in Thailand after a shallow magnitude-6.1 quake hit northwestern Laos near the Thai border early Thursday, sending tremors across the region.</p>
      <p>“The shaking … was the main shock from a quake in Laos at 6:50 am and was felt in northern and northeastern Thailand and Bangkok and suburbs,” said Sophon Chaila, an official at the Thai Meteorological Department.</p>
      <p>Shaking could be felt more than 700 kilometres away in the Thai capital Bangkok, where Pope Francis is currently on a <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/pope-francis-lands-in-bangkok-for-4-day-visit-photos/">four-day visit</a>. </p>

      </p>
      <p>There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries after the quake struck.</p>
      <p>Many on social media flocked to share videos of the quake that seemed felt the most by those in high-rise buildings. Suspended lights and chandeliers could be seen swinging back and forth from the motion. </p>

      <p>Residents in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi also felt buildings sway.</p>
      <p>“The ceiling lights were shaking quite strongly. I felt dizzy and scared,” said Hanoi resident Tran Hoa Phuong, who felt the earthquake in her 27-storey apartment building.</p>
      <p>The temblor hit about three hours after a 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck the same region of Laos, near the site of the large Xayaburi dam project.</p>
      <p>Information is slow to trickle out of the closed communist state, and there were no reports of damage or injuries after the twin quakes early Thursday.</p>
      <p>Pope Francis arrived in Bangkok on Wednesday and has a busy agenda Thursday meeting officials and His Majesty the King before he leads a mass in the evening.</p>
      <p>There was no word from his team on whether he felt the quake.</p>
