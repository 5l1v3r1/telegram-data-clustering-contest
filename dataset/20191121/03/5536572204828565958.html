      <h1>Joe Thomas Calls Out Steelers QB Mason Rudolph For His Rehearsed Statement Addressing Fight (TWEET)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:37:40+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:37</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>After six days, Mason Rudolph finally spoke with the media for the first time since his altercation with Myles Garrett that is mostly remembered for his helmet being snatched off his head and him being hit with it.</p>
      <p>Rudolph began his presser by reading a prepared statement, in which he apologized for his role in the fight and stated he should’ve done a better job keeping his cool. The Steelers QB stated he became angry with what he felt like was a late hit by Garret.</p>
      <p>Rudolph said the Steelers had “already lost two of our players to targeting penalties.” Former Browns Pro Bowl offensive lineman Joe Thomas criticized Rudolph and the Steelers for taking way too long to release a statement that was inaccurate.</p>

      <p>Even if you feel Rudolph caused the entire altercation by attempting to remove Garrett’s helmet, it was Garrett who ultimately took it to the next level by swinging that helmet and getting himself suspended for the rest of the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>It was a terrible moment I’m sure both parties would like to move on from.</p>
