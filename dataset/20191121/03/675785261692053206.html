      <p>A woman is bidding to visit every Morrisons store in honour of her late grandparents.</p>
      <p>Janine Schofield, 27, has been to 148 of the 493 branches.</p>
      <p>Her gran and grandad, Pam and Ken, used to treat her at Morrisons cafes.</p>
      <p>Janine’s bizarre quest is made even more difficult because she lives on Guernsey - which is technically not in the UK.</p>
      <p>The accountant uses trips to the mainland to cram in as many supermarkets as she can.</p>
      <p>She said: “Friends think I’m mad but are also very supportive.</p>

      <p>“For example if I visit them and there is a store near where they live that I haven’t visited they’re happy to take me.”</p>
      <p>Whenever she visits one she takes a photo in the store and buys something so she can keep the receipt as proof.</p>
      <p>Her hobby began in 2007 when she was 14 and taken to the cafe of Morrisons in Cleveleys, near Blackpool, by her grandparents, Pam and Ken.</p>
      <p>all in Britain, bar one</p>
      <p>Pam, who suffered from Alzheimer’s. died away in 2010 and grandfather in 2014</p>
      <p>Janine and her younger sister Elise often accompanied the elderly couple.</p>

      <p>The furthest north her hobby has taken her is Glasgow while the furthest south on the mainland is Penzance.</p>
      <p>The most she has visited in a single day is seven, which she achieved in the Midlands.</p>
      <p>She said her dream would be to take a year off work and spend 12 months travelling the country to visit the rest.</p>
      <p>Such is the extent of Janine’s strange hobby, in 2014 she was given a behind-the-scenes tour of the company’s headquarters in Bradford.</p>

      <p>In 2014 Janine had the opportunity to visit the headquarters in Bradford and got a behind-the-scenes tour where she met the CEO at the time, Dalton Phillips.</p>
      <p>She also uses a large Morrisons flag as a blanket and has her own name badge and fleece.</p>
      <p>She also has an extensive collection of memorabilia her home has Morrisons carrier bags on some of the walls.</p>
