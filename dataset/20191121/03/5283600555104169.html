      <p>Electricity generation, as well as trading of power in the exchanges, have dipped in October, reflecting weakness in the Indian economy.</p>

      <h4>Broker's call: <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/stocks/bandhan-bank-ltd/overview/">Bandhan Bank</a> (Buy)</h4>
      <p>JMFL</p>
      <p>CMP:₹525.35</p>
      <p>Target:₹710</p>
      <p>With respect to complying with RBI guidelines on promoter stake reduction, the bank continues to engage with the regulator having swiftly reduced promoters’ stake to 60.96 per cent (as of October 21, 2019), though still away from what is required. The management mentioned that in the absence of regulatory a go-ahead for collapsing the three-tier structure, the option to reduce stake through inorganic means is not on the table (given that the Gruh-merger gives them the desired diversification) and the bank does not need primary capital (CET1 at 28.45 per cent including 1HFY20 profits).</p>
      <p>With regards to a secondary stake sale, nothing is currently being considered given that it continues to engage with the regulator. In our view, it is pertinent to note that Bandhan Bank has a history of having long-term shareholders with a focus to satisfy developmental needs in emerging economies and management still seems inclined towards such partners in the business. We continue to like Bandhan for strong track record on profitability, asset quality and efficiency.</p>
      <p>In our view, Bandhan Bank has a strong growth runway and the Gruh merger gives it a much-need diversification while ensuring stability and compliments the business model.</p>

      <h4>Broker's call -<a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/stocks/itd-cementation-india-ltd/overview/"> ITD Cementation</a> (Buy)</h4>
      <p>ANANDRATHI</p>
      <p>CMP: ₹58.65</p>
      <p>Target: ₹74</p>
      <p>Key takeaways: a) The about ₹1,000 crore Q1 additions were followed by about ₹1,900 crore in Q2, with L1 for about ₹2,000 crore  already in Q3. With this, ITD is in touching distance of its 15-month FY19 addition of about ₹5,100 crore. The about ₹13,000 crore healthy prospects suggest more is likely in the rest of the year. Year-to-date additions, though diversified, seem to be lacking marine; consequently, marine’s share in the OB is now below 30 per cent.</p>
      <p>b) The about ₹16,100 crore lower q-o-q consolidated net debt (at about ₹460 crore), despite sequentially flat standalone net debt implies the Bengaluru metro-rail SPV generated positive cash-flows to effect the lower debt. This augurs well as there were concerns about this zero-margin project (post lowered scope) generating cash flows to meet obligations.</p>
      <p>c) Without quantifying, management reiterated that contingency reserves and the various insurances availed of would cover any additional costs it mayface because of the issue at hand. With regard to time over-run (and, consequently, higher costs), it hopes to be reimbursed by the client.</p>
      <p>Valuations: FY20e earnings have been reduced around 17 per cent (around 7 per cent for FY21) as we lower our margin expectation.</p>
      <p>Risk: Slower-than-expected execution.</p>

      <h4>Why the BPCL share price is falling after divestment announcement</h4>
      <p>The share price of <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/stocks/bharat-petroleum-corporation-ltd/overview/">BPCL</a>, one of India’s largest public sector oil refineries, has shown a muted response to an announcement by the government to divest its entire stake in the company. BPCL’s share price declined by 2.74 per cent to Rs 529 after the market opened on Thursday. The key reason is the anticipation of a lower valuation for BPCL's Numaligarh Refinery.</p>
      <p>Analysts told <i>BusinessLine </i>that BPCL’s overall valuation could be impacted as the company’s Numaligarh Refinery (NRL) would be carved out, to be taken over by another PSU.</p>
