      <p>At the inaugural ceremony of IFFI 2019, Javadekar described cinema as India’s “soft power” while announcing the setting up of a single-window clearance system for processing of permissions for film shoots.</p>
      <p>“India has such scenic locations, sites, but for shoots, one has to take 15-20 permissions. We are starting a single window system for (permission) for shootings. Goa, Leh-Ladakh and Andaman and Nicobar will also benefit,” Javadekar said during the inaugural session.</p>
      <p>The inaugural session, compèred by well known director Karan Johar, began with a tribute to Goa’s stalwart politician the late Manohar Parrikar who hosted the first IFFI in Goa.</p>

      <p>“I am extremely happy to receive the Icon of the Golden Jubilee. I dedicate this to all my directors, producers and technicians who have been with me and above all my fans,” Rajinikanth said on receiving the award.</p>
      <p>Maria Lemesheva, head of the delegation from Russia, which is the country under focus in this edition of the festival, invited Indian film makers to shoot in Russia and work on co-productions, saying the Russian government had recently announced a 40 per cent rebate on foreign films shot there.</p>

      <p>Amitabh Bachchan who was specially felicitated on the occasion said that he owes his success to his fans. “This is a debt on my head of your love and affection. I would not be able to repay the debt and I would not want to, because I would like to keep it forever,” he said.</p>
