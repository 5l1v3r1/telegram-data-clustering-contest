      <p>ATLANTA -- Former Vice President Joe Biden is continuing to push for modifications to Obama-era health care reforms over the holistic "Medicare for all" proposals from two of his Democratic presidential rivals.</p>
      <p>In Wednesday night's Democratic debate, Biden argued that voters are hesitant to make the transformative, government-backed changes pushed by candidates including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.</p>
      <p>Biden says he doesn't want to force anyone to give up private health insurance.</p>
      <p>Warren says that she wants to "bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as fast as we can."</p>
      <p>When questioning came to Sanders, he responded: "Thank you, I wrote the damn bill."</p>
