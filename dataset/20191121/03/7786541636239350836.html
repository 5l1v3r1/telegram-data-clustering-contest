      <p><b>MADRIDÂ (AP)</b> - Not even some late heroics - some very, very late ones - were enough to keep the United States from being eliminated from the Davis Cup Finals on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The U.S. failed to advance despite beating Italy 2-1 after a doubles match that ended past 4 a.m. local time in Madrid, the second latest finish in tennis history.</p>
      <p>Sam Querrey and Jack Sock won the decisive doubles match 7-6 (4), 6-7 (2), 6-4 against Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini, but it wasn't enough to secure the Americans in the quarterfinals as one of the two-best second-place finishers from the six groups.</p>
      <p>Only a big win against Italy, without losing many sets or games, would have been enough to send the U.S. to the knockout stage of the revamped team competition.</p>
      <p>With the elimination, the U.S. will equal its longest gap between Davis Cup titles, with its last one coming in 2007.</p>
      <p>The doubles match ended 4:04 a.m. in the Spanish capital (10:04 p.m. ET, 0304 GMT), the latest finish in U.S. Davis Cup history and second in tennis history behind Lleyton Hewitt's victory over Marcos Baghdatis at the 2008 Australian Open, which ended past 4:30 a.m. local time.</p>
      <p>"I don't even know where we are, what time it is, what day it is," U.S. team captain Mardy Fish said. "That was pretty special from these guys, for sure."</p>
      <p>Taylor Fritz had kept the U.S. hopes alive by defeating Matteo Berrettini 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-2 to level the series at 1-1 after Fognini had beaten Reilly Opelka 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-3 to put Italy ahead.</p>
      <p>"I'm excited for Taylor," Fish said. "That's one of the biggest wins of his life. I'm just happy to be part of it."</p>
      <p>The American team lost to Canada in its opening series on Tuesday - its first Davis Cup defeat against the North American neighbors. Italy also lost to the Canadians, who won the group and will face Australia in Thursday's quarterfinal.</p>
      <p>The U.S. sent to Madrid its youngest Davis Cup team in a decade, with 22-year-olds Fritz and Opelka making their tournament debuts. Fritz was the team's highest-ranked player at No. 32.</p>
      <p>The new Davis Cup is being played in a World Cup-style format with all 18 teams playing in a single venue in the same week, instead of the head-to-head confrontations that used to take place at varied sites over four weekends throughout the year.</p>
