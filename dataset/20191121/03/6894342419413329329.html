      <h1>The So-Called Flying Car Does Not Have Clearance To Go Up In The Air Today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:31:55+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/chapree/" target="_blank">Chief Chapree</a></address>
      <p>Among the main topic that made it into the headlines for past few days is the subject of <i>“flying car”, </i>mainly thanks to the revelation by the Minister of Entrepreneur Development, Mohd Redzuan Md Yusof that <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199687/malaysia-flying-car-test-flight-21-nov/">a test flight will take place later today</a>. As it turns out, that is not going to happen.</p>
      <p>While the minister refused to disclose the test location of the so-called flying car, the <b>Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia</b> (CAAM) has released a statement yesterday that the test flight didn’t receive any authorization from the regulatory body. Not only that, the statement also revealed the location of test flight which apparently located at the hanger of <a href="https://miat.unikl.edu.my/">UniKL’s Malaysian Institute of Aviation Technology</a> in Subang Airport.</p>

      <p>As shown in the statement above, the location of the test flight is within a busy and highly regulated airspace. Furthermore, the flying car which is actually an EHang 216 passenger drone itself was not given permission by the Chinese authority to fly outside of EHang’s R&amp;D area in Guangzhou, China.</p>
      <p>CAAM spilt the tea even further by stating that an unauthorized test flight has taken place at the Subang Airport area last month which is now being investigated by the regulator.</p>

      <p>In the end, it seems possible that the unauthorized test flight could be the actual factor that jeopardizing the EastCap’s intention to roll out EHang 216 in our market, rather than a public test flight as per the minister’s earlier remark.</p>
