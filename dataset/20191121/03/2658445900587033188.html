      <p>The Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) and the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) have pledged to work together to enhance supply and usage of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>They made the commitment when NALPGAM president Nosa Ogieva-Okunbor and his executive members visited the NUPENG Secretariat in Lagos.</p>
      <p>Ogieva-Okunbor said NALPGAM’s goal was to ensure the usage of LPG, commonly referred to as cooking gas, across the country.</p>
      <p>He said: “We want gas supply to be improved so that ordinary Nigerians can buy it at an affordable cost.</p>
      <p>“The current hike in the price gas is not good because some persons who have hitherto abandoned the usage of kerosene and firewood are going back because they cannot afford gas.</p>

      <p>“We know this harms the health of our women and the climate as well as the Federal Government’s plan to increase gas usage in Nigerian homes.”</p>
      <p>He said the visit was to strengthen the associations’ relationship towards making the supply and distribution of LPG safer.</p>
      <p>To this end, he said the group would partner with NUPENG on training and retraining of tanker drivers to reduce the frequency of accidents on the highways.</p>
      <p>NUPENG National President Mr Williams Akporeha said gas was a product of the future.</p>
      <p>He urged stakeholders in the sector to brace up for the challenges to come to deepen its usage.</p>
      <p>The NUPENG boss noted that collaboration by stakeholders was key to achieving their purposes as businesses and associations.</p>
