      <h1>Sadio Mane outlines why Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is 'the best in the world'</h1>
      <h2>Klopp has helped Mane develop into a Ballon D'Or contender - and Senegal forward has highlighted his manager's qualities</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:57:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:57</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Sadio Mane has hailed Jurgen Klopp as 'the best in the world' as he praised the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> manager's man-management, motivational skills and tactical prowess.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/sadio-mane">Mane</a> was one of Klopp's first signings as Liverpool boss, arriving at Anfield from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> for £34million in the summer of 2016.</p>
      <p>And club, manager and player have all gone from strength to strength since then.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Klopp</a> led Liverpool to last season's Champions League triumph and the Reds are currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Mane has been a huge part of that success, and is now regarded as one of the world's best players having been shortlisted for this year's Ballon D'Or.</p>

      <p>And the Senegal international has outlined just why he believes Klopp is the best on the planet.</p>
      <p>“I would struggle to describe just how successful he has been for Liverpool," Mane told the Official Liverpool FC Monthly Magazine.</p>
      <p>“Everybody can see what he has done for this club, for this city and the quality he has as a manager.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of good managers in Europe but what I can say is that our manager always has the right words and the right things to manage his team, especially knowing how to deal with his team.</p>

      <p>“I would always trust his influence on the team. He is a winner and I would say he is the best in the world.”</p>
      <p>Mane, who shared the Premier League Golden Boot with team-mate Mohamed Salah and Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang last season, is the Reds leading scorer so far this term with 11 goals to date.</p>
      <p>Between them, Mane, Salah and Roberto Firmino have plundered 182 goals for the club since the start of the 2017/18 season.</p>
      <p>And Mane said: “We are all from different countries and speak different first languages but I think football is one language and it is universal so everybody can speak it.</p>
      <p>“It is the same with Mo, Bobby and myself.”</p>
