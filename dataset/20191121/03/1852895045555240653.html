      <h1>Amy Klobuchar Insists A Woman Could Beat Donald Trump — ‘Nancy Pelosi Does It Every Day’</h1>

      <h4>Amy Klobuchar had a message to voters at the November 20 Democratic debate: if you think President Trump can’t be taken down by a woman in 2020, just look at how Nancy Pelosi’s ‘beating him’ on the daily.</h4>
      <p>It’s a line that <b>Amy Klobuchar</b> delivers often, but tonight it carried different weight. The Minnesota senator largely focused her remarks during the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/20/how-to-watch-november-democratic-debate-time-date/">fifth Democratic debate</a> on the deep gender parity in politics, especially the need, of course, to see a woman in the country’s highest office. We shouldn’t underestimate any of the four female presidential candidates onstage during the November 19 primary debate, Klobuchar said, because, “If you think a woman can’t beat<b> Donald Trump</b>; <b>Nancy Pelosi</b> does it every day.” Boom! Her one-liner resonated with viewers of all genders, who praised the senator — who doesn’t get much air time — for her quick wit. She makes a good point.</p>
      <p>The Democratic debate, this month held in Atlanta, comes in the midst of the days-long <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/what-is-impeachment-how-does-it-work-3800183/">impeachment hearings</a>, as the House Intelligence Committee interviews witnesses and hears testimony about President Trump’s controversial phone call with the president of Ukraine. After today, November 20’s damning testimony by EU ambassador <b>Gordon Sondland</b>, who implicated both Trump and Vice President, #PresidentPelosi started trending on Twitter. Per the United States Constitution, should the president and vice president both be removed from office, the Speaker of the House (currently Pelosi) becomes president.</p>
      <p>Klobuchar’s remarks about the need for a female president didn’t stop with her Pelosi quip. “Women are held to a higher standard [than men],” the senator said. “Otherwise, we could play a game called, ‘Name Your Favorite Woman President,’ which we can’t do because it has all been men.” Watch her deliver those remarks, and her colleagues reactions, below:</p>

      <p>Tonight also marks the third time in US history that all of the debate moderators are female. You read that correctly. The debate, co-hosted by MSNBC and <i>The Washington Post</i>, was moderated by MSNBC’s <b>Rachel Maddow</b> and <b>Andrea Mitchell</b>, NBC News correspondent <b>Kristen Welker</b>, and <i>Washington Post</i> reporter <b>Ashley Parker</b>. With four female candidates onstage, it was an historic night.</p>
