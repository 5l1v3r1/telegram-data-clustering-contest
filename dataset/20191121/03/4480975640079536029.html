      <h1>USD/JPY bounces from 200-day MA after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He's remark on trade</h1>

          <b>USD/JPY has bounced up from the 200-day MA support of 108.96. </b>
        </li>

          <b>China's Vice Premier Liu He is cautiously optimistic about the prospects of the US-China trade deal. </b>
        </li>

          <b>Related markets, however, are not buying Liu He's optimism. </b>

      <p>USD/JPY eked out moderate recovery from the 200-day moving average support after China's Vice Premier and trade negotiator Liu He noted that he is "cautiously optimistic" about reaching a phase one trade deal.</p>
      <p>The currency pair is currently trading at 108.49, representing a 0.13% drop on the day, having bounced from the 200-day moving average support of 108.96 in the last one hour.</p>
      <p>With Liu He expressing cautious optimism on trade, some traders likely squared off long JPY trades, helping the pair <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> a minor recovery. The futures on the S&amp;P 500, however, are still reporting a 0.22% drop. Further, the Asian equities are down with Japan's Nikkei reporting a 1% drop.</p>
      <p>Further, the US 10-year treasury yield is showing no sign of life. The yield is currently trading at two-week lows near 1.73%.</p>
      <p>Put simply, the equity and bond markets are not impressed by Vice Premier Liu He's comments and continue to worry about the waning trade optimism amid escalating political tensions.</p>
      <p>The USD/JPY pair, therefore, may fall back to the 200-day average at 108.96. However, if the equities recover, the pair will likely move into the positive territory above 108.60.</p>
