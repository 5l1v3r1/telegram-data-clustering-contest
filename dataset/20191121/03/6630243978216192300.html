        <b>Ugandans have expressed sexual reproductive health concerns following Wednesday’s confirmation by global health charity Marie Stopes that it had recalled hundreds of thousands of faulty condoms on sale in Uganda.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The recall followed a warning from Uganda’s National Drug Authority (NDA) that the Life Guard brand condoms had failed manufacturing “quality tests” because they contained holes and may burst.</p>
      <p>The affected condoms were manufactured by India-based MHL Healthcare in April 2019 and have an expiry date of April 2024, the government regulator said.</p>
      <p>Marie Stopes Uganda spokesman David Kamu told AFP on Wednesday that the two affected batches each contained “around 400,000” condoms.</p>
      <p>Earlier reports had suggested millions of condoms could have been involved but NDA spokesman Fred Ssekyana told AFP the figure was below one million.</p>
      <p>Marie Stopes Uganda said more than half of the condoms of concern had been recalled.</p>
      <p>“While the LifeGuard brand follows strict quality controls, unfortunately two recent batches have fallen short of the quality we demand,” the charity’s country director, Carole Sekimpi, said in a statement Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Marie Stopes is the largest and most specialised sexual reproductive health organisation in Uganda, the charity says on its website.</p>
      <p>According to UNAIDS, 1.4 million Ugandans are living with HIV.</p>
      <p>Last year 53,000 people were newly infected with the disease in the East African country, the UN agency said.</p>
