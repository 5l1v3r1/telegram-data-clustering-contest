      <p>ACTING Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr Ibrahim Magu has reiterated the agency’s commitment to respect for human rights.</p>
      <p>He said in the agency’s constitutional mandate of waging war against corruption, it does not target any particular individual or group of people.</p>
      <p>Magu spoke yesterday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, while featuring as a discussant at the state chapter of Human Rights Stakeholders’ Summit of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).</p>
      <p>The anti-graft chief was represented by the Head of EFCC’s Ibadan zonal office, Friday Ebelo.</p>
      <p>According to him, the anti-graft agency always does its best in handling its suspects with dignity and respect to avoid infringing on their rights.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing like ‘We Against Them’ in our effort to rid our nation of economic and financial crimes. We take issues of human rights seriously and we always do our best to respect the legitimate rights of our suspects,” he said.</p>
