      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> The ministry of external affairs received over 6,000 complaints of women deserted by their NRI spouses between January 2015 and October this year, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said in response to a query in the Lok Sabha.</p>
      <p>About 1,498 complaints were received in 2017, 1510 in 2016 and 796 in 2015.</p>
      <p>This is not a new situation in India. In fact, a sudden spurt in cases of NRI marriage frauds pushed the government to bring the Registration of Marriage or Non-Resident Indian Bill, 2019. It was introduced in the Rajya Sabha by former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj early this year.</p>
      <p>The ‘Registration of Marriage of Non-Resident Indian Bill, 2019’ empowers passport authorities to impound or revoke passport or travel documents of NRIs who fail to register their marriage within 30 days after getting married.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Bill has been referred to Parliament’s standing committee on external affairs.<br/>If an NRI man fails to register his marriage within the stipulated time, his passport can be impounded or revoked.</p>
      <p>Also, it allows courts to attach properties, movable and immovable, of “proclaimed offenders” or people who fail to appear before courts despite warrants being issued against them.</p>
      <p>The proposed law will be applicable to NRIs marrying Indian women within or even outside India, according to the bill.</p>
