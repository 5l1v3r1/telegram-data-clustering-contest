      <p><b>HARRISBURG, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - The Pennsylvania state Senate on Wednesday passed a package of legislation inspired by Roman Catholic Church scandals to relax criminal and civil statutes of limitations on sexual abuse crimes. Here is a look at the bills:</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>CRIMINAL PROSECUTION</p>
      <p>There would be no statute of limitation on the criminal prosecution of major child sexual abuse crimes. Under current law, criminal prosecution is limited to a victim's 50th birthday.</p>
      <p>Authorities would have up to 20 years to file charges in sexual abuse cases where young adults 18-23 years old are the victim. Current law gives authorities up to 12 years to file charges in sexual abuse cases where the victim is over 17 years old.</p>
      <p>CIVIL LAWSUITS</p>
      <p>Victims of child sexual abuse would have more time to file civil lawsuits against their abuser or an institution that may have covered it up. Under current law, a victim of child sexual abuse has until their 30th birthday to sue. The bill raises that to their 55th birthday, although that provision applies to future incidents of abuse.</p>
      <p>Young adults 18-23 years old would have until they turn 30 to sue. Current law gives them two years to sue.</p>
      <p>State laws aside, the Senate also began the multi-year process of seeking to amend the Pennsylvania Constitution to allow a two-year window for lawsuits to be filed by now-adult victims of child sexual abuse who are barred from suing by existing or previous statutes of limitation.</p>
      <p>SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY</p>
      <p>Governmental institutions, such as public schools, would lose immunity from civil lawsuits for child sexual abuse if the person suing was harmed by the negligence of the institution.</p>
      <p>NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS</p>
      <p>Nondisclosure contracts or agreements would be unenforceable if they attempt to impair, prohibit or suppress the disclosure of information about a claim of childhood sexual abuse to law enforcement.</p>
