      <h1>What Clockenflap? A guide to Hong Kong’s live music venues to fill the fest-shaped hole in your heart</h1>

      <p>Despairing over the cancellation of this year’s Clockenflap?</p>
      <p>Well, dry your tears. Even without the city’s preeminent live music event, there are still plenty of places to get your live music fix.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s music scene sometimes gets a bad rap, with people often lambasting the SAR for being nothing more than a soulless financial hub with no kind of music scene to speak of.</p>
      <p>It’s true that high rents and stringent regulations for live music venues have made it difficult for the local indie circuit to be as big as other cities’, and <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/hong-kongs-hidden-agenda-close-end-october/">the closing of famous underground music venue Hidden Agenda</a> certainly left a lot of people under the impression that the SAR truly is a cultural desert. That said, though, it is still possible to find good live music in the city. Whether you’re into ear-splitting punk or smooth jazz, here’s a round up of some of the best music venues in town.</p>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Thistownneeds/">This Town Needs</a>
      </h3>

      <p>This Town Needs, or TTN, is probably the most well-known and venerable indie music venue in Hong Kong. After Hidden Agenda announced that it would close its doors for good at the end of October 2017, it wasn’t long before the founders announced in January 2018 that they <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/this-town-needs-hidden-agenda-underground-music-venue-to-return/">would open reopen and rebrand</a> at a new location in Yau Tong. While the venue is best known for hosting indie rock and punk bands from Hong Kong and abroad, it also does host some very good hip-hop nights.</p>

      <p>With its focus on social change and activism, Eaton HK, which opened in early 2019, is unlike any hotel in Hong Kong, and its bar and live music venue Terrible Baby is quickly becoming one of the best places for live indie music on the Kowloon side. Terrible Baby — named after Jean Cocteau’s novel <i>Les Enfants Terribles</i> — has more of a music lounge vibe, with its carpeted floor, low ceiling, comfy leather sofas, and plasma globe lights, but it hosts a number of live music performances from acoustic pop artists like Julie Byrne, to loud and angry post-punk music by David Boring.</p>

      <p>This Tsim Sha Tsui pub and bar is known not just for being dedicated to the famous Australian bush-ranger and outlaw, but also for being home to one of the liveliest jazz nights in the SAR. The bar’s house band — the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRe9O5TSLl8DqnGTSsCwZ3g">Chinacoast Jazzmen</a> led by Colin Aitchison — plays dixie, swing, ragtime and jazz. Performances are free (and loud), and guests can grab a beer while listening to the band play some Cole Porter or Benny Goodman.</p>

      <p>Since it first opened in 1987, this Wan Chai live house has made a name for itself as being <i>the</i> place to go if you want to pound some beers while dancing to loud rock music. It’s a tiny bar, with some old Hong Kong tram-style seating to one side, and no stage, which puts the performers right in your face. While The Wanch does host acoustic nights, it’s better known for its regular roster of live rock bands performing original material, cover, and tribute acts.</p>

      <p>A friendly place that’s more about the jazz than the scene, Peel Fresco has a real New York vibe, regulars say, and most recommend the Tuesday night open mic jam, where you can watch — or play — many different styles of jazz. Fans of the place rave about the good drinks and helpful staff, and say that it’s one of the rare places in the Kong where you won’t be considered a freak if you make small talk with a stranger. We love that.</p>

      <p>This speakeasy has style to spare, so if you’ve got a waistcoat and bowtie at home, then this might be one of the few places you can rock them. With upscale cocktails and a classy crowd, Foxglove focuses on the details — from the jazz (with a focus on modern and free-form), to the style, to the sips. They also have a full menu and quieter tables available if you want something more intimate than the front row. Remember to dress smart.</p>

      <p>An arts center with regular big band jazz nights, this spot is all about the full band and dancing, so wear your most comfortable shoes. The style is Gatsby-esque and the crowd gets as big as the sounds. This is the spot for a crazy night out, when you want to burn some energy on the dance floor but repetitive dance beats ain’t gonna cut it. The dance nights here have been going since the 1980s and are supposedly just as cool now as they were back then. Don’t know the moves? A friendly regular is bound to take you under his or her wing.</p>

      <p>Live music venues that serve food and drink are a very tricky thing. Sometimes the diners jabbering around you makes it difficult to enjoy the music, while the music can make it difficult to enjoy your food (which often tastes like an afterthought anyway). But this Tai Kok Tsui live house has threaded the needle, serving great Western food and hosting a roster of great local artists performing a mixture of music that includes pop, rock, and jazz. As a music venue that serves food, there are some house rules: the shows are divided into three sections, orders will only be taken during the 20 minute breaks in between these sessions, guests are also advised to stay seated, and should refrain from talking or lower their voices during performances. Fair enough.</p>

      <p>Those who have lived in Hong Kong for a while may recognize the BB Jazz Lounge as the former home of the Orange Peel club. After a rebrand, they are still home to high-quality blues and jazz acts, but now they market themselves as being upscale and indulgent, so expect a place that’s as much about the appearance as the music. The food and drinks tend towards wagyu and champagne, and fans call out the place for its “beautiful people” and “classic jazz lounge” vibe.</p>
