      <h1>Google Will Pay Bug Hunters Up To $1.5M if They Can Hack Its Titan M Chip</h1>

      <p>Google announced today that it is willing to dish out bug bounty cash rewards of up to $1.5 million if security researchers find and report bugs in the Android operating system that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-will-pay-bug-hunters-up-to-1-5m-if-they-can-hack-its-titan-m-chip/">can also compromise its new Titan M security chip</a>. From a report:<i> Launched last year, the <a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/18/08/30/1445257/googles-50-titan-security-keys-are-now-available-in-the-us">Titan M chip is currently part of Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 4 devices</a>. It's a separate chip that's included in both phones and is dedicated solely to processing sensitive data and processes, like Verified Boot, on-device disk encryption, lock screen protections, secure transactions, and more. Google says that if researchers manage to find "a full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence" that also compromises data protected by Titan M, they are willing to pay up to $1 million to the bug hunter who finds it. If the exploit chain works against a preview version of the Android OS, the reward can go up to $1.5 million.</i></p>
