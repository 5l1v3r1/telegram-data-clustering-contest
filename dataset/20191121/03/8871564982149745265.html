      <h1>British model arrested in Bali to be extradited to his home country: official</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:30:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>British model Terrence Murrell, who was arrested in Bali a few months ago for alleged drug use and overstaying his visa, will soon be extradited to the United Kingdom, the immigration office said yesterday, as the Indonesian government has received an Interpol Red Notice for the British fugitive.</p>
      <p>“[We] have received an [Interpol] red notice from the British government for a British citizen named Terrence David Mueller,” Amran Aris, who heads the Class 1 Immigration Office at Ngurah Rai International Airport, <a href="https://www.tribunnews.com/regional/2019/11/20/terima-red-notice-interpol-warga-inggrisdavid-mueller-bakal-dideportasi?page=all">told reporters yesterday.</a></p>
      <p>The 30-year-old, who is allegedly on the run from the UK police for dealing illegal steroids, was <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/british-model-on-the-run-from-uk-police-arrested-in-bali-local-police-allegedly-find-self-produced-porn-videos-on-his-phone/">arrested in Bali back in July</a>, where police found a bong, used syringes and steroids among his belongings. Authorities also said Murrell had overstayed his visa by more than 150 days.</p>
      <p>In addition, pornographic content, allegedly of his own making, was found on his mobile phone, contents of which reportedly showed him engaging in “sexual deviation,” including with dogs and fish, Amran had said at the time.</p>
      <p>However, it appears that the collected evidence is insufficient to prosecute Mueller, and he is only charged with a violation of the immigration law for overstaying his visa.</p>
      <p>“So Terrence, based on our coordination with the police, [we conclude] that his drug use is difficult to prove because the results were not strong enough. The videos also appear to be a private collection,” Amran said.</p>
