      <p>Daimler's electric sports utility vehicle will face competition from Tesla Inc's Model Y SUV, which starts at a price of US$39,000 and will be available in 2021.</p>
      <p>Daimler in September reiterated its plan to have up to 10 electrified car variants by 2022, and Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche said he hoped the EQC and other electric cars would account for 15per cent to 25per cent of its sales by 2025.</p>
