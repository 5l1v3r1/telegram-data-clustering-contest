      <p>TOKYO, Nov 21 — Japan’s ruling coalition lawmakers have called for an extra budget that would include US$92 billion (RM383 billion) in spending to support slowing growth, party officials said today, raising worries about straining public finances.</p>
      <p>The agreement, made in a meeting between senior officials of Japan’s ruling coalition yesterday, highlights the concern among lawmakers about the economic outlook thanks to a sales tax hike in October and slowing global demand.</p>
      <p>“Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe told us to compile a sizable package to take all possible steps on the economy,” Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told a news conference yetserday.</p>
      <p>“We want to craft a strong economic package, taking into account the economic situation, global economy and damage caused by typhoons, which were larger than last year, so as to get the economy on a solid growth path.”</p>
      <p>However, analysts have doubts about Abe’s ability to spend such a large amount given Japan’s government debt, which is twice the size of its US$5 trillion economy and the industrial world’s heaviest public debt burden.</p>
      <p>“Even if the government secured a budget for big public works, it would be difficult to implement it smoothly,” said Kiichi Murashima, economist at Citigroup Global Markets Japan.</p>
      <p>“Chances are low for the government to compile a supplementary budget worth ¥10 trillion yen (US$92.19 billion). We expect the size of this fiscal year’s extra budget to fall short of ¥5 trillion.”</p>
      <p>The government will compile a supplementary budget for the current fiscal year ending March 2020, as well as next fiscal year’s budget plan in December, allowing funds to be disbursed over a 15-month period, sources said.</p>
      <p>Both budget drafts need parliamentary approval to take effect.</p>
      <p>Supplementary budgets of more than ¥10 trillion have only been compiled four times in the past, including after Japan’s devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011.</p>
      <p>The ruling bloc’s requests focus on spending for disaster relief from a string of typhoons that struck Japan earlier this year and funding to help farmers cope with fallout from a US-Japan trade deal that opens some markets to US goods, the <i>Nikkei </i>business daily reported today.</p>
      <p>“We need a huge supplementary budget sized at least around ¥10 trillion,” Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party’s (LDP) heavyweight Toshihiro Nikai was quoted as saying yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Japan’s economic outlook has become uncertain due to the impact from the sales tax hike, natural disasters and the US-China trade friction,” Yosuke Takagi, a senior official of the LDP’s ruling coalition partner the Komeito party, was quoted as saying after the meeting. — Reuters</p>
