      <h1>Steyer, Biden clash over climate credentials</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:40:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-beitsch" target="_blank">Rebecca Beitsch</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> went toe-to-toe with billionaire <a href="https://thehill.com/people/thomas-tom-steyer">Tom Steyer</a> over their climate credentials during the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Steyer, who has sought to brand himself as the climate candidate, said he would use his presidential powers to declare the climate crisis an emergency on his first day in office. </p>
      <p>“I am the only person on this stage who will say climate is the No. 1 priority for me,” Steyer said.</p>
      <p>That touched a nerve with Biden, who said, "I don’t need a lecture from my friend." He went on to add that climate change is "the existential threat" and "the No. 1 issue."</p>

      <p>But Steyer challenged Biden, who spent nearly four decades in the Senate, and the other lawmakers onstage, saying, “Congress has never passed an important climate bill ever.” </p>
      <p>“This is a problem which continues to get worse. That’s why I’m saying it’s a state of emergency,” Steyer added.</p>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) jumped in to note that in July he introduced a bill with Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> (D-N.Y.) to declare a <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/452214-aoc-sanders-lead-call-for-a-climate-emergency-declaration">climate change emergency</a>.</p>
