      <p>MUMBAI: It's a day Children’s Welfare school would like to forget in a hurry. The school from Andheri ‘achieved’ a dubious record in history books when all its batsmen were out for a duck in their <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harris-Shield">Harris Shield</a> first round knockout match against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Swami-Vivekanand-International-School">Swami Vivekanand International School</a> (SVIS), Borivali.</p>
      <p>Thanks to seven extras (six wides and one bye) bowled by the SVIS bowlers, Children’s Welfare managed to aggregate 7, as they were all out in merely six overs. The wrecker-in-chief for SVIS was medium-pacer Alok Pal, who took six for three in three overs. Skipper Varod Vaze took two for three, while the other two batsmen were run out.</p>

      <p>The pathetic effort with the bat saw Children’s Welfare lose the match by an unbelievable margin of 754 runs! Surely, it must be the heaviest defeat in the history of the traditional inter-school <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">cricket</a> tournament. Batting first at the New Era ground in Azad Maidan, SVIS, fired by an unbeaten triple hundred from Meet Mayekar (338 not out, 134b, 56x4, 7x6) had made 761 for four in 39 overs.</p>
      <p>This tally includes a 156-run penalty imposed on Children’s Welfare bowlers for being six overs short in the stipulated three-hour time, where they were supposed to bowl 45 overs. Krishna Parte (95) and Ishan Roy (67) too helped SVIS plunder the opposition bowling.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Obviously, SVIS coach Mahesh Lotilkar was delighted with his team’s dominant performance on the day, which came even as their captain, Ayush Jethwa, and two other top players are away in the Mumbai Under-16 team camp.</p>
      <p>“It was one of those days when we were outstanding in all the departments of the game. All three of our medium-pacers are very good. They and Meet have a bright future for Mumbai. However, this was just the first round. I don’t want the boys to relax after this massive win,” Lotilkar said.</p>
      <p>Among the school’s alumni is India’s superstar batsman Rohit Sharma. If he does see the scoreboard of this match, one is sure that Rohit would afford himself a smile. If ever there was a ‘perfect game’ in cricket, Swami Vivekanand enjoyed one on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The farcical nature of the contest, though, make you wonder if it is sensible to make such strong teams play against infinitely weaker sides, even if it is just the first round of the competition.</p>
      <p>“These kind of heavily one-sided matches tend to happen in the first and second round. Some of the schools just don’t pick teams properly, provide net practice or other facilities to their boys,” lamented MCA apex council member Nadeem Memon.</p>
      <p><b>Brief Scores:</b> SVIS 761/4 in 39 overs (Meet Mayekar 338 not out, Krishna Parte 95, Ishan Roy 67) beat Children's Welfare 7 (Alok Pal 6/3, Varod Vaze 2/3) by 754 runs</p>
