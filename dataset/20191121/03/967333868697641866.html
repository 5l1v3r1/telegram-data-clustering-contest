        <b>UNITED NATIONS (Sputnik) - Former Bolivian President Evo Morales has not yet reached out to the United Nations to request assistance in returning from Mexico, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"No, I am not aware of any specific request", Dujarric said on Wednesday, responding to whether the organization <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911211077363580-evo-morales-seeks-international-assistance-for-bolivia-return/">had been asked to provide for such help</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Earlier in the day, Morales asked international mediators for assistance in returning from Mexico, where he was granted political asylum, to Bolivia.</blockquote>
      <p>Bolivia plunged into crisis following the presidential election on 20 October, which saw Morales secure his fourth term in the first round.</p>
      <p>However, the opposition refused to accept the vote results, citing alleged irregularities in the vote-counting process, which were subsequently confirmed by the Organization of American States.</p>
      <p>On 10 November, the Bolivian military <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911201077356924-several-ex-ministers-of-morales-govt-denied-permission-to-leave-bolivia---reports/">urged Morales to step down</a> for the sake of the country's stability.</p>
      <p>As a result, he resigned the same day and left for Mexico after being granted political asylum. Bolivia's highest-ranking officials resigned as well.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jeanine Anez, the opposition deputy speaker of the upper house, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911161077321166-five-pro-morales-protesters-killed-in-clashes-in-bolivia---reports/">declared herself the country's interim president</a>. The Bolivian Constitutional Court has recognized her claim as legitimate.</p>
