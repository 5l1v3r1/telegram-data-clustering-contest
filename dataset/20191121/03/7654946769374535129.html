      <h1>Buttigieg rises to top of New Hampshire polls — amid surge in Iowa, too</h1>

      <p>It’s a Buttigi-Edge!</p>
      <p>Pete Buttigieg has skyrocketed to the lead in New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary polling, a new survey out Wednesday reveals.</p>
      <p>The South Bend, Indiana, mayor grabbed 25% of support of primary voters in the Saint Anselm College Poll — up 15 points from a previous survey in September. Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden are tied for second at 15%, followed by Bernie Sanders with 9%.</p>
      <p>The results are disappointing for Sanders, the senator from neighboring Vermont, who easily defeated Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 Democratic primary.</p>
      <p>The survey also found Amy Klobuchar with the support of 6% of voters, Tom Steyer at 5%, Tulsi Gabbard and Cory Booker with 3% each, Andrew Yang with 2% and Kamala Harris at 1%.</p>
      <p>The race is fluid, with only 36% of primary voters in the Granite State saying they are firm in their choice and 57% saying they could change their mind.</p>
      <p>“Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76% having a favorable impression of him versus only 11% unfavorable,” said Neil Levesque, the executive director of Saint Anselm’s New Hampshire Institute of Politics.</p>
      <p>“His net favorable of 65% easily bests the field, including Biden [31%] and Warren [39%].”</p>
      <p>The poll queried 512 registered New Hampshire voters — including 255 who expressed interest in voting in the upcoming Democratic primary — from Nov. 13-18. The survey has a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points.</p>
      <p>The New Hampshire primary is Feb. 11, the second voting state after the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses — where the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend has gained significant ground in recent months.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg scored 25% in the latest CNN/Des Moines Register poll of the Hawkeye State, giving him a 9-point lead over the field.</p>
      <p>His top-tier competitors were bunched together, with Warren landing 16% in the poll while Biden and Sanders were tied with 15%.</p>
      <p>That’s a gain of 16 percentage points from the 9% that Buttigieg had in that poll in September, while Warren dropped 6 points and Biden slipped 5 points.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg’s campaign is heavily invested in Iowa and has more than 100 staffers and 20 offices across the state, among the most of any candidate.</p>
      <p>His campaign has sought to build on that advantage with TV ads touting his military credentials, including his tour in Afghanistan as a naval intelligence officer.</p>
      <p>His aides are betting that a strong finish in Iowa will help quell questions about whether the small-city mayor is ready for the big stage and persuade reluctant black voters to give him a second look.</p>
      <p>African American voters — a key block in the Democratic primaries — still heavily favor Biden, the former vice president, despite his disappointing debate performances, polls show.</p>
