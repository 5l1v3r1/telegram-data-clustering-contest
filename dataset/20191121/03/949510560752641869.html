      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge says he’ll rule by the end of the year on the constitutionality of Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in New York courthouses.</p>
      <p>Judge Jed Rakoff set the deadline for himself after expressing skepticism toward the federal government’s assertions that its policies regarding courthouse arrests can’t be reviewed by a federal judge. Rakoff said he found the claim “unusual and extraordinary.”</p>
      <p>Wednesday’s hearing concerned a lawsuit brought earlier this year by New York’s attorney general, the Brooklyn district attorney and several immigrant advocates’ groups.</p>
      <p>The plaintiffs contend ICE arrests in courthouses have skyrocketed since President Donald Trump took office.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for ICE urged Rakoff to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Rakoff said he has not yet decided the legal issues but finds them fascinating.</p>
