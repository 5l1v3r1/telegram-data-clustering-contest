      <h1>Scott Morrison Reckons That Australia Is “Overachieving” On Climate Change</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:00:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Conaghan</a></address>
      <p>Not to worry, Australia: our country is an “overachiever” on climate change action, according to Scott Morrison.</p>
      <p>He also says there is “no credible scientific evidence” that cutting our emissions would have impacted on our current bushfire season.</p>
      <p>Good to know we can all relax.</p>

      <p>The Prime Minister made the comments on the ABC’s <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/am/11706474">AM program</a>, as millions of people across the east coast woke up to thick smoke blanketing their towns.</p>
      <p>“If anything, Australia is an overachiever on our commitments,” he told presenter Sabra Lane.</p>

      <p>As evidence, he highlighted our <a href="https://junkee.com/one-year-paris-hows-malcolm-going-climate-commitments/90681">Kyoto targets</a>, which were set as part of an international agreement to reduce emissions. But using these targets to highlight the “great work Australia is doing” is ironic, considering they’ve been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/australias-kyoto-loophole-eight-times-larger-than-entire-pacific-emissions">criticised for being unambitious at best.</a></p>

      <p>Morrison did go on to acknowledge that climate change is making our problems worse … while still somehow being in denial about our role in it.</p>

      <p>“The contribution of these issues to global weather conditions and to conditions here in Australia are known and acknowledged,” he said. “Climate change is a global phenomenon and we’re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change.”</p>
      <p>“I think to suggest with just 1.3% of global emissions that Australia doing something differently, something more or less, would have changed the fire outcome this season, I don’t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.”</p>
      <p>Government figures show our carbon emissions continue to rise.</p>
      <p>Oh, and Morrison also said he didn’t meet the <a href="https://junkee.com/government-climate-change-bushfires/229803">23 former fire chiefs</a> who wanted to discuss climate change, because the government already knew how bad the upcoming fire season would be, and had been preparing.</p>
