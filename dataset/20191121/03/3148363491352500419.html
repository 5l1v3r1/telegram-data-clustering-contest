      <p>“We shouldn’t have to pay farmers to take the edge off a trade war that should not have started in the first place,” Pete Buttigieg said during the fifth Democrat debate.</p>
      <p>The South Bend mayor commented in response to a question from MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow, who asked him if he would keep President Trump’s subsidies in place if elected president.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think this president cares one bit about farmers,” Buttigieg claimed. “He keeps asking them to take one for the team … they’re not going to benefit from business as usual from the president.”</p>
      <p>A November survey from Iowa State University showed that farmers largely <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/why-farmers-still-support-trump">view</a> the trade disruption from Trump’s fight with China as short-term pain for long-term gain.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg went on to discuss how to help farmers combat climate change by building “climate-neutral farms” before he was interrupted.</p>
      <p>Maddow pressed Buttigieg to say whether or not he would still support Trump’s subsidies for farms.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” he replied. “But we won’t need them because we’re going to fix the trade war.”</p>
