      <p>A detained British national linked with the controversial Irish firm, Process and Industrial Developments Limited (P&amp;ID) and its affiliates in Nigeria, James Nolan, has asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to vary and relax the conditions attached to the bail granted him.</p>
      <p>Nolan made the request in a fresh motion pending before the court.</p>
      <p>He claimed not to have been able to meet the conditions set by the court for his bail.</p>
      <p>The Briton said the conditions include that he produce a serving senator who is not standing trial, as his surety was stringent.</p>
      <p>Nolan, said to be a signatory to accounts of P&amp;ID) Nigeria, the In-Country Support Manager of P&amp;ID, Virgin Island and other organisations, was arraigned on a 16-count charge on October 21, 2019.</p>
      <p>He was, in the charge filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), accused of engaging in money laundering, tax evasion, forgery of immigration documents, running a trafficking syndicate and involved in corrupting Nigerian officials.</p>
      <p>Nolan pleaded not guilty to the charge, which has him, Adam Quinn (said to be on the run), two firms in which they are said to be directors – Goidel Resources Limited, a Designated Non-Financial Institution (DNFI) and ICIL Limited – listed as defendants.</p>
      <p>Following their arraignment on October 21, and Nolan’s plea of not guilty, Justice Abang ordered the Briton, who was the only available natural being among the defendants, to be remanded in prison pending the consideration of his bail application.</p>

      <p>The court, on November 7, 2019, granted him conditional bail and ordered that he remain in prison custody until he meets the conditions on which the bail was granted.</p>
      <p>In his ruling on the bail application, Justice Okon Abang admitted the applicant to bail at N500 million with one surety at the same amount.</p>
      <p>The judge added that the surety must be a Nigerian and a serving senator, who is not standing criminal trial in any court in the country.</p>
      <p>“The senator must have a landed property fully developed in Maitama District of Abuja and fully certified by the FCDA.”</p>
      <p>“The surety must submit two passport photographs,” Justice Abang said.</p>
      <p>He averred that the surety must submit a three-year tax clearance certificate and sign an undertaking to always be present in court with the defendant throughout the duration of the trial.</p>
      <p>The surety, the judge added, must depose to an affidavit of means with two passport photographs and undertake to pay the total bail sum, should the defendant escape from the country before the conclusion of his trial.</p>
      <p>He said where the surety fails to meet the conditions, the bail would be withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Justice Abanag also ordered the defendant to surrender all his international passports, and directed the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) to confirm how many passports have been issued to the defendant within the last 20 years.</p>
      <p>At yesterday’s resumed hearing in the matter, defence lawyer Paul Erokoro (SAN) drew the court’s attention to the fresh motion seeking variation of the bail conditions.</p>
      <p>Erokoro applied for an adjournment to enable the court rule on the defendant’s fresh motion and to afford the defendant sufficient time and opportunity to prepare for his defence.</p>
      <p>Prosecution lawyer Ekele Iheanacho objected to an adjournment and argued that it was in the best interest of justice to allow the prosecution conduct its case because it has two witnesses in court.</p>
      <p>Iheanacho argued that the constitutional requirement that a defendant be afforded sufficient time and facilities to prepare for his/her defence did not include that such a defendant must be granted bail and that he/she cannot brief his lawyer while in custody.</p>
      <p>Ruling, Justice Abang upheld Iheanacho’s argument and ordered the prosecution to open its case.</p>
      <p>The judge added that the defendant has had sufficient time to prepare for his defence, having been granted bail.</p>
      <p>Iheanacho proceeded to call the prosecution’s first witness, an official of the GTBank, Agunbiade Adewale Akinseye, who acknowledged that the two firms standing trial with Nolan -Goidel Resources and ICIL Ltd – maintain accounts with his bank.</p>
      <p>Akinseye, through whom the prosecution tendered documents relating to the accounts, including account opening packages, account statements, among others, gave evidence on some transactions carried out in the accounts.</p>
      <p>He said his bank complied with the necessary requirements before opening the accounts, but that Goidel Resources that could not provide the required certificate from the Special Control Against Money Laundering (SCUML).</p>
      <p>He said Nolan was a signatory to both companies’ accounts and that, at one point or the other, he (the defendant) made payments into the accounts.</p>
      <p>Erokoro, who commenced the cross-examination of the witness could not conclude, because he insisted on being furnished with a copy of the statement the witness made to investigators at the EFCC.</p>
      <p>While Iheanacho promised to provide Erokoro with a copy of the statement later on Wednesday, Justice Abang adjourned proceedings till Thursday.</p>
      <p>Before adjourning, the judge ordered the prison authorities to allow Nolan access to his lawyers during the official time to enable him properly brief his legal team.</p>
