      <h1>Star Wars 2022 Movie Has a New Director; Jon Favreau to Lead the Charge?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:56:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/dashran/" target="_blank">Dashran Yohan</a></address>
      <p>December is almost approaching and I can feel the excitement and energy in the air once again. No, not because of Christmas, but because of Star Wars. The ninth and final chapter of the Skywalker Saga, <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>, hits cinemas this 19 December 2019 and will see the culmination of a story that spanned multiple generations. The question is, what next? Where do we go from here?</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, we reported that <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198514/star-wars-films-hiatus/">Disney CEO Bob Iger had mentioned that Star Wars big screen releases will go on hiatus until further notice</a>. This came at the heels of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss exiting the galaxy far far away to focus on a slew of Netflix projects.</p>
      <p>However, it looks like that might not be the case. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-uncertainty-extends-kathleen-kennedys-disney-future-1256357"><b>THR</b></a>, we <b>will still be getting a Star Wars film in 2022. Lucasfilm president has apparently found a director, but will only announce who that is in January 2020.</b> However, for those hoping that it would be a Rian Johnson film, unfortunately, we have to keep on hoping. Sources tell THR that the 2022 film will not be by <i>The Last Jedi </i>filmmaker Rian Johnson. If I’m being honest with myself, I don’t think we’re getting another Rian Johnson Star Wars film.</p>

      <p>What’s particularly interesting about the THR report is that it looks like <b>Jon Favreau, who’s the creator of <i>The Mandalorian</i> as well as the visionary director of <i>Iron Man, The Jungle Book </i>and <i>The Lion King</i>, will seemingly have a lot of say over the future of Star Wars.</b> It’s currently unknown if Lucasfilm will make Favreau the creative head of the Star Wars universe slightly similar to Kevin Feige’s role in Marvel Studios. Another key player that might join Favreau is Dave Filoni, the veteran animation director and George Lucas’ protege.</p>
