      <h1>Former South Carolina deputy arrested for sex with teen in patrol car</h1>

      <p>A former deputy assigned to a South Carolina high school — and former basketball player at the University of South Carolina — was arrested Wednesday for having sex with a 17-year-old student in his patrol car.</p>
      <p>Jamel Bradley, 40, who was fired from Richmond County Sheriff’s office in October, is also the target of a federal lawsuit alleging he had a sexual relationship with another student at Spring Valley High School in Columbia.</p>
      <p>Wednesday’s arrest of Bradley stemmed from an incident last year that happened off-campus, his former Sheriff, Leon Lott, said.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to kill you, but I can’t do that,” Sheriff Lott said about his former deputy. “I really would. It just disgusts me.”</p>
      <p>Lott said investigators are probing whether Bradley victimized other students since his 2007 hiring. The federal lawsuit against Bradley contains such allegations.</p>
      <p>“It’s still a very active investigation. But we felt like he needed to be arrested and he needed to be arrested today,” Lott said.</p>
      <p>Bradley scored a record three pointers while playing for the NCAA team from 1998 to 2002.</p>
      <p>He was charged with third-degree criminal sexual conduct. He was fired earlier this year for lying and tampering with an internal investigation into his actions.</p>
      <p>Included in the suit is a case where a cheerleading coach from a different high school told authorities that Bradley may be inappropriately touching a cheerleader.</p>
