      <h1>Apple, Intel file antitrust case against SoftBank-backed firm over lawsuits</h1>
      <h2>The suit follows an earlier case filed by Intel against Fortress in October which it withdrew and filed a new suit on Wednesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:27:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:27</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-apple-inc">Apple Inc </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/intel-corp">Intel Corp </a>on Wednesday filed an antitrust lawsuit against <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>Group Corp-owned Fortress Investment Group, alleging the firm stockpiled patents to hold up technology <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>with lawsuits demanding as much as $5.1 billion from Apple.</p>
      <p>The suit follows an earlier case filed by Intel against Fortress in October. Intel withdrew that suit and on Wednesday filed a new version in the US District Court for the Northern District of California with Apple also joining as a plaintiff.</p>
      <p>In the filing on Wednesday, Apple said that a group of firms connected to Fortress had filed at least 25 lawsuits against the iPhone maker, asking for between $2.6 billion and $5.1 billion in damages from the iPhone maker. One of the suits, Apple wrote in its filing, alleged that Apple violated a step-counting patent in its devices with health-tracking apps.</p>
      <p>Two Fortress-connected firms, Uniloc USA and Uniloc Luxembourg, "have disclosed that they believe they are entitled to damages of between $1.41 and $2.75 per Apple product, for total damages in the range of $375 to $732 million," Apple wrote in its complaint. "The apparent precision of the per-unit damages request is a facade; Uniloc USA and Uniloc Luxembourg simply adopted the amounts that Apple sought from Samsung in litigation for Apple's patents."</p>
      <p>Intel said it could not comment beyond the court filing, and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Fortress did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But when Intel filed a similar lawsuit in October, a Fortress spokesman told Reuters the company was "confident in our business practices and our legal position and view this lawsuit as meritless."</p>
