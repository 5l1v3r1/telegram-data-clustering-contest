      <p>Tanzania has been picked as an example in the campaign, citing its good land laws which include equal land rights to both genders.<br/>Speaking to reporters yesterday chairman of the campaign Tike Mwambipile who is also the managing director of Tanzania Women Lawyers Association (TAWLA) said the campaign will be unveiled by the Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Minister Ummy Mwalimu.</p>
      <p>She said despite having in place land laws there are some issues dragging their implementation, whilst women continue to suffer economic and social hardship by being denied their rights due to traditional and cultural considerations.</p>
      <p>Mwambipile said: “Tanzania is the first country to conduct the campaign because it has good land laws, and globally it will be assisted by Landesa Tanzania, Habitat for Humanity, Huairou Commission and the World Bank.”</p>
      <p>She said the civil society in the country will conduct deep analysis aimed at bringing changes in land ownership between women and men.</p>
      <p>She said the campaign will be conducted by 26 NGOs that deal with land issues and will be coordinated by Landesa Tanzania.<br/>She said the aim of the campaign is to fill the existing vacuum between policy, laws and traditional practice within the Tanzania society including changing the society’s mindset in oppressive customs.</p>
      <p>The director of Tanzania Media Women Association (TAMWA) Rose Reuben said the media has a big role to play in filling that vacuum by carrying news that educate the importance of equal land ownership instead of discriminating women.</p>
      <p>She said: family lands are sold without regard to women, hence we in the media should fully participate to make the campaign a success to remove that oppression.”</p>
      <p>Resident director of Landesa Tanzania Dr Monica Mhoja said bad customs have contributed in making many women pathetic in fighting for their rights including owning land.</p>
      <p>She added: “If we join forces through this campaign and if it will succeed it will help in reducing widows’ anguish, hence we must cooperate to ensure the existing land laws are put into practice.”</p>
