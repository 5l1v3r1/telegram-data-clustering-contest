      <h1>‘Lies and smears and innuendos': Gabbard responds to Harris attacks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:03:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:03</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>After Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard tore into the Democratic establishment, California Sen. Kamala Harris attacked her and said it was “unfortunate” she was even running.</p>
      <p>Gabbard, 38, said she was running to be the antithesis to the “Bush-Clinton-Trump” style of foreign policy and ripped candidates such as former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who recently implied she was a “Russian asset.”</p>
      <p>Harris, 55, responded by saying that Gabbard shouldn’t even be on the stage along with the other nine contenders.</p>
      <p>“I think that it’s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years full-time on Fox News criticizing President Obama,” Harris said to applause.</p>
      <p>She then accused the Hawaii congresswoman of meeting with President Trump and for failing to hold a stronger stance against Syrian strongman Bashar Assad.</p>
      <p>“What we need on the stage in November is someone who has the ability to win,” she continued. “And by that, we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump, and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition and bring the party and the nation together.”</p>
      <p>Gabbard responded, “What Senator Harris is doing is, unfortunately, continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I’m making, the leadership and the change that I’m seeking to bring in our foreign policy."</p>
      <p>“Which only makes me guess that she will, as president, continue the status quo, continue the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive,” she added.</p>
      <p>Gabbard also pointed to her military service and said that she would “put the interests of the American people” above everything else.</p>

      <p>Harris is polling at 4.3%, to the RealClearPolitics national <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html">average</a> of polls, while Gabbard is registering 2% support.</p>
