      <p>On Wednesday night during the fifth 2020 Democratic debate, the tech entrepreneur <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-andrew-yang-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Andrew Yang</a> was asked what he would say to Russian President Vladimir Putin in their first conversation if he were elected.</p>
      <p>In a jab at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">President Donald Trump</a> and Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, Yang said: "Well, first of all I'd say, 'I'm sorry I beat your guy.'"</p>
      <p>The remark prompted laughter in the debate hall.</p>

      <p>The US intelligence community concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to bolster Trump's chances of winning and did so under Putin's orders.</p>
      <p>"Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election," according to <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf">a January 2017 intelligence assessment</a> from the CIA, the National Security Agency, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</p>
      <p>Trump has repeatedly expressed doubts about Russian election interference, and his skepticism is now linked, in part, to the central concerns of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-major-players-timeline-what-comes-next-2019-11">House impeachment inquiry</a>.</p>
      <p>The president in a July 25 phone call urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch investigations into former <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Vice President Joe Biden</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gop-conspiracy-theories-about-trump-ukraine-bogus-2019-11">debunked conspiracy theory</a> claiming it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sondland-laura-cooper-hale-impeachment-testimony-key-takeaways-2019-11">There were two impeachment hearings</a> on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, with the second ending shortly before the debate began.</p>
      <p>Yang, who's not a 2020 frontrunner but has seen an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-2020-democratic-candidate-universal-basic-income-fake-news-2019-3">unexpected level of success</a> in the race so far, has said he supports impeaching Trump. "We're a country of laws. You have to enforce the laws," <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1177312391677145088?s=20">Yang said</a> in a late-September interview on ABC's "The View."</p>
