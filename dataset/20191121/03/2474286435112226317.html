      <p>Moree residents will soon have the opportunity to get fit and active when a free outdoor fitness program comes to town.</p>
      <p>Moree Plains Shire Council has received funding from the Hunter New England Central Coast Primary Health Network through the Australian government's PHN program to bring the Live Life Get Active (LLGA) program to Moree.</p>
      <p>LLGA is a nationwide charity which aims to get people up, moving and having fun in a group setting in a local park. It raises awareness of people's health, lifestyle behaviours and encourages them to review their eating habits.</p>
      <p>The program provides it's members with free daily activity camps, professionally tailored nutritional programs and face-to-face personal fitness coaching, which all support a true path of positive change.</p>

      <p>CEO Amanda King said the camps are fun, welcoming, non-intimidating and are highly effective.</p>
      <p>"We work with all ages and all abilities, and the number one rule is to have fun," she said.</p>
      <p>"Our camps are for real people. Our trainers are highly qualified, recruited locally and are there to help develop a path of change.</p>
      <p>"We believe daily exercise in the park is as much about the mind as it is about the body."</p>
      <p>Along with the provision of daily camps, LLGA will also send each registered member their own free professionally tailored nutritional program including weekly easy-to-follow recipes, videos and blogs that can be made on a real budget.</p>
      <p>"I love the program and its absolutely brilliant," LLGA member, Lauren Geier said.</p>
      <p>"The camp has a wonderful atmosphere and no judgement at all - 10 out of 10. I have been recommending it to friends and family since I first went."</p>
      <p>The Moree program will launch at Jellicoe Park on Wednesday, December 4.</p>
      <p>From then on, the fun and free fitness camps will run two times a day - 7am and 9.30am - from Monday to Friday.</p>
      <p>The camps will operate during school terms and each session will last for 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>The weekly schedule is made up of boxing, cross training and yoga. This variety works on developing good cardio, improved strength, toning, balance and flexibility. All equipment is supplied.</p>
