        <b>It was in April 2019 that Arjun Rampal and Mehr Jesia moved to court to seek divorce. A few months after living separately, they have been granted a divorce by the family court</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arjun Rampal and Mehr Jesia who lived together for almost 20 years moved to the family court last year to file for a divorce. Since their marriage falls under the Special Marriage Act, they had to stay separately for almost a year to get the divorce. Now, Principal judge Shailaja Sawan of Bandra Family Court has granted the divorce to the couple on Tuesday. Reportedly, the divorce has been sought through mutual consent and the custody of their two daughters now lies with Mehr.</p>
      <p>A report in Mumbai Mirror suggests that Mehr and Arjun filed for a divorce in the month of April 2019 and nearly after six months after filing for it, the judge has dissolved their marriage. Their two daughters, Myra and Mahikaa, will reside with their mother in a duplex apartment whereas Arjun moved out of their home last year to live in a rented 2BHK apartment.</p>
      <p>When they announced their separation in 2018, they had released a joint statement that read, "After a 20-year-long beautiful journey filled with love and beautiful memories, we would like to share, that all journeys have different paths. We feel that it is time for us to move on to different destinations henceforth."
