      <p>The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Energia Limited, Mr. Leste Aihevba, has charged companies to comply with the provisions of the law, as the landscape of doing business becomes more dynamic. He stated this in his welcome address at a Business Support Workshop themed ‘Partnership That Works’ for its community vendors in Kwale, Ndokwa West Council of Delta State.</p>
      <p>The event was designed to educate and assist the company’s community vendors and contractors to obtain the necessary permits and learn the proper process for taxation and all other requirements for oil and gas vendors based on the Nigerian law.</p>
      <p>The workshop was a joint venture (JV) between Energia and Oando to help Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs) in business registration and tax compliance.</p>
      <p>On hand to facilitate the workshop were experts from the Delta State Internal Revenue (DSIRS), the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and a tax management consultant from Ascension, who were brought in by the Joint Venture to go through the processes with the vendors, to ensure that the participants fully understood the requirements and were fully compliant with the law.</p>
      <p>The MD’s statement was echoed by the representative of the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Oando Energy Resources, Mrs. Nwando Ihyembe-Hassan (JV Asset Manager), who added: “This workshop is a step in the right direction to arm you with the knowledge, certification and permits you require to succeed in your various endeavours as oil and gas vendors.”</p>
      <p>The event was interactive, with many questions from the participants adequately dealt with by the facilitators and representatives of the JV.The attendees appreciated the first-of-its-kind initiative aimed at empowering them to be better entrepreneurs.One of the participants stated, “This is a first of its kind and the community is grateful to Energia and Oando for the knowledge that they have imparted.”</p>
      <p>The ceremony ended with some of the vendors being given a certificate of participation and commitment to secure their DPR permit alongside other documentation, which certified them as fully compliant oil and gas vendors in accordance with the law within a month.</p>
