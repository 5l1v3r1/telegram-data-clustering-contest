      <p>“Talks between our two countries are progressing well. When they will be concluded successfully, we shall sign a protocol hopefully in Dodoma in the near future and Tanzania will receive over five billion/. This money will go to projects mitigating effects of climate change,” the minister said.</p>

      <p>He praised the government’s efforts in protecting environment, saying banning of plastic carrier bags was a very positive move in protecting environment.</p>
      <p>According to the document made public during the occasion, cooperation between the two countries will include capacity building, technology transfer and technical assistance, exchange of experts and trainees, organisation of delegation visits, joint organisation of workshops, seminars and meetings, promotion of private sector participation and activities to implement public-<br/>private sector partnerships and development of fund-raising capacities with regard to global climate change and sustainable development.</p>
