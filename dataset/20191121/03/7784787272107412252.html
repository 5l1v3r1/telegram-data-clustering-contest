      <h3>Citroen is leaving the World Rally Championship with immediate effect after six-times world champion Sebastien Ogier announced his departure from the team, the French manufacturer said on Wednesday.</h3>
      <p>Citroen Racing said it had made the decision “due to the absence of a first-class driver available for (the) 2020 season” but commercial factors were also a major consideration.</p>
      <p><i>Motorsport.com</i> said Ogier was expected to be announced as a Toyota driver on Monday.</p>
      <p>Toyota’s Estonian Ott Tanak won the driver’s title in Spain last month, ending Ogier’s six-year reign, but announced four days later that he was joining Hyundai for 2020.</p>

      <p>Hyundai secured the manufacturers’ crown <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/rally/rally-australia-cancelled-wrc-2019-nsw-fires-nsw-bushfire-today/news-story/27fa8a94ffbe3d5557491128a6a2ab70">when this month’s season-ending Australian race was called off due to the threat of bushfires</a>.</p>
      <p>“Our decision to withdraw from WRC programme as early as end of 2019 follows on Sebastien Ogier’s choice to leave Citroen Racing,” said Citroen chief executive Linda Jackson.</p>
      <p>“We obviously have not wished this situation but we could not imagine 2020 season without Sebastien.”</p>
