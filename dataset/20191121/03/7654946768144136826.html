      <h1>MCC prison guard willing to dish on Epstein death, cooperate with IG probe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:39:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:39</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Saul, Alex Taylor and Bruce Golding</a></address>
      <p>A Manhattan prison guard <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/lawyer-for-mcc-guard-tova-noel-says">is willing to cooperate with a federal investigation</a> into Jeffrey Epstein’s death — even though she’s been accused of goofing off while he hanged himself, her lawyer said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Tova Noel “did not make any efforts to frustrate the Government’s investigation” following Epstein’s jailhouse suicide, defense lawyer Jason Foy said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“In fact, Ms. Noel remains available to fully and truthfully cooperate with the Inspector General’s investigation, which is also geared toward uncovering the many problems that existed from the commencement of her employment [and] which continue to plague the Metropolitan Correctional Center.”</p>
      <p>Foy didn’t respond to a message asking what sort of info Noel could provide.</p>
      <p>Noel also <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/prison-guards-released-on-100k-bond-in-jeffrey-epstein-suicide-case/">ignored questions from The Post</a> when she bolted from her Bronx apartment building and hopped into a waiting Toyota Prius shortly before 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>Noel, 31, and fellow guard Michael Thomas, 41, were <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/2-jail-guards-indicted-in-connection-to-jeffrey-epsteins-death/">indicted Tuesday</a> on charges of conspiracy and filing false reports for allegedly fudging “count slips” while failing for hours to check on Epstein and other inmates in the MCC’s ninth-floor Special Housing Unit.</p>
      <p>They finally found the notorious pedophile hanging in his cell when they delivered his breakfast at 6:30 a.m. Aug. 10, according to the Manhattan federal indictment.</p>
      <p>Also Wednesday, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/ex-us-attorney-calls-epstein-suicide-more-than-coincidental/">a former United States attorney said</a> “you have to be concerned” about Epstein’s suicide, which he called “more than coincidental.”</p>
      <p>Former Utah US Attorney Brett Tolman told “Fox &amp; Friends” that the guards’ alleged misconduct could be “just a dereliction of duty.”</p>
      <p>“But you would have to look at it in a vacuum … and ignore everything else that’s gone on with this case against Epstein,” he said.</p>
