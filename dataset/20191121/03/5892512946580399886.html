      <h1>UFC 245: Referee, judging assignments set for trio of title fights on Dec. 14 in Las Vegas</h1>

      <p>Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) has announced the referee and judging assignments for the upcoming UFC 245 pay-per-view (PPV) event, set for Dec 14, 2019 inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, which features a trio of title fights.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-245-judges-referees-kamaru-usman-colby-covington-max-holloway">MMA Junkie</a>, Marc Goddard will serve as the referee for the Welterweight title fight between division king, Kamaru Usman, and No. 1 contender, Colby Covington. Furthermore, Derek Cleary, Sal D’Amato and Eric Colon have been tasked as judges for the main event.</p>
      <p>In the co-headlining act, Featherweight champion, Max Holloway, will defend his title against Alex Volkanovski, which will be officiated by Jason Herzog, who will be the man in the middle for a UFC title fight for the first time. According to the report, Mike Bell, Junichiro Kamijo and Chris Lee will be the judges.</p>
      <p>Also, Keith Peterson will be the official in the middle when UFC champ-champ, Amanda Nunes, puts her Bantamweight title on the line against Germaine De Randamie. The judges for that title fight will be Dave Hagen, Ron McCarthy and D’Amato.</p>
      <p>Aside from the three championship bouts, the main card will be rounded out by two intriguing Bantamweight fights as Marlon Moraes welcomes Jose Aldo to the division, while Petr Yan looks for a big win over Urijah Faber.</p>
