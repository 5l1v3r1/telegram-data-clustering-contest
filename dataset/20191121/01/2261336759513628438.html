      <p>If things keep trending the way they have been, it looks like Conor McGregor won’t be ranked at pound-for-pound any more pretty soon.</p>
      <p>The former two-division champion hasn’t competed since losing to Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229, and while things are trending towards an early 2020 return, nothing is set in stone. As such, he has steadily fallen while he’s been out - and he’s all the way down to 14 now, falling two spots in the wake of UFC Sao Paulo.</p>
      <p>In terms of relevant results from the event affecting the rankings, well...not much happened. Ronaldo Souza is now ranked at 205 pounds despite coming up short against Jan Blachowicz in the Sao Paulo headliner. Shogun Rua has disappeared from the rankings after a split draw with Paul Craig. And Charles Oliveira didn’t move at lightweight despite a dominant knockout win.</p>
      <p>Here are all the changes from this week.</p>
      <p>P4P - Robert Whittaker is up one to 13. Conor fell two to 14.</p>
      <p>Heavyweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Light Heavyweight - Thiago Santos is the new top contender at 205, with Daniel Cormier falling one spot to two. Nikita Krylov is up one to 14. Jacare Souza enters the LHW rankings for the first time at 15.</p>
      <p>Middleweight - With Jacare out of the 185-pound rankings, a gaggle of fighters moved up one spot. Derek Brunson, Edmen Shahbazyan, Ian Heinisch, Uriah Hall, Brad Tavares, Antonio Carlos Junior, and Omari Akhmedov take over 8 through 14. Anderson Silva re-enters the rankings at 15, despite not winning a fight in almost three years.</p>
      <p>Welterweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Lightweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Featherweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Bantamweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Flyweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Women’s Bantamweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Women’s Flyweight - Andrea Lee falls two spots to nine. Lauren Murphy and Roxy Modafferi moved up one each to seven and eight.</p>
      <p>Women’s Strawweight - No changes.</p>
