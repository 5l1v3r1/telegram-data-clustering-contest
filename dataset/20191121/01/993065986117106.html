      <p>The short film, entitled The Ripple Effect, features members of the Families Bereaved Through Car Crime (FBTCC) group reflecting on their loss, talking about how a death not only devastates immediate family but friends and communities.</p>
      <p>The group hopes the video will deter anyone from becoming involved in car crime.</p>
      <p>The film was launched yesterday at Corpus Christi Youth Centre during Road Safety Week.</p>
      <p>Among those featured in the video is north Belfast father Kevin Fitzpatrick, whose wife Dana (28) and son Kevin Daniel (8) were killed on the Antrim Road by car criminals in a stolen car in December 2000.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the film, Mr Fitzpatrick recalls arriving at the scene to see his wife on the ground.</p>
      <p>"These events on that night will live with me for the rest of my life and these events will continue to haunt my family and Dana's family for the rest of our lives," he said.</p>
      <p>Tommy Holland, a spokesman for FBTCC, said: “We have got lots of feedback from many people who have viewed and shared it, saying how emotional it is and how it makes them feel, but it’s only a small preview, the full film we are launching at our Road Safety Event is just so much more heartbreaking,” he said.</p>
      <p>Belfast lord mayor John Finucane said the "powerful and thought-provoking film underlines the serious dangers associated with car crime and joyriding" and said he would encourage everyone to support the campaign to being an end to car crime.</p>
