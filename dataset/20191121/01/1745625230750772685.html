      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/sommer-ray/">Sommer Ray</a>, who is known for her perfect perky bottom, decided to show off that prime body part by jumping rope. The playful 23-year-old showed up on Instagram in a video on Wednesday in which she bounced her bodacious booty for several seconds before switching to a set of power squats that really gave her gorgeous gams a workout, thanks to the heavy weight she clutched with both hands as she moved up and down.</p>
      <p>Sommer managed to do all this while wearing a couple of pieces from her own athleisure line of clothing called <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5750185/sommer-ray-body-conscious/">Sommer Ray Collection</a>. Her long-sleeved crop top was made of an abstract, black-and-white print evocative of a Jackson Pollock painting, and her gray leggings were made of a stretchy fabric that gave Sommer the freedom to move her body in any direction she chose.</p>
      <p>While working out to Blondie’s “Call Me,” this free spirit made good use of her jump rope and a handy water bottle, both items of which are available in Sommer’s subscription box called Somethings, as noted in her caption.</p>
      <p>To make sure her feet could keep the beat as she went through her paces, she wore hightop sneakers in white and heavy crew socks, also in white. In addition, the Calvin Klein underwear model’s hair was partially up in a long ponytail that whipped around as she moved to the driving beat of Blondie’s number one hit from 1980.</p>
      <p>Throughout the video, the star’s back was to the camera except for when she took a big swig of some sort of liquid out of her signature black water bottle. Afterward, she jokingly growled as if to show how much she needed to be hydrated. Then, she wiped her mouth with her sleeve in a larger-than-life gesture meant to be humorous.</p>

      <p>“Petition to put this in slow mo?” suggested a second hopeful admirer.</p>
      <p>“How are you that good at jump rope,” queried a third follower, who hoped she would respond as this social media user often does when asked a direct question on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“Slayyyyyyyin in the cutest clothes,” said yet another fan, who added a cat emoji, a star emoji, and a yellow heart emoji to Sommer Ray’s spirited post.</p>
