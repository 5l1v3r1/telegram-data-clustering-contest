      <p>POLICE have confirmed they met with Department of Health officials to discuss the neurology recall scandal.</p>
      <p>Around 3,000 patients of consultant Dr Michael Watt were recalled in May last year after safety concerns were raised about his work.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, BBC's Spotlight programme claimed that a procedure known as an epidural blood patch was carried out on many of former patients who didn't require it.</p>
      <p>Last week The Irish News reported that than than 600 patients caught up in the recall were given an unreliable diagnosis or received the wrong drug treatment.</p>

      <p>It also emerged that uncertainty exists around a further 300 cases, who "may" have been given inappropriate care or an incorrect diagnosis.</p>
      <p>The figures are detailed in an 'outcomes' report, which was due to be published by the department in June but was cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances".</p>

      <p>In a statement, the PSNI said: "We are aware of the recall of neurology patients by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust and have met with senior officials within the Department of Health to discuss the issue.</p>
      <p>"The department has agreed to provide us with further information so that we can assess how best to move forward and to enable us to determine if any potential criminal offences can be identified."</p>
      <p>Dr Watt remains suspended from his employer, the Belfast health trust, but applied to retire on medical grounds in August. He remains on full pay.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Last June, The Irish News revealed that the consultant neurologist did not receive an annual appraisal by his medical bosses in the trust for two years prior to a whistleblower raising the alarm.</p>
      <p>Appraisals for his work in 2014, 2015 and 2016 did not take place - but these were instead "completed" in late 2017, five months after he was stopped from seeing his patients.</p>
