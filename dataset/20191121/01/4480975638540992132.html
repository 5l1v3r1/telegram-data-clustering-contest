      <p>Analysts at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) are of the opinion that the European Union (EU) requires a drastic thought process to take benefits of the fiscal stimulus.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes</h3>
      <p>“As the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/ecb">European Central Bank</a> (ECB) stretches the limits of monetary easing, attention is turning to fiscal policy. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">The euro</a> area (EA) has potential fiscal space of 2.0% of GDP.”</p>
      <p>“Potential fiscal space is calculated using a narrow criteria, based purely on the EA budget deficit. It is unlikely to materialise as rules based fiscal policy limits the growth of the public spending path.”</p>
      <p>“Hope of a large-scale fiscal boot for the EA will probably be disappointed. We estimate that an expansion closer to 0.25-0.5% of GDP in 2020 is more likely.”</p>
      <p>“An overhaul of the current rules and a more medium-term focus on policy settings is required.”</p>
      <p>“That will leave an over-onus on the ECB to support reflation. The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> framework needs reviewing, especially in light of the considerable divisions that emerged over the latest easing.”</p>
