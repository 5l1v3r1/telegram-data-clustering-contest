      <p>ELECTORAL rules in Britain which could help regulate contentious banners were never extended to Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The general election campaign in the north has been marred with controversy over loyalist banners targeting Sinn Féin's John Finucane and the SDLP's Claire Hanna.</p>
      <p>In Britain, all printed election material – including material from 'non-party campaigners' – must carry an 'imprint' to show who is responsible for its production.</p>
      <p>The requirement is aimed and helping ensure there is transparency about who is campaigning during an election.</p>
      <p>However, the rules on imprints for general non-party campaigning do not apply in Northern Ireland – meaning that such campaign material can be shrouded in secrecy.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission said: "We have consistently called on the UK Government to extend the imprint rules to Northern Ireland – most recently in our response to the UK government policy consultation: Protecting the Debate."</p>
      <p>A spokesman said the loyalist posters may constitute "non-party campaigning".</p>
      <p>"A non-party campaigner is a group which campaigns in the run-up to elections but is not a political party and does not stand candidates," he said.</p>
      <p>"Campaign material from non-party campaigners will be regulated if it can reasonably be regarded as intended to influence voters to vote for or against political parties or categories of candidates."</p>
      <p>Non-party campaigners in Northern Ireland must register with the commission if they plan to spend more than £10,000 during an election period.</p>
      <p>The imprint rules apply in Britain to all printed election material even if the campaign group isn't required to register due to spending less than the threshold.</p>
