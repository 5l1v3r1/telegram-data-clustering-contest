      <h1>Economic impact of the Grey Cup unclear as forecasts differ</h1>

      <p>A local economist says the numbers don’t add up when it comes to the Canadian Football League’s estimates of an $80-million benefit to Calgary for hosting the Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>University of Calgary professor Trevor Tombe said the anticipated economic effect likely captures the total amount of spending associated with the event but is an “inappropriate” measure of benefit.</p>
      <p>“This really shouldn’t be seen as an economic event. There are lots and lots of things worth doing and enjoying that don’t necessarily contribute to the GDP. It’s not about the dollars and cents, and I think that applies here,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a useful number to know in terms of the scale of the event, but it is not a useful number to think about what the economy would lose if the Grey Cup had not occurred,” which, Tombe said, is “somewhere close to zero.”</p>
      <p>The economist is careful to make Grey Cup-specific assumptions since he hasn’t seen the CFL report that details the projected $80-million benefit but, speaking generally, said this type of event is unlikely to be economically lucrative.</p>
      <p>He said Grey Cup-related spending won’t necessarily be incremental or additional spending for the economy as a whole, considering many Calgarians will simply reallocate their discretionary spending.</p>
      <p>While restaurants and bars near McMahon and the Stampede grounds are likely to take home big earnings, for example, other establishments farther away from the Grey Cup celebrations might see a dip in profits. Calgarians will simply be moving their money to different events, or areas, in the city.</p>
      <p>Even with an influx of visitors from outside of Calgary, which will bring in some new money, it’s unlikely they will generate substantial revenue for the city where increased hotel prices might deter other tourists from visiting Calgary, explained Tombe.</p>
      <p>This, in addition to the money used to produce the Grey Cup celebrations and staffing, culminates in what appears to be a more socially beneficial event rather than economically advantageous, he said.</p>

      <p>Carson Ackroyd, senior vice-president of sales with Tourism Calgary, disagrees with Tombe’s analysis.</p>
      <p>He said Tourism Calgary stands by the CFL in anticipating economic benefit.</p>
      <p>However, their estimate is more conservative. Ackroyd said Tourism Calgary’s initial estimate is about $40 million, with expectations it will climb over $50 million when final numbers are tallied.</p>
      <p>He said the organizations use different methodologies in determining the economic effects, which explains the difference in economic benefit estimates.</p>
      <p>“There’s no disagreement or questioning that this has enormous impact,” said Ackroyd. “This is the biggest event that cities across the country compete to get because of the impact it has on their local market.”</p>
      <p>Sol Zia, executive director of the Calgary Hotel Association, said the Grey Cup is an “appreciated bump” for the industry, which, like many others has felt the economic slump.</p>
      <p>“Our business struggles as a city transcend all categories and all industries,” said Zia. “I think every industry, and certainly the hospitality industry in general, is impacted by the current downturn.”</p>
      <p>He said about three-quarters of their approximately 65 member hotels are close to selling out, with two full up.</p>
      <p>The City of Calgary and Grey Cup organizations estimate about 500,000 participants will come to Calgary from out of town and, along with Calgarians, will bring an estimated $80 million in economic benefit to the city.</p>
      <p>Calgary pitched in $500,000 toward the 107th <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/lets-get-this-party-started-grey-cup-festival-kicks-off-wednesday">Grey Cup Championship festival</a>.</p>
      <p>During last year’s Grey Cup festivities in Edmonton, the organization said the total economic boost was just over $81 million with an overall attendance at Grey Cup events of 430,967 people. The CFL said there were 30,841 visitors from out of town, who spent $29 million during their stay.</p>
      <p>The CFL did not respond to request for comment.</p>
