        <b>The Irish News, Friday November 21 2009: Hughes picks up top Ulster writers’ award</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kevin Hughes probably expected more from 2009 than Tyrone achieved, but the big Red Hand midfielder still came out of the season with many personal accolades and last night’s Ulster GAA Writers’ banquet polished off the action in style for the Killeeshil man.</p>

      <p>Recently he won an Inter-provincial Championship medal and last night, at the UGAAWA annual banquet at the Slieve Russell Hotel, another honour was bestowed upon him.</p>
      <p>Hughes was named Footballer of the Year in front of a packed attendance to follow in the footsteps of former Tyrone winners Peter Canavan, Brian Dooher, the late Cormac McAnallen, Stephen O’Neill and Sean Cavanagh.</p>

        <figcaption>APOLOGETIC BUT FRENCH SAY 'NON' TO REPLAY: France's Thierry Henry (left) celebrates after setting up the winning goal during the FIFA World Cup Qualifying Play-Off against the Republic of Ireland at the Stade de France, Paris, France on Wednesday November 18, 2009. In the wake of the  controversial goal French striker Henry yesterday said the “fairest solution” following his decisive handball incident (see video below) would be to replay the play-off. Henry set up the deciding goal for William Gallas by controlling the ball with his left hand in the 1-1 draw at the Stade de France. The goal in extra-time handed the French a place in next year’s World Cup. But the France Football Federation (FFF) last night rejected calls from Irish striker Robbie Keane and the Football Association of Ireland for Wednesday’s controversial World Cup qualifying play-off to be replayed.
