      <h1>WATCH: Armed Robbers Make Off With $18K After Unleashing Terror In Harare Shop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:27:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:27</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew</a></address>
      <p>A gang of marauding thugs plundered a textile shop in Harare’s CBD in broad daylight on Wednesday. According to reports reaching iHarare, the armed robbers made off with $18 000 ZWL after ransacking a textile shop in Leopold Takawira Street. The incident occurred just before 6 PM.</p>
      <p>Video footage recorded by the shop’s surveillance camera shows three thugs armed with a button stick unleashing terror on shop attendants.  Upon gaining entry into the shop through the entrance, the thugs assault a shop attendant who is behind the counter before turning onto the other attendants who then run to safety. One of the thugs goes behind the counter and starts packing money into a black paper bag.</p>
      <p>The break-in which appears to have been well choreographed happened in a flash, just above a minute.</p>
