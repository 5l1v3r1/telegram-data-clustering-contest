      <h1>AFL donates $300,000 to Lifeline Australia as new partnership with mental health charity begins</h1>

      <h3>The AFL’s renewed commitment to mental health and wellbeing has strengthened, with Lifeline Australia becoming an official charity partner of the league.</h3>
      <p>In announcing the new partnership on Thursday, AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan revealed the league had also donated $300,000 to Lifeline.</p>
      <p>The new relationship between the two organisations comes as mental health awareness continues to grow significantly, particularly in the footy community. The likes of Tom Boyd, Jack Steven, Travis Cloke, Mitch Clark, Matthew Broadbent, Dayne Beams and Alex Fasolo have all taken time away from the game to properly address mental health problems.</p>

      <p>The AFL in August hired Dr Kate Hall and Dr Ranjit Menon to the respective roles of head of mental health and chief psychiatrist.</p>
      <p>“The mental health and wellbeing of everyone involved in our game is a growing focus for us, and we are proud to partner with Lifeline to encourage Australians, especially young Australians, to stay connected and ask for help if they’re struggling,” McLachlan said.</p>
      <p>“Mental health is an issue affecting all workplaces and families. We shouldn’t shy away from it and I encourage anyone who needs support to reach out.</p>

      <p>“We are continuing to work as an industry to ensure we have the best processes and mental healthcare in place for our players, coaches and umpires in our elite competition and there is much work to be done.”</p>
      <p>McLachlan added the league was also working on wellbeing initiatives for players, umpires, administrators and volunteers outside the elite level.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t just essential for our game, it’s essential to enhance the wellbeing of the wider community,” he said.</p>
      <p>Lifeline chief executive Colin Seery said the new partnership, as well as the $300,000 donation, was a “game changer”.</p>
      <p>“The AFL’s decision to take a holistic approach to the integration of mental health initiatives and awareness programs is a positive step in the right direction,” Seery said.</p>
      <p>“The AFL’s decision to truly commit to the outcomes of the partnership by encompassing club, community engagement, education and importantly fundraising across the Lifeline network will make this partnership a game changer.</p>

      <p>“With the AFL’s support we will be able to both increase the number of volunteers we can recruit and train each year and extend Lifeline services, including new channels like text, so that we can answer every call for help.”</p>
      <p>Dr Hall paid tribute to Lifeline’s work and the wide impact it continues to have across the country.</p>
      <p>“Our football communities are impacted by mental health and suicide, and the AFL is part of this critical societal issue. Responding to mental health issues and doing more to prevent the onset of mental health issues in young Australians is everyone’s responsibility,” Dr Hall said.</p>
      <p>“Through our support of Lifeline, we want to reduce the stigma of mental health issues and promote mental health and wellbeing for football communities. The AFL, together with the AFLPA, has a responsibility to transform the management of mental health and wellbeing across the whole industry, and to move towards best practice in mental health prevention and early intervention.”</p>
