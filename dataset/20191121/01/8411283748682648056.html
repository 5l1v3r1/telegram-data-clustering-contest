      <h1>PTI chair sees FOPLP as alternative solution for IC scaling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:58:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:58</time> by <a rel="author">Julian Ho, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>FOPLP (fan-out panel level package) will be a new option that is not meant to support pushes to 7nm, 5nm or even more advanced nodes but rather to provide a packaging solution that can achieve IC scaling without adopting costly advanced fabrication processes, according to DK Tsai, chairman of Taiwan-based backend specialist Powertech Technology (PTI).</p>
      <p>Tsai told Digitimes that in wafer foundry, the more advanced process, the higher performance for chips fabricated. But not every chip designer can afford the high costs for adopting advanced manufacturing nodes. Therefore, FOPLP will become an alternative solution for chipmakers to achieve constant 2D scaling for HPC chipsets without having to use advanced process nodes.</p>
      <p>Tsai continued that fan-out packaging can integrate diverse functional components built using different process nodes to achieve the same performance of SoC fabricated on advanced nodes, thus serving as the most cost-effective solution for IC designers.</p>
      <p>He revealed that PTI has divided its engineers into two major groups, one for packaging and the other for testing, to address the increasingly complicated backend technologies including FOPLP. He said heterogeneous integration packaging for CPUs, WiFi chips, memory chips and other function chips will be more difficult than testing.</p>
      <p>PTI's capex will rise from only NT$10 billion in 2019 to NT$14-15 billion in 2020 before mounting further in 2021-2025 to support development of more advanced backend technologies, according to Tsai.</p>
      <p>He is confident that most memory modules makers - other than those in South Korea - will rely on PTI for backend services in 2020.</p>
