      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 21 — The Australian actress, known for her role in <i>Pitch Perfect</i>, is preparing her first feature, a comedy entitled <i>Seoul Girls</i> in which she intends to play one of the characters, reports <i>Deadline</i>.</p>
      <p>Rebel Wilson is about to embark on a new musical adventure. Having played in the <i>Pitch Perfect</i> trilogy over a pop music score, the Australian actress is taking an interest in the world of K-pop. A project that has struck a chord with American studio Lionsgate, which has acquired the rights.</p>
      <p>Christened <i>Seoul Girls</i>, the comedy will tell of the adventures of a Korean-American high-school student and her friends in their bid to scale the music industry ladder. With help from a former member of a British pop group and a one-time K-pop trainee, their band, the “Seoul Girls” enters an international competition to become the support act for the world’s biggest K-pop group.</p>
      <p>Wilson is fully invested in the picture for not only has she written the script, she will also be producing via her company Camp Sugar in partnership with Monumental Pictures. A rising star in the world of comedy, the actress who played the lead in <i>Isn’t It Romantic</i> will also feature in one of the main roles of <i>Seoul Girls</i>, but it is not yet known which one.</p>
      <p>It is not yet known when shooting will begin or when the film will release in theatres.</p>
      <p>Having stolen the show in numerous comedy movies like <i>Bridesmaids</i> in 2011 or <i>Bachelorette</i> in 2012, the Australian actress scored a major success with the musical trilogy <i>Pitch Perfect</i>. Since then, Wilson has become a Hollywood star and is garnering more and more roles: Notably the main part in the comedy <i>Isn’t It Romantic</i> released by Netflix in February, and in <i>The Hustle</i> with Anne Hathaway, which was released in June.</p>
      <p>The actress was recently seen in Taika Waititi’s black humour comedy, and will feature in the cinema adaptation of the musical comedy <i>Cats</i>, which will be released on December 20. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
