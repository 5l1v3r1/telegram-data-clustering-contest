      <p>Legendary professional wrestling announcer and manager Jim Cornette has resigned from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) following “offensive” remarks he made on Tuesday’s “NWA Powerrr” episode.</p>
      <p>Below is the NWA’s statement on the matter.</p>
      <blockquote>Effective immediately: Jim Cornette has resigned from the National Wrestling Alliance. As an announcer on the November 19th edition of NWA Power, Jim made remarks during a singles match between Nick Aldis and Trevor Murdoch that were both offensive and do not meet the high standards of decency and good faith of the National Wrestling Alliance.<br/>To ensure that such an error can never happen again, we’ve established new procedures of review for all NWA programming going forward.<br/>We sincerely regret our failure in this regard.</blockquote>

      <p>Cornette had made the following remark while on commentary: “Trevor Murdoch is the only person who can strap a bucket of fried chicken to his back and ride a motor scooter across Ethiopia. Trevor Murdoch can take care of himself!”</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, NWA Vice President David Lagana posted this to Twitter: “On tonight’s episode of NWA Powerr airing on November 19th 2019, one of our talents made comments which some viewers found offensive. We deeply regret the error and apologize. We have temporarily taken the program down while we correct this error.”</p>
      <p>The episode has since been re-edited to remove the “fried chicken” line and re-posted to YouTube, Lagana told TheWrap on Wednesday. Only the audio was edited, no video was sacrificed.</p>
      <p>Readers can watch the re-cut episode in its entirety via the video above.</p>

          <figcaption>These days, WWE Superstars don't just make their TV money through in-ring performances on "Raw," "SmackDown Live" and WWE Network pay-per-views -- there's an entire universe of opportunity for popular pro wrestlers to earn big bucks on the small screen. <br/>In our gallery are 11 WWE wrestlers with their own television shows. We've included a few select series from recent years to help paint a picture of the non-canvas landscape. A few: "Straight Up Steve Austin," "Fight Like a Girl" and "The Big Show Show" have yet to premiere. <br/>For the purposes of this story, we only counted the three people who appeared in all 111 episodes of "Total Divas" -- Nikki Bella, Brie Bella and Natalya -- as it being *their* show, but we included the names of everyone who showed up in seven or more episodes of that one.</figcaption>
