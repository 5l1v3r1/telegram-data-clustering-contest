      <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a series of bills that will overhaul the city’s embattled private hauling business by improving safety and truck traffic by reorganizing the business into zones.</p>
      <p>“Here’s what we know — lives were lost, workers were cheated, communities were polluted and ultimately our earth was endangered,” de Blasio said at the signing ceremony for the four new bills in Brooklyn Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Many folks here worked a long time because it was not easy to figure out how to totally break down a broken reality,” de Blasio said, referring to the six-year process that involved Teamsters members who work in the industry and environmental justice activists.</p>
      <p>The reforms come after a string of stories in <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trashed-inside-the-deadly-world-of-private-garbage-collection">ProPublica</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/27/infamous-trash-haulers-with-history-of-fatal-crashes-going-out-of-business/">The Post</a> that exposed the dangerous practices in the industry that’s responsible for disposing of 3 million tons of garbage every year.</p>
      <p>Twenty-eight people were killed in accidents involving private trash trucks since 2010, according to city statistics.</p>
      <p>Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia said the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/city-council-set-to-overhaul-the-private-waste-collection-industry/">bulk of the overhaul</a> comes from dividing the city into 20 zones with up to three private carters selected through a bidding process to serve each zone.</p>
      <p>The current setup often results in multiple carting companies serving a single city block and lengthy routes that require drivers to cut corners, Garcia said.</p>
      <p><b> “</b>This is about ensuring that the public has safer, quieter nights. This is about ensuring that the people who work in the sector are protected and given fair wages,” Garcia said.</p>
      <p>The new plan will result in a 50% reduction in truck traffic, Garcia said. It is scheduled to start in mid-2021, she said.</p>
      <p>Eleven city council members voted against the reforms, fearing that the plan would create a mini-monopoly system that drives smaller carting companies out of business.</p>
