      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Police statistics show the city of Providence is on track to have the fewest shootings in recent record this year.</p>
      <p>The Boston Globe reports shootings in Rhode Island's capital have been going down year-by-year since 2014.</p>
      <p>Providence Police Department data shows that as of Nov. 12 there had been 32 people shot, down from 55 victims in 2018.</p>
      <p>The newspaper states that as of Tuesday, it has been a month since the last person was shot in Providence.</p>
      <p>But even with the decline in shootings, Providence police report no shortage of guns after seizing more than 100 illegal guns as of last week.</p>
      <p>Providence Police Chief Hugh T. Clements Jr. attributes the decrease in gun violence to the force remaining "laser focused on gun crimes."</p>
