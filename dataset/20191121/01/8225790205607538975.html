      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - The company behind a controversial wind farm project says they’ve finished the transport of equipment to the North Shore a week early.</p>
      <p>Convoys transporting wind turbines and other equipment to the project site have been met with nightly protests. Since the convoys began, police have made at least 200 arrests of protesters.</p>
      <p>AES US Generation, the company building the wind farm, had expected to finish the convoys Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“We have completed transport for Na Pua Makani ahead of schedule and will continue to work towards helping Hawaii achieve its 100% renewable energy future,” the company said, in a statement.</p>
      <p>The company said it expects the wind farm to be operational by summer 2020.</p>
      <p>Overnight, <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2019/11/18/more-arrests-made-after-another-large-crowd-wind-farm-protesters-turns-out-kalaeloa/">hundreds of wind farms opponents turned out again at the company’s Kalaeloa equipment yard</a>, and 21 people were arrested for disobeying a police officer.</p>
      <p>Critics of the project are concerned about potential health effects and the killing of native Hawaiian wildlife such as the Hawaiian hoary bat.</p>
