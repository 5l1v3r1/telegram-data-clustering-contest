      <p>THE Department for Economy has officially launched the first Northern Ireland apprenticeship week, which will take place from February 3 to 7 2020.</p>
      <p>The new initiative will feature a dedicated week of events and promotional activity to demonstrate how apprenticeships work for individuals, businesses, communities and the wider economy.</p>
      <p>The department’s deputy secretary, Heather Cousins, said it will seek to bring together councils, employers, colleges, universities and private training providers to raise the profile of apprenticeships.</p>
      <p>“The Northern Ireland apprenticeship week 2020 events map is now available with over 25 apprenticeship events already confirmed to take place during the week and events being added all the time.</p>
      <p>“We would like all apprenticeship partners to get involved by hosting their own apprenticeship events or in collaboration with others.”</p>
