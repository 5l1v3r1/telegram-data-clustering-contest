      <h1>UFC Fight Night: Korean Zombie vs. Ortega fight card</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mookie Alexander</a></address>
      <p>Due to ESPN’s commitment to airing the college football playoffs, there is no New Year’s Eve show for the UFC this year. This is why UFC 245 is on December 14th, and why the final show of 2019 will be on December 21st in South Korea.</p>
      <p>In the main event, former title challengers Chan Sung Jung (aka “The Korean Zombie”) and Brian Ortega will square off in a key featherweight matchup that should close out the year with a bang. The co-main event is a really good light heavyweight scrap between Volkan Oezdemir and rising star Aleksandar Rakic. Lest we forget the return of “The Korean Superboy” Doo Ho Choi, who’s back in action against Charles Jourdain. Keep an eye on a flyweight battle between Matt Schnell and Alexandre Pantoja, as that one has high potential to be a thriller.</p>
      <p>There’s no set bout order yet, but we do know that UFC Busan’s main card is exclusive to ESPN+ at 5 AM ET, while prelims start at 2 AM ET on ESPN television.</p>
      <p>Here’s what is on tap for the UFC’s 2019 finale:</p>
      <p>Chan Sung Jung vs. Brian Ortega<br/>Volkan Oezdemir vs. Aleksandar Rakic<br/>Doo Ho Choi vs. Charles Jourdain<br/>Da Un Jung vs. Mike Rodriguez<br/>Jun Yong Park vs. Marc-Andre Barriault<br/>Raoni Barcelos vs. Said Nurmagomedov<br/>Cyril Gane vs. Tanner Boser<br/>Seung Woo Choi vs. Suman Mokhtarian<br/>Dong Hyun Ma vs. Omar Antonio Morales Ferrer<br/>Alexandre Pantoja vs. Matt Schnell<br/>Kyung Ho Kang vs. Ling Pingyuan<br/>Alateng Heili vs. Ryan Benoit<br/>TBD vs. Sabina Mazo<br/>TBD vs. Amanda Lemos</p>
