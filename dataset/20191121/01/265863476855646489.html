      <h1>Wendy Williams Tells Vicki Gunvalson To Just Leave RHOC After The OG Lost Her Full-Time Status</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:58:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:58</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>In the fourteenth season of the Real Housewives of Orange County, Vicki Gunvalson was demoted from a full-time member of the cast to what is known as a ‘Friend of the Housewives’ and it sounds like Wendy Williams has an opinion on this! The talk show host discussed Vicki’s situation on her latest Hot Topics segment and she made it clear that the other woman would be better off RHOC entirely!</p>
      <p>Of course, Wendy explained why Vicki actually deserves to continue being a full-time star on the Bravo show and that she was ‘punked’ when they demoted her.</p>
      <p>In this situation, however, she believes the other woman should just exit RHOC!</p>
      <p>‘Vic, you know that I love you, but you used to hold an orange, now you are a friend of the show. At that point, you, the OG of all franchises, you started this, the queen — I am shocked that you would let them demote you. [If it was me] I would quit, like, ‘Hell no! I am the president of this company now and you are giving me a cubicle and telling me I am a salesperson? I am out!’ Wendy told her studio audience.</p>
      <p>Williams’ words come after Vicki hinted she may not be back in season 15 while at BravoCon.</p>
      <p>Vicki mentioned that the cast list for next season is really unsure but stressed that she won’t come back as a ‘friend.’</p>
      <p>‘So, when you say you won’t let them demote you again, the only demotion is for them to fire you, there’s nothing lower than being a ‘friend’ of the show. I understand her passion and I understand her being pissed off,’ Wendy concluded.</p>
