      <p>A unicorn. A real snowflake. A baby brother.</p>
      <p>Just some of the requests to Santa from children who drop their letter in to the jolly fellow's mailbox outside Clarence Town Post Office.</p>
      <p>Children in the town have been getting a response to their letter from Santa's mailbox for as long as post office licensee Helena Morris - who has been there for more than 30 years - can remember.</p>
      <p>The Lions Club were instrumental in the tradition for many years, as were other community members including Col Medcalf until Di Tanner-Bennett heard the call of the jingle bells and took up her new role as Santa's Secretary in 2017.</p>
      <p>This year Di decided the regular Australia Post supplied letterbox needed a little Christmas revamp.</p>
      <p>"I put a post on Facebook asking if anyone had an old letterbox they could give me and within a half an hour a lady had contacted me to say she had a brand new one we could have," she said.</p>
      <p>"I took it around to (spray painter) Greg Sanders and asked if he happened to be painting anything red anytime soon and he said just leave it on the verandah."</p>
      <p>Mr Sanders delivered the shiny red mailbox to Di and, being a former sign writer, she gave is some Christmas magic.</p>
      <p>There's no missing the special red letterbox next to the official Australia Post box - it is decorated with snowflakes and reindeer and clearly marked "North Pole Mail".</p>
      <p>The first year Di was contracted to work for Santa she had 38 letters to respond to. Last year there was more than 100 from not just Clarence Town children but from Medowie, Sydney and even Queensland.</p>
      <p>The children receive a full page, personalised letter back, thanks to the Christmas spirit that's overflowing from great grandmother Di.</p>
      <p>"It's a bit of fun,'" she said with a twinkle in her eye before admitting her real thoughts:</p>
      <p>"I think it's really special."</p>
      <p>So special that Di goes to great lengths to ensure the magic of Santa is kept alive. Clarence Town is a small, close-knit community and Di is one of its backbone members. Her involvement in such a wide range of community organisations and events means Santa's letters often contain some fun family information not mentioned in the child's original letter.</p>
      <p>"I really get stuck into it," she laughed.</p>
      <p>"Some of the stuff the kids ask for is hilarious.</p>
      <p>"We had a five-year-old ask for a pig dog and a real four wheel drive, one little girl wanted a real snowflake and another little girl wanted a unicorn."</p>
      <p>(For the record, Santa had to tell the little girl a real unicorn wouldn't fit in his sleigh and explain that once a snowflake had left the North Pole it would melt in Australia.)</p>
      <p>This year she has already had to put out a Facebook post to ask for help in identifying one little letter writer who had requested a stable - and the horse to go in it.</p>
      <p>Each child's personalised response from Santa is mailed back to them - so parents must remember to put their child's full name and address on the letter.</p>
      <p>Mrs Morris said the annual event is a special tradition in Clarence Town.</p>
      <p>"Di does such a wonderful job," she said.</p>
      <p>"She is such a giving person, she just loves the town and loves the area.</p>
      <p>"This type of thing really restores people's faith."</p>
