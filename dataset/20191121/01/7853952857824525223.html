      <p>The Trump administration on Wednesday gave Huawei its second reprieve this week, allowing some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant after it was placed on a trade blacklist over national security concerns six months ago, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department was quoted as saying in a statement that it has begun issuing licenses for some companies to sell goods to Huawei. </p>
      <p>“The Department is issuing these narrow licenses to authorize limited and specific activities which do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>A source told Reuters that of roughly 300 license requests, about half have been processed with roughly half of those – or one quarter – getting approved and another quarter getting denied.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to the world’s top telecommunications equipment maker.</p>
      <p>Huawei Technologies, also the second largest smartphone maker, has been anxiously awaiting a license for Google to supply its mobile services to new models, the report noted. </p>
      <p>According to a second Reuters source, some licenses for sales of cell phone components and non-electronic components were approved.</p>
      <p>Companies began receiving notices of approval and “intent to deny” notices from the Commerce Department on Wednesday, according to the report.</p>
      <p>US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network late on Tuesday that the department has “had 290-something requests for specific licenses. We now have been starting to send out the 20-day intent to deny letters and some approvals.”</p>
      <p>The move came after the Commerce Department renewed the so-called temporary general license for Huawei for a third time on Monday, extending permission for Huawei to engage in limited transactions to assist US rural network operators, Reuters noted.</p>
      <p>The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, welcomed the Commerce Department’s announcement, saying sales of the non-sensitive products help ensure the competitiveness of US chipmakers, “which is essential to national security.”</p>
      <p>“We hope license approvals continue to proceed in an appropriate and timely manner,” the group added.</p>
