      <h1>‘Bella Ciao’: Why a World War II anti-Fascist anthem is ringing across Europe again</h1>
      <h2>'Bella Ciao' is being sung at rallies in Italy, and was heard during the anti-Brexit protests in the UK, the pro-independence demonstrations by Catalan activists in Spain, and the Yellow Vests movement in France.</h2>

      <p>On Monday, more than 7,000 people gathered in the Italian city of Modena to protest against Matteo Salvini, the far-right leader who served as the country’s Deputy Prime Minister until September.</p>
      <p>This was the second large protest in two weeks organised by the grassroots movement called the “Sardines”, which held a rally in Bologna last Thursday that drew over 12,000 people.</p>

      <p>In both these protests, the attendees were heard reciting the song “Bella Ciao”, a melody from World War II written by anti-fascists who were opposing dictator Benito Mussolini.</p>
      <p>What is the Sardine movement, and what is the significance of the tune “Bella Ciao”?</p>
      <h3>The Sardine movement</h3>
      <p>Salvini is currently campaigning in Emilia-Romagna, an industrial region in northern Italy that has traditionally been a leftwing bastion.</p>
      <p>It is currently ruled by the centre-left Democratic Party, and goes to polls in January next year.</p>
      <p>Salvini’s far-right League party, which according to various polls enjoys considerable popularity throughout Italy, has vowed to defeat the Left in Emilia-Romagna.</p>
      <p>A protest against Salvini’s party drew an estimated 12,000-15,000 people in Bologna last week.</p>
      <p>During the protests in Bologna’s main square, the group squeezed together in the rain “like sardines”, giving the movement its name.</p>
      <p>The subsequent rally in Modena on Monday was also successful, drawing 7,000, and more have been planned in Milan, Palermo, and Florence.</p>
      <p>The Emilia-Romagna poll is important for Salvini, as success here would mean that he could force national leaders to call for an early general election, which could bring his League party to the power given the wave of support it is currently enjoying.</p>

      <h3>The song “Bella Ciao”</h3>
      <p>“Bella Ciao” was sung at both of the Sardines’ rallies, and has been a favourite among anti-fascist protesters across Europe in recent months and years.</p>
      <p>The song has been heard during the anti-Brexit protests in the UK, the pro-independence demonstrations by Catalan activists in Spain, and the Yellow Vests movement in France.</p>
      <p>The song has also been popularised by the 2017 Netflix crime drama series ‘Money Heist’, which ran it as part of its soundtrack.</p>
      <p>The anthem’s origin can be traced to the Second World War when the anti-fascist Partisan movement was fighting against the Republic of Salò, a puppet state of Nazi Germany in northern Italy.</p>
      <p>Many anthems became popular during this period, including the Russian folk song “Katyusha”, and the Italian songs “Fischia il vento” and “Bella Ciao”.</p>
      <p>“Bella Ciao”, meaning “Beautiful Goodbye”, talks about the possibility of dying in the mountains (the Italian Alps). “Una mattina mi son svegliato, e ho trovato l’invasor,” goes a line, meaning “One morning I awakened, and I found the invader.”</p>
      <p>According to an article in the Spanish paper El País, the song is believed to have originated in the Po Valley, where rice gatherers sang it to lament the loss of their youth in the hard work of the field.</p>
      <p>The lyrics are said to represent the idealism of the Italians fighting Mussolini and the Third Reich.</p>
      <p>The complete lyrics in English:</p>
      <p>
        <i>One morning I awakened,</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao! (Goodbye beautiful)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>One morning I awakened</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And I found the invader.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Oh partisan carry me away,</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>oh partisan carry me away</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Because I feel death approaching.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And if I die as a partisan,</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>and if I die as a partisan</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>then you must bury me.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Bury me up in the mountain,</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>bury me up in the mountain</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>under the shade of a beautiful flower.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And all those who shall pass,</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>and all those who shall pass</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>will tell me “what a beautiful flower.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>This is the flower of the partisan,</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>this is the flower of the partisan</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>who died for freedom.</i>
      </p>
