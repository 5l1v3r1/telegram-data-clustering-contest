      <h4>The competition is getting tougher and tougher on ‘The Masked Singer.’ The Nov. 20 episode featured two epic face-offs. The episode concluded with the jaw-dropping reveal of the Flower.</h4>
      <p>The Nov. 20 episode of<a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/the-masked-singer"><i> The Masked Singer</i></a> is featuring two major face-offs of masked singers. The Flamingo vs. Leopard face-off kicks off the night. The Flamingo is up first. Her clue video features images of the Eiffel Tower and Taj Mahal, as well as a mariachi band. She also says that this experience is teaching her to love her own voice for the first time in a long time. The Flamingo performs a powerful rendition of “Lady Marmalade” by <b>Patti LaBelle</b>. Afterward, the Flamingo cries and admits how much <i>The Masked Singer</i> has built her confidence. The guesses for the Flamingo include <b>Adrienne Bailon</b>, <b>Bella Thorne</b>, <b>Jillian Michaels</b>, and <b>Fantasia Barrino</b>.</p>
      <p>The Leopard reveals that he set himself “free for the first time” when he was a teenager. Since then, he’s treated the world as his catwalk. He mentions New York and Paris in his clue video. The Leopard performs <b>Earth, Wind &amp; Fire’s</b> “September.” <b>Ken Jeong</b> guesses <b>Donald Glover</b>. <b>Nicole Scherzinger</b> notes the Leopard brought up “glamazon” and “champion” in his clue package, which makes her think <b>RuPaul</b> may be under the costume. However, she thinks the Leopard could be <b>Seal</b> and <b>Robin Thicke</b> agrees. The winner of the face-off is the Flamingo!</p>
      <p>The Flower vs. Rotterweiler face-off is up next. The Flower admits in her clue video that she’s “always changing.” She puts emphasis on a perfume bottle and disco ball as well. She adds that she goes on and on “like a rolling stone.” The Flower performs “Alone” by <b>Heart</b> and later reveals that she’s performed “all around the world.”<b> Jenny McCarthy</b> and Robin believe the Flower is <b>Patti LaBelle</b>. Guest panelist <b>Joel McHale</b> guesses <b>Barbra Streisand</b>.</p>
      <p>The Rottweiler fears the panelists will judge him once they find out his identity. So he’s trying to <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/13/kelly-osbourne-ladybug-the-masked-singer-season-2-episode-6-recap/">stay masked</a> for as long as possible. He shows off a platinum grill in his clue video and multiple awards. He performs an epic rendition of “Grenade” by <b>Bruno Mars</b>. Jenny thinks the Rottweiler could be <b>Gavin Rossdale</b>, while Ken is convinced this is<b> Billie Joe Armstrong</b>. Robin still believes the Rottweiler is<b> Darren Criss</b>.</p>
      <p>The face-off winner is the Rottweiler. This means the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/09/25/the-masked-singer-season-2-costumes-celebrity-contestants-photos/">Flower and the Leopard</a> go head-to-head in a smackdown. At the end of the day, the Leopard wins. That means the Flower is going home! The Flower is revealed as Patti LaBelle.</p>
