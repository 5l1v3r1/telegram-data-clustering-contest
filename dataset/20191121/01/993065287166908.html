      <h1>DUP silent after councillor accused of retweeting support for banners targeting Sinn Féin's John Finucane</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Brendan Hughes</a></address>
      <p>THE DUP has remained silent about a councillor whose Twitter account disappeared after he allegedly shared a message supporting controversial banners targeting Sinn Féin's John Finucane.</p>
      <p>The online profile for Mid and East Antrim councillor Marc Collins was removed from the social media platform in recent days.</p>
      <p>Images have been circulated online appearing to show the councillor had retweeted a message about a banner targeting Mr Finucane, Sinn Féin's Westminster election candidate for North Belfast.</p>
      <p>The tweet included pictures of a banner off west Belfast's Shankill Road which attacks Mr Finucane and his family, including his father Pat Finucane who was murdered by loyalists in 1989.</p>
      <p>An accompanying message reads: "Well done to the Shankill loyalists who erected the banner today. It has SF foaming at their collective mouths."</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin leader Mary-Lou McDonald has condemned a "sinister and dangerous campaign of threats and intimidation" against the Finucanes.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds insisted the banners have "nothing to do with our campaign" and "anything that is personally abusive or offensive, inaccurate and smearing of any candidate in any political party is to be condemned".</p>
      <p>However, he and party leader Arlene Foster also challenged Sinn Féin to condemn IRA violence during the Troubles.</p>
      <p>Mr Collins did not respond yesterday to requests for a comment.</p>
      <p>The DUP was asked whether any action would be taken against Mr Collins given the party's stance against the contentious banners.</p>
      <p>The party did not respond to requests for a comment.</p>
      <p>It is not the first time questions have been raised over Mr Collins's social media activity.</p>
      <p>In May, he issued an apology over racist and sectarian remarks he had made in old Facebook posts.</p>
      <p>At the time Mr Collins said most of the comments were made when he was aged 16 and he was "embarrassed" by them.</p>
