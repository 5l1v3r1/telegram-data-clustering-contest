      <p>REUTERS: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc on Wednesday received an early U.S. approval for its gene silencing drug to treat patients with a rare genetic disorder that can cause severe pain.</p>
      <p>The drug, Givlaari, uses a mechanism known as RNA interference to target and "silence" specific genetic material, blocking the production of the protein that causes the disease called acute hepatic porphyria.</p>

      <p>The buildup of the protein can cause acute seizures that occur suddenly and can produce permanent neurological damage and death, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
      <p>Alnylam did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for pricing details. Shares of the company were up 7.5per cent before trading was halted ahead of the announcement.</p>
      <p>"Givlaari will be an entirely new therapy for a poorly treated rare disease patient population," said Oppenheimer analyst Leland Gershell, adding he expected peak sales of US$560 million. (http://bit.ly/37oqz9Z)</p>
      <p>The FDA was due to decide on the drug by Feb. 4.</p>
      <p>The Massachusetts-based drugmaker already has another treatment, Onpattro, on the market to treat polyneuropathy in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, a potentially fatal condition that affects an estimated 50,000 people worldwide.</p>
