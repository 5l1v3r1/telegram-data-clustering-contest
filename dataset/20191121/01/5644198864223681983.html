      <p>REUTERS: World number one Brooks Koepka pulled out of the U.S. Presidents Cup team due to a knee injury on Wednesday and was replaced with Rickie Fowler by playing captain Tiger Woods.</p>
      <p>"Today, I am announcing my withdrawal from the U.S. Presidents Cup team because of my knee injury," Koepka said in a statement on the Presidents Cup website. "I notified captain Tiger Woods that despite constant medical care and rehab, I am not able to play golf at this time.</p>

      <p>"I consider it to be a high honour to be part of the 2019 team and I regret not being able to compete."</p>
      <p>Koepka has played a limited amount of golf since the Tour Championships and not at all since the CJ Cup in South Korea in late October.</p>
      <p>He had been in a race for fitness for the Dec. 9-15 Presidents Cup, which will pit the U.S. against an International Team at Australia's Royal Melbourne Golf Club.</p>
      <p>"Brooks and I talked, and he’s disappointed that he won’t be able to compete,” said Woods. "I told him to get well soon and that we’re sorry he won’t be with us in Australia.</p>
      <p>"He would clearly be an asset both on the course and in the team room.”</p>
      <p>While Fowler was not one of Woods's original captain's picks he brings plenty of experience to what will be his third Presidents Cup. He has a record of 4-3-1 in his two previous appearances.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to Rickie and he has agreed to join the U.S. Team,” Woods said. “Rickie has played on a couple Presidents Cup teams, was someone seriously considered for a pick and is well respected and liked by his team mates.</p>
      <p>"I know he’s going to do a great job for us.</p>
      <p>"We’re ready to go.”</p>
