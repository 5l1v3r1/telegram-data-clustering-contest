      <h1>How business groups dominate our politicians</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:40:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/author/leith/" target="_blank">Unconventional Economist</a></address>
      <p>The Grattan Institute has <a href="https://blog.grattan.edu.au/2019/11/who-contributes-to-policy-reviews/">released analysis</a> on which groups hold the most influence over Australian policy making. And not surprisingly, the business lobby dominates:</p>
      <blockquote>As Figure 2 shows, the financial and professional services industries together represented 57 per cent of the 400 submissions to the Tax White Paper from organisations, despite collectively representing only 18 per cent of the economy. These types of businesses tend to be most familiar with the tax system â€“ after all, tax advice is a big part of what they do. But the flip side is that they also have a larger vested interest than most.</blockquote>
