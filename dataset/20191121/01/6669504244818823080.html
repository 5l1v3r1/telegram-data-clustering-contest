      <p>An interfaith gathering representing religions from all over the globe is meeting in Vernon to spread its message of kindness and kinship in an evening of philosophical thought.</p>
      <p>The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at, Vernon, is holding the Absolute Justice Kindness a Kinship conference Nov. 25, bringing together religious representatives from half a dozen of the world's religions in an effort to promote “harmonious co-existence among members of Canada's cultural mosaic.”</p>
      <p>According to an Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at press release, the event is being held “in light of the new and grave dangers becoming manifest in the world.” The event hopes to inspire confidence in Canadians and discuss practical and sustainable paths that can lead to world peace.</p>
      <p>The free conference will feature Okanagan Indian Band Chief Byron Louis speaking from an aboriginal perspective along with Okanagan Sikh Temple priest Giani Gurpreet Singh talking from the perspective of Sikhism.</p>
      <p>Four talks will come from various Christian representatives, addressing everything from the metaphysical perspective of Christianity to the Catholic Church. Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and the Baha'i faith will also have representatives speaking from the perspective of their individual faiths.</p>
      <p>The event is being organized by the Vernon chapter of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at, the world's largest Islamic organization founded in 1889. The group's motto is “love for all, hatred for none.”</p>
      <p>The event takes place at the Greater Vernon Recreation Centre on Monday, Nov. 25, from 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. The event is free and includes dinner.</p>
