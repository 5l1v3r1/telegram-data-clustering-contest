      <p>LOYALIST blogger Jamie Bryson has denied being behind a series of controversial banners targeting Sinn Féin election candidate John Finucane and his family.</p>
      <p>Mr Bryson defended the displays and criticised "Sinn Féin who talk about 'sinister banners'" while they "continue glorify the IRA".</p>
      <p>Several loyalist banners <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/18/news/anti-john-finucane-banners-a-hate-crime-sinn-fe-in-says-1767935/">have been erected against Mr Finucane</a>, while another banner <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/15/news/anti-claire-hanna-banner-put-up-in-south-belfast-1766013/">targets the SDLP's Claire Hanna</a>.</p>
      <p>Police are examining whether the displays against the Westminster election candidates could constitute a criminal offence such as a "hate incident or hate crime".</p>

      <p>One which targeted Mr Finucane was removed by Belfast council under police guard on Monday from a council playpark in the loyalist Tigers Bay area.</p>

      <p>Mr Bryson was asked on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show yesterday whether he was involved in the erection of the banners or discussions around organising them.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"I have many discussions with many people all the time, you know, politicians, community activists, unionists, loyalists – I talk to many people on a daily basis. I'm not going to get into private conversations I've had with people," he said.</p>
      <p>"But I'm telling you I did not organise and I did not put up the banners."</p>
      <p>He added: "I am not behind the banners. I am not orchestrating this as some people may like to say, and the notion that I would be orchestrating this in all of these geographical locations is absolutely ridiculous, that one person would be behind all of this.</p>
      <p>"It's just an effort to create one particular bogeyman. It's an absolute nonsense."</p>

      <p>Defending the banners, Mr Bryson said Sinn Féin are "trying to ride two horses" and "can't have it both ways".</p>
      <p>"This is Sinn Féin who talk about 'sinister banners'. This is the same Sinn Féin that continue glorify the IRA," he said.</p>
      <p>The banners, which include offensive and false allegations, come amid tensions over two constituencies which are expected to be closely fought in the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>Mr Finucane is hoping to take the North Belfast seat from DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, while Ms Hanna is vying to unseat the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly in South Belfast.</p>
      <p>One banner off west Belfast's Shankill Road attacks Mr Finucane and his family, including his father Pat Finucane who was murdered by loyalists in 1989.</p>
      <p>In south Belfast, a banner against Ms Hanna asks if Shankill bomber Sean Kelly would be campaigning for the Westminster candidate – a suggestion dismissed by the SDLP.</p>
      <p>It follows Sinn Féin standing aside in some constituencies including South Belfast in order to back other anti-Brexit candidates. The SDLP is likewise not running in North Belfast.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin leader Mary-Lou McDonald condemned the "sinister and dangerous campaign of threats and intimidation" against the Finucanes, while Mr Eastwood said the banners were "seeking to sow hatred and division".</p>
