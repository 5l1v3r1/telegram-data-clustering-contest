      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/draya-michele/">Draya Michele</a> recently attended the American Influencer Awards and decided to show off her look on her Instagram page.</p>
      <p>The reality star posted a photo for her 7.7 million followers to see on Tuesday, November 19. In the photo, Draya is standing on the pink carpet at the awards ceremony, which was held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California. In the photo Draya shared, her fans were able to see the influencer’s stunning dress from Oh Polly. The spaghetti-strapped dress shows off Draya’s cleavage as she is seen standing straight and looking at the camera. The dress also has two puffy sleeves that stop in the middle of her arms. The dress is cut short, stopping at the top half of Draya’s thighs.</p>
      <p>To complement Draya’s simple yet sexy look, she also decided to style her hair and makeup in a minimal way. The <i>Basketball Wives</i> alum styled her dark hair in a bun, which was placed behind her head. Her face is visible in the photo, as it is styled in a center part in the photo. For her makeup, Draya is rocking foundation, winged eyeliner, and highlighter on her face. She is also wearing a brown matte lipstick, which seems to be finished off with a lip gloss. Her eyebrows are also lightly filled in for the Instagram snapshot.</p>
      <p>As far as accessories, Draya opted not to go to extremes on the night of the awards show. She is seen in the photo wearing silver hoops with white decorative balls throughout them. She isn’t wearing any other accessories in the photo, but the nude nail polish on her acrylic nails is also on full display.</p>
