      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/kylie-jenner/">Kylie Jenner’s</a> bestie, Heather Sanders, recently posted a photo on her personal Instagram page.</p>
      <p>The YouTuber and Instagram influencer looked absolutely stunning in her latest selfie, which she shared with her 1.5 million Instagram followers. In the photo, Sanders is seen looking intensely at the camera as she is rocking a glamorous look. She is wearing a sparkly black top in the photo, which shows off her cleavage to her Instagram followers. The top has thin straps on both sides of her shoulders and reveals her glowing skin.</p>
      <p>Sanders decided to add even more glam to her look with her hair and makeup. In the photo, her hair is styled in a sleek, half-up, half-down hairdo. The top half of her hair is completely pulled away from her face, allowing her fans to see her makeup. In the post, Sanders tagged Styles by Synphony as her hairstylist.</p>
      <p>As for makeup, Sanders went with a dark theme to match her top. The influencer is seen looking intensely at the camera while wearing a makeup look that was created by celebrity artist Alexander Echeverri. Sanders is wearing a smoky eye makeup look that consists of dark eyeshadow, black eyeliner on her top lid, dramatic faux eyelashes, foundation, blush, and highlighter. To finish off the look, Sanders is seen wearing a brown lip gloss. She has also had her eyebrows done, and credited Los Angeles eyebrow stylist Giselle Soto for the look.</p>
      <p>For her accessories, Sanders opted to keep it simple. The influencer decided to wear a silver choker, which fit loosely around her neck. Sanders also decided to add diamond-studded earrings to finish off the sexy look.</p>
