      <h1>It Would Cost RM2970 To Replace The Samsung Galaxy Fold Screens</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:00:58+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/heirul/" target="_blank">Heirul Kamel</a></address>
      <p>At long last, the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/195642/samsung-galaxy-fold-malaysia-price-preorder/">Samsung Galaxy Fold</a> was finally released in Malaysia back in October. Seeing that the Galaxy Fold retails at RM8399, one major question remains: what happens if its screens were to get damaged?</p>
      <p>The obvious answer is that you’ll have to send it to a Samsung authorised service center. Provided that the damage was caused by a flaw and not inflicted by yourself, you’ll walk away with a peace of mind as long as the Galaxy Fold’s warranty is still valid. But what if you damaged the screen by accident or require repairs after the warranty has expired? Needless to say, you’ll need to prepare a lot of money if you still want to watch Netflix on your Samsung Galaxy Fold’s large display.</p>

      <p>According to Samsung Malaysia’s support page which was updated recently, it will cost you RM2540 to replace the Fold’s inner screen, while its exterior screen will run you for RM430. Which means that you’ll need a total of RM2970 if both of its displays require repairs.</p>
      <p>So are all foldable phones expensive to repair? According to recent findings from Chinese tech website IT Home, that pretty much seems to be the case for the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/197300/huawei-mate-x-gets-official-launch-date-china-to-receive-phone-first/">Huawei Mate X</a> which was recently launched in China. The website reported that Huawei has released the price list for off-warranty Mate X repairs and revealed that it would cost a staggering CNY7080 (~RM4180) for a screen replacement, which is incredibly higher than the repairs for the Samsung Galaxy Fold.</p>

      <p>So it goes without saying that if you are planning to pick up a foldable phone in the future – be it the Samsung Galaxy Fold, Huawei Mate X, the newly launched Motorola Razr, or even the upcoming ones from <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/176971/xiaomi-foldable-smartphone-is-real/">Xiaomi</a> and <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/178987/oppo-foldable-phone-teased-on-weibo/">OPPO</a> – take great care of them by using them responsibly and storing them safely. Else, better buck up if they ever get damaged.</p>
