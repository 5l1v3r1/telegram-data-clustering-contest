      <p>A shallow magnitude 6.1 earthquake hit northwestern <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/laos.html">Laos</a> near the Thai border early on Thursday, the United States Geological Survey reported. </p>
      <p>There were no immediate reports of damage after the earthquake hit at 6:50am local time (23:50 GMT on Wednesday).<br/><br/>But shaking could be felt more than 700 kilometres (435 miles) away in the Thai capital Bangkok.<br/><br/>"The shaking ... was the main shock from a quake in Laos at 6:50am and was felt in northern and northeastern <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/thailand.html">Thailand</a> and Bangkok and suburbs," said Sophon Chaila, an official at the Thai Meteorological Department.<br/><br/>"As of now there is no report of damage," Sophon added. <br/><br/>Residents in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi also felt buildings sway. <br/><br/>"The ceiling lights were shaking quite strongly. I felt dizzy and scared," said Hanoi resident Tran Hoa Phuong, who felt the earthquake in her 27-storey apartment building. <br/><br/>It hit about three hours after a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the same region of Laos, near the site of the controversial Xayaburi dam project. <br/><br/>Information is slow to trickle out of the closed communist state, and there were no reports of damage or injuries after the twin quakes hit.</p>
