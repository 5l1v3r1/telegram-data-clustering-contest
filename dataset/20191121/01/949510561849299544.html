      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Utah woman charged with a crime after her stepchildren saw her topless in her own home is fighting the case, citing a court ruling that overturned a topless ban in Colorado.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for Tilli Buchanan say the law is unfair because it treats men and women differently for baring their chests.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors argue that nudity is commonly understood to include women’s breasts.</p>
      <p>A judge heard the misdemeanor lewdness case Tuesday and is expected to rule in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Buchanan says she and her husband had removed their shirts to keep their clothes from getting dusty while working in their garage.</p>
      <p>If convicted, Buchanan could be required to register as a sex offender for 10 years.</p>
      <p>A global campaign has seen mixed success fighting similar ordinances in other parts of the country.</p>
