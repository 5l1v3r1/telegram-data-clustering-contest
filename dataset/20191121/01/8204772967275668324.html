      <p>Sir, – I am not sure why Verona Murphy thinks that the drink-driving laws have decimated rural life (<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/taoiseach-stands-by-verona-murphy-despite-further-controversial-remarks-1.4088124">Home News, November 20th</a>).</p>
      <p>  I live in Co Wexford, Verona’s part of Ireland. At night, I can see that most of the rural pubs in these parts appear to have a lot of designated drivers parked outside.</p>
      <p>It does me good to see such an open display of civic responsibility. – Yours, etc,</p>
