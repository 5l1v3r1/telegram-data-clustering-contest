      <p>If the idea of getting your hands on one of the latest iPhone models basically for free sounds enticing to you, then you’ll definitely want to be aware of a T-Mobile promotion that gets underway on Friday.</p>
      <p>As part of the Un-carrier’s <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/2019-magenta-friday">“Magenta Friday” promotion</a> that launches on November 22, a full week before Black Friday, T-Mobile customers have the chance to snag as many as four iPhone 11 or iPhone XR handsets — basically for free, it’s just that you’d have to pay only the sales tax for the model(s) over a span of 24 months.</p>
      <p>Here are the key details of the promotion:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Starting this Friday, if you’re a new or existing T-Mobile customer you can get one of those iPhones we mentioned above OR up to $700 off an iPhone XS, XS Max, 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max with bill credits when you activate a new voice line on a qualifying rate plan and trade in a qualifying iPhone.</li>
        <li>With T-Mobile’s <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/essentials">Essentials</a> plan, you can get four lines of unlimited talk, text and high-speed data for $30 per month per line with AutoPay. This means customers can get four lines for $30 per month per line (plus taxes and fees), as well as up to four iPhone 11 models for free.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On a related note, T-Mobile customers can also score an iPhone 8 for free or take up to $450 off an iPhone 8 Plus with monthly bill credits when they activate a new voice line on a qualifying rate plan and trade in a qualifying iPhone. Likewise, there’s a similar Apple Watch promotion going on, whereby T-Mobile customers can get one Apple Watch Series 3 or 5 and take $200 off a second one with monthly bill credits when they join T-Mobile and activate both watches OR add a watch line on an existing qualifying plan.</p>
      <p>As noted, these offers kick off on November 22, and more details about them can be <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/deals-hub">found here</a>.</p>
