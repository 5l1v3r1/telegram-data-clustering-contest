      <p><a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/squarepusher/">Squarepusher</a>, real name Tom Jenkinson, has announced his new album <i>Be Up A Hello.</i> The first since 2015’s <i>Damogen Furies</i>, Squarepusher returns to the moniker after spending the past few years working on various different projects.</p>
      <p>According to a press release, the album will features moody tracks, floor fillers and breakbeat records. On this album, he used an array of vintage analogue and digital hardware, similar to what he used to make his music in the 1990s. These are in contrast to the types of tools that were used on <i>Damogen Furies</i>.</p>
      <p>To support the new album, Jenkinson will also tour around North America, the UK and Europe in the spring.  </p>
      <p><i>Be Up A Hello</i> will be on January 31, 2020 via <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/warp-records/">Warp</a>.
