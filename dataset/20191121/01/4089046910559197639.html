      <p>The 30-year-old yeshiva teacher is in critical condition.</p>
      <p>“It was an attempted murder the way I see it,” Ramapo Police Chief Brad Weidel said. “A vicious, violent attack."</p>
      <p>Weidel said the victim was approached from behind by at least one or two individuals on the way to synagogue.</p>
      <p>The victim was brutally beaten and stabbed.</p>
      <p>The motive is not yet known, but the possibility of the attack being a hate crime is sending shock waves through the Hasidic community.</p>
      <p>“We’re doing everything we can,” Weidel said. “We need the community to call us if there’s something that doesn’t seem right or look right.”</p>
