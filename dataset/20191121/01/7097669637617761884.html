      <p>Manila (AFP) - Philippine police were ordered Wednesday to arrest anyone caught vaping in public, just hours after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte announced he would ban e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>The abrupt prohibition, revealed by Duterte late Tuesday adds to a growing global backlash against a product once promoted as less harmful than tobacco smoking.</p>
      <p>Duterte, a former smoker, called the devices "toxic" and said vaping introduced "chemicals" into the user's body.</p>
      <p>He ordered the arrest of anyone vaping publicly in a country that already has some of Asia's toughest anti-smoking rules.</p>
      <p>No formal, written order has been made public that spells out the scope of the ban or penalties for violations.</p>
      <p>Duterte is notorious internationally for his deadly anti-narcotics crackdown, but he has also targeted tobacco with a wide-ranging ban on smoking in public.</p>
      <p>Citing "the order of the president", on Wednesday a statement from the head of the Philippine police ordered "effective today, all police units nationwide to enforce the ban on use of vapes; ensure that all violators will be arrested".</p>
      <p>The ban came days after Philippine health authorities reported the nation's first vaping-related lung injury, which resulted in a 16-year-old girl being hospitalised.</p>
      <p>Vaping has taken off in the Philippines, with speciality shops and vapers puffing away in public a common sight.</p>
      <p>E-cigarette users were caught off guard by the ban and questioned the utility of arresting people who, at worst, were hurting themselves.</p>
      <p>"It's inappropriate. In any case, we don't hurt people, the environment or animals," said 22-year-old student Alexis Martin.</p>
      <p>"Why are vapers being targeted?"</p>
      <p>E-cigarettes warm flavoured liquid to produce vapour that is free of the estimated 7,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, but does contain a number of substances that could potentially be harmful.</p>
      <p>Critics say that apart from being harmful in themselves, the multiple exotic flavours of e-cigarette liquids appeal particularly to youngsters and risk getting them addicted to nicotine.</p>
      <p>The devices have become hugely popular in the past decade but a rash of vaping-linked deaths and illnesses in the United States is feeding caution about the product, already banned in some places.</p>
      <p>In September 2019 India became the latest country to ban the import, sale, production and advertising of e-cigarettes, citing in particular concerns for its youth.</p>
      <p>The devices are already banned in several places such as Brazil, Singapore, Thailand and the US state of Massachusetts.</p>
