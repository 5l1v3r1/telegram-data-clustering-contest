      <h1>Mitch Love, #FreeQuilty, and an NPR news quiz show</h1>
      <h2>The Everett Silvertips legend was drafted into a segment on “Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:23:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.heraldnet.com/author/npatterson/" target="_blank">Nick Patterson</a></address>
      <p>It turns out <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/sports/back-with-blades-mitch-love-still-calls-everett-home/">Mitch Love’s return to Everett</a> isn’t the only way in which the longtime Everett Silvertips icon made headlines this week.</p>
      <p>First off, a tip of the hat to Chad Balcom, who hosts the <a href="https://twitter.com/pucklandia?lang=en">Portland Winterhawks podcast Pucklandia</a> and co-hosts the <a href="https://twitter.com/whlunfiltered?lang=en">WHL podcast WHL Unfiltered</a> for alerting us to this.</p>
      <p>So NPR has a weekend radio show called “Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me!” which is a humorous game show-like rundown of the week’s news headlines. One of the segments in each week’s show is called “Bluff the Listener,” in which that week’s three celebrity panelists read outrageous news stories related to a single subject, only one of which is true. It’s up to a call-in listener to guess which of the three stories is actually true.</p>
      <p>Well, this Saturday’s “Bluff the Listener” news stories all dealt with the hashtag #FreeQuilty and what that meant. Love, in his role as the Saskatoon Blades’ head coach, was drafted into one of the stories, which involved toilet paper,the team’s mascot and … well, I’ll leave the rest to you.</p>
      <p>You can <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/16/779987791/bluff-the-listener">listen to the segment or read a </a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/16/779987791/bluff-the-listener">transcript</a> on NPR’s website.</p>
