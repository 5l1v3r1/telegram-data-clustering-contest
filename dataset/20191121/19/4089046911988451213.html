      <p><b>JEFFERSON COUNTY, Tenn. (WVLT) --</b> In March, a <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/JCSO-Homicide-investigation-opened-after-body-discovered-507045551.html">body was found in a "suspicious bag"</a> in Jefferson County.

      <p>On March 10, the body, thought to belong to an adult male, was discovered in a golf travel bag on the lake shore near Lake Ridge Drive in Dandridge.</p>
      <p>The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation gave details to the public in the hopes that the body would be identified:</p>
      <p>- Body was wearing a Walking Dead t-shirt<br/>- Investigators found a belt with the name "Gerald" on his clothing<br/>- Belt buckle has a horse and horseshoe in the center as well as an eagle pattern</p>
      <p>Investigators have not been able to identify the victim's exact age, race or height.</p>
      <p>TBI said, "We're hoping the public can help us identify the man based on some of the clothing he was wearing."</p>
      <p>Anyone with any information is asked to call TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND.</p>
