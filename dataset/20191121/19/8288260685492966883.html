      <h4>Mourinho eyes European pair</h4>
      <p>Bruno Fernandes and Pablo Dybala could be back on Spurs' radar in January.</p>
      <p>Dybala was close to joining Tottenham in the summer under Mauricio Pochettino but a deal collapsed towards the end of the window, while Fernandes was also linked with north London club throughout the summer.</p>
      <p>And now the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1207203/Jose-Mourinho-Tottenham-transfer-news-Bruno-Fernandes-Man-Utd-revenge">Express</a> are reporting that new Spurs boss Jose Mourinho is keen on the pair in the winter window.</p>
      <h4>Aubameyang to reject new Arsenal deal</h4>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is set to reject a new Arsenal deal.</p>
      <p>According to Spanish newspaper Sport, Aubameyang is waiting to see whether Barcelona make a move for him.</p>
      <p>The Gabon striker's current deal runs until 2021, but the Gunners are keen to extend.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Tottenham considered both Rodgers and Nagelsmann</h4>
      <p>Tottenham considered both Brendan Rodgers and Julian Nagelsmann as candidates to replace Mauricio Pochettino, before appointing Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was appointed as Tottenham manager on Wednesday morning, but it according to reports, he was not the club’s first choice.</p>
      <p>But according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705673/Jose-Mourinhos-arrival-month-pipeline-Spurs-manager-shock-unfolded.html">Mail</a> , Rodgers and Nagelsmann were both considered for the role, but</p>
      <p>Spurs thought it would be too difficult to secure them.</p>
      <h4>Pochettino on Bayern’s radar</h4>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is being considered by Bayern Munich to take over as manager at the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>Although, according to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/transfer-centre">Sky Sports</a> , no contact has been made with the Argentine following his sacking by Tottenham on Tuesday, it is believed he is on their shortlist of candidates.</p>
      <p>Bayern have been without a permanent manager after Niko Kovac was sacked by the German giants at the start of November.</p>
