      <p><b>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP)</b> - Several figures in the political party of former Bolivian President Evo Morales are gaining prominence as the country struggles to stabilize after a month of deadly violence.</p>
      <p>The emergence of new indigenous leaders in the Movement Toward Socialism party raises questions about the role of Morales, who resigned Nov. 10 after a disputed election in October and sought asylum in Mexico.</p>
      <p>There appear to be divisions in the party, with some members saying Morales should let others lead. However, one party lawmaker has suggested Morales is entitled to be a candidate in any new elections.</p>
      <p>Bolivia's interim president, Jeanine Áñez, has sent a bill on holding new elections to congress, which is dominated by the Movement Toward Socialism.</p>
      <p>Morales claimed victory in last month's vote, but the opposition alleged fraud.</p>
