      <h1>ITV Emmerdale fans compelling theory over what will happen to Leanna</h1>
      <h2>Viewers think they know what's next for the teenager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:57:15+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>Emmerdale fans have an interesting theory about Leanna's future after her tryst with Jacob.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/jacobs-disgusting-actions-leave-emmerdale-17290357">Jacob and Leanna</a> had sex in last night's episode, after Leanna had had a crush on him for weeks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-emmerdale-fans-stunned-casting-17221245">Viewers were stunned</a> last night as Jacob left her just minutes after their afternoon of passion, despite it being her first time.</p>
      <p>Jacob is struggling to come to terms with Maya being released from prison, with fans seeing her walking out of the prison heavily pregnant, presumably with his baby.</p>

      <p>And now <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-emmerdale-recasts-asan-njies-17220935">eagle-eyed fans</a> think that Leanna might also become pregnant with Jacob's baby, and many of them took to social media to voice their theory.</p>
      <p>Lizzy said: "So wait is Leanna also gonna get pregnant with Jacobs kid."</p>
      <p>Sarah Freer said: "It wouldn’t surprise me if Leanna gets pregnant too, then that’s two women he’s got pregnant."</p>

      <p>And Elaine said: "I bet it's <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23davidmetcalfes">#davidmetcalfes</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23emmerdale">#emmerdale</a> odds leanna is pregnant as well."</p>
      <p>Tonight's episode saw Leanna try and persuade Bernice to get the morning after pill for her, after revealing her and Jacob hadn't used any form of protection.</p>
      <p>Bernice handed over the pill and told her it was totally normal if she felt sick after it, and sure enough she was shortly after all over her dad.</p>
      <p>She ended up revealing all to her dad, who went ballastic at Jacob for "using" his daughter.</p>
