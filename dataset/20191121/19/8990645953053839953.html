      <p>Is there someone on your holiday list that would absolutely love to have a group of carolers serenade them but you know in your heart that you can’t carry a tune in a tinsel-covered bucket with a candy-cane handle? Fear not, for those intrepid young thespians from <a href="https://www.backdoortheatre.org/">Backdoor Theatre</a> are ready to help you out.</p>
      <p>For the small fee of just $50 a group of talented individuals from Backdoor Theatre’s Youth Troupe will perform at your party or send a singing telegram to the person of your choice to liven up their holiday. The troupe will perform a 15-minute selection of classic carols leaving everyone with the warm, fuzzy happiness that only Christmas carols, or a cup of hot cocoa, can bring.</p>
      <p>Funds raised through Carols For Cash will go toward Backdoor Theatre’s Youth Education Program and TNT Festival Fees so not only will you get a very special concert, you'll also be doing something to promote live theatre and the performing arts in Wichita Falls.</p>
      <p>The location must be within Wichita Falls city limits and their schedule is filling up fast so <a href="https://www.backdoortheatre.org/purchase-tickets.html">book your private Christmas concert now</a>.</p>
