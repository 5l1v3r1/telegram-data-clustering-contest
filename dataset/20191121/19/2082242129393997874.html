      <p>New coach, who dis?</p>
      <p>I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Toronto Maple Leafs begin life with a new head coach tonight in Arizona. Sheldon Keefe is in charge and he quickly made changes to the lineup. Let’s have a look.</p>
      <p>First up, the power play:</p>
      <p>Andreas Johnsson is off the first unit, replaced with Tyson Barrie on the wing. This is presumably to have a shooter on each side and William Nylander in the middle. There’s also clear space to insert <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/257874/mitchell-marner">Mitchell Marner</a> without taking Nylander off the power play.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/326197/andreas-johnsson">Johnsson</a> has moved to the second unit, solidifying his demotion. He’s joined by the usual customers, save <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/298199/zach-hyman">Zach Hyman</a>, whom he replaced.</p>

      <p>Next, the lines.</p>
      <h3>Maple Leafs Lines</h3>
      <p>The biggest change comes with <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/326213/zach-hyman">Hyman</a> moving from the left wing to the right wing, his natural side. He replaces Kasperi Kapanen, who moves down to his regular spot on the third line. Ilya Mikheyev is up on the second line as the left winger.</p>
      <p>On the third line, Alex Kerfoot is practicing on the left wing, with Jason Spezza at his centre. I’m not sure this is the game-time solution, as I’m not convinced Kerfoot is cleared to play. What Keefe does with <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/329887/jason-spezza">Spezza</a> when Kerfoot is ready will be telling to what position he thinks Kerfoot is able to play.</p>
      <p>On defense, Keefe has made no changes.</p>
      <p>My guess is the Leafs are giving this group a few games as a try-out to see if they can play under the new coach. Roster changes might follow next week.</p>
