      <p>In a world where laptops are commonplace and seemingly cast in the same mold, Lenovo’s YOGA, IdeaPad, and Legion lines, loaded with unique and premium features, enable users to unleash their potential, at both work and play. Purchases of select Lenovo IdeaPad, YOGA, and Legion devices made from November 15 until December 31, 2019 qualify for a chance to win up to PHP 30,000 worth of Herschel e-vouchers, Planet Sports gift cheques, and Lenovo accessories. To celebrate the launch of the #BRINGDIFFERENT and #SPORTYOURGAME promos, Lenovo held a special fashion show event at The Plaza, Resorts World Manila in Pasay City. Models walked the runway with the latest Lenovo devices while also donning Herschel and Planet Sports gear. “Christmas is all about spreading joy and to make it extra special this year, we’ve partnered with two well-known brands whose products share the same key characteristics that encapsulate the Lenovo brand ─ incredible durability, style, and attention to detail. This promotion is also our way of thanking loyal customers for helping us achieve many milestones this year,” said <b><i>Lenovo Philippines Country General Manager Michael Ngan.</i></b> For its #SPORTYOURGAME campaign, Lenovo Legion partnered with Planet Sports, a multi-brand concept store that imports and distributes globally recognized sports and lifestyle gear. Lenovo IdeaPad and YOGA, on the other hand, partnered with Canada-based Herschel Supply Co., a design-driven accessories brand that produces quality products available all over the world for its #BRINGDIFFERENT campaign. Herschel’s line comprises of backpacks, duffel bags, headwear, wallets, and even accessories such as laptop bags and sleeves which Lenovo users can use to protect their devices. The amount of e-vouchers to be given away depends on the device’s model and processor.
