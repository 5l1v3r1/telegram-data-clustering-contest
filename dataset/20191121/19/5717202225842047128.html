        <b>Pablo Hernandez <a href="https://twitter.com/LUFC/status/1197500052958318592?s=20">has told Leeds United’s official Twitter account</a> that Tyler Roberts has big potential, before lauding the improvement that the Wales international has made over the last month.</b>

      <p>Roberts was arguably one of Leeds’s most impressive players in the build-up to the international break. The 20-year-old scored against Queens Park Rangers, while he also played a key role in the Whites’ opening goal against Blackburn Rovers.</p>

      <p>It has been a fantastic comeback for the former West Brom man. He was sidelined for five months earlier in the year. And some may have feared that his confidence would take a knock when he was substituted after coming on in the win against the Baggies in October.</p>
      <p>But Roberts has responded superbly. And Hernandez insisted that he expects the youngster to enjoy an incredibly bright future – potentially at the highest level.</p>

      <p>“I think everyone sees that Tyler has big potential,” he said, <a href="https://twitter.com/LUFC/status/1197500052958318592?s=20">as reported by Leeds’s official Twitter account</a>.</p>
      <p>“He’s young and I think he’s improved in the last month. And I think he has a good future here at Leeds. He plays with the national team. It is not easy today to play in the national teams.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s a great player. He has great skills. And I think that he can play for Leeds United in the next years, I hope in the Premier League.”</p>
      <p>Roberts has shown since Marcelo Bielsa’s arrival that he is capable of moments of brilliance. He was arguably reaching another level last season before injury struck.</p>
      <p>He has not taken a lot of time to get back on track this term. And with players like Hernandez around him, the forward looks to have a fantastic chance of realising his full potential.</p>
