      <h1>Cricket: Australian bowlers bounce back from slow start to dismiss Pakistan for 240</h1>

      <p>Australia’s bowling attack has rebounded from a slow start to dismiss Pakistan for 240 late on day one of the First Test at the Gabba on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Having gone to lunch wicketless as Pakistan reached 0-75, the much-vaunted Australian bowling attack took 4-3 in a seven-over blitz on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Pakistan openers Azhar Ali and Shan Masoon had become the first tourists to bat through the opening session of a Test at the Gabba without loss, but momentum soon switched dramatically.</p>
      <p>Josh Hazlewood bagged two wickets and Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc each claimed one, before spinner Nathan Lyon also joined the party to leave the tourists reeling at 5-94.</p>

      <p>Cummins finished with figures of 3-60 in his first home Test since claiming the mantle of the world’s best bowler.</p>
      <p>He was fortunate to have Muhammad Rizwan caught behind after tea off what appeared to be a no-ball.</p>
      <p>English third umpire Michael Gough watched several replays of the Aussie quick’s foot landing on the line, before declaring it a fair delivery and Muhammad was sent on his way.</p>

      <p>Starc also had 4-52 and went within a whisker of a hat-trick, before claiming the final wicket on what proved to be the final ball of the opening day.</p>
      <p>The left-arm quick showed again why he is the world’s most dangerous bowler against tailenders.</p>
      <p>He produced a ripper to clean up Yasir Shah via a late-inswinging yorker with the second new ball, before having Shaheen Shah Afridi caught behind next ball.</p>
      <p>The left-armer was unlucky not to claim a hat-trick, with 16-year-old debutant Naseem Shah inside edging a ball past his stumps to deny Starc.</p>
      <p>Cummins produced a beauty to beat the resilient defence of Asad Shafiq, cutting a ball back between bat and pad.</p>
      <p>It ended a resolute 134-ball innings from the Pakistani No.4, with his 76 keeping the tourists in the battle in the last session.</p>

      <p>Just 13,561 paying spectators watched Pakistan battle a patient Australian bowling attack on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Not since 2015 has the Gabba hosted the first Test of the summer against a side other than England, when a day-one crowd of 16,181 watched Australia and New Zealand.</p>

      <p>Pakistan is attempting to claim a first Test win in Australia since 1995 in this two-Test series.</p>
      <p>It has never won a series in the country from 12 attempts, nor won at the Gabba, with the Aussies unbeaten at the ground against any team in Test cricket since 1988.</p>
