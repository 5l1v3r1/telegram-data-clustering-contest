      <h1>Jeep Starts Paying Truck Owners To Buy Gladiators</h1>
      <h2>Nothing like getting free money.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:35:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/jeep/gladiator">Jeep Gladiator</a> is a bona fide sales success, but the automaker continues its efforts to sell as many as its Toledo, Ohio factory can build. Since going on sale earlier this year, over 16,000 Gladiators have been sold. And with an average price of around $56,000, Jeep and parent company FCA are earning solid profits.</p>
      <p>eep wants to end the year with a bang and one way of making that happen is to sell more Gladiators. But, of course, buyers need to be enticed. <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/deals-articles/jeep-is-paying-pickup-owners-2-000-to-buy-the-gladiator">Cars Direct</a> has uncovered a bulletin sent to Jeep dealerships authorizing an old but useful sales tactic, the conquest bonus.</p>
      <p>This is simply a discount designed specifically to get buyers to switch brands. Jeep is apparently sending a promotional offer, via either direct mail or email, to certain groups of truck owners in the US that's worth $2,000 towards a new Gladiator.</p>

      <p>Turns out this is the single largest discount to date on the 2020 Gladiator. In fact, this offer is double that of <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/jeep-tempts-customers-with-gladiator-discount">last month's loyalty discount</a> that targeted Jeep owners. There is one downside, however. The offer cannot be applied towards the top-of-the-line Gladiator Rubicon trim. If you recall, Jeep recently <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/think-the-2020-jeep-gladiator-is-way-too-expensive-just-wait">increased the Rubicon trim's price by $330</a> without explanation.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, there are three other great Gladiator trim levels available: Sport, Sport S, and Overland. The Sport's MSRP is currently $33,545 without any added options. Combined with this latest discount, assuming you're coming from a rival brand, that price drops to $31,545.</p>

      <p>This still gets you a new Gladiator with standard V6 power, a six-speed manual transmission, 17-inch wheels, and a 5-inch Uconnect touchscreen display. Meanwhile, the Sport S and Overland begin at $36,940 and $40,590, respectively. Another added benefit to the $2,000 conquest bonus is that it can be shared with immediate family in the same household.</p>
      <p>If you're thinking about replacing that <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/colorado">Chevy Colorado</a> or <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/nissan/frontier">Nissan Frontier</a> with something a bit different with classic Jeep looks, be sure to keep an eye out on your mailbox.</p>
