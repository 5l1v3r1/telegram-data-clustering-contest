      <p>First published by Marvel Comics -- then known as Timely Comics -- in 1939, <i>Marvel Comics</i> #1 is considered to be the catalyst of Marvel's superhero universe as we know it today. The issue features the first appearances of such characters as the Human Torch (Jim Hammond), Angel (Thomas Halloway), and Ka-Zar, not to mention the first Marvel/Timely appearance of Namor the Sub-Mariner (who previously debuted in <i>Motion Picture Funnies Weekly</i>).</p>
      <p><i>Marvel Comics</i> #1 features the work of such prominent early Marvel creators as Bill Everett, Carl Burgos and Paul Gustavson, not not mention cover art by noted sci-fi artist Frank R. Paul. The particular copy sold at Heritage's action was first purchased off a newsrack by a mailman in Uniontown, Pa. -- who made it a point to purchase as many first issues of comics and magazines as he could.</p>
      <p>"This is a historic copy of a historic comic book," said Heritage Auctions Senior Vice President Ed Jaster. "Without question, this is the granddaddy of all Marvel Comics, without which we would not have the characters and stories we enjoy in today’s comics and feature films."</p>
