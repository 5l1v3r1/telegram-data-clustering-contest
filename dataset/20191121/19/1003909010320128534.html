      <p><b><a href="https://www.greycupfestival.ca/">Grey Cup Festival</a></b><br/>Where: Stampede Park<br/>When: Until Nov. 23</p>
      <p>The big game is in town this weekend and you can celebrate without shelling out cash for tickets to see the Blue Bombers and TiCats play in the actual game on Sunday. The fan festival features fun like a tub eslide, music, beer gardens, mini field, photo ops, pancake breakfasts and a fireworks show each evening. You can see the full list of events at <a href="https://www.greycupfestival.ca/events/">greycupfestival.ca</a>.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://albertatheatreprojects.com/whats-on/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe/">The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe</a></b><br/>Where: Martha Cohen Theatre, Arts Commons<br/>When: Until Dec. 29</p>
      <p>For this year’s holiday show, Alberta Theatre Projects brings the Chronicles of Narnia novel series to the stage. The show is recommended for ages five plus. Tickets start at $35.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.calgaryzoo.com/zoolights">Zoolights</a></b><br/>Where: Calgary Zoo<br/>When: Nov. 22 to Jan. 4</p>
      <p>The Calgary Zoo puts the animals away for the evening and brings out bright approximations for this annual tradition, which also features Santa, a skating rink, axe-throwing, and magical classes and crafts. Admission is $19.95 for adults and $14.95 for children.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.westbrookmall.com/events/westbrook-join-us-for-a-visit-with-the-mean-one">The Mean One</a></b><br/>Where: Westbrook Mall<br/>When: Nov. 22-24</p>
      <p>Westbrook Mall offers an alternative to the cheeriness of Santa when “the mean one” drops by. He’s as cuddly as a cactus and as charming as an eel, but I’m guessing they’re not touching his true name with a 39-and-a-half foot pole for a (legal) reason. Check him out 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 4-8 p.m. on Friday, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2-6 p.m. on Saturday, and noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.auarts.ca/auarts-sa-fall-show-sale-2019">AUArts Students’ Association Fall Show + Sale</a></b><br/>Where: Alberta University of the Arts<br/>When: Nov. 22-24</p>
      <p>The students of Calgary’s art school offer a market of creative gifts (for your Christmas shopping list or for you) including works in painting, drawing, glass, jewelry, metals, fibre, printmaking, sculpture, media arts, photography, ceramics and design. The sale runs noon to 6 p.m. on Saturday and noon to 4 p.m. on Sunday with a fundraiser Friday night that runs 5-8 p.m. Entry each day is by donation except for Friday, when it costs $25 per person.</p>
