      <h1>Diplomat seen rolling his eyes amid testy impeachment exchange with Jordan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:31:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/brett-samuels" target="_blank">Brett Samuels</a></address>
      <p>Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jim-jordan">Jim Jordan</a> (R-Ohio) clashed with State Department official David Holmes during a particularly testy exchange in Thursday's impeachment hearing in which the congressman repeatedly interrupted the witness and at one point prompted an eye roll from him.</p>
      <p>Jordan pressed Holmes on why diplomat William Taylor did not bring up that Holmes had overheard the president talking to U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> about investigations in a phone call.</p>
      <p>"You said this was extremely distinctive experience, one of the most remarkable events of my life," Jordan said, recounting Holmes's description of the call.</p>
      <p>Holmes was captured by cameras in the room rolling his eyes as Jordan spoke, and he could be seen holding back a smile as the congressman listed off the numerous other conversations Taylor brought up to lawmakers.</p>

      <p>Jordan suggested that if the call was as damaging as Holmes asserted, Taylor would have brought it up during his own testimony to lawmakers a week earlier.</p>
      <p>But Holmes explained that he told a different supervisor about the Trump-Sondland call at the time, and did not inform Taylor about it himself until after he came back from a weeklong vacation. He came to believe that Taylor was already aware of the contents of the conversation by the time they spoke.</p>
      <p>"Did I go through every single word in the call?" Holmes said. "No, because everyone by that point agreed. It was obvious what the president was pressing for."</p>
      <p>Jordan tried to cut in multiple times as Holmes spoke, prompting the witness to shake his head and leading House Intelligence Committee Chairman <a href="https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a> (D-Calif.) to gavel down Jordan multiple times, imploring him to let Holmes speak.</p>
      <p>"Mr. Jordan, you may not like the witness’s answer but we will hear it," Schiff said.</p>
      <p>Jordan was added to the Intelligence Committee just before the public impeachment hearings began. He is viewed as one of Trump's most loyal allies and a strong attack dog for questioning witnesses and pushing GOP arguments.</p>
