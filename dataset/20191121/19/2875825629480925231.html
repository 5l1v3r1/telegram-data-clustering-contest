      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:05:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/Olivia_Kelleher/" target="_blank">Olivia Kelleher</a></address>
      <p>A bricklayer who knocked out a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/an-garda-siochana">Garda</a> celebrating a stag night has avoided prison with a suspended sentence.</p>
      <p>Thug James McCarthy launched the unprovoked attack on off-duty cop Shane O’Connor at a bar in Cork, a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/courts">court</a> heard.</p>
      <p>But McCarthy received an 18 month suspended sentence for the assault, meaning he won’t spend a day in prison.</p>
      <p>The construction worker, from Mount Agnes Road in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cork">Cork</a>, had pleaded guilty to assault causing harm at Soho on Grand Parade on June 17, 2018.</p>
      <p>Cork Circuit Criminal Court heard that McCarthy, 34, got into an argument with one of the off duty Garda’s friends and took exception to what this man said.</p>
      <p>Mr O’Connor had nothing to do with the exchange of words but as it escalated he intervened to calm the situation.</p>

      <p>Det Sgt Shane Bergin told Judge Sean O’Donnabhain that McCarthy “misread the situation and punched him (O’Connor) in the face”.</p>
      <p>McCarthy, who had no previous convictions, left the bar/nightclub.</p>
      <p>But the incident was captured on CCTV and he was later identified. When arrested by gardai McCarthy admitted assaulting Mr O’Connor.</p>
      <p>He sustained a 4cm cut to his face in the incident, needed six stitches and has a permanent scar.</p>
      <p>He woke up in hospital to be told that he could have a bleed on the brain and that “plastics will be along later for a scar on your face”.</p>
      <p>The Garda was out of work for a few weeks. Headaches are an issue for him since the assault.</p>
      <p>However, he has made a successful recovery from his injuries.</p>
      <p>McCarthy has paid €8,500 to the Garda in compensation. He has also apologised for his actions.</p>
      <p>Judge O’Donnabhain sentenced McCarthy to 18 months in prison.</p>
      <p>However, he suspended the entirety of the sentence on condition that McCarthy keeps the peace and is of good behaviour for 18 months.</p>
