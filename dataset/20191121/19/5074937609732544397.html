      <p>Accra, Nov 21, GNA - The Deputy Managing Director of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) Mr Alhassan Yakubu-Tali has re-affirmed the commitment of the Bank towards the successful organisation of the 35th National Farmers Day Celebration.</p>
      <p>Making a donation as the lead sponsor of the National Best Farmers’ Award, the Deputy Managing Director said the Bank’s association and continuous sponsorship of the Welcome Cocktail, the Farmer’s Forum and also the Ultimate Prize was all targeted at attracting more people into agriculture.</p>
      <p>“The sponsorship package by ADB for the past 35 editions remains the topmost award for our Farmers and has also served as an incentive for our gallant Farmers and Fishers to aim at the ultimate prize,” he said.</p>
      <p>ADB presented a sponsorship cheque for Five Hundred and Thirty Six Thousand Ghana Cedis (GH¢536,000.00) the cedi equivalent of (US$100,000.00) One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars to the Minister of State at the Ministry of Food and Agriculture &amp; Chairman Of the Planning Committee, Dr. Gyiele Nurah in Accra.</p>
      <p>Mr Yakubu-Tali said the sponsorship was a further indication of the Bank’s desire to remain focused on its founding mandate to provide financial intermediation to players within the agricultural sector.</p>
      <p>“On behalf of the Board and Management of ADB, I wish to inform the public that since 2018, the Bank has refocused and highlighted our agricultural financing strategy to encompass the complete Agricultural Value Chain,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Yakubu-Tali said the Bank hitherto provided past national Best Farmers with fully furnished three bedroom houses at places of their choice.</p>
      <p>In 2017, following strong advocacy and presentations by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and Past National Best Farmers, a decision was taken  to change the ultimate prize from the three bedroom house into cash prize.</p>
      <p>The cash prize is to enable the award winner invest the cash award to expand their businesses and provide additional employment.</p>
      <p>So far the 2017 and 2018 best farmers have prudently utilised their prize monies in that direction.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Managing Director said that the new initiative yielded good results and was hopeful it will continue since both the 2017 and 2018 Winners had all employed more people and also expanded their various agribusinesses.</p>
      <p>Receiving the sponsorship on behalf of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Honourable Minister of State &amp; Chairman Of the Planning Committee, Dr. Gyiele Nurah commended the Bank for its commitment to the National Farmers Day Celebration.</p>
      <p>“ADB has shown commitment towards all the 35 editions by being the lead sponsor of the ultimate prize and also the organizers of the National Farmers Forum and the Welcome Cocktail,”</p>
