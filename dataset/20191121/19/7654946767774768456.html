      <p>Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg took another step toward <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/michael-bloomberg-again-eyeing-2020-presidential-bid-sources/">launching a Democratic bid for president</a> on Thursday, filing paperwork with federal election authorities that will allow him to raise money for his campaign.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg filed the paperwork with the Federal Election Commission Thursday as his political operation continues to work the ground in preparation for a bid.</p>
      <p>The billionaire media mogul announced Wednesday that he will <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/bloomberg-will-drop-20m-to-defeat-trump-in-battleground-states/">spend $15 million to $20 million</a> on a voter registration drive in battleground states to help the Democrats defeat President Trump in the general election.</p>
      <p>That’s on top of the $100 million he’s already promised to spend on ads targeting Trump in battleground states.</p>
