      <h1>Trump signs spending bill to avoid shutdown until late December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:25:24+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author">Clyde Hughes &amp; Daniel Uria</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> on Thursday signed a spending bill averting a a potential federal shutdown until December.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/politics/senate-government-shutdown-deadline/index.html">The measure</a> will give Congress four extra weeks to produce a larger spending agreement, which has so far been hindered by disagreement over funding for the president's border wall.</p>
      <p>The Senate passed the measure by a vote <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00365">of 74-20</a> earlier Thursday.</p>
      <p>"If we don't get it done and continue to slow-walk, we will be where we are today," said Sen. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Richard_Shelby/?tps=1">Richard Shelby</a>, R-Ala., the chairman of the Senate appropriations committee.</p>
      <p>Shelby added that Treasury Secretary <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Steven-Mnuchin/?tps=1">Steven Mnuchin</a> helped move negotiations along. The resolution was passed by the House <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/20/House-sends-Senate-stopgap-bill-to-avert-government-shutdown/1171574239845/?upi_ss=shutdown">Tuesday</a>.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers are still working on a bipartisan agreement involving 12 regular annual appropriations bills that are needed to fund the government. Congress passed a short-term extension at the end of September, which was set to expire at midnight Thursday.</p>
      <p>Trump's push for a new wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is the same issue that led to a 35-day federal shutdown late last year.</p>
      <p>"The wall, I think, is the major impediment [to a spending agreement]," House Democratic leader <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Steny_Hoyer/?tps=1">Steny Hoyer</a> <a href="https://m.cnn.com/en/article/h_dab8c07e841fb87c524658874d9df340">said</a> this week.</p>
