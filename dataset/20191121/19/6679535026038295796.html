      <h1>Hat-trick at his last chance in festival</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:22:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/R-K-Roshni-1708/" target="_blank">R.K. Roshni</a></address>
      <p>Goutham M. scored a hat-trick in his last appearance at the Revenue District School Arts Festival on Thursday.</p>
      <p>A Plus Two student of St. Mary’s Higher Secondary School, Pattom, Gautham secured first A grade in Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, and Folk Dance.</p>
      <p>Goutham has been securing the first position in all three events for the past four years.</p>
      <p>He has also done well in the State School Arts Festival in the past. At last year’s festival, he got second A grade in Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi and A grade in Folk Dance. The year before that, he secured first A grade in folk dance, second A grade in Kuchipudi, and third A grade in Bharatanatyam.</p>
      <p>Goutham has been learning dance under Attingal Joshi. It is Bharatanatyam that he is learning in-depth. Mr. Joshi has been teaching dance to Goutham and some other students for free taking into consideration the financial situation of his family, says Goutham.</p>
      <p>A Bio-Maths student, he wants to take a crack at the entrance examinations but feels that studying for those along with Plus Two and pursuing his passion for dance together may be difficult.</p>
