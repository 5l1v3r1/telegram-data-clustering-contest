      <p>BOSTON — Amid a difficult stretch in which the Buffalo Sabres had lost eight of their last nine games, Ralph Krueger took a few minutes Wednesday night to call his close friend, Mike Babcock.</p>
      <p>Babcock had just been fired as coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs after amassing 173 regular-season wins across four-plus years. The two men have stayed in close contact since they worked together on Canada's staff for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and share some of the same hobbies.</p>
      <p>The conversation included a suggestion from the Sabres' coach.</p>
      <p>"We spoke pretty quick after the situation, and I’m happy to see him being a winner in the process," Krueger said Thursday morning in TD Garden ahead of a game against the Boston Bruins. "We had a fabulous year together on the way to Sochi and I’ve stayed in contact ever since. Have a lot of hobbies in the summer, like water skiing, together. I told him to go get a ski out and he said, ‘Yeah, that’s a good idea.’ You don’t expect to water ski this time of year. Mike will definitely grow and learn from this."</p>
      <p>Babcock was dismissed Wednesday after a 9-10-4 start to the season. He led the Maple Leafs to three consecutive playoff appearances and took over a team that had won a combined 59 games over the previous two seasons.</p>
      <p>Krueger credits Babcock for making a return to the National Hockey League possible. The two spoke routinely while Krueger served as chairman of English Premier League's Southampton F.C. for five years. Their relationship began in 2004, though, when Krueger coached against Babcock at the IIHF World Championship.</p>
      <p>Canada defeated Switzerland, which was coached by Krueger, during its run toward the gold medal. They then worked together for roughly one year in preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Krueger was tasked with scouting the European opponents in a consultant role.</p>
      <p>That job came shortly after Krueger's three-year run in the NHL. He spent two seasons as an assistant in Edmonton under Tom Renney and was promoted to head coach for the 2012-13 season. Krueger was dismissed after only one year, despite having led the Oilers to a 19-22-7 record amid the lockout-shortened season.</p>
      <p>Babcock, who won the Stanley Cup in Detroit, went a combined 173-133-45 during his time with Toronto, but his philosophies never seemed to align with General Manager Kyle Dubas. Additionally, the Leafs had three consecutive first-round exits in the playoffs.</p>

      <p>"I’m sure he’ll be back in the game soon, and he’s been an excellent partner for me in this process," Krueger said of Babcock. "He’s one of the key people that have made it possible for me to return to the National Hockey League, so I’m grateful for that, and I know Mike will make winning decisions here to find good solutions in the future. He’s done excellent work in Toronto. He’s taken that franchise to another level in his five years. It will be interesting to see where he goes, but I hope he goes hunting now first."</p>
      <h3>Minors update</h3>
      <p>Despite dealing with injuries and the absence of their head coach, the Rochester Americans enter this weekend second in the American Hockey League's Atlantic division with a 10-3-3 record. They could potentially benefit from the departure of Toronto Marlies coach Sheldon Keefe, who was named Babcock's replacement.</p>
      <p>Keefe, 39, played 125 games in the NHL with Tampa Bay and spent his last season in 2004-05 on the AHL's Utah Grizzlies, where Amerks interim coach Gord Dineen was an assistant. Keefe played only four games that season because of a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Keefe's Marlies eliminated the Amerks in the first round of last season's Calder Cup playoffs.</p>
      <p>"He studies the game probably as much as anybody," Dineen said of Keefe. "He kind of eats, breathes and sleeps it. He's right on top of it. He's not afraid to be innovative. He's a pretty innovative coach. I'm sure in Toronto it seems like they were ready for a different voice in that dressing room."</p>
      <p>The Amerks host Hartford on Friday night, followed by a road game Saturday at Binghamton. Rochester forward Scott Wilson returned to practice this week as he works his way back from a lower-body injury.</p>
      <p>Cincinnati, meanwhile, enters the weekend first in the ECHL's Central division with a 10-5-1 record. The Cyclones have won seven of their last 10 games and host Kalamazoo on Friday night.</p>
      <h3>Quarterly update</h3>
      <p>There were a few notable statistical trends around the National Hockey League over the season's first seven weeks. The 87 overtime or shootout games are the most through the first quarter of a season in league history, and there were 32 percent fewer coaches' challenges.</p>
      <p>The latter is the result of a significant rule change where an unsuccessful coaches' challenge results in a two-minute penalty. Additionally, the 6.2 total goals per game was the second-highest scoring output during the season's first quarter in the last 23 years.</p>
