      <p>Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded 2,172 cases and 42 deaths from the illness.</p>
      <p>U.S. officials recently said vitamin E acetate — believed to be used as a cutting agent in illicit vaping products containing marijuana components — was found in all lung samples from 29 patients who were tested.</p>
      <p>CDC has called vitamin E acetate a “chemical of concern” and recommended not adding it to e-cigarettes, or vaping products, while the investigation is underway.</p>
      <p>Investigators had earlier pointed to vaping oils containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, as being especially risky.</p>
      <p>The spate of serious respiratory illnesses has led to U.S. officials urging people to stop vaping, especially those products containing THC.</p>
      <p>As of Nov. 20, confirmed deaths were reported in 25 states and the District of Columbia, the CDC said. Louisiana became the newest state to report a death from the illness. (<a href="http://bit.ly/349bjM1">bit.ly/349bjM1</a>)</p>
