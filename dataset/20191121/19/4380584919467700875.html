      <h1>Owners approve Sherman's bid to buy Royals</h1>

      <p>As expected, Kansas City businessman John Sherman was approved by fellow MLB owners to be the next owner of the Kansas City Royals on Thursday at the annual Owners Meetings in Arlington.</p>
      <p>David Glass purchased the team in 2000 for $96 million. Sherman reportedly purchased the team for close to $1 billion, according to several sources.</p>
      <p>“The decision to sell the Royals was difficult for our family,” Glass said in a statement near the end of the season. “Our goal, which I firmly believe we’ve achieved, was to have someone local, who truly loved the game of baseball and who would be a great steward for this franchise going forward. In John Sherman, we have found everything we were looking for in taking ownership of this franchise.”</p>
      <p>Sherman, 64, is a minority owner of the Indians who will have to relinquish those holdings. He is expected to address the media early next week in Kansas City.</p>
      <p>Glass was the hand-picked successor to run the Royals after the team’s original owner, Ewing Kauffman, died in 1993. Glass oversaw Kauffman’s succession plan, which mandated that the proceeds from a sale of the club went directly to charity. Glass, after an unsuccessful attempt to find other suitable owners, purchased the team.</p>
      <p>After 20 years of ownership and a 2015 World Series title, Glass will sell the team to Sherman, a former Royals season-ticket holder who will keep the team thriving in Kansas City.</p>
      <p>Sherman has been a huge fan of the Royals for decades.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Sherman told the Kansas City Business Journal that he had planned a vacation in Europe during the Royals-Giants World Series in 2014, but that he kept getting up in the middle of the night to watch the games.</p>
      <p>Finally, Sherman’s wife, Marny, told him to go home early. He flew from Paris to Kansas City to catch Games 6 and 7 at Kauffman Stadium.</p>
      <p>“John has made a huge impact in our business community and is so passionate about baseball that he purchased an ownership stake in the Cleveland Indians three years ago to begin his relationship with this great game,” Glass said. “We are truly blessed to have someone of John’s stature and business acumen available to us from the metropolitan area to take the reins of this organization going forward.”</p>
      <p>Sherman’s management style has been described as “not hands-off,” but also not an “overbearing hands-on.”</p>
      <p>Sherman launched two successful gas-and-energy-based companies in Inergy and LPG Services Group, the latter of which merged with Dynegy. Inergy also merged with Crestwood Holdings, and Sherman still serves on that board of directors. He eventually sold off controlling interest of his companies.</p>
      <p>“I am enormously grateful to David and the Glass family for this extraordinary opportunity,” Sherman said in a statement in September, “and am humbled by the chance to team up with a distinguished group of local investors to carry forward and build on this rich Kansas City Royals legacy. Our goal will be threefold: To compete for a championship on behalf of our fans; to honor their passion, their experience and their unwavering commitment; and to carry their hopes and dreams forward in this great Kansas City region we all love for decades to come.”</p>
      <p>Sherman has in the past chaired the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City and the Truman Library Institute. He is also a trustee of the Kauffman Foundation and the National World War I Museum and Memorial.</p>
      <p>In 2014, Sherman was inducted into the inaugural class of the University of Missouri's Bloch School of Business Entrepreneurs Hall of Fame with a group that included Kauffman and Lamar Hunt, the late founder of the American Football League (AFL) and former owner of the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
