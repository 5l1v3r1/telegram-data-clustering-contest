        <b>Juan Cuadrado has followed Leonardo Bonucci in committing his future to Juventus by penning a new deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Winger Juan Cuadrado has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract extension at Juventus, the Serie A champions have confirmed.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old Colombia international joined Juve initially in August 2015, in the first of two consecutive season-long loans from Chelsea.</p>
      <p>A permanent €20million switch was finally secured ahead of the 2017-18 season.</p>
      <p>Cuadrado has won the Scudetto in each of his four seasons in Serie A, along with three Coppas Italia and a Supercoppa Italiana.</p>

      <p>The former Fiorentina man has 15 goals and 28 assists in Juve colours, although he has generally been more concerned with defensive duties this season.</p>
      <p>Injury problems forced Maurizio Sarri to field Cuadrado as a full-back, and the majority of his 14 appearances in all competitions this term have come on the right-hand side of defence.</p>
      <p>Cuadrado is the second senior member of Juventus’ squad to pen fresh terms this week after Italy centre-back Leonardo Bonucci renewed until June 2024.</p>
