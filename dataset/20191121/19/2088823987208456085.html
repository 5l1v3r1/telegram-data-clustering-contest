      <p>Denver Broncos All-Pro pass rusher Von Miller did a good job talking up Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen in advance of Sunday’s game at New Era Field.</p>
      <p>Miller put Allen in elite company — for an unexpected trait — on a conference call with Buffalo-area media Thursday.</p>
      <p>“He can escape the pocket, and it’s a challenge to get him down in the open field,” Miller said. “He’s 6-7. He’s got a mean stiff arm like Bo Jackson.”</p>
      <p>That line apparently caused someone on Miller’s end of the line to chuckle, which caused Miller to laugh.</p>
      <p>“He does, though — he’s got a stiff arm like Bo Jackson,” Miller insisted. “Whenever you get in the open field, you’ve gotta bring the heavy luggage and bring him down.”</p>
      <p>The Bills will try their best to keep Miller from bringing his luggage too close to Allen on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Miller, a seven-time Pro Bowler, has 103 sacks in nine NFL seasons. He has five sacks this year. He has had seven straight seasons of 10 or more sacks. Miller ranks third in NFL history in sacks per game among players with at least 100 games.</p>
      <p>Miller will be a huge challenge for Bills rookie right tackle Cody Ford. Miller has played about 75% of his snaps this year across from right tackle and 25% across from left tackle.</p>
      <p>“It’s the league,” Miller said of going against a rookie. “Everybody can play. Everybody’s been the man at some point or another. It doesn’t matter if you’re second string or third string, if you make it here in the NFL you can play. I’m expecting him to play. I’m expecting great play out of all those guys. And dealing with a quarterback like Josh Allen, you don’t really need much help from the offensive line.</p>
      <p>“He’s a great quarterback, big, tall, strong, fast, runs the ball,” Miller said. “He’s the future of great quarterbacks for this league.”</p>

      <p>Miller’s last visit to Buffalo, in 2017, was memorable in part because he got an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the fourth quarter for offering his hand to pick Tyrod Taylor off the ground, then pulling it back. It was a joke. But the officials did not have a sense of humor about it.</p>
      <p>“We were talking about that earlier in the week, the last time I was in Buffalo,” Miller said. “It wasn’t too funny during the game. But looking back on it, it was pretty funny.”</p>
      <p>The Bills almost had a chance to draft Miller in 2011. He went to Denver with the second overall pick. The Bills took Marcell Dareus with the third pick.</p>
      <p>Did Miller ever think he might get picked by the Bills at No. 3 that year?</p>
      <p>“Man, hell no, I didn’t want to go to Buffalo,” Miller said with a laugh. “I didn’t want to go to Buffalo. I wanted to be a Denver Bronco from Day One, and that’s where I’m at. There was a little chance. They took Marcell. I thought for a little bit I was going to Buffalo. Now I know a little bit about the fans, how Bills Mafia is, about all the legends. ... But I’m happy to be a Denver Bronco.”</p>
