      </p>
      <p>A Twitter user recently gave a lot of social media users some food for thought about parenting. The lady who goes under the Twitter handle, @neauxna, stated that parents need to understand that their kids don't belong to them.</p>
      <p>According to her, rather than focus on living through their kids, parents should focus on helping them become the best version of themselves.</p>
      <p>She wrote: <i>"Your children don’t belong to you. You’re on borrowed time with them. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a better human being; not to build a mini version of you and all your deflated hopes and dreams. Help them become the best them not the best you."</i></p>
