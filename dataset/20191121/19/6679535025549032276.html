      <h1>Varsity extends conditional affiliation of Ambedkar Institute</h1>
      <h2>The decision follows Andaman &amp; Nicobar administration satisfying a set of conditions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:29:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Pondicherry Central University has accorded conditional affiliation to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Institute of Technology, Port Blair, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, to offer the existing 3 B. Tech. courses (2019-20).</p>
      <p>According to a press note from the university, the provisional affiliation has been granted on satisfying a set of conditions that includes the Andaman &amp; Nicobar administration constituting a three-member enquiry committee with two university nominees on the functioning of the college and the faculty complaints against the present principal and submitting a report within eight weeks.</p>
      <h3>Stipulations</h3>
      <p>The university also stipulates that sharing of space, faculty and facilities of the Engineering College with the Polytechnic College should not be permitted as per the AICTE instructions; a qualified principal as per AICTE norms be appointed within three months and the Board of Governors (BOG) of the college reconstituted as per the AICTE norms and including two university nominees who are to be invited with due notice to all meetings.</p>
      <p>The university states that all other deficiencies pointed out by the Inspection Committee of the University with respect to faculty, lab equipment, library books and journals and sports facilities should be rectified within three months.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the university had not granted affiliation for this institute due to various deficiencies that were detected during inspection. The Engineering College was functioning in the same premises of a Polytechnic College.</p>
      <p>The faculty of the Polytechnic College were made to take classes for B. Tech. students keeping away the UPSC posted qualified teachers exclusively for engineering courses.</p>
      <p>The college had no engineering workshops and was using only polytechnic college resources.</p>
      <p>Even the classrooms were used for both engineering and polytechnic classes.</p>
      <p>The inspection also found that project work guidance and supervision were not allotted to the UPSC selected qualified engineering college teachers.</p>
      <h3>Eligibility challenged</h3>
      <p>In spite of repeated instructions from the university, the Principal of Polytechnic College was allowed to continue as Principal of Engineering College when his eligibility and qualifications were challenged in a court of law.</p>
      <p>The university said due to the lack of quality teaching, the pass percentage of students in every semester was very low.</p>
      <p>The college had also not taken any steps to provide a remedial coaching to enable students to clear their backlogs.</p>
      <p>The university said it had also been brought to its notice that there was a constant unrest in the college as the faculty were harassed by extending their probation, giving memos and denying permission for their legitimate travels for attending conferences and seminars.</p>
      <p>In the light of the above deficiencies, the university was compelled to withhold the affiliation for the current academic year.</p>
      <p>However, realising the need for technical education for the island students who have no other alternatives to pursue their higher studies, the university has reconsidered the issue and accorded conditional provisional affiliation for the current academic year 2019-20 in the interest of the students alone, the press note said.</p>
