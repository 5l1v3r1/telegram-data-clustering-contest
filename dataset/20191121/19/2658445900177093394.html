      <p>A medical doctor, Olusegun Bankole, on Thursday told an Ikeja Special Offences Court that a 33-year-old driver, Francis Apai, raped his employer’s teenage daughter.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Bankole, who works at the Alimosho General Hospital in Lagos, testified at the trial of Apai for sexual assault.</p>
      <p>Led in evidence by prosecution counsel, Ms M. I. Oshodi, Bankole said that on Nov. 19, 2014, the day of the alleged assault, the 18-year-old complainant (name withheld) was accompanied into the emergency ward of the hospital by a group of people.</p>
      <p>“She was said to have been raped by an adult male who she later identified as her parent’s driver.</p>
      <p>“The history we got is that the man forcefully dragged her into a room and choked her in the neck with his hands.</p>
      <p>“He overpowered her while she was struggling with him, and penetrated her vagina with his penis,” he said.</p>
      <p>The doctor said that he made the findings when he examined the complainant.</p>
      <p>” We found a young girl with multiple bruises around her neck and around her two hands.</p>
      <p>“We did a vaginal examination in her and it revealed that she had normal female genitalia with multiple bruises around her vulva and a freshly broken hymen,” he said.</p>
      <p>The witness said that the complainant underwent some medical examinations and treatments to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
      <p>Bankole testified that on request, he issued a medical report on the alleged victim to the police.</p>

      <p>While being cross-examined by defence counsel, Mr Qudus Mumuni, the doctor said that based on the complainant’s history and physical examination, her hymen was ruptured by a penis.</p>
      <p>He also said that his name and signature was on the medical report and that he did not see the defendant when the complainant was brought to the hospital.</p>
      <p>According to the prosecution, Apai committed the offence on Nov. 19, 2014, in the complainant’s home in Lagos.</p>
      <p>“The alleged offence contravenes Section 259 of the Criminal Law of Lagos, 2011,” Oshodi said.</p>
      <p>Justice Sherifat Solebo adjourned the case to Jan. 7 for continuation of trial.</p>
