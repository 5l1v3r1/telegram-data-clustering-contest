      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers latest - Nuno Espirito Santo's men are back in action this Saturday against Bournemouth following the international break</h2>

      <p>AFC Bournemouth appear to have suffered a key injury blow ahead of their clash with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/bournemouth-fc">The Cherries</a> and Wolves go head-to-head on the South Coast on Saturday with the two sides sitting side-by-side in the table, separated by a solitary goal.</p>
      <p>The clash should prove evenly-matched, but Wolves' chances of picking up a valuable away three points may have been boosted.</p>
      <p>That's because reports claim Bournemouth's starting striker Joshua King has suffered a hamstring injury.</p>

      <p>King was described as 'a little sore' by local media after exiting Norway's Euro 2020 qualifier against Malta with just one minute left on the clock.</p>
      <p>The former Manchester United frontman scored the opener as Norway won 2-1, but they failed to achieve automatic qualification, finishing third.</p>
      <p>King has scored three times for Bournemouth this season, including a winner against former club United.</p>
      <p>If reports are true and he has suffered a hamstring injury, he may not be able to inflict the same level of damage on Wolves this weekend.</p>
