      <p>In a late night meeting, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and his MLA-son Aaditya Thackeray met NCP president Sharad Pawar in Mumbai on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The crucial meeting took place at Sharad Pawar's residence Silver Oak in South Mumbai. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and NCP leader Ajit Pawar were also present during the meet.</p>
      <p>The Thackerays called on Sharad Pawar, a Rajya Sabha MP, after he arrived in Mumbai from New Delhi in the evening.</p>
      <p>This late night meet took place on a day when senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said in New Delhi that his party and the NCP have "complete unanimity" on all issues concerning government formation in Maharashtra. They will now hold talks with the Shiv Sena to "finalise the architecture of the alliance" on Friday.</p>
      <p>Prithviraj Chavan also said that the final decision on Congress supporting Shiv Sena to form the government in Maharashtra would take place on Friday. A meeting would be held with the Shiv Sena on Friday, after which, a decision would be announced, he said.</p>
      <p>Sources said the three parties -- Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP -- are likely to make a formal announcement on Friday about joining hands to take a shot at power in the state.</p>
      <p>Sources also said the Congress and the NCP both have demanded that Uddhav Thackeray should be the chief minister.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile on Friday, Uddhav Thackeray is likely to address a meeting of party MLAs and senior leaders which is expected to deliberate on the party's line of action in the backdrop of the three main non-BJP parties making efforts to form government in Maharashtra, a party leader said.</p>
