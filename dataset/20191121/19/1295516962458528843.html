      <h1>Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker Director on Snoke's Death - 'It Made Me Laugh'</h1>

      <p>The <i>Star Wars</i> sequel trilogy began with what seemed to be a new dark lord in the form of Supreme Leader Snoke. However, before anyone knew who he really was or where he came from, Kylo Ren slew him in <i>The Last Jedi</i>, just one of numerous twists that continues to divide the fandom. Now J.J Abrams, director of the upcoming <a href="http://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a>, has revealed his reaction to the scene.</p>
      <p>Unlike the audience, Abrams -- being an integral part of the current trilogy -- knew from the beginning that it was going to happen and it seems that he was amused by it. "When I read his first draft, it made me laugh," Abrams stated, "I saw that was his take and his voice." The director then went on to express his appreciation for many of the creative decisions that Johnson made with his entry in the franchise. "I appreciated the choices he made as a filmmaker that would probably be very different from the choices that I would have made," Abrams stated.</p>

      <p>Since the release of <i>The Last Jedi</i> back in 2017, fans have theorized that Johnson's decision to remove Snoke from the plot may have disrupted the larger plan Abrams had in mind for the trilogy. In his most recent interview, Abrams seemed to clarify that this was simply not the case.</p>
      <p>Serving to accomplish more than just subverting expectations, the death of Snoke logically suits the story, considering the fact that Palpatine is set to return in some form or another in <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>. This -- as Abrams has previously explained -- will help to tie the entire nine-film "Skywalker Saga" together. With Snoke out of the way, the Emperor, who has been the primary antagonist for the majority of the saga, can once again receive as much focus as he as a character deserves.</p>
      <p>Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams and Carrie Fisher, with Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant. The film arrives December 20.</p>
