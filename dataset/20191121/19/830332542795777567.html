      <h1>NYPD cops learned they're cousins</h1>
      <h2>They'd been partners for six months</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - These<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/us/new-york-police-department-suicides/index.html"> NYPD officers</a> are partners at work, but they recently found out their connection goes <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/police-officer-surprise-birthday-party-btc/index.html">beyond the call of duty</a> -- they're also cousins.</p>
      <p>Officers Harley Greco and Tyler Barbour are both officers in the NYPD 19th Precinct, and they've been partners for about six months, according to<a href="https://pix11.com/2019/11/19/nypd-partners-took-a-dna-test-turns-out-theyre-100-cousins/"> CNN affiliate WPIX</a>. They've always gotten along well, Greco told WPIX, but they didn't know their connection went any deeper.</p>
      <p>Now, that's all changed.</p>
      <p>They weren't the ones that discovered their familial connection -- that was made by family members, in the comment section of the precinct's Facebook page, of all places.</p>
      <p>Their relatives -- Greco's grandmother and Barbour's first cousin -- had already known they were related, after taking a DNA test earlier this year. When chatting in the comments on Facebook, they realized they both had family working in the 19th precinct.</p>
      <p>"My grandmother called me and said, 'Do you know a Tyler Barbour?' and I said 'Yeah, I just went to his wedding -- that's my partner,'" Greco told WPIX. "And she said 'Well, that's also your cousin.'"</p>
      <p>Greco called the discovery "bizarre," but not surprising because of how well the two get along. And not much is changing -- they'll still have each other's back, he told WPIX.</p>
      <p>They're having some fun with it, too. They've now dubbed their squad car the "cuz car," Barbour told WPIX.</p>
      <p>And they're not wasting any time with their newfound family. The two will be getting together this year for Thanksgiving, surely throwing in a "thank you" to DNA tests and social media.</p>
