      <h1>KSEB files plaint against telecom major</h1>
      <h2>Alleged safety norm violations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:21:05+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has lodged a complaint with the North police against the work being carried out by a telecom major allegedly in violation of safety norms.</p>
      <p>KSEB had issued a stop memo to officials of a private telecom major on October 17, directing them to suspend the installation of iron posts for drawing optical fibre cable after it was noticed that the work was being carried out allegedly in violation of norms.</p>
      <p>“The work was suspended for a day after the stop memo was issued only to resume soon thereafter. Following this, a letter was shot off to the construction in-charge of the company, stating that work should be carried out only in accordance with the safety regulations prescribed by the Central Electricity Authority, failing which the company will be held responsible for any damage to KSEB properties or accidents thereof,” said Sajeev Kumar, assistant engineer (AE), Kaloor electrical section, KSEB.</p>
      <p>A copy of the letter was sent to the Kochi Corporation Secretary and chief safety commissioner, KSEB, among others.</p>
      <p>He alleged that even the letter did not have the desired effect following which he lodged a police complaint. Mr. Kumar said though the corporation had granted the company permission to carry out the work, it was subjected to requisite permissions from KSEB, Kerala Water Authority, and BSNL.</p>
      <p>“Almost all roads in the city have high-tension and low-tension underground cables, and digging pits to install iron posts without using power cable scanner could lead to accidents due to electric shock. Though no accident or damage has occurred till now owing to the work, there is a greater probability for them if the work continues in violation of safety norms,” said Mr. Kumar.</p>
      <h3>‘AEs intimated’</h3>
      <p>A representative of the telecom company, however, claimed that the work was being carried out after surveys and intimating the AEs concerned in advance.</p>
      <p>When asked about the complaint, North police sources said there was little role for the police in an offence which was civil in nature.</p>
      <p>“The better option will be to bring the matter to the attention of the corporation authorities and get them to suspend the sanction issued by the them to the telecom company,” an officer said.</p>
