      <h1>Man City defender seen as ‘perfect profile’ for rejuvenated squad – ‘Long contract could help’</h1>

      <p>With just three natural centre-backs at Pep Guardiola’s disposal at Manchester City, we doubt they are in the business of selling in that position in the near future.</p>
      <p>However, that doesn’t stop the Italian press from speculating they could, as Calciomercato.it use the excuse of a meeting between Milan’s Chief Football Officer, Zvonimir Boban, and Jorge Mendes to send Nicolás Otamendi to Italy.</p>
      <p>While they have no actual information of what was discussed between the two men, they do speculate that ‘a name that could have ended up on the discussion table’ is the Argentine’s.</p>
      <p>They recall the Manchester City defender was approached by the Italians this summer, and he would represent the ‘perfect profile’ for a rejuvenated Milan in search of experience.</p>
      <p>There are problems to all this, though, especially when it comes to the player’s wages, although they reckon a ‘long contract could help’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/357290/calciomercato_milan_sbarca_mendes_scambio_con_kessie">Calciomercato.it</a> do acknowledge this is all an idea, but we felt the need to cover it because you know someone, somewhere, will twist this into something it isn’t, and the snowball effect could spread very quickly.</p>
