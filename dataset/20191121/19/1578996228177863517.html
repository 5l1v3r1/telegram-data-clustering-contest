      <p>"I have not stopped thinking about these pants since I first saw them at LFW in February. They're weird and I don't need them, but isn't that what sales are for? An anxiety attack triggered by things you absolutely must have because they might sell out and the fear of regret sends you down a hole and suddenly you're rocking back and forth, credit card in hand. <i>But it's Burberry."</i>— Justine Carreon, Senior Market Editor</p>

      <p>"Try as I might, I cannot get over the hair clip trend! It's fun and easy and makes me feel like I'm back in the first grade, asking my dad to put matching barrettes in my hair before school. (True story.) I'd love to wear this oversized faux pearl clip with a leather jacket and combat boots."— Madison Feller, News Editor</p>

      <p>"My day-to-day wardrobe is all black, all the time, but for special occasions I'll venture into more colorful territory. Lately I've been loving full-coverage silhouettes and wallpaper prints—a <i>very</i> dangerous combination if not executed correctly. Ganni always strikes the perfect balance. This dress will be my artful approach to festive attire for the holiday season."— Katie Connor, Digital Director </p>

      <p>"'Oh no,' I sighed, as soon as I saw the black neoprene sack dress by The Row. It has exactly the weird kind of sleeves I like, and is sure to hide any and all food babies that might develop after eating too much bread. 'I’m going to buy that aren’t I?' I sighed as I noted the price ($425, marked down from $850!). Add to cart."— Jessica Roy, Deputy Editor</p>

      <p>"I'm on the hunt for boots that make me feel like Rihanna and this Alexandre Vauthier pair is the perfect amount of Bad Gal meets wearable for IRL. (Let's face it, we're not all Rih!) I can see myself wearing this under a long skirt for the office ('Bitch Better Have My Money'), and then paired with a short dress for after hours ('S&amp;M')."— Ariana Yaptangco, Social Media Editor</p>

      <p>"Spring may feel a long way away right now, but it still rains in fall, and this lilac trench has me wistful for the upcoming warm, rainy days once this winter is done with. This is a good staple piece for 2020 and something I know I’ll wear a lot, so $85 seems like a bargain. And it’s very me with its feminine silhouette and pretty pastel shade."— Alyssa Bailey, News &amp; Strategy Editor</p>

      <p>"A fact that I’ve recently accepted is that I will never own enough tan coats. In the camel oasis that has recently become my winter closet, there always seems to be room for one more. The dress-appropriate length, impeccable tailoring and soft cashmere of this Bottega coat puts it into a category of its own. Perfect for a night out or for a dressed-up day at the office, it’s a more streamlined update on the traditional camel wrap coat that will last for seasons to come."— Mia Feitel, Art Director </p>
