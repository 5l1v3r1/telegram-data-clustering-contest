      <p>SOUTH AFRICAN FRANCO Smith will be at the helm for Italy through the 2020 Six Nations, but the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) will continue its search for a permanent successor to Conor O’Shea.</p>
      <p>O’Shea stepped down last week after over three years in the role following their World Cup campaign in a pool that included New Zealand and eventual winners South Africa.</p>
      <p>Wins over Namibia and Canada gave them some cause for cheer, although Italy were denied a meeting with the All Blacks – and therefore any shot at qualifying for the knockout stage – by the devastation wrought by Typhoon Hagibis. </p>
      <p>The FIR today said that Smith, Giampiero De Carli and Marius Goosen would lead the coaching ticket for the Six Nations, with a permanent staff installed in the summer for the lead up to the 2023 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Smith, who has coached the Cheetahs and Treviso, will be out to avoid a fifth consecutive wooden spoon for Italy at the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>A new coach is expected to be appointed by July 1.</p>
