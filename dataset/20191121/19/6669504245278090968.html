      <p>Barriere RCMP have arrested a woman after she was found breaching her probation order earlier this month.</p>
      <p>RCMP say on Nov. 13, they received information that 48-year-old Bridgette Poore of Kamloops had returned to the community of Barriere after she had been barred from being 10-kilometres of the district due to a court-imposed probation order.</p>
      <p>Police say the order was issued in August following multiple convictions of offences committed in the Barriere area, according to a news release.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 14, police from Barriere and the RCMP Central Interior Traffic Services attended to an address along Yard Road where investigators believed Poore was inside.</p>
      <p>“Our officers surrounded and contained the home after she refused to exit,” Barriere RCMP Cpl. Rob Welsman says in a release. “Entry was made into the residence after officers obtained a judicial authorization from the court. Mrs. Poore was taken into police custody without further incident and transported to Kamloops Provincial Court to appear before a judge.”</p>
      <p>Poore has now been formally charged with one count of breach of probation and she has since been remanded into custody.</p>
      <p>Her next court date is set for Nov. 25.</p>
