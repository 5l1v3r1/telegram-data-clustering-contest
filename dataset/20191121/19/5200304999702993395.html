      <p>After much furore about his return to the Sony Entertainment Television series, ‘Indian Idol’, musician Anu Malik has stepped down from his role as judge.</p>
      <p>Malik had been under huge pressure to resign after he was accused of sexual allegations by a number of singers including Sona Mohapatra, Neha Bhasin and Shweta Pandit. Malik walked away from the series half-way last year due to the claims. However, his position was reinstated this year.</p>
      <p>Mohapatra had regularly campaigned for him to leave the show. Upon hearing the news today, Mohapatra branded the decision, a “symbolic victory”. She added, “It’s great news. Sony TV took a long time to do this but I am happy that he has finally stepped down from the show. It’s a battle of the whole country. There are so many people who did not want to see this person (Anu Malik) flaunting himself on national television because it gives a lot of wrong messages to predators that they can also get away with such a thing.”</p>
      <p>She said, “I was fighting for fairness and justice. Now, after hearing this news, I think it is a victory for everybody – not just me but also for all other women who were badly treated by him. It is a symbolic victory. Our fight is not over yet, it’s just a start. We are not going to sit here and let people to take us for granted.”</p>
