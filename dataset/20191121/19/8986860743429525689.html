      <p>Ghanaian hiplife musician Justice Kwaku Amoamo popularly known as Patapaa has finally spoken after he collapsed on stage few minutes to a show in Tarkwa.</p>
      <p>According to the “One Corner” hitmaker, he nearly passed away because he was poisoned by a friend.</p>
      <p>The Swedru-based musician revealed that he requested for an energy drink before going on stage but later had a serious stomach upset where he was rushed to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Patapaa explained that he was in a critical condition but was saved by God. He also added that he worked towards Eagle Prophet’s death prophecy on his life.</p>
      <p><i>“I was poisoned when I went for a show at Tarkwa where I asked for an energy drink. My vomit was as dark as a polythene bag and my stool was black and filled with blood”</i>, Patapaa revealed.</p>
      <p>It could be recalled that the General Overseer of God’s Crown Chapel Reindolph Oduro Gyebi popularly known as Eagle Prophet recently revealed that Patapaa would be poisoned by his very close friend.</p>
      <p>Patapaa has however confirmed Eagle Prophet’s prophecy explaining how he nearly lost his life after his friend tried to poison him.</p>
