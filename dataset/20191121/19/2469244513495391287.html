      <p>A £4,000 donation has brought the total Masonic support for air ambulances across the country past the £2.4million mark.</p>
      <p>The Devon Air Ambulance received the grant from Devonshire Freemasons. The total contribution to the Devon Air Ambulance since 2007 by Devonshire Freemasons is in excess of £122,000.</p>
      <p>Devon’s Air Ambulances operates across Devon up to 19 hours a day and assisted 1109 patients during 2018.</p>
      <p>The grant, which comes through the Masonic Charitable Foundation, is funded by Freemasons and their families from across Devon, England and Wales.</p>
      <p>During 2019, Freemasons from around the country will be presenting 20 regional air ambulances with grants totalling £180,000.</p>
      <p>Tracy Owen, fundraising manager at the Devon Air Ambulance, said: “We would like to thank all of the Devonshire Freemasons lodges for their ongoing support. Donations from them truly do make a huge difference in keeping Devon’s two Air Ambulances flying.”</p>
      <p>Dr Reuben Ayres Provincial Grand Charity Steward of the Devonshire Freemasons when meeting Tracy and Adrian Parker, their Patient Liason Officer said: “We are proud to be able to support the Devon Air Ambulance. Thanks to the tireless efforts of their doctors and aircrew, many lives of local people are saved every year.”</p>
      <p>Devon Air Ambulance relies entirely on charitable grants and donations. To make a donation, visit info@daat.org or 01392-466666.</p>
