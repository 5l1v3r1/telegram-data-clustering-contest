      <h1>Get an Intel Core i5-9600K for just $195 right now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:53:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>The Intel Core i5-9600K is a little over a year old at this point, but it's still one of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-cpu-for-gaming/">best gaming CPUs</a> you can buy, especially since it has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/intels-core-i5-9600k-is-now-just-dollar215-at-newegg/">continued to fall in price</a> over the past few months. Now you can grab one from Newegg's eBay store for just $194.99, a savings of $85 from the original price.</p>
      <p>This CPU is part of the Coffee Lake family, with 6 cores/6 threads (no Hyper-Threading), a base clock of 3.6GHz, a boost clock of 4.6GHz, and Intel UHD Graphics 630 built-in. It can support up to 128GB of 2666MHz DDR RAM on two channels, and up to 16 PCIe lanes.</p>
      <p>Of course, you'll need to pair it with a FCLGA1151-socket motherboard. Check out our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-motherboards/">best gaming motherboards</a> roundup for some recommendations, if you don't already have a compatible board. Since this is a K-series part, you'll also need a cooler, so check our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-cpu-coolers/">best CPU coolers</a> for options.</p>
