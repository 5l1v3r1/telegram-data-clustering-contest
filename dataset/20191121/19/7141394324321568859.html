      <h1>Fed Chair Powell Issues Written Response on the US Dollar and the Digital Currency Race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:29:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has responded to lawmakers who have urged him to consider issuing a digital US dollar.</p>
      <p>In a letter to Congress this week, Powell appears to weigh the pros and cons. He says he is both exploring the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), although the Fed is not currently developing a CBDC, while also stating that he does not see the distinct advantages such a currency would have in the United States.</p>
      <p>Two US Congressmen, French Hill and Bill Foster, wrote a letter in September <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/10/02/us-congressmen-urge-the-fed-to-consider-creating-a-national-digital-currency-as-the-rise-of-crypto-threatens-paper-money/">urging the Fed</a> to consider creating a national digital currency as the rise of crypto and projects like Facebook’s Libra threaten paper money.</p>
      <p>They join a chorus of policymakers, including Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/10/03/us-banker-calls-digital-currency-from-us-federal-reserve-bank-inevitable/">Patrick Harker</a>; former Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, J. Christopher Giancarlo, (CFTC); and former Chief Innovation Officer of the CFTC, Daniel Gorfine, who believe that the US government needs to consider a digital dollar – or risk getting left behind.</p>
      <p>Writes Powell,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The Federal Reserve is not currently developing a U.S. dollar central bank digital currency (CBDC), but continues to carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of issuing a general purpose CBDC, defined as a new type of Federal Reserve liability that could be held directly by households and businesses.”</i>
