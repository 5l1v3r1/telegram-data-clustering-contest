      <p>The Crime Branch (CB) probing the incident involving firing at a beauty parlour at Panampilly Nagar has submitted a report to the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court (Economic Offences), Ernakulam, arraigning two more persons as accused.</p>
      <p>Ajas and Monayi were the ones newly arraigned in as accused in addition to the four, including gangster Ravi Pujari who was reportedly arrested in Senegal last year. He already stands accused in the case. The firing allegedly targeting the beauty parlour of actor Leena Maria Paul took place last December. The CB had filed the report before the court last week.</p>
      <p>According to CB sources, Ajas was the alleged link-up between Ravi Pujari and Bilal of Kombara in Aluva NAD and Vipin Varghese of Thevara, who actually carried out the firing. Monayi allegedly arranged the firearm. Both of them are absconding and are suspected to be in Dubai, sources said.</p>
      <p>Both the assailants who carried out the firing were arrested along with Althaf of Elamakkara who allegedly arranged the motorcycle used by them and handed out the firearm collected from Monayi to the assailants. All the three are now out on bail.</p>
      <p>The alleged involvement of Ravi Pujari came to light after the assailants left behind a piece of paper bearing his name. Later, Ms. Paul alleged that she had received calls from the gangster, demanding ransom before the firing.</p>
      <p>“We had filed separate chargesheet against Ravi Pujari to speed up his extradition. We have handed over documents for his extradition to the legal division of the Ministry of External Affairs,” CB sources said.</p>
      <p>All the accused stand charged with conspiracy, while some of them face charges of extortion threats and charges under the Arms Act.</p>
