      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin wildlife officials say hunters killed 10 elk in Wisconsin's second elk season.</p>
      <p>The Department of Natural Resources set a 10-bull limit for the season, which ran from Oct. 12 to Nov. 10 in Ashland, Bayfield, Price and Sawyer counties.</p>
      <p>The department says hunters authorized by the state killed five bulls. Ojibwe tribal hunters killed five.</p>
      <p>More than 23,000 Wisconsin residents submitted a $10 application in hopes of winning one of four state tags in a drawing. About 2,500 more bought a ticket in hopes of winning the fifth tag in a Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation raffle.<br/>   Seven dollars from every application fee as well as raffle proceeds will go to elk management and research in Wisconsin.<br/>   The 2020 elk hunt application period is expected to run from March 1 through May 31.</p>
