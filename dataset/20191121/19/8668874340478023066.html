      <p>A former leader in Australian media has called for a complete cleanout of Rugby Australia, calling for Raelene Castle to follow the lead of departing chairman Cameron Clyne.</p>
      <p>David Leckie, the former chief executive of the Seven Media Group, didn’t pull any punches in his assessment of the sport’s national body, with a particular focus on Castle.</p>
      <p>“We have to get rid of the entire board and start again,” Leckie told the Australian. “There’s not a single person on it who deserves to remain there.</p>
      <p>“Raelene has been a total disaster. She doesn’t know rugby, she doesn’t know <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> and, judging by her time at Canterbury (Bulldogs), she doesn’t know how to manage a salary cap.</p>
      <p>“She buggered that club. Central to your role when you’re the general manager of a club, is salary cap. That’s your first, first and first priority.”</p>

      <p>Leckie’s comments come a day after rugby Australia announced the signing of Kiwi Dave Rennie as the next Wallabies coach, following the departure of Michael Cheika after the Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>Cheika stood down from his post as Wallabies coach after five rough seasons in which the Wallabies won just 34 of his 68 games in charge.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Radio Sport’s D’Arcy Waldegrave on Wednesday, Castle said Rennie’s signing was an exciting one for the organization.</p>
      <p>“He was by far and away the most outstanding candidate,” Castle said.</p>

      <p>“We believed he was the best fit not only from a performance coaching point of view but also a cultural point of view and his experience in bringing groups of people together is very sound.</p>
      <p>“Dave’s proven ability both at the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> and what he’s done in a short time with the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> Warriors to bring together a group of men and build a culture where they all want to work together toward the same thing is one of his best skill sets and that’s something we know will be very valuable to us.</p>
      <p>“We had a plan and we worked really hard to execute it.”</p>
