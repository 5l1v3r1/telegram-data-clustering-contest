      <h1>Half-Life: Alyx trailer drops – it’s coming out in March 2020</h1>

      <p>Half-Life: Alyx has just been revealed in a sensational new trailer, with the first Half-Life game in well over a decade (and Valve’s first flagship VR exclusive) set to release in March 2020 for Valve Index, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality.</p>

      <p>The game is set somewhere between Half-Life and Half-Life 2, so it’s not a continuation from the cliffhanger ending to Half-Life 2: Episode 2. It features Alyx Vance and her father Eli as they kickstart the resistance to the Combine’s occupation of Earth.</p>
      <p>You play as Alyx through the narrative action adventure, with some stunning looking world interactions, puzzle solving, exploration and some realistic combat, where you can lean around combat, rummage through shelves for ammo, and more.</p>
      <p>Built in the Source 2 engine, the graphics look incredible for a VR game – no doubt helped by being able to throw the resources of a gaming PC at it – and Valve look to be making full use of the Knuckles controllers of the Valve Index, with finger tracking on show at multiple points in the trailer. However, the game is compatible with all PC VR systems, resorting back to grip and trigger buttons on Vive, Rift and WMR. You can play room scale, sitting or standing, you have teleport, shift and full analogue motion, and so on.</p>
      <p>It will be free to anyone who has a Valve Index, regardless of when you buy one, but if you do so before the end of 2019 you a few additional bonuses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explore environments from Half-Life: Alyx in your SteamVR Home space</li>
        <li>Alternate gun skins to embellish Alyx’s arsenal</li>
        <li>Special Half-Life: Alyx-themed content for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It looks truly impressive, and I can’t wait to see more.</p>
