      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> campaign is taking aim at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/adam-schiff">House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.,</a> with new merchandise designed to disparage his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> with a pun on his name.</p>
      <p>Released on Thursday, the "Bull-Schiff" T-shirts show the word "bull" alongside a caricature of Schiff with an extended neck -- an apparent reference to Trump calling him a "pencil neck."</p>

      <p>"Our bull-schiff-o-meter is off the charts!" the <a href="https://shop.donaldjtrump.com/products/bull-schiff-tee">Trump campaign</a> tweeted. "Shifty-Schiff pushed the FAKE Russian collusion story for three years and now he’s on to another sham. Don’t let Adam Schiff get away with the bull-Schiff Ukrainian investigation." Sizes range from small to 3XL.</p>
      <p>The new shirts were made available as Schiff led the fifth day of public hearings in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, focusing on activities surrounding President Trump's July 25 call with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukraine.</a></p>

      <p>Trump has repeatedly denounced Schiff, who helped lead both the Ukraine inquiry and the House intelligence committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Trump blasted Schiff as a "corrupt politician," telling reporters the congressman "stands up and he tells lies all day long ... We have no due process."</p>

      <p>On Thursday, Trump directly attacked the congressman on Twitter. "No pressure on Ukraine," he said, referring to allegations of a quid pro quo. "Great corruption &amp; dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!"</p>

      <p>Schiff has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/adam-schiff-impeachment-trump-bribery">accused</a> Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo in pushing for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter and Hunter's role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings. "[Trump's efforts] to help his reelection campaign was a basic quid pro quo," he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/adam-schiff-impeachment-trump-bribery">said.</a></p>
      <p>He added that Trump's actions were a "conditioning of official acts for something of great value to the president. These political investigations -- it goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery as well as other potential high crimes or misdemeanors."</p>
