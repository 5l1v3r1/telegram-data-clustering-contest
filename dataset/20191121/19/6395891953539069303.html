      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - House Democrats are urging the Supreme Court to lift its hold on their subpoena for President Donald Trump's financial records.</p>
      <p>The Democrats say in a filing Thursday that Trump's broad arguments that his financial records don't have to be turned over by his accountants lack merit.</p>
      <p>The House's plea to allow enforcement of its subpoena comes a few days after Chief Justice John Roberts imposed an indefinite delay to give the court time to figure out how to handle the case.</p>
      <p>A similar fight also has reached the high court from New York, where the Manhattan district attorney wants Trump's tax returns for a criminal investigation.</p>
      <p>The justices probably will decide by mid-January whether to hear the New York case, and might want to deal with the two cases together.</p>
