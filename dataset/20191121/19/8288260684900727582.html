      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:19:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:19</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>With the Christmas football period growing ever closer, fans hoping to tuck into a feast of Boxing Day football may have been frustrated to discover Amazon have the right to all 10 Premier League matches.</p>
      <p>Clashes such as Leicester City vs Liverpool and Wolves vs Manchester City will all be shown on Amazon this year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a>'s Boxing Day date with Norwich City at home will also be screened on the platform.</p>
      <p>They became the first streaming service to enter the Premier League rights market, claiming all ten fixtures on matchday 15 and 19, including the Boxing Day football.</p>
      <p>With supporters paying out for subscription services for Sky Sports and BT Sport already, another competitor in the market has only complicated matters for fans wanting the ultimate football package.</p>
      <p>However, you can watch all of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/amazon">Amazon</a> matches for free and we've got all the details on how to do so.</p>

      <h4>How can I watch the games for free?</h4>
      <p>If like most football fans, you're already forking out for Sky Sports and BT Sport, the last thing you need is an extra expense, especially around Christmas.</p>
      <p>No bother, as it stands, you can watch all of Amazon's fixtures for free by taking out their 30-day Amazon Prime trial.</p>
      <p>After the free trial expires, you will be charged £7.99, so make sure to set a reminder if you're not bothered about those next-day-delivery perks.</p>
      <p>Of course, if you time it right, you can start your trial before their first batch of matches start and cancel after Boxing Day when all the football has finished.</p>
      <h4>What presenters and pundits are on?</h4>
      <p>Whilst there is yet to be an official announcement on who will head Amazon’s Premier League coverage, there have been some star-studded names linked.</p>
      <p>Gabby Logan could be in line to anchor as Amazon’s main presenter, with former footballers such as Peter Crouch and comedian John Bishop also linked.</p>
      <p>To add the X-factor, former Arsenal striker and new Montreal Impact manager Thierry Henry could join the panel.</p>

      <h4>How can I watch on Amazon Prime?</h4>
      <p>The beauty of an online streaming service is that there are multiple ways to watch Amazon Prime and not miss a kick of the action.</p>
      <p>You can stream Amazon through any tablet, laptop and most Smart TVs, all you need is a device that can connect to the internet.</p>
      <p>You can also watch Amazon Prime directly through your TV if you’re a Virgin TV customer with the use of the V6 TV set top box, however, this isn’t available via Freeview or through Sky or BT.</p>
