      <p><b>Singapore</b><b>:</b> A free trade agreement that takes effect on November 21 between the European Union and Singapore will put EU-based businesses closer to one of the world’s fastest-growing consumer markets. The deal is evidence that the EU is accelerating trade deals across Asia while the US withdrew from the now-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Efe news reported.</p>
      <p>“The EU does comprehensive, high standard deals that have some different rules from America’s FTAs so their active approach in Asia means their method to standards and rule-setting is becoming more common, whether it’s in the area of data privacy or geographic indicators, which will make it more difficult for American companies,” Tami Overby, senior director at consultancy McLarty Associates, told EFE.  The European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) is the first trade deal the 28-nation European bloc has reached in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>Under the deal, Singapore will remove tariffs on all EU products entering the city-state, while the EU will remove tariffs for 84 percent of Singaporean exports, and phase in the removal of the remainder over three to five years. The agreement promotes trade in sectors such as telecommunications, engineering, computing, maritime transport, and environmental services including green tech. (IANS)</p>
