      <p>The lightweight fight between Paddy Pimblett and former Ultimate Fighter competitor <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4501/joe-giannetti">Joe Giannetti</a> has been scrapped from Cage Warriors 111 just a day ahead of the event.</p>
      <p>The matchup fell apart after Giannetti failed to make weight, coming in at 163.7 pounds — 7.7 pounds over the lightweight limit for a non-title fight. For his part, Pimblett made weight at 154.9 pounds.</p>
      <p>Cage Warriors officials confirmed to MMA Fighting’s Peter Carroll that the fight was being pulled from the card taking place on Friday from London, England.</p>
      <p>It’s a disappointing end to what was a highly anticipated showdown between two lightweight prospects looking to make waves in this fight.</p>
      <p>Pimblett has been on the UFC’s radar for quite some time and he was hoping a win would secure another offer from the promotion to join the roster. Meanwhile, Giannetti was a part of The Ultimate Fighter season 27 making it all the way to the finals before falling to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4500/mike-trizano">Mike Trizano</a>.</p>
      <p>After Giannetti failed to make weight, he ended up in a heated exchange with Pimblett through a series of messages on Twitter. Giannetti claimed that he had already cut 25 pounds in 10 days after accepting the fight on short notice and he blasted Pimblett for not accepting a catchweight bout.</p>
      <p>“I missed weight today,” Giannetti wrote. “Their scale had me at 163 pounds. It’s not OK but I lost 25 pounds in the last 10 days for this opportunity, cut was going great, then my body just stopped sweating. Offered Paddy all my money and he threw a fit like and was talking sh8t like a [piece of sh*t].</p>
      <p>“Tried being super respectful to Paddy and his team and explaining it’s my fault, but it is short notice, I’ll give them whatever they want, after the way they responded, I must say they’re all trash.”</p>

      <p>Pimblett fired back as the two continued going back and forth over social media.</p>
      <p>“So what an eventful weigh in,” Pimblett said. “I step on the scales at 154.7 like a true pro my opponent then steps on the scales at 163.8 and then sits down and starts eating and drinking immediately didn’t even consider going in the sauna when if he [would have] got to 160 pounds all this could have been avoided.”</p>
