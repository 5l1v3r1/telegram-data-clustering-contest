      <h1>Ronan gets permission for extra floor in Tara Street development</h1>
      <h2>Dublin’s tallest building to have 23rd floor while remaining planned height of 88m</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:54:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/gordon-deegan-7.1837475" target="_blank">Gordon Deegan</a></address>
      <p>One of the country’s best-known developers, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Johnny+Ronan">Johnny Ronan</a>, has secured planning permission to add another floor on the tallest permitted building in Dublin.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Dublin+City+Council">Dublin City Council</a> gave the green light for the additional floor to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Tanat">Tanat</a> Ltd’s planned tower overlooking the Liffey at Tara Street which will extend the number of hotel rooms within the hotel component of the scheme from 107 to 157.</p>
      <p>The Tanat plan for the additional floor does not increase the overall 88m height of the building.</p>
      <p>The Ronan Group has commenced the required demolition works on site for the scheme and is aiming to complete the project by the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
      <p>The revised hotel layout will increase the overall floor area in the tower from 16,557sq m to 17,992sq m, comprising of 5,784sq m of hotel accommodation; 9,670sq m gross floor area of office accommodation and 361sq m gross floor area of restaurant accommodation.</p>
      <p>The number of floors will increase from 22 to 23 plus mezzanine level.</p>
      <h3>Slender design</h3>
      <p>A planning report lodged by the Ronan Group with the city council states that the slenderness and architectural design quality of the permitted development is maintained with the new plan.</p>
      <p>The report also states the proposed alterations are negligible in the overall design development of the scheme and will not impact on the quality of the public realm.</p>
      <p>The report states that the proposed building is a bespoke design and will significantly enhance the city economically and architecturally.</p>
      <p>The Tara Street tower is one of five large-scale projects the Ronan Group is constructing in the capital. The others are located at SalesforceTower; the 120,000sq ft Samuel Hotel at Spencer Place; a Spencer Place residential project of more than 500 units; and Facebook’s Ballsbridge office development.</p>
