      <h1>What’s your favorite Half-Life fan work?</h1>
      <h2>It’s a good day to do what has to be done by me</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:48:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/adi-robertson" target="_blank">Adi Robertson</a></address>
      <p>Okay, let’s acknowledge this: the <i>Half-Life </i>series was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18102541/half-life-20th-anniversary-retrospective-first-person-shooter-design">mechanically and narratively transformative</a> for the first-person shooter genre and gaming as a whole. Many among us loved the first two games, are still bitter about the loss of <i>Half-Life 3</i>, and are tentatively optimistic about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975423/half-life-alyx-vr-price-release-date-screenshots-trailer-valve-steam">the upcoming <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i></a>, the first full-length game in the series since 2004. But now that we’ve gotten those plaudits out of the way, let’s talk about <i>Half-Life</i>’s other glorious afterlife: the fan works.</p>
      <p><i>Half-Life 2 </i>was extraordinarily extensible. Its modding system was an accessible way to learn game design, and the popular <i>Garry’s Mod</i> let people pose and move characters to make videos and comics. <i>Half-Life</i> was moddable as well, and over time, fans have built everything from a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/">full-scale <i>Half-Life </i>remake</a> to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/94yf1x/halflife_mod_catlife/">first-person cat mod</a> (named, naturally, <i>Cat-Life</i>) to some crucial pieces of ‘00s internet humor. I’d love to hear other people’s favorite projects; these are three of mine.</p>
      <h3>Half-Life: Full Life Consequences</h3>
      <p><i>Full Life Consequences</i> was part of a whole genre of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic">deliberately awful fan fiction</a>, similar to <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Repercussions_of_Evil">the infamous</a> <i>Doom: Repercussions of Evil</i>. <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2945837/1/Halflife-Fulllife-Consequences">The</a> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2946082/1/Halflife-FullLife-Consequences-2-WhatHasTobeDone">four</a>-<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4869457/1/Halflife-Hero-Beggining">part</a> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4988255/1/Halflife-Fulllife-Consequences-Free-Man">series</a> follows John Freeman (Gordon Freeman’s hitherto unknown brother) on a gloriously nonsensical, creatively misspelled, and fourth-wall-breaking journey through the events of <i>Half-Life 2</i>. Because as John puts it, “its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys.”</p>
      <p>I can quote a frankly embarrassing amount of <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2945837/1/Halflife-Fulllife-Consequences">the first <i>Full Life Consequences</i> story</a> by heart, thanks to the excellent narrated dramatization seen below. Every time someone mentions <i>Half-Life 2</i>’s Ravenholm level, I have to resist whispering “<i>u shudnt come here</i>.”</p>

      <h3>Concerned: The Half-Life and Death of Gordon Frohman</h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.screencuisine.net/hlcomic/index.php?date=2005-05-01"><i>Concerned</i></a> was a more traditionally funny (and legitimately skillful) <i>Garry’s Mod</i> web comic, lampooning <i>Half-Life 2 </i>specifically and first-person shooter tropes in general. Its anti-hero is Gordon Frohman: a hapless, amoral everyman who keeps getting accidentally mistaken for the scientist who might save humanity from the alien Combine. Unfortunately, Frohman <i>loves</i> the Combine — but he’s so incompetent that he might accidentally become its greatest enemy.</p>

      <h3>The Stanley Parable</h3>
      <p>Okay, hear me out. Yes, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/17/4848072/free-will-is-overrated-the-stanley-parable"><i>The Stanley Parable</i> is best known</a> as an absurdist, highly self-aware standalone video game released by studio Galactic Cafe in 2013, not by its original status as a <i>Half-Life 2</i> mod posted in 2011. No, it has no narrative connection to <i>Half-Life</i> and could have been made in effectively any game engine, and it was one of multiple indie games to use <i>Half-Life 2</i>’s<i> </i>Source software as jumping-off point.</p>
      <p>But <i>The Stanley Parable </i>feels inextricably linked to <i>Half-Life 2</i> for one reason: the mod’s original protagonist was “played” by <a href="https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Citizen">Citizen Male 07</a>. Male 07 was simply one of <i>Half-Life 2</i>’s handful of generic oppressed citizen models. But thanks largely to <i>Concerned</i> and <i>Full Life Consequences</i>, where he plays Gordon Frohman and John Freeman respectively, he became a shorthand for a certain kind of goofy, guileless male protagonist — like the NPC version of a character actor. And <i>The Stanley Parable</i> played him perfectly to type.</p>
