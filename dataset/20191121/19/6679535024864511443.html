      <h2>Several rounds of talks have failed, they allege</h2>

      <p>The contract workers of Aurobindo Pharma Limited at Pydibhimavaram on Thursday staged a dharna in front of the office of Joint Labour Commissioner at Akkayyapalem to press their demand for wage revision.</p>
      <p>“The removal of the union leader Shyamala Rao has been brought to the notice of the Labour Department. We demand his reinstatement. The leaders of Aurobindo Pharma Contract Workers’ Union have been subjected to harassment since 2010. We want it to end,” CITU State president Ch. Narsinga Rao said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rao further said the wage revision was due in 2018 after implementing two revisions in 2012 and 2015. “Though seven rounds of negotiations have been held, but to no avail. We want the talks resumed for increasing the daily wage from ₹350 to ₹450,” Mr. Rao said.</p>
      <p>Among others, CITU-affiliated union’s president Govinda Rao, working president Tejeswara Rao and general secretary Guru Naidu took part in the protest.</p>
