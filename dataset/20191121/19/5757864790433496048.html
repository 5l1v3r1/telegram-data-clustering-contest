      <p>A few weeks ago, 31-year-old medical student Viktor Usov answered a call from the Santa Fe Animal Shelter claiming to have found his cat, Sasha, who had wandered off five years ago—and 1300 miles away from New Mexico.</p>
      <p>Usov, who lives in Portland, Oregon, first thought it was surely a different cat. But his name was listed on the microchip, and the shelter workers described a black, long-haired, friendly feline that sounded exactly like Sasha.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/11/portland-man-to-reunite-with-lost-cat-found-1300-miles-away-after-five-years-on-the-loose.html">According to</a> OregonLive.com, after Usov <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501389/11-surprising-facts-about-cat-adoptions">adopted</a> the cat from the Oregon Humane Society six years ago, his tender loving care (and his mother’s acupuncture treatments) helped cure Sasha’s distended stomach and chronically runny nose. Sasha soon became affable and spirited, even forming a friendship with Usov’s labradoodle puppy, Tara.</p>
      <p>A year later, when Sasha disappeared during a walk, Usov assumed the worst.</p>
      <p>“We waited a week or so, but when we didn’t get a call from the Humane Society and no one returned him, we figured a coyote got him,” Usov told OregonLive.com. “We were upset but we moved on.”</p>
      <p>Not only did Sasha evade every coyote from Portland to Santa Fe, he also somehow managed to stay well-fed and healthy during his epic journey south.</p>
      <p>“How [he] managed to survive to get here is the million-dollar question,” Santa Fe Animal Shelter spokesperson Murad Kirdar <a href="https://www.sfreporter.com/news/2019/11/18/from-portland-to-santa-fe-a-cats-journey/">told</a> the <i>Santa Fe Reporter</i>. “I can tell you [he] hasn’t missed a meal.”</p>
      <p>While Kirdar thinks Sasha might have hitched rides on U-Hauls, trains, and/or cars, Usov imagines that his beloved pet embarked on a spectacular sightseeing tour of the West.</p>
      <p>“He went on a grand American adventure,” he <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/portland-cat-turns-up-1300-miles-away-five-years-later-santa-fe-new-mexico/283-657bf08c-8683-4b05-bcdd-ecd755924e53">told</a> KGW. “He stopped by the Grand Canyon, Crater Lake; he saw the monuments, all the national parks, definitely Redwood Forest.”</p>
      <p>Sasha might be more adventurous than most house cats, but he’s far from the only one who has turned up years later and miles away—find out the incredible lost-and-found stories of Alfie, Crockett, and seven other cats <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/57394/9-incredible-stories-lost-and-found-cats">here</a>.</p>
