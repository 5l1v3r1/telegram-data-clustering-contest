      <h1>Hill: 'Often when women show anger it's not fully appreciated'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:20:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/person/fiona-hill">Fiona Hill</a>, the former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, said she was “angry” with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> and had “a few testy encounters” with the ambassador. </p>
      <p>"I was actually, to be honest, angry with him,” Hill said during her public testimony on Thursday. </p>
      <p>“And I hate to say it, but often when women show anger it's not fully appreciated, it's often pushed off onto emotional issues, perhaps, or deflected on other people,” she added. </p>

      <p>Hill said she was angry that Sondland “wasn’t coordinating with us.” </p>
      <p>However, Hill said she realized after watching Sondland’s deposition on Wednesday that the ambassador was “absolutely right — he wasn’t coordinating with us because we weren’t doing the same thing.” </p>
      <p>She said Sondland seemed to be “involved in a domestic political errand,” whereas she was involved in “national security foreign policy.” </p>
      <p>“I had not put my finger on that at the moment, but I was angry with him and irritated with him that he wasn’t fully coordinating,” Hill said. “I did say to him, ‘Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up.’ And here we are.”</p>
