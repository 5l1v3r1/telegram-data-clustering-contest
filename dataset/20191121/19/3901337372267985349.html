      </p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/english-premier-league/breaking-tottenham-hotspur-appoint-jose-mourinho/667797">replaced Mauricio Pochettino</a> following a string of poor results that saw the Argentine, who guided Spurs to the UEFA Champions League final last season, being relieved of his duties.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is well known for splashing the cash in the transfer market, and is expected to make some changes to his new squad over the next two windows.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether or not he can convince chairman Daniel Levy, who is known for not spending too much, to open the cheque book for new players, but who are the stars on the club's radar at the moment?</p>
      <p>Early reports suggest that Mourinho could attempt to improve in three areas, namely the right-back position, at centre-back and up front.</p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/categories/nivea/poll/sa-s-real-madrid-dream-team-you-choose-the-right-winger/667421">Choose the right winger for SA's Real Madrid Dream Team &amp; win a replica shirt!</a> </b>
      </p>
      <p>Kieran Tipper, who left for Atletico Madrid at the beginning of this season, has never been replaced on the right side of defence, and Mourinho could look to Youcef Atal as a perfect fit for his system. The OGC Nice and Algeria defender was one of the standout performers during his country's 2019 Africa Cup of Nations triumph, and has been making positive headlines in Ligue 1 too.</p>
      <p>Further up front, Paulo Dybala could become the club's No. 1 priority after Spurs reportedly looked at him in the previous window, and the Argentine seemed open to the idea of leaving Juventus. Free agent Zlatan Ibrahimovic could also be a short-term solution as a back-up for Harry Kane, and add some much-needed experience to the young squad.</p>

      <p>However, several Lilywhites stars will also fear for their futures under the new coach. Christian Eriksen is one of the players with expiring deals, and it remains to be seen whether or not Mourinho decides to convince him to stay or let him leave for free at the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>In addition, stars such as right-back Serge Aurier and winger Erik Lamela, who have blown hot and cold with their form, could also soon appear on the boss' axe list. You can see all players linked with moves to and from Spurs in the gallery above.</p>
