      <p>The <a href="https://footwearnews.com/t/nike/">Nike</a> Air Force 1 has gotten one of its glitziest updates yet, thanks to K-pop phenom G-Dragon of Big Bang.</p>
      <p>The singer’s brand, Peaceminusone, posted an Instagram today, showing off an over-the-top bedazzled version of the Air Force 1 “Para-Noise” that features crystal detailing across the upper and on the tongue. A metal hinge clip, part of Peaceminusone’s signature branding, appears on the laces.</p>

      <p>Although only a single image has been made available so far, it shows the entirety of the shoe’s top half covered in shimmering crystals — potentially provided by Swarovski, who’s also worked with Nike on Air Max 97s and Vapormax Flyknit 2.0s in years past. Swooshes are noticeably absent on both the lateral and medial sides, while a glistening daisy graphic appears on the black leather tongue and a large metallic silver heel clip is clamped onto the right shoe’s thick black flat laces. The sockliner and midsole are the only things that are simple here, as both are dressed in a crisp white.</p>
      <p>It’s yet to be determined if these pop-star worthy kicks are a special bespoke edition created for G-Dragon himself, a limited friends-and-family release like the limited-to-88 yellow Swoosh-equipped iterations, or a design that’ll see a full retail release. Check out PEACEMINUSONE’s post above, and stay tuned for further information as it’s made available.</p>
      <p>In other Air Force 1 news, former NFL quarterback and social justice activist Colin Kaepernick recently teased a new AF1 collaboration during his workout at an Atlanta-area high school.</p>
