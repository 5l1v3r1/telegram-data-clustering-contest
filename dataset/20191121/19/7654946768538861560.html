      <h1>A ‘Game of Thrones’ alternate ending exists, Kristofer Hivju says</h1>

      <p>“Game of Thrones” had the most contentious series finale in modern TV — but there might be another ending out there.</p>
      <p>Kristofer Hivju, who played Tormund Giantsbane, says the death of Daenerys might not be the last word.</p>
      <p>“We shot an alternate ending,” the Norwegian cast member <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/game-thrones-cast-filmed-alternative-ending-season-8-well-never-see-reveals-tormund-star-kristofer-hivju-11179830/">told Metro UK</a>. “That was mostly for fun, but I don’t know if I’m allowed to tell you about that.”</p>
      <p>The Season 8 finale of the hit HBO show aired in May, but that hasn’t stopped the world from arguing about it — even months later. The most <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/19/how-the-final-season-of-game-of-thrones-blew-it-more-than-lost/">contentious aspects</a> of it? Aside from <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/another-twist-in-the-game-of-thrones-cup-controversy/">who really left that coffee cup on set</a>, the biggest disappointment was the whiplash downfall and death of fan-favorite character Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), slain at the hands of her lover-nephew Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and the reveal that the ultimate king of Westeros, in the end…was Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright), a character who was such a boring non-entity that the show itself benched him for a season in the middle (Season 5).</p>
      <p>Fans were so incensed by what happened that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/15/angry-game-of-thrones-fans-sign-petition-demanding-season-8-remake/">a petition to reshoot Season 8</a> “with competent writers” currently has nearly 2 million signatures.</p>
      <p>Hivju, whose character Tormund got to live happily ever after with his buddy Jon Snow and direwolf Ghost, declined to reveal details about this “alternate ending.”</p>
      <p>“I won’t tell you!” he said. “But it was fun!”</p>
      <p>In the meantime, fans can get their fix with <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/30/what-we-know-about-game-of-thrones-prequel-house-of-the-dragon/?_ga=2.261881739.761760006.1574110869-1334335032.1566418139">“House of the Dragon,”</a> HBO’s forthcoming prequel show about the Targaryens, which doesn’t yet have a release date. The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/14/game-of-thrones-prequel-series-already-has-a-working-title/">prequel pilot</a> starring Naomi Watts <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/game-of-thrones-prequel-axed-another-is-on-the-way/">has been axed</a>.</p>
