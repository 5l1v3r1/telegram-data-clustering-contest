      <blockquote>Each symbol comes in a wide range of weights and scales, allowing you to easily design adaptable interfaces that look great. Symbols are easy to integrate into your app directly from within Xcode. And if you need a symbol that isn’t provided by SF Symbols, you can export template files to create your own with the same capabilities using a vector graphics editor. Version 1.1 adds custom symbol validation, a new sidebar with categories for faster browsing, and the option to receive updates automatically.</blockquote>
