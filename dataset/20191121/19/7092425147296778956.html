      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/ben-foden-una-healy-x-factor-celebrity-340086"><i>Ben Foden</i></a> says ex-wife Una Healy has always been supportive of his music career.</p>
      <p>People were shocked to learn that the former England player would be taking part in X Factor: Celebrity alongside fellow rugby stars <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/x-factor-celebritys-thom-evans-responds-to-nicole-scherzinger-dating-rumours-343842"><i>Thom Evans</i></a> and Levi Davis, but boyband Try Star have proven to be a hit with viewers of the show.</p>
      <p>Having been married to Una, who was a member of girl group The Saturdays, for six years, it came as a bit of a shock when <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/nicole-scherzinger-flirts-una-healys-ex-ben-foden-x-factor-audition-340162"><i>Ben</i></a> revealed that he would be trying his hand at singing.</p>

      <p>However, the dad-of-two, says <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/nicole-scherzinger-flirts-una-healys-ex-ben-foden-x-factor-audition-340162"><i>Una</i> </a>is hugely supportive of his career change despite their split.</p>
      <p>"Una always used to encourage me to do the music thing. When I told her that I was doing The X Factor she thought it was a great idea. She loves it," Ben told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7708989/Ben-Foden-EXCLUSIVE-X-Factor-star-reveals-ex-Una-Healy-encouraged-music-thing.html"><i>MailOnline</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Despite divorcing each other after <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/ben-foden-says-life-mess-cheating-una-healy-323117"><i>Ben's infidelity</i> </a>came to light in 2018, he insists that he and Una have put their differences aside and that she loves his band.</p>

      <p>He continued: "Una and I have a good relationship for the sake of the kids. I always wish her the very, very best. And the kids are loving The X Factor.</p>
      <p>"Their mum is obviously mega talented at singing. She always says when she catches the show, sometimes she's busy, but she thinks Try Star are doing great."</p>
      <p>Ben has since remarried following the pair's divorce after finding love with <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/ben-foden-marries-girlfriend-two-weeks-334400"><i>Jackie Smith</i></a> earlier this year.</p>
