      <p>Mourinho’s arrival appears to have left a new question mark hanging over the futures over the three Spurs men.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/jose-mourinhos-plans-tottenham-contract-20924759">The Daily Mirror reports</a> that the trio are out of contract in the summer. However, they are all said to be intrigued by the prospect of working under Mourinho. And they are all reportedly open-minded about potentially staying and extending their contracts.</p>
      <p>And Jenas has suggested that he can see two of the three men staying beyond this season, but anticipates that the other may be shown the door whether he wants to stay or not.</p>

      <p>“I think he will sort out the Vertonghen and Alderweireld situation. He loves experience. It makes sense not to spend there and look after them instead,” <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/">he told the Daily Mirror (22/11; page 81)</a>.</p>
      <p>“I bet they’ll sign new deals in the next six months. I think he might let Eriksen leave, believing he doesn’t desperately need him.”</p>
      <p>While none of the three players have been at their best this season, it could potentially be a real boost for Spurs if they do end up staying.</p>
      <p>If Mourinho is capable of getting any of the three players back to their back in the coming months, it would be fantastic for Tottenham to agree a contract extension.</p>
      <p>They all need to prove that they can rediscover their best form to win the frustrated supporters over again. But they certainly each have the quality to respond to their critics during the remaining months of the season.</p>
