      <p>He has a bit of a reputation for not always making the best of a photo-opportunity and now he's done it again by not checking the background.</p>
      <p>A few years ago he had some election leaflets published which when folded to go through doors split his surname so only half (or to be precise four-sevenths) of his surname appeared above his picture.</p>
      <p>Then he managed to be photographed on a bike at the launch of a new skills programme - without noticing that he was pictured in front of some graffiti saying "Sack Cameron."</p>
      <p>Now he's managed to get himself filmed during a trip to Yorkshire right in front of a tree. Now there's nothing wrong with being photographed with a tree - but the effect in this is just extraordinary. If I'd wanted to hear what he was saying I just couldn't concentrate because the image we have here is just so, well there's no other word for it, hilarious!</p>
      <p>He did get a bit of stick on Twitter because of the tree - and to be fair when he set off from the West Midlands the following day he made sure there was no tree behind him . . . even making a point of noting that on his feed!</p>
