        <b>Police have detained a union council member of Sylhet’s Zakiganj Upazila after his video of beating up a man in arbitration drew criticisms on social media.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Abdus Salam, member of Kajalshah Union Parishad, was arrested at Kanaighat along the border with India on Thursday afternoon, police said.</p>
      <p>The incident in the video occurred three to four months ago, but no one had complained about it, Additional Superintendent of Police Mahbub Alam said.</p>
