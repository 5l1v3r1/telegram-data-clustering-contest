      <h2>27 wards of the city to be assessed under ‘Operation Breakthrough’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:23:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Preliminary studies to ascertain the reasons for waterlogging in 27 wards of the city got under way on Thursday under ‘Operation Breakthrough’, the district administration’s project to resolve recurrent waterlogging issues.</p>
      <p>As many as 11 teams comprising assistant engineers and overseers under the leadership of assistant executive engineers of the PWD Roads Division, Minor Irrigation Department, Greater Cochin Development Authority, and the Kochi Corporation visited wards that experienced severe waterlogging on October 21.</p>
      <p>“The preliminary visits were conducted to determine the difficulties of people in the area, identify spots where waterlogging was severe and determine the reasons for it, assess the remedial work required, and prepare an estimate of expenditure. Further field visits will be conducted in the next few days to collect detailed data,” said S. Shajahan, nodal officer of the project.</p>
      <p>In the first phase, only wards within the city were chosen and not all areas falling within the corporation limits, he said, adding that residents associations, shop owners, and ward councillors would be consulted while assessing the situation.</p>
      <p>The proposals for work to be taken up are to be submitted by 4 p.m. on November 26. Only short-term solutions can be developed in this period and long-term solutions will involve larger discussions with departments like the Railways, said Susan Solomon Thomas, assistant executive engineer in charge of Perumanoor, Ravipuram and Ernakulam South divisions. The width of some drains has reduced, while a few culverts and drains are clogged near the South railway station, she noted.</p>
      <p>Localised solutions are few, and planning will have to be taken up on the larger regional scale, said David Y., assistant executive engineer in charge of Kathrikadavu and Kaloor South.</p>
      <p>Deepak Joy, councillor from Ayyappankavu, said only an overseer was sent to the ward, and that looking at wards separately would not resolve the issue—work in various divisions would have to be coordinated.</p>
      <p>A technical committee constituted to address waterlogging will have powers to give clearance to work of up to ₹1 crore. Only the executive committee of the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is empowered to give the nod for work costing more. It is up to the technical committee to select departments for carrying out individual work. A report in this regard will be submitted to the District Collector before December 2.</p>
      <p>While the goal is to wrap up all work towards resolving waterlogging in the city in the first 90 days of next year, Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) will oversee the activities, assuming the role of a quality auditor. The District Collector has issued directions to take action under various sections of the Disaster Management Act against those seeking to hamper the activities under Operation Breakthrough.</p>
