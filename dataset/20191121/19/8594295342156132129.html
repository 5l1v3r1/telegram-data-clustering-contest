      <p>This week has been all about tweeners. Chevy has one, Buick has one, Kia has one, and now Mazda has one, ready to fill white space between the subcompact CX-3 crossover and compact CX-5 crossover. It’s name, as you know, is CX-30, and it’s bound for a Mexican assembly plant in short order.</p>
      <p>While we’ve seen the overseas model before, Mazda took the opportunity to use the LA Auto Show as a backdrop for the model’s U.S. reveal. Don’t worry about power in this thing.</p>
      <p>European customers can expect a 1.8-liter diesel four-cylinder as a starting point, but Mazda has a 2.5-liter gas mill ready to do some heavy American lifting. It’s an engine you know well, making 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque — a considerable amount for a vehicle of this size. Handling the shifting duties is a six-speed automatic; old, yes, but Mazda has a pile of them on hand.</p>
      <p>Heavily cladded around the wheel wells and rockers, the CX-30 neatly splits the difference between the CX-3 and CX-5 in terms of size (read more about its dimensions <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/03/mazda-cx-3-too-small-try-the-cx-30-on-for-size/">here</a>), but it’s far closer to its smaller sibling in terms of price. Starting at $22,945 after destination for a base, front-drive model, the CX-30’s entry price tops that of a base 2019 CX-3 by $1,660.</p>

      <p>Opting for all-wheel drive brings the CX-30’s price floor to $24,345 after destination. Thankfully, AWD is available throughout the trim range. If extra creature comforts interest you, the model’s range goes up through Select, Preferred, and Premium, topping out with the $30,645 Premium AWD.</p>
      <p>Should you opt to take your AWD CX-30 off-road, a new traction feature could help you navigate through the rhubarb. When the vehicle’s giant electronic brain detects a lack of traction on one wheel, it applies the brakes on that problem customer, transferring the torque to the wheels still in contact with solid terra firma.</p>
      <p>Depending on trim, wheel choice ranges between 16 and 18 inches, with LED taillights and running lights as a standard feature. So is an 8.8-inch center display screen. Unfortunately, you’ll need to step up to Premium in order to gain LED headlights.</p>

      <p>As for safety features, Mazda’s i-Activsense comes standard. Among the nannies in its control are driver attention alert, radar cruise control with stop and go function, lane departure warning with lane-keep assist, smart brake support, and high beam control. All CX-30 buyers can avail themselves of Mazda Connected Services, accessible via the MyMazda app.</p>
      <p>Expect to see the CX-30 arrive early next year. The new crossover, once established in the brand’s U.S. lineup, could help Mazda reverse a trend of falling volume, though time will tell if its presence cannibalizes sales of its two closest stablemates.</p>
