      <h1>Jack Ross hoping for quiet first transfer window at Hibernian</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-ross/"><b>Jack Ross</b></a> has challenged his new <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/hibernian/"><b>Hibernian</b></a> players to pick up the points that mean he will not have to go shopping for replacements in January.</h2>

      <p>The new manager has completed his first signing a week on from being appointed, with former Liverpool goalkeeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-bogdan/"><b>Adam Bogdan</b></a> rejoining the club on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>Ross has inherited a squad sitting just two points above the relegation slots but he admitted he would prefer not to make bulk buys once the winter transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>The former Alloa, St Mirren and Sunderland manager said: "My assessment of the squad is only just beginning.</p>
      <p>"Ideally, I'd like to not have to do much in January because that would mean between now and the winter break we would have picked up a lot of points. That's the perfect scenario.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has different approaches but for me it's not about sitting here having that threat over the players that I'm going to bring players in in January.</p>
      <p>"I want to start enjoying working with what I have here. The ideal scenario is that if they are that good I don't have to bring in anyone in come January."</p>
      <p>Hibs have won just two league games all season and that miserable run cost Paul Heckingbottom his job.</p>
      <p>But Ross has warned he will not make sweeping changes to how his side look when he takes charge for the first time at home to fourth-placed Motherwell on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said: "Speaking to people before I came here about this team this season, there was a lot of talk about fine margins and that the team should be more points better off.</p>
      <p>"Those fine margins would mean there is not an awful lot wrong.</p>
      <p>"For me it's not about looking back. I could only affect things as of Tuesday when I started to work with the players so that's what the focus is on.</p>
      <p>"I've stressed to the players that any changes we make will be gradual.</p>
      <p>"The biggest changes we make this week may be on the training pitch.</p>
      <p>"But I've not asked what Paul did as I think he's a very good coach and manager but all coaches and managers work in their own way. Slowly but surely we'll drip in our ideas.</p>
      <p>"This week has been more about me trying to learn as much about Motherwell in a short period of time as I haven't seen much of them for the last 18 months.</p>
      <p>"But it will be a good test as right now Motherwell are in a position in the league that we are aspiring to."</p>
