      <p>Israel's attorney general will announce at 1730 GMT Thursday whether he plans to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over corruption, the justice ministry said.</p>
      <p>Avichai Mandelblit will speak to media on the subject of allegations against Netanyahu at the ministry in Jerusalem, a ministry statement said without further details.</p>
      <p>The embattled leader faces a range of graft allegations, from receiving gifts worth thousands of dollars to a deal to change regulatory frameworks in favour of a media group in exchange for favourable coverage.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, who has been in power since 2009, strongly denies all the charges.</p>
      <p>It comes as he fights for his political future with the prospect of a <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/israeli-kingmaker-refuses-support-to-netanyahu-or-gantz-as-country-set-for-third-elections-in-a-year-263435">third election </a>in less than twelve months.</p>
      <p>Neither he nor centrist rival Benny Gantz have been able to form a governing coalition after September polls left them nearly neck and neck.</p>
      <p>The corruption allegations, which have been under investigation for several years, are widely seen as a crucial issue for his political future.</p>
      <p>An indictment might permanently damage Netanyahu's political career, whereas a reprieve could give him a new lease of life.</p>
