      <p><b>STONEHAM, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Fire investigators say a battery-powered hoverboard was to blame for a fire that severely damaged a Massachusetts home last month.</p>
      <p>Stoneham Fire Chief Matthew Grafton and state Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey said Thursday a teenager in the home escaped through a second-floor window and a dog was treated for smoke inhalation. Damages to the single-family home in the Oct. 12 blaze are estimated at $200,000.</p>
      <p>Investigators say the fire started on the first floor at the hoverboard left charging underneath the kitchen table.</p>
      <p>The fire was ruled accidental, but it remains unclear whether there was a failure of the hoverboard itself, the charger, or if the hoverboard had been left plugged in for too long.</p>
      <p>Grafton says hoverboards should never be left unattended or on a flammable surface while charging.</p>
