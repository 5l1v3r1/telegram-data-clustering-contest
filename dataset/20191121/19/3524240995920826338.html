      <p>Mr Godwin Emefiele, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria has said that Nigeria imports cassava derivatives valued at about 600 million dollars annually.</p>
      <p>Emefiele disclosed this at a meeting with governors of cassava-producing states in Abuja on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that CBN also signed Memorandum of Understanding with Nigeria Cassava Growers Association and Large Scale Cassava Processors at the event</p>
      <p>He explained that the country was blessed with several varieties of cassava that could be explored to optimum potential.</p>
      <p>He, however, pointed out that there was a need to adopt improved varieties and practices that would guarantee better yield, better processing efficiency, increased profit and improved standard of living for the farmers.</p>
      <p>“In achieving this goal, we are holding consultations with the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan and the National Root Crops Research Institute, Umudike.</p>
      <p>“Apart from foreign exchange conservation, increasing cassava production is a necessity as starch, glucose, sorbitol and other products currently being imported.</p>
      <p>“Statistics show that out of the 53.0 million metric tonnes of cassava produced in Nigeria annually, more than 90 per cent is processed into food for human consumption.</p>
      <p>“Whereas a significant industrial demand exists for the output of processed cassava, primarily as substitutes for imported raw materials and semi-finished products.</p>
      <p>“Potential demand that exists in our cassava value chain, demand High-Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF) in bread, biscuits and snacks is above  500,000 tonnes annually while supply is below 15,000 tonnes.</p>
      <p>“Demand for cassava starch is above 300,000 tonnes annually while supply is below 10,000 tonnes” he explained.</p>
      <p>According to him, the demand for cassava-based constituents in sugar syrup is above  350,000 tonnes annually while supply is almost nonexistent.</p>
      <p>He added that potential demand for ethanol in the country as a fuel for cooking, to power vehicles (E10), and other industrial uses exceeded one billion litres, while production was nearly zero.</p>
      <p>Emefiele noted that CBN was taking bolder steps in collaborating with the private sector, State Governments in Nigeria’s cassava producing areas and other stakeholders towards resuscitating the cassava sector.</p>
