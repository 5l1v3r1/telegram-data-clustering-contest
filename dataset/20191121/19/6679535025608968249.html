      <h1>Stakeholders elated over nod for KMTA Act</h1>
      <h2>KMTA may catalyse Centre’s sanction for Kakkanad extension of Kochi metro</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:19:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:19</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Stakeholders who worked day and night to research, coordinate and liaison with the State government to realise the historic Kerala Metropolitan Transport Authority (KMTA) legislation for Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode are on cloud nine, with the Legislative Assembly according its sanction for the Act, which is said to be the first-of-its-kind in India.</p>
      <p>The KMTA for the three cities will primarily strive to regain the lost glory of public transport, what with the number of public transport buses in Kerala falling from 34,000 in 2002 to around 15,000 in 2019. The Authority would enjoy wide-ranging powers, from planning, coordination and monitoring different modes of public transport – from buses, autorickshaws, taxi cars and ferries to cycles and other forms of non-motorised transport, said an official who worked closely in framing the legislation.</p>
      <p>“As per the Act, every effort will be made to emulate countries like Singapore, which set a global benchmark in the realm of public transport, by going the extra mile to ensure affordable, world-class and efficient commuting modes. Moreover, much can be done within the framework of the Act, in order to ensure last-mile connectivity and safe footpaths, walkways for pedestrians. Ultimately, it will make these cities more liveable, by ensuring seamless integration among different commuting modes. It will also bring in modern vehicles which cause minimal or no noise and air pollution,” he said.</p>
      <p>The aim is to bring about seamless mobility in order to increase productivity and prevent wastage of time and fuel. Moreover, the KMTA is expected to catalyse the Centre’s sanction for the 11-km-long Kakkanad extension of Kochi metro, since the Centre has specified such an authority as a pre-requisite. The Act would also be a shot in the arm for the ₹740-crore Water Metro project of Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL), said another expert associated with the drafting of the legislation.</p>
      <p>Elaborating on the provisions of the Act, KMRL Managing Director Alkesh Kumar Sarma spoke of how the authority will be vested with powers to integrate planning, design and implementation of initiatives involving different modes of commuting. “It will help coordinate public transport in the State’s metropolitan areas, through seamless mobility and a common mobility card, ushering in efficiency. It will also help commuters plan their journeys better.”</p>
      <p>As per the Centre’s mandate, every city with a metro rail should have a Metropolitan Transport Authority to monitor, coordinate and control transporting systems. The KMTA Act would usher in smart, green and integrated transport in the State, said Mr. Sarma.</p>
      <p>Former managing director of KMRL Elias George, who played the leadership role in formulating a draft of the Act, said, “The KMTA Act will make public transport the dominant mode of commute. This will considerably lessen congestion.”</p>
