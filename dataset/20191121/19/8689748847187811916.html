      <p>If what we see outside is equivalent to what’s inside Moesha’s skirt, then one won’t be far from right to postulate that Moesha has the biggest “<b>Akosua Kuma”</b> or better still camel toe among all the ladies in Ghana.</p>
      <p>This is because Moesha Boduong has flaunted her camel toe on social media specifically Instagram for reasons best known to her and her followers especially the guys can’t keep quiet.</p>
      <p>She captioned the photo with “Don’t compare me to someone else because there is no one else like me!”</p>
      <p>Following the candid opinions expressed by her loyal followers, most of them were in shock as to whether the size of her camel toe as seen in her dress is real or not. Remember that there exists artificial camel toe designed outfit.</p>
