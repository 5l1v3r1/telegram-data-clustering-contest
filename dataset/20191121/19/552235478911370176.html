      <h1>John Hughes names ideal I'm A Celebrity camp-mate as Rangers legend gets the nod</h1>
      <h2>The former Falkirk and Inverness manager was asked who he'd like to share a jungle with.</h2>

      <p>John Hughes has named <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-gascoigne">Paul Gascoigne</a> as the best player he ever faced - and also his ideal camp-mate on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>At a special <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/william-hill-scottish-cup">Scottish Cup</a> edition of BBC Scotland's <i><b>Sportsound</b> </i>the panel were asked who they'd like to go on the famous reality show with.</p>
      <p>Michael Stewart insisted he'd like to take <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> to Australia and leave him there, while Hughes would prefer to share the camp with a former opponent.</p>
      <p>He said: "I wouldn't mind going on with Gazza.</p>

      <p>"He's probably the best player I've ever played against, he was a world class footballer."</p>
      <p>Stewart then asked whether he'd "left one on" the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> legend.</p>
      <p>"I did actually, but he got back up! I'd just like to find out the stories and the craic with him, and all the things he got up to.</p>
      <p>"I remember a story he used to tell about an ostrich he actually took on to the training pitch at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>"And he said: 'that wasn't the problem... the problem was trying to catch it again!'.</p>
      <p>"Imagine being in the jungle with him? He'd keep you going for sure."</p>
      <p>There was also time for some more serious discussion, with Hughes lamenting the current state of Falkirk.</p>

      <p>The former Bairns player and manager admitted: "It saddens me to see where they are at this moment in time.</p>
      <p>"My last game as the manager was the Scottish Cup final when Rangers beat us 1-0 and we still had SPL status. It got us into Europe for the first time.</p>
      <p>"So to see where it is now saddens me.</p>
      <p>"What the club needs is direction and stability, and that can only come from the top. It has to come from board room level.</p>
      <p>"You might hit a few bumps in the road but a vision to where we're going to go, and hopefully one day to take it back into the Premiership.</p>

      <p>"A few decisions have been made at the club that I think have backfired on them. One was Peter Houston.</p>
      <p>"Peter was close to getting the club back into the Premiership, I was very surprised to see Peter lose his job.</p>
      <p>"But it's a fantastic club. It just needs that direction and stability, and that needs to come from the top."</p>
      <p>That inevitably led to the question over whether Hughes would take the job if Lee Miller and David McCracken aren't given the job on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't want to see them unstuck, that's for sure, and if they were looking for a manager to go in there and steady the ship I'd have put my services forward.</p>

      <p>"I'd like the opportunity to talk to them, just about where they're going, how are they going to achieve it. Is the ambition there? Is the enthusiasm there to drive the club forward?</p>
      <p>"Because that's what it needs, it needs grabbed by the scruff of the neck.</p>
      <p>"Then there's the style of football, have you got players at your club or do you have to identify players that can come and play that style of football.</p>
      <p>"So those would be the questions I'd have to ask.</p>
      <p>"But I'm all for young guys, I do a lot of work for the SFA with all the young coaches coming through and I like to see young guys get an opportunity.</p>
      <p>"So I hope Lee and big Cracks do well, but it's all about getting results and that division isn't going to be easy."</p>
