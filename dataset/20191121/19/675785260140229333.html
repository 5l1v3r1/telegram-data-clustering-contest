      <p>The Duke of Cambridge arrived in Leicester Square, central London, for the annual Tusk Conservation Awards.</p>
      <p>Kate had been due to accompany William to the ceremony at the Empire Cinema in London’s Leicester Square and to a reception for nominees at the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
      <p>But a spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said she was no longer able to attend “due to the children”.</p>
      <p>She declined to comment further, but said the royal couple had met finalists at a tea at the Palace this afternoon.</p>
      <p>William, who has been Patron of Tusk since 2005, looked dapper as he arrived to cheers and loud drumming from the UK-based Ghanaian band One Drum.</p>
