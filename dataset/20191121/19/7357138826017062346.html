      <h1>Verizon And Snap Partner Up On AR, 5G Content</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:46:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Verizon has <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-innovation-partner-snap-inc">announced</a> that it’s partnering with Snap Inc., the company that owns popular social media video platform Snapchat, to provide 5G content for users, including enhanced augmented reality (AR) experiences. </p>
      <p>The initiatives will take advantage of Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband tech to not only provide innovative AR products, but content and new ways for people to communicate.</p>
      <p>Verizon’s 5G Labs and Snapchat said they are working to push the boundaries of what it means to experience live events as well.</p>
      <p>The 5G technology, which will be faster and have a higher bandwidth, is going to allow for new digital experiences, the release said, especially by leveraging Snap’s Portal Lenses, which can “transport fans backstage at a concert or provide spectators unique in-stadium experiences from their seat during the game.”</p>
      <p>Snapchat will come preloaded on certain 5G phones, and there will be exclusive offers for users through programs like Verizon Up.</p>
      <p>“5G will change the way people live, work and play and we’re partnering with leading companies like Snap Inc. to create unique experiences and new offerings,” said Frank Boulben, senior vice president of marketing and products, Verizon Consumer Group. “Our strategy is to partner with the best brands to ensure our customers have exclusive access to cutting edge technology and services. Our 5G Ultra Wideband technology should change the way mobile users forever experience places and events, evolving the way they see the world.”</p>
      <p>Snap Inc. Chief Strategy Officer Jared Grusd said he’s especially excited about the AR potential. </p>
      <p>“Major advances in high-bandwidth experiences are fueling the future of augmented reality,” said Grusd. “We are thrilled to partner with Verizon to move the industry forward through the development of creative and innovative 5G experiences on Snapchat.”</p>
      <p>Snapchat reaches about 200 million people everyday, with the majority ranging in age from 13 to 24. Verizon has been steadily upgrading its infrastructure, and since April it has launched <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/mobile/2019/verizon-5g-network-chicago/">5G service</a> in 18 cities and 16 <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/mobile/2019/verizon-5g-launches-at-nfl-stadiums/">sports arenas</a> around the country. </p>
