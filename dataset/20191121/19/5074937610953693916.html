      <h1>US promotes partnership with Ghana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:04:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:04</time> by <a rel="author">Albert Allotey, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 20, GNA – Mr Christopher J. Lamora, the US Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), has paid a two-day visit to Ashanti Region to promote partnership in economic development, education, and good governance between the United States of America and Ghana.</p>
      <p>While in the region he commissioned the new classroom block for the Ejuraman Integrated Community Center for Employable Skills (ICCES), a US Ambassador’s Special Self-Help project.</p>
      <p>A statement issued by the US Embassy and copied to the Ghana News Agency on Wednesday, said in 2018, the Embassy awarded the Centre a grant of $11,000 to complete construction on a four-unit classroom block to provide vocational training to more than 250 students.</p>
      <p>DCM Lamora lauded the ICCES Training Center for their continued efforts, saying; “We know that increasing access to vocational training is key to developing Ghana and creates a pathway to improving economic independence.”</p>
      <p>He also visited St. Monica’s College in Mampong, a former US Ambassador’s Special Self-Help grant recipient. Through the Self-Help fund, St. Monica’s College completed furnishings for an Information and Communication Technology Center that provides internet access and digital literacy training to its students.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador’s Special Self-Help Programme provides grants to small-scale, community development projects.  Selected projects must be initiated by the community, sustainable and not require additional support, and have substantial in-kind contributions from the community.</p>
      <p>Since the programme began worldwide in 1964, the US Ambassador’s Special Self-Help Programme has distributed more than $2.1 million to communities in Ghana to help support their development.</p>
      <p>Whereas in Ashanti Region, Lamora met with Manhyia Chief of Staff, Nana Kofi Badu and Chief of Protocol Ernest Sarhene to discuss local governance and security issues as well as areas of collaboration such as youth empowerment and economic development.</p>
      <p>DCM Lamora paid a courtesy call on the Ashanti Regional Minister, Mr Simon Osei-Mensah and discussed US partnership programmes in the region, which were being sponsored by the American people  </p>
      <p>While in Kumasi, he visited the EducationUSA Advising Center to discuss advising services offered to Ghanaians interested in studying in the United States.</p>
      <p>The EducationUSA is a US Government network of over 425 international student advising centers in 178 countries – two of which are in Ghana (Accra and Kumasi).  Both promote US higher education to students by offering accurate, comprehensive, and current information about opportunities to study at accredited post-secondary institutions in the United States.</p>
