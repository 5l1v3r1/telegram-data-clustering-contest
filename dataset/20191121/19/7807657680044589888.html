      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Kodi is looking for active developers to work on Kodi's UWP app.</li>
        <li>Kodi states that if no developers are interested, the UWP app will likely be dropped.</li>
        <li>Kodi began as Xbox Media Center for the original Xbox.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Kodi will likely drop support for its UWP app if the company doesn't find more developers. Kodi posted a <a href="https://kodi.tv/article/windows-developers-kodi-needs-you">"help wanted" post</a> (<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/kodi-might-drop-its-next-xbox-release-if-it-doesnt-find-new-windows-developers">via Neowin</a>) on its website asking for active and experienced Windows developers. The post states, "Bottom line, without developer interest, the likelihood of there being a UWP release for v19 is slim, and v20 would be zero."</p>
      <p>Kodi states that due to a switch to Python 3, there is a lot of work required to make things functional again within the Windows version of Kodi. The post bluntly implies that Kodi doesn't have an interest in the Windows platform, "This is a breaking change for us, and there is a lot of work that needs to be done to get things functional again. In turn, this has brought the lack of experience of (or even interest in) developing on the Windows platforms in the team to a crisis."</p>
      <p>Kodi is seeking active and experienced developers with knowledge of C++ on the Windows platform. More details on the desired experience of developers can be found in the <a href="https://kodi.tv/article/windows-developers-kodi-needs-you">blog post by Kodi</a>.</p>
      <p>Kodi started as Xbox Media Center on the original Xbox. Discontinuation of the Windows version could mean that Kodi never returns to its Xbox origins.</p>
