      <p>According to a government statement, Khan "reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to the advancement of Afghan peace and reconciliation process for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan."</p>
      <p>In Kabul, Ghani's office said the Afghan leader briefed Trump on the government's peace plan and Trump emphasised the need for a peace process owned and inclusive of the Afghan government.</p>
