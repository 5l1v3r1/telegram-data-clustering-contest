      <p>A former Hospsicare doctor who took to art in his retirement will have his work showcased on this year’s charity Christmas card.  </p>
      <p>After retiring from his role as a Hospiscare doctor in 2016, Tim Harlow turned his hand to art; his watercolour of a snowy Exeter street scene will be gracing this year’s Hospiscare Christmas cards.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on his career, he said: “I was a GP for 16 years before I joined Hospiscare. As a GP, I always found palliative care very rewarding for the opportunity to make a difference at an important time in people’s lives; joining Hospiscare seemed like the ideal next step. How people die is very important – really, it’s about living. At Hospiscare, I felt that helping people as a whole, not just their physical wellbeing but also emotional and social was really part of the culture.</p>
      <p>“Caring is a two-way street. Our patients heal us as much as we heal them; it’s one of the things I miss most about working at Hospiscare. Listening is incredibly important - I would always ask my patients, ‘Is there anything else we should know about you to help us care for you as best we can?’ One of the best things about Hospiscare was the extraordinary, meaningful conversations you’d end up having with people you’d just met when they came onto the ward.</p>
      <p>“Palliative care is a serious business, but that doesn’t mean it has to be solemn. Whenever you deal with Hospiscare people, you always end up laughing a lot – and I think people would rather be looked after by someone who’s having fun. The people I worked with were truly amazing; not just the nurses, doctors and healthcare assistants, but everyone from fundraising to housekeeping goes the extra mile.</p>
      <p>“Since retiring, I’ve been trying to work out what I’m good at. I’ve started writing a book about my experiences. I’ve acted in plays, cycled from Land’s End to John O’Groats and been lucky enough to travel to Namibia and Antarctica. Whenever I’m travelling, I take my notebook and sit and sketch what I see. Painting makes me look more carefully at things and notice the light and the colour; I find it very meditative.</p>
      <p>“I’m pleased to have a connection with Hospiscare still; working with such a great team and helping people at the end of their lives was a real privilege.”</p>
