      <p>The National Anti-corruption Bureau has launched criminal proceedings into possible high treason, espionage, abuse of office, embezzlement and misappropriation of property by Vasyl Hrytsak, ex-chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine, NABU press service told UNIAN.</p>
      <p>On October 25, the High Anti-Corruption Court ruled that NABU open the investigation into the case targeting, among others, the former chairman of the SBU.</p>
      <p>Court records indicate that on October 4 a criminal offense report was filed with the NABU, claiming that the former SBU chief had allegedly committed a number of crimes, including high treason, espionage, abuse of power, forgery, misappropriation and embezzlement of property or its seizure by malpractice.</p>
      <p>However, the court noted, no records have been filed with the Unified Registry of Pre-trial Investigations in due manner.</p>
      <p>The applicant, who is not identified in court records, claims that NABU official's failure to file the record within 24 hours from the date of receiving a report, constituted inaction in breach of criminal procedural law.</p>
      <p>On October 25, the court ordered that authorized officials at <a href="https://www.unian.info/politics/10726596-ex-nsdc-official-hladkovsky-freed-on-bail-in-corruption-probe-to-wear-ankle-monitor.html">NABU </a>file the relevant record.</p>
      <p>The NABU press service reported that the Bureau had complied with the court ruling.</p>
