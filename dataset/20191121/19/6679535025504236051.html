      <h1>DMK MLA stopped while proceeding to question grievances meeting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:01:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Coimbatore City Police on Thursday stopped Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MLA from Singanallur N. Karthik from proceeding to the Coimbatore Corporation school in Varadharajapuram where the district administration held the Chief Minister’s special grievances meeting.</p>
      <h3>‘Unfair’</h3>
      <p>Mr. Karthik said his reason to go to the venue was to question the administration officials for not intimating him of the meeting, which was held in his constituency. “It is unfair of the administration to keep me out of the loop,” he said.</p>
      <p>When he went there, the police stopped him 100m ahead of the school saying that it could lead to law and order problems, Mr. Karthik said and added that at that point around 300 DMK cadre were with him.</p>
      <p>He then reasoned with the officials that he was not there to create problems, but only to question officials and also present petitions on behalf of his constituency residents. He also wanted the officials to at least let him alone to the venue.</p>
      <p>Based on his request, the police officers went to the venue at the school.</p>
      <p>They returned after sometime saying the officials in the school had claimed that it was not a government function, but a party (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) function, Mr. Karthik said.</p>
      <p>But a communication from the district administration earlier in the day had said that Minister S.P. Velumani would participate in the CM’s special grievances meeting in the school, receive petitions from the public and also distribute welfare aid.</p>
      <p>Mr. Karthik said after the police told him that it was a party event, he questioned the officials’ rationale to hold the function at a government school and distribute welfare measures like old age pension there.</p>
      <p>And as the police officials did not have an answer, he left after registering his protest, the MLA added.</p>
      <h3>Law and order issues</h3>
      <p>M. Somasundaram, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Coimbatore East), who held talks with Mr. Karthik, said, “we pacified him stating that his grievance (that he was not informed about the meeting) can be brought to the attention of the minister after the meeting. This was to avoid possible law and order issues at the venue. He listened to us and left the venue with supporters,” he said.</p>
