      <h2>Three start-ups selected under STAMP to roll out their ideas on a pilot basis</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:23:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Ajeet-Mahale-13598/" target="_blank">Ajeet Mahale</a></address>
      <p>Last-mile connectivity to and from Metro stations is set to improve as new innovative solutions will be implemented on a pilot basis across stations of Mumbai Metro One.</p>
      <p>The initiative is part of the Station Access and Mobility Program (STAMP) being run by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) in collaboration with WRI India Ross Center and the Toyota Mobility Foundation.</p>
      <p>Under the programme, three start-ups — Orbo.ai, MYBYK and AllMiles — were selected out of 80 applicants to roll out their solutions at the Metro One stations. “We selected ideas whose probability of success was higher in Mumbai,” R. A. Rajeev, Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, said.</p>
      <p>While Orbo.ai uses artificial intelligence to increase the speed of commuters through the fare collection gates, the other two provide app-based transport for last mile connectivity.</p>
      <p>“More than 4.5 lakh people travel on Mumbai Metro One every day, yet the road below continues to be congested. The reason is that we haven’t looked at first- and last-mile connectivity and haven’t created a seamless network of mass transit,” Mr. Rajeev said.</p>
      <h3>‘BEST network dated’</h3>
      <p>He said the traditional modes of last-mile connectivity such as the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) had not kept pace with the changing commuting patterns in the city.</p>
      <p>“When the commercial districts in the city were in south Mumbai, BEST was able to provide very good and efficient last-mile connectivity. However, as businesses moved to areas such as Powai, Vikhroli and Andheri, it did not update its network, which led to poor last mile connectivity in these areas,” he said.</p>
      <p>The winners of the challenge will receive a combined research grant of up to $50,000 (₹3.6 million) to demonstrate their solutions. The deployment of pilot solutions is expected to start by mid-January 2020.</p>
      <p>Madhav Pai, India director, WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities, said they will be reviewing the solutions after three months to check their efficacy.</p>
      <p>MMRDA, Mumbai Metro One Private Limited and WRI India Ross Center will provide mentorship and implementation support to all the teams for designing and implementing the pilot.</p>
