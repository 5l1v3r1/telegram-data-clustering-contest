      <p>Credit to former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) light heavyweight champion, Chuck Liddell, for blazing a crossover trail outside of mixed martial arts (MMA) during (and after) his time in the spotlight. From his stint on Entourage <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2007/04/26/hbos-entourage-to-feature-chuck-liddell-this-sunday">way back in 2007</a> to “Dancing with the Stars” <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2009/08/17/chuck-liddell-joins-season-nine-cast-of-dancing-with-the-stars-on-abc">just a few years later</a>, “The Iceman” has seen and done it all.</p>
      <p>Well, almost all.</p>
      <p>One thing missing from Liddell’s resume was stand-up comedy, so longtime funnyman David Spade, along with popular comedian Whitney Cummings, enlisted the retired knockout artist for their “Lights Out” show and fed him jokes for an unsuspecting audience.</p>
      <p>Maybe he can do his next set at <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2017/3/15/14936942/ufc-fabricio-werdum-opens-comedy-club-brazil-mma">this new comedy club</a>.</p>
      <p>“Hey, what’s up, everybody? It’s me, white Pitbull. No, my name is Chuck Liddell,” he said. “If you don’t know my name and don’t know who I am, heckle me and you’ll find out. I hope my stand-up comedy goes better than my Jeopardy try out. Boy, stand-up comedy is tough. You have to be able to complete a sentence. Hey, real quick, has anyone seen my neck? I had it in the car.”</p>
      <p>“I have this thing called R.M.S., Resting Murderer Face,” he continued. “I’m like an intelligent Rob Gronkowski. I don’t understand my own jokes, but I hope you do. My wife is tough, she’s like a female Ronda Rousey. I’ve got to go. I have protein powder and it’s not going to snort itself. Thank you, everybody. Good night.”</p>
      <p>I think the funniest part of this video is watching Liddell stumble and grumble his way through each joke, as he tries to remember the lines and deliver them with a humorous inflection. And hey, it sure beats his <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2007/03/01/chuck-liddell-is-wasted-on-texas-show">legendary performance on Good Morning Texas</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking of punchlines, remember <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2012/9/19/3358518/arianny-celeste-miguel-torres-jeff-ross-ufc-the-burn">this “Burn?”</a></p>
