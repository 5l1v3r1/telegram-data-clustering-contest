      <p>Israel's attorney general indicted Benjamin Netanyahu on a range of corruption charges Thursday, the justice ministry announced, potentially spelling an end to the prime minister's decades-long political career.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit "decided to file charges against the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for offences of receiving a bribe, fraud, and breach of trust," a ministry statement said.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, who strongly denies all the charges, becomes the first Israeli prime minister to be indicted while in office.</p>
      <p>Rightwinger Netanyahu, who has been in power since 2009, is Israel's longest-serving prime minister and dominates the country's political scene.</p>
      <p>The indictment comes as Israel faces a potential third election in a year, with neither Netanyahu nor his main rival able to form a government after deadlocked elections in September.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is not legally required to resign until he is convicted and all appeals are exhausted, but political pressure is likely to be intense.</p>
      <p>A close ally of US President Donald Trump, the 70-year-old may now ask the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, to grant him immunity from prosecution.</p>
      <p>The justice ministry statement said copies of the charge sheet had been sent to both Netanyahu's lawyers and the Knesset.</p>
      <p>The charges against him range from receiving gifts worth thousands of dollars to a deal to change regulatory frameworks in favour of a media group in exchange for positive coverage.</p>
      <p>Mandelblit is due to give a public statement, with Netanyahu expected to respond.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu has outlived most political rivals and Hugh Lovatt, Israel-Palestine analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the indictment may still not be "the end of the story".</p>
      <p>"Israel will now have to brace for a political roller-coaster ride over the coming months. Now more than ever Netanyahu will be fighting for his political and personal life."</p>
      <p>What are the allegations?</p>
      <p>In February, Mandelblit announced his intention to indict Netanyahu on charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery, following up on police recommendations.</p>
      <p>In May he extended until October a deadline for Netanyahu's pre-indictment hearing but rejected a request for a 12-month delay.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu has vehemently denied all the allegations, calling the corruption investigation a "witch-hunt" and alleging it has been motivated by his enemies' desire to force him from office.</p>
      <p>Of the investigations against Netanyahu, the third, known as Case 4,000, is seen as the most serious.</p>
      <p>He is alleged to have negotiated with Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder of Israeli telecommunications giant Bezeq, to get positive coverage on his Walla! news site in exchange for policies benefiting Bezeq.</p>
      <p>Mandelblit said in February he intended to indict Netanyahu for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in this case.</p>
      <p>Case 1,000 involves allegations Netanyahu and his family received gifts including luxury cigars, champagne and jewellery from wealthy individuals, estimated to be worth more than 700,000 shekels ($200,000, 185,000 euros), in exchange for financial or personal favours.</p>
      <p>Another case, known as Case 2000, concerns allegations Netanyahu sought a deal with the owner of the Yediot Aharonot newspaper that would have seen it give him more favourable coverage.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Weaker hand'Â </b>
      </p>
      <p>The decision is expected to have a wide-reaching impact not just on the embattled leader but on Israeli politics in general, as the country has been without a government for nearly a year due to political infighting.</p>
      <p>Neither Netanyahu nor his centrist rival Benny Gantz have been able to form a coalition government following deadlocked elections in September, with the country edging closer to a third election within twelve months.</p>
      <p>Earlier Thursday Israel's President Reuven Rivlin turned to the country's parliament in the hope of avoiding a third election in 12 months.</p>
      <p>Following the near neck-and-neck polls in September Netanyahu and Gantz were given four weeks each to try and form a new government.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, head of the Likud party, was given first go but failed. And Gantz, who leads the Blue and White coalition, admitted defeat late Wednesday after a similar period.</p>
      <p>Rivlin has now given parliament 21 days to find a candidate who can command the support of the majority of the country's 120 MPs.</p>
      <p>Gantz reportedly tried to woo MP's from Netanyahu's Likud party to join him in a broad national unity government, but there were no takers during the long and ultimately fruitless coalition negotiations following the September election.</p>
      <p>Ofer Zalzberg, analyst with the International Crisis Group think-tank, said Netanyahu would be severely weakened by Mandelblit's announcement.</p>
      <p>"Netanyahu has a weaker hand for the coming 20 days so may agree to compromises toward Blue and White he so far ruled out," he said.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu could now face internal threats from within his Likud party, Zalzberg added.</p>
