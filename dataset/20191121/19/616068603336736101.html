      <p>It was not a meeting with Santa, but local politicians did tell their MP what they'd like.</p>
      <p>North Okanagan-Shuswap MP Mel Arnold recently met with the Regional District of North Okanagan board on Nov. 20 to get input for the upcoming federal budget process.</p>
      <p>"It's good to hear the priorities for the communities so we can make submissions to the finance minister," said the Conservative MP.</p>
      <p>Bill Morneau has been reappointed as finance minister in the Liberal cabinet.</p>
      <p>Among the items RDNO directors brought to Arnold's attention were the new trail from Armstrong to Sicamous, housing, addiction treatment services and infrastructure for indigenous communities, including water and sewer.</p>
      <p>A pitch was also made for the proposed Greater Vernon cultural centre.</p>
      <p>"It's a regionally significant project," said Kevin Acton, RDNO chairperson.</p>
      <p>Funds are also being sought for wildfire and flood mitigation in the region.</p>
      <p>Representatives from the Greater Vernon Chamber of Commerce will meet with Arnold on Nov. 25 to discuss the 2020 federal budget.</p>
