      <h1>Jose Mourinho finally gets to work with Harry Kane at Tottenham Hotspur</h1>
      <h2>The new Spurs boss reportedly wanted Harry Kane at Manchester United.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:45:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho is the new Tottenham Hotspur manager after a dramatic 48 hours at the London club. Mauricio Pochettino was sacked and by half six the following morning the Portuguese had been appointed as the club’s new manager. </p>
      <p>In doing so, the new Tottenham boss will now get to implement a £170 million ambition from his time in charge of Manchester United. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4667363/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-tottenham-harry-kane/">As reported by The Sun </a>back in October 2017, Mourinho wanted Manchester United to break the bank to bring Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane to Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>The report suggested that United had previously had a £40 million bid for Kane rejected in the pre-Mourinho era. It was suggested that the Portuguese manager was happy for the club to spend £170 million on bringing the England international to Manchester. </p>
      <p>Of course, that never happened, as the wheels started to come off for Mourinho at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Now he is at Tottenham and can finally get the chance to work with a player he is clearly a big fan of. </p>
      <p>Kane, who of course owes plenty to the work of Mourinho’s predecessor Pochettino, will now have to try and improve his game even more under the demanding eye of one of football’s most divisive but successful managers. </p>
