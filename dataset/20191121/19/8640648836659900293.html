      <h1>#MeToo-related policy changes coming to Las Vegas casinos</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:16:40+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/richard-n-velotta/" target="_blank">Richard N. Velotta</a></address>
      <p>The Nevada Gaming Commission on Thursday approved amendments to state gaming regulations adding protections from sexual harassment and several forms of discrimination in industry workplaces.</p>
      <p>The amendment, approved unanimously by the five-member board, adds a page and a half of new language to Regulation 5 on the operation of gaming establishments and runs parallel to regulations in place by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Nevada Equal Rights Commission.</p>
      <p>Enforcement of the regulation takes effect immediately. However, a new section requiring a licensed gaming establishment to maintain written policies and procedures prohibiting workplace discrimination or harassment would not be enforced until the first day of the fourth month following the month of adoption, which would be March 1.</p>
      <p>Regulators first started talking about sexual harassment regulations in May 2018, three months after a sexual harassment scandal rocked Wynn Resorts Ltd. and led to the resignation of its chairman and CEO, Steve Wynn, in February 2018.</p>
      <p>Wynn has denied all accusations that he sexually harassed or assaulted employees over the course of several decades, even after stepping down from his corporate role and selling all his shares of company stock.</p>
      <p>Amendments to regulations were first proposed by former Control Board Chairwoman Becky Harris. When she was replaced in January, her successor, Sandra Morgan, continued the work. Morgan’s version of amendments expanded the regulation to prohibit workplace discrimination or harassment of a person based on the person’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability or national origin.</p>
      <p>It also includes businesses that work as suppliers, vendors, contractors or consultants to casinos and relate gaming businesses.</p>
      <p>When the state Gaming Control Board unanimously recommended forwarding the amended regulations to the commission at its Nov. 7 meeting, there was still some doubt as to whether the commission would consider it because Chairman Tony Alamo had said that he would be reluctant to consider a regulation outlining penalties for sexual harassment against Nevada gaming licensees until after complaints involving Wynn Resorts and Steve Wynn were resolved.</p>
      <p>The Control Board on Oct. 14 filed a five-count complaint against Steve Wynn accusing him of sexual harassment at the resort and requesting that the commission revoke his finding of suitability to hold a license.</p>
      <p>But Alamo said he felt there was enough new substance in the proposed gaming regulation amendment addressing sexual harassment to bring it before the full commission for consideration.</p>
      <p>The commission took no testimony at Thursday’s meeting, but held workshop meetings on the proposed amendments on Oct. 23 and Nov. 6, as well as in 2018 when Harris brought them up.</p>
      <p>Not everybody is happy with the amendments with some contending that they duplicate regulations already addressed by the EEOC and the Nevada Equal Rights Commission. Others say they fall short of their expectation of how casinos and their affiliated companies address sexual harassment.</p>
