      <p>The Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Coimbatore (ICCIC) welcomed the State government’s decision to withhold the hike in property tax rates in urban areas.</p>
      <p>Thanking Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani, V. Lakshminarayanasamy, president of ICCIC, in a statement on Thursday, said that the announcement would certainly help industrial and commercial establishments, and residences, situated in Coimbatore, which were very badly affected due to the economic slowdown, carry out their day-to-day activities without any distress and also help them overcome the present financial crunch.</p>
      <p>Expressing hope for the continuation of status quo in this regard, he appealed to the four-member committee constituted by the State government to “favourably consider” the representations of trade and industry sectors for property tax revision.</p>
