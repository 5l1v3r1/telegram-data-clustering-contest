      <p>THE Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring, has confirmed that 36,900 jobs have been created in the western region since 2016.</p>
      <p>The latest Labour Force Survey published by the Central Statistics Office shows that there are 2,327,000 people at work in Ireland today.</p>
      <p>Minister Ring said: “The new figures show that there are 219,800 people at work in the west region which comprises Mayo, Galway and Roscommon. This is a 20% increase since 2016 or 36,900 jobs.”</p>
      <p>Further Central Statistics Office figures indicate that the Live Register in Mayo for October 2019 has declined by 567 people in the last year.</p>
      <p>Since this government was formed in 2016 there are 3,172 less people on the live register in Mayo.</p>
      <p>“The latest data shows that there are more than 53,000 more people at work since this time last year, with 1,000 jobs being created a week.</p>
      <p>"There are over 2.3m people a week at work – surpassing the peak of 2007 by 74,700 jobs.</p>
      <p>“The unemployment rate has dropped to 4.9%. The jobs recovery has been regionally balanced – with over 162,000 new jobs created outside of Dublin since the beginning of 2016. This accounts for over six out of every 10 new jobs.</p>
      <p>“There is no room for complacency about the progress we have made. This is why the Fine Gael-led ghovernment has developed Future Jobs Ireland, a whole-of-government plan to secure Ireland’s economic success.</p>
      <p>“That is why we have signed the National Broadband Plan contract. With high speed broadband, we will ensure that 1.1 million people, almost a quarter of our population, will not be left behind.</p>
      <p>“It will now be possible for rural Ireland to take advantage of the opportunities that are presented by the digital economy and it makes remote working possible.</p>
      <p>"The strategy is about responding to the changing world of work ensuring that our economy is future-proofed.”</p>
