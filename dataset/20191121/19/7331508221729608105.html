      <h1>Ravens CB Marcus Peters: No hard feelings that Rams traded him</h1>

      <p>OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> cornerback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578378/marcus-peters">Marcus Peters</a> says he holds no animosity heading into Monday night's reunion with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>.</p>
      <p>"I don't got a chip on my shoulder," Peters said Thursday. "How did it end? I got traded, and I'm liking the situation I'm in right now. I just keep moving forward. I don't need other stuff like that. I understand the business of football."</p>
      <p>On Oct. 15, Peters was traded to the Ravens in exchange for linebacker <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134310/kenny-young">Kenny Young</a> and a 2020 fifth-round pick.</p>
      <p>In four games with Baltimore, Peters has intercepted two passes, returning both for touchdowns. He is the first player in NFL history to record a pick-six with two different teams in a single season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.</p>
      <p>Asked if this game means anything more to him, Peters coyly responded, "What game? Yeah, the football game means a lot to me. That's why I play it."</p>
      <p>Given that Rams safety <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10481/eric-weddle">Eric Weddle</a> said he won't <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28126139/safety-eric-weddle-says-share-ravens-intel-rams">give out any Ravens intel</a>, Peters was asked whether he shares the same loyalty with his former team.</p>
      <p>"I just focus on us," Peters said. "We have a game to play on Monday night. We're just going to go out and do our business."</p>
      <p>The Rams moved on from Peters just hours before acquiring cornerback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045373/jalen-ramsey">Jalen Ramsey</a> from the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. In 22 regular-season games in Los Angeles, Peters intercepted five passes, bringing back two for touchdowns.</p>
      <p>"I love Marcus Peters," Rams coach Sean McCoy said. "I can't say enough good things about my experience with him. We had a great relationship. He's a great football player, extremely smart. He has great ball skills, great instincts, and I really enjoyed our time together. I'm really happy to see how well he's done on a great team."</p>
      <p>Peters immediately ingratiated himself with the Ravens, treating the defensive backs to a dinner in his first two weeks with the team. His addition has made a huge impact on Baltimore's defense.</p>
      <p>In the first six weeks of the season without Peters, the Ravens ranked No. 23 in defensive efficiency. In four games with Peters, Baltimore is now No. 1.</p>
      <p>"I think he's a joy to be around," Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. "He can be very direct, and you can have an honest conversation about whatever it is coaching-wise and he's willing to listen."</p>
      <p>Peters was business-like in answering questions about returning to Los Angeles, but he did crack a smile when asked about how he plays the game.</p>
      <p>"Football is 90 percent mental, 10 percent physical," Peters said. "I learned that from the 'Little Giants,' man."</p>
