      <h1>REVIEW : The 39 Steps – Dulverton's Halloween Production</h1>
      <h2>Quite the silliest of plays was beautifully performed and staged by the Dulverton Player</h2>

      <p>Quite the silliest of plays was beautifully performed and staged by the Dulverton Players last week. Charlie Blanning, himself the miracle survivor of a devastating riding accident last year, more than survived this spy and murder ordeal as well, while directing and playing Richard Hannay. ‘Hannay’ is famous novelist John Buchan’s main character in last year’s, postponed ‘The 39 Steps’. The five strong cast, seeking out the riddle of where or what are ‘the 39 steps’, played to full houses at Dulverton Town Hall for four nights.</p>
      <p>If you know the best selling 1915 novel, or the 1935 film noir version, starring Robert Donat, then you were in for a surprise at this production. A modern adaptation, this is a comic send up of the original. And plenty of laughs there were too as Nicola Smith, Banger Milton, and Anne Markwick slipped effortlessly in and out of their 27 deliberately shared parts. Therein lies much of the comedy. One minute a milkman, the next a university professor, who just happens to be an assassin in his spare time. Or a quick switch from a WW1 pilot’s flying outfit and a posh accent, to a Hogmanay tam-o'-shanter and broad Scots brogue. These three actors even played each other's parts occasionally! The costume changes must have included the speedy skills of Jean Verrall, Louise Parrish, and Ann Durbin.</p>

      <p>Learning the quickfire lines, alongside changes of character, often without leaving the stage, was a real challenge which these three Players who managed the swaps with great good humour.</p>
      <p>Stability was brought to the whole by Charlie Blanning's portrayal of Hannay accompanied by his dynamic relationship with leading lady Suzy Wall who played the flirtatious Pamela. One minute she is shopping him to the police, or to foreign spies who are out to kill him, then removing her stockings while handcuffed to him in an armchair! We are not quite sure why this is happening except possibly a dark hint at a post-Edwardian, erotic, love interest which never did quite materialise.</p>
      <p>The 6th star of the show must be the Players’ new and emerging talent for eschewing the traditional, cumbersome flats, backdrops and flies, and the concomitant scene changes. They achieve this by projecting enormous, real life images onto the full stage screen set up behind the action. One minute the set can be a stately pile in the Home Counties, then a train carriage with the scenery speeding along outside, a London mews, or the Scottish Highland moors.</p>

      <p>A couple of stepladders double as tunnels, loft, and pilot perches, while the cast move the chairs minimally and effortlessly to reflect whether they are chuffing along in the grand, steam engine projected behind them, or racing uncomfortably in a vintage Bugatti, pursued by murderous villains.</p>
      <p>These technical fireworks are the creative work of Gerry Lewis, Simon Wood, Producer and Stage Manager Christine Dubery. The lighting challenges, which the screen’s imaginative innovation creates, were overcome effectively by Simon Williams and John Preston.</p>
      <p>Charlie Blanning's enormous lead part is on stage throughout; he carries this off fully in avuncular character throughout, soliloquising to the audience, maintaining the pace of the plot, wrestling with Pamela, managing Anne Markwick's daggered body flopped on top of him, while occasionally providing a commentary on the action in case we get lost in the pace or miss an obscure clue. It is so much fun that it isn't always easy to work out what on earth is going on. It is his authority, with the support of his Assistant Director Olga Owen, which neatly balances what could otherwise become a pantomimic farce, rather than a frantic comedy scuttling along.</p>

      <p>However, if you went expecting the dark and threatening film version or the brooding novel, a sort of James Bond precursor, you were certainly in for a surprise, which audience members rose to warmly.</p>
      <p>The whole complex presentation is pulled together by the Players usual backstage crew of 16, choreographing the subtleties of props, wardrobe, make up, photography, and publicity, including Melanie Bunn, Jill Doyle, and Rosemary Preston, working tirelessly on this complex staging for 12 weeks before curtain up.</p>
      <p>The Players next enterprise at Easter is "Dick Whittington" which will develop the talents of local children alongside some experienced, traditional, adult, pantomime actors.</p>
