      <h1>Report: Aston Villa interested in Austria Wien striker Christoph Monschein</h1>

      <p>Aston Villa are reportedly keen on signing Austria Wien striker Christoph Monschein.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sport.oe24.at/fussball/fussball-national/Aston-Villa-jagt-Austrias-Monschein/406762777">According to Sport 24</a>, Dean Smith’s side are intrigued by the Austrian but are being put off by his supposed €5 million/£4 million asking price.</p>
      <p>Wien are currently having a bit of financial difficulty though, and could be forced to cash in on their star striker.</p>

      <p>Villa have apparently been scouting Monschein in the run up to the January transfer window, and have been impressed with his haul of 13 goals in 18 appearances.</p>
      <p>One thing that could make a potential January move tricky is that management believe his sale could cause relegation.</p>
      <p>Smith has had faith in new signing Wesley to lead the line this season for Villa, but seemingly wants more competition for the Brazilian in addition to Jonathan Kodjia and Keinan Davis.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Cost-effective, but a gamble</h3>
      <p>Monschein is clearly in fine form, but the step up from the Austrian Bundesliga to the English Premier League is huge.</p>

      <p>Perhaps unfavourably, he has never played outside of his homeland before.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is not going to break the bank though, which could see Smith push for the move.</p>
      <p>£4 million is hardly anything in today’s market, and so he could be worth the gamble.</p>
