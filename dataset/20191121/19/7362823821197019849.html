      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/felicity-huffman">Felicity Huffman</a> feels "guilty" for leaving other women behind in prison and wants to help out after her release, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>After she served 11 days of her 14-day prison sentence for her role in the nation-wide <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/college-admissions-scandal">college admissions scandal</a>, the 56-year-old actress reportedly has been dedicating her time to helping women in prison improve their lives.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/felicity-huffman-wants-to-work-with-inmates-following-prison-release-source-says-136792">Entertainment Tonight</a> that "conditions at the prison were very difficult," explaining there were "no real programs or initiatives to help the incarcerated women who were there."</p>
