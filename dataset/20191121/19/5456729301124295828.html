      <p>The nation’s bourse on Thursday sustained upward trend for the third consecutive trading session with the market capitalisation improving by N46 billion.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the market capitalisation which opened at N12.923 trillion inched N46 billion or 0.36 per cent to close at N12.969 trillion.</p>

      <p>The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are; Flour Mills of Nigeria, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, MTN Nigeria, Dangote Cement and Dangote Sugar Refinery.</p>
      <p>Capital market analysts were of the view that the equities market would sustain gains in the near term although sentiment still remains weak</p>
      <p>Analysts at United Capital Plc said “Looking ahead, we still expect investors to position in value and dividend paying stocks in expectation of making solid gains.”</p>
      <p>Market breadth closed positive with 21 gainers and 12 laggards.</p>
      <p>An analysis of the price movement table shows that Cornerstone Insurance topped the gainers’ table to close at 77k per share.</p>

      <p>Conversely, Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) led the losers’ chart in percentage terms, dropping by 10 per cent to close at N18 per share.</p>

      <p>In spite of the growth recorded by market indices, the volume of shares traded closed lower with an exchange of 239.22 million shares worth N2.28 billion in 3,585 deals.</p>
      <p>This was against a turnover of 267.31 million shares valued at N3.05 billion achieved in 4,074 deals on Wednesday.</p>
