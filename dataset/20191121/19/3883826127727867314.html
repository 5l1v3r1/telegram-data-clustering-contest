        <b>A transplant patient died after a surgeon failed to disclose he had spilt stomach contents on organs which went on to be used in NHS operations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 36-year-old died of an aneurysm caused directly by infection from a donated liver, while two other patients became ill from transplants.</p>
      <p>The incident took place in 2015 but only came to light when one of the sick patients attended a hospital in Wales.</p>
      <p>It had involved a surgeon from Oxford University NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
      <p>The trust has agreed damages of £215,000 for one of the cases.</p>
      <p>Several organs became infected with Candida albicans, a fungal infection, after the surgeon cut the stomach in a donor while retrieving organs, spilling the contents over other organs.</p>
      <p>The surgeon did not tell anyone as he should have done and the organs were transplanted into three patients.</p>

      <p>One recipient died after receiving an infected liver, while a 44-year-old received a kidney and pancreas and a 25-year-old parent from Wales received a kidney.</p>
      <p>The incident only came to light after surgeons at Cardiff &amp; Vale University Health Board raised the alarm with the Human Tissue Authority and the Welsh Government.</p>
      <p>They became worried when the 25-year-old patient who received the kidney, and who was under their care at the University Hospital of Wales, became seriously unwell due to the infected organ.</p>
      <p>The patient, who does not wish to be named but is from south Wales, needed the donor kidney removing as an emergency after suffering extreme pain and extensive internal bleeding.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old was placed in an induced coma and given 16 blood transfusions, before spending a year on dialysis having never needed it before.</p>
      <h3>Risk of infection</h3>
      <p>The Oxford University trust has paid £215,000 in damages to the patient after they launched a legal challenge.</p>
      <p>A serious incident report by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said the surgeon had "no recollection of anything of note" when taking the organs, but had noticed a "small nick" on reflection which saw a small amount of stomach content spilt.</p>
      <p>The spill was not documented at the time of the procedure, meaning those receiving the organs and their doctors were unaware of the risk of infection.</p>
      <p>The NHSBT report concluded: "This incident represents an example of donor-transmitted infection with Candida albicans which contributed to the loss of one kidney graft and the death of a liver recipient.</p>
      <p>"The infection of the graft may have arisen during the retrieval procedure."</p>
      <p>The trust admitted it had been in breach of duty of care by the failure of the surgeon to record the cut into the donor's stomach.</p>
      <h3>'The surgeon wasn't honest'</h3>
      <p>In defence of the legal action, trust lawyers claimed that, despite the stomach spill, even if known at the time of transplant, the risk would have been considered low.</p>
      <p>But solicitor Jodi Newton, a medical negligence specialist at Hudgell Solicitors, representing the patient, said it was "a completely unacceptable breach of duty of care" which was "extremely damaging for patient trust in surgeons".</p>
      <p>The patient said: "What angers me to this day is that fact that the surgeon who removed the organs from the donor wasn't honest.</p>
      <p>"It was only when people who received the organs became unwell that the truth was told."</p>
      <p>Prof Meghana Pandit, chief medical officer at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: "This is a very unusual circumstance and we are keen to ensure that we do everything we can to make sure it doesn't happen again in future."</p>
      <p>John Forsythe, medical director for organ donation and transplantation at NHSBT, said: "Our thoughts are with the recipients and their families over this sad and unusual case.</p>
      <p>"We acted quickly to investigate what happened and we worked with transplant centres afterwards. Our report concluded the infection of the transplanted organ may have arisen during the retrieval procedure."</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether the families of the 36-year-old who died or the 44-year-old are aware of the incident.</p>
      <p>NHSBT said it was up to local transplant centres to inform patients about contamination.</p>
      <p>Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said the NHSBT investigation which took place after it reported the issue "did not identify any faults or concerns with procedures in Cardiff".</p>
