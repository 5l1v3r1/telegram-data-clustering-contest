      <h1>John Calipari, Roy Williams and other coaches team up for anti-cancer TV campaign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:07:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:07</time> by <a rel="author">Mike DeCourcy</a></address>
      <p>There are not a lot of subjects on which John Calipari, Roy Williams and Jim Boeheim can reach agreement. Each is a member of basketball’s Hall of Fame. Each knows what it’s like to win an NCAA championship. Each has sent players on to become NBA stars. So they’ve got much in common but still are rivals at their core.</p>
      <p>Except when they are teammates — as members of the Coaches vs. Cancer program.</p>
      <p>They are three of nearly two dozen coaches who will be featured in a new series of public service spots that will be included in 80 game telecasts on CBS, Fox Sports, FS1 and Big Ten Network. The first spot will air Sunday on BTN during Cal Poly’s visit to Iowa, and another will appear Monday on FS1 during Pitt’s game against Kansas State.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The spots feature multiple coaching greats, including Tubby Smith of High Point and Tom Izzo of Michigan State, as well as ACS researchers and cancer patients discussing the continuing fight to conquer the disease.</p>
      <p>“Cancer is universal — everyone is affected in some way. That’s why the college basketball coaching fraternity annually puts aside our rivalries and takes collective action to join the fight against this devastating disease,” Williams said in a release from ACS. “I’m proud to stand alongside my peers to raise awareness for increased access to early screening and detection. Together, we encourage all our fans to donate at CoachesVsCancer.org to help join the fight.”</p>
      <p>Coaches vs. Cancer has been around for nearly three decades, launched by Missouri legend Norm Stewart after his successful fight against colon cancer. Embraced by college basketball coaches from coast to coast and sponsored by the American Cancer Society, it has raised more than $125 million for the fight against various forms of this disease.</p>
