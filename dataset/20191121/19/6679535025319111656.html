      <p>The visitors to Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (IGZP) will now get to see new species from the animal kingdom, as the zoo authorities got Grant’s zebras, water monitor lizard and others as part of animal exchange programme, on Thursday.</p>
      <p>According to IGZP curator Yesoda Bai, a pair of Grant’s zebras, a pair of water monitor lizard, and a pair of Marmoset monkeys were received from the Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata. “The animals were brought from Kolkata in a parcel van unit of Shalimar- Secunderabad Weekly Express and shifted safely to the zoo in the presence of officials from both the zoos,” said Ms. Yesoda Bai.</p>
      <p>In exchange, she said, the IGZP sent two pairs of wild dogs, a pair of ring tailed lemur and a pair of grey pelicans to the Alipore zoo on November 18.</p>
      <h3>21-day quarantine</h3>
      <p>“The animals will be kept under observation during the quarantine period. They will be released to enclosures after being quarantined for 21 days,” added Ms. Yesoda Bai. The IGZP received a pair of Asiatic lions from Sakkarbaug Zoo at Junagarh as part of the animal exchange programme in August this year and in return, wild dogs were sent to the Sakkarbaugh Zoo.</p>
