      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- A Maryland woman collected her second top prize jackpot from a Bonus Match 5 lottery drawing 26 years after her first brush with luck.</p>
      <p>The 76-year-old Waldorf woman <a href="https://www.mdlottery.com/healthcare-retiree-beyond-grateful-for-2nd-bonus-match-5-top-prize-win/">told Maryland Lottery officials</a> she plays lottery games about once every two weeks, and she bought her winning ticket for the Nov. 9 Bonus Match 5 drawing at Westlake Liquors in Waldorf.</p>
      <p>The woman said she used a series of birthdays and other important dates to play nine boards and ended up winning $50,015.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't believe it," the winner recalled of seeing her numbers printed in the newspaper. "I checked it 15 times before believing it."</p>
      <p>The woman said she previously won a $50,000 Bonus Match 5 jackpot in 1993.</p>
      <p>The winner said most of the money will go toward paying her bills, but she might put some toward a trip to Paris.</p>
