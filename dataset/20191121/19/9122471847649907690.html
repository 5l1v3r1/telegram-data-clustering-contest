      <h1>Breaking: NFL Announces Ruling On Myles Garrett’s Appeal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:55:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The NFL announced a ruling on the appeal by Cleveland Browns defensive lineman Myles Garrett. The indefinite suspension is being held up.</p>
      <p>Appeals officers Derrick Brooks and James Thrash announced that Garrett’s indefinite suspension is being held up. Meanwhile, the suspension to Steelers lineman Maurkice Pouncey has been reduced from three games to two games.</p>
      <p>During his appeals hearing, Garrett reportedly accused Mason Rudolph of using a “racial slur” prior to last Thursday night’s fight.</p>
      <p>The NFL announced the decision on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Rudolph strongly denied the “racial slur” accusation from Garrett. His agent is accusing Garrett of lying.</p>
      <blockquote>“According to ESPN, in his appeal, Myles Garrett falsely asserted that Mason Rudolph uttered a racial slur towards him, prior to swinging a helmet at Mason’s uncovered head, in a desperate attempt to mitigate his suspension. This is a lie. This false allegation was never asserted by Garrett in the aftermath of the game, never suggested prior to the hearing, and conspicuously absent in the apology published by the Browns and adopted by Garrett. The malicious use of this wild and unfounded allegation is an assault on Mason’s integrity which is far worse than the physical assault witnessed on Thursday. This is reckless and shameful. We will have no further comment,” <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/pittsburgh-steelers/mason-rudolphs-agent-has-fired-back-at-myles-garrett">Rudolph’s agent said</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>Garrett will reportedly be allowed to apply for reinstatement after the season.</p>
