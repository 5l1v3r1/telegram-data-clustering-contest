      <p>A village hall could be set to receive a £1,000 cash boost thanks to the RGB Community Fund.</p>
      <p>Cadeleigh Village Hall was selected as a finalist in RGB’s Well Built Community Fund. It’s now down to a public vote to see if it’s chosen to receive £1,000 to spend at an RGB branch to update its kitchen area.</p>
      <p>The village hall is at the heart of the community, and its team regularly cooks up Sunday roasts for the villagers as well as organising events such as a harvest festival tea. The team also caters for local weddings and funerals.</p>
      <p>If chosen as the Community Fund winner, it will be updating its kitchen equipment and area to ensure it can continue to feed the local community.</p>
      <p>Cadeleigh Village Hall is up against Petroc Supported Learning in Barnstaple and Wellington Community Centre.</p>
      <p>Paul Hague, Branch Manager at RGB Tiverton, commented: “Our Well Built Community Fund continues to prove extremely popular and once again we were inundated with nominations from schools, community groups, projects and charities from the region, so congratulations to Cadeleigh Village Hall for being chosen as a finalist. As its local branch, we’re encouraging people in the area to get involved and vote.”</p>
      <p>Votes can be cast by visiting RGB’s Tiverton branch during opening hours and placing a chip in the relevant box, by voting in the poll that will be at the top of RGB’s Facebook page, or by emailing RGB@pmwcom.co.uk and putting the name of the group being voted for in the subject line.</p>
      <p>The vote will take place between Monday, November 18 and 8:00 am on Monday, December 2. Votes cast outside these dates will not be counted. Only one vote per person via one method of voting will be counted.</p>
      <p>The winner of the £1,000 to spend will be the group that receives the most votes.</p>
