      <p>Federal authorities in Virginia said Thursday that the 32-year-old New Jersey woman got three years and nine months in federal prison. She pleaded guilty in July to possessing with intent to distribute more than 400 grams of fentanyl.</p>
      <p>Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that can be stronger and more lethal than heroin.</p>
      <p>Barba appeared on reality television shows “American Idol” and “Fear Factor.” The investigation that led to her arrest began when police heard someone was going to deliver a large amount of fentanyl in the city of Norfolk.</p>
      <p>Police staked out a stash house and arrested Barba. She had arrived from Los Angeles that day.</p>
