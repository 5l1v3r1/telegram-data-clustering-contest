      <p>A man has been charged with attempted kidnapping after trailing a toddler into a Berkeley library, police say.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2019/11/20/man-charged-with-trying-to-kidnap-child-at-berkeley-library">first reported by Berkeleyside</a>, court records allege a nanny and a toddler under her care were at Bateman Park in Berkeley on Nov. 13 when they were approached by Marcus Deberry Jr., 28. Police told Berkeleyside the nanny took the boy to the Claremont branch of the Berkeley Public Library, but Deberry continued to follow them.</p>
      <p>According to a library employee, Deberry said, "that's my baby" as he attempted to grab the child. He then allegedly left the library and was found by police who viewed surveillance video from the library.</p>

      <p>Berkeleyside reports Deberry was already on probation for felony burglary.</p>
      <p>Jail records indicate Deberry is in custody at the Santa Rita Jail. His bail is set at $105,000 and his plea hearing is scheduled for Nov. 27.</p>
