      <h1>Apple Pilots Extended Deadline to Purchase AppleCare+</h1>

      <p>A select number of Apple Stores are piloting a new program that will allow customers to purchase AppleCare+ beyond the usual 60 days after purchase, reports MacRumors. The program was launched this week.<br/><br/><i>The pilot program allows customers to add AppleCare+ to a device between 61 days and one year after the device was purchased. To do so, a customer must book a Genius Bar appointment, during which a technician will run diagnostics on the device and perform a visual inspection to confirm eligibility.</i><br/><br/>All 29 Apple Stores in Canada and around 50 stores in the United States are participating in the program. The site was able to confirm the existence of the pilot at a participating store; however, the program could be altered at any time so its availability isn't guaranteed.<br/><br/>AppleCare+ extends the warranty on your device to 2-3 years and covers up to two incidents of accidental damage, each subject to a service fee.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/21/apple-store-extended-applecare-pilot-program/">Read More</a></p>
