      <p>There’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/21/20975860/valve-half-life-alyx-release-date-vr-announcement-first-screens-trailer">a new Half-Life game on the way, <i>Half Life: Alyx</i></a>, and it’s only playable in virtual reality. That’s not the only thing that could hold players back from giving it a try, however: The minimum specs needed to run the game are remarkably high, even for a virtual reality release.</p>
      <p>Here are the minimum specs for the game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/">as noted on Steam</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OS: Windows 10</li>
        <li>Processor: Core i5-7500 / Ryzen 5 1600</li>
        <li>Memory: 12 GB RAM</li>
        <li>Graphics: GTX 1060 / RX 580 - 6GB VRAM</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Holy moly. For reference, here are the minimum specs <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4061-QUZB-4602">for the Valve Index itself</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OS: Windows 10, SteamOS, Linux</li>
        <li>Processor: Dual Core with Hyper-Threading</li>
        <li>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li>
        <li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 / AMD RX480</li>
        <li>Network: Broadband internet connection</li>
        <li>Additional Notes: Available DisplayPort (Version1.2) and USB (2.0+) Port required</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Those are the minimum specs, though. Here are <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4061-QUZB-4602">the recommended specs</a> for the Valve Index:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Processor: Quad Core+</li>
        <li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 or better</li>
        <li>Additional Notes: Available USB (3.0+) Port required for Headset Pass-Through Camera</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The minimum specs for <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> are comparable to the recommended specs for the Valve Index, which means that a lot of people are going to have to upgrade their system, and probably purchase a VR headset, before being able to play the next chapter in the Half-Life story.</p>
