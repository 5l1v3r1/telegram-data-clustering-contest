      <h3>Penrith Panthers playmaker Nathan Cleary has admitted the handling of the sex-tape scandal had a negative impact on the side in 2019.</h3>
      <p>The Panthers, who entered 2019 among the competition favourites, were rocked when young star Tyrone May was with two counts of recording an intimate image without consent and two counts of distributing an intimate image without consent in March.</p>
      <p>May, who is still contracted with the Panthers, has pleaded not guilty and is due to face court this week.</p>

      <p>Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Cleary was critical of the approach the club took to the scandal but said ultimately the responsibility for the poor season lay with the players.</p>
      <p>“It did affect us a bit, as much as we never really spoke about it, which was probably the worst thing to do looking back,” Cleary said.</p>
      <p>“We can’t really make excuses for what happened last year.</p>
      <p>“Although stuff did go on in the off-season, ultimately it was down to us and we had the team to do it but I think we kind of got to Round 1 and that early part of the season we just kind of all thought it was going to all fall into place.</p>
      <p>“You just can’t do that in the NRL, teams are too good and it’s a really level playing field.”</p>
      <p>After qualifying for the finals in 2018, the Panthers finished a disappointing 10th under new coach Ivan Cleary in 2019.</p>
