      <p>Earlier, Saif had expressed his displeasure against the constant paparazzi attention and told IANS, “I can't say I feel kindly about their presence, because 10 people lounging about outside your house waiting for a shot of your kid is disturbing to say the least.” Saif had also requested the photographers, "Please don't stalk Taimur. He is not a star. He is just a child."</p>
      <p>Speaking about the media attention surrounding her toddler, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kareena-Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a> Khan had told IANS, "Looking at the media, looking at those lights..wondering what media is doing. Sometimes they cross the line..especially when comes to Taimur. What he is eating ? where he is going ?...media is constantly following him. Once in a while it is fine, but everyday? He is just a two-year-old kid. One should allow that person to live his life."</p>
