      <p>BANGKOK — Pope Francis has called for migrants to be welcomed and for women and children to be protected from exploitation, abuse and enslavement as he began a busy two days of activities in Thailand.</p>
      <p>Francis pleaded for action against one of the region’s greatest scourges — human trafficking to fuel the forced labour and sex trade industries — as he opened a weeklong visit to Asia on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He praised the Thai government’s efforts to fight human trafficking in a speech at host Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s offices. But he appealed for greater international commitment to protect women and children “who are violated and exposed to every form of exploitation, enslavement, violence and abuse.”</p>
      <p>He called for ways to “uproot this evil and to provide ways to restore their dignity.”</p>
