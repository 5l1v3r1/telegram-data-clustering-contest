      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- The New York Department of Health has confirmed a second death in the state linked to vaping.</p>
      <p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo released a statement that said the person who died was a man in his 30's from Manhattan with a reported history of using e-cigarettes and vaping products.</p>
      <p>Cuomo said the Department of Health is continuing its investigation into the cause of these illnesses.</p>
      <p>"We are taking every step possible to combat this crisis on the state level, but the federal government needs to take action now," Cuomo said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://abc7ny.com/health/17-year-old-bronx-boy-is-first-vaping-death-in-ny/5603007/">first vaping-related death</a> occurred on October 4, involving a 17-year-old teenager from the Bronx. The state said the teen had been hospitalized in early September for a respiratory illness related to vaping.</p>
      <p>The Governor said his message to the public remains unchanged, "If you don't know what you're smoking, don't smoke it."</p>
