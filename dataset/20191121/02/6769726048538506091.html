      <p>AMANA Living is incredibly proud of its 200 volunteers who generously give their time to enriching the lives of more than 5800 residents and clients.</p>
      <p>The not-for-profit aged care provider is always looking for new people to join the volunteering team.</p>
      <p>Currently, Amana Living is recruiting for volunteers at Peter Arney Home in Salter Point, Thomas Scott Hotel in Camillo, James Brown Care Centre in Osborne Park and Lady McCusker Home in Duncraig</p>
      <p>There is a huge range of opportunities available that can be tailored to your personal interests.</p>
      <p>If you love socialising, get involved with Amana Living’s full program of activities.</p>
      <p>You will help staff with activities like arts and crafts, group exercise sessions, quizzes, games, music and special events.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, brighten the day of residents by popping in to have a friendly chat.</p>
      <p>Enjoy a cuppa together or go for a walk in the garden and make a real difference to someone who may not get many visitors or emotional support.</p>
      <p>The organisation also runs social outings which sees residents and clients going on trips across Perth.</p>
      <p>Volunteers help older people get the most out of these outings, encouraging participation, conversation and interaction with others.</p>
      <p>If you enjoy physical activity, there is also the chance to lead a Men’s Shed group or assist with gardening.</p>
      <p>An opportunity unique to Lady McCusker Home is the No-One Dies Alone Companion (NODAC).</p>
      <p>This special role involves spending time with residents as they approach the end of their life.</p>
      <p>It can include holding a conversation, reading to them, ensuring a calm environment and providing comfort and specialist training is provided.</p>
      <p>You do not need formal qualifications to volunteer at <a href="https://www.amanaliving.com.au/">Amana Living</a>, you just need to be willing, compassionate, friendly and respectful.</p>
      <p>All volunteers receive training and ongoing support.</p>
      <p>To start your volunteering journey, email <a href="mailto:volunteers@amamaliving.com.au">volunteers@amamaliving.com.au</a> or call 9424 6335.</p>
