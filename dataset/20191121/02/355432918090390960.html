      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) doubled down on her pledge to not give diplomatic posts to big donors during Wednesday night’s debate. </p>
      <p>“I’ve taken a pledge. Anyone who gives a big donation, don’t ask to be an ambassador. I ask everyone running for president to join me in that, and not a single person has so far,” Warren said.</p>
      <p>Her answer came in the wake of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a>’s <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471359-five-bombshells-from-explosive-sondland-testimony">bombshell testimony</a> earlier in the day as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. </p>
      <p>“How did Ambassador Sondland get there?” Warren asked, adding that his only qualification was writing a “check for a million dollars.”</p>
      <p>Warren <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/450896-warren-pledges-not-to-give-diplomatic-posts-to-donors">announced her pledge</a> to not give ambassador posts to wealthy donors in June when she unveiled a plan to improve the State Department. </p>
      <p>She said Wednesday that she hopes other 2020 Democratic candidates will join her in the pledge after Sondland's testimony. </p>
      <p>Sondland, a Republican megadonor, testified Wednesday that there was a clear quid pro quo in Trump’s interactions with Ukraine. He had previously denied that Trump leveraged a White House meeting and military aid in return for investigations into Trump’s political rivals.</p>
