      <h1>Biden: Impeachment hearings show 'Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:31:50+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/julia-manchester" target="_blank">Julia Manchester</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> on Wednesday said that he learned from the impeachment hearings on Capitol Hill that <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> and Russian President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> do not want him to be the Democratic presidential nominee. </p>
      <p>"I've learned something from these impeachment trials — I've learned that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee," Biden told the audience at the fifth Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta. </p>
      <p>"Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president," he added. </p>
      <p>The former vice president continued to push his electability argument, saying that he is the candidate with the best chance of beating Trump one-on-one. </p>
      <p>A number of polls have shown Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html">defeating Trump</a> in a head-to-head match-up in key battleground states. </p>
      <p>Biden's comments follow the second day of public testimony this week in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Wednesday saw bombshell testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a>, who confirmed that Trump pressured Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, by dangling a meeting and a phone call with the country's new president. </p>
      <p>Sondland also said that Trump's personal attorney, <a href="https://thehill.com/people/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, told U.S. officials in Ukraine that he wanted a public statement from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “committing to investigations of Burisma and the 2016 election.”</p>
