      <p>Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has recently been in the news for constantly featuring in the conversation of Salman Khan and the housemates of the Colors TV’s reality show <i>Bigg Boss. </i>However, this week, it was the turn of both Aishwarya and her ex-lover Salman to find a mention on the popular quiz show <i>Kaun Banega Crorepati, </i>hosted by the former’s father-in-law Amitabh Bachchan. While asking a question about his daughter-in-law, Bachchan also urged the contestant to watch Aishwarya’s debut film.</p>

      <p>The question on Aishwarya read, “Who made a debut as the lead actress in a movie titled ‘Aishwarya?’ The options were Aishwarya Rai, Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra and Sonam Kapoor. While reading out the question, Bollywood megastar said, “The film’s name is Aishwarya. Don’t take it otherwise (don’t think of my daughter-in-law).” This evoked laughter from the contestant and the members of the audience.</p>
      <p>The correct answer was Deepika Padukone, who had acted in the famous Kannada film in 2006 to kickstart her journey as an actress.</p>
      <p>The contestant from Rajasthan answered it incorrectly prompting Bachchan to explain that Aishwarya Rai’s debut film was 1997 film <i>Iruvar </i>directed by Mani Ratnam, who also cast Aishwarya and her husband Abhishek Bachchan in <i>Guru </i>later.</p>
      <p>“This was not the first film of Aishwarya Rai. That was <i>Iruvar, </i>which was made in Tamil. Mani Ratnam had made that film. That was a really nice film. Do watch it some time,” Bachchan told the contestant. The KBC host also went on to explain that Priyanka’s debut film was <i>Thamizhan, </i>while Sonam had made her film debut with Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s <i>Saanwariya </i>opposite Ranbir Kapoor.</p>
      <p>The other highlight of KBC was a question on Salman Khan and his former love interest Katrina Kaif as Bachchan asked, “Arrange these films starring Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif in chronological order of their release.” They films were <i>Tiger Zinda Hai, Bharat, Ek Tha Tiger </i>and <i>Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya. </i></p>
      <p>Aishwarya Rai had also featured earlier on KBC when a contestant praised her eyes prompting Bachchan to playfully say that he was <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/amitabh-bchchans-epic-reaction-to-kbc-contestants-comments-on-daughter-in-law-aishwarya-rais-eyes/270288/">unhappy</a> about not being praised for his own eyes.</p>
