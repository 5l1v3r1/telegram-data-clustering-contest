      <h1>Michael ‘Venom’ Page says referee Dan Miragliotta apologized for Bellator 227 behavior</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Dan Miragliotta let his emotions get the better of him at Bellator 227, as the veteran referee called Michael ‘Venom’ Page a ‘piece of sh-t’ after his first-round knockout victory of Richard Kiely at 3Arena in Dublin, Ireland this past September.</p>
      <p>Page later declared that Miragliotta wouldn’t be allowed to officiate any of his fights going forward but, after a recent friendly encounter with Miragliotta in New York, ‘MVP’ appears to have made amends with the referee.</p>
      <p>Speaking on a recent edition of <a href="https://apple.co/331HXOy">MMA Fighting’s Eurobash podcast</a>, Page revealed that he and Miragliotta are now on good terms after the Muay Thai instructor apologized for his unprofessional behavior at Bellator 227.</p>
      <p>“I was in New York the other day and I spoke to Dan,” Page told <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/19/20972191/michael-page-claims-dan-miragliotta-apologized-for-bellator-dublin-incident">Peter Carroll</a>.</p>
      <p>“He came up to me and he apologized for…just the whole thing. We had a nice discussion so for me, that episode is now past; it’s old news now. That’s all I said I wanted, I wanted to have a face to face with him. All respect to him, he came up to me and we’ve squashed that. It’s just a thing of the past now.</p>
      <p>“For me now, it’s a full stop on the situation. I don’t care to go over specifics. That would probably keep us on bad terms because we’d probably end up disagreeing on something. I appreciate the fact that he came over and apologized for any bad blood and me feeling negative about him in any way. I just accepted that for what it is. We shook hands and we’ll move on from there.”</p>
      <p>Page will return to this cage this Saturday, Nov. 23 at to take on Giovanni Melillo in the Bellator London II main event at London’s SSE Arena.</p>
