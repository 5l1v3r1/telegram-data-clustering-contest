      <p>NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The federal agencies that make and enforce offshore oil and gas leases say they’ll encourage new wells in shallow Gulf of Mexico waters by allowing some reduced-royalty or even royalty-free production if owners can prove they need it.</p>
      <p>Some $20 billion worth of oil and gas may go untapped without changes described in a report issued Tuesday, according to the heads of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which makes the leases, and the Bureau of Safety and Enforcement.</p>
      <p>The number of wells drilled in shallow water has fallen 89 percent over the past 10 years, “and approximately 100 platforms a year are being removed with no new platforms being installed,” a joint press release said.</p>
      <p>The Center for American Progress and an environmental group, the Center for Biological Diversity, both called the changes a giveaway to the petroleum industry.</p>
      <p>“These companies signed a contract with taxpayers and this is giving them a way out, to pay less than what is owed to taxpayers,” said Matt Lee-Ashley, senior director of environmental strategy and communications at the Center for American Progress.</p>
      <p>Recent shallow-water leases have royalties of 12.5%, the legal minimum, with an 18.75% royalty for deepwater leases — those in more than 200 meters (656 feet) of water. Those signed earlier, in either area, can have either of those rates or 16.67%.</p>

      <p>The agencies are providing a new, bigger potential break for shallow-water wells. In addition, the enforcement bureau can now consider requests for a break on royalties on new drilling rather than only on an entire lease. The rules take effect immediately, safety and enforcement spokeswoman Eileen Angelico said.</p>
      <p>She said “specialty royalty relief” is nothing new but has been a little-used program. She wouldn’t speculate on future use.</p>
      <p>The big change is a larger interest rate, called a discount rate, used to compute the value of expected income and spending for shallow-water wells. The previous rate was 15% for all wells; the new 25% rate applies only to those in shallow water.</p>
      <p>U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) had asked Interior Secretary David Bernhardt in early September for royalty relief and other policies to encourage shallow-water drilling.</p>
      <p>“Increased shallow water drilling increases production, which increases federal royalty payments, and creates more American and Louisiana jobs,” he said at the time. He did not return a call Wednesday for comment but was among several senators and congress members who contributed enthusiastic comments for the federal press release.</p>
