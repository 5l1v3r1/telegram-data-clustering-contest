      <p>“I’ve said all along, especially over the last two or three seasons even thought I’m getting on a bit and the end is near, I’ve been enjoying my football thoroughly.</p>
      <p>“I’m playing a different style of football in the last couple of years, now we have a lot of younger and inexperienced players.</p>
      <p>“In a way that’s given me a new lease of life in footy. There’s a lot of things to think about, the kids are growing up and we’ve got a lot of things on.”</p>
