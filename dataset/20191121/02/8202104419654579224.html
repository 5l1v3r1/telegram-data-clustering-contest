      <h3>The board of TCU Place is asking Saskatoon city council to give “special consideration” to a new downtown convention centre at budget deliberations next week.</h3>
      <p>Board president Jennifer Pereira and board member Brian Bentley have written a letter asking city council to consider a new convention centre among its capital priorities.</p>
      <p>The letter says the facility should be a priority given the economic impact of the current facility, which opened in 1968.</p>
      <p>There’s no mention of a specific price for the new convention centre in the letter, but a study into the future of TCU Place and the SaskTel Centre arena and concert venue released last year pegged the cost at between $57.1 million and $88 million.</p>
      <p>“As indicated above, the economic impact of a convention centre is substantial,” the letter says. “A decline in activity due to aging infrastructure is a risk to these impacts that must not be overlooked.”</p>
      <p>TCU Place adds $27 million a year to the local economy, the letter adds.</p>
      <p>The 2018 study found that both SaskTel Centre and TCU Place were outdated and that city hall should consider replacements downtown, including the possibility of a combined facility. A combined facility is estimated to cost $330 million to $375 million.</p>
      <p>City hall is engaged in determining the best location for a downtown entertainment district in which a new arena would be located. The letter says the TCU Place board will make a pitch to be included in the district.</p>
      <p>Neither a new arena nor a new convention centre is included in city hall’s debt forecast.</p>
      <p>The TCU Place board may have written the letter in response to a request this month by the North Downtown Business Association (NSBA) for city hall to prioritize capital projects like the convention centre.</p>
      <p>The NSBA made that request in response to one of the biggest decisions facing council during this year’s budget talks: whether or not to approve borrowing of $87.5 million by the Saskatoon Public Library to build a new downtown location.</p>
      <p>NSBA executive director Keith Moen has also written to council to express concern that approving the library debt could impede borrowing for projects that NSBA members consider “higher priority.” The letters are included in city budget documents.</p>
      <p>The NSBA generally praises the city’s budget, but also raises a few concerns, such as how investing in new technologies and automation will result in real savings for taxpayers.</p>
      <p>Council begins deliberations on Monday on the city’s first two-year budget covering the years 2020 and 2021. The proposed property tax increases are set at 3.23 per cent and 3.54 per cent.</p>
      <p>The approval of additional Saskatoon police officers would increase the tax hikes in both years.</p>
