      <h1>Brian Cashman may have foreshadowed Jacoby Ellsbury’s Yankees release</h1>

      <p>Jacoby Ellsbury’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/yankees-strongly-consider-releasing-jacoby-ellsbury/">release Wednesday night</a> surprised many in the baseball world, but Yankees general manager Brian Cashman in October hinted his failed $153 million player’s future was on thin ice.</p>
      <p>Asked whether the oft-injured Ellsbruy could return in 2019 to fill in for Aaron Hicks (Tommy John surgery), <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/yankees-strongly-consider-releasing-jacoby-ellsbury/">Cashman told reporters</a>: “It’s hard to say based on how things have played out. Right now he’s not someone in a position health-wise where I can answer anything in the affirmative.”</p>
      <p>One month later the Yankees cut ties with the 36-year-old Ellsbury as part of their 40-man roster shuffle, which also saw the oft-<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/greg-birds-time-with-yankees-is-also-over/">injured Greg Bird designated for assignment</a>.</p>
      <p>Top prospects, center fielder Estevan Florial and pitcher Deivi Garcia, headlined a group of seven minor leaguers added to the roster.</p>
      <p>The Yankees owe Ellsbury $21 million for the 2020 season and a $5 million buyout on a $21 million option for 2021.</p>
      <p>Ellsbury hasn’t played since the 2017 ALCS, and played just 520 games in pinstripes after leaving Boston as a free agent in 2013 to sign a seven-year deal with the Yankees. Most recently Ellsbury has been recovering from plantar fasciitis.</p>
