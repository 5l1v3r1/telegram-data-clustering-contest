      <p>INGLEWOOD, Calif. (KABC) -- The Los Angeles Philharmonic is bringing the Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles to Inglewood.<br/><br/>"I think something like YOLA is something that has not existed in Inglewood yet," Dalanie Harris, YOLA alum said.<br/><br/>YOLA serves over 1,200 young musicians across Los Angeles. The new Judith and Thomas L. Beckmen YOLA Center at Inglewood will be the first permanent, purpose-built facility for YOLA.<br/><br/>"We also really work with the young people and with the schools," YOLA's vice president of learning Elsje Kibler-Vermaas said, "And through YOLA we feel we can really contribute that way by providing free and really intensive music instruction."<br/><br/>YOLA alum Liliana Morales said Inglewood is a community YOLA is reaching out to and she's excited to see the program expand its reach.<br/><br/>"We're able to have a greater impact on LA as a whole because we're making sure that all the communities are being represented," Morales said.<br/><br/>Slated to open fall of 2020, the 25,000 square foot center will feature a stage and auditorium able to seat up to 250 people. The hall will be able to separate into two rehearsal spaces in order to accommodate YOLA needs.<br/><br/>Frank Gehry, the architect who designed the Walt Disney Concert Hall, developed the design for this new center that will operate as a hub for YOLA.<br/><br/>"For YOLA to have a space that's designed by such a world-renowned architect and to have all the acoustics be perfect for making music is really inspiring to the community," Morales said. "Because it shows that there's a lot of dedication and effort being put into this project."<br/><br/>Inglewood native and YOLA alum Dalanie Harris thinks this is a great opportunity to inspire new artists through classical music.<br/><br/>"I think it's a really exciting place that has a lot of people who would be interested in this opportunity and also a lot of talent that has been untapped," Harris said<br/><br/><b>Follow Ashley on social media:<br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/abc7AshleyM/">Facebook.com/abc7ashleym</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/abc7ashleym">Twitter.com/abc7ashleym</a><br/><a href="https://www.instagram.com/abc7ashleym/">Instagram.com/abc7ashleym</a></b></p>
