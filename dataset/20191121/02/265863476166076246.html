      <p>According to a report from PageSix.com, DJ Khaled held up traffic this week while in Miami. The producer was spotted in a golf cart in the middle of the road a source explained.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, the producer was smoking a cigar and driving his golf cart down Alton Road as cars were behind him.</p>
      <p>A spectator who spoke with the outlet wasn’t pleased with his behavior at all, stating that it was “f*cking rude,” adding that Mr. Khaled clearly didn’t have any concern for others. The source added that the producer was smoking a cigar and looked like he didn’t have a “care in the world.”</p>
      <p>Page Six claims he/she was one of many people who were vociferously honking the horn at him. A representative speaking on the producer’s behalf refused to comment on the matter. Reportedly, the DJ drives the golf cart whenever he takes his son to school.</p>

      <p>This wouldn’t be the first time Mr. Khaled has sparked controversy. Following the release of his latest record, The Father Of Asahd, the producer reportedly went into his record label’s executive office and was furious that the album never went to number one as he wanted.</p>
      <p>With that said, DJ Khaled has a lot of good things going for him at the moment. The DJ’s wife, Nicole Tuck, is currently pregnant with their second child. The 43-year-old wrote in a post on the 12th of September that God was the “greatest.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Khaled said before his social media followers that his main goal in life was to “inspire the world,” and have a legacy. The DJ added that around three years ago, he found out his wife was pregnant with their first son, and he knew something great was coming.</p>
      <p>The producer explained that his following two albums were some of his biggest records to date. Khaled went on to announce that his wife was with another child. In another video posted to Instagram, the Louisiana native shared himself looking at an ultrasound, telling Asahd that it was his brother in his mother’s stomach.</p>
