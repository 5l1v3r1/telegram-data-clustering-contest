      <h1>Panchkula civic chief: Need duty magistrate, police cover during anti-encroachment drives</h1>
      <h2>The letter was sent as a follow-up to a discussion held between senior officials and Speaker Gian Chand Gupta of various department on November 13, regarding finding solutions to the issue of encroachments, said sources.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:54:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/pallavi-singhal/" target="_blank">Pallavi Singhal</a></address>
      <p>In a letter sent to various senior officials of Panchkula including the deputy commissioner, administrator HSVP and deputy commissioner of police, municipal commissioner, Rajesh Jogpal has requested the appointment of a duty magistrate and asked for deployment of enough police personnel to remove encroachments in the city.</p>
      <p>The letter was sent as a follow-up to a discussion held between senior officials and Speaker Gian Chand Gupta of various department on November 13, regarding finding solutions to the issue of encroachments, said sources.</p>
      <p>“Please refer to discussions held regarding removal of encroachments in the form of rehries/phadis on the road, footpath, parking areas, verandas et al causing obstruction to traffic and pedestrian movement in various sectors and villages in the municipal area of Panchkula MC, and urban estate Panchkula,” said the letter.</p>
      <p>Asked about the number of drives that could be conducted and the time period for the same, MC Commissioner Rajesh Jogpal refused to comment.</p>
      <p>Indicating the stringent steps Panchkula MC will take as part of the drive, the letter further said, “In this regard as agreed, a joint team of HSVP, police and MC along with adequate police force will carry out such encroachment drive in Panchkula M C area. It is requested to appoint a duty magistrate and provide adequate police force including lady police staff on the dates (multiple dates as the drive needs to be continuous so as to be effective) as convenient to magistrate, police and HSVP. Such dates may please be conveyed to the MCP and HSVP timely so that the drive can be carried out repeatedly in the MC area by MC Panchkula and HSVP authorities.”</p>
      <p>While the law prevents removal of any vendors without carrying out a survey and providing the eligible ones a designated site for vending, Jogpal had before the Punjab and Haryana High Court on October 16 taken a stand that the corporation is not touching any of the street vendors who do not fall in the exception carved out in the stand taken previously before the court. In the previous stand, the corporation had undertaken that “none of the street vendors shall be uprooted, unless they park their vehicles/rehris for carrying on their business at a place which is parking area or hinders traffic and pedestrian movement.”</p>
      <p>The vendors have been allowed to carry on their work in an orderly fashion as the city has no dedicated vending zone. Work on building one in Sector 19 of the city is underway.</p>
      <p>Sources said another meeting regarding various issues of top officials with the Speaker at the Vidhan Sabha has been scheduled for Thursday.</p>
