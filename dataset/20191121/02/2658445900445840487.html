      <p>The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) yesterday inaugurated a 26-member committee to develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) among stakeholders to address financial fraud via the telecom platforms.</p>
      <p>Its Executive Vice Chairman Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta said the step the commission took in collaboration with major stakeholders was aimed at protecting over 150 million Nigerians currently in the nation’s financial system.</p>
      <p>Members of the committee were drawn from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the NCC, the Federal Competition and Consumers Protection Commission, the National Inter-Bank Settlement System and the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC).</p>
      <p>Others are: the telecom service providers, the banks, the security agencies, comprising the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the police, and Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NIFU) – and the Federal Ministry of Justice.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the inauguration of the committee at the NCC headquarters annex at Mbora in Abuja, Prof. Danbatta said he had the responsibility to quickly come out with an MoU from the resolutions of the stakeholders in the last meeting to tackle the menace of e-fraud in the country.</p>
      <p>The executive vice chairman, who was represented by the Executive Commissioner, Stakeholders Management of the NCC, Adeleke Adewolu, said: “Nigeria has indeed witnessed tremendous growth in communications penetration that has enhanced the provision of broadband services by all major players in the industry through one technology or the other.”</p>
      <p>As at September 2019, Nigeria had achieved 35.40 per cent broadband penetration, he added.</p>
      <p>Prof. Danbatta regretted that “the malevolent use of this technology has become a growing concern in the industry, especially in the area of financial fraud”.</p>

      <p>He said due to various technological improvements in the financial and telecoms systems, the mobile channels have been seized by cyber-criminals as a new avenue for fraud, while mobile apps have become easy for hackers and cyber-criminals to hijack or corrupt for fraud-related purposes.</p>
      <p>“Phishing tactics and social engineering ploys, such as the illegal SIM swap, are part and parcel of the online fraud mechanism, regardless of whether the transactions are conducted via mobile phone, desktop browser, or point of presence,” Danbatta said.</p>
      <p>He added: “Recent data released by Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA) revealed that over 150 million Nigerians are included in the financial system. This is a massive population that may be vulnerable to financial fraud at any time.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, Customer Service and Fraud Operations teams in banks and mobile network operators arguably need tighter processes and guidelines on how to detect potentially fraudulent activities.</p>
      <p>“It is to this end that the Commission is in collaborating with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Nigerian Police Force, EFCC, ICPC and other relevant agencies in the fight against e-fraud.”</p>
