      <h1>Soaring rates of essentials leave Punjab authorities baffled</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:45:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5853/imran-adnan/" target="_blank">Imran Adnan</a></address>
      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>Following the manifold increase in seasonal vegetable and essential commodity prices, the local administration has been awoken from its deep slumber and has launched a crackdown against hoarding/profiteering.</p>
      <p>The Punjab Chief Minister, on Tuesday, also expressed his extreme displeasure over the failure to control the price mechanism. In response, the price control magistrates launched an action against hoarding and profiteering. However, no major change was witnessed in seasonal commodity prices on the first day of raids.</p>
      <p>Officials statistics released by the Lahore Division commissioner’s office highlighted that the district administration check 1,510 shops in 170 different markets in Lahore Division over the past 24 hours. The commissioner highlighted that price control magistrates have been sent to markets across the provincial capital. “A crackdown has been initiated against hoarding, profiteering and the artificial price hike.</p>
      <p>Price control magistrates imposed Rs500,000 penalty on profiteers across the Lahore Division, of which Rs175,000 fines were imposed in Lahore district alone. Similarly, Rs38,000 penalties were imposed in Sheikhupura, Rs138,000 in Nankana and Rs78,000 in Kasur.</p>
      <p>Price control magistrates also registered 46 cases and arrested 38 persons. In total 238 raids and 25 FIRs were lodged in Lahore, eight in Kasur, 12 in Nankana and one in Sheikhupura district.</p>
      <p>Official price data collected by the Punjab Agriculture Marketing Information Services (AMIS) indicated that tomato produce reaching the vegetable markets of Lahore was sold at Rs180 a kilogramme, while open market survey shows that it was being traded at Rs320-350 a kilogramme at retail. Similar is the case of other seasonal vegetables, as onions are being sold at Rs120-130, peas Rs140, capsicum Rs250 and lady finger Rs120-140 a kilogramme in different areas of the city. Citizens complained that there was hardly any vegetable in the market below Rs100 a kilogramme.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Express Tribune, Punjab Agriculture Department Director General Dr Anjum Buttar said vegetable prices, including tomato and onion, are under stress owing to crop damage and late sowing due to poor weather conditions.</p>
      <p>He said consumers have to face a little difficulty due to the price hike, but it was a positive thing that tomato production increased by 200,000 tonnes and reached 600,000 tonnes after a trade ban with India over the past couple of years.</p>
      <p>He highlighted that the country saved around Rs13 billion on vegetable imports, which is directly benefiting the local farmer.</p>
      <p>Responding to a question, tomato harvesting is about to start in Sindh, following which tomato prices will come down to an affordable level. Last year, tomato was available for Rs100-110 a kilogram in retail during November.</p>
      <p>He also highlighted that Pakistan has imported some 4,500 tonnes of tomato from Iran to ease prices in the local market. Since it is a perishable commodity and new crop is around the corner, it is not feasible to flood the local market with imported commodities.</p>
      <p>Speaking about other vegetable prices, he indicated that most vegetables were sown at temperatures between 18-25 degrees Centigrade, but weather conditions were not favourable this season. Onion prices are being jacked up because there are reports that Pakistani produce is being smuggled to India as the neighbouring country’s crop was badly damaged this year due to rains and change in weather patterns. India also refused Bangladesh, which is a permanent onion importer for India.</p>
      <p>He underlined that the prices of most vegetables will come down in the coming month with the arrival of new crops. Tomato, onion, spinach and other local vegetables will be available at affordable rates at the local market. “Right now supply is limited and that’s why prices have skyrocketed,” he concluded.</p>
      <p>Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, on Tuesday, presided over a meeting of the provincial taskforce on price control and expressed his strong indignation over the failure to take effective steps.</p>
      <p>He underlined that there was no use talking and the rates of essential items should be reduced. He directed strict legal action against elements involved in the price hike and made it clear that lip-service would work no longer. “Giving relief to the masses is our joint responsibility,” he added.</p>
