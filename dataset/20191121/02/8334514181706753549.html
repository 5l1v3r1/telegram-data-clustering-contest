      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer said on Wednesday he had no involvement with the issue of military aid to Ukraine, a key point in the impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to an interview.</p>
      <p>Asked on Blaze TV if he ever discussed the U.S. aid, withheld by the Trump administration over the summer, with American diplomats, Giuliani said: “The reality is the whole issue of military aid didn’t come up until I finished the assignment they gave me. I never discussed military aid with them.”</p>
