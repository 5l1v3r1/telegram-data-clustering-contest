      <h1>Zac Efron Is Starring In A New Series Called ‘Killing Zac Efron’, Which Sounds Nice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:54:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:54</time> by <a rel="author">By Steffanie Tan</a></address>
      <p><b>Zac Efron</b>, having dabbled in a range of different genres since his <i>High School </i>days, has a new series coming out. This time it’s a survival adventure series and it’s – I shit you not – called <i>Killing Zac Efron. </i></p>
      <p>Efron will star and executive produce the show, which will stream on Quibi – a relatively new American short-form video platform for phones.</p>
      <p>I am very confused by the title but the premise makes it sound like some intense Bear Grylls, Man Vs Wild shit.</p>
      <p>The official synopsis is as follows, according to the presser: “In <i>Killing Zac Efron, </i>Zac heads deep into the jungle of a remote island to carve his own name in expedition history. Zac is going all-in, falling off the grid for 21 days with nothing but basic gear, a guide partner and a will to survive.”</p>
      <p>Oof.</p>
      <p>I mean there was that time Efron went on a very normal and not at all dangerous 48-hour adventure with Bear Grylls himself on <i>Running Wild, </i>so this isn’t exactly a surprise.</p>
      <p>Efron literally jumped out of a helicopter with Grylls for fun. Normal.</p>

      <p>Efron said he tends to thrive “under extreme circumstances” and always seeks out opportunities that challenge him on every level.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to explore any uncharted territory and discover what unexpected adventure awaits!” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>I mean, they’re absolutely not going to kill him – surely not, but I think it’s more about the intensity than anything else. Hopefully there’ll be a way for us Aussies to watch it… that isn’t completely illegal. Ah well, c’est la vie.</p>
      <p>On a related note, I’m still slightly off Zac Efron after his role as <b>Ted Bundy </b>in <i>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile. </i>But that will absolutely go away if he makes the right damn choice and reprises his role in <i>The Greatest Showman 2, </i>which is happening by the way.</p>
