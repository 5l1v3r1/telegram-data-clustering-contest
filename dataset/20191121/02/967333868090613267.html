        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Prime Minister Ranil Wickeremesinghe announced his resignation earlier in the day, claiming that the decision was made to respect the mandate given to Rajapaksa at the presidential election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sri Lanka's new president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, will name former president and elder brother Mahinda as the countryâ€™s next prime minister - hours after Wickeremesinghe announced that he was stepping down from the post. The two brothers are credited with ending a decades-long civil war by crushing the Tamil Tigers a decade ago.</p>
      <blockquote>Government spokesman Vijayananda Herath said Rajapaksa will assume the duties of premier soon after incumbent Wickremesinghe steps down on Thursday morning.</blockquote>
      <p>Wickeremesinghe resigned from the post after opposition presidential candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the presidential election on 17 November, with thumping support across the nation with over <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911181077337907-gotabaya-rajapaksa-sworn-in-as-sri-lankas-7th-president-five-ministers-of-previous-govt-resign/">52% of the total votes cast.</a></p>
      <p>Over a dozen members of the cabinet have resigned and the new president has indicated that a 15-member cabinet will take charge until next year's parliamentary election.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former defence secretary of Sri Lanka, was sworn in for a five-year term as the island nation's seventh president on 18 November, two days after winning election to the office. He replaces Maithripala Sirisena in the post.</p>
