      <p>The main card for the upcoming Combate Americas pay-per-view featuring <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/52/tito-ortiz">Tito Ortiz</a> against Alberto “El Patron” Rodriguez has been finalized with the addition of a new bout just announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Combate Americas officials announced Levy Marroquin will face off with Enrique Gonzalez in a featherweight bout that will join the main card for the show taking place in McAllen, Texas.</p>
      <p>The card officially titled “Tito vs. Alberto — What Side Are You On?” goes down on Dec. 7 from the Payne Arena with Ortiz returning from retirement to “El Patron”, who is a former WWE superstar previously performing under the name “Alberto Del Rio”.</p>
      <p>“El Patron” was also an active mixed martial artist during much of his professional wrestling career including a notable fight against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/24/mirko-filipovic">Mirko Cro Cop</a> in PRIDE when he competed under the name Dos Caras Jr. He suffered a first round knockout in that fight.</p>
      <p>“El Patron” hasn’t fought since 2010 and he currently stands with a 9-5 record overall.</p>
      <p>As for Ortiz, he’s coming off a knockout victory over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/489/chuck-liddell">Chuck Liddell</a> from the lone Golden Boy MMA card that took place last year.</p>
      <p>Combate Americas also added two more preliminary card fights to the show including Jose Flores vs. Ismael Bonfim and Ricky Palacios vs. Jose Ceja.</p>
