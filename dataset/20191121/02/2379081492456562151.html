      <p>SAN FRANCISCO — Apple Inc and Intel Corp on Wednesday filed an antitrust lawsuit against Softbank Group Corp-owned Fortress Investment Group, alleging the firm stockpiled patents to hold up technology companies with lawsuits.</p>
      <p>The suit follows an earlier case filed by Intel against Fortress in October. Intel withdrew that suit and on Wednesday filed a new version in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with Apple also joining as a plaintiff.
