        <b>US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland’s Wednesday testimony on Capitol Hill left many speculating about US President Trump’s alleged quid pro quo, but it was Trump’s Sharpie-scribbled rebuttal to the impeachment inquiry hearings that seemed to drive the point home.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prior to departing the White House for Texas on November 20, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911211077363534-i-prosecuted-sex-predators-kamala-harris-slams-donald-trump-in-new-viral-video/">Trump</a> had some choice words to get off his chest that related to the impeachment inquiry against him and his loose relationship with Sondland - who donated $1 million to 45’s inaugural committee prior to being named chief envoy to the politico-economic bloc.</p>
      <blockquote>“I want nothing, I want nothing,” Trump said, quoting his alleged September 9 conversation with Sondland. “I want no quid pro quo. Tell [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy to do the right thing.”</blockquote>

      <p>Netizens had a lot to say and memes to make after <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911201077354288-next-logical-step-trump-follows-decades-of-us-policy-by-retreating-on-west-bank-settlements/">Trump’s</a> post-hearing notes were blown up and put on display for public consumption.</p>
      <blockquote>Many agreed that Trump’s dating of his call with the ambassador to September 9 was telling, considering Sondland confirmed it was on the same day House Democrats launched their investigation.</blockquote>
