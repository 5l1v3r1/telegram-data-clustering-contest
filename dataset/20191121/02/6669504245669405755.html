        <figcaption>According to the long-range winter forecast for Kamloops and the Okanagan, we should be seeing more temperatures above freezing than below this winter, with sufficient snow at higher elevations to satisfy skiers, snowboarders and snowmobilers.<cite>(JENNIFER STAHN / iNFOnews.ca)</cite></figcaption>

      <p>The long term winter forecast for Kamloops and the Okanagan is looking good, especially when compared to just about anywhere else in the country.</p>
      <p>Weather Network meteorologist Doug Gillham says B.C. weather, in general, is expected to be the envy of the rest of the country this winter with the Interior milder and drier than usual this winter.</p>
      <p>That doesn’t mean there won’t be bouts of winter-like weather, however, Gillham warns.</p>
      <p>“The Okanagan Valley and Kamloops should be close to a typical winter, more likely tipping to the mild side of normal,” he says.</p>
      <p>“There will be periods where that pattern breaks down and there will be times of significant winter weather, but Kamloops and the Okanagan should be thawing more often than freezing,” Gillham says.</p>
      <p>The region should be near normal for snowfall, but in between the snow it is expected there will be extended periods when warmer than normal, and drier than normal conditions prevail. When these periods break down, enough snow should fall to bring levels up to normal.</p>
      <p>“It should present some of the best conditions to get out and enjoy the outdoors,” Gillham says, although he cautions similarity in global weather patterns between now and last year could translate into at least a couple of weeks of “high impact winter weather” in spite of a better overall picture.</p>
      <p>“Last winter was an extreme example, where Kamloops and the Okanagan went from a warmer, drier winter to extreme cold and wet late in the season for an extended period,” he says.</p>
      <p>Gillham says a big factor impacting the weather this winter will be the warm Pacific water sitting off the coast of B.C., known as The Blob.</p>
      <p>“The condition contributes to the jet stream tracking far north to Alaska before sliding down the Rockies. When it does that, it is usually dry and mild in the Interior."</p>
      <p>He says there shouldn't be may Pineapple Express weather systems this winter.</p>
      <p>“Those storms usually bring higher temperatures and rain to alpine areas, which doesn’t help the skiing. We aren’t ruling them out but believe they will figure less significantly in this winter’s mix,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I think this year’s winter forecast for Kamloops and the Okanagan really looks like a skier’s delight."</p>
