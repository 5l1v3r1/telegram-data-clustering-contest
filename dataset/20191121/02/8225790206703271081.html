      <p>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) — A man died after being stabbed with his own knife on a California commuter train while trying to stop the attacker from stealing the shoes of a sleeping passenger, authorities said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>During the confrontation Tuesday in the San Francisco Bay Area, the victim pulled a knife that was wrestled away by the attacker and used to stab him several times, Bay Area Rapid Transit officials said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Officers boarded the train and found Oliver Williams, 49, of Oakland bleeding. He died at the scene.</p>
      <p>Jermaine Jeremiah Brim, 39, of Sacramento was arrested near the Hayward station after he tried to steal a van at a car dealership, authorities said. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Brim had walked away from an area hospital and was listed as a missing person at risk when he wandered into the train system with no shoes on.</p>
      <p>It was unclear if Brim has an attorney who could speak on his behalf.</p>
      <p>“Short of having an officer on that train car, this would’ve been hard to prevent,” BART interim Police Chief Ed Alvarez said. “Both individuals took it upon themselves to start a fight. ... It’s something that unfortunately, it happened and that one man lost his life as a result of it.”</p>
      <p>As a safety precaution, the agency said it will increase the presence of police officers on trains and at station platforms.</p>
      <p>“We are heartbroken that a person has lost his life due to violence on one of our trains,” Robert Powers, the agency’s general manager, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The stabbing follows the death of 18-year-old Nia Wilson, who was stabbed last year in an unprovoked attack on her and her sister in an Oakland BART station.</p>
      <p>John Cowell, a 27-year-old parolee, was found competent to stand trial but his case is in legal limbo. A judge in October agreed to seal a motion by Cowell’s attorney to dismiss the case.</p>
      <p>The family of Wilson claims BART failed in its duty to ensure its customers are safe.</p>
