      <h1>Fact Check: Elizabeth Warren Plans Tax Hikes Far More Than 2 Cents | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Elizabeth Warren misleadingly insisted on Wednesday night that she could pay for her programs with a “two cent” tax hike on the wealth of billionaires.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:51:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:51</time> by <a rel="author">John Carney</a></address>
      <p>“Two cent wealth tax, and we can invest in an entire generation’s future,” Warren said during the Democratic debate.</p>
      <p>Senator Warren has proposed an “<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax">Ultra-Millionaire Tax</a>” that would charge two cents for every dollar of household’s wealth above $50 million. But her tax plans do not stop there.</p>
      <p>Warren would also create a billionaire’s tax of 3 percent on fortunes over $1 billion. And recently she went back to the billionaire piggy bank, proposing an additional 3 percent tax on wealth over $1 billion. So for the ultra-wealthy, it is really a six-cent tax.</p>
      <p>Warren also supports a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/11/20/payroll-tax-hikes/">huge hike in payroll taxes</a>. In her proposals, she has said she would impose a 14.8 percent payroll tax on workers with incomes above $250,000. High-income households would also be hit by a 14.8 percent tax on investment incomes.</p>
      <p>What’s more, Warren would tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for the top 1 percent of households. And she has said she would raise capital gains tax rates and lower the level of wealth that would be hit by the death tax.</p>
