      <h1>German FinanceMin: German exports stabilized, but trade risks remain</h1>

      <p>On Thursday, the German Finance Ministry, in its monthly report, highlighted the risks of global economic slowdown and ongoing trade war while expecting the country’s exports to stabilize by end-Q3 2019, per Reuters.</p>
      <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
      <p>“Export activity regained some momentum toward the end of the third quarter.” </p>
      <p>“Given the weakening global economic momentum and persistent external risks (for trade), exports are likely to continue to develop only moderately.” </p>
      <p>“Record-high employment and rising wages continue to support private consumption and construction in Germany while state spending is giving the economy an additional push.”</p>
