      <p>The fifth Democratic primary debate kicked off Wednesday night, featuring the first all-female panel of moderators of the 2020 campaign cycle.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/rachel-maddow">Rachel Maddow</a>, host of “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC; Andrea Mitchell, host of “Andrea Mitchell Reports” on MSNBC and NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent; Kristen Welker, NBC News White House correspondent; and Ashley Parker, Washington Post White House reporter moderated the debate, which was hosted jointly by MSNBC and The Washington Post.</p>
      <p>In January 2016, Trish Regan and Sandra Smith moderated a Republican presidential debate on the Fox Business Network. Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff of PBS co-moderated a Democratic debate in February 2016, according to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/24/20930316/all-women-moderators-democratic-debate">Vox.</a></p>
      <p>Audiences at home were quick to celebrate the team of women. </p>

      <p>Earlier this year, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced that each debate it holds it will have <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/446258-dnc-requiring-female-moderators-at-every-presidential-debate-report">at least one female moderator.</a></p>
      <p>"We have taken an innovative and inclusive approach to debates so that we reach the widest audience and give our historically large field of candidates a fair chance to make their case to the American people," DNC senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/05/234148/democratic-presidential-debate-info-2020-dnc-female-moderator">told Refinery29</a> at the time of the announcement.</p>
