      <p>A reputed Brooklyn gangbanger was busted with a semiautomatic pistol and an extended magazine by field intelligence officers who executed a search warrant at his apartment Wednesday morning, cops said.</p>
      <p>The suspect, Earl Haile, 25, was arrested at the Albany Houses in Crown Heights when cops found the loaded 9mm pistol at about 11:25 a.m., authorities said.</p>
      <p>Haile, a reputed member of the Albany-Drizzy crew in the public housing complex, was hit with criminal possession of a loaded firearm and criminal possession of an ammo clip, a police source said.</p>
      <p>“This is the result of our ongoing strategy to disrupt gang activity,” Deputy Inspector John Buttacavoli, the commanding officer of the 77 precinct, <a href="https://twitter.com/NYPD77Pct/status/1197290194220785666">wrote on Twitter after the bust</a>.</p>
      <p>Haile has a number of other previous arrests, a police source said, including busts for grand larceny and possession of a forged instrument.</p>
