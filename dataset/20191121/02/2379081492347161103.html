      <h1>Gold edges up on concerns of delay in U.S.-China trade deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:58:58+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:58</time> by <a rel="author">Sumita Layek</a></address>
      <p>Gold prices inched up on Thursday,</p>
      <p>supported by concerns that U.S. bills on Hong Kong could</p>
      <p>increase tensions between the United States and China and delay</p>
      <p>an interim trade deal.</p>
      <p>Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,471.93 per ounce by 0235</p>
      <p>GMT. U.S. gold futures were down 0.1% at $1,472.20 per</p>
      <p>ounce.</p>
      <p>“The main driver in gold currently is the uncertainty about</p>
      <p>the trade deal. There is the possibility that the deal might not</p>
      <p>be completed this year, so that is a key support factor,” said</p>
      <p>John Sharma, an economist with National Australia Bank.</p>
      <p>Completion of a “phase one” trade deal could slide into next</p>
      <p>year, trade experts and people close to the White House said.</p>
      <p>The protracted trade dispute has pushed the precious metal,</p>
      <p>which is considered a safe asset in times of political and</p>
      <p>economic uncertainty, about 14% higher this year.</p>
      <p>Dialing up tensions, the U.S. House of Representatives</p>
      <p>passed two bills to back protesters in Hong Kong and send a</p>
      <p>warning to China about human rights, with President Donald Trump</p>
      <p>expected to sign them into law.</p>
      <p>This comes after China condemned Washington’s interference</p>
      <p>in the Hong Kong affairs and summoned an U.S. embassy official</p>
      <p>to demand that the U.S. stop its meddling.</p>
      <p>“That (Hong Kong bills) could pose challenges to the trade</p>
      <p>deal … there might be some progress because both the countries</p>
      <p>will see there is some benefit to cooperation, but the quality</p>
      <p>and duration (of a deal) is uncertain,” Sharma said.</p>
      <p>Lower global shares and a tad weaker dollar index</p>
      <p>also supported the precious metal.</p>
      <p>Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s October policy</p>
      <p>meeting released on Wednesday offered little guidance on what</p>
      <p>would cause policymakers to change their minds on the interest</p>
      <p>rate outlook.</p>
      <p>The Fed has cut interest rates three times this year. The</p>
      <p>cuts have been positioned as “a mid-cycle adjustment” to help</p>
      <p>shield the U.S. economy from the effects of the U.S.-China trade</p>
      <p>war and slowing global growth, which have hurt manufacturing,</p>
      <p>business investment and exports.</p>
      <p>Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost for holding</p>
      <p>the non-yielding bullion.</p>
      <p>Under investors’ radar now is the U.S. weekly initial</p>
      <p>jobless claims due at 1330 GMT.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, silver shed 0.1% to $17.12 per ounce.</p>
      <p>Silver demand will creep up by 1% this year, reducing global</p>
      <p>oversupply of the metal to the lowest since 2015, consultancy</p>
      <p>Metals Focus said in a report.</p>
      <p>Palladium fell 0.2% to $1,763.66 per ounce and</p>
      <p>Platinum was down 0.2% to $915.20 per ounce.</p>
