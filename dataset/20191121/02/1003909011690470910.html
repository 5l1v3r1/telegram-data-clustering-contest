      <h1>Three city councillors propose major revisions to budget; other councillors skeptical</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:04:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:04</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>A pitch from three city councillors to slash spending on municipal services by five per cent — while excluding cuts to essential services — has been met with skepticism by colleagues who doubt big savings can be found without cuts to the city’s largest departments.</p>
      <p>Councillors Joe Magliocca, Sean Chu and Jeromy Farkas are proposing to find an additional $50 million in cuts in the 2020 budget without touching services such as fire, police, 911 and public transit. The cut would be over and above the $52.5-million in savings that would already be required to freeze taxes next year.</p>
      <p>“It is common sense to focus on essential services and ask all (other city services) to take an average spending reduction of five per cent — it’s not too much to ask for,” Magliocca said at a news conference Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“From cemeteries all the way to parks to staplers and paper clips — we went through line item by line item, every department, and we found where we can reduce five per cent.”</p>
      <p>The group has not identified specific programs or services that could be cut with their proposal, but are suggesting city bureaucrats come up with areas where savings can be found.</p>
      <p>The proposal comes just days ahead of the city’s 2020 budget deliberations where council is expected to toss out a previously approved 3.03 per cent tax hike on homeowners. The remaining two scenarios on the table include a 1.5 per cent hike or a tax freeze.</p>
      <p>Getting to a tax freeze is expected to require $52.5 million in cuts — including an $8.45-million cut to police funding.</p>

      <p>Reacting to the trio’s proposal Wednesday, some city council members were skeptical that deeper cuts could be found that didn’t touch some of the city’s largest departments.</p>
      <p>“It’s a financial fairy tale, what they’ve proposed,” said Coun. Evan Woolley. “It’s important to remember that over 75 per cent of our budget is police, fire and transportation. And so five per cent out of 25 per cent is very incremental and will not help us solve the problem of the (downtown tax shift) or any other — this is pure political gamesmanship.”</p>
      <p>Complicating matters during next week’s budget is the fact that council could also tweak the ratio of property taxes paid by homeowners and businesses <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/council-approves-tax-relief-as-business-owners-descend-on-city-hall">in a bid to tackle Calgary’s downtown tax crisis</a>. Shifting to a 48/52 split — with homeowners paying the larger share of taxes for the first time — could result in taxes being hiked by 6.78 per cent on the typical home.</p>
      <p>For most council members, the tax situation has fuelled a desire to see more budget cuts at city hall. But few are in agreement on where the axe should fall, with some favouring aggressive cuts to operating budgets while others have hinted they’d like to revisit capital spending plans such as council’s <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/live-council-could-decide-fate-of-arena-deal-today">decision to provide $275 million for a new NHL arena</a>.</p>
      <p>The councillors behind the pitch released Wednesday say that slashing non-essential services will help lower taxes for both businesses and residents.</p>
      <p>But one problem with the trio’s proposal is that it would actually require a bigger cut to municipal services than just five per cent to achieve $50 million in savings.</p>
      <p>The current approved 2020 operating budget for non-essential services is about $900 million, according to city data; and a five per cent cut would amount to $45 million, rather than $50 million.</p>
      <p>Some critics have dismissed the proposal as unrealistic and criticized the backers for not proposing specific areas where administration should focus cuts.</p>
      <p>“If you’re going to ask for a rather ludicrous option, then you should come up with some ways of doing it,” Coun. Shane Keating said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“You can’t stand here and say, ‘do this’, offer no solutions, and yet are willing to continually go down this path of slash and burn.”</p>
      <p>Still, the trio behind the proposal sounded optimistic Wednesday that attitudes on council are shifting in their favour.</p>
      <p>Farkas, who was shot down last year when proposing an across-the-board cut to municipal operating budgets, suggested that things could be different this time around. He pointed to a vote at council Tuesday that <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/council-takes-aim-at-union-wages-endorses-private-garbage-collection-pilot">overwhelmingly endorsed a plan to revisit union contracts</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think that based on some of the votes we’ve seen recently on council, other council members are hearing the same thing from their residents,” said Farkas.</p>
      <p>“What’s different this time is Calgarians are bled out, they’re contacting their members of council and I think council doesn’t have a choice except to take a look at very significant course corrections like this.”</p>
