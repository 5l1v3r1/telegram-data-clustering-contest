      <h1>Urban Meyer: The Penn State Game Isn’t A ‘Rivalry’ For Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:45:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Saturday’s Ohio State-Penn State game is a big one for the Buckeyes, but don’t call it a rivalry game. That’s what Urban Meyer is saying, anyway.</p>
      <p>The former Ohio State head coach previewed Saturday’s game on Big Ten Network this evening. He said it might be a rivalry game for Penn State, but it’s not for his Buckeyes.</p>
      <p>“Certainly over the last few years, just because of the quality of team that Penn State is, that’s become a war…my goodness, two very good teams, two very good programs,” Meyer said tonight. “Great players all over the field. It’s become a rivalry in a sense, but not in Ohio State’s – we know which one that is coming up next week.”</p>
      <p>Ohio State has one rival, according to Meyer, and we don’t need to tell you who that is.</p>

      <p>Meyer dominated Penn State during his time at Ohio State, going 6-1 against the Nittany Lions.</p>
      <p>He’s calling for Buckeyes fans to show up in a big way on Saturday morning for his <i>Big Noon Kickoff </i>show.</p>
      <p>“BUCKEYE NATION!” Meyer tweeted. “See you Saturday outside the RPAC starting at 10 a.m. for the Big Noon Kickoff Show.”</p>
