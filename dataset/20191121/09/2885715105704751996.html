      <p>Kamya Punjabi and Shalabh Dang have been dating for close to a year now. Earlier speaking to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a>, the actor had shared, “I am feeling like a 16-year-old. I am so excited about the wedding. I want to get married with complete rituals and yet want to keep it a little low key. Some days I want a destination wedding, the other days I want to just get married in front of Ganpati. There is a lot of confusion about it.”</p>
      <p>Currently, part of Shakti: Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki, Kamya was earlier married to Bunty Negi. She has a daughter from her first marriage. Shalabh, who works in the healthcare industry, also has a son from his previous marriage.</p>
      <p>Talking about what attracted her to Shalabh, the ex-Bigg Boss contestant shared, “Men usually cannot stand strong-headed women but he is very different. He lets me be the way I am. He makes me emotionally secure. This made me fall in love with him. Shalabh has also been very supportive when it comes to our future. I was reluctant about the marriage since we are in two different cities. But Shalabh assured that he will take care of it all.”</p>
      <p>Kamya Punjabi had also shared that the couple plans to shuttle between Delhi and Mumbai to spend time with each other. “Not that I need to work but I love acting and would want to continue till the time my heart is in television. So it’s going to be a lot of traveling in the next year for both of us. Luckily for us, our families have also come forward to assure we have a smoother life post the wedding,” she concluded.</p>
      <p>Wishing Kamya Punjabi and Shalabh Dang a very happy married life.</p>
