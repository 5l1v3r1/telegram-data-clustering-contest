      <p>NEW DELHI: Detained under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) after being accused of having "tremendous potential to create public disorder", former <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Jammu-and-Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a> chief minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Farooq-Abdullah">Farooq Abdullah</a> has been included in a 21-member consultative committee on defence.</p>
      <p>The name of the 81-year-old National Conference leader, in detention at his <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Srinagar">Srinagar</a> home for over 100 days, tops the list of members of the panel headed by Defence Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajnath-Singh">Rajnath Singh</a>.</p>
      <p>The committee's other members include former defence minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, according to a notification issued by Parliamentary Affairs Ministry. Also in the list is controversial BJP MP Pragya Thakur, whose inclusion has been slammed by the Congress party.</p>
      <p>Abdullah was detained on August 5, hours before the Union government scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into two union territories.</p>
      <p>His son and former chief minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Omar-Abdullah">Omar Abdullah</a> and another ex-chief minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mehbooba-mufti">Mehbooba mufti</a> were also detained along with more than 5,000 others across the state.</p>
      <p>Abdullah was slapped with the stringent PSA on September 17 on the eve of a Supreme Court hearing on a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/habeas-corpus">habeas corpus</a> pertaining to his detention filed by MDMK leader Vaiko.</p>
      <p>The National Conference chief and three-term chief minister has been booked under the 'public order' provision of the PSA under which a person can be kept in jail from three-six months without a trial.</p>
      <p>Abdullah, the PSA order stated, "has tremendous potential for creating an environment of public disorder within the district (Srinagar) and other parts of the Valley".</p>
      <p>It also accuses him of being a person seen as fanning the emotions of general masses against the country.</p>
