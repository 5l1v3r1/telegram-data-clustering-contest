      <p>Stephen Colbert tried — and failed — to keep up with some New Zealand All Blacks rugby players in a new <a href="https://www.globaltv.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/">“Late Show”</a> skit.</p>
      <p>Piri Weepu and DJ Forbes, along with Sky TV broadcaster Laura McGoldrick, tried to teach the host how to play their national sport. However, rugby isn’t one of Colbert’s strengths.</p>

      <p>Despite Colbert going up against two pros, he insisted at the start of the clip: “I want you to know I played football for my high school for one day!”</p>
      <p>He even said to Forbes before taking him on the pitch, “Do you want to call your mommy before we do this? Bye-bye, mommy!”</p>

      <p>But, after a day of learning about tackles and scrums, Colbert got defeated and said his quads wouldn’t let him walk off, so he’d have to be carried. Weepu and Forbes kindly obliged.</p>
