      <p>After he shared the video, his fans soon came to his rescue and started correcting him. Comments like, "It's fake video sir..well edited that's all..", "I doubt...computer-generated...old post..", “It's an edited video. Consider perspectives...Things further away should be smaller than the near ones. Here the furthest girl is tallest. How?" started lining up. Well, we love how Big B’s fans always have his back.</p>
