      <h1>Shared-use walking and cycling path on Durdham Down by A4018 dismissed</h1>
      <h2>The plan for the gravel path has been dismissed, but not discarded altogether</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:00:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Plans for a walking and cycling path on Durdham Down have been dismissed by a committee of Bristol councillors and business leaders.</p>
      <p>The 3m-wide path, possibly made of gravel, would have replaced a muddy track in the park that runs alongside the A4018 from Black Boy Hill to the Cote Lane Retirement Village.</p>
      <p>The Downs Committee, which manages The Downs, were asked for their blessing for the proposal ahead of a planning application being submitted by <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a>. </p>
      <p>But members, who represent the council and the Society of Merchant Venturers, voted seven to three to reject the proposal yesterday (November 18).</p>
      <p>The two main objections included the loss of grassland and the creation of a shared-use path just a few feet from a wide pavement already designated for shared use by pedestrians and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/cycling">cyclists</a>.</p>
      <p>But committee members have not discarded the idea of a gravel path beside the A4018 altogether.</p>
      <p>They agreed to ask council officers to explore whether the proposed new path could be reserved for pedestrians and the existing shared-use pavement on the Durdham Down side of the A4018 could be reserved for cyclists.</p>
      <p>The committee had been due to vote on the council's plans for a new path in September but had postponed their decision to find out why the existing pavement could not be upgraded instead.</p>
      <p>Officers concluded it was not suitable for upgrading because it did not meet “current national best practice standards”, according to a report prepared for the committee.</p>
      <p>An officer told the committee that the current arrangement was not safe for children who wanted to cycle and that the point of the new path was to encourage new cyclists and younger inexperienced cyclists.</p>
      <p>But Merchant Venturer Jonathan Baker said the proposal, which is part of wider plans to reduce traffic on the A4018, was “never about children” and that the report was written from a very “pro” position.</p>

      <p>Stoke Bishop councillor Peter Abraham said he thought shared-use paths were “dangerous”, noting it was notoriously difficult to control the speed of cyclists and any toddlers who might be playing on the grass next to the new path.</p>
      <p>Merchant Venturer Tim Ross said: “What I find a bit troublesome is this new path is to be shared-use so what we’re actually going to end up with is two shared-use paths. </p>
      <p>“If I had to choose, and I don’t think it’s an offer on the table at the moment, I think I would be inclined to put cycling on the tarmac surface and have pedestrians walking on the rather nice, new, not-so-muddy path.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/clifton">Clifton</a> councillor Paula O’Rourke, who supports the new path, pointed out the proposal included signage suggesting exactly that but accepted the separation would be difficult to “police”.</p>
      <p>Cabinet member for transport Kye Dudd, who represents Central ward, said: “There’s unofficial cycling as it is on the grass and I think this proposal would improve it. The money’s available to do it.”</p>

      <p>An officer said the committee had already accepted the principle of creating better walking and cycling facilities on The Downs with a framework agreed in 2016.</p>
      <p>But Mr Ross said the Downs Place and Movement Framework was far more “holistic and complex” than the proposal for a single shared-use path.</p>
      <p>Committee members are due to receive a briefing on the framework in January.</p>
      <p>The framework was not progressed because of concerns over funding, the committee heard.</p>
