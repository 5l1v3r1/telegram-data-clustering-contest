      <h1>The restaurant suffering from some 'uneven' cooking which saved itself with a 'humdinger' of a pie</h1>
      <h2>The steak and ale pie was worth returning for alone</h2>

      <p>London pub chain Young’s should be commended for the way it has gone about the careful transformation of Bristol’s landmark riverstation restaurant.</p>
      <p>When it bought the property three years ago, after two decades under independent ownership, there must have been a few worried regulars who thought the former river police station would end up as yet another homogenous pub chain operation.</p>
      <p>It is to their credit that Young’s have treated the riverstation with the kid gloves it deserves and they clearly realised that it’s a special venue and one close to the hearts of many Bristolians.</p>
      <p>Since the takeover, it has been pretty much business as usual in the light-filled upstairs restaurant with its views across the water towards the colourful townhouses of Redcliffe.</p>
      <p>There have been more noticeable changes in the renamed Pontoon bar on the ground floor, which is a lot more informal than the fine dining restaurant upstairs.</p>
      <p>What had been <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/look-inside-top-bristol-restaurant-1690712">the old bar and kitchen at riverstation has been refurbished</a> and named after the docking bay and terrace outside.</p>

      <p>Over the summer, Pontoon was certainly a go-to venue for sun seekers in search of al fresco opportunities, whether it was a leisurely breakfast, weekend brunch, business lunch, romantic dinner or simply drinks in between.</p>
      <p>The new look boasts glazed tiles and wood panels on the walls, toffee-colour leather upholstery and a teal blue colour scheme to reflect the waterside location.</p>
      <p>With its armchairs and sofas, the space looks and feels warmer and it’s more welcoming than before when the hard edges resulted in a more clackety ambience.</p>
      <p>One of the real draws of the Pontoon is the fact it serves its main menu from 12pm through to the evening (and brunch until 4pm).</p>
      <p>As we hurtle towards the December office party season, the work/life balance can start to get out of sync as short days meld into long nights. It’s always useful to find good quality restaurants that serve food in the late afternoon, even if it’s to soak up the booze before carrying on.</p>
      <p>Rushing between a school thing and a gig, I found myself at Pontoon just after 5.30pm on a mid-week afternoon, which is usually a terrible time to hunt down a decent meal in central Bristol. It’s that hinterland between lunch and dinner when most of the best places are either closed or changing staff before the evening session.</p>
      <p>But I wasn’t alone. A couple of women were killing time before a networking event and there were a few clusters of post-work drinkers and solo diners, perhaps refuelling before making the journey home.</p>
      <p>With Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby crooning in the background, there was even an early hint of Christmas in the air and that extended to the food on offer, even though I didn’t spot a festive menu.</p>
      <p>Still, I started with the oh-so-festive turkey and cranberry Scotch egg (£6) which arrived about two minutes later after I ordered it.</p>
      <p>The waiter had assured me it would be served hot rather than cold. He was half right. It could have done with an extra minute in the oven.</p>

      <p>The crisp, crunchy crumb exterior was certainly warmer than the fridge-cold egg in the centre. The minced turkey layer was herby and there was a gentle sweetness from the cranberry that was countered by the salty bacon mayonnaise.</p>
      <h3>'The sides arrived a good five minutes later than the pie'</h3>
      <p>There were certainly no temperature issues with a main course of steak and ale short crust pie (£14.50). Plumes of steam emerged from the shiny pastry lid as soon as I cut into it and the chunks of steak in the flood of gravy were seriously tender.</p>
      <p>It was surrounded by diced swede and carrot with a nice bite to them and strips of squeaky Savoy cabbage in a moat of rosemary-scented ale and onion gravy so dark brown and luscious that it would make a decent substitute for Creosote when painting the garden fence before winter sets in.</p>
      <p>The sides arrived a good five minutes later than the pie, which was pretty inexcusable considering how few people were actually eating at the time. This was the quiet period, the calm before the storm.</p>
      <p>The skinny fries (£3.50) were crisp, salty and greaseless and the dish of Brussels sprouts, chestnuts and orange (£3) was large enough to feed a family on December 25. A few of the sprouts were hard enough to last a vigorous round of golf but others were more tender. The chestnuts contributed a nice chew.</p>

      <p>I ordered the vegan sticky toffee pudding (£5.50) really out of curiosity because experience has shown that desserts lacking animal fats and cream are inevitably a dreary and depressing disappointment.</p>
      <p>The cake-like toffee pudding was on the dry side but the caramel sauce was decent enough and the soya caramel ice cream was surprisingly good. I may not have even realised it was vegan had I not known in advance.</p>
      <h3>THE VERDICT:</h3>
      <p>Despite some uneven cooking to start and finish, the meal was saved by the steak and ale pie, which was a humdinger of a main course and worth returning for alone.</p>
