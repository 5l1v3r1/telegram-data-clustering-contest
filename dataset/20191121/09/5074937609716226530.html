      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:52:15+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:52</time> by <a rel="author">Edna A. Quansah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 20, GNA - Ibrahim Tanko, Head Coach of Ghana’s Black Meteors, has congratulated the Young Elephants of Cote D’Ivoire on their victory over Ghana in the ongoing U-23 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Cup at the Cairo International Sports Stadium in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Cote D’Ivoire yesterday snatched an Olympic slot after a painful 3-2 penalty win over Ghana after the game ended 2-2 after extra time.</p>
      <p>Ghana came from behind to draw 2-2 with neighbours, Cote D’Ivoire with goals from captain Yaw Yeboah and Evans Mensah to send the game to extra time which produced no goals.</p>
      <p>After the lotteries of penalties were evoked, it was the Young Elephants who stood tall following  misses from Emmanuel Cudjoe, Evans Mensah, Kwabena Owusu with Emmanuel Lomotey and Samuel Obeng expertly converting theirs for Ghana.</p>
      <p>The Ivorians also missed a kick from Aboubakar Keita but Ishmael Diallo, Hamed Traore and Franck Kouao converted to hand them the win.</p>
      <p>The win means, the Young Elephants would play hosts, Egypt in the finals for the ultimate trophy on Friday, and also join the party in Tokyo, Japan next year for the biggest multi-sport competition.</p>
      <p>Coach Tanko after the painful loss yesterday admitted he faced a tough opponent and saluted his opponent for the win.</p>
      <p>He said his charges have now set sights on the bronze medal to earn Ghana a place at the Olympic Games which has eluded the country in 15 years.</p>
