      <p>A biscuit tin of a double-decker bus which was kept in a kitchen cupboard for decades turned out to be a rare collectors’ item and sold for more than £3,000.</p>
      <p>The Huntley &amp; Palmers tin had been gathering dust for 25 years after its owners, a retired couple, tucked the object away in a cupboard and forgot all about it.</p>
      <p>When the couple moved house they discovered the colourful red and cream tin and took it to an antique valuation event to find out about its history.</p>

      <p>They were left stunned when experts revealed it was a 1929 prized collectors’ item and was worth thousands of pounds.</p>
      <p>The 90-year-old biscuit tin doubles up as a clockwork double decker motor bus destined for London's Liverpool Street complete with passengers and driver.</p>
      <p>The vehicle features pictures of a sassy set of 1920s London commuters together with the driver and a Huntley &amp; Palmers advert for Breakfast Biscuits.</p>

      <p>It was expected to sell for around £1,000 but it eventually fetched £3,100 when it went under the hammer at Hansons Auctioneers on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The couple, who remain anonymous, said: “It’s truly amazing. We’re surprised and delighted by the price it sold for.</p>
      <p>“To say we were absolutely gobsmacked when we first found out it could be worth £1,000 to £1,500 is the understatement of the year – and it sold for even more.</p>

      <p>“We just took it along to a free valuation event with a couple of other items to find out a bit more about it.</p>
      <p>“I’ve kept it in a cupboard for 25 years.</p>
      <p>“It’s come out of its box a couple of times. I inherited it from my mum and she got it from her cousin who used to run a corner shop in the Doncaster area a long time ago.</p>

      <p>"It was found in a cupboard at the shop.</p>
      <p>“We came across it again when we moved house. You put things away and just forget about them.”</p>
      <p>Auctioneer Charles Hanson realised the value of the tin when he examined it an open day event last month.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was amazed when I saw it. It had been tucked away in a cupboard at a shop and still had its original cardboard box.</p>

      <p>"It was made 90 years ago and dates back to the start of the Great Depression in 1929.</p>
      <p>"It’s survived unscathed through numerous world events including the Second World War which lasted from 1939 to 1945.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to the ingenuity of their designs, Huntley &amp; Palmers biscuit tins became as highly prized as the products they contained.</p>

      <p>"Now they are collectors’ items.</p>
      <p>"From miniature replicas of vehicles to tins that could be re-used as household objects, the firm came up with ways to make their biscuit tins extra special.”</p>
