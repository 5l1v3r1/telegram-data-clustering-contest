      <h1>Samsung's Black Friday sale is here, and there are some *stellar* deals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/haley-henschel/" target="_blank">Haley Henschel</a></address>
      <p>Not to be outdone by the likes of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-black-friday-gadgets-ad-2019/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/walmart-black-friday-2019-ad-best-deals/">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/2018-target-black-friday-ad/">Target</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/best-buy-black-friday-2019-ad-scan/">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/2kj7y">Samsung</a> has just released its own lineup of holiday deals on Galaxy devices, wearables, and laptops ahead of Black Friday. (And if we're being honest, <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/when-is-black-friday/">it's about damn time</a>.)</p>
      <p>Now, we know what you're thinking: You've seen a couple of Samsung gadgets featured in other retailers' Black Friday ads. Who cares if the brand itself is offering discounts on its products if everyone else is, too?</p>
      <p>We hear you: figuring out a <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/black-friday-cyber-monday-shopping-tips/">game plan for Black Friday</a> is stressful as it is, and you probably already have too many stores on your "to-visit" list. But hey, that's why we're here.</p>
      <p>Keep reading to find out which Samsung.com deals you should actually care about (and where you can shop instead to score better bargains on certain devices):</p>
      <h3>Get a free pair of <a href="https://zdcs.link/OK248">Galaxy Buds</a> with an eligible trade-in for a <a href="https://zdcs.link/GbxDJ">Galaxy S10</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/7yWpP">Galaxy Note10</a> smartphone</h3>

      <p>We haven't seen any good pre-Black Friday deals on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/OK248">Galaxy Buds</a> so far this year — which is kind of a shame, because <a href="https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-buds-review/">we really like them</a>. However, you can get a pair of them for free by upgrading your existing smartphone to a new <a href="https://zdcs.link/7yWpP">Samsung Galaxy Note 10</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/GbxDJ">Galaxy S10</a> (starting from $309.99 or $339.99 with eligible trade-in, respectively) anytime between Nov. 21 to Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>If you don't want to trade in your existing phone, you've got a chance of scoring a good deal on a new Samsung phone starting Nov. 21 — that's when select unlocked Galaxy Note10 and Galaxy S10 devices will be on sale for up to $300 off at <a href="https://zdcs.link/AqM4w">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/4Be24">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/OK2yn">Samsung.com</a>.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/GbxXx">Galaxy Watch Active2</a> is the latest <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-hands-on/">addition</a> to Samsung's line of smartwatches, and aside from a <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07VQJ56T3">random Amazon promotion</a> earlier this month, it's never been on sale before. It comes in two different sizes — 40mm (normally $279.99+) and 44mm (normally $299.99+) — and both of them will be $50 off on Samsung.com from Nov. 22 to Dec. 2. </p>
      <p>The following wearables are also included in Samsung's Black Friday sale:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Save $80 on the silver <a href="https://zdcs.link/VOAbd">Samsung Galaxy Watch (46mm, Bluetooth)</a> from Nov. 22 to Dec. 2. (Note: <a href="https://zdcs.link/p8exl?pageview=063nPsEMSITTKxfyaqJp3qH">Amazon</a> also has this <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/nov-18-smartwatches-fitness-trackers-apple-samsung-fitbit-garmin/">watch on sale</a>, but Samsung's discount is higher.)</li>
        <li>Save $50 on the silver <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jj3XD">Samsung Galaxy Watch (46mm, 4G LTE)</a> from Nov. 22 to Dec. 2.</li>
        <li>Save $50 when you bundle a black <a href="https://zdcs.link/1P3yR">Samsung Galaxy Watch Active</a> (40mm, Bluetooth) with one of Samsung's 10,000 mAh <a href="https://zdcs.link/yo2NJ">Wireless Charger Portable Batteries</a> from Nov. 22 to Dec. 2.</li>
        <li>Save $20 on a black <a href="https://zdcs.link/GbxYx">Samsung Galaxy Fit</a> through Dec 2. (Pro tip: You can order this one <a href="https://zdcs.link/OKX5j?pageview=03G9ywwJXaOiv9QTH0tSD0n">from Amazon</a> instead if you feel like saving an extra 99 cents.)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a href="https://zdcs.link/mxmlJ">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 (128GB, WiFi)</a> — save $100</h3>

      <p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-hands-on/">Deemed</a> "the iPad Pro's only serious competitor" by former Mashable tech reporter Raymond Wong, the 10.5-inch <a href="https://zdcs.link/mxmlJ">Galaxy Tab S6</a> is a fast, powerful, and lightweight tablet that comes with its own S Pen. Amazon will give you a free <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/nov-12-ipads-samsung-tablets-amazon/">$50 gift card</a> if you buy it off its site right now, but we recommend getting it somewhere else: Samsung is offering a $100 discount on the tablet's $649.99 MSRP from Nov. 21 to Dec. 29, and the folks over at Best Buy will give you a <a href="https://zdcs.link/PR2yA">free $100 gift card</a> if you buy it from them.</p>
      <p>Other holiday tablet deals on Samsung.com include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Save $200 on the 10.5-inch <a href="https://zdcs.link/65wgY">Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 (64GB, WiFi)</a> through Nov. 29. (FWIW, <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/nov-12-ipads-samsung-tablets-amazon/">Amazon</a> has it for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/65L6Z?pageview=06zfuomvcl3EkZT2653NoYK">same price</a>.)</li>
        <li>Save up to $80 on the 10.1-inch <a href="https://zdcs.link/W1lm6">Samsung Galaxy Tab A (32GB, WiFi)</a> on Nov. 21 and 22. (Note: Amazon will give you a free $50 gift card if you <a href="https://zdcs.link/beVpA?pageview=02pFTlpcLdRcqgqi5VYVLYK">order this tablet</a> from its site, but Samsung's deal is still better.)</li>
        <li>Save $50 on a <a href="https://zdcs.link/lPLbN">Samsung Galaxy Tab A Kids Edition (32GB, WiFi)</a> from Nov. 21 to Dec. 2.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a href="https://zdcs.link/dnYZ1">Samsung Notebook 9 Pro (256GB)</a> — save $200</h3>

      <p>Wong also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-notebook-9-pro-2019/">mused</a> that Samsung's sleek and responsive <a href="https://zdcs.link/dnYZ1">Notebook 9 Pro</a> "could be the Windows 10 laptop to beat this year" when he checked it out at CES 2019 — so, you know, no big deal. It typically retails for $1,099.99, but you can save $200 by ordering it through Samsung.com anytime between now and Nov. 30. (FYI: It's the same price at <a href="https://zdcs.link/NpXx2">Best Buy</a>, but we don't know how long that deal will last.)</p>
      <p>You can also score deals on the following laptops during Samsung's Black Friday sale:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Save $250 on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/BrbJE">Samsung Notebook 7 Spin</a> through Nov. 30.</li>
        <li>Save $200 on the 15-inch <a href="https://zdcs.link/k2PVr">Samsung Notebook 9 Pen</a> through Nov. 24. (Note: This puppy is $170 cheaper <a href="https://zdcs.link/gMNLq">on Amazon</a> with the site's digital coupon.)</li>
        <li>Save $150 on the 12.2-inch <a href="https://zdcs.link/yo2nJ">Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 (Intel Celeron, 32GB eMMC)</a> from Nov. 22 to Dec. 8. </li>
        <li>Save up to $70 on a 13.3-inch <a href="https://zdcs.link/xN0Rp">Samsung Notebook Flash (Intel Pentium Processor)</a> from Nov. 22 to Dec. 8.</li>
        <li>Save $50 on the 11.6-inch <a href="https://zdcs.link/Gbxvx">Samsung Chromebook 3 (16GB Storage, 2GB RAM)</a> from Nov. 22 to Dec. 8. (That's $6.60 cheaper than Amazon's sale price for the exact same model.)</li>
      </ul>
