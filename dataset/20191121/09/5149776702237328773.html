        <figcaption>Forest's thoughts will be turning to January window</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We are now just weeks away from the January transfer window opening for business.</p>
      <p>Nottingham Forest will join the rest of the Championship clubs looking to splash the cash on improving their squads.</p>
      <p>Fierce battles have emerged across the division already this season and signing players in January could be decisive in clubs achieving their goals towards the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>As such, plenty of rumours are already floating around as the clubs plot their activity for the January window and we have gathered some of the latest snippets below from Nottingham and their rivals.</p>
      <p>Lawrence Shankland continues to be linked with a potential January move to Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international striker is reportedly interesting several clubs ahead of the transfer window reopening in the new year, including Celtic and Rangers.</p>
      <p>A remarkable 17 goals in 13 Scottish Championship appearances for Dundee United so far this season has caught the eye - and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> could yet consider a January bid for the 24-year-old, following reported summer interest from the City Ground.</p>
      <p>So what is the latest on any Reds interest in Shankland? We take a look...</p>
      <h4>Who is leading the chase?</h4>

      <p>The Reds were extensively linked with the striker in the summer, before he joined Dundee United.</p>
      <p>At the time, Shankland claimed that staying in Scotland was the "best club for the next step of his career".</p>
      <p>However, only months later, there is a queue of suitors for the 24-year-old, who was called up to the most recent Scotland squad.</p>
      <p>The Sun reports that <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a> is looking to add another striker in January to provide competition for top scorer Lewis Grabban, who has seven goals to his name so far this season.</p>
      <p>Forest will need to overcome interest from Old Firm rivals Celtic and Rangers if they are to land their man though.</p>
      <p>The Daily Record has reported that both have been scouting the former Ayr United forward.</p>

      <p>According to reports, Sean Dyche was keen to add Phillips to his squad last summer, along with a number of admirers.</p>
      <p>The Sun reported recently that the Tykes were ready to use Matej Vydra as a makeweight in a deal, a proposal that Leeds have rebuffed.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Hernandez commits future to Leeds</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pablo Hernandez has committed his long-term future to Leeds United by signing a new contract at Elland Road.</p>

        <b>Struber named new Barnsley boss</b>
      </p>
      <p>Barnsley’s hunt for a successor to axed boss Daniel Stendel has reached its conclusion with Wolfsberger AC manager Gerhard Struber named as the club’s new boss.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old, who was officially confirmed as the Tykes’ new boss on Wednesday, guided the Austrian club to a third-place finish in his home country's top tier last season, qualifying for the Europa League in the process.</p>
      <p>Struber replaces Daniel Stendel who was sacked last month, with the Yorkshire-based outfit without a win since the opening weekend of the season.</p>
