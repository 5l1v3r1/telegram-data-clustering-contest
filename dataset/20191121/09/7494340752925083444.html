      <h1>This 'Robot Lawyer' Can Take the Mystery Out of License Agreements</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">msmash</a></address>
      <p>DoNotPay, the "robot lawyer" service that helps you contest parking tickets and even sue people, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973830/robot-lawyer-donotpay-ai-startup-license-agreements-sign-arbitration-clauses">launching a new tool to help customers understand license agreements</a>. From a report:<i> Called "<a href="https://donotpay.com/web">Do Not Sign</a>," the service is included with DoNotPay's monthly $3 subscription fee, and it lets users upload, scan, or copy and paste the URLs of any license agreements they'd like to check. The service uses machine learning to highlight clauses it thinks users need to know about, including options to opt out from data collection. It's available starting today, November 20th, on the web and via DoNotPay's app on iOS. Agreeing to lengthy license agreements is an almost weekly occurrence for many people, with modern smart devices forcing you to hit "agree" on every new contract. Do Not Sign isn't a replacement for a real lawyer, but it's better than accepting a license agreement sight unseen so you can start using a shiny new gadget, service, or app without delay.</i></p>
