      <p>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Thursday said the launch of its earth imaging and mapping satellite Cartosat-3 along with 13 commercial nano satellites from the U.S., has been rescheduled to November 27.</p>
      <p>The space agency had earlier announced that the launch is tentatively scheduled at 9:28 a.m. IST on November 25, subject to weather conditions.</p>
      <p>“The launch of PSLV-C47 carrying Cartosat-3 scheduled on November 25, 2019 at 09:28 hrs is rescheduled to launch on November 27, 2019 at 09:28 hrs from second launch pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota,” ISRO has said in an update.</p>
      <p>The satellites would be launched by India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, PSLV-C47 into Sun Synchronous Orbit from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
      <p>The Cartosat-3 is a “third generation agile advanced satellite” having high resolution imaging capability, it said, adding the satellite would be placed in an orbit of 509 km at an inclination of 97.5 degree.</p>
      <p>With an overall mass of 1,625 kg and mission life of five years, Cartosat-3 shall address the increased user’s demands for large scale urban planning, rural resource and infrastructure development, coastal land use and land cover etc.</p>
      <p>PSLV-C47 is the 21st flight of PSLV in ‘XL’ configuration (with six solid strap-on motors).</p>
      <p>PSLV-C47 would also carry 13 commercial nano satellites from the U.S. as part of a commercial arrangement with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), Department of Space.</p>
      <p>Among the 13 commercial nano satellites are FLOCK-4P, 12 in numbers, with mission objective of earth observation, and one satellite named MESHBED, whose mission objective is communication test bed.</p>
      <p>ISRO has said this would be the 74th launch vehicle mission from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota.</p>
