      <p>"She was riding in a car along a road inside the airport," AFP news agency quoted Mohamed Omar, a Somali security official, as saying. "A stray bullet hit her, and she died within a few minutes."</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear who was responsible for Ali's killing.</p>
      <p>Brigadier General Zakia Hussein, the deputy commissioner of the Somali Police Force, said investigations into the incident were continuing, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/world/africa/almaas-elman-somalia.html">reported</a>. <br/><br/>"There was not any gunfire in the airport, or in nearby areas before the incident occurred," Omar said.</p>
