      <h1>Agent claims Liverpool want £18m Cakir; Summer 2020 move ‘could be on the cards’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:05:22+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool are keen on Trabzonspor stopper Ugurcan Cakir – according to his agent Engin Kirkpinar.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old plays in the Turkish league and has a valuation of £18m, so he says.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Liverpool are one of four English sides keeping close tabs on Ugurcan,” Kirkpinar told <a href="https://turkish-football.com/liverpool-join-race-for-e20m-trabzonspor-ace-ugurcan-cakir/">Turkish-football.com</a> .</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Liverpool are among the sides interested in Cakir, and they have been monitoring his progress.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Trabzonspor value Cakir as being worth a minimum £18m, and will not sell him in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“An end-of-season move could however be on the cards.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>We find this rumour a little difficult to believe, in all honesty.</p>
      <p>Firstly, we have Alisson between the sticks, and with the Brazilian only 27-years-old, he’s guaranteed to be guarding our net for the next five years at least barring a bad injury or a freak loss of form.</p>
      <p>Then there is Adrian, the current backup who proved more than capable when called upon at the beginning of this season – winning all the Premier League games he was selected in.</p>
      <p>After those two, Caimohin Kelleher is coming through the ranks, with Kamil Grabara on loan at Huddersfield.</p>
      <p>We’d suggest that as a result, we don’t need to be spending what’s still very big money on a keeper who may not even make the bench!</p>
      <p>That money will be better spent securing backup wing-forwards and backup fullbacks – two areas we believe the squad is currently lacking.</p>
