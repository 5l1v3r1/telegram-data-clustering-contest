        <b>Do you have that acquaintance who's always asking if you can spare a little cash? This might be a good name for him or her.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Do you know someone who is frequently “borrowing” small sums of money, or small items, <a href="https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/schnorren">without ever returning the favour</a>?</p>
      <p>Then you may have yourself a <i>Schnorrer</i>. One would translate this unflattering colloquial term as “a sponger” or “a scrounger” in English.</p>
      <p>Although it’s probably inadvisable to directly call someone a <i>Schnorrer</i>, the verb form - <i>schnorren</i> - is often used light heartedly, for example when asking someone politely for something small.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where does it come from?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The word <i>Schnorrer</i> is one of the many German words with Yiddish heritage. Yiddish, the historical language of the Ashkenazi Jews, emerged in southwestern Germany between the<a href="https://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=47261"> 9th and 12th centuries</a> when Hebrew words became mixed with German.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The word Schnorrer itself seems to have come into existence in the <a href="https://www.dwds.de/wb/Schnorrer">early 18th century</a>, as a word used to refer to beggar-musicians would often travel around with a whistle, or <i>Schnurrpfeife,</i> to aid them in their quest for obtaining money.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Examples of use</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Pass auf - Er ist ein Schnorrer.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Be careful - he is a sponger.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Kann ich mir eine Zigarette von dir schnorren?</i>
      </p>
      <p>Can I pinch a cigarette from you?</p>
      <p>
        <i>Er hat Geld von allen seinen Freunden geschnorrt.</i>
      </p>
      <p>He has scrounged money from all of his friends.</p>
