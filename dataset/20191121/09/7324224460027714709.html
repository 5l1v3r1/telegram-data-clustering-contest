      <h1>Steve Clarke: The best is still to come from John McGinn</h1>
      <h2>Steve Clarke reckons the best is yet to come from Villa midfielder John McGinn after watching him extend his incredible international scoring streak for Scotland.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:01:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/david-banner/" target="_blank">David Banner</a></address>
      <p>McGinn struck twice either side of a Steven Naismith header to ensure Scotland brought the curtain down on their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a 3-1 win over Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old now has seven goals in his last six appearances for the Scots – but boss Clarke believes he can yet mature into an even better player.</p>
      <p>Ex-Albion boss Clarke said: “John is on a fantastic run of form. He has been great for Aston Villa for the last couple of seasons and he is starting to bring it onto the international stage.</p>
      <p>“It’s very important to remember he is still in the early stages of his international career.</p>
      <p>“The more games you play at this level, the better you become, the more experience you get and the better the team will become.</p>
      <p>“When you’ve got any player in goalscoring form that’s good for any team.</p>
      <p>“John is the man scoring the goals now and hopefully we’ll get one or two more that can to that as well.</p>
      <p>“We’ve found a good position for John.</p>
      <p>“He’s playing it very well, him and Steven Naismith are developing a decent understanding and as well as the goals they give us a good early press and the desire to meet the opposition high up the pitch which helps us as well.”</p>
