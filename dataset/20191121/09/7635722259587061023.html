      <h1>Boxing referees and judges from Rio Olympics banned from Tokyo games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:13:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/phil-egan" target="_blank">Phil Egan</a></address>

        <b>The International Olympic Committee task force has confirmed that none of the 36 referees and judges used at the 2016 Rio Olympics will be allowed to officiate at Tokyo 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>36 boxing officials were suspended following the event while an investigation was carried out into a number of questionable decisions.</p>
      <p>Michael Conlan was on the wrong end of a controversial points defeat to Vladimir Nikitin in Rio and it was the last time the Belfast boxer fought as an amateur.</p>
      <p>Scores from judges will now be displayed publicly at the end of each round during qualifying and at the Olympics.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.olympic.org/news/transparency-highlighted-in-tokyo-2020-olympic-boxing-regulations">Boxing task force chair Morinari Watanabe said</a>: "The main objective of the IOC boxing task force is to ensure the completion of the mission of delivering events, while putting the boxers first, and with transparent and credible sporting results and fair play."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Michael Conlan will get the opportunity to avenge that defeat to Nikitin when the two square off in the pro ranks on December 14th in New York.</p>
      <p>Conlan is moving one step closer to a world title fight with the news that he has moved up from third to the number one contender for Shakur Stevenson's WBO featherweight title.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Gary "Spike" O'Sullivan has landed himself a world title fight in the new year.</p>
      <p>The Cork middleweight will face unbeaten Mexican Jaime Munguia at the Alamodome in San Antonio on January 11th.</p>
      <p>Munguia is moving up in weight having maintained an unbeaten record at light-middleweight, which included a tight points win over Ireland's Dennis Hogan.</p>
      <p>Spike said: "For me, it’s a dream come true to fight the undefeated champion of the world and the number-one ranked fighter in the world.</p>
      <p>"It makes it even better that he’s Mexican. I grew up watching the great Mexican champions and to get the opportunity to fight Jaime is an honour.</p>
      <p>"I will leave no stone unturned in my preparation for this fight. I can’t recall feeling more motivated by any other fight in my career thus far. I believe this fight will be a war that the fans will talk about for many years to come."</p>
