      <h1>Esperance Shalom House supporters begin working towards $150K fundraising goal</h1>

      <p>The founder of Shalom House visited Esperance on November 20, to discuss the future of the town's proposed rehabilitation centre.</p>
      <p>Shire staff met with Peter Lyndon-James at the potential building site to discuss the project's next move.</p>
      <p>Community members who had volunteered their time, skills and resources to bring the program to life were also present.</p>
      <p>Despite a property being offered to the group rent free for a year, plans were put on hold in September, after it was revealed about $200,000 was needed for mandatory reclassification and modification.</p>
      <p>In order for the property to be used as a rehabilitation facility, it was required to be brought from a class 1 residential property to a class 3.</p>
      <p>Mr Lyndon-James said he'd like to see the house open by May, but it depended on the community raising the initial funds to begin works.</p>
      <p>However, he said the November meeting was a positive step forward, with draftspeople helping to determine the scope of works.</p>
      <p>"We have essential support from the Esperance Shire staff both on the planning side and on behalf of the chief executive officer and councillors, who have all been exceptional," Mr Lyndon-James said.</p>
      <p>"They've given us some guidance about what needs to happen before we take possession of the property.</p>
      <p>"There's no place as good as Esperance, it is a really beautiful town.</p>
      <p>"I am blown away by the amount of people that want to help.</p>
      <p>"It's up to the community of Esperance to raise the money and it is my job to send down all the trained staff, plus ten residents to get it started.</p>
      <p>"What I say to every community, is before we are able to run a 100 per cent self-funded rehab, we need a house rent free for a year and $150,000 to start it off."</p>
      <p>Mr Lyndon-James said some local farmers had already pledged a percentage of their crop sales to help get the project off the ground.</p>
      <p>Esperance local Jo-Anne McLaren said she would rally to support and fundraise by selling mangoes.</p>
      <p>"I'm a recovered addict and my heart is for people to find freedom from addiction," she said.</p>
      <p>"It is incredible the amount of people who know somebody who has done Shalom, who is in Shalom or who needs Shalom.</p>
      <p>"I'm so happy to be on the front line and to be able to share my passion."</p>
      <p>Mr Lyndon-James welcomed any community fundraising initiatives or tradespeople to offer their skills.</p>
