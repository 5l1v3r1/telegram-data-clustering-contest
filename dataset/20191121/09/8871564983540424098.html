      <p>A 12-year-old boy has become the youngest person to be convicted over Hong Kong’s ongoing anti-government protest movement after he pleaded guilty to vandalizing a police station and train station in October.</p>
      <p>The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested on Oct. 3, a day after he was caught spraying graffiti outside Mong Kok police station and on one of the exits at Prince Edward MTR station as <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/flash-mob-protests-kick-off-in-hong-kong-as-anger-surges-over-teen-shot-by-police/">protests took off across the city</a>.</p>
      <p>Stand News reports that he <a href="https://thestandnews.com/politics/10-3-%E5%A4%AA%E5%AD%90-%E5%99%B4-%E6%AD%BB%E9%BB%91%E8%AD%A6%E5%85%A8%E5%AE%B6%E6%AF%94%E7%8B%97x-%E7%AD%89%E5%AD%97%E5%8F%A5-12-%E6%AD%B2%E7%94%B7%E7%AB%A5%E8%AA%8D%E5%85%A9%E9%A0%85%E5%88%91%E6%AF%80-%E4%BA%94%E5%80%8B%E6%9C%88%E4%BE%86%E7%A4%BA%E5%A8%81%E6%A1%88%E4%B8%AD%E6%9C%80%E5%B9%B4%E8%BC%95%E8%A2%AB%E5%91%8A/">pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal damage</a> at West Kowloon Magistrates’ Court.</p>
      <p>The words he graffitied were “Damn Corrupt Cops,” along with an apparent obscenity about police families, on the police station, and “Divine Annihilation, Free HK” outside the MTR station.</p>
      <p>The outlet reported that he was followed home by a police officer, and that the following day as he went downstairs to go to school, he was arrested by police officers waiting outside. A search of his home turned up black paints and clothing.</p>
      <p>The defendant’s father, grandparents, and high school principal were in court today.</p>
      <p>In a mitigating statement, the boy’s attorney asked for leniency, saying that her client was only in his second year of high school, and that his parents divorced when he was young.</p>
      <p>She added that although his academic performance wasn’t great, his teachers had nothing but positive comments about him, describing him as a helpful and serious student.</p>
      <p>As for why he committed the crime, she said, the boy was troubled by the situation in Hong Kong, had acted out of impulse, and was remorseful for what he did.</p>
      <p>Sentencing has been adjourned for Dec. 19, pending a report from a probation officer.</p>
