      <p>SANDAKAN (Nov 21): Malaysian bubble tea brand Tealive expects to open its first store in the Philippines next month.</p>
      <p>Parent company Loob Holdings Sdn Bhd’s founder and chief executive officer Bryan Loo said the Philippines would be Tealive’s eighth market after Malaysia, United Kingdom, Australia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Brunei and China.</p>
      <p>“Collectively, we have over 20 outlets at the moment, and the Philippines will be the latest addition this year,” he told reporters during the soft launch of its outlet at Mydin Sandakan here today.</p>
      <p>Loo said Tealive currently has 408 outlets nationwide and also has a long-term plan to set up over 100 outlets in China next year.</p>
      <p>He said Tealive is constantly upgrading its customer service to enhance customer experience at its outlets.</p>
      <p>“We are also the first in the market to use a tea dispenser, so it makes the whole experience a bit more modernised.</p>
      <p>“Last time, baristas would have their backs to the customers, but right now, with the tea dispenser, baristas can face customers, which encourages barista-customer interaction,” he said.</p>
      <p>On the latest outlet in Sandakan operated by TLV Sandokan Sdn Bhd, its chairman Datuk Affendi Hamdan said Tealive allowed franchisees to set up a business under the brand with low investment.</p>
      <p>He said Tealive’s attractive business venture offers has encouraged TLV Sandokan to set up another outlet at Sandakan Harbour Mall and in Lahad Datu.</p>
      <p>“Every month Tealive introduces new products accompanied by special promotions, which attract customers.</p>
      <p>“Other than that, the franchise concept allows more jobs to be created for the locals, who will get the chance to go to Kuala Lumpur for a comprehensive two weeks’ training,” he said.</p>
      <p>Tealive also has another outlet in Sandakan with another partner as well as outlets in Kota Kinabalu, Tawau and Semporna.</p>
