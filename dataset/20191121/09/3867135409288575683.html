      <p>I would like to thank Mr. Clay of Snohomish for his <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/opinion/speak-up-at-lake-stevens-city-council-meeting-about-costco/">letter to the editor</a>, sharing his concerns and sharing the time and date of the public hearing in Lake Stevens for the proposed Costco.</p>
      <p>As a Lake Stevens resident, I am very interested in attending this meeting as well. I am tired of the current options of either driving 14 miles or 15 miles to get to Costco. I am tired of only having three grocery stores in town that are all too overpriced to be realistic options for the needs of my family of eight, although we do love Haggen donuts!</p>
      <p>I understand there are concerns about traffic impacts to the surrounding area of the proposed Costco. All I can say is, for me and the other 30,000 residents of Lake Stevens, <i>not</i> having to drive on the trestle or on extended lengths of Highway 9 and/or I-5 to get to Costco will definitely have a traffic impact of its own.</p>
      <p>I am also tired of paying all my sales tax on my Costco purchases to support the communities of Marysville and Everett. If Lake Stevens is going to continue to thrive in this age of growth, and we are growing, whether people choose to accept that fact or not, we are going to need access to our own sales tax revenues to support our own community. Costco, we need you! (WinCo, would you pretty please come, too? Then all my dreams would come true.)</p>
