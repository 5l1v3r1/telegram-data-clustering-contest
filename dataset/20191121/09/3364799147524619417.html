      <p>A digital banking startup backed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Orlando Bloom is battling to raise cash, and WeWork's public meltdown could be to blame, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/dicaprio-backed-digital-bank-aspiration-has-run-into-funding-issue.html">according to CNBC</a>.</p>
      <p>Aspiration — which also counts eBay's founder Pierre Omidyar and its former president Jeff Skoll among its investors — <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/aspiration-is-launching-spend-and-save-account-2019-2?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">previously raised $110 million</a>. However, it has struggled to coax investors into participating in its latest financing round, CNBC reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
      <p>The online-only bank, which allows customers to pay what they want and doesn't work with fossil-fuel or firearms companies, wanted to raise at least $200 million at a valuation north of $1 billion, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aspiration-fundraising/digital-banking-startup-aspiration-seeks-new-funding-round-idUSKCN1RT1SY">Reuters reported in April</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weworks-nightmare-ipo?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">collapse of WeWork's IPO</a> — which resulted in the coworking startup's valuation plunging, cofounder Adam Neumann stepping down as CEO, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/softbank-agrees-to-rescue-wework-in-a-bailout-deal-2019-10?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">SoftBank bailing it out</a> — could be responsible for Aspiration's challenges. "This is a company that would've gotten funded a year ago," a fintech CEO told CNBC.</p>
      <p>Venture capitalists are "becoming more discerning about the outcomes on latter-stage rounds," the executive added. "If you're going to fund something at a $1 billion valuation, are you sure you can get a $3 billion valuation in an IPO?"</p>
      <p>Los Angeles-based Aspiration could be in trouble. It slashed its headcount by 15% last month and has delayed paying vendors for several months, CNBC reported. The backlash from suppliers led to the bulk of the firm's acquisition team quitting, former employees told CNBC, adding that managers said during a company meeting that it was "normal" to withhold payment from some vendors.</p>
      <p>However, Aspiration has dismissed claims that it's running short of cash.</p>
      <p>Cofounder and CEO Andrei Cherney said in an email to CNBC that more than 1.5 million Americans have signed up for Aspiration, it has raised more than $50 million this year with further commitments to come, and "prudent cash management and changing up your team structure is part of being a startup."</p>
