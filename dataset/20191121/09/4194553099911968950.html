        <i>This is the kind of over the top rhetoric that will be completely turned around when we lose a game – so it’s important to take this and eventually what will come with a massive pinch of salt!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Former Premier League boss turned pundit/celebrity Harry Redknapp has fully backed Jurgen Klopp’s Reds to secure the title.</p>
      <p>In fact, so confident is he in Liverpool, that he’s suggested we’ll go unbeaten, matching Arsenal’s famous 2003/04 campaign and in the process – force Manchester City to give up and focus on the Champions League instead…</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Oh yeah for sure, I can’t see any other outcome than Liverpool winning it,” he said, cited in the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7706389/Harry-Redknapp-backs-Liverpool-beat-Man-City-title.html">Mail</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I mean, absolutely for me, it’s an impossibility. I can’t even see Liverpool losing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I think Man City will chase them for a while, then I think they will realise that Liverpool aren’t slipping up and then I think they will put all their eggs in the Champions League basket. Man City should try to win that this year.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s crazy that such statements are being made when there are still 26 games of the Premier League season to go…</p>
      <p>Mathematically we can still get relegated and all it would take is a poor few weeks and our eight point lead will be lost.</p>
      <p>No Reds think anything is already won yet and know full well that it’s going to take a monumental, considered effort every week to maintain the gap between ourselves, City and everyone else.</p>
