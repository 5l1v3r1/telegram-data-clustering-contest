      <p>Accra, Nov. 20, GNA - Retired Ghanaian footballers living in the United Kingdom (UK) last Sunday played a special match to honour veteran coach Joseph E. Sarpong.</p>
      <p>The former Hearts and Kotoko trainer who was present in at the match venue in London was delighted with the acknowledgment by the retired footballers.</p>
      <p>Prior to the match up, coach Sarpong exchanged pleasantries with former Ashanti Gold trio - Tony Arhinful, Prince Owusu-Ansah and goalkeeper Richard Obimpeh.</p>
      <p>Ghanaian-born former Togo international, Eric Akoto, Moro Issah, Daniel Edusei, Ernest Adu, KwamePoku and Mark Fish were in attendance at the Birchmere Park in Thamesmead, London.</p>
      <p>After a scrappy first 20 minutes, the home side took the lead moments after goalkeeper Ebenezer Amoako Skelenzy had produced a double save to keep the opponentâ€™s forward out.</p>
      <p>Diminutive striker, Kevin Ohemeng Frimpong equalised 12 minutes later with a superb finish after goalkeeper Richard Obimpeh failed to deal with a cross from Ernest Adu.</p>
      <p>Issah and Adu combined effectively as they dictated the pace in midfield.</p>
      <p>Things continue to liven up in the second half after a penalty appeal on Kevin was ignored by the referee.</p>
      <p>On the 70th minute, Eric Akoto shot wide with only Obimpeh at his mercy.</p>
      <p>Theophilus 'Abega' Kissi made it 2-1 for the visitors and as they looked on course for a memorable win, the hosts pushed hard and found the equaliser.</p>
