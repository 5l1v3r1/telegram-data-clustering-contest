      <p>The Penticton Vees stumbled on the road Thursday night, falling 7-2 to the Coquitlam Express at the Poirier Sports &amp; Leisure Centre.</p>
      <p>The loss ended a three-game win streak for the Vees (21-6-1-0), which return to home ice Friday night for a matchup against the Chilliwack Chiefs (12-8-4-1).</p>
      <p>The Vees started the game strong, forcing Coquitlam onto the defence for most of the opening 10 minutes. But it was the Express that opened the scoring, and never looked back.</p>
      <p>Coquitlam would score three before Penticton got on the board 15 minutes into the second period. The Vees wouldnâ€™t score again until the 14:52 mark of the third, by which point it was 6-2.</p>
      <p>Vees goalie Yaniv Perets stopped 12 of the 17 shots he faced in the game in his 4th loss of the season before being relieved by Carl Stankowski, who turned aside 12 of the 14 shots thrown his way. Clay Stevenson made 25 of the 27 shots he faced in his 17th victory of the season for the Express.</p>
      <p>Vees goals came from David Silye and Tyler Ho.</p>
      <p>Penticton remains atop the Interior Division and only trails Coquitlam by one point in the BCHL standings.</p>
