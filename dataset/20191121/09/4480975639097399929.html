      </ul>
      <p>The USD/CAD pair held steady near multi-week tops, just above the 1.3300 handle, with bulls still awaiting a sustained breakthrough a 5-1/2 month-old descending trend-line <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>.<br/> <br/>Given that the overnight move beyond the very important 200-day SMA, a sustained breakthrough the mentioned trend-line barrier might now be seen as a key trigger for bullish traders.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> maintained their bullish bias and have also eased from slightly overbought conditions on hourly charts, reinforcing the constructive outlook.<br/> <br/>However, traders are likely to wait for a strong follow-through buying beyond the said barrier before positioning for a subsequent appreciating move towards October monthly swing highs near mid-1.3300s.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, any meaningful pullback might attract some dip-buying near the 1.3275 region (200-DMA), which if broken might negate the positive bias and prompt some aggressive long-unwinding trade.<br/> <br/>Below the said support, the pair is likely to accelerate the corrective slide further towards challenging the 1.3200 handle before eventually dropping to the next major support near the 1.3160-50 region.</p>
