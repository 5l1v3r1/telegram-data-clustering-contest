      <p>South African singer, <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">AKA</a> has celebrated the cancellation of African Unite Concert, where Burna Boy is expected to perform.</p>
      <p>The concert was scheduled to hold on 22nd and 23rd, November in a response to recent xenophobia in the country.</p>
      <p>A South Africa’s media house, Timeslive, however, reported that the organisers of the concert took such decision as a result of the outrages it has caused on social media.</p>
      <p>A statement released by the organisers reads “The decision to cancel the Africans Unite Concert comes after the call from the Tshwane Entertainment Collective to boycott the Africans Unite concert in Tshwane.</p>
      <p>“With the increasing threats of violence from other unfortunate segments of the public and without any government intervention, Phambili Media and Play Network Africa were prompted to take the threats and warnings seriously, as the safety of all artists and attendees could not be guaranteed.</p>
      <p>“We then decided to cancel the concert. The safety of all attendees, artists, and crew comes first,” the statement reads.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the development, AKA took to his Twitter handle to say “hay no, South Ahhh doesn’t play.”</p>
      <p>Recall that<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/10/24/what-aka-said-as-burna-boy-is-set-to-perform-in-south-africa/"> the singer and AKA clashed on Twitter</a> over xenophobic attacks and the afrobeat star on September 3 vowed not to visit South Africa.</p>
      <p>AKA thereafter asked <a href="http://concisenews.global/2019/11/14/burna-boy-asked-to-apologise-ahead-of-performance-in-south-africa/">Burna Boy to prove he is truly African Giant</a> by apologising to citizens of South Africa, but the Nigerian star refused.</p>
