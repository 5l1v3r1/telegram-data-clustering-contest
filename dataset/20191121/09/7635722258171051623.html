        <b>Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has accused Fine Gael of 'speaking from both sides of their mouth' on immigration.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He was responding to questions on whether it would be a major issue in next year's general election.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Newstalk Breakfast</i>, he cautioned against politicians using migration as an electoral issue.</p>
      <p>He observed: "I've always felt there was a very strong consensus among political leaders across the political divide that we would never use migration as a vehicle for electoral or political leverage - we need to double down and recommit to that."</p>
      <p>Deputy Martin said he was 'surprised' by some <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/varadkar-tolerate-illegal-immigration-920922">recent comments</a></b> from Leo Varadkar.</p>
      <p>The Fianna Fáil leader explained: "The Taoiseach came out, for example, and just named Albanians and Georgians as problematic. Now why did he to do that in the middle of a debate around direct provision in Achill? I thought that was a mistake</p>
      <blockquote>"I think Fine Gael are speaking out of both sides of their mouth on this, because they're nervous of it and they're not taking a clear line in it."</blockquote>
      <p>He added: "To be fair, I'm not saying they're in the same league as Deputy Noel Grealish was last week when he clearly premeditatedly went into the Dáil at a leader's questions, and I think made some very loaded points in terms of transfers of wealth back to other countries.</p>
      <p>"He instanced Nigeria in particular, which turned out not to be factually correct."</p>
      <h3>'Extraordinary comments'</h3>
      <p>Deputy Martin also addressed <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/situation-around-fg-candidates-asylum-remarks-outrageous-immigrant-council-926592">the controversy</a></b> around Fine Gael by-election candidate Verona Murphy's comments on asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>He suggested they were "extraordinary comments" - but noted it was important to note they have been retracted.</p>
      <p>Deputy Martin added: "To conflate ISIS with migration was a shocking thing to do, because they're not related.</p>
      <blockquote>"I do think the fact that the comments were withdrawn and denounced is important actually, and that people moved to clearly reveal the nonsense and the dangerous nature of those comments... in the middle of an election campaign."</blockquote>
      <p>There has been controversy over a visit by Ms Murphy to visit a centre in Waterford to "gain a better understanding of asylum and refugee issues".</p>
      <p>Deputy Martin suggested that the people in the centre were 'used' by Fine Gael, although added he "didn't know the full details" around the visit - including any role played by Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan.</p>
      <p>He argued: "I think we do need more clarity around that - [including] the role of the Minister for Justice, who is the director of elections as well, and whether he used his influence."</p>
      <p>One of Fianna Fáil's own by-election candidates - Senator Lorainne Clifford-Lee - has been under fire following the emergence of <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/offensive-tweets-lorraine-clifford-lee-not-see-end-career-party-says-924221">controversial old tweets</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Deputy Martin said the tweets were 'wrong', but suggested the senator 'hasn't deviated from party policy' on inclusion and equality issues since entering the Seanad.</p>
