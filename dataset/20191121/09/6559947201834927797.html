      <p>Amazon has updated its collection of Echo smart speakers quite recently, so Black Friday will definitely be filled with discounts on the new or old versions of these handy devices.</p>
      <p>Amazon Echo devices, alongside the TV fire sticks, were some of the best selling devices in <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alexa-how-was-prime-day-prime-day-2019-surpassed-black-friday">2018 and during Prime Day 2019</a>, so we are in no doubt that Amazon will be pushing the speakers even further in the coming sales.</p>

However, the giant retailer did reveal that <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181127005388/en/Amazon-Announces-Record-Breaking-Holiday-Shopping-Weekend-Cyber">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a> surpassed its expectations last year, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-27/amazon-mass-merchants-win-on-black-friday-malls-and-guns-lose">Bloomberg reported</a> that Americans spent a record <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-27/amazon-mass-merchants-win-on-black-friday-malls-and-guns-lose">$7.9 billion online on Cyber Monday in 2018</a> (£6.4 billion). Judging by its Prime Day and Black Friday success year after year, we expect Amazon will continue to push its own products as much as possible. <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/amazon-prime/prime-day-2018-by-the-numbers">Best-sellers worldwide</a> continue to be the Fire TV Stick and Echo Dot, with Fire tablets making massive gains in <a href="http://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alexa-how-was-prime-day-prime-day-2019-surpassed-black-friday">2019</a>. New Kindle kids editions, alongside and new lineup of Echo devices will be big highlights for the retailer. Although Prime membership isn't a requirement this time around, Amazon revels in locking great deals behind its paywall with exclusive lightning deals that can run out quickly, hence the name. You can sign up to a <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/7vu7?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F118221%2F1%2F%3Finline">free 30-day trial membership</a> or pay for <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/7vu7?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F118221%2F1%2F%3Finline">one month of Prime</a> for only £7.99 if you don't want to commit to a <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/7vu7?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F118221%2F1%2F%3Finline">one year membership</a>, which costs £79.
