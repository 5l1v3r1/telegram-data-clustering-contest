      <p>A Delhi court has allowed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to interrogate former Union minister P Chidambaram in Tihar jail on November 22-23 in connection with the INX Media case.</p>
      <p>The ED on Thursday moved the Rose Avenue Court seeking to interrogate P Chidambaram in Tihar jail in the INX Media case.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Chidambaram had moved the Supreme Court seeking bail in the INX Media corruption case and the ED had approached the Delhi High Court, seeking rectification of an error in the November 15 verdict denying him relief.</p>
      <p>Chidambaram approached the apex court challenging the judgement of the Delhi High Court denying him bail in the money laundering case lodged by the ED.</p>
      <p>Later, ED moved the high court with an application urging the court to correct the "accidental slip /inadvertent error" in its November 15 verdict passed by Justice Suresh Kait who had denied bail to the 74-year old former finance minister.</p>
      <p>As per ED's application, Justice Kait had referred to four paragraphs from a 2017 Supreme Court order rejecting bail to Delhi-based lawyer Rohit Tandon in a money laundering case in his November 15 verdict.</p>
      <p>Tandon, who was arrested in 2016, is an accused in the demonetisation-related money laundering case.</p>
