      <p>We're leaning ever closer to official confirmation of a standalone screamer from <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/m/">BMW's M</a> division. <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/bmw/108476/bmw-m-boss-confirms-standalone-m-model"><i>Auto Express</i> spoke to brand boss Markus Flasch</a> during the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/la-auto-show/">L.A. Auto Show</a>, the German saying, "I can think of doing standalone M-cars – I like the idea, and I think we’re going to do something in this direction." Under further questioning, specifically about whether M might have an SUV in mind for the putative offering, Flasch replied, "I don’t know. … Well I do know, but I’m not saying yet!" Other sources inside the Munich automaker apparently told <i>Auto <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/express/">Express</a></i> "a new car could be seen by 2021" and bring some sort of electrification with it.</p>
      <p>This represents noteworthy movement from <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/06/18/bmw-m-division-studying-standalone-model/">BMW's position in June</a>, when Flasch told Australian outlet <i>Car Sales</i>,  "We are investigating M variants that may also be standalone, that don't have a predecessor." At the time, a company insider said everything was in "a very early stage" of examining body styles, and Flasch said qualified the push by saying a potential model <i>may</i> be a product of M division, as opposed to based on a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/">BMW</a> offering.</p>
      <p>The 2021 dates carries significance because 2022 marks the M division's 50th anniversary as an independent company. If M plans to debut something roadworthy and with production intent before the end of 2021, prototypes are no more than a year away. That means BMW has decided on the fundamentals and will be sorting out how to make them work together. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/06/25/bmw-vision-m-next-concept-debuts-m-division-fkr33b/">plug-in hybrid Vision M Next</a> sounds like a long shot, though, even if BMW design chief Damagoj Dukec would like the 600-horsepower show car to get the nod, saying, "We have a heritage of bringing art cars and race cars together with M. I am convinced that this [Vision M Next] is the right way." Flasch, however, explained that the halo "doesn’t necessarily have to be a mid-engined <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/supercars/">supercar</a>," only that "it has to stand out from the crowd."</p>
      <p>Closer to production reality, Flasch also said an electrified M car is "not too far away." At the same time, he cautioned that adding electric aids is no panacea; "electrification is not rocket science, and it’s not the game changer [in] that people think it’s an easy answer to every question."</p>
