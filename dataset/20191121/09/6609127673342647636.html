        <b>FORMER Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers was Tottenham's first choice before they brought in Jose Mourinho, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ex-Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United manager is the new man in the Spurs hotseat after replacing Mauricio Pochettino.</p>

      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705673/Jose-Mourinhos-arrival-month-pipeline-Spurs-manager-shock-unfolded.html">Daily Mail</a> claim chairman Daniel Levy enquired about the now Leicester City boss Rodgers but was told prising him away from the Foxes would be impossible.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had been out of work since his sacking from Old Trafford and it is believed his eagerness for the Spurs job ensured landing him would be much easier than trying for Rodgers.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman only joined Leicester in February this year after leaving the<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/"> Hoops</a> mid-season.</p>
      <p>Rodgers had won back-to-back trebles and secured the Betfred Cup once again in his third campaign before departing for now boss Neil Lennon - who lifted the Premiership and Scottish Cup.</p>

      <p>Leicester are flying high in second spot in the English Premier League after 12 games - with just table toppers Liverpool ahead of them.</p>
      <p>The Foxes have only lost two games in the league and have the meanest defence, conceding just eight goals.</p>
      <p>They are also the second top scorers in England's top flight with only champions Manchester City ahead of them.</p>
      <p>Rodgers' side equalled the record for the biggest ever Premier League win with a 9-0 win over Southampton last month.</p>
      <p>Spurs have struggled this campaign and sit 14th in the table - a massive 11 points behind the Champions League places.</p>
      <p>Leicester currently sit nine points ahead of Sheffield United in fifth in the race for a spot in Europe's elite competition next season.</p>
      <p>Both sides return to EPL action this weekend with Rodgers and Co travelling to face Brighton and Spurs' new regime under Mourinho kicking off at West Ham.</p>
