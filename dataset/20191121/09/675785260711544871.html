      <p>A couple got married at 34,000ft in front of stunned plane passengers after bonding over their love of aircraft.</p>
      <p>David Valliant and Cathy Rolfe met through an online aviation game called Aviation City eight years ago and immediately hit it off.</p>
      <p>They had their first date at Sydney Airport and fell in love as soon as they locked eyes.</p>
      <p>After years of dating, the New Zealand couple struggled to find a venue for their wedding - before deciding to stick with the theme of their love story and exchange vows in the air.</p>

      <p>They eventually got married on board a Jetstar flight JQ201, travelling between their home cities Sydney and Auckland on October 9.</p>
      <p>Cathy walked down the aisle in a stunning white dress as David waited at the front of the plane.</p>
      <p>Airline staff rallied behind the couple to bring their special day forward after Cathy secretly contacted Jetstar with a special request to get married on a flight between their two countries.</p>
      <p>Cathy said: "I thought, I'll be cheeky and ask Jetstar. Without telling Dave, I posted on Jetstar's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page with the ask. I was so excited when they said they'd see what they could do."</p>

      <p>Staff arranged for the wedding party to sit at the front of the plane while other passengers sat further back, reports the Mail.</p>
      <p>Cathy said: "It was the most amazing experience and something we will remember for the rest of our lives.</p>
      <p>"Our love of aviation is what brought us together."</p>
      <p>In another alternative wedding, we revealed how couple Ciara O’Donnell and Bobby Cook swapped roles for their wedding.</p>
      <p>Ciara donned a tux alongside her three bridesmaids, while strapping 6ft 4in Bobby put on a £45 frock and tiara and got his two groomsmen to wear dresses, too.</p>

      <p>Bobby said: “We always joked Ciara wears the trousers in the relationship, so it made sense for her to wear them at the wedding.</p>
      <p>“Ciara said she wouldn’t be walking down the aisle for me, so I walked down the aisle for her. So we decided to do everything backwards.</p>
      <p>"I took her family name. It was so relaxed and everyone had a great laugh. There were a few gobsmacked faces.”</p>
