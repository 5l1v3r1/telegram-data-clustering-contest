      <p>A big-hearted Alexandria girl is showing the true spirit of Christmas by helping local kids living in poverty.</p>
      <p>The festive period is an expensive one for families nationwide, however kind Amy Conkie has gone above and beyond to ensure that kids in West Dunbartonshire can be rewarded for their good behaviour by unwrapping new toys on Christmas morning.</p>
      <p>Aspiring photographer and Vale of Leven Academy pupil Amy, 12, has organised two sold out photoshoots and Christmas Fayre fundraisers – with all the money raised being donated to West Dunbartonshire Community Foodshare’s toybank appeal.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Proud mum Lesley explained how Amy’s fundraising journey began.</p>
      <p>She said: “She did it last year, she watched a video on YouTube where James English went homeless for a week and that really prompted her to act.</p>
      <p>“She had fallen in love with photography so we got her her own wee camera and she decided that she’d start organising photoshoots to raise money.</p>
      <p>“Last year she organised a photoshoot for a homeless charity in Glasgow called The Invisibles, but this year we wanted to do something a bit closer to home.</p>
      <p>“When we got in touch with the Foodshare Clair (Coyle) asked if she would be okay to buy the toys. She raised £634 last year and this year she’s doing two Christmas fayres as well so we’re hoping to raise even more.”</p>

      <p>Clair added: “We spoke to Amy’s mum about what to do with the money, but we thought that because she was a kid, it might be best if she bought the toys herself because she’ll know better than us what young people are into, and she did an excellent job.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Fundraising is nothing new for Amy however, who has already raised plenty for those less fortunate than her.</p>
      <p>Lesley continued: “When she was four she saw a wee girl on Lorraine Kelly who had lost all of her hair, and I think it was because of leukaemia or another form of cancer, and straight away she said she would give her, her hair.</p>
      <p>“Straight away I was like no you’re not, but she was quite serious about it and said that it’s only her hair and that it’ll grow back, and who am I to say no to that?</p>
      <p>“So she ended up raising £1500 for a cancer charity by doing that.</p>
      <p>“I really couldn’t be any more proud of her.”</p>
