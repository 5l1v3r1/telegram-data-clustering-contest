      <h1>Shotts author launches his new Rangers book, '10 Matches, 10 Players'</h1>
      <h2>Stuart spent a short while interviewing former legends and now his book is avalibale at Rangers stores.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:55:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Thomson</a></address>
      <p>A Shotts author has put his passion into print, chronicling some of the greatest games of his football club.</p>
      <p>Stuart Thomson has spent the past few months interviewing former Rangers stars and then putting the finishing touches to his new book Rangers: 10 Matches, 10 Players.</p>
      <p>The likes of Derek Johnstone, Tom Forsyth, Andy Goram, Ian Durrant and Nacho Novo have contributed to the book with Goram, Durrant and Marvin Andrews helping to launch the book earlier this month at the Stonefield Tavern in Blantyre.</p>
      <p>The book also features a foreword written by the late Fernando Ricksen.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Stuart said: “Interviewing the players was fantastic. Some of them were my heroes growing up.</p>
      <p>“It’s such a simple concept having 10 players talk about their games and then doing some research on them.</p>
      <p>“Speaking to the publishers, this could be the first in a series for various teams across the UK so it’s nice to be involved in it.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got some really big names from Rangers history so it was a pleasure to be part of it.</p>
      <p>“Having Fernando be part of the book has now taken on special significance and I’m hoping the book does him justice.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Stuart organised a charity game involving a Rangers Legends side taking on a Shotts Select in memory of his brother Gordon, who lost a short battle with cancer in 2018.</p>
      <p>The event raised over £13,500 for Macmillan Cancer Support and Stuart admits writing the book brought back a lot of memories he shared with his family and friends down the years.</p>
      <p>He added: “I found the whole experience quite cathartic in a way.</p>
      <p>“It was nice to look back at games and think of memories and what we were doing at that time.</p>
      <p>“It has been a busy period over the past few months with organising the charity game and writing the book but it’s been enjoyable.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I’m 56 now and couldn’t remember every detail from every game so it’s been good to go back and research them.”</p>
      <p>Stuart’s book is available at the Rangers FC stores in Glasgow city centre and Belfast as well as online at www.rangers10matches.com</p>
      <p>A proportion of each sale will go towards the Rangers Ex Players Benevolent Fund.</p>
