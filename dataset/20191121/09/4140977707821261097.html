          <p>A hectic and congested opening day in the Super League comes to an end with Karnataka and Tamil Nadu squaring off against each other this Wednesday. The final of four matches to be played today, this is match which looks set to be a humdinger of a contest, a fixture which is set to engross us immerse us in a riveting brand of cricket.</p>
          <p>Ending on top of Group B of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Tamil Nadu lost just the singular fixture out of the six matches they played with the side carrying a three match winning spree into today’s imminent encounter. Their previous 113 run win against Vidharbha was a momentous one, a result which saw them completely outplay and outshine their opponents as they decimated and dismantled them to maraud their way to a compelling result.</p>

                <p>Putting on a massive 168 while batting first, the side returned with an equally immaculate bowling effort to send their opponents packing for a chastening 55. The display was one which was a testament to the exuberant skill set packed within this setup, a display which the side will be looking to emote today as well when they take on Karnataka.</p>
                <p>Karnataka themselves meanwhile are coming into the tie in sublime form with the side having galloped their way to the five wins as well in six matches, only sitting in second place behind Baroda by the barest margins of net run-rate. The side haven’t lost a single match sin being ousted in their tournamnet opener with their most recent affair seeing them put down Services by 35 runs after cantering their way to a gigantic 195.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>Despite this surface set to be one which will unravel and peter off as we run down the course of the match, the wetness on the field in the night part of the clash is going to lead the side winning the toss opting to field first. Overall, strokeplay over here will be a tepid and tentative task with the pitch turning both ways and seeing the spinners control the majority of the proceedings.</p>

                            <h3>Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With 202 runs in the tournamnet till now, our selection for the wicket-keeping slot was an evident one. We have Tamil Nadu’s Dinesh Karthik being brought in by us over here with the player begin someone who can understand the tricky and dicey conditions prevelant for the bats today.</p>
                            <h3>Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Ever since the Vijay Hazare Trophy, there has been one player who has stood tall amongst the rest of his counterparts and piled on the runs to emerge as their leading run getter in this edition of the marquee T20 tournamnet. In their opener Devdutt Padikal, Karnataka have a name who has constantly scored for the side across the course of the last two matches to see him sitting on 303 runs as things stand, making him our pick for this encounter.</p>
                            <p>Karun Nair comes in as well after having scored the 136 runs while from the other side we are closing out our slot with the selection of Shahrukh Khan, someone who has thrived and flourished in the shortest format of the game.</p>
                            <h3>All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>The 94 runs and 4 wickets for Vijay Shankar mean the all-rounder form Tamil Nadu will be coming into our setup. A player who has miserably failed at the international level has managed to subject his side to some reasonable displays in the domestic circuit and given his ability to encapsulate his skill set with both the bat and ball, we’ll be sticking with him for this one.</p>
                            <p>Pavan Deshpande meanwhile from the other side comes in a swell as we opt for the one player apiece from either side.</p>
                            <h3>Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>His team’s leading wicket taker with 13 wickets in just 6 matches, legspinner Shreyas Gopal was the first name who sprung to other side when we approached this segment of our Dream 11 unit. The wrist spinner has mauled his opponents, engulfing them in a turmoil and mar them, something he is bound to emulate on this spin conducive track as well.</p>
                            <p>Ronit More comes in as well from the side whilst from the opposition we have decided to venture in with their own legspinner, Murugan Ashwin along with M Mohammed, two bowlers who’ll be taking the pace off the ball to get rotations on it and send it down at jus the needed trajectory. Their leading wicket taker with the 12 wickets, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore brings an end to our picks far the day.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Shreyas Gopal will be leading our side out as the captain while Devdutt Padikal is our vice-captain.</p>
