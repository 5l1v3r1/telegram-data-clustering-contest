      <p>SEPANG (Nov 21): Gamuda Land is aiming to open the 18-acre rainforest-themed water theme park at its Gamuda Cove township at Bandar Gamuda Cove here in Selangor by December 2021.</p>
      <p>At a tree planting ceremony today to mark the commencement of work for the theme park, the developer said the park will offer a total of 18 water rides with special features, more than 50 different types of international and local cuisine, a 300-metre lazy river, a twin surf beach pool with private cabanas, simulated surfing, interactive waterplays, stage performances as well as a three- or four- star hotel.</p>
      <p>"Most of the attractions we have selected will either be the world's first, Asia's first or Malaysia's first, to be built and operated by Gamuda Land following The Global Association for the Attractions (IAAPA) safety standards," Gamuda Land Director of Leisure and Hospitality Aaron Soo told reporters after the ceremony.</p>
      <p>"For example, there will be the first water ride with VR (virtual reality) and the first interactive slide in Malaysia," he added.</p>
      <p>in line with its rainforest theme, 70% of the water theme park will be planted with tropical trees, shrubs and flora.</p>
      <p>The company has set aside an investment of RM350million to develop the Water Theme Park, of which RM90million will be spent on installing the rides.</p>
      <p>All members of Gamuda Land's GL Friends programme will be able to enjoy discounts and promotions at the theme park.</p>
      <p>"We want to differentiate ourselves from others. Our strategy is to introduce rides that are currently not available on the market, so that we could be the leader," he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the 23-acre Discovery Park at Gamuda Cove will be open on Dec 14 while the Paya Indah Wetlands is scheduled to be opened in early-2020. Jointly operated by Gamuda Cove and the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, Peninsular Malaysia (Perhilitan), the wetlands is being rebranded as the Discovery Wetlands. "Visitors can look forward to raw and rustic activities such as cycling, fishing, bird watching, horse riding and bamboo trail walking at the wetlands," said Soo.</p>
      <p>The 1,530-acre Gamuda Cove township is located in the southern corridor of Klang Valley, along the North-South Expressway Central Link (Elite Highway). The township is situated close to Cyberjaya, KLIA, klia2, wetlands and forest reserves.</p>
      <p>"These investments on place-making, such as building theme parks, is part of Gamuda Land's effort to attract people here. Nowadays buyers have lots of choices, so we want to differentiate ourselves," Gamuda Land chief operating officer Aw Sei Cheh said.</p>
