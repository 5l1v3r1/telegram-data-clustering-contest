      <p>Meanwhile, with <i>Bala</i> Ayushmann Khurrana has registered his seventh consecutive success and he is not stopping here at all. He wants to continue doing the “best films”.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot of hunger to do the best films. It is something that drives me, motivates me to seek out good, new, disruptive cinema and better myself as an actor.</p>
      <p>“They say you learn a lot through your successes and this current phase has told me that I should always push the content envelope and pick and back edgy stories because somehow my brand of cinema has become synonymous with something that’s a little left of centre,” Ayushmann said to IANS.</p>
      <p>Ayushmann made his Bollywood debut with “<i>Vicky Donor</i>” in 2012 and since then he has been featured in several films. After the success of “<i>Bala</i>“, he maintains an enviable track record of 9 successes out of 13 releases.</p>
