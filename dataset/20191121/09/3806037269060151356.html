      <p>Known for its numerous team ups, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/neek-lurk">Neek Lurk</a>‘s brainchild <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/anti-social-social-club">Anti Social Social Club</a> is gearing up for a new collaborative endeavour with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/mattel">Mattel</a>‘s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/hot-wheels">Hot Wheels</a>.</p>
      <p>Shared via <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/assc">ASSC</a>‘s personal Instagram account, the image spotlights both Anti Social Social Club and Hot Wheels iconography surrounded by white dots on a blue background. The post is simply captioned, “11.23.19,” referring to the date of unveiling. So far no other details have been shared, but going by past ASSC collabs, fans can expect a range of co-branded apparel and accessory items, or possibly even toy cars or a larger-scaled automobile for show.</p>
      <p>The Hot Wheels x <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/anti-social-social-club">Anti Social Social Club</a> collaboration is slated to be unveiled this Saturday, November 23. Keep it locked here for more details when they surface.</p>
      <p>For more upcoming collabs, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/sacai-nike-ldwaffle-black-white-leather-suede-first-look">sacai and Nike may have a new LDWaffle on the way</a>.</p>
