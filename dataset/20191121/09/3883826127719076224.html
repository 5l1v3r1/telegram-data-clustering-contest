        <b>Dozens of British Airways flights into the UK have been delayed or cancelled after what the airline has described as a "technical issue".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Flights from the US, India and Japan were showing up as delayed.</p>
      <p>"Our teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue which is affecting some of our flights," BA said on Twitter, in response to a passenger who had been delayed.</p>
      <p>Some people have been put up in hotels and booked on other flights, it said.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Gatwick Airport, where a number of BA flights have arrived late, blamed the delays on an issue with the airline's system for handling flight plans.</p>
      <p>They said the problem caused delays of around three hours for some long-haul flights arriving into the airport, which had a knock-on effect on departures.</p>
      <p>The worst affected was Flight BA170 from Pittsburgh, in the US, which was more than 12 hours behind schedule.</p>
      <p>It is the latest technical issue to affect the airline, which faced massive disruption in August when more than 100 flights were cancelled because of an IT glitch.</p>

      <p>British Airways was hit by its first ever pilot strike in September when flight crews walked out in a row over pay and conditions.</p>
      <p>Later that month, the airline revealed the industrial action had cost it at least €137m (£121m).</p>
