        <b>Never underestimate the power of BTS fans as they’ve managed to send the K-Pop group’s entire catalogue of music into the iTunes albums chart after they failed to receive a single Grammy nomination.</b>
      </p>
      <p>BTS Army were disappointed and upset to learn that the Boy With Luv singers had been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/bts-army-drags-disgraceful-grammys-k-pop-stars-fail-get-nominated-11189208/">completely snubbed from this year’s Grammys</a> when the nominations were revealed on Wednesday, despite enjoying a stellar year of world domination.</p>
      <p>Well they immediately united in their droves to stream BTS’ entire collection of albums in a bid to get them to chart. Their efforts weren’t in vain as each of the band’s albums entered the US iTunes top 1000 albums chart within hours.</p>
      <p>Map Of The Stars: Persona soared 35 places to number 24 while Love Yourself: Tear jumped a staggering 151 places to its new position at number 239.</p>

      <p>The group’s 2016 album Wings was propelled an incredible 856 places to number 568 while their EP Skool Luv Affair, released in 2014, was boosted to number 382.</p>
      <p>No doubt Jimin, V, RM, Suga, Jin, Jungkook and J-Hope appreciate the effort, guys.</p>
      <p>Listing the group’s unmatched achievements, one fan stated in an all-caps rant: ‘WHO SOLD OUT STADIUM. 74.8M VIEWS IN JUST 24/7 HOURS. CERTIFIED RIAA PLATINUM. ONLY GROUP WHO TAUGHT US TO LOVE OURSELVES.</p>

      <p>‘THE ONLY KPOP GROUP WHO CAME FROM A SMOL COMPANY AND BECOMES THE BIGGEST BOY BAND IN THE WORLD.’</p>
      <p>Another added: ‘You guys won in life. You are always in the first place for us, you are always winners for us. Whatever happens, we will continue to love and support you even more. You guys are the best for us in everything.’</p>

      <p>In a now-deleted tweet, the American popstar said: ‘I just woke up and the biggest song of my career wasn’t nominated either. Can u guys not take ur anger out on me for once or [sic].</p>
      <p>‘Deleting and ignoring all negativity. BTS deserved many nominations.</p>
      <p>‘I am however, unsurprised that they weren’t acknowledged. the US is so far behind on the whole movement. the time will come.’</p>
