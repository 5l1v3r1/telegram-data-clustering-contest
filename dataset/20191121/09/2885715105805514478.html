      <h1>Rajiv Gandhi case convict Robert Payas granted parole for son’s wedding</h1>
      <h2>This is the first parole Payas has been granted in 28 years.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:38:01+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-web-desk/" target="_blank">Express Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>Robert Payas, one of the seven people serving life term in the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rajiv-gandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</a> assassination case, was granted month-long parole by the Madras High Court Thursday.</p>
      <p>A division bench of justices MM Sundresh and RMT Teekaa Raaman gave the order for the parole, from November 25 till December 24. Payas had sought the relief to make arrangements for the wedding of his son, Thamizhco.</p>
      <p>This is the first parole Payas has been granted in 28 years.</p>
      <p>The petitioner had in his plea in September submitted that he had been in prison since August 16, 1991, and had completed actual imprisonment of more than 28 years. During this period, Payas said he had not utilised the emergency or ordinary leave provided to him under Tamil Nadu Suspension of Sentence Rules, 1982 despite his good conduct in the prison.</p>
      <p>Conditions of the parole include a bar on him interacting with the media, political parties or personalities, and an undertaking to keep good conduct and not disrupt public peace. Payas has been instructed to stay at Kottivakkam in Chennai and provide the details of his lodging to the police. He has to turn himself in to prison authorities once the duration of his parole is up.</p>
      <p>Payas is one among seven people — Murugan, Santhan, Perarivalan, S Jayakumar and Nalini — convicted and given a life sentence in connection with the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Madras High Court had granted paroles to Nalini Sriharan and Perarivalan. Nalini had been given a 30-day parole in July after she argued her plea in person, seeking the relief to make arrangements for her daughter’s wedding.</p>
