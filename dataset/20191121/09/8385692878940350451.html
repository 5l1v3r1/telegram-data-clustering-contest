      <p>Best Buy has <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">brought</a> the AMD-powered HP Chromebook 14 back down to its lowest price ever in this pre-Black Friday sale. It is now just $199. That's $50 off of its regular price tag.</p>
      <p>This Chromebook from HP is a bit different than many of the others out there. That is because it is one of the first to be powered by an AMD chipset, the A4-9120C dual-core processor, to be exact. That is going to give you better battery life, while keeping the same performance that a Chromebook needs. It's also going to make the Android apps run smoother. Since Android apps already run on ARM-based chipsets, for smartphones.</p>
      <p>Other internals for the HP Chromebook 14 include 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. That is going to be plenty of storage for a Chromebook, seeing as most of your content is going to be saved in the cloud, in Google Drive. That storage is really for cache and for installing Android apps.</p>

      <p>It runs on a 14-inch 1366Ã—768 resolution display. Not the best looking display out there, but for this price, you can't be surprised. It's also not a touchscreen panel from HP. So it's not a 2-in-1, unfortunately. But again, for under $200, that's not a surprise.</p>
      <p>Battery life on the HP Chromebook 14 is pretty good too, we're looking at over 10 hours on a single charge. You can likely get 14 hours, but 10 hours is a decent number for those that might use it pretty heavily.</p>
      <p>All this in a body that measures in at less than an inch thick, and weighs in at under four pounds. We're looking at 3.4lbs to be exact. That's a pretty lightweight Chromebook, and good for carrying around.</p>
