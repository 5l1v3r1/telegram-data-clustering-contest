      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/1514"/>Forum user Blair at 3DCenter had a sharp eye noticed an added entry towards the drivers for Muli-GPU rendering, the technique is called CFR and basically slices up a frame in many small pieces, in order for the GPUs the render them in a parallel manner.</p>
      <p>You could also refer to the technique as checkerboard rendering, where you split everything up into smaller tiles and have the GPUs render them based on an algorithm or simply, FIFO, first-in, fist-out, this could increase scaling performance but also helps with things like micro stuttering as frames and their output pacing are processed in way more stable manner. The basis is, of course, an existing technique applied in many solutions. NVIDIA, however, wants to use if for multi-GPU rendering.</p>
      <p>Apparently Nvidia has not thrown away MultiGPU solutions, which kind of matches the earlier rumors the <a href="https://www.guru3d.com/news-story/nvidia-next-gen-gpu-hopper-could-be-offered-in-chiplet-design.html">new generation called hopper</a>, here a technology like this could be applied. </p>
      <p>Since CFR is currently activated with the help of extra tools and/or requires some manual work at Tweaking. The results and entries that NVIDIA is actively working on this methodology. The new technique would be DirectX compatible only, and as it seems for Turning and upcoming based GPUs as it will require NVLink.</p>
