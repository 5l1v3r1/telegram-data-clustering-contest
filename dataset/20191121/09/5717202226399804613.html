      <h1>Leeds United must stop unlucky Izzy Brown from showing what he’s capable of this weekend</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea loanee played just 11 minutes of football for Leeds United last season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:45:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United take on Luton Town at the weekend and will have to stop a familiar face if they are to be successful at Kenilworth Road. </p>
      <p>Izzy Brown has been a hit with the Hatters since his loan move to the club from Chelsea in the summer. </p>
      <p>That came after a fairly unhappy 12 months at Elland Road. It was always a gamble for Leeds to bring in the former Huddersfield Town loanee and it was a roll of the dice that did not pay off. </p>
      <p>Brown arrived still recovering from a serious knee injury and his recovery from that injury was delayed by further hamstring trouble. </p>
      <p>In the end, Brown played just 11 minutes of football for Leeds United and the lowlight of his time at Elland Road will be his skyed free-kick in the crucial stages of the club’s miserable play-off defeat to Derby County. </p>

      <p>But his time at Leeds has at least helped him get back to full fitness and Luton are now reaping the benefits. </p>
      <p>Brown has provided six assists in 15 appearances for the club this season and is one of their main sparks in attack. </p>
      <p>He should be fit, having missed Luton’s last game before the international break with a knock, and will undoubtedly want to show Leeds what he can do when at his best. </p>
      <p>Leeds fans will not begrudge him such success, as long as they come away with all three points. </p>
