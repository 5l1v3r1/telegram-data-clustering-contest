      <h1>Lidl unveil bargain Black Friday deals - including insanely cheap Xbox One S</h1>
      <h2>Lidl is selling a bargain Xbox One S with three digital games - and we can't find it for anywhere near as cheap elsewhere</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:53:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p>Already famous for their impressive price points, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lidl">Lidl</a> has just announced that it's about to get even cheaper, as the affordable supermarket will officially be taking part in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday 2019.</a></p>
      <p>But rather than offering price cuts on its already market-leading food, it seems that most of Lidl's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday</a> discounts will be on tech and electricals - and decent ones at that.</p>
      <p>The best deal of the lot is surely their Xbox bundle, which nets you the Xbox One S Digital 1TB, along with three digital games for £129, down from £199.99.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere online, the same Xbox One S console - minus any additional games - will still set you back a hefty <a href="https://amzn.to/2Otc9ga">£189.99 at Amazon,</a> <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fxbox-one-s-all-digital-edition-1tb-with-wireless-controller-minecraft-sea-of-thieves-and-forza-horizon-3-games-digital-editions-%2Fp4127192&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Flidl-unveil-bargain-black-friday-20926920">£199 at John Lewis</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fp%2FXbox-One-S-1-TB-All-Digital-Edition-Console%2F5032173375&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Flidl-unveil-bargain-black-friday-20926920">£160 on eBay.</a></p>

        <figcaption>A great price - if you can get it</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But being Lidl, there's likely to be limited stock, with customers warned that they'll be limited to one per person, so we recommend getting to the story very early on the day it goes live, on Black Friday itself (Friday 29 November).</p>
      <p>It's also worth noting that as the Xbox One S console in question is the all digital edition, it doesn't have a disk drive, as £129 is still a lot of money to spend on something if you'll just be left disappointed.</p>

      <p>Unveiled in the retailer's weekly magazine and spotted by bargain hunters on deals forum <a href="https://www.hotukdeals.com/deals/xbox-one-s-digital-with-3-games-129-at-lidl-on-black-friday-3335918">HotUKDeals</a> , Lidl has revealed that it will be offering price cuts on everything from Xbox consoles, to coffee machines, to electric toothbrushes, hoovers and even Prosecco. We've picked out some more of our favourite deals from Lidl's Black Friday sale event below, along with how much they cost elsewhere.</p>
