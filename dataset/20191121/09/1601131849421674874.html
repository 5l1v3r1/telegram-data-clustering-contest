      <h1>Galaxy S10 Lite, Note 10 Lite, and A51 reportedly launching in December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:12:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Abhijeet M.</a></address>
      <p>A new report from the folks over at <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-a51-s10-note-10-lite-india-launch-december-2019-exclusive/"><i>91Mobiles</i></a> says that Samsung will launch the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-s10-lite/">Galaxy S10 Lite</a>, the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-note-10-lite/">Galaxy Note 10 Lite</a>, and the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-a51/">Galaxy A51</a> in India in December. The three devices fall in different segments and lineups so their launch will probably be a few weeks apart, but it seems a bit implausible that Samsung will be launching the Galaxy Note 10 Lite next month as well.</p>
      <p>We were the first to reveal that Samsung is <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-note-10-lite-samsungs-affordable-galaxy-note/">working on the Galaxy Note 10 Lite</a>, but not a lot of information has surfaced about the device in recent weeks. The Galaxy A51 and Galaxy S10 Lite, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s10-lite-fcc-closer-to-release/">have picked up</a> a <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-a51-bluetooth-certification-brings-it-closer-to-official-launch/">couple of certifications</a> that every smartphone requires before it can make its way to market, and rumors and leaks have also given us complete details on the A51 and S10 Lite spec sheets.</p>
      <p>What we’re getting at here is that we can see the Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy A51 going official in December but not the Galaxy Note 10 Lite, unless the Note 10 Lite is simply an S10 Lite with an S Pen. That is certainly possible, as even the Galaxy S10 Lite is <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-full-galaxy-a91-specs-snapdragon-855-45w-charging/">rumored to be the Galaxy A91 with a different name</a>. But there’s not enough information available right now to prove or disprove that theory.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, we will just have to wait and see how Samsung will handle the launch of the three smartphones. The company doesn’t usually release too many devices in December, but with its renewed strategy of flooding the market with multiple phones, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the S10 Lite, Note 10 Lite, and A51 hit retail shelves next month.</p>
