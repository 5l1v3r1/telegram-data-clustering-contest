      <p>Tottenham are currently occupying 14th position on the Premier League standings and Jose Mourinho has a big job to get Spurs back in the top half of the league.</p>
      <p>Eight games remain until the January transfer window opens, giving Mourinho time to work closely with his squad before deciding on what he believes he needs.</p>

      <p>And according to the report by Spanish newspaper AS, Jose Mourinho has already picked Real Madrid star Gareth Bale as the first player he wants to sign.</p>
      <p>When Jose Mourinho was at Manchester United, he tried to lure Gareth Bale to Old Trafford, but Real Madrid chiefs refused to sell the winger.</p>
