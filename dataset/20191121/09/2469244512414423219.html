      <p>A distraught dog owner has launched an urgent appeal to find his beloved pet after it escaped from a dog box on the back of his truck.</p>
      <p>Simon Mitchelmore set off from his home in Deer Park Road in Dartmouth this morning at 6.50am after believing he had secured his three-year-old fox red cocker spaniel in his box.</p>
      <p>It was only when Simon arrived at Loyton Sporting in Exmoor for a day of shooting that he realised Eley was missing.</p>
      <p>Simon, whose father owns Dartmouth Crab Company, has been desperately retracing his steps in the hope of finding him.</p>
      <p>Gun dog trainer Sue Nicholls, who is trying to reunite them back together, said: “After leaving home, Simon drove through Dartmouth, Totnes and then joined the A38 at Buckfastleigh.</p>
      <p>“The traffic was gridlocked on the way and slow going.</p>
      <p>“Simon thought he securely locked the dog box, but obviously he hadn’t and when he got to the shooting estate the dog was not there.</p>
      <p>“Eley is the most beautiful gun dog. He could be anywhere, but maybe someone has picked him up? He has a microchip which is still in the breeders name so we have told them Eley is missing.</p>
      <p>“I just hope he has not been killed after jumping out of the VW truck."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information can contact Sue on 07855 404506 or Simon on 07967 497022.</p>
