      <p>The grieving best friend of a young boy who tragically drowned in France has described his devastation at the loss of his 'awesome' mate, saying "he was the best".</p>
      <p>Jack Collins grew up with 11-year-old Jake Taylor, who died on holiday with his family in August.</p>
      <p>The Hull boys met when they began Eastfield Primary School together and became fast friends.</p>
      <p>Eleven-year-old Jack says he has been lost without his pal Jake, as he organises a special tribute to commemorate his friend, reports <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/jake-taylor-best-friend-words-3556691">Hull Live</a> .</p>
      <p>Jake, who has been described as the "loveliest, kindest and sweetest of boys there could ever be" was at the La Croix Du Vieux Pont campsite in northern France when the tragedy happened on Thursday, August 22.</p>

      <p>Jake had been on holiday with his parents, Hannah and Lance Taylor, and four brothers, Connor, 13, George, nine, Dexter, four and Arry, one, along with four other families from Hull.</p>
      <p>The schoolboy was swimming with his older brother when he disappeared from view in a lagoon which was packed with hundreds of holiday-makers and huge inflatables.</p>
      <p>British doctors on the beach stepped in to try to save him, performing CPR until paramedics arrived.</p>
      <p>Jake was airlifted to hospital, but did not survive. French authorities are investigating the death.</p>
      <p>Jack was left devastated by the loss of his best pal.</p>
      <p>He said: "I used to play with Jake every day on our Xbox's, we would call each other up on Whatsapp and talk for hours.</p>
      <p>"We were awesome together, we understood each other, we laughed, a lot, we worked together to battle on Fortnight, but most importantly we were best friends.</p>
      <p>"Since the accident in France I still ask the question of 'why Jake?' to my mum and dad, as he was the best. That's a question I can never answer.</p>
      <p>Jack has organised sponsored 12 mile bike ride in his best friend's memory - and wants people to join him to do something for Jake's family and to bring everyone who knew him togethe.</p>
      <p>He has organised a bike ride from Sutton to Hornsea, which he hopes dozens of people will join in with, and made a plea for support and sponsorship.</p>
      <p>Jack said: "My best friend was Jake Taylor, we went to Eastfield Primary School together. Sadly, in August Jake lost his life to an accident in France.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"Ever since that day I have wanted to do something for Jake's family and raise some money to help them. I wanted to give something back to Jake's family as I know how much Jake's family meant to him.</p>
      <p>"There is not much I could give but hugs and 'look after yourself' chats, but I wanted to give them more so I felt like I was helping.</p>
      <p>"I decided that I wanted to do a sponsored bike ride to raise money for Jake and his family, but also to bring everyone together who loved him.</p>
      <p>"To do this ride I would like as much sponsorship as possible, whether that be riding, helping us cross roads or meeting us at the end of the trail.</p>

      <p>"Please help sponsor this ride. The more money we raise we can help Jake's family, get them the support they need and let them know we are all thinking of them."</p>
      <p>"Once at Hornsea we are going to play Jake's favourite song while letting off a number of balloons in Jake's favourite colour, blue."</p>
      <p>Jake's mum and dad, Hannah and Lance Taylor are touched by Jack's remarkable gesture for his best friend.</p>
      <p>Hannah said: "Me and Lance just want to say how much of a very special young man Jack is and he makes us both smile and Jake loved him so much.</p>
      <p>"They really was best friends and Lance getting out on his bike to practice has done him a lot of good."</p>
      <p>The bike ride - which is open to all - will see the group cycle 12 miles from Sutton to Hornsea on Saturday, December 7.</p>
      <p>All riders will meet in the car park in the Barbara Robson playing fields at 9.30am.</p>
      <p>Once at Hornsea everyone will meet at the beach front where there will be a number of balloons with personal messages to Jake.</p>
