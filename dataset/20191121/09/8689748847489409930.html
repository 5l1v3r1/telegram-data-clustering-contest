      <h1>AKA congratulates Burna Boy on his Grammy nomination amidst their feud</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:57:19+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>South African rapper, AKA has congratulated his old friend, now enemy, Burna Boy on his Grammys nomination.</p>
      <p>The one-time best friends kicked up a fuss over Burna Boy’s comments in the wake of xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Since then, the two have not been on talking terms and their social media mentions have ceased.</p>
      <p>The Afrobeats star who was yesterday nominated in the Best World Album category for the 62nd Grammy Awards alongside Altin Gün for Gece, Bokanté &amp; Metropole Orkest Conducted By Jules Buckley for What Heat, Nathalie Joachim With Spektral Quartet for Fanm D’Ayiti, and Angelique Kidjo for Celia was congratulated by many musicians in Africa but AKA was yet to show his support for Burna Boy.</p>
      <p>A fan asked AKA what he has to say after his friend Burna Boy was nominated in the Grammys, he quickly replied: <b>“CONGRATULATIONS … obviously.”</b></p>
