      <p><b>By Bhavik Patel<br/></b><br/><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Retail-inflation">Retail inflation</a> is at a 16-month high and is above RBI’s target rate of 4 per cent. So going forward the central bank has limited elbow room for a rate cut.</p>
      <p>If we look at 10-year government bond yield, it is trading near support zone so there are less chances of yield tumbling.</p>
      <p>This means <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/bond-market">bond market</a> has already assumed that further rate cuts are not coming or will be sparse.</p>

      <p>The market will now focus on September quarter GDP number due on November 29, which will further indicate a deeper slowdown in the economy. RBI will have to act and may ignore a temporary rise in food prices to deliver another 25-40 bps rate cut before getting into prolonged pause. Both RBI and Moody’s have lowered GDP forecast. The rupee had broken the range of 71.40-70.80 after India’s factory output contracted 4.3% in September, which was at a 8-year low.</p>
      <p>Not just Indian unit, but other currencies too are facing headwinds. Brazil’s real is near to a historic low, while its stock market is near historic high. As we can see from the chart, South African rand, Chinese Offshore yuan and Indian rupee, all are trading in close proximity against US Dollar meaning not just our currency but all other units are also depreciating.</p>

      <p>The rupee is not overbought as RSI 14 is still at 61. The currency is trading above 200-DMA and has broken its previous swing high of 71.80. Next resistance and target come at 72.63. We believe the rupee may only appreciate if it closes below 71. Since August it is trading above 200-DMA and currently above 20 and 50-DMA, indicating trend is up. Any correction till 71.40 should be bought into and long positions should only be exited below 71.</p>
