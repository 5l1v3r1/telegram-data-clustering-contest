      <h1>James Corden Gets a Little Help From Kristen Bell and the Frozen Cast For Crosswalk Musical</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:40:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author">Karenna Meredith</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Kristen-Bell">Kristen Bell</a>, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, and Josh Gad ventured "into the unknown" for James Corden's <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/James-Corden-Crosswalk-Musical-Cast-Aladdin-Video-46199885">"Crosswalk the Musical"</a> on Wednesday night â€” and by "unknown" I mean LA traffic. On <b>The Late Late Show</b>, the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Frozen-2"><b>Frozen 2</b></a> cast members revived some of the most iconic moments from the original Disney film and its sequel while battling against the true powers of evil: unhappy drivers.</p>
      <p>Bell played a real-life version of Princess Anna, while Corden got into character as her sister, Elsa (even though Idina Menzel was right there with them). Their quick rendition of "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?" is not to be missed, <i>especially</i> when they're required to clear the road in seconds flat. Those performers fled the road faster than a flurry of snowflakes! It's already easy to be impressed by these actors, but watch the video above and you'll gain some newfound respect.</p>
