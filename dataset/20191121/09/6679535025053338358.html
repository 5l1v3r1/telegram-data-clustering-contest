      <p>Over 150 patients have been treated in the last four months at Apollo Hospitals here, using a new technique called endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH), to perform coronary artery bypass grafting, popularly known as bypass surgery, said V. Sridhar, chief surgeon of the hospital on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The EVH technique is very useful in a heart bypass surgery, where patients require a bypass to reroute and improve blood flow to the heart. The vein used for heart bypass surgery is usually removed from the leg, for which an incision is done on the patient’s leg from the ankle to the top of the thigh. “Usually, patients suffer a lot of pain, swelling and some people even find it tough to walk after the procedure,” said Dr. Sridhar.</p>
      <p>He said that with the use of the new technique, there is no need for a long incision on the patient’s leg. Instead, a two-inch incision is made and the vein is removed from the leg using a telescope. “The use of the technique has resulted in faster recovery of the patients. They also undergo less trauma and the scar length is almost invisible for patients. The technique ensures reduced risk of infections and it is especially useful for diabetic patients,” he said.</p>
      <p>Rohini Sridar, chief operating officer, Apollo Hospitals, Madurai Division and Samuel, senior general manager (Operations) of the hospital also participated.</p>
