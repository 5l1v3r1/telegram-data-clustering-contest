      <p>Cape Town - South Africa's <b>Darren Fichardt </b>has earned his <b>European Tour</b> card for next season at the Tour's Qualifying School Final Stage at the Lumine Golf Club in Spain.</p>
      <p>Fichardt shot a final-round 69 to finish on 13-under par to sit in 22nd position - as Denmark's Benjamin Poke <a href="https://www.europeantour.com/european-tour/final-qualifying-stage-lumine-2019/results?round=6">ran away with the title</a>.</p>
      <p>Only 28 players earned their life-changing European Tour cards.</p>
      <p>Fichardt was the only South African out of the 12-man contingent who made it through to the Final Qualifying Stage to secure his card.</p>
      <p>Those missing out included Wilco Nienaber, Louis de Jager, Bryce Easton, Garrick Higgo, JC Ritchie, Daniel van Tonder, Neil Schietekat, Jacques Kruyswijk, Trevor Fisher Jnr, Garth Mulroy and Jake Roos.</p>
      <p>The 2019 European Tour Qualifying School was contested over 252 holes in three stages across 14 different venues.</p>
      <p>A record number of 1 063 entrants bid for one of the coveted European Tour cards, surpassing the previous record of 1 026 from 2017.</p>
      <p>Fichardt is a five-time European Tour winner with his last victory coming at the Joburg Open in 2017.</p>
      <p>Fichardt will compete on the European Tour throughout the 2020 season, starting with the Alfred Dunhill Championship from November 28-December 1.</p>
