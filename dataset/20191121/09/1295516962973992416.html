      <h1>Snyder Shares Photo of Gal Gadot Seeing Young Darkseid for the First Time</h1>

      <p>Zack Snyder has slowly revealed much of his original vision for 2017's <a href="http://www.cbr.com/tag/justice-league">Justice League</a> over the last year, excitedly describing how Darkseid was supposed to make his debut in the DCEU. Unfortunately, plans changed after the directorÂ was forced to exit during production due to a family tragedy. He was replaced with director Joss Whedon who brought with him a multitude of changes to <i>Justice League</i>.</p>
      <p>Snyder recently posted a new image on <a href="https://vero.co/zacksnyder/MmgD-RjrcvD4Bs7MBLpRg12T">Vero</a>, featuring Gal Gadot in the middle of an ADR session, in front of a screen bearing the image of an early CGI render of Darkseid. Snyder accompanied the image with the caption, "That time in January 2017 when Diana came face to face with Uxas for the first time," once again referring to the classic comic book supervillain by his birth name.</p>

      <p>In the theatrical release of <i>Justice League</i>, there is a flashback sequence in which Steppenwolf and his horde invades Earth. It's narrated by Diana as she explains the film's villain to Bruce Wayne. It is uncertain whether or not Snyder's photo captures work on that sequence or if the image and its caption implies that Wonder Woman was actually supposed to confront the New God at one point.</p>
      <p>This image was released soon after calls for Warner Bros. to release the "Snyder Cut" gained new prominence, following expressed support from some of the film's stars, including Gal Gadot, Ben Affleck, Jason Mamoa and Ray Porter, the latter of which portrayed Darkseid in unreleased footage. Warner Bros. and DC have stated that there are currently no plans to release the cut.</p>
