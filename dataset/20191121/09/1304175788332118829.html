      <h4>Boeing, Republic of Ghana sign Memorandum of Understanding for three 787-9 Dreamliner jets</h4>
      <p>DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES -<b> Boeing </b>and the Republic of Ghana announced that the country intends to re-launch an airline starting with the 787-9 Dreamliner. The parties signed a memorandum of understanding at the Dubai Air Show for three airplanes with a list price value of $877.5 million according to list prices.</p>
      <p>"<i>There is a growing demand for air travel to and from Ghana and we believe the advanced 787-9 Dreamliner gives us an efficient and flexible machine to launch a regional network and eventually serve international destinations in the future</i>," said <b>Joseph Kofi Adda</b>, Honorable Minister of Aviation and Member of Parliament, Republic of Ghana. "<i>The 787 has an excellent reputation for its operational performance, fuel efficiency and passenger experience and we are confident that we have the right partner for our new carrier</i>."</p>
      <p>Adda says the carrier, to be based in Accra, would establish the capital city as a strategic hub that serves cities across West Africa. Future routes would include destinations in Europe, North America and Asia and the long-term plan is to open the airline to private investment and operation.</p>
      <p>"<i>Africa boasts a growing, young workforce and vast natural resources. We see the demand for air travel continuing to rise across the continent. Boeing is honored to work with Ghana in helping re-launch an airline to serve this vast market</i>," said <b>Ihssane Mounir</b>, senior vice president of Commercial Sales &amp; Marketing for The Boeing Company. "<i>We look forward to working with the government on an integrated solution that includes the 787-9 Dreamliner and aviation services to support the new airline and provide a superior experience for its future passengers</i>."</p>
      <p>The 787-9 is part of a family of three airplanes that offer long ranges and unmatched fuel efficiency in the 200 to 350 seat market. The 787-9 can carry 296 passengers and fly up to 7,530 nautical miles (13,950 kms), while reducing fuel use and emissions by 20 to 25 percent compared to older airplanes.</p>
      <p>Since entering service in 2011, the 787 family has enabled the opening of more than 250 new point-to-point routes and saved 45 billion pounds of fuel. Every day, there are more than 1,600 commercial flights on a 787 Dreamliner. This means that somewhere in the world a 787 Dreamliner takes off every minute. To date, more than 400 million passengers have flown on the airplane.</p>
