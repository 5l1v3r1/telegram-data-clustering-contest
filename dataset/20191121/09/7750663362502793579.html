      <p>The 56-year-old, following almost a year out of management, was <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/tottenham-confirm-jose-mourinho-as-new-manager_379969.html">appointed as Spurs boss</a> on Wednesday following the sacking of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/jose-mourinho-holds-harry-kane-talks_380048.html">It is claimed</a> that Mourinho, during his first training session at Enfield, spoke privately and at length with Kane.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, Mourinho has told Levy that Kane is a vital part of his plan and must not countenance his sale under any circumstances.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/transfer-talk/news/dawson-fears-kane-spurs-exit_380035.html">Some have speculated</a> that Kane would look to seek pastures new over the summer in order to pursue winning trophies.</p>
      <p>Kane, who has six goals in the Premier League this term, recently <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/kane-proud-to-sign-new-spurs-contract_327888.html">penned a new deal</a> at the North London club until 2024.</p>
