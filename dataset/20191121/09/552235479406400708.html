      <h1>Rae, from Carluke, stars in award winning fashion film 'Fashion in the Dark'</h1>
      <h2>Rae lost her sight in 2017 and struggled to find her identity in the clothes she was wearing.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:41:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:41</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Pringle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-pringle/</a></address>
      <p>A fashionista who lost her sight has revealed how she struggled with her image as she tried to come to terms with not being able to see.</p>
      <p>Rae Walker, from Carluke, is one of two women who are visually impaired to star in Fashion in the Dark.</p>
      <p>The short film recently scooped the best fashion film award at the Fashion Film Festival in Milan.</p>
      <p>Rae’s love for clothes and make-up seemed to her to be entirely pointless when she lost the ability to see two years ago.</p>
      <p>She was just 22 years old when she lost her sight in 2017 and admits that as well as losing her vision she lost her sense of identity for a time.</p>
      <p>Rae openly admits that for the first few months she didn’t see any point in bothering about the clothes she was wearing, colouring her hair, or having her nails painted because she couldn’t see them.</p>
      <p>She said: “I couldn’t be bothered buying any new clothes. I knew the clothes in my wardrobe, I knew what they looked like but I was not interested and I didn’t care.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Then I realised I was being silly. I had to find my own way to come to terms with it.</p>
      <p>“Now I don’t care if I can’t see my clothes or my hair. I loved fashion when I could see and I still know what blue and pink look like.</p>
      <p>“When somebody describes the shades, I can see them in my head.”</p>
      <p>Fashion in the Dark has already also been screened at festivals in New York, London and Sydney as well as being screened at the National Museum of Scotland.</p>
      <p>In the film Rae and another woman Jill, who is also visually impaired, describe the challenges they face when getting dressed or going shopping.</p>
      <p>Emily, the film’s creator, is a Scot who works as a fashion lecturer at Edinburgh College of Art. She was inspired to make the film after noting that her students worked almost entirely online in a two-dimensional way. She pondered how to get them to step back from their computers and pay more attention to textures.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Emily got in touch with Rae through a charity, and the Carluke woman came and met up with her and the students.</p>
      <p>“My students were born into the internet and have information at the touch of a screen,” said Emily.</p>
      <p>“They did everything online, from designing to ordering fabrics.</p>
      <p>“I wanted students to make full use of all their senses. I felt it was important for them to view the world through the varied experiences of their customers — particularly a customer who might experience fashion in a very different way to them.”</p>
      <p>Rae’s mum helps her with buying her clothes now whether that be online or in-store, as she knows what she does and doesn’t like and can help her navigate past the pitfalls of both.</p>
      <p>Rae added: “I still love shopping but it’s hard.</p>
      <p>“Online, I will picture something but it doesn’t look like that at all.</p>
      <p>“I have to ask my mum and then she will describe it to me and it’s nothing at all like I imagined.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I depend heavily on my mum. She’s the only person I trust who knows my fashion tastes.</p>
      <p>“Other people see the world differently. What they perceive as nice I might find horrible.”</p>
      <p>She knows what’s in her wardrobe and can identify garments by their texture. If she isn’t sure then she gives it a miss, rather than wear colours that clash.</p>
      <p>“If I wanted to wear all pink one day and thought I was wearing a pink jumper and my pink skinny jeans, and it turned out I was wearing a green jumper, I would be horrified,” she continued.</p>
      <p>“If I went out wearing clashing colours, people would say, ‘The poor wee blind girl can’t dress herself.’”</p>
      <p>“I don’t even think of myself as blind most of the time.</p>
      <p>“I think of myself as just a normal girl.”</p>
