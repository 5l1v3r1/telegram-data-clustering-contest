      <p>A big-hearted youngster climbed a mountain which inspired the name of the cancer ward her sister was treated at — raising an incredible £700.</p>
      <p>Hannah Thomson, 12, made it her mission to reach the summit of Schiehallion in a bid to raise cash for the Schiehallion Ward at the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>The unit, which treats children for cancer and blood disorders, has been a lifeline for her eight-year-old sister Sarah, who was diagnosed with leukaemia when she was just a toddler.</p>

      <p>Thoughtful Hannah, a pupil at the Vale of Leven Academy, has now raised more than £1000 for the ward, having also held a fundraising cake sale in 2016 which raised almost £450.</p>

      <p>Proud mum Karen Lowrey, who is also mum to 13-year-old Daniel, said: “Hannah has been wanting to climb Schiehallion for so long.</p>
      <p>“The ward have a family day every year where patients, families and staff climb the mountain, which it was named after.</p>
      <p>“We have been along on the day and do activities on the bottom like building dens.</p>
      <p>“Previously, we didn’t get to climb it because we would get the bus down from the hospital and it would be too late by the time we would get there.</p>
      <p>“But this year, we stayed overnight and me and Hannah did it.</p>
      <p>“I am so proud of her. She is so thoughtful.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The family planted a tree at the foot of the mountain in 2015, alongside a tag and photographs of themselves, and they were thrilled to find everything was still intact on their recent visit.</p>
      <p>Karen said: “A lot of the others had been destroyed so that was really nice to see ours was still in good condition. It was a really special day.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.lennoxherald.co.uk/">Lennox Herald</a> told of Sarah’s story three years ago after the remarkable little girl battled cancer and fought back from the brink after her heart stopped beating for six minutes.</p>
      <p>The youngster, from Renton, was rushed to hospital on her first day of nursery and worried mum Karen was crushed when a blood test showed the three-year-old had cancer.</p>
      <p>She had been unwell for around four weeks, and back and forth to see doctors, before the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was picked up by the medical team.</p>
      <p>But little Sarah faced her gruelling treatment – including regular chemotherapy and painful lumbar punctures – head on.</p>

      </p>
      <p>One side-effect of the chemo for Sarah meant she lost reflexes and had to learn to walk again. And the outgoing youngster also shed all of her hair.</p>
      <p>Despite all this and to the amazement of her family, the youngster, who goes to Renton primary language unit, bounced back with a smile on her face.</p>
      <p>Karen added: “Sarah is doing great. I always remember how the doctors were amazed by the fact she was up and about when her haemoglobin levels were low. They thought the reading must have been wrong because they said most kids would be bedridden but it wasn’t. That’s Sarah – she is so strong.</p>
      <p>“I’m so proud of all my children. It’s been really hard for them as they have missed out on things but we are sort of normal now.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to do what we can for the Schiehallion Ward.</p>
      <p>“They have what they call fairy boxes which are filled with little toys. The idea is that the children can pick something from the box when they need a boost.</p>
      <p>“We like to help fill them up throughout the year. They are a brilliant idea and provide comfort to the children.”</p>
      <p>Hannah is hoping to present the cheque to Glasgow Children’s Hospital, which runs the unit, at the Vale of Leven Academy soon.</p>
