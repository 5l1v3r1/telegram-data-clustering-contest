      <p>Human Rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), has berated the Department of State Services (DSS) for saying that it would not release Omoyele Sowore until the identities of his sureties are verified.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Wednesday, Falana condemned the actions of the service regarding the case of Sowore, noting the continued detention of his client is denting the image of the country.</p>
      <p>According to the Senior Advocate of Nigeria, the court did not authorise the DSS to verify Sowore and Olawale Bakare’s sureties.</p>
      <p>The statement read: “In a very disgraceful statement the sss claimed that Sowore could be knocked down by a moving vehicle if released from illegal custody.</p>
      <p>“Even though the diversionary press conference was deliberately designed to blackmail me I discountenanced and proceeded to honour the appointment.</p>
      <p>“Thus, in a brief meeting with our clients, I informed them that upon the verification of their sureties the federal high court had ordered their release from custody.”</p>
      <p>Falana added that in order to arm his clients to press for their rights, he gave them a certified true copy of the court order for their release which had been served on the SSS management.</p>
      <p>He further stated that his clients debunked the claim of the DSS spokesman that they have been given access to the telephone and other facilities.</p>
      <p>Falana advised the management to restrain Peter Afunanya from further exposing the country to avoidable ridicule in his desperate bid to justify the illegal detention of his clients.</p>
      <p>The SAN said he has decided to report the misconduct of Afunanya to the appropriate agency of the Federal Government for giving false information to members of the public.</p>
