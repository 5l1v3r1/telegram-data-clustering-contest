      <p>Gardaí have made two further arrests in relation to the abduction of Kevin Lunney.</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney suffered life-changing injuries after he was taken from near his home and violently assaulted in September.</p>
      <p>Two men, both 38, were arrested in the Dublin Region today for an offence contrary to Section 73 Criminal Justice Act 2006.</p>
      <p>They are being detained under Section 50 Criminal Justice Act 2007 at Ballymun &amp; Finglas Garda stations.</p>
      <p>The gardaí are continuing to appeal for information, "no matter how insignificant it appears".</p>
      <p>They said anyone with information "on this vicious criminal attack or any other criminal activities which have taken place in the Cavan/Fermanagh border area over recent years to contact An Garda Síochána at Cavan Garda Station 049 4368800, the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111, Crime Stoppers on 1800 25 00 25 or any garda station."</p>
