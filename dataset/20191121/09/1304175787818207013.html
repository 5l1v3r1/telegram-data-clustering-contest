      <p>PARIS – UFI, the <b>Global Association of the Exhibition Industry</b>, has launched its first in-depth research <a href="https://www.ufi.org/archive-research/the-exhibition-industry-in-latam/">study</a> of the exhibition industry in Latin America. The research provides neutral, up-to-date information on the exhibition industry in Latin America, and will support the future activities of UFI members and the wider industry in the region.</p>
      <p>The first edition of the research was released during the UFI Global Congress 2019 in Bangkok, Thailand, on 6-9 November. Covering 17 markets in Latin America, it provides an economic overview of the region and current industry trends, as well as comprehensive data on the exhibition infrastructure across the region.</p>
      <p>A second edition of the research will be released during the UFI Latin America Conference 2020 in Buenos Aires (Argentina) on 20-21 April. This updated edition will be expanded to include data on exhibition organisers, service providers, and convention and visitor bureaus.</p>
      <p>Relevant as of September 2019, the data covered in the report offers real value to existing and potential UFI members who are either operating in Latin America or looking to do business with the region. It will also help to further position UFI as a knowledge leader within the industry.</p>
      <p><b>Jose Navarro </b>Meneses, Regional Chair Latin America says: “<i>We are happy to welcome this report, the first of its kind done by UFI, and a testimony to the ever-growing support UFI provides to its members in Latin America. Over the past two years,  we had a very successful Regional Conference in 2018, and now this essential research report. Both highlight the flourishing exhibition industry in the region and signal the expected benefits of the upcoming UFI Regional Conference in Buenos Aires in April</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>Ana Maria Arango</b>, UFI Regional Manager Latin America, says: “<i>I am pleased to announce this exciting research, which will give companies a clear and in-depth understanding of the entire exhibition industry in Latin America. The region offers an array of opportunities to both local and international businesses, and this research is a key part of UFI’s activities to help to develop the exhibition industry in the future</i>.”</p>
