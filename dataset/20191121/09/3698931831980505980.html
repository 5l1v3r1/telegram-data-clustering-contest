      <p>Huawei Malaysia is introducing a new smartphone very soon and it’s the Huawei Y9s. It features an Ultra FullView Display and a triple-camera setup that has a 48MP main camera.</p>
      <p>The Huawei Y9s hardware is quite similar to the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/07/26/huawei-y9-prime-2019-unboxing-hands-on/">Huawei Y9 Prime 2019</a> and the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/21/honor-9x-malaysia-launch-official-price-skg/">Honor 9X</a>. Based on the <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/y9s/">global spec-sheet</a>, it will come with a 6.59″ Full HD+ display that has a no notches or punch-holes for a more immersive viewing experience. To solve the selfie camera conundrum, it will come with a 16MP f/2.2 pop-up selfie camera.</p>

      <p>The Y9s will be available in Breathing Crystal which is similar to the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/04/02/huawe-p30-p30-pro-malaysia-official-launch-price/">Huawei P30</a> series. If you prefer something darker, it is also offered in Midnight Black. Unlike the Y9 Prime 2019, the Y9s comes with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor which claims to unlock in just 0.3 seconds. The sensor also doubles up as a power button and you can use it to trigger voice-assistant by pressing the button for 1 second.</p>

      <p>Powering the device is a Kirin 710F processor and based on the global product page, it will come with 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage. For taking pictures, the rear gets a triple-camera setup featuring a 48MP f/1.8 main camera, an 8MP f/2.4 ultra-wide-angle lens and a 2MP f/2.4 camera for depth effects.</p>

      <p>Keeping the lights on is a 4,000mAh battery and it charges via USB-C. Also retained is a 3.5mm headphone jack at the bottom. Out of the box, it runs on EMUI 9.1 and if you look at the home screen, you’ll notice that it has Google Play Store and other Google apps pre-installed. That means you can enjoy all of your favourite Android apps hassle-free.</p>
      <p>The local release should be happening soon and we expect Huawei Malaysia to drop more details in the days to come.</p>
