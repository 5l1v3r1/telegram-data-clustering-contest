      <p>Kendall Jenner has 10 nieces and nephews running around, so it’s no surprise she’s a dab hand with a baby.</p>
      <p>And the model showed off her skills as she posed with a fan and their child for a photo in New York.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was spotted smiling as she cuddled the little one on the streets of Manhattan on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Scooping the newborn up, she couldn’t resist holding the baby close to her during the impromptu photoshoot.</p>
      <p>Kenny is the only one of her sisters to not have a child, with Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian both welcoming their first children, Stormi and True, last year.</p>
      <p>While Kourtney shares Mason, Penelope and Reign with ex Scott Disick, and Kim and Kanye West have North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm together.</p>

      <p>‘I’m going to make him do the coolest things, so when he’s older, he’s just a stud.’</p>
      <p>Good to know…</p>
      <p>But, in a chat with People, she insisted she’s in no rush to get pregnant, explaining: ‘I still have years that I want to spend for myself for a little while, but more power to [Kylie].</p>
      <p>‘She is built for this, she is an incredible mum.</p>
      <p>‘There are parts of me that go in and out of [wanting a baby], but I am so okay right now just to live my life. Maybe I’ll have a kid in a couple of years…’</p>
