      <h1>Murray admits being out of shape after Davis Cup scare</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:31:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/reuters" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Former world number one Andy Murray admitted he was not in the best physical shape to open Britain's Davis Cup Finals campaign after narrowly avoiding a shock defeat to unheralded Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old had not played a competitive match since winning the European Open title in Antwerp, his first since returning after having had hip surgery in January.</p>
      <p>He has also been dealing with an elbow injury and becoming a father for the third time and it showed as the 179th-ranked Griekspoor, who played instead of Botic Van de Zandschulp, gave Murray a torrid time on Court 3.</p>
      <p>Murray eventually scrambled to a 6-7(7) 6-4 7-6(5) victory in a match he admitted he had not deserved to win, although it proved crucial in the end as Britain edged home 2-1.</p>
      <p>Afterwards he said he was carrying extra weight around the court. "When I was 25, it's quite easy, after a couple of weeks of practice, it's quicker to get going whereas now it takes a little bit longer," he told reporters.</p>
      <p>"I've made quite big changes to the way I train off the court as well. But the weight and things like that, that's my fault. I've never had that in my career before.</p>
      <p>"If you're weighing four or five kilos more than you're used to, that is probably going to affect how you feel moving around. You go the gym and lift a medicine ball up that's five kilos, it's pretty heavy. So I need to do better with that.</p>
      <p>"That's not anyone else's responsibility."</p>
      <p>Captain Leon Smith said Murray's win had vindicated his decision to play him. "I was proud of how Andy managed to find a way. It obviously proved a crucial rubber win for us," he said.</p>
      <p>There has been a jolly mood around the British camp since arriving in Madrid, where they have been handed a relatively comfortable group along with the Dutch and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>On the eve of the tie they amused themselves by using phrases from the movie Frozen in their press conference.</p>
      <p>But Murray played down suggestions they had taken their opening Group E clash lightly, even if he admitted the late Dutch switch to play the 23-year-old Griekspoor had thrown him.</p>
      <p>"We arrived here a week before our first match, which I think everyone considered to be pretty early," Murray, who also seemed to be suffering with a cold, said.</p>
      <p>"I was taking the match very seriously today. But when you have a child, maybe that becomes your priority for a period of time. Maybe I could have got on the practice courts sooner.</p>
      <p>"A guy serving 180kph second serves makes things difficult."</p>
      <p>While the lack of atmosphere has been criticised at the inaugural 18-nation Finals at La Caja Magica, Murray said he had no complaints so far with the new format even if it lacked the fever-pitch intensity of the 2015 final in Ghent when he inspired Britain to the title with victory over Belgium.</p>
      <p>"The atmosphere is much more intimate on a court like that today. The atmosphere was brilliant," he said.</p>
