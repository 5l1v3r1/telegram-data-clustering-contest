      <p>NEW DELHI: A new chapter is ready to begin in the history of Indian <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">cricket</a> as the country hosts and plays its first ever <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/day-night-Test">day-night Test</a> match, beginning at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> in Kolkata on Friday against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. Calling it a "change that needs to be embraced", former India opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gautam-Gambhir">Gautam Gambhir</a> is looking forward to the momentous occasion.</p>
      <p>Comparing the first pink-ball Test in India to the revolutionary 1992 World Cup in Australia, which was the first edition played in coloured clothing with a white ball, Gambhir hoped that inaugural day-night Test on Indian soil ends up being a spectacle as well.</p>
      <p>"Channel 9 broadcast, seagulls, Richie Benaud and Co behind the mike, Aussie grounds and cricketers in coloured clothing chasing white ball...all this combined to create quite a spectacle," Gambhir mentioned about the 1992 World Cup in his column for The Times of India.</p>
      <p>"I hope pink cricket ball does to Indian cricket what white did," he added.</p>
      <p>The Test will be the second and final game of the two-match series against Bangladesh. India lead the series 1-0, having won the first Test by an innings and 130 runs inside three days.</p>
      <p>"For starters, it is a fantastic marketing initiative. Fans, players, administrators and media are all discussing pink cricket ball. Cricket after office-hours has always worked and I see no reason why Test matches should not," the left-handed former batsman wrote.</p>
      <p>Gambhir, who formed a formidable opening combination with Virender Sehwag in all forms of cricket, admitted that he wouldn't have accepted Test cricket under lights easily but it's the need of the hour.</p>
      <p>"I am a purist and wouldnâ€™t have embraced this idea with ease. But then, the pace and immediacy of T20s has refreshed the temperament of the viewing public.</p>
      <p>"Even as a part of a broadcasting team, I keep thinking what more can I give? What more can I add? In the times of instant cashback, instant food, sports and entertainment need constant innovation. Hence, this change needs to be embraced," the cricketer cum politician, who is also part of the commentary team for the series, added.</p>
      <p>Gambhir also wrote that it signifies the growing respect for Bangladesh cricket that they are part of this historic occasion instead of any big team.</p>
      <p>"Bangladesh should be proud of the fact that they will be a part of a historical moment. I am not sure if their fortunes will improve, but their standing in world cricket will surely improve. Normally such momentous occasions involve teams like Australia, England, etc.; but Bangladesh getting to play the first day-night Test match in India means that they have earned respect in world cricket," Gambhir, the T20 and ODI World Cup winner, concluded.</p>
