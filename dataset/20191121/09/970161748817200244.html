        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has arrived as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> manager with a reputation as a serial winner thanks to his burgeoning trophy cabinet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese has his detractors, but few can argue with the immense success he has achieved throughout his career and since taking charge of Porto in 2002, he has never left a club without delivering them some silverware.</p>
      <p>In Mourinho’s first full season in charge at Porto he delivered the Primeira Liga title, Taca de Portugal and UEFA Cup, retaining the league title and adding the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> the following season.</p>
      <p>This earned him a move to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>, where he won the Premier League and League Cup in his opening season.</p>
      <p>Over his two spells at Stamford Bridge he added another two Premier League, an FA Cup and two more League Cups.</p>
      <p>After leaving the Blues for the first time he went to Inter Milan, picking up two Serie A titles, the Champions League (again) and a Coppa Italia.</p>

      <p>The Portuguese then headed to Real Madrid where he managed one La Liga crown and a Copa del Rey.</p>
      <p>His spell at Manchester United was the only one since Porto that didn’t yield a league title, but Mourinho did claim the Europa League and League Cup (for a fourth time).</p>
      <p>That takes his trophy haul to <b>20.</b></p>
      <p>However, this is not including his Community Shield wins, and its equivalent in other countries.</p>
      <p>Mourinho won the Community Shield once with Chelsea and again with Manchester United, while he also won the Supertaca Candido de Oliveira, Supercoppa Italiana and Supercopa de Espana once each.</p>
      <p>He would probably argue that takes his tally to 25 trophies, but most would leave these out of his collection.</p>
