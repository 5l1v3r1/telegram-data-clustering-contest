      <p>Romon Kimin Yang, who is more commonly known as Rostarr, will be taking over <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/food-drink/the-slow-kitchen-bar-brings-flavorful-twists-to-classics-with-dishes-like-tokyo-hummus-octopus-bolognese-coconut-panna-cotta/">The Slow</a>’s ROOM13 this Saturday with his latest array of creative pieces. </p>
      <p>Born in South Korea in 1971, Yang was raised in the United States since he was one year old. This childhood raised across Asia and America has been a key subject of exploration for the artist, who reflects on his heritage throughout, including his painting, abstract calligraphy, large-scale murals and experimental filmmaking. This weekend, you can see his work in the flesh. </p>
