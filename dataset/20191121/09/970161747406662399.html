      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">…Get Me Out of Here</a>’s newest star Andy Whyment thinks she’s seriously ‘punching above his weight’ with his wife.</p>
      <p>The Coronation Street actor has been married to his wife, Nichola, for 12 years and the couple have been together since they were 14.</p>
      <p>As Andy prepares to enter the jungle as a late entrant to the camp, he’s revealed that he thinks his wife is way out of his league.</p>

      <p>Speaking in the latest issue of OK! Magazine, the 38 year-old discussed his relationship with his wife and mother of his two children.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been punching above my weight for years,’ he said. ‘She’s gorgeous!’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘I’m a very lucky bloke. We’ve been together 14 years and we just don’t argue. We get on so well.’</p>

      <p>After 14 years together, however, we can imagine that poor old Nichola is in need of a break and a break she’s going to get as her husband<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-new-campmates-andy-whyment-and-cliff-parisi-pose-with-aussie-wildlife-ahead-of-jungle-debut-11183275/"> is jetting out Down Under as a late addition to the jungle</a>.</p>
      <p>The Kirk Sutherland actor will be joining fellow soap icon Cliff Parisi (or as you know him, Minty from EastEnders) as they look set to join 2019’s cast, including reality TV icon <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> and Girls Aloud singer <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a>.</p>
      <p>It seems the arrival of some fresh blood in the two camps couldn’t come quicker too. We’ve already had our first bust-up between radio DJs Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts…<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebritys-roman-kemp-and-adele-roberts-clash-as-he-mocks-jane-mcdonalds-legacy-thats-prejudice-11183514/">over a picture of Jane McDonald</a>.</p>
      <p>We’ve also had Bush Tucker trials aplenty, including the first eating challenge of the year. Adele <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebrity-recap-adele-roberts-gags-on-pig-uterus-as-caitlyn-jenner-reveals-shes-treated-differently-as-a-woman-11191546/">had the lovely task of scoffing down some pig’s uterus.</a> Rather her than us!</p>
      <p>This year I’m A Celeb bosses have confirmed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebrity-bosses-ban-live-insects-from-bushtucker-trials-after-animal-rights-backlash-11165998/">contestants will not be chowing down on any live insects during the eating trials</a> – and this will be a permanent change after an animal rights backlash.</p>
