      <p>"This was a huge day in the Ukraine scandal," thanks mostly to Gordon Sondland's "<a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879653/sondland-confirms-quid-pro-quo-points-finger-directly-trump">explosive testimony</a>," Stephen Colbert said on Wednesday's <i>Late Show</i>. The U.S. ambassador to the European Union's "<a href="https://theweek.com/articles/879687/sondland-just-obliterated-trump-entire-white-house-peril">biggest bombshell</a>" was his admission that yes, <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879660/watch-gordon-sondlands-stunning-opening-statement-implicating-trump-quid-pro-quo">there was a "quid pro quo"</a> with Ukraine, President Trump was calling the shots, and a who's who of senior officials "were in the loop," too. Sondland also explained <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879672/gordon-sondland-wont-confirm-deny-key-details-trump-phone-call-kyiv-restaurant">why he called Trump</a> from that restaurant in Kyiv. "Yeah, A$AP Rocky was the primary purpose of the call," Colbert deadpanned, "as in, 'Zelensky better launch the Biden investigation ASAP, or his life's about to get pretty rocky. Put a beat behind that.'"</p>

      <p>"We have moved past Watergate into floodgate," Jimmy Kimmel said on <i>Kimmel Live</i>. Since the beginning, "Trump's been saying Ambassador Sondland will say there was no quid pro quo," but then Sondland testified, "and just like that, Donald Trump's defense disappears faster than he downs a bucket of KFC."</p>
      <p>"Staffers in the White House were <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879819/white-house-trump-campaign-officials-are-reportedly-freaking-about-sondlands-testimony">said to be shocked and blindsided</a> by the testimony this morning, as it appears our president has been caught orange-handed," Kimmel said. "Sondland screwed the president so thoroughly today, Trump reflexively paid him $130,000 to be quiet," and "the vice president, secretary of state, chief of staff, Rick Perry, John Bolton ... they <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879689/even-fox-news-thinks-sondlands-testimony-took-bus-ran-over-president-trump">all went under the bus,</a>" too. Comedian Jeff Ross stepped in to play Sondland, colorfully.</p>

      <p>"Sondland's testimony was explosive, shocking, and jaw-dropping" — just watch <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879997/%22a%20lot%20of%20senior%20officials,%22%20all%20of%20whom%20he%20said%20%22were%20in%20the%20loo">Rep. Devin Nunes' (R-Calif.) slack-jawed reaction</a>, Seth Meyers said at <i>Late Night</i>. He provided "some context for why today was the most shocking day of testimony so far" and explained why it's bad news not just for Trump, but for "virtually everybody at the highest levels of the administration."</p>

      <p>"I think we can all take our impeachment balls and go home now, because that is the whole ball game," said <i>Full Frontal</i>'s Samantha Bee. "The Democrats have been going about this all wrong." Their previous passel of "cautious, sober" witnesses "laid out a damning case, but they didn't exactly give good soundbites," she said. It's now obvious that "in order to catch a selfish, idiotic hotel business guy you have to send a selfish, idiotic hotel business guy," and "if you're not Devin Nunes, it was honestly really fun to watch Gordon Sondland."
