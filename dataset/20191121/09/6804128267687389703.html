      <h1>Lamela, Vertonghen, Ndombele - Latest Tottenham injury news and expected return dates</h1>
      <h2>Who is out and who is a doubt for the London derby against the Hammers?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Warlow, Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>It's all change at Spurs with Jose Mourinho taking over from Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Spurs fans would have been hoping that the international break would allow the team to come back refreshed and hit the ground running, but a massive upheaval has taken place at Hotspur Way.</p>
      <p>Currently, Tottenham fans won't enjoy looking at the table after the first 12 games of the season. Five draws, four losses and just three wins means that the team sit in 14th place in the league, just six points ahead of the relegation places and 11 points behind fourth placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>That run was enough to end Pochettino's time as manager, and Mourinho will be hoping his new team can begin a new run of positive form under his leadership.</p>
      <p>That starts with a short trip to the London Stadium, and Spurs have had some bad luck with injuries so far this season.</p>
      <p>One thing that will help Mourinho is players returning to full fitness.</p>
      <p>But what's the latest Tottenham injury news ahead of the game? Take a look.</p>
      <h3>Hugo Lloris</h3>
      <p>The Tottenham captain is currently sidelined with an elbow injury and is not expected back until the new year.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman sustained a dislocated elbow in the 3-0 defeat against Brighton at the Amex Stadium, with Lloris landing awkwardly on his left arm and was in agony inside his own goal.</p>
      <p>He was given oxygen on the pitch, before being stretchered off and taken to hospital. Spurs have since revealed that the club captain has undergone surgery on his injured left elbow.</p>

      <p>The player himself has now given an update on his condition and possible return to action.</p>
      <p>"Everything is well. There can always be hazards, but my goal is to be ready for January," he told French media outlet <a href="https://www.groupem6.fr/">M6</a>.</p>
      <p>"Whether it's the beginning, the middle or the end, I don't know. In any case, I'll take time to make sure I'm well healed and that I can come back in top form."</p>

      </p>
      <p>The goalkeeper has also made a frank admission to French newspaper <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Hugo-lloris-tottenham-au-sujet-de-sa-blessure-sur-le-moment-la-douleur-est-insupportable/1081117?hootPostID=bcb252b8d2107c8d43f665f89b6ec335">L'Equipe</a>.</p>
      <p>"At the moment, yes, the pain is unbearable. I have never experienced such pain but no I am not worried about my career," he said.</p>
      <h3>Erik Lamela</h3>
      <p>The Argentine has not featured for Spurs since the 5-0 win against Red Star Belgrade last month.</p>
      <p>Lamela had impressed with two assists and a goal as Spurs got back to winning ways in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>However, a thigh injury picked up in training at Hotspur Way caused him to miss the 2-1 loss to Liverpool at Anfield.</p>

      <p>The midfielder then missed the 1-1 draw with Everton and was also left out of the squad for the Champions League win over Red Star Belgrade, while he was not deemed fit enough to make the squad vs Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>He missed both games for Argentina in the international break, and remains a doubt for the game against West Ham.</p>
      <h3>Jan Vertonghen</h3>
      <p>The Belgian has also not featured for Spurs since the 5-0 win against Red Star Belgrade.</p>
      <p>The defender had an hamstring problem, meaning that Toby Alderweireld and Davinson Sanchez retained their places in the centre of defence for the trip to Liverpool, while Eric Dier was preferred against Red Star.</p>
      <p>Vertonghen was another player who was not fit enough to be named in the squad for the game against the Blades, owing to the hamstring strain.</p>

      <p>The centre-back was left out of the Belgium squad for their European qualifiers against Russia and Cyprus, meaning he will have time to try and recover from the injury, but he remains a doubt to face West Ham.</p>

      <h3>Tanguy Ndombele</h3>
      <p>The French midfielder started against Sheffield United, but was taken off at half time with a groin problem.</p>
      <p>After the match, Pochettino gave an an update on the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>"We need to assess him now. I don't know anything at this moment. He felt pain in his groin but I don't know if that was before or during the game it happened," he said.</p>

      <p>"Yes, a strange situation because my feeling was that he wasn't comfortable on the pitch but he said was ok during the game. Then in the end we arrived at half-time and the doctor said to me that we needed to change because he can't continue in the game."</p>
      <p>However, the injury is not thought to be too serious and Ndombele himself has <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/players/tanguy-ndombele-injury-latest-spurs-17247002">provided an update on his fitness</a>.</p>
      <p>"I had tests that said there was nothing serious, it was more fatigue," <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Tanguy-ndombele-equipe-de-france-je-suis-apte-pour-dimanche-contre-l-albanie/1079585">he said</a>. "What is certain is that I am fit for Sunday. Thursday may be a little early, I don't think I'll be 100%."</p>
      <p>He was an unused substitute as France beat Moldova 2-1, and was also left on the bench for the nation's 2-0 victory over Albania on Sunday so he should return to Spurs available to play.</p>
