        <b>Parliament unanimously approved on Wednesday to summon the Minister of Health to clarify data contained in the Annual Report on Access to Health Care in National Health Service Establishments (NHS) in 2018.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The date for the hearing has not yet been set.</p>
      <p>The Social Democrats (PSD) consider the Report of "extreme relevance insofar as it presents information on the structure of care provision and the performance of NHS institutions in terms of access to health care".</p>
      <p>For the PSD, the Report contains "some worrying data that reveal a growing degradation of access to health care in the NHS, namely between 2017 and 2018".</p>
      <p>Examples are the increase in the percentage of hospital consultations performed outside the maximum guaranteed response times to 29 percent, the growth in the number of NHS patients on waiting lists for surgery to more than 244,000 and the increase in average waiting times to undergo surgery to 3.3 months.</p>
