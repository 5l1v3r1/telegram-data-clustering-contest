      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:17:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:17</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Gillespie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-gillespie/</a></address>
      <p>A group from the Stewartry will be helping to spread some festive cheer this weekend.</p>
      <p>Helen Gordon and pals Joy Elliott, Virginia Rennie and Lynne Ferguson are heading to Glasgow for “Mission Christmas”.</p>
      <p>They’ll be cooking a meal for less fortunate people as well as giving out food to old folk and toys to kids.</p>
      <p>It’s the second year in a row they’ve organised the day, which is in tribute to Helen’s son George who passed away on November 30 last year.</p>
      <p>She said: “We’re going to feed 200 people on the street and in the shelter and we’re also going to be making up hampers for old age pensioners, which we didn’t do last year.</p>
      <p>“My granddaughter Kyla Diamond, who is 10, has been buying toys throughout the year that we’ll be handing out.”</p>
      <p>Helen works at Springholm Primary and on Tuesday the pupils handed over lots of donations for Mission Christmas.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Helen added: “The whole community has been fantastic and has really mucked in.</p>
      <p>“A huge thank you to the kids at Springholm Primary and Miss Dooley and also to Tesco in Castle Douglas who have been absolutely amazing, they’ve donated a lot of tins.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">"ACAD also donated £150 worth of food, which is fantastic.”</a>
