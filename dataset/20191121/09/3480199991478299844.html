      <p>The 38-year-old made a stunning reflex save to keep out Bradford’s Hope Akpan in the first half of Tuesday night’s tight FA Cup first-round replay success.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman has made four appearances between the sticks in place of Bristol City loan keeper Max O’Leary, who returned from his ankle injury for a place on the bench at Valley Parade.</p>
      <p>Town boss Ricketts praised Murphy, who saved a penalty from Peterborough on his league debut at the start of this month, for proving he has what it takes.</p>
      <p>“He kept us in the game with a save, which is what he’s paid to do, but it’s still a very good save,” Ricketts said.</p>
      <p>“He was League Two goalkeeper of the season last year for that very reason.</p>
      <p>“The save and the follow-up block by one of the defenders straight afterwards typifies the spirit and the will to win in the group.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes that gets you over the line in games, that real desire to put the block in and make that save or extra tackle.</p>
      <p>“He’s been excellent, he’s been everything I’d hoped he’d be. He’s come in and had a number of games and I think he’s done very, very well.”</p>
      <p>Former Tranmere, Scunthorpe and Coventry goalkeeper Murphy was voted the best shot-stopper in League Two by his fellow players while at champions Bury last season.</p>
      <p>He played every minute for the Shakers before leaving to follow goalkeeping coach Brian Jensen to Town.</p>
      <p>He has played a role in helping Shrewsbury concede just four goals in their last 10 games and a record of 10 clean sheets in 22 games this season.</p>
      <p>Ricketts added on his resolute backline who performed so commandingly again at Valley Parade: “They’re good players with good attributes. They’re all big, they’re all quick, mobile and happy to defend wide and crosses into the box.</p>
      <p>“We have a good set-up, a good base, that starts from the top as well. The least amount of defending they do the better.</p>
      <p>“But when they are tasked with defending crosses or wide they do it very well.”</p>
