      <p>Emirates Airlines has finally responded to claims that the 2019 Di Asa winner Precious Mensah was kicked off the Dubai Flight due to her weight.</p>
      <p>In an official statement released by the airline, Precious Mensah should have purchased two seats for her comfortability and the safety of other passengers.</p>
      <p>According to the management of the airline, the size of the Di Asa winner was too small for a single seat and was supposed to purchase an extra seat.</p>
      <p><i>“An industry practise for passengers who cannot be accommodated in a single seat due to their size is for them to purchase an extra seat for their own safety and comfort, should a seat be available”,</i> an excerpt from the press release read.</p>

Emirates places the highest standards on in-flight safety and as part of this, it is a requirement that all passengers are safely and comfortably seated with their seatbelt fastened. An industry practise for passengers who cannot be accommodated in a single seat due to their size is for them to purchase an extra seat for their own safety and comfort, should a seat be available.”</i>
