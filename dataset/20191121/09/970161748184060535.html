      <p>If you ever wondered whether you need to pick up a pair of sunglasses from Rihanna’s Fenty range, may we direct you to her style of advertising?</p>
      <p>The mogul with the mostess took to the waters of her pool, wearing a string bikini and cover-up to show off her specs overnight and we have to say it’s a real big mood.</p>
      <p>A huge mood, even.</p>
      <p>Her curly hair was all cascade-y down her back as she swanned around the shallows in the series of snapshots.</p>
      <p>In another photo, the Fenty Beauty founder was looking a little drier as she snapped a selfie of herself in the sunnies, before showing us just how much range her photography skills had.</p>
      <p>Evidently loving the colour green, she was all about the flat lay as her specs chilled among her luggage, captioning the shot: ‘#trouble on FENTY.com’</p>

        <figcaption>Ever wanted to know what was in Rihanna’s suitcase? (Picture: @badgalriri)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Yes, her suitcase is clear. God she’s cool.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Still, it’s been quite the whirlwind of a year for the singer/actor/activist/designer/all-round-superstar and the Work singer recently opened up about her struggles in balancing her various businesses, her friendships and three-year relationship with boyfriend Hassan Jameel.</p>
      <p>Proving to be human like the rest of us, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/rihanna-shares-struggle-amid-overwhelming-year-apologises-family-friends-please-forgive-11089245/">Rihanna admitted she’s found it difficult finding time for everything.</a></p>
      <p>And we can totally relate – we need more than seven days in a week to fit in friends, family, work, social commitments, love, feeding the cats and dogs…and we’re not Rihanna.</p>
      <p>In a heartfelt Instagram post – along with a fierce selfie, FYI – RiRi explained: ‘To all my friends/family/coworkers who I have yet to get back to in the past months…please forgive me.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘This year has been quite an overwhelming one, and I’m working on that ish called Balance. Brb. [sic].’</p>
      <p>In the past 11 months alone, the Kiss It Better singer has continued to drop Fenty Beauty lipsticks, pallettes and shimmer powders left, right and centre, while also launching her luxury Fenty clothing line.</p>
      <p>Oh, and of course she’s been slaying her Savage x Fenty lingerie collections too. Plus in September, she hosted her first ever Savage x Fenty fashion show which opened with her performing and featured appearances from a diverse range of supermodels and celebrities.</p>

      <p>So the lady can be forgiven in making us wait a touch longer for fresh tunes, as well as missing a brunch date here and there.</p>
      <p>You keep slaying, queen.</p>
