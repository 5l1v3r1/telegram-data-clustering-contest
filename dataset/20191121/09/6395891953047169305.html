      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - Berlin police say they deployed a tactical response unit to a refugee shelter after spotting a man with an automatic rifle - only to find it was a replica.</p>
      <p>Police spokeswoman Patricia Braemer said Thursday that an off-duty officer walking past the building saw the man through a window posing for photos with the "dangerous looking" weapon and alerted colleagues.</p>
      <p>About 30 officers, including a specialist firearms team, stormed the man's room Wednesday and discovered two men with an airsoft rifle and appropriate ammunition.</p>
      <p>Braemer said the rifle was "almost impossible to discern" from a real firearm and lacked a marking required by law. The men, 27 and 29, are being investigated on suspicion of breaking firearms laws.</p>
      <p>It is illegal in Germany to display replica firearms in public view.</p>
