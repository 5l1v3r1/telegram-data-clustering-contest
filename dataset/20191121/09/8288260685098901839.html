      <h1>'Picked up a knock' - Newcastle United offer injury update ahead of Aston Villa clash</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa meet Newcastle United under the Villa Park lights on Monday night looking to return to winning ways</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:44:13+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:44</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce has provided a mixed injury update for his side's trip to Villa Park on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Bruce makes his first return to B6 since the infamous 'Cabbage-gate' incident in his final game as <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> boss.</p>

      <p>And he will be boosted by the return of defenders Florian Lejeune and Fabian Schar who are both available for selection and could be in line to start the game. But in more negative news for the Magpies, former Villan Ciaran Clark is a major doubt, whilst Jamaal Lascelles and Matt Ritchie will also miss the game.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Speaking to our sister title <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-bruce-press-conference-live-17289831">The Chronicle,</a> Bruce revealed: "Florian Lejeune and Fabian Schar are available to play vs Aston Villa but Ciaran Clark picked up a knock on international duty with Ireland. Jamaal Lascelles has fracture of tibia but his knee ligaments are OK. Matt Ritchie is still out and went to see a specialist yesterday."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Villa will be hoping that their own injury concerns have eased after a number of issues derailed their plans against Wolves last time out.</p>
      <p>Jack Grealish is believed to be in contention for Monday night, whilst Matt Targett and Jota are both hoping to be available.</p>
