        <b>The discovery of gases released from deep beneath the earth’s crust could help to explain Southern Africa’s unusual landscape, a study suggests.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scientists have long puzzled over why areas such as South Africa’s Highveld region are so elevated and flat, with unexpectedly hot rocks below the surface.</p>
      <p>Hotspots are known to generate volcanic activity in Hawaii, Iceland and Yellowstone National Park.</p>

      <p>Geologists have revealed that carbon dioxide-rich gases bubbling up through natural springs in South Africa originate from a column of hot, treacle-like material – called a hotspot – located deep inside the earth.</p>
      <p>In South Africa, the hotspot pushes the crust upwards, generating the distinctive landscape, which consists mostly of tablelands more than one kilometre above sea level, the researchers say.</p>
      <p>This also explains why rocks beneath the region are hotter than expected – a property that could be harnessed to generate geothermal energy.</p>
      <p>A team led by scientists from the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/"><b>University of Edinburgh</b></a> analysed the chemical make-up of gas emerging from a deep crack in the earth’s crust located in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.</p>
      <p>They found that variants of helium and neon present in the gas match the composition of a rocky layer 1,000 km below earth’s surface – called the deep mantle.</p>
      <p>The findings provide the first physical evidence that Southern Africa lies on top of a plume of the abnormally hot mantle, which had until now only been theorised using computer modelling of seismic data.</p>
      <p>The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council.</p>

      <p>The research was completed with support from Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage and the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre.</p>
      <p>It also involved scientists from the Universities of Aberdeen and Strathclyde, Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, <b><a href="https://www.bgs.ac.uk/">British Geological Survey</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.geoscience.org.za/">South Africa Council for Geoscience</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Dr <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuart-gilfillan-b0764228/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3BHDpfLn2oSUqT1D6phqXPiQ%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result&amp;lici=FthHk1GgR7iuOJKwis%2B5gg%3D%3D">Stuart Gilfillan</a></b>, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of GeoSciences, who led the study, said: “The high relief and hotter than expected subsurface temperatures of the rocks beneath Southern Africa had been a puzzle for geologists for many years.</p>
      <p>“Our findings confirm that carbon dioxide gas at the surface is from a deep mantle plume, helping to explain the regions unusual landscape.”</p>
