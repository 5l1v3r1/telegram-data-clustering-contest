      <p>A video has gone viral on social media which shows the pitfalls of applying too much make-up without the aid of feedback.</p>
      <p>In the video, the woman’s makeup is drastically different from her skin one and seems to have been gratuitously applied, perhaps without the aid of a mirror.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, for the lady in question, she does not seem to appreciate how bad her makeup is and how horrible she looks.</p>
