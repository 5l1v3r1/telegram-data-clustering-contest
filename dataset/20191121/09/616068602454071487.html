      <p>Construction has began for a new transit exchange at the Village Green Shopping Centre.</p>
      <p>This new exchange will have a Bus Only entrance leading to four new bus stops, with two shared bus shelters which will be near the entrance to the food court. The bus stops were moved to 48th Avenue in 2016 due to rising safety concerns.</p>
      <p>"Historically, the transit exchange at Village Green Shopping Centre was one of the busiest bus stops in Vernon," said Mayor Victor Cumming. "We have heard many requests for this service to return, increasing accessibility to these local businesses and providing an excellent transit exchange. Therefore, the City is pleased to financially support this project so transit and the exchange can be available at the Centre for many years to come."</p>
      <p>B.C. Transit will re-open the service in Village Green on Dec 22. As part of the project, there will be a new driveway installed from 48th Avenue and the City will move the bus stop signs and replace the bus schedules and information panels.</p>
