      <h1>Nottingham Forest boss Sabri Lamouchi spotted at French top flight match</h1>
      <h2>Lamouchi pictured in the stands at the Ligue 1 clash between Marseille and Lyon at the Stade Velodrome</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> manager Sabri Lamouchi was spotted at a French top flight match during the international break.</p>
      <p>While many of his players were jetting off for a short break, after the Reds beat arch-rivals Derby County 1-0 in the Championship, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Lamouchi</a> was pictured in the stands at the Ligue 1 clash between Marseille and Lyon at the Stade Velodrome.</p>
      <p>It is unclear if Lamouchi was there for pleasure or on a scouting mission ahead of the January transfer window, when he will attempt to bolster the Forest squad in their bid for promotion to the Premier League, having guided them to fifth place in the table after 15 matches.</p>
      <p>Andre Villas-Boas' Marseille won the match 2-1 thanks to a double from former West Ham midfielder Dimitri Payet, with ex-Celtic striker Moussa Dembele on target for Lyon.</p>
