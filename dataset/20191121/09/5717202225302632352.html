      <h1>Jordan Veretout discusses what he learned at Aston Villa</h1>
      <h2>The Frenchman has gone on to become a Serie A star.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:15:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Former Aston Villa midfielder Jordan Veretout has briefly spoken of his time at the club <a href="https://www.francefootball.fr/">during an interview with France Football this week. </a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.siamolaroma.it/2019/11/20/veretout-la-mia-priorita-era-trasferirmi-in-una-grande-squadra-italiana/">As relayed by Siamo La Roma</a>, the Frenchman spoke of how he worked on his physicality at Bodymoor Heath, but did not have much else to say about his time at Aston Villa. </p>
      <p>That is hardly surprising, as it was not a happy experience in England for the former Nantes man. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“In the experience at Nantes, I learned to manage and pass the ball and to play in small spaces. At Aston Villa, I worked on physical and intensity. In Italy there is obviously more tactics and more attention to the defensive phase.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The French midfielder arrived at Villa in a deal said to be worth around £8 million by <a href="https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2016/09/09/jordan-veretout-explains-he-left-aston-villa-as-he-feared-anothe/%20http:/www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3181395/Aston-Villa-unveil-8m-Jordan-Veretout-Nantes-midfielder-signs-five-year-contract.html">the Daily Mail</a> in the summer of 2015. He turned down Leicester City to make the move, <a href="https://www.dreamteamfc.com/c/news-gossip/259784/aston-villa-leicester-jordan-veretout/">as reported by The Sun,</a> with The Foxes going on to win the Premier League title, compounding Veretout’s misery.</p>

      <p>But along with a number of new recruits he struggled at Aston Villa.  Tim Sherwood failed to get the best out of his players and Aston Villa were relegated that season. Veretout headed out on loan to Saint-Etienne before joining Fiorentina permanently in 2017.</p>
      <p>He has since gone from strength to strength and joined Roma on an initial loan deal, with an obligation to buy for €19 million (£16.4m), <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-om/news/roma-sign-19m-veretout-from-fiorentina-on-initial-loan-deal/jwqg1699lfgc14h9qhhw1ge48">according to Goal. </a></p>
      <p>He arrived as a potential replacement for Daniele De Rossi, the Giallorossi legend, and alluded to that point in his<a href="https://www.francefootball.fr/"> France Football</a> interview. </p>
      <p>Aston Villa fans will certainly be bemused at how well the Frenchman’s career has panned out since leaving Villa Park. Along with another from that season, Idrissa Gana Gueye, he has made his way to one of Europe’s biggest clubs and shows no signs of slowing down. </p>
      <p>It just highlights how disastrous that season truly was for Aston Villa.</p>
