      <p>BEIRUT, LEBANON (1:10 P.M.) – The Russian military nearly came to blows with a U.S. aircraft that was flying near the Hmeimim (var. Khmeimim) Airbase along the Syrian coast, the Chinese-language Sina News publication reported.</p>
      <p>Citing the Sina report, the Russian publication <a href="http://avia.pro/news/smi-rossiya-edva-ne-sbila-amerikanskiy-bombardirovshchik-u-granic-sirii">Avia.Pro</a> said, “the mysterious incident occurred near the borders of Syria,” pointing out that “the American strategic B-52H bomber came extremely close to the Russian military base, as a result of which the crew received a warning from the Russian military that they were ready to open fire.”</p>
      <p>Avia.Pro said the Russian military also warned a U.S. F-16 fighter jet that was escorting the B-52H bomber in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p>“It is reported that the Russian army’s ground radar deployed at the Khmeimim base detected a B-52H bomber approaching, and then the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system activated the fire control radar and captured the B-52H bomber with readiness to open fire,” the Sina report said.</p>
