      <h1>The truth is somewhere between fiction and non-fiction: Gurvinder Singh</h1>
      <h2>As the festival circuit gets a taste of 'Khanaur', the filmmaker tells us how films are much more than just products for consumption</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:22:58+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Anuj-Kumar-2042/" target="_blank">Anuj Kumar</a></address>
      <p>Watching Gurvinder Singh’s films is like listening to a recital of a seasoned classical musician where words don’t matter, the melody does. They are like a river in plains, not doing much on the surface, but making the soil fertile along its course. A master of working with natural soundscapes, the National Award-winning director seems to know silent and listen carry the same letters. Like his mentor Mani Kaul, his subjects make you grapple with your conscience, his craft asks you to leave the Bollywood spoon-feeding behind.</p>
      <p>If “Anhey Ghorey Da Daan” (Alms for the Blind Horse) poignantly captures the othering of Dalit Sikhs in Punjab, “Chauthi Koot” (Fourth Direction) revisits the Punjab of 1984 and delves into the growing atmosphere of suspicion between Sikhs and Hindus, where a Gaddi dog becomes a metaphor for silencing <i>the truth</i>.</p>

      <p>Now, Gurvinder has painted “Khanaur” which looks at the aspirations, fears, and insecurities of youth in the hills through its protagonist, Kishan who works in a café in Bir, Himachal Pradesh. Witnessing the fast-changing life around him, he has to make a choice between leading a predictable life around his remote Himalayan village or migrate to the city.</p>
      <p>Made in Pahari, Hindi and English, “Khanaur”, screened at the Busan International Film Festival, Mumbai Academy of Moving Image (MAMI) Festival and the recent Dharamshala International Film Festival<b>, </b>is a personal film for the filmmaker unlike his earlier two films, which were based on works of Punjabi literature and is inspired by his stay in Bir where he ran a café. In fact, Kishan, the protagonist, worked in the café. Gurvinder has worked with a mix of actors and non-actors in the past, but with “Khanaur” he has gone ahead and cast all non-actors. Be it the aging author Monisha Mukundan who runs the café or the village women who celebrate childbirth over a glass of local brew, the strong women in the film easily catch one’s attention.</p>
      <p>“Monisha plays the owner of the café, which was mine. The café was earlier managed by Mani Kaul’s sister Gattoo who passed away two years ago. If alive, she would have played herself in the film. But Monisha was a frequent visitor to the café and had settled down in Bir, so she became the choice for me to replace Gattoo in the film,” relates Gurvinder.</p>
      <p>Talking about the intriguing title, Gurvinder says, “Khanaur” is the vernacular word for a Himalayan variety of bitter chestnut, which the villagers believe is cursed, but made edible by washing regularly for seven straight days. It stands as a metaphor for the beauty of the region and its people and their immediate contact with the environment, yet the immense hardships of such a life.<i> </i>At one point in the film, Kishan compares his fate with Khanaur.</p>

      <p>Edited excerpts:</p>
      <p>
        <b>What was the catalyst for “Khanaur”? How did you ‘discover’ the subject of migration in the hills?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The catalyst was primarily to make a film in the area I was living in. And the comings and goings were an essential part of that experience. The hill boys, no longer satisfied with mere sustenance, hence not interested in traditional livelihoods like farming, animal rearing, and weaving, and neither interested in higher education, want to earn quick money by moving to remote places like Goa to work in tourism (industry). But knowing what such a move means, they don’t want to give up on the strong sense of community living in the hills.</p>
      <p>Literally, everyone is looking for a life outside the traditional livelihoods, with many old people ruing the fact. And at the same time, outsiders like me, seduced by the idea of living close to nature, leaving the hustle of a city, are settling there. We go with the idea of living an ecologically sustainable life, which the locals themselves see no value in now. So outsiders come and build mud houses, while locals have moved onto the cement ones. So all these contradictions became part of the filming process.</p>
      <p>The film is set between Bir and Barot and its remote village Baragraan, from where, the protagonist of the film, Kishan hails. It covers valley and rivers and snow-clad peaks. The process of shooting itself took a year as different scenes were visualised in different seasons and had to include the seasonal activities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Your films invariably become experiences where the viewer loses track of the events and plot points after some resistance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The film does not have much plot points, it’s more experiential than even the first two films which had a clear storyline. What you say is true that I aim for the viewer to get lost in the experiences and to reflect upon those, rather than to directly arouse emotions in them. So there is definitely a demand on the audience who cannot respond the same way to the art form as they do to life in general. That is because the form does not try to imitate life, it creates a kind of resistance or alienation because of the way it is emphatically present. You could call it ‘reflective art’ as opposed to an impact creating ‘visceral art’. A musical, in a way, if you could say. Something which can be experienced many times over, as good music allows for.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You are working with non-actors and have moved away from adapting fiction...</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is a complete reversal of the process of casting in this film. The film was written keeping in mind the people whom I already knew and wanted them to play themselves in the film. So in that sense, it is almost like a constructed documentary that is partly staged and partly unstaged. The idea was to create more possibilities in the staging for the unstaged, for staging to come out of the pretension that it is in most films. The truth, I have always felt, is somewhere between fiction and non-fiction, and here I push myself further in that search. But I don’t know if I can stretch it further! I am making my next film completely with professional actors, staging and plot-line.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is this urge to keep cinema dense, little obtuse? Do you want to take to the level of higher arts such as classical music?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Life itself is dense and obtuse, so why should cinema or any art for that matter, be anything else? I am scared of films where everything is clear and precise and easily definable. I just can’t engage with them and find them completely divorced from any understanding of life, just products for consumption. Best films are the ones in which I can get lost in my thoughts. Like music, and you can watch them a few times, and every time the experience can vary.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You are among the first ones to portray the marginalised and the pained among Punjabis, a community that is always happy in the popular culture.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Sikhs have been depicted as a monolithic community in popular media and films, with no understanding of the deep-rooted fissures within. I became aware of this while travelling through Punjab, documenting its oral ballads, after graduating from the film institute. The caste structure, the social inequality, the marginalisation of the lower castes that one only associated with Hinduism was laid bare.</p>
      <p>Even if you look at the Punjabi film industry, it only constitutes of the Jatts, hence all films are centred around their identity and hegemony over the social and political discourse. You will not see any Punjabi film with a non Jatt as a protagonist. And Hindus who constitute almost 40 percent of Punjab’s population are never represented in these films. In fact, there is no portrayal whatsoever of any other caste or religion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>One has learnt that you are writing a film on undivided Punjab...</b>
      </p>
      <p>The film I want to make is set in West Punjab, which is in Pakistan. It is not about undivided Punjab, in fact, it is about the present divided Punjab, which is the reality. It is written by a friend, Ali Akbar Natiq, who is a very unique young voice in Urdu literature, with sensibilities rooted in his part of Punjab. And that makes it necessary for me to shoot it in Punjab across the border, which I know is not an easy possibility. But I am willing to wait for it to happen and hope so it will.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How are your relations with the FTII, your alma mater, after a student project helmed by you was stalled by the authorities? Are you concerned about creative freedom at the prestigious institute?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have said before also that I never wish to be associated with FTII in any capacity ever in the future. To be involved there means having to toe their line in how one deals with the students. As for creative freedom, I am sure the students will be able to guard it, whatever the dispensation. It’s a struggle, both as a student and even afterwards, and one needs to learn to navigate it. Artists are anyway more intelligent than administrators!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Between the lines</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>On screening at the Dharamashala and Busan film festivals</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sadly, the people who acted in the film could not turn up at the Dharamshala festival. Kishan’s grandmother died just a few days before the screening. A strange case of art foretelling the future. But the response was tremendous, specially from the people who have settled there from outside, both Indians and foreigners. The foreigners felt it gave them a perspective on the locals which was missing due to the language barrier with them. As for Busan, the film got a very encouraging response from both cinephiles and common viewers. A teenage boy even said the film totally represented the crossroads at where many young men like him from outside the big cities stood in Korea. A woman remarked at the vertical arrangement of most shots in the film, as opposed to the trend to make everything horizontal. As always, some people connect with cinema from a sociological perspective, others more from its artistic perspective.</p>
      <p>
        <b>On the future of independent films in the age of OTT platforms</b>
      </p>
      <p>Going by the recent independent films coming out of India, it is clear that the producers are getting encouraged by the possibility of finding an outlet for the films on the OTT platforms, besides the space offered by film festivals. At least there is a life for a film after its festival run. For example, “Anhey Ghorhey Da Daan” itself has been since its release on Netflix, Amazon, Hotstar and now MUBI. To have the film available in public space for the coming years other than its DVD release was unimaginable earlier. So producers see a long term relevance in supporting films which has an audience on these platforms. Besides, the interest in this kind of cinema is really growing amongst the young population. I have always felt that more than directors, we need producers who are willing to stand by our kind of cinema. We can no longer depend only on State funding, which has almost disappeared.</p>
