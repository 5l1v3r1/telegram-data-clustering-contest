      <p>To promote the best initiatives and practices to protect road users, Qatar Transportation and Traffic Safety Center (QTTSC) has partnered with Abdullah Abdulghani &amp; Bros Co (AAB) - Toyota, to launch National Road Safety Award.</p>
      <p>QTTSC at Qatar University College of Engineering (QU-CENG) signed an agreement yesterday with Abdullah Abdulghani &amp; Bros Co (AAB)  to establish a collaboration on the sponsorship of the first National Road Safety Award Program for the State of Qatar. </p>
      <p> The agreement was signed by CENG Dean Dr Khalid Kamal Naji and AAB Acting CEO Murugan R K in the presence of QTTSC Director Professor Faris Tarlochan. Secretary of the National Traffic Safety Committee (NTSC), Brigadier Mohammed Abdullah Al Malki in a ceremony held yesterday at Qatar University. The ceremony was also attended Director-General of the General Directorate of Traffic (GDT), Major General Mohammed Saad Al Kharji, together with representatives from GDT, CENG and AAB.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the agreement, Dr Khalid Kamal Naji said: “Road safety is one of the main areas of interest in Qatar. The College of Engineering through the QTTSC continues to highlight its commitment to road safety by investing in research and awareness programs that help find sustainable solutions to the road and traffic challenges in Qatar. This agreement demonstrates CENG’s continuous efforts to contribute to road safety in Qatar by reducing road traffic accidents and developing a safe road transport system in line with the National Road Safety Strategy 2013-2022.”</p>
      <p>He added that every year, more than one million people die on the roads worldwide and another 50 million suffer various injuries that could lead to disabilities as well as material losses that significantly affect the state budget. </p>
      <p>“Since the UN announced that 2011-2020 will be the ‘Decade of Action for Road Safety,’ many countries, including Qatar, have devoted their efforts in developing the road safety system,” said Naji. </p>
      <p>Murugan said that traffic safety has always been a priority to AAB, which is reflected in the activities and programs it has developed with the Traffic Department for Traffic Safety Week over the past years. “The National Traffic Safety Award is a significant milestone in Qatar to promote the best initiatives and practices to protect road users. We believe that this award will spearhead the road safety ambition and will create a good framework to achieve it,” said Murugan. </p>
