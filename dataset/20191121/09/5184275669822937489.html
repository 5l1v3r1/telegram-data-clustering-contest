      <p>Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani starrer <i>Good Newwz</i> has grabbed amazing reviews for the recently released trailer. While the audience is not even over the trailer yet, Akshay Kumar has dropped some hilarious words of wisdom with a picture of him and Kareena and no husband in this world can agree more to it.</p>
      <p>Akshay shared a picture of him and Kareena from the film. In the picture, both can be seen sitting in a clinic as a nurse can be spotted in the background. Both are looking at each other, while Kareena is flashing her grin, Akshay is confused just like he is on all the posters.</p>

      <p>The film is also a reunion for Akshay and Kareena as the two will be seen together after a very long time.</p>
      <p>The story revolves around two couples Akshay ‚Äì Kareena and Diljit ‚Äì Kiara. It is about them trying to conceive through IVF procedure. The goof-up happens when the sperms get exchanged due to the two couples having the same surnames. The trailer is a laugh riot and the film promises more.</p>
      <p>Directed by Raj Mehta and bankrolled by Karan Johar‚Äôs Dharma Production, <i>Good Newwz</i> is set to hit theatres on December 27 this year.</p>
