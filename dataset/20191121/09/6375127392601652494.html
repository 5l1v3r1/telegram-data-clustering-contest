      <h3>A NEW-BORN girl was abandoned by her mother in a vacant lot in Malaybalay City until she was discovered by a man whose attention was caught by the cries of the infant shortly before noon Wednesday, police said.</h3>
      <p>An investigation showed that Jhun Pescador,41, a resident of Baklayon, Lantapan, Bukidnon was visiting his daughter at the Luna Boarding House in Purok 3 in Malaybalay City around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday when some boarders called his attention regarding the sound of a baby crying at the back of the house.</p>
      <p>Pescador went to the site to investigate until he found the new-born baby wrapped in a piece of black cloth and covered with a ‘gabi’ or taro root leaf.</p>
      <p>The baby was immediately taken to the Bethel Baptist Hospital where she was reported to be in fine condition.</p>
      <p>The Malaybalay City Police Station in coordination with the City Social Welfare and Development Office are still trying to identify the mother of the infant. Once identified, the woman will be taken in for questioning and filing of appropriate criminal charges for abandoning her baby, said Police Regional Office 10 director, Brigadier General Rolando B. Anduyan.</p>
