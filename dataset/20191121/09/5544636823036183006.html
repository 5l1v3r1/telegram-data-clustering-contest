      <p>A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Jackson Ojo has claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor would come from the north.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that Buhari from North-West Katsina State is expected to handover to someone from southern Nigeria in 2023 under the country’s unwritten power rotation policy.</p>
      <p>Ojo who spoke recently in Abuja, has, however, claimed that such an arrangement would not work in 2023.</p>
      <p>He, therefore, urged the south to forget about getting the presidency in the coming general election, saying there are no top politicians in the south.</p>
      <p>The APC chieftain was quoted by Vanguard as asking: “who is there in the South that has the national clout?</p>
      <p>“There are some people in the South-West that are making noise today, wanting to be President.</p>
      <p>“The truth is that they cannot be President. That is it! Mark my word! APC Presidential candidate in 2023 will emerge from the north.</p>
      <p>“The South-West will be given the Vice Presidential slot. And if the PDP takes its candidate from the South, then they have given the opportunity to the APC to win again. The south does not have the political capacity to fight the North.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The people of the South are agitating to be President of Nigeria in 2023. Is it by mere verbal expression?</p>
      <p>“The North has 19 states including the FCT. The South has 17. There is no political synergy between the South-East, South-South and South-West.</p>
      <p>“Each of them is standing independently as a pillar that cannot be moved but when you go up north, you will always get the traditional bloc vote because there is a unifying factor among them.</p>
      <p>“Religion can unify them and they have leaders that can unify them. In the north, you have the Northern Governors Forum, the Northern Senators Forum and all that. Do we have these unifiers in the South?</p>
      <p>“South-South is standing on its own, same with South-East and South-West. In the South, there is a multi-dimensional dichotomy, politically that is.</p>
      <p>“Such a dichotomy can never be found in the North. Let us not deceive ourselves. What is the voting capacity of the North?</p>
      <p>“The voting capacity of the South-South and the South-East cannot withstand the voting capacity of Kano, Katsina and Kebbi states.”</p>
