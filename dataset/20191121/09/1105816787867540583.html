      <p>More than 300 people have been killed since the start of mass unrest in Baghdad and southern Iraq in early October, the largest demonstrations since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.</p>
      <p>The protests are an eruption of public anger against a ruling elite seen as enriching itself off the state and serving foreign powers, especially Iran, as many Iraqis languish in poverty without jobs, healthcare or education.</p>
      <p>The unrest has shattered the relative calm that followed the defeat of the militant Islamic State in 2017.</p>
