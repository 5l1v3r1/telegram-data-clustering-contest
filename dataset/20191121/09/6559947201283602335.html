        <li><b>UPDATE:</b> Currys PC World has now launched its early Black Friday campaign, which will most likely run up until Cyber Monday on December 2, with the occasional deal carrying over into these sales as well.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As part of its <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bd8f?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F118377%2F1%2F%3Finline">2019 promotion</a>, the retailer is now encouraging you to buy early, avoiding the Black Friday date altogether. To back this up Currys is promising to refund the difference on any deals that turn out cheaper on Black Friday, on November 29.</p>
      <p>This is available on purchases made between November 13 - 21, but these dates may alter as we approach Black Friday and the end of the month. If you want to take advantage of this offer, you can register your details within 14 days of purchasing and claim any difference back during the assigned dates of December 17 - 31.</p>
      <p>To be kept up to date during this busy shopping period, bookmark our relevant Black Friday pages and make sense of all the madness.</p>
