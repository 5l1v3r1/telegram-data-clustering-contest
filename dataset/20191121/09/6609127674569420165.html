      <p>The car ended up being wedged beneath the lorry, and the driver had to be cut free by firefighters.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old man who was driving the Vauxhall was rushed to Ninewells Hospital, where he is being treated for life-threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>The road was closed until late last night as an investigation was carried out.</p>
      <p>Cops probing the crash are appealing to witnesses to come forward.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Ewan Pearce, from the Glenrothes Road Policing station, said: “We are asking for anyone who witnessed the crash, or was driving through the area around the time, to come forward with any information they have, which could help our enquiries.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with information can contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 2547 of 20 November."</p>
