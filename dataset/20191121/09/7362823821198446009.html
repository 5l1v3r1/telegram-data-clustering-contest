      <p>The student organization told ABC News it was given only given 24 hours’ notice about the event and the campaign said Patrick canceled because he was late from another event and had to catch a flight.</p>
      <p>The campaign added that Patrick would reschedule his Morehouse visit, Haslett reported.</p>
      <p>Patrick filed Nov. 14 to be on the New Hampshire primary ballot in February.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time Patrick has had trouble filling a room. New York Times reporter Jennifer Medina tweeted a photo of a nearly empty room at another event on Monday.</p>
