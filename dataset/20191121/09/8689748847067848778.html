      <p>A social media user by username My Leakz is set to cause an uproar in Ghana if the post made by him/her is anything to go by.</p>
      <p>According to MyLeakz, he/she has a leak video of the two lectures of the University of Ghana who were captured in the famous BBC sex for grades exposé.</p>
      <p>Dr Butakor and Prof. Gyampo who were fingered in the popular BBC exposé have been cleared by the University but if MyLeakz post is anything to go by, then it will indeed confirm the earlier rumours and accusations levelled against them.</p>
      <p>The social media user shared two separate screenshots of people doing the thing with the caption;</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hello Ghana, I have a surprise for you all. Before the surprise can someone please check if Dr. Bu and Prof. Gya are doing well, I don’t want any heat attack. I have a nice video here titled BuGya featuring two most popular Leg lecturers dropping soon…”</b>
