      <h1>Ryan Tubridy 'haunted by children in poverty' as he confirms he will accept RTE pay cut</h1>
      <h2>His wages will have dropped by more than 40% since taking up the Late Late Show gig</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:53:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Gallagher</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Tubridy said yesterday he was haunted by the idea of children in poverty as he revealed he would accept the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rte">RTE</a> pay cut.</p>
      <p>The presenter was launching the St Vincent de Paul <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/christmas">Christmas </a>Appeal when he told how his wages will have dropped by more than 40% since taking up the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/late-late-show">Late Late Show</a> gig.</p>
      <p>And as he spoke of the<a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/homeless-crisis"> homeless crisis</a> that is gripping Ireland, he said he would accept RTE cost-cutting measures gracefully.</p>
      <p>Tubs added: “I’ve taken a pay cut before. I took over 30% the last time and they’ve asked for more again which will bring it up to about 45% or (so) since I took the Late Late Show.</p>
      <p>“When it comes to this sort of issue, that’s not something I’ve ever been found wanting in and that continues to be the case, yeah.”</p>

      <p>In response to RTE’s current financial crisis, director-general Dee Forbes said its top-paid broadcasters would need to take a 15% cut.</p>
      <p>Tubs’ salary fell by 31% from €723,000 to its present level of €495,000 in 2013. A 15% cut on top of that would leave him earning around €420,000 a year.</p>
      <p>But he said he still believed in the importance of the State broadcaster.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old added: “Some of the great programmes and documentaries in news service and entertaining programmes are there and I think they are a very important part of the national identity, the national fabric, the tapestry of who we are. And I would hate that import to be lost in the fog of unhappiness for other reasons.</p>
      <p>"So I believe in RTE and I think that if it was to disappear tomorrow I think it would be a sad day. Imagine there was no RTE after <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/gay-byrne">Gay Byrne</a> died and you depended on a tweet to say well done and sorry to see he is gone."</p>

      <p>“You talk about public service broadcasting and I think the nation wanted to mourn the passing of my friend, our friend, Gay and the way they pulled the programme together and everyone came on the show was a real moment.”</p>
      <p>Working again with SVP for their annual appeal, dad-of-two Tubs said it felt “depressing” to still have to attend such launches.</p>
      <p>He added: “The reason I do this every year [is] because when I was in school we did some work with SVP and you would hope that within 10 or 20 years the problem would be solved, or at least close to, and it just isn’t.</p>
      <p>“And it is really quite shocking that you have 4,000 children living in hubs or hotels and doing their homework on dressing tables meant for dressing not homework and that they have to order food instead of having a decent meal – it’s appalling.</p>
      <p>“I wish I didn’t have to be here. I wish they could just get on with it and didn’t need someone with a bit of a profile to launch it for them. But I will keep coming and for as long as they’ll have me or as long as I feel strongly about it and I do.</p>

      <p>“Because I have been very lucky and I’ve had a lovely childhood and it drives me mad to think that there are children who aren’t having that luck.</p>
      <p>“I spoke to a woman this morning whose daughter died in California on the Berkeley balcony and the interview haunted me because it was just such a terrible story.</p>
      <p>“And a man’s response, who wrote into me on one of the texts, was, ‘I am under the breadline’.</p>
      <p>“He said something like his business is gone, he’s absolutely ruined financially but he said he was listening to that mother and said, ‘At least I have got my daughters, I am OK’.</p>
      <p>“And I just thought, God yeah, but you are still in trouble, that’s not nice and it is not fair, but hopefully he will get in touch and SVP will help him.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, with just a week until the Late Late Toy Show, Tubs said his team were working on a way to pay tribute to Gay Byrne.</p>
      <p>He added: “He will be acknowledged in the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/late-late-toy-show">Toy Show</a>. Of course he will. We are working on how to do it in a way that is fair and fitting.”</p>
      <p>But he insisted the show would be his “goofiest” ever. Tubs said: “ It’s a work in progress. It’s pretty grim.</p>
      <p>"We did the Greatest Showman last year and it was intense and this year we are full goof again, full goof. The goof factor is probably the highest yet.”</p>
