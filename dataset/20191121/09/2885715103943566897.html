      <h1>Pagalpanti box office prediction: John-Anil starrer expected to have a good weekend</h1>
      <h2>Releasing in over 2000 screens, the film starring John Abraham, Anil Kapoor, Arshad Warsi and Pulkit Samrat among others might register a double-digit opening.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:51:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/arushi-jain/" target="_blank">Arushi Jain</a></address>
      <p>Two years after giving a comedy caper in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arjun-kapoor/">Arjun Kapoor</a>-Anil Kapoor starrer Mubarakan, filmmaker Anees Bazmee is all set to tickle the funny bone of moviegoers this Friday with the release of Pagalpanti. The film is backed by an ensemble cast of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/john-abraham/">John Abraham</a>, Anil Kapoor, Arshad Warsi, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/pulkit-samrat">Pulkit Samrat</a>, Ileana D’Cruz, Urvashi Rautela, Kriti Kharbanda, and Saurabh Shukla. Since it is after some time that cinephiles have a nonsensical comedy-drama in the offing, film trade analyst Girish Johar believes Pagalpanti will have a good run at the box office.</p>
      <p>Releasing in over 2000 screens, the film might register a double-digit opening. “Pagalpanti is a quirky family comedy directed by Anees Bazmee. It has an ensemble cast of Anil Kapoor, John Abraham, Pulkit Samrat and Arshad Warsi among others supporting it. All the actors, with their fan following, have the power to pull the audience to the theaters,” suggested Girish.</p>
      <p>He added, “The film looks like a clean commercial comedy. After a long time, a film has come where you can keep your brains out and just enjoy some time with your family. The trailer is also being liked and songs have created awareness among the audience. So, I think Pagalpanti should open at around Rs 9-10 crore. It will probably have a good weekend at the box office.”</p>

      <p>Both Anil Kapoor and John Abraham have been delivering entertaining films. Over the years, John has emerged as a reliable box office star. His films Batla House, Romeo Akbar Walter and Satymeva Jayate are proof of his box office prowess. Kapoor has also been a favourite of the audience. His charisma never fails to impress moviegoers. Now, if their magic will help Pagalpanti sail through the first weekend, remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>Other than Pagalpanti, the audience has Ayushmann Khurrana’s Bala and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sidharth-malhotra/">Sidharth Malhotra</a>-Riteish Deshmukh’s Marjaavaan running in theaters. When asked if both of these will affect Pagalpanti’s business on the first day, Girish replied, “Not really. Bala is done with its successful run and Marjaavaan is working mostly among the mass audience. So, Pagalpanti doesn’t seem to have a competition at the box office.”</p>
