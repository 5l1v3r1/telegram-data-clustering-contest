      <blockquote>All you disrespectful lil shits that have no home training that feel that you can be rude to celebrities because you have the privilege of being on Instagram, una dey mad o! There is a higher grace attached to people who bring joy and happiness in one way or another to others, (especially via music and movies) and some people just decide they can repay such godly acts with rudeness and disrespect, una dey mad o! • Some of you have no idea what it is to walk in our shoes, we are not perfect, we are human, many love us and as thus many pray for us, but there are some of you that curse us, una dey mad o! • We bleed like regular humans, we have bad days like regular humans, we sweat like regular humans, we worked hard to get to where we are and some people just derive joy from pulling us down, una dey mad o! • Agreed, some celebrities misbehave and some deserve to be reminded that they are human, but ffs (for f*ck sake)… he who is without sin, cast the first stone! …no? …noone? …UNA DEY MAD O!</blockquote>
