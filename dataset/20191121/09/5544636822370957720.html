      <p>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has said the clubs he coached including Chelsea, and Real Madrid did not have structures to develop young talents.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/tottenham-appoints-jose-mourinho-as-head-coach/">Mourinho was on Wednesday named as the new coach of Tottenham</a> after the club sacked Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been known for not developing young players and going for already-established stars.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese, has, however, dismissed the notion saying the clubs he coached in the past, unlike Tottenham, do not have strong youth systems.</p>
      <p>“I really like this squad and looking to the young players – there is not one manager in the world that doesn’t like to play young players and to help young players to develop – not one,” Mourinho told Tottenham’s website.</p>

      <p>“The problem is that sometimes you get into clubs where the work that is below you is not good enough to produce these players, so I look to our history and you see that the academy is always giving the talents that the first team need.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I look forward to [working] with that profile. To play against Tottenham at White Hart Lane was always hard but beautiful.</p>

      <p>“It was one of these places where I used to go with passion but also with respect. I always [spoke] about the club’s potential.</p>
      <p>“I always [spoke] about the qualities of the players. I always [spoke about] the magnificent work the club was doing.”</p>
