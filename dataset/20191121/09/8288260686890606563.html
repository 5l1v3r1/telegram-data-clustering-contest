      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:40:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Newbould, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/daniel-newbould/</a></address>
      <p>An appeal against the council’s decision to reject planning permission for five traveller dwellings in Kingsbury has been thrown out.</p>
      <p>The proposal, which North Warwickshire Borough Council turned down in December last year, sought permission for the change of use of land in Tamworth Road, Cliff to equestrian use and use as a gypsy site comprising of five pitches with dayrooms including the relocation of access, a stables block, ménage and installation of treatment plant.</p>
      <p>An appeal was made against the rejection but in a report released this week, seen by the Herald, the Planning Inspectorate also rejected the proposal on green belt grounds.</p>
      <p>The main issues in the case were listed as:</p>
      <p>• Whether the proposal would be inappropriate in green belt</p>
      <p>• The effect of the proposal on the character and appearance of the surrounding area; and</p>
      <p>• If it is inappropriate development, whether the harm by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations, so as to amount to the very special circumstances necessary to justify the development.</p>

      <p>Inspector Elaine Worthington concluded: “The proposal would cause substantial harm to green belt and further harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>"The National Planning Policy Framework is clear that the government attaches great importance to green belts and that their essential characteristics are their openness and permanence. In spatial terms it would introduce a good deal of development into what is an open field.</p>
      <p>“I consider that the proposal as a whole would be appreciated as an unwelcome pocket of urbanising development in the countryside that would fail to protect and detract from the rural character of its surroundings.</p>
      <p>“On the other hand, in the context of the uncertain levels of need for gypsy and traveller sites in the area, alongside the absence of any allocated sites in the borough and the lack of alternative sites for the appellant, the contribution that the proposal would make to the supply of gypsy and traveller sites is a benefit which counts in its favour.</p>
      <p>   </p>
      <p>"However, the currently unknown nature of the likely future need for sites, limits the weight I attach to this benefit.</p>
      <p>“Whilst bearing in mind the need to eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity, in my view the adverse impacts of dismissing the scheme on the appellant and her family are necessary and proportionate.”</p>
      <p>Kingsbury councillor Andy Jenns said: “Local concerns have always been about the harm this development would cause to the remaining green belt between Kingsbury and Dosthill.</p>
      <p>“Previous applications to develop the same site have been refused on green belt grounds and many local people feel that principle should continue to be upheld.”</p>
