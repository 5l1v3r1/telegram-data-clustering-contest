      <h1>60,000+ capacity Anfield on horizon as Liverpool set to announce plans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:30:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool will present their plans for Anfield ‘s latest capacity increase to local residents and businesses at the end of this month.</p>
      <p>Neil Jones of <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-set-to-take-anfield-capacity-past-60000-as-they/1vvvizm0a9ny11fw4wx7ljkxm4">Goal</a> has written today that the club wants Anfield to grow to at least 60,000, due to the enormous current demand for tickets that far outweighs the 54,000 seats we have now.</p>
      <p>Many Liverpool members will agree that the ticketing system right now is a mess and it is very hard to watch home games – even when a loyal fan.</p>
      <p>According to Jones, Liverpool will set up ‘an online hub,’ where fans can respond to the plans – which will be first announced at the Kop Bar in Anfield on Friday November 29 (4pm-8pm).</p>
      <p>Liverpool right now wouldn’t struggle to sell out a 90,000 seater – so the 60,000 should be the least we’re aiming for.</p>
      <p>With extra bodies though comes a need for better transport links. Labour’s West Derby MP Ian Byrne has already discussed plans for a train station by the ground to help this – so perhaps we’ll hear more about this at the first meeting, too.</p>
