      <h1>Millie Bobby Brown Addresses Global Summit At United Nations &amp; I’m Sorry, But How Is She 15</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:04:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:04</time> by <a rel="author">By PEDESTRIAN.TV</a></address>
      <p>UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador <b>Millie Bobby Brown</b> opened up about her experiences with bullying during a rousing speech for World Children’s Day at United Nations headquarters in New York.</p>
      <p>Millie was joined by fellow ambassador <b>David Beckham</b> as the duo demanded equal rights for children across the globe.</p>
      <p>During her speech, Millie addressed the tremendous amount of cyber-bullying and online abuse she’s received over the years, despite being only 15.</p>
      <p>“I was lucky. With the help of my friends, family and people around me, I was able to overcome these negative feelings and take my power back. But millions of children aren’t so lucky. They’re still struggling in the darkness…”</p>

      <p>Millie later took to Instagram to discuss the importance of this UN address. “i was so grateful to have the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of my idol, Audrey Hepburn,” she captioned a snippet of her speech. “she addressed world leaders as they adopted the UN convention on the Rights of the Child.”</p>
      <p>“today was a dream because i joined @unicef to mark the 30th anniversary of the Convention and remind everyone *specifically world leaders* that children’s rights matter. today is #WorldChildrensDay and I am v proud to join young people all across the world to ask world leaders to stand WITH us. listen. and make change. protect us and our beautiful planet! there’s more work to do. much more.”</p>
      <p>We simply can’t help but stan such an inspirational human, who’s ridiculously wise beyond her years. Check out the small portion of her speech below.</p>
