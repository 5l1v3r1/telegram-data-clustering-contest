      <h1>Girl, 11, 'body-slammed' by 225lb Primark security guard after 'stealing socks'</h1>
      <h2>Footage shows Leeajah Williams being pinned down by 36-year-old Mohammad Khan as his colleagues and shoppers plead with him during the seven-minute incident in Boston</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:37:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:37</time> by <a rel="author">Lorraine King</a></address>
      <p>Shocking footage has emerged that shows a 225lb security guard appearing to body-slam a child suspected of stealing socks at a Primark store.</p>
      <p>The clip, which was posted on social media, shows Leeajah Williams being pinned down by 36-year-old Mohammad Khan inside the branch in Boston.</p>
      <p>Khan is seen wrestling Leeajah to the ground after he allegedly caught her lifting a pack of socks and trying to walk out of the budget clothing store.</p>
      <p>A witness screams: "He just punched her in the face" while a man says: "Don't hit her, don't hit her."</p>
      <p>The 11-year-old, who is believed to have admitted theft, was left swollen and bruised following her seven-minute ordeal which took place in June, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10390339/boston-primark-guard-slams-girl-video/">Sun Online</a> reports.</p>

      <p>The footage of the incident has come to light following Khan being charged with assault and battery on a child under 14 this week.</p>
      <p>Khan and his bosses - New Jersey-based Securitas Security Services USA- are also accused of civil right violations.</p>
      <p>Leeajah cannot be charged due to her being under the age of criminal responsibility under state laws, according to the  <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/11/20/pound-security-guard-allegedly-throttled-year-old-store-thief-june-boston-now-guard-facing-charges/cPXJBMMkl7KRtuGZXlNlnO/story.html?event=event12">Boston Globe</a> .</p>
      <p>Her mum Sherrice Williams, who she says admits trying to steal clothing worth $175, shared photos of her with bruises and a swollen lip.</p>

      <p>Sherrice also claims Leeajah has been left so traumatised by the incident on June 9 that she is having counselling.</p>
      <p>The mum told  <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/security-guard-at-primark-in-boston-indicted-for-choking-punching-11-year-old-shoplifter/29861896">WCVB</a>  News: "She stole a pack of socks, was walking out the door and a guy grabbed her and threw her against the wall - the security guard.</p>
      <p>"She was screaming, 'Get off of me!'</p>
      <p>"She didn't know who he was because he wasn't dressed in any type of security clothing, so she thought he was just a random man grabbing her."</p>

      <p>Authorities have claimed that 6ft 1in Khan dragged the schoolgirl into a corner of the store that has no CCTV before punching, choking and leaping on her.</p>
      <p>Khan, who works as a special part-time police officer, is claimed to have ignored pleas from his colleagues and shoppers and has been pulled up by his bosses four times before for using excessive force.</p>
      <p>Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins said: "The Boston Police were exemplary in de-escalating the situation when they arrived, and the other Securitas employees in the store behaved appropriately during the encounter.</p>
      <p>"Being a Special Police Officer allows someone the power of arrest, but with that power comes great responsibility.</p>

      <p>"I applaud the vast majority of Boston Police officers and SPOs who behave professionally and with restraint."</p>
      <p>Khan is due before Suffolk Superior Court on December 17.</p>
