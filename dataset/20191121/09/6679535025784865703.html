      <p>Unlike last year when the toor farmers of the district incurred loss owing to poor rainfall and drought, this year, they are hoping for a better yield because of timely and good rains in the Kharif season.</p>
      <p>The showers in October provided the gave much-needed moisture to the crop, and the fields are looking lush green.</p>
      <p>According to agriculture department officials, toor is sown on 3.27 lakh hectare in the Kharif season. Though farmers were in distress owing to poor rainfall in the beginning of the season, later showers have given them hopes of a good yield.</p>
      <p>Officials said they are expecting around 2.5 to 3 quintal of crop /acre in the district this year. Last year, the average production was around 1 to 1.5 quintal/ acre owing to deficit rains.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Union government declared a minimum support price of ₹5675/quintal for toor, while the State government added ₹425/quintal to make a total MSP of ₹6,100.</p>
      <p>However, the government fixed the maximum purchase of only 10 quintal from each farmer. Last year, the government had procured over 3.45 lakh quintal of toor from over 37,000 farmers. The farmers were happy with the price, but they were upset with cap of 10 quintal.</p>
      <p>This year, the Union government further increased the MSP to ₹5,800/ quintal, and the State government is yet to announce its share, which is expected to be announced after the commencement of harvesting period and before opening of procurement centres in toor-growing areas.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farmers are hoping for a good harvest as they have already suffered in the past owing to hostility of nature.</p>
