      <p>A SCHOOL project in Alkimos is trying to create more habitat for endangered Carnaby’s black cockatoos.</p>
      <p>St James’ Anglican School Year 2 classes, under the guidance of teacher Tim Crane, have started the ‘Carnaby’s Cockatoo Project’ to revegetate vacant land on the west side of their school.</p>
      <p>Once completed, the site will have space for children to read, do class work, connect with nature or have quiet time.</p>
      <p>For teachers it will be an alternative to the indoor classroom with opportunities to learn across the curriculum.</p>

      <p>“As a new and growing school we are always looking at ways to enhance our learning spaces and create a stimulating education environment for our students,” head of junior school Dan Mornement said.</p>
      <p>“This project will allow children to experience nature up close and encourage native fauna into our backyard.”</p>
      <p>As well as being a learning place, the area has been revegetated with plant species that are preferred by the Carnaby’s black cockatoos, which frequent the Alkimos area.</p>

      <p>Recent studies have shown these birds have been avoiding some areas due to a lack of vegetation and rehabilitation efforts.</p>
      <p>In September, students spent a morning planting 400 seedlings on the site to start the project.</p>
      <p>They have since had many hours of weeding, watering, infill planting and maintaining the area, which will be their responsibility as the project grows.</p>
      <p>The school has already started using the area as an outdoor learning space, with Year 2 students comparing the different root structures of grasses and broad leaf plants during their weeding sessions.</p>

      <p>Year 8 students, as part of their science unit, have started taking drone footage of the seedlings to provide monthly photographic growth monitoring.</p>
      <p>Junior school students have spent time at recess and lunch building rock sculptures, creek beds and irrigation systems, while others go for walks around the area.</p>
      <p>A water tank and buckets are permanently left on the site so any classes can pop down in their own time and work together to keep the seedlings hydrated and strong.</p>
