      <h1>Here Are The Winners Of Triple J’s 2019 ‘J Awards’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:53:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:53</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Richards</a></address>
      <p>Each year, triple j dolls out the J Awards at the end of Ausmusic month, celebrating the year’s best and brightest sonic contributions. And the 2019 winners are in, with Matt Corby taking out the top honour of Australian Album of the Year for sophomore album <i>Rainbow Valley</i>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Double J and Unearthed respectively awarded <a href="https://junkee.com/sampa-forum-theatre-review/230513">Sampa The Great</a> and Tones And I as their Artists of the Year. Tones’ win is far from a surprise, given she’s gone from an unknown and unsigned artist to <a href="https://junkee.com/tones-spotify-top-50/225025">a global chart-topper</a> and ARIA-record breaker in less than a year, with ‘Dance Monkey’ holding the #1 spot <a href="https://www.ariacharts.com.au/news/2019/tones-and-i-breaks-singles-chart-record">for an unparalleled 16 weeks</a>.</p>

      <p>As for the Music Video of the Year, Sampa took out another trophy for ‘Final Form’, directed by Sanjay De Silva and filmed while Sampa visited her home country of Zambia — a process incredibly important to <i>The Return</i>, her debut album.</p>
      <p>This year, there were five J Awards thanks to the admission of a new category, the You Done Good Award, dedicated to those who have offered up a lot to the music industry beyond music itself.</p>
      <p>For this, Heidi Lenffer of Cloud Control won for co-establishing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/04/theres-no-reason-why-this-couldnt-go-global-australian-music-industry-invests-in-solar-farms">FEAT (aka Future Energy Artists)</a>, an organisation that lets artists offset the high carbon footprint of touring and creating music by investing in a solar farm. In an interview with <i>Driv</i>e’s Veronica and Lewis after winning the award, Lenffer promised more good things to come, including a whole heap of artists getting involved, as well as interest from organisations outside of the music industry, including the Wallabies.</p>
