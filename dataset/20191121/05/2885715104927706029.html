      <h1>JNU fee hike: Centre sits across the table with students</h1>
      <h2>The high-powered committee was set up by the HRD Ministry late Sunday to “recommend ways to restore normal functioning in JNU”.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:56:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>The central government’s high-powered committee, after its first meeting with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University students Wednesday, has decided to hold the second round of dialogue on campus.</p>
      <p>“We gave them (officers-elect of JNUSU and hostel presidents) a patient hearing. We have asked them to come back to us in two days with what they would have suggested in the meeting of the university hostel committee (on October 28), had they been allowed to participate,” said a panel member. The committee met with 36 elected student representatives on Wednesday morning and 17 hostel presidents in the afternoon at the HRD Ministry.<br/>Committee members V S Chauhan, AICTE chairman Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and UGC secretary Rajnish Jain will hold the next round with students in JNU, sources in the HRD Ministry confirmed.</p>
      <p>The high-powered committee was set up by the HRD Ministry late Sunday to “recommend ways to restore normal functioning in JNU”.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the panel met the university administration represented by 13 deans. JNU Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar Tuesday skipped this meeting despite an invitation. Teachers have been invited for interaction Thursday.<br/>On Wednesday, the committee appealed to the students to “restore normalcy”. Members of the students’ union, however, said protests would continue till the hostel fee is rolled back.</p>
      <p>The student representatives placed three demands before the committee members. First, they want the new inter-hall administration (IHA) manual revoked. Second, another IHA meeting involving the students’ union and hostel presidents, should be held to deliberate on hostel issues. And lastly, the resignation of Kumar and Dean of Students Umesh Kadam, which they referred to as “a must for restoring normalcy in the university”.</p>
      <p>JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said that the constitution of the committee itself reflects a breakdown in the internal processes of the university. She added that the union did not meet the committee to enter into “negotiations” with them.</p>
      <p>“There is no dialogue process within the university. Any communication with the V-C is through Twitter or videos shared on e-mail… The high-power committee should not think that we had gone there to do negotiations. If there is any decision on the hostels, it has to happen in the university through a fresh IHA meeting, in accordance with university statutes,” she said.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> Tuesday, Home Minister Amit Shah was briefed on the standoff by HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Monday. Shah called a second meeting with Pokhriyal on Tuesday in which he is learned to have expressed concerns over the steep hike in fees.</p>
