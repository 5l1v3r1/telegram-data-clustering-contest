      <p>The <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/4-ways-to-prepare-for-uncertainty-in-business.html">economic outlook</a> at any given point in time can cause confusion. Is the market bullish or bearish? What if Wall Street is happy but wages aren't keeping pace and thus <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/8-website-design-improvements-that-will-attract-new-customers.html">customers</a> are tightening their belts? </p>
      <p>One thing we can say for sure is that traditional markers of economic growth and stability show the U.S. economy is improving. Hiring is up, and employment is down. California just posted it's lowest unemployment numbers in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-15/californias-unemployment-rate-record-low">more than four decades</a>. However, there are always doubts about the economy when <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-white/student-loans-hit-144-trillion-how-debt-is-destroying-our-economy.html?cid=search">debt is high</a> and many people have little extra spending money.</p>
      <p>What are some unconventional but beneficial moves for small businesses to make in this economic climate, then? Here are a few options.  </p>
      <h3>Invest in upgrades now, not later.</h3>
      <p>Typical posts about recession-proofing your business would have you save up and hunker down for the inevitable economic downturn. While saving up is always a good thing, sometimes the best strategy to meet economic uncertainty is to grow before it arrives. Growth requires facilities sufficient to sustain increased demand. Consequently, now's a great time for your business to invest in better equipment and facility upgrades. </p>
      <p>Make sure you line up funding before you begin a facility overhaul or equipment buying spree, however. Start shopping around now for the best funding options. Explore bank loans, lines of credit, or other kinds of financing from different sources so you can find the most competitive terms available to you. </p>
      <p>The types of financing available to small business owners are increasing these days. Financial and risk-management technologies are making the extension of business credit in the form of loans or revolving lines of credit more attractive for lenders. That means you'll have an easier time securing financing now than, say, later on, if the economy takes a turn for the worse. </p>
      <h3>Add mobile payment options.</h3>
      <p>How easy do you make it for your customers to make purchases? According to a <a href="https://merch.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/pdfs/smallbusinesspaymentspotlight2019.pdf">recent Bank of America report</a>, 46 percent of small businesses were equipped to take digital payments in 2018, a substantial increase from 36 percent in 2017. </p>
      <p>Expanding your customer base and making it easier for those customers to make purchases is one of the soundest investments you can make in your business. Leaning into digital payment technology isn't something that's usually at the top of the list for most companies when times are lean. With a healthier economy right now, make sure you're keeping up with the technological times and helping your mobile customers give you their business. </p>
      <h3>Attract top talent.</h3>
      <p>If you want your business to dominate your industry, or even just a slice of it, you'll need the best possible people on your team. Figure out ways to <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/how-to-stop-someone-from-backing-out-after-accepting-your-job-offer.html">court the best workers</a> in their fields for open positions. </p>
      <p>A key strategy for accomplishing this goal is to examine what your industry leaders do. What kind of compensation packages are they offering? Where do they recruit? Do they offer college internships, and are they paid or unpaid? Adopt and adapt their tactics to suit your own business. </p>
      <h3>Plan to expand.</h3>
      <p>The crash of 2008 put a lot of business plans on hold. While the economy has certainly improved, that sense of pressure and crisis is hard to shake off. And, many companies have shied away from significant investments. </p>
      <p>Therefore, an unconventional tactic may be to dust off those expansion plans. Be careful though. Evaluate your revenue and cash flow projections to make sure your future earnings warrant such a move. If so, then proceed with those plans if the expansion still makes sense for your business. However, remember that goals you set years ago may not necessarily fit your business today. </p>
      <h3>Attack your debt, and build up reserves.</h3>
      <p>Pay down both personal and business <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/5-ways-entrepreneurs-can-reduce-their-debt.html">debt</a> where you can. High levels of credit-card debt can rack up thousands, especially with interest rates in the double-digits. If you have college student loans, pay those down as well. </p>
      <p>Also, agressively add more to personal savings and build up cash reserves for your business. Extra cash on hand will come in handy during a downturn. </p>
      <p>Get a professional opinion and advice about other smart money moves. Hiring a personal or business financial planner is a savvy investment. In addition, expand your own knowledge in other ways. Read books on the economy and financial planning, take a course at your local college or online, and spend more time keeping up with financial developments through news sites and financial blogs. </p>
      <p>Finally, set realistic, yet challenging financial goals, both for yourself and your business. Goals that feel like a bit of a stretch are usually the ones that keep us fired up and motivated. Write down your goals and then figure out how you can achieve them within a realistic timeframe. </p>
