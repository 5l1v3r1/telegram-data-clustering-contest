      <p>This Friday, 22 November, Singaporean superstar Amir Khan wants to show the whole world what he’s made of. He wants to remind fans just how dangerous of a lightweight he truly is.</p>
      <p>The Singaporean athlete returns to the Circle to square off with Malaysian-Kiwi powerhouse Ev “E.T.” Ting at ONE: EDGE OF GREATNESS. He wants to make a case as still one of the top contenders in ONE Championship. The bout will be held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old admits to having a difficult year. He believes he could have performed much better in the ONE Lightweight World Grand Prix. That’s why he is hoping to end the year on a high note by beating another top lightweight in Ting.</p>
      <p>“It’s not really a big story. One or two years ago, we wanted to fight each other and we were supposed to fight each other, but things didn’t happen. So recently, I just thought it would make perfect sense for us to fight each other,” Khan said of the opportunity to face Ting.</p>
      <p>“Among anyone else in the division, I think we both make a good match-up. He commented [on Instagram] that he would like to face me and then I just replied, ‘Yeah, why not?’ After that, [the matchmakers] sent out the contract.”</p>
      <p>Khan feels the tremendous pressure of defending his honor and proving himself worthy after a painful set of losses. Both Khan and Ting were present in the ONE Lightweight World Grand Prix but neither advanced.</p>
      <p>“I want to prove that I belong because right now, I’m coming off a losing streak, so a lot of people are doubting me. Not only to everyone, but I just want to prove to myself that I am a top-level [mixed martial artist], and I can come back and rise again,” said Khan.</p>
      <p>“I would be looking at what happens after the fight like I’m going to celebrate, I want to win, and how I feel after the fight. I was focusing on that instead of the fight itself.”</p>
      <p>Of course, Khan has done his homework on Ting, who offers a different set of challenges. He’s ready for whatever Ting brings to the table.</p>
      <p>“For me, as a ranged fighter, I need to keep the range throughout the fight because he is good at closing the distance. It’s good to practice and test myself against such a fighter in such situations.”</p>

      <p>“I haven’t fully mastered my range, so I feel it will be a good test for me to challenge myself against someone like Ev Ting because he is one of the best guys in the lightweight division to get in close to people.”</p>
      <p>Training with the World Champions at Evolve MMA, Khan continues to hone his skills on a daily basis. He and his team have come up with what they believe is a solid strategy against Ting.</p>
      <p>“I won’t tell you what I’m working on, but I’m just going to be in positions that he is not comfortable at — not just in striking, but overall mixed martial arts. My game plan is just to make him uncomfortable,” said Khan.</p>
      <p>As a record-holder for most knockout wins in ONE Championship, Khan’s bouts have no doubt ended early. This time, however, he wants time to show fans the skills he’s been working on.</p>
      <p>“I want to have one or two rounds with him and showcase my skills throughout,” said Khan.</p>
      <p>“I just need to be patient, not rush to anything, and not use too much energy for no reason other than to display my skills at the best level. I will still go for the finish, but I’m not thinking about it. I’m sure I will get it, but I am not really too focused on that. I am just focused on displaying my skills.”</p>
