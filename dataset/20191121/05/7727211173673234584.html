      <h2>Some Reds fans will need to take action to make sure they can take part</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/liam-thorp/" target="_blank">Liam Thorp</a></address>
      <p>Some Liverpool fans are running out of time to ensure they are able to take part in next month's crucial General Election.</p>
      <p>The December 12 vote - seen by many as the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/register-vote-before-deadline-november-17286810">most important for a generation</a> - is now just weeks away.</p>
      <p>And the deadline for registering to vote is now just days away.</p>
      <p>Everyone in England, Scotland or Wales who wants to vote in any capacity must have submitted their application by 11.59pm on Tuesday November 26 (the deadline is November 21 in Northern Ireland).</p>
      <p>Applications to register to vote can be made online at <a href="http://gov.uk/register-to-vote">gov.uk/register-to-vote</a></p>
      <p>That same deadline applies for those who want to vote by post - which could affect a number of Liverpool fans.</p>

      <p>Liverpool travel to Austria to face Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League on December 10 - just two days before the election.</p>
      <p>Some fans may have booked travel back to the UK on the 12th itself or later - and could risk missing election day.</p>
      <p>Other fans have been reportedly planning to travel straight from Austria to Qatar to watch their side compete in the Club World Cup on December 18 - meaning they would definitely be out of the country for the vote.</p>
      <p>These potential issues have been flagged by LFC fans group Spion Kop 1906 - who are urging all fans to ensure they are registered to vote - and for those travelling to ensure they take part in a postal vote before the election.</p>
      <h3>How to register to vote in a general election</h3>
      <p>You need to be on the electoral register to be able to vote in elections and referendums.</p>
      <p>If you move home, change your name or get a new nationality, you'll need to register again.</p>

      <p>Most voting takes place in person, so if you think you might be away from home on the day of a general election, you can register for a postal vote.</p>
      <p>The government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">has an online application form for vote registration here</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/register-to-vote-paper-forms">You can also register by post here</a> .</p>
      <h3>What you need to register to vote</h3>
      <p>You'll need your National Insurance number (you can find this on your payslip or any official letters about tax, pensions or benefits) and your passport if you're a British citizen living abroad.</p>

      <h3>How students can register to vote</h3>
      <p> If you're a student, you may be able to vote at either your home or term-time addresses.</p>
      <p> It's important to note you can only vote at one address - voting more than once in the same election is illegal.</p>
      <h3>Postal vote</h3>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, a postal vote could be an important way for many travelling Liverpool fans to ensure they don't miss out on the chance to have their say in this election.</p>
      <p>It is easy to do via a form that can be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-postal-vote">found here</a>.</p>
      <p>You must return your postal vote application form by 5pm, 11 working days before the poll for it to be valid.</p>
      <h3>Proxy vote</h3>
      <p>Another way for people who are unable to vote to take part is by proxy.</p>
      <p>This means you can get someone else to vote in your place.</p>
      <p>You can only apply for a proxy vote under certain circumstances, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>being away on polling day</li>
        <li>having a medical issue or disability</li>
        <li>not being able to vote in person because of work or military service</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/proxy-voting-application-forms">Apply for a proxy vote</a>  using a paper form. You need to send it to your local Electoral Registration Office.</p>
      <p>Usually, you need to apply for a proxy vote at least six working days before election day if you want to vote in England, Scotland or Wales.</p>
