      <h1>Ride-Hailing Apps Have Allowed More Binging and Increased Demand For Bartenders</h1>

      <p>A study published last week analyzed ridesharing's effects on binge drinking and found that it <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/11/19/after-uber-arrives-heavy-drinking-increases">increased heavy drinking by around 20% and increased employment at bars and restaurants by an average of 2%</a>. The Economist reports: <i>A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3485062&amp;utm_source=morning_brew">new study</a> by three economists -- Jacob Burgdorf and Conor Lennon of the University of Louisville, and Keith Teltser of Georgia State University -- finds that the widespread availability of ride-sharing apps has indeed made it easier for the late-night crowd to binge. By matching data on Uber's availability with health surveys from America's Centers for Disease Control, the authors find that on average alcohol consumption rose by 3%, binge drinking -- where a person downs four or five drinks in two hours -- increased by 8%, and heavy drinking -- defined as three or more instances of binge drinking in a month -- surged by 9% within a couple of years of the ride-hailing company coming to town. Increases were even higher in cities without public transport, where the presence of Uber led average drinking to rise by 5% and instances of binge drinking to go up by around 20%. (Heavy drinking still rose by 9%.) Remarkably, excessive drinking was actually declining before Uber's appearance, giving further evidence that the firm's arrival affected behavior. <br/><br/>If people are likelier to drink a lot, but less likely to drive drunk, it is hard to say what the overall public-health impact of ride-hailing firms has been. That said, there is one group of individuals who clearly benefit from the presence of Uber, Lyft and others: bartenders. Messrs Burgdorf, Lennon and Teltser find that employment at bars and restaurants increases by an average of 2% whenever Uber enters the market.</i></p>
