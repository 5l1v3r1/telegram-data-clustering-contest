      <p>The man who led police on a wild chase across the South Okanagan and through multiple farmer’s fields will be sentenced to between 18-24 months in prison for the incident. </p>
      <p>Tyler Newton, 37, appeared in Penticton court Wednesday for sentencing on charges of flight from police, dangerous driving, obstruction and possession of stolen property for a chase on May 27. </p>
      <p>Court heard police found Newton early that morning sleeping in a stolen Jeep in OK Falls. When officers awoke him, he drove away south on Highway 97. </p>
      <p>Unmarked police cars trailed from a distance while he drove erratically. Newton crashed through a farm gate at a property on Road 2 in Oliver, eventually driving over a spike belt deployed by police. </p>
      <p>Despite puncturing three tires, Newton continued to flee “swerving all over the roadway,” said Crown prosecutor Ann Lerchs. </p>
      <p>Newton continued to drive down McKinney Road, spinning out between the Petro-Canada and OIB offices, where officers boxed him in. He slammed the Jeep into reverse into an occupied RCMP cruiser, then forward through a fence and into a tomato field on Black Sage Road. Newton smashed through 75 rows of tomatoes, also damaging an irrigation system. </p>
      <p>The chase continued onto Tucelnuit Drive where the Jeep got stuck on a lawn. As officers ordered Newton out of the SUV, he continued to spin the wheels. Police eventually had to break the driver’s window with a rock and deploy a Taser to arrest him three hours after the chase began.</p>
      <p>Lerchs said Newton has 42 criminal convictions and had been released from prison for a previous police chase just four months prior.</p>
      <p>She argued for a two year jail term and three years of probation. </p>
      <p>Defence lawyer James Pennington sought 18 months in jail, noting his client may not do well with probation. </p>
      <p>“I’ll just breach,” Newton blurted out over video conference.</p>
      <p>“It’s not that I purposely go out of the way to bust it [probation], it’s just hard when you got nowhere to live… cops in this area, they are kinda out to get me and look for me. They wait and find a reason to get me for anything."</p>
      <p>“I want to do better with myself. I want to make my dad proud of me, he’s about to die he’s 77 and not in the best of health,” Newton said, telling Judge Michelle Daneliuk he’s been trying to get into treatment for his meth addiction. </p>
      <p>Daneliuk reserved her decision until Dec. 10. Newton has been in prison since his arrest.</p>
