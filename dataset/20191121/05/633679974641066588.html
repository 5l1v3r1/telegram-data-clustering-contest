      <p>A 53-year-old man from Durban who was arrested for the possession of child pornography was sentenced to 15 years in prison this week.</p>
      <p>Gert Harmzen was arrested in June of 2018 after police confiscated 105 gigabytes of videos and images relating to child pornography in his possession.</p>
      <p>His arrest and successful prosecution follow a thorough investigation by the Provincial Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units who specialize in Serial and electronic crimes.</p>
      <p>Five years of his sentence were suspended.</p>
      <p>The Provincial Police Commissioner in Kwazulu Natal Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula applauded the team and said they were doing everything within their power to ensure that people caught for child pornography are removed from society and to get their names included in the National Sexual offenders register.</p>
      <p>Harmzen is the second man to be sentenced for the child pornography this week.</p>
      <p>On Monday a 44-year-old former Control Prosecutor from the Western Cape was sentenced to an effective 7 years in prison after he entered a plea agreement with the State.</p>
      <p>Dawid Lotz was found guilty of 157 charges of child pornography and one of sexual assault.</p>
