      <p>President Trump <a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20191120/trump-tours-apple-manufacturing-plant-in-austin">made his seventh trip to Texas</a> this year on Wednesday afternoon to tour a Flextronics plant in Austin where Apple assembles Mac Pro computers. After a 90-minute tour of the facility led by Apple CEO Tim Cook, Trump <a href="https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-remarks-by-president-trump-after-tour-of-apple-1839972590">praised Apple</a> and said "we're seeing the beginning of a very powerful and important plant." He later tweeted: "Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America."</p>
      <p>That isn't what happened.</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-remarks-by-president-trump-after-tour-of-apple-1839972590">his remarks</a>, Cook noted that before Trump's arrival he had broken ground on Apple's new $1 billion corporate campus less than a mile from it's current Austin campus, and that new facility will vastly expand Apple's non-manufacturing footprint in the area. But the Flextronics plant that has been making Mac Pros since 2013 <a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20191120/trump-tours-apple-manufacturing-plant-in-austin">employs about 500 people</a> and hasn't announced any plans to expand. Trump apparently has a history of claiming credit for the creation of existing manufacturing facilities.</p>

      <p>Apple's dominant product is still the iPhone, whose production is centered in China. In the latest quarter, Apple's iPhone sales were <a href="https://macdailynews.com/2019/10/30/apple-destroys-street-with-highest-q4-revenue-ever/">about five times as high as</a> revenue for all Macs, including laptops.</p>
