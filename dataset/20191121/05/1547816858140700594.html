        <b>Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has encouraged the makers of Ajay Devgn, Kajol and Saif Ali Khan starrer Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior to dub the film in as many languages possible!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yesterday, we reported how Ajay Devgn’s upcoming period drama <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/makers-of-tanhaji-the-unsung-warrior-pulled-up-by-sambhaji-organization-for-the-wrong-depiction/5dd53dc387fb571eff7e42bc">Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, which is based on Maratha fighter Tanaji Malusare, might land into a legal soup</a>. Reason being, it has faced objection from Sambhaji brigade, an organization that has raised three major points in the trailer and asked the makers to issue a clarification. As per them, the makers of Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior have distorted certain facts and presented in their way. However, one of the most influential political parties of Maharashtra - Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) – has lent their support towards this period drama. (ALSO READ - <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/tanhaji-the-unsung-warrior-trailer-salman-khan-hails-ajay-devgn-s-performance-says-tanhaji-manaji/5dd501b587fb571eff7e4270">Tanhaji-The Unsung Warrior Trailer: Salman Khan Hails Ajay Devgn’s Performance, Says ‘Tanhaji Manaji’</a>)</p>
      <p>The political party has often been in the news for opposing the release of several Hindi films in Marathi; however, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior seems to be an exception. The President of MNS’ Cine Wing, Ameya Vinod Khopkar, took to his social media and congratulated the entire team of Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior and said that the film should be dubbed in as many languages as possible. "MNS continues to oppose the release of Hindi films dubbed in Marathi. However 'Tanhaji 'is a film that should be dubbed in as many languages as possible and released across the globe," said Ameya Vinod Khopkar.</p>

      <p>As a response to his gesture, Ajay Devgn thanked the politician by replying, “Thank you Ameya &amp; MNS for allowing us to showcase our film Tanhaji in Marathi &amp; Hindi simultaneously. It's our privilege to be able to share the story of this brave Maratha warrior in his mother tongue as well as the National Language.”</p>
