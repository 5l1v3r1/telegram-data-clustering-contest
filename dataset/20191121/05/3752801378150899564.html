      <p>Here are some of his key findings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overall, the audit outcomes have regressed since 2014/2015 with only 80 auditees improving and 91 regressing. Only 100 (26%) of the auditees managed to produce quality financial statements and performance reports and to comply with key legislation, thereby receiving a clean audit. In 2014/2015, 106 auditees had clean audits.</li>
        <li>There were serious weaknesses in the financial management of national and provincial governments that had not been addressed over the past five years.</li>
        <li>The financial health of auditees continued to deteriorate - with departments in particular struggling to balance their finances.</li>
        <li>Unauthorised expenditure remained high at R1.365bn.</li>
        <li>There was an emerging risk of increased litigation and claims against departments. Over a third of the departments had claims against them above 10% of their next year's budget.</li>
        <li>A deficit of R62.06bn was incurred by the 31% of public entities whose expenditure exceeded their revenue - 90% of the deficit related to the Road Accident Fund.</li>
        <li>Fruitless and wasteful expenditure continued to rise, with 223 auditees losing R849m in the current year. Over the five years, R4.16bn of government expenditure was fruitless and wasteful.</li>
        <li>Irregular expenditure increased to R62.60bn from the R51bn reported last year.</li>
      </ul>
