      <h1>Man Utd and Arsenal transfer target Dejan Kulusevski responds to speculation</h1>
      <h2>Teenager has helped loan club Parma up to eighth in Serie A and has been watched by Manchester United and Arsenal scouts for some time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:26:22+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:26</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United and Arsenal target Dejan Kulusevski has insisted he is not thinking about the January transfer window after impressing for Parma this season.</p>
      <p>Kulusevski first caught the eye of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> scouts while playing for Atalanta two seasons ago, while he came to the attention of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> after joining Parma on loan this term.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old, who can play anywhere across the midfield, was playing for Parma in their 2-0 win over Roma while United scouts were in Italy keeping tabs on Red Devils defender Chris Smalling, who is on loan at the Giallorossi.</p>
      <p>Kulusevski has scored two goals and provided five assists in 12 Serie A appearances for Parma this season - but says he is not thinking about a move at the moment.</p>
      <p>"I’m fine at Parma, I’m happy to be here, I’ve found the perfect club,’ said the teenager in quotes reported by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/man-utd-arsenal-target-dejan-kulusevski-speaks-transfer-speculation-11189884/">Metro</a> .</p>

      <p>Asked about the possibility of a January move, Kulusevski said: "The market? I’m playing well, so it’s normal to write about other clubs, but I don’t think about (a January move) because I have an annual deal with Parma."</p>
      <p>Kulusevski made his debut for Sweden over the recent international break, coming off the bench in a 3-0 victory over the Faroe Islands.</p>
      <p>He has helped Parma up to eighth in Serie A this season and is valued at £5.4million according to football stats <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/dejan-kulusevski/profil/spieler/431755">transfermarkt</a> .</p>
      <p>Both United and Arsenal could use some extra creativity in their ranks after underwhelming starts to their Premier League campaigns, with both currently off the pace in the race for the top four.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> are also interested in the midfielder, according to Metro, but could be trumped if United or Arsenal decide to shell out for the midfielder.</p>
