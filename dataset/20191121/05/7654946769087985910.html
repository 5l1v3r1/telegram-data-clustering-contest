      <h1>City will finally move garbage trucks stinking up the East Village</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:39:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:39</time> by <a rel="author">Bernadette Hogan and Julia Marsh</a></address>
      <p>The city has finally decided to move garbage trucks that had been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/01/state-lawmakers-tackle-trash-trucks-stinking-up-nyc-streets/">stinking up the East Village</a> for over a year following complaints from residents and lawmakers.</p>
      <p>The trucks had been parked on East 10th Street between First and Second avenues every night from 7 P.M. until 6 A.M. and all day on Sunday — ever since the city’s Department of Sanitation lost its lease on a West Side parking garage in 2018.</p>
      <p>The trucks will be moved temporarily to Pier 42.</p>
      <p>“When New Yorkers want something done, they want it done yesterday, which is why we’d like to thank our neighbors in the East Village for bearing with us while we found a new home for our sanitation trucks,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“We heard their concerns and we’ve responded. Residents can once again enjoy the clean streets and sidewalks that the Department of Sanitation provides without obstruction.”</p>
      <p>The stench got so bad residents <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/18/pols-residents-demand-city-move-trash-trucks-lining-manhattan-block/">complained to state lawmakers</a> who introduced legislation earlier this month to ban trash trucks from parking overnight on residential blocks.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, life will resume to normal for the residents and small businesses along East 10th Street who’ve been dealing with this stinky situation for over a year,” said the legislation’s sponsor state Sen. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan).</p>
