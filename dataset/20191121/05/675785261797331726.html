      <p>Garages and gardens are the two most important things prospective buyers search for when looking for somewhere new to live.</p>
      <p>That's according to analysis of what people have been searching for on Zoopla over the past year.</p>
      <p>Bungalows were also in high demand as a lack of stairs appeals to older homeowners and people with mobility issues.</p>
      <p>Laura Howard, a consumer expert at Zoopla, said: "The once unfashionable bungalow continues to make a comeback highlighting an ageing population that wants to enjoy the benefits that single-floor living provides."</p>
      <p>Searches for larger detached homes for growing families were also common, as were those for properties in a rural location or with a sea view.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The analysis also found that searches for cottages were particularly common in the Midlands, northern England, the East of England, the South West and Scotland.</p>
      <p>While garage was the most popular search term used generally, house hunters in London were most likely to crave some outdoor greenery, with garden being the most common search term used there.</p>
      <p>With property prices in London being higher typically than elsewhere, Help to Buy was another popular search term used in the capital.</p>
      <p>In Wales and Scotland, house hunters appeared to be particularly likely to be looking for privacy, with the search term secluded appearing on their top 10 lists.</p>
