      <p>Hazardous smoke blanketed Sydney on Thursday as wildfires burned across eastern and southern Australia.</p>
      <p>Thick smog shrouded Australia’s most populous city, leaving its iconic skyline barely visible two days after smoke created serious air quality issues.</p>
      <p>The New South Wales Rural Fire Service said the smoke came from some of the 50-plus wildfires burning mainly in northern parts of the state. Air pollution levels were reading nearly 10 times higher than the national standard.</p>
      <p>“The smoke is expected to continue for several days,” the fire service said.</p>
      <p>Wildfires have destroyed more than 600 homes in the state of New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital.</p>

      <p>The annual Australian fire season normally peaks during the southern hemisphere summer, but has started early after an unusually warm and dry winter.</p>
      <p>People with respiratory or heart conditions were advised to stay indoors and seek medical advice when necessary.</p>
      <p>The fire danger has also spread, with authorities declaring a high fire risk for parts of the southern state of Victoria. It is the first time in a decade Victoria has been declared Code Red, with the highest possible fire risk and a statewide total fire ban.</p>
      <p>Temperatures were forecast to breach 40C (104F) in the state’s north.</p>
      <p>Victoria Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp warned Victorians to be vigilant.</p>
      <p>“Given fires could start and move quickly, you won’t always receive a warning or be told what to do if a fire starts,” he said.</p>
      <p>The fire danger was also elevated to “severe” in the island state of Tasmania, while more than 40 wildfires have broken out in South Australia.</p>
