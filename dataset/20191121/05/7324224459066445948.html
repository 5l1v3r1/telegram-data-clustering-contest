      <h2>The memory of a Black Country boy is being honoured by a charity appeal in his name.</h2>

      <p>Oliver's Trike Appeal was set up by Scott and Caroline Tuckwell after the death of their only son Oliver in May, as a way of helping children who suffer from the same significant mobility problems as he had.</p>
      <p>Oliver was able to move around after Wolverhampton-based charity Power Pleas Trust provided him with a specially-adapted tricycle which aided his mobility and development.</p>
      <p>The Oliver's Trike Appeal has been launched to help raise Â£5,400 for Power Pleas and will see regular fundraising activities, with a pledge to raise sufficient money to provide a trike annually for a child.</p>
      <p>The appeal has already raised enough money to provide the first trike, with seven-year-old Keirah-Lei Summers the beneficiary of the trike which will help strengthen muscles in the correct pattern of movement and increasing balance to help improve self-confidence and increase independence.</p>
      <p>Keirah-Lei's mother Sue spoke about the benefits the trike will have for her daughter.</p>
      <p>She said: "We have had delight from the trike because Keira-Lei was free and her legs would normally struggle, but not with the bike. This is her second Trike and she goes everywhere on it."</p>
      <p>Keith Berry MBE, a founding member of Power Pleas, spoke about the legacy left by Oliver for other children.</p>
      <p>He said: "The loss of Oliver can only be experienced by Scott and Caroline and they have chosen to help other children with life enhancing trikes that he had. He will continue to be an inspiration to us all as he was."</p>
