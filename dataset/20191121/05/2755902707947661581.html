      <p>Mpilo Central Hospital  was forced to hold its nurses graduation and prize giving day under  police guard at the Bulawayo Large City Hall (yesterday) Wednesday in a bid to deter disgruntled members of the public who are still nursing anger over the recruitment process of nurses at the institution.</p>
      <p>This follows after it emerged that only 4 out of 24 of the newly recruited nurses are local residents. This courted the ire of activists and political parties who felt locals are being sidelined.</p>
      <p>Furious ZAPU activists previously besieged Mpilo’s nursing school bringing lessons to a halt, demanding a fresh recruitment process with more locals.</p>
      <p>Police were deployed both at the hospital in the morning and at the graduation venue in anticipation of trouble.</p>
      <p>Fortunately there was no trouble as the process went on smoothly.</p>
      <p>The graduation and prize giving ceremony saw 71 general nurses and 58 midwives enrolled in the year – November 2018 to October 2019 – graduate.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cite.org.zw/mpilo-nurses-graduate-under-police-guard/">According to reports by CITE</a>, guest of Honour, Deputy Director in the Minister of State for Bulawayo Metropolitan’s office, Agnes Makoni, representing Judith Ncube delivered a speech which made no mention of the controversial recruitment process.</p>
      <p>Makoni noted that health was not only an important attribute of life but a human right and not a privilege.</p>
      <p>She however acknowledged that currently, Zimbabwe’s health sector is in shambles but those challenges must be put into perspective as they have bearing on the current health status of health care.</p>
