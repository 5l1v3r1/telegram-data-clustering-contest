      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — The ongoing unrest at Hong Kong has affected the pockets of its celebrities.</p>
      <p>Quoting Hong Kong actor Ruco Chan, <i>Oriental Daily</i> reported that artistes’ money-making opportunities have been reduced.</p>
      <p>“It has definitely impacted us. But being a citizen of Hong Kong, we will continue to work. If today’s site is not suitable, we will move to another site the next day.”</p>
      <p>“I think we should not be looking towards money every time, I think the more important thing is for everyone to be happy, healthy and have a comfortable environment. As even though you earn a lot of money but without health it will be pointless. There must be balance,” said the <i>Unholy Alliance</i> actor.</p>
      <p>On cancellation of TVB’s live telecast anniversary celebration, Chan said the artistes only found out about the matter the day before the event.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s <i>Ming Pao</i> reported Chan as saying that although he was unhappy with the arrangements as a participating artiste, he understood the station was forced to make the move due to safety concerns.</p>
      <p>This is the first time in the station’s 52-year history where its anniversary celebration was not telecast live.</p>
      <p>The live telecast, initially slated for November 19, was instead replaced by a recording of what was supposed to be the final rehearsal.</p>
