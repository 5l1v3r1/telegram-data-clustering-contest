      <p>A friend while discussing Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s dropping of the title “Excellency” for “Mr.  Governor” said; just tell him “to get on with the job”. Well, I agree. The governor was just being modest and humble. To put this discussion correctly, the first governor to decree this usage of “Mr. Governor” was my state governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi. Aliyu Babangida, former governor of Niger State used to refer to himself as “servant leader” of his state. This did not stop the real servants from shouting “Rankya dedeh” while groveling before him. On a serious note, this usage of Mr. Governor is American. It is normal to say “Mr. President” or “Mr. Governor” in the United States. The British also say “Mr. Prime Minister”.</p>
      <p>On the continent of Europe, the French will say “Monsieur, le President”; the Germans refer to their chancellor” Herr Bundeskanzler” and if a woman “Frau Bundeskanzlerin” which is the same as Mr. President or governor. But when official letters are addressed to them, the title “Your Excellency” is appropriate. This is why all ambassadors also bear the title of Excellency because technically they represent the person and office of the heads of state or government who send them and not the countries where they come from. This is why when there is a turnover and when regimes change and if the ambassador must be kept in post, a new letter of accreditation signed by the new head of state could be required and requested.</p>
      <p>It is not the title that matters; it is the humility and sense of a mission that one brings to office that matters. Sanwo-Olu and Kayode Fayemi are right by suggesting they do not want to be flattered by titles as many sycophants would want to do. There is no need to over-spiritualise what is essentially a secular thing by saying only God is excellent. We all know that. Politicians should please not use God/Allah to cover their incompetence. It is how they are remembered by posterity that should matter. The story was once told about a farmer in Ekiti who during the presidential election of 1999 was found going to his farm and when accosted by electoral officials who told him about voting being part of his civic responsibilities, he said innocently with peasant simplicity and honesty, that he thought election had ended with Awolowo’s demise in 1987. As far as he was concerned, Awolowo was the “End of History “to borrow a phrase from the Japanese-American historian Francis Fukuyama’s book – “The End of History and The Last Man”. Awolowo’s legacy was etched into this poor farmer’s mind, not by the roads and buildings he constructed, but by the single stride taken to universalize education in the old Western Region. This is the same way Lateef Jakande is remembered for abolishing the shift school system in Lagos. Many young people in Lagos need to be reminded of this great Leap Forward. I doubt if the pre-Jakande system of some pupils starting school when the first stream finished at 2 p.m. existed anywhere in the world except Lagos Nigeria. Rauf Aregbesola, former governor of Osun State will also in the course of time be remembered for revolutionizing education in that poor state. If I were Sanwo-Olu, I would look critically at what I can leave as permanent legacy in Lagos for which children unborn would remember me  and which a million Excellencies would not do. He has a better chance to do this than many of his other colleagues like Kayode Fayemi but who are hampered by poor economic resources of their states. He has several choices he can make. He can make Lagos a real state by developing other towns in the state apart from the city of Lagos. Badagry, Epe, Ikorodu, Itoikin and other towns and villages are waiting to share in the Lagos development boom. Imagine building a bridge to link Lekki with Ikorodu! The Lagos government needs to open up the physical space of Lagos to avoid the city being suffocated by the unrelenting waves and flood of people from the Nigerian hinterland.</p>
      <p>It is not only the governor of Lagos who should have an enduring and lovely legacy. Muhammadu Buhari needs it even more. It will be wonderful if our president can, while fighting corruption, important as it is, face the mission of providing electricity for this country. He does not have much time left in his second regime. I pray that his government’s deal with the German company Siemens to do the kind of magic it did in Egypt where within five years, it delivered about 14000 megawatts into the Egyptian grid. The deal with this company backed by the governments of Nigeria and Germany is programmed to deliver 25000 megawatts of electricity by 2025. If this happens, Buhari’s name will remain forever blessed by Nigerians. Right now, our total installed capacity is less than 10000 megawatts and what is nationally available ranges from 3000 to 4000 megawatts which is ridiculous for a country of at least 160 million.</p>
      <p>One wonders what our governments have been doing since 1960. Yet it is obvious that our country cannot develop without electricity. We will not be able to run electric trains in the future. Now that electric cars are in the horizon, we would not be able to join the civilized world in the new environmentally friendly automobile revolution of the future. Without electricity, we cannot run modern hospitals. Our universities cannot function properly and agricultural products would rot in our tropical heat. We cannot industrialize our production. In short, nothing will work unless we sort out the problem of electricity. Not only our economy depends on it but our lives as well.</p>
      <p>It is this kind of landmark achievement that distinguishes a man of action from an ordinary leader of a country. Mustapha Kemal, the Ataturk of Turkey with determination turned an effete remnant of a great empire into a modern state overnight. Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt was a lightning rod in the modernization of Egypt. General Charles Andre Joseph Marie de Gaulle pulled out France from humiliation and defeat to the status of a major power in modern times. Winston Churchill mobilized the British to successfully resist the Germans during the Second World War. Joseph Stalin after the loss of millions of his people to the indomitable Germans was able to roll back the German panzer divisions that made mincemeat of his country and successfully got to the German capital in 1945. There are African avatars like Kwame Nkrumah, Sekou Toure, and Nelson Mandela who occupy unique positions in modern African political history. Of what use is life if all we do is to live and die without leaving a mark. If anybody has the opportunity to lead his people whether at the national or sub national level, such a person should count himself of herself lucky and try to make a mark and not get bogged down with semantics about titles.</p>
      <p>Having said this there are titles that may be worth keeping because of traditions. The religious orders are hierarchical. There are cardinals, Arch bishops, arch deacons, canons and reverends and reverend fathers in the Christian religion. There are sultans, caliphs, grand Ayatollahs, Ayatollahs, imams, sheiks, Amir and so on in the Islamic world. The military is also hierarchical in organization and you have field marshals, generals, lieutenant- generals, major-generals, brigadier-generals, colonel, and lieutenant colonel, majors, captains, lieutenant and second lieutenants in that order and corresponding equivalents in the navy and air forces. The same goes for the diplomatic corps where you have ambassadors, consul generals, consuls, ministers, minister counselors and so on. Removing their titles would cause chaos because these institutions conform to certain norms of universal order which hardly varies in meaning from one country to the other. The title of governor as head of a unit of government is not universal. They may be called prefect as in France, minister- president as in Germany and excellencies usually do not apply to sub national heads of government. Of course there is nothing stopping Nigeria from reducing titles from elsewhere  to their own  pedestrian level as we have done by calling village and clan heads their majesties and rulers without empires their imperial majesties !</p>
