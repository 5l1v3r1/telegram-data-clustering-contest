      <p>As of yesterday the country’s biggest electronic cash platform, Ecocash was still experiencing glitches with no remarkable improvement in sight but with them assuring customers that the platform would soon stabilise as it was working “round the clock” to optimise “a few components”.</p>
      <p>This follows a system upgrade that started on Saturday and was expected to end on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In a statement to the <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/ecocash-services-remain-subdued/">Herald </a>last night, Cassava Smartech Zimbabwe, the company that owns EcoCash, said the process of stabilising its new platform was “nearly” complete and pleaded for patience as it worked to “optimise” the performance of the service.</p>
      <aside>“We once again would like to thank our valued customers for bearing with us during this critical period in which we are now optimising the various EcoCash services in a live environment,” said Mr Eddie Chibi, the CEO of Cassava Smartech Zimbabwe.<br/>“The core of our platform is now working quite well, but some work is still continuing on the optimisation of a few components that involve integration to third parties. We sincerely apologise to our customers for the inconvenience this may have caused them.”</aside>
      <p>EcoCash also advised its users on social media platforms yesterday</p>
      <aside>PUBLIC NOTICE – We would like to advise you that the Ecocash Platform performance has improved. However some customers may still experience service issues.<br/>#LiveLifeTheEcoCashWay #LifelsDigital #EcocashUpgrade<br/>Kindly bear with us as we work to resolve all outstanding issues.<br/>We apologize for the inconvenience caused.<br/>Live Life the Ecocash Way!</aside>
      <p>The major system upgrade was meant to improve system availability, user experience, security and long-term capacity issues</p>
