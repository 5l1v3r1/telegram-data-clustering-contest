      <h3>Fremantle has avoided a potential draft night disaster after taking part in a three-way trade along with Melbourne and Adelaide.</h3>
      <p>With next generation academy prospect Liam Henry drawing interest from a number of clubs, namely Melbourne (Pick 8) and Carlton (Pick 9), the Dockers were stuck in a hard place with Pick 10 in the draft.</p>
      <p>While the Dockers had the option of trading Pick 10 when on the clock, the club has elected to do a deal before the night.</p>

      <p>First, the Crows and Dockers struck a deal which allowed for the Dockers to receive 119 extra points which will help in matching Henry’s bid.</p>
      <p>The Crows received Pick 22 and a 2020 third-round pick (tied to Collingwood) in exchange for Pick 28, 49 and a 2020 fourth-round pick (tied to Carlton).</p>
      <p>“We weren’t going to use pick 49 on the night so it was great we could improve our draft position in 2019 and 2020,” Adelaide list manager Justin Reid explained.</p>
      <p>Then the Dockers dealt Pick 10, Pick 28 and a 2020 fourth-round pick to the Demons, in return for Pick 8.</p>
      <p>It now means Fremantle will walk into the draft armed with back-to-back picks, with the club likely to consider Victorians Hayden Young and Caleb Serong at Pick 7 and 8.</p>
      <p>The Demons’ third selection in the draft was previously Pick 97, but now is Pick 28, allowing for the club to take three selections inside the top 30.</p>
      <p>Trading of selections will close for all AFL clubs on Friday November 22.</p>
