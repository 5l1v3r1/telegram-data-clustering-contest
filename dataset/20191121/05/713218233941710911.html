      <p>As a community we need to stay smart and be water wise as the current record-breaking drought highlights the importance of our ongoing efforts to protect one of our most precious resources: clean drinking water.</p>
      <p>That's why we have been working with the state government to proactively investigate our future water security and produce an options report which will identify the most efficient, sustainable ways to secure our shire's water supply.</p>

      <p>Council is also working towards finding better and smarter ways to monitor water usage across the catchment, including the staged delivery and installation of smart water meters across our shire that will enable council to automatically detect and notify residents of leaks in water services.</p>

      <p>The smart water meters will also empower residents to self-monitor their water usage by providing online access to live household water data, including total consumption figures and usage patterns by simply going online and logging onto a customer portal.</p>
      <p>Currently, council is installing smart water meters in sections of Urunga, and council crews will continue to work in this area and in Dorrigo where we hope to have at least 20 per cent of households connected to the smart meter system by the end of this financial year.</p>
      <p>Once installations in these two areas are completed, the first round of households fitted with smart water meters will be able to access the online customer portal to view their water usage in detail and introduce or monitor the performance of water-efficient household appliances and fixtures.</p>
      <p>Regular access to this type of data combined with sensible water use will not only help you save money, but it will also contribute towards ensuring that we have reliable access to clean water which is protected and used sustainably.</p>
      <p>In addition, our own secure yield analysis assessments are being undertaken to inform council's integrated water cycle management strategy to optimise the water, wastewater and stormwater services operated by council and ensure that we are a resilient community that is prepared for the future challenges our ever-changing environment presents us.</p>
