      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — Turning 91 is a momentous occasion.</p>
      <p>A week prior to me heading to Melaka (I had arrived in Malaysia four weeks before that for an internship), my own grandpa had turned 91. </p>
      <p>I had had the bright idea of sending him a postcard from what he believes is the “other side of the world” compared to his farm in Australia. </p>
      <p>A thoughtful birthday present, I thought. </p>
      <p>Little did I realise how difficult sourcing post cards would be in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>From my experience, postcards have always been one of the first things I stumble across when I am on holiday. </p>
      <p>Markets, US$2 stores — you cannot escape them.</p>

      <p>What I didn’t expect was to be in my fourth week in Malaysia and still not a postcard to be found. </p>
      <p>Not even a visit to Central Market where one can get all sorts of souvenirs helped in my hunt for these these elusive cards. </p>
      <p>Melaka, where I was heading with the rest of the Aussie interns for a day trip, seemed to be my best hope.</p>
      <p>Being a tourist hotspot, there would be shops and markets full to the brim of every knick knack a tourist could ever desire. </p>
      <p>I was sure I would be able to find a postcard. </p>
      <p>So, in between visiting the tourist spots, I continued my hunt.</p>
      <p>I looked and looked and halfway down Jonker street, I recruited four other people to help me find them.</p>
      <p>I thought I must have been going crazy and going half blind because they were nowhere to be found. </p>
      <p>With one every shop selling similar souvenirs, I had almost accepted that postcards just were not meant to be. </p>
      <p>Then suddenly, I saw them on a stand at one of the shops. </p>
      <p>You might think it is not a big deal, but for me it was a huge relief. </p>
      <p>I ended up buying three postcards with digital designs of Melaka landmarks and Malaysian food: one for grandpa, another for my housemates in Geelong and the last one for one of my friends.</p>
      <p>The postcards have since been sent off to them. </p>
      <p>Postcards aside, the whirlwind tour of Melaka turned out to be a fun one as after nearly a week of rain in KL, we were treated to sunny weather.</p>
      <p>This reminded all of us of home as the thick waves of heat seemed to appear from nowhere. </p>
      <p>We visited Jonker Street, also known as Harmony street for its various venues of worship in one area. </p>

      <p>One building that caught my attention was a Chinese temple where our tour guide told us that parts of a boat was used to make it. </p>
      <p>He said that one could see traces of spoons and other knick knacks if one looked closely at the roofing. </p>
      <p>We also hiked up to see the ancient St Paul’s church where we learnt about the arrival of the Dutch in Melaka and the siege that took place. </p>
      <p>The Dutch tombstones rest against the walls inside the church. </p>

      <p>I made a wish at the wishing well by dropping a coin down. It is said that because my coin did not make a sound when dropped, my wish will come true.</p>
      <p>Fellow intern said one highlight for her was to see an exhibit of a monkey made out of tin at the museum.</p>
      <p>“It was used in the 13th century. I also enjoyed being able to view the artworks and to learn about the history of Melaka prior to independence.”</p>

      <p>Food wise, the one thing that stood out for me was finally being able to taste cendol. </p>
      <p>I had heard about it and was all game to try the icy dessert. </p>
      <p>The mix of shaved ice, coconut milk, green rice jelly, kidney beans, and brown sugar did not disappoint with its sweet and milky flavours. </p>
      <p>Especially in the heat! Things definitely felt cooler after that dose of cendol. </p>
      <p>Tourist spots aside, there was also a juncture that we caught sight of a huge lizard near a river.</p>
      <p>“We later found out this was an Asian Water Monitor, but it did take our group by surprise seeing what we thought was a goanna climb out of the water and onto a bank to sun itself,” said fellow intern Katreena Albanis.</p>
      <p>Having ticked off the historical Melaka off my list, I am lookingn forward to exploring other parts of Malaysia. </p>
      <p>And maybe get a nyonya kebaya. </p>
      <p>This was something else that I thought of buying but decided against it as the tour guide said the attire was the “height of sex appeal” in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>So, who knows? The kebaya’s vibrant colours and graceful lines might just get the better of me and it might just make into my luggage. </p>
