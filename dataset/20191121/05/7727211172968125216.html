      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/liam-thorp/" target="_blank">Liam Thorp</a></address>
      <p>A 7-year-old child who wrote a letter to Father Christmas asking for a house and some food for her family is set to get some amazing Christmas surprises after a staggering amount of money was raised.</p>
      <p>This week the ECHO reported how Liverpool Councillor Gerard Woodhouse - who runs the L6 Community Centre in Everton -<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/desperate-child-7-writes-note-17273049"> found the heartbreaking letter in the Santa Postbox in the centre.</a></p>
      <p>It said: "Dear Father Christmas. Can you help? Can we have a home for Christmas?</p>
      <p>"Mam wants us to be all together, can you give us some food and can I just have just nice doll for Christmas. Thank you."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/football-star-child-father-christmas-17277713">Since the note was made public</a>, a huge number of people have reached out to offer support to the family and to the L6 Centre that helps many struggling people in north Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Cllr Woodhouse said that since the letter was featured in the ECHO and shared on social media, the centre has received close to Â£10,000 in donations.</p>

      <p>He explained how this money will be used to help the child's family and others.</p>
      <p>He said: "We cannot thank the public enough.</p>
      <p>"All the money raised will be spend on supporting families who are referred to us to try and make there Christmas special.</p>
      <p>"We are supporting the family of the child who wrote the letter with presents and a 3-day stay in a hotel over the Christmas period for the mum and kids, who do not usually live together."</p>
      <p>The plight of the child and their family has touched hearts all across the country.</p>
      <p>Amongst those offering support have been a local footballer and reality television star Gemma Collins.</p>
