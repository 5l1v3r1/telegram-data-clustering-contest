      <p>Ogun State has been selected among the successful participants in the coming National Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and United Nations’ Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation projects (FCPF/REDD+).</p>
      <p>The Director of Survey, Demarcation, Inventory and Extension, Ministry of Forestry, Mr. Adewale Shonubi, who spoke at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, said the programme, aimed at encouraging developing countries to reduce emission from deforestation and degradation by enhancing, sustaining, as well as conserving forest carbon stock, began with an assessment in the 36 states.</p>
      <p>He said 17 states were selected for reassessment, with seven pre-qualifying for the scoping mission assessment, where Ogun finally qualified among the last three selected states.</p>
      <p>Shonubi noted that the political will and support of the Governor Dapo Abiodun administration to the programme contributed to the prequalification and final selection of the state in the keenly scrutinised scoping mission assessment.</p>

      <p>The Director, Non–Timber Department, Dr. Gbotemi Adeleye, said government’s commitment to forest management and development strategy has raised the level of consciousness for forest communities’ participation in resources protection and sustenance towards achieving an all-round forest development system across the state.</p>
      <p>He said the climate change mitigation programme of the UN REDD+, as a Clean Development Mechanism, would not only reduce emission from deforestation and degradation, but also generate incentive funds to qualified states in their enhancement of forest carbon stock, through the FCPF/REDD+’s Readiness Carbon Fund.</p>
      <p>The director said the state would benefit financially for its effort at reducing emission from deforestation, thereby boosting forestry development projects and programmes, as the government remained committed to Public, Private Partnership investments to improve the state’s economy.</p>
