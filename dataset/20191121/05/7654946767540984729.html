      <h1>Antonio Brown countersues ex-trainer who claims he raped her</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:11:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:11</time> by <a rel="author">Kenneth Garger</a></address>
      <p>Antonio Brown is countersuing a former female trainer who claimed in a civil suit that the ex-NFL wide-receiver <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/10/antonio-brown-accused-of-raping-and-sexually-abusing-trainer/">raped her on three separate occasions</a>, a report said.</p>
      <p>Brown, 31, who has denied the allegations by Britney Taylor, is suing the woman for defamation and interference with his NFL contracts and endorsement, according to documents <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28125765/antonio-brown-countersuing-britney-taylor-defamation">obtained by ESPN</a>.</p>
      <p>Taylor, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/11/antonio-browns-rape-accuser-britney-taylor-met-him-at-bible-study/">who knew Brown since their college days</a>, filed her Sept. 10 suit three days after he was released from the Oakland Raiders.</p>
      <p>He later agreed to a deal with the New England Patriots — who allowed him to play in one game before cutting him on Sept. 20, once another round of allegations from a second woman surfaced against Brown.</p>
      <p>Brown’s countersuit is in response to Taylor’s filing, which had been refiled in Broward County Circuit Court on Nov. 1, the report said.</p>
      <p>Brown alleges in his suit that Taylor had attempted to secure from him a $1.65 million investment for her gymnastic business after he signed a lucrative $72 million with the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
      <p>“After enduring a failed business endeavor and also failing to gain the relationship status she desired with Brown,” his suit alleges, “Taylor began a vicious campaign of lies and deceit targeting Brown both personally and professionally.”</p>
      <p>“Taylor’s acts have all but ruined Brown’s career, causing him to lose a number of substantial and lucrative business contracts, and impacting the public persona in such a manner as to cause Brown and his family significant personal and financial harm.”</p>
      <p>Taylor’s lawyer, David Haas, fired back late Wednesday night, <a href="https://twitter.com/HaasLawPLLC/status/1197343389848653824">saying his client</a> “will not be bullied.”</p>
      <p>“Today, Antonio Brown countersued the woman he raped and blamed her for the self-destructive conduct that led to the demise of his NFL career,” said Haas.</p>
      <p>“In the past, Defendant Brown has used intimidation to avoid responsibility for his actions. However, Ms. Taylor will not be bullied and remains steadfast in holding Defendant Brown accountable.”</p>
      <p>Brown is under investigation by the NFL over the sexual assault claims and recently <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/antonio-brown-happy-after-marathon-meeting-with-nfl-brass/">met with the league</a> for about eight hours over the allegations.</p>
