      <h1>Google Assistant will now read out the latest news in the United States</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>Google on Tuesday revealed a new feature called “Your News Update” on the Assistant that will read users the latest news.</p>
      <p>This means that users can now say “Hey Google, play me the news”, and Google Assistant will oblige with “a mix of short news stories chosen at that moment based on your interests, location, user history and preferences”.</p>
      <p>According to Google, the longer you listen, the further the feature will take you into your favourite topics too.</p>
      <p>“In between stories, the Google Assistant serves as your smart news host that introduces which publishers and updates are next,” the company further noted.</p>
      <p>Throughout the year, Google has added a wide range of features to the Assistant, including <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/09/you-can-now-use-google-assistant-to-make-voice-and-video-calls-on-whatsapp/">voice and video call support for WhatsApp</a> and a new <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/09/google-assistant-ambient-mode/">Ambient Mode</a>.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the app can now <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/08/google-assistant-whatsapp-messages/">read out WhatsApp messages</a> to users as well.</p>
      <p>Your News Update, however, is currently available on the lastest Google Assistant update for users in the United States. The feature is set to roll out globally next year.</p>
