      <h1>Hostel fee hike means EWS students pay Rs 12,000 more per year in JNU</h1>

      <p>An economically weaker student at JNU will have to shell out an extra Rs 12,000 annually for hostel fee, even after concessions offered by the university administration, shows an analysis by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
      <p>This also means that the merit-cum-means (MCM) scholarship offered by JNU — for students whose parent’s income does not exceed Rs 20,833 per month — would now only cover roughly half of a student’s annual hostel and tuition fee.</p>

      <p>Under the old fee structure, it covered almost 75%. JNU is yet to define who all are eligible for a concession on hostel fee. For this analysis, The Indian Express has assumed that all MCM students will be able to avail the 50% concession.</p>
      <p>Currently, 18% of the 7,500 students at JNU receive Rs 2,000 per month as MCM scholarship. According to JNU’s November 13 statement, these students are among those eligible for 50% concession on room rent, utility charges and service charges.</p>

      <p>Under the revised fee structure approved by the JNU Executive Council on November 13, an EWS student covered under MCM and living in a double seater room will have to pay Rs 2,200 establishment charges, Rs 300 for crockery, utensils and newspaper, Rs 1,800 for room rent, Rs 10,200 towards service charges and approximately Rs 30,000 as mess bill annually. Along with annual tuition fee and other charges of Rs 400, the total expenditure comes to about Rs 44,900 per year. This doesn’t include utility charges for water and power, to be charged as per consumption.</p>
      <p>Under the old structure, a poor student living in the double-seater room paid Rs 2,200 as establishment charges, Rs 300 for crockery, utensils and newspaper, Rs 120 as room rent and approximately Rs 30,000 as mess bill annually.<br/>After accounting for annual tuition fee and other charges of Rs 400, the total expenditure of an EWS student covered under MCM would come to Rs 33,020 per year — or about Rs 12,000 less than under the new structure.</p>
