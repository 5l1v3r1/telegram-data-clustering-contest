        <b>Ade Adesomoju, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>A civil society organisation, Advocacy for Human rights and equal Opportunity, on Wednesday, asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to nullify the elongation of the tenure of some retiring Permanent Secretaries by President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p> The plaintiff joined as defendants, Buhari, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation and the Attorney General of the Federation.</p>
      <p>The group filed the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1427/2019, through its counsel, Danshitta Saheed.</p>
      <p>The plaintiff listed the concerned Permanent Secretaries as those deployed in the Federal Ministry of Interior, Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Federal Ministry of Water Resources and General Services Office in the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.</p>
      <p>AHREO prayed, among others, for a declaration that by virtue Section 171 (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), Buhari had no power or discretion to elongate or extend the term of office of the seven retiring Permanent Secretaries.</p>
      <p>It equally asked the court to declare that the act of the President extending the tenure of the retiring Permanent Secretaries “is ultra-vires, null and void, illegal and of no consequence”.</p>
      <p>It also sought a declaration that “the continuance being in office of the retiring Permanent Secretaries from the date they are due for retirement is illegal, unconstitutional and is against the spirit and later of Section 8 of Chapter 2, Rule 020810 of the Public Service Rules, 2008.”</p>
      <p>The plaintiff also sought “a declaration that all acts or functions performed by the retiring Permanent Secretaries from the dates of their respective retirement be declares illegal, null and void”.</p>
      <p>The group asked the court to issue an order of injunction restraining the retiring Permanent Secretaries from performing any act or functions of their respective offices.</p>
