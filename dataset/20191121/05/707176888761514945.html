      <h1>Why US farmers are falling out of love with Donald Trump</h1>
      <h2>As impeachment gathers momentum, anger over ethanol policy threatens the president in the Corn Belt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gregory Meyer</a></address>
      <p>Three stickers decorate a fire door inside the Siouxland Energy Co-operative of north-west Iowa. One with a green heart declares “I Love Ethanol”. Another shows a cartoon character urinating on the word Opec. A third says, “write your congressman”.</p>
      <p>Siouxland is a <a href="https://www.siouxlandenergy.com/">biofuel refinery</a>, taking corn by the truckload from some of the nation’s best land and brewing it <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a34ca8da-e6b0-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc">into ethanol</a> for car engines. Built with local farmers’ capital and political muscle, these plants have established a market for excess grain supplies over the past 15 years and helped cut US reliance on foreign oil.</p>
      <p>But this autumn, the plant laid idle for six weeks, one of dozens to have slowed or halted their operations even as demand for transport fuel creeps higher.</p>

      <p>Plant owners blame government waivers that allow smaller oil refineries to ignore quotas requiring biofuel use. The policy shift has capped demand growth and pressured prices for corn and soyabeans. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/93a21e84-0f55-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745">resulting pain for farmers</a> is now creating a problem for Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>“We pretty much supported President Trump in the last election,” says Kelly Nieuwenhuis, one of 391 local farmers with a stake in Siouxland. “I know the polls say he has still got a lot of strong [farmer] support, but I’ve heard a lot of people that won’t support him again because of biofuels.”</p>
      <p>The anger highlights the Trump administration’s difficulty satisfying rival constituencies in the Corn Belt and oilfields. The number of “small refinery exemptions”, or SREs, has shot up since 2017 and shaved 7.4 per cent from the government biofuel target in the latest round, according to the Energy Information Administration. The government says low-volume oil refineries are entitled to such waivers if they can prove hardship from biofuels quotas.</p>

      <p>This <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/90e50898-e93c-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061">obscure policy shift</a>, conducted in the shadow of national news about <a href="https://www.ft.com/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment</a>, is now weakening Mr Trump’s standing in a core voting bloc ahead of the 2020 elections.</p>
      <p>For many farmers, the waivers are the final straw after a year of suffering the costs of a <a href="https://www.ft.com/us-china-trade-dispute">trade war with China</a>, an extremely wet planting season and tougher loan terms. Scrambling to address their complaints, the White House has instead only intensified the outrage.</p>
      <p><b>There are big stakes at play.</b> Two in every five bushels of an estimated 347m tonne corn crop will be used to make ethanol this year, the Department of Agriculture estimates, so lower demand would be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/661bde2e-c408-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9">bearish for crop prices</a>. The biofuels industry is concentrated in several Midwestern states that backed Mr Trump in 2016, including Iowa, Indiana, Missouri and Nebraska.</p>
      <p>Federal law enabled the industry’s growth. The 2007 Renewable Fuel Standard mandated the annual use of at least 15bn gallons of corn ethanol and billions of gallons more for biodiesel and other renewable fuels. A vocal coalition of biofuels and grain trade groups have, with mixed success, used lobbying, campaign contributions and the courts to defend the standard in the face of attacks from the oil industry.</p>

      <p>Before the 2016 presidential election, Mr Trump backed the rules as a tool for US energy independence. “I am there with you 100 per cent,” he told a large crowd at the 2016 Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit. Earlier this year he abolished rules that had restricted <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3dad8ae0-04fc-11e3-9ffd-00144feab7de">ethanol blending</a> with petrol — delighting the world’s largest biofuels industry.</p>
      <p>But the relationship soured on August 9 when Mr Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency let 31 smaller oil refineries off the hook from their biofuels blending obligations, defying complaints about the 35 exempted in 2018 and 19 in 2017. In total the moves lowered the biofuels target by 4bn gallons, EPA data shows.</p>
      <p>The blows fell hardest on one of the most Trump-friendly slices of America. Sioux County, home to Siouxland Energy, ranks among the nation’s top 10 counties for corn production. It also gave Mr Trump more than 80 per cent of its vote in 2016. Another ethanol plant 30 miles away remains closed after shutting down in July, a mound of yellow corn outside.</p>

      <p>Farmers were already frustrated by the decline in soyabean, sorghum, ethanol and corn-based <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/93a21e84-0f55-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745">livestock feed exports</a> as a result of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/us-china-trade-dispute">US trade war with China</a>. In north-west Iowa’s fourth congressional district, goods exports to China fell by $558m in 2018 because of higher tariffs, the most of any district in the country, according to the US-China Business Council.</p>
      <p>The White House has compensated farmers for the cost of the trade war with an initial cash assistance programme worth $12bn last year and a further $16bn in a scheme due to end in January. More than 1m farm operations have received bailouts. “Our great Farmers will recieve (sic) another major round of ‘cash’, compliments of China Tariffs, prior to Thanksgiving,” Mr Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1196097712925691906">tweeted</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>This year 30 per cent of farm income will come from government payments and insurance indemnities backed by Washington, the highest share in at least a decade, USDA economists forecast.</p>
      <p>Yet Mr Nieuwenhuis, who farms 2,100 acres with his brothers, dismisses the government payments as a “spit in the bucket”. “We [have] worked for years and years and years to build relationships and grow markets,” he says. “And they can be destroyed with the stroke of a pen in the political realm.”</p>
      <p><b>Mr Trump is trying to contain </b>the blowback from the latest biofuel waivers. He convened cabinet officials and Midwestern politicians to work out a plan to satisfy farmers. On October 4 the EPA — the head of which reports directly to the president — announced a plan to maintain the small refinery waivers while also promising that more than 15bn gallons of ethanol would be blended in 2020 as mandated.</p>
      <p>Biofuels groups had been briefed in advance: the Iowa Corn Growers Association jumped the gun with a laudatory press release 17 minutes before the EPA made its announcement. Yet when <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/97e4aa48-ef8d-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">the fine print appeared</a> days later, farmers’ excitement turned to fury. “No more Iowa nice. Now it’s Iowa pissed,” said Craig Floss, chief executive of the ICGA.</p>
      <p>While the EPA said it would compensate for the biofuel volumes lost to the refinery waivers, it now wants to calculate the amount lost based on Department of Energy recommendations, which means hundreds of millions of gallons fewer biofuel sales than first promised, adding to farmers’ woes. Nor would the EPA make up the volumes lost to waivers given in earlier years.</p>
      <p>“They stood by Trump on the trade issues even though it was hurting their pocketbooks, and then got repaid with an SRE knife between their shoulder blades,” Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and a former Republican candidate for congress, told reporters.</p>

      <p>White House officials insisted that both oil and agricultural interests should be satisfied with the deal. “Once [farmers] fully understand what you’ve done here, they’ll be fine,” Sonny Perdue, Mr Trump’s agriculture secretary, told the president at a cabinet meeting in late October. At the same meeting, Mr Trump said the agreement was “going to be terrific for the small refineries”.</p>
      <p>The message has fallen flat with farmers in the run-up to a November 29 deadline for public comment on the refinery waiver proposal. At a hearing in Michigan in late October, dozens of speakers attacked the plan. “The rules have changed, and now rural America is losing,” testified Brian Duncan, a farmer from north-west Illinois.</p>
      <p>Republican lawmakers seem loath to criticise the president, instead targeting the EPA. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa senator and a four-decade long champion of the ethanol industry, responded to the October 4 announcement by praising Mr Trump for “promises made and promises kept”.</p>
      <p>He stands by those words. “EPA is not carrying out the president’s promise,” he says. “The president really is pro-ethanol. The president is really pro-farmer.”</p>
      <p>Mr Grassley accepts that Republicans could suffer at the polls if the EPA pushes through the proposal, but says that Iowans are not single-issue voters. Agricultural policy aside, he suggests they would be turned off by a wealth tax, a carbon tax and other positions promoted by some Democrats. “I think farmers are a little bit broader-based than just their own pocketbook when it comes to choosing a president,” he says.</p>
      <p>Others see support fraying ahead of the 2020 election. “The farmers still seem relatively solidly behind Trump, but a year is a long time,” says a Republican farm lobbyist in Washington. “If these guys have another year like they’ve had this year, if you see no progress on China, if you continue to see announcements for SREs out of EPA, there is going to be a breaking point.”</p>
      <p><b>The American Farm Bureau Federation</b>, the biggest agricultural lobby in the country, has a 114-page book of policies that stake out its positions on everything from insulated wiring in farm machinery — it should repel “rodents and fire ants” — to marriage, which should be “between male and female”. Mr Trump spoke at its 100th annual convention last January, telling the conservative-leaning body: “On every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers.”</p>
      <p>The small refinery exemptions “really got farmers upset”, says Andrew Walmsley, AFBF director of congressional relations. “I believe there’s a real good chance of political ramifications. I don’t know what that looks like, but there is angst in parts of this country.”</p>
      <p>The 40,000-member National Corn Growers Association has tended to donate more to Republicans than Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But some members of the group are having doubts about the president<b>.</b> Bob Bowman, a former NCGA board member from eastern Iowa, says he voted for Mr Trump in 2016. He agrees with the White House on the need to confront China on issues including erratic standards for importing US farm goods.</p>

      <p>But after Mr Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and exempted more oil refineries, he is undecided about 2020. “I don’t know if people are going to vote for someone else. I think they may stay home and not vote [at all]. That’s what I’m hearing from the countryside,” he says.</p>
      <p>Among the tidy farms of north-west Iowa, signs painted with prayers and anti-abortion slogans are interspersed with seed company ads. Tim Allen, Sioux County Republican chairman, says social issues motivate his voters more than economic ones. His main goal for 2020 was simply to get enough Republicans to the polls to offset any Democratic gains elsewhere in the state. The last Democrat the county voted to be president was Franklin D Roosevelt.</p>
      <p>“I think there are a lot of people who are not happy with him,” he says of the president. “But I don’t get the sense that this is going to turn them off voting for Trump, especially over a Democrat who’s going to be pro-choice and pro-gay marriage and those things.”</p>
      <p>Democrats are trying. Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, candidates seeking the party’s Democratic presidential nomination, both visited Sioux County this month.</p>
      <p>A few miles from Siouxland Energy a group of liberal activists gathered in the backroom of a café to debate strategies to attract rural voters. Addressing the meeting was JD Scholten, a Democrat running for Congress in Iowa’s fourth district, who believes the waivers have changed the voting calculation of many.</p>
      <p>“The RFS [Renewable Fuel Standard] is just straight-up being abused,” Mr Scholten says. “Some folks who were a year ago with Trump or six months ago with Trump, ever since August 9, they’ve left the door open.”</p>
      <h3>Technology: electric vehicles pose threat to biofuel expansion</h3>
      <p>It is not just changes in renewable fuels policy that threaten US farm groups. Electric vehicles could also make their life more difficult, chipping away at sales not only of oil but also the corn ethanol blended with most of the petrol used in cars.</p>
      <p>Analysts project that EVs could account for as much as 60 per cent of the global auto fleet by 2040, according to a survey published last year by Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.</p>
      <p>The US trails most other regions, but some politicians are trying to hasten the switch. Chuck Schumer, US Senate minority leader, last month unveiled a $454bn, 10-year plan to shift a quarter of the nation’s car fleet to EVs and other cleaner vehicles.</p>
      <p>“I think we’re threatened by a changing world, and we better get united,” John Shimkus, a Republican congressman, said at a recent hearing on biofuels. His central Illinois region contains grain farms and oil refineries.</p>
      <p>Fuel economy has weighed on biofuel growth. US petrol consumption has barely changed since the 2007 Renewable Fuel Standard despite record highway travel. Ethanol levels are capped at 10 per cent of most petrol blends, leaving it dependent on overall fuel demand.</p>
      <p>Trump administration efforts to abandon planned higher standards for fuel economy have sparked litigation from California and other states. But biofuels lobbies have not objected to the rulemaking, arguing it is an opportunity to add more octane to petrol and in turn increase sales of octane-rich ethanol.</p>
