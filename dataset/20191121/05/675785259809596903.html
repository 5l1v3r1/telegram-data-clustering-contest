      <p>Queen frontman <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/freddie-mercury">Freddie Mercury</a> spent his final days surrounded by his loved ones on continuous 12-hour shifts before he died from Aids at the age of 45 in November 1991.</p>
      <p>His close friend and personal assistant Peter Freestone has spoken out about being by the iconic rockstar's side during the emotional tragedy and revealed how Freddie had one final act to fulfill before facing the end.</p>
      <p>After living with the ill-stricken star at his Kensington pad from 1978 to 1991, Peter described the importance of Freddie's final act on his deathbed to <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/1207148/Freddie-Mercury-death-interview-Queen-band-music-fans-home-AIDS-die">Express Online</a> and explained how it gave him "peace" and allowed him to "finally let go" in those last moments.</p>

      <p>Peter said: "For the last week he never left his bed and he was never alone. We did twelve hour shifts. I would sit on the bed holding his hand so if he woke up someone was there.</p>
      <p>"The last time I saw him was on the Friday night, November 22."</p>
      <p>According to Peter, The Queen star made a huge decision that evening to tell the world the truth about his health and cause of his imminent death.</p>
      <p>After keeping his battle with Aids a secret for years, the singer called his manager and friend Jim Beach and together they agreed on the public statement confirming the news.</p>

      <p>Peter continued: "Contrary to belief, he did not release the statement about his status the day before he died. It was released at 8pm on the Friday night but the papers ran it on the Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>"I have never seen him so relaxed because the secret was out. There was nothing to hide or worry about. So he could prepare himself. It was such a huge relief to just let it out."</p>
      <p>Around 24 hours hours later, Freddie died and Peter believed that "Freddie had decided he had had enough" and thinks his friend was ready to "go under his own terms."</p>
      <p>The frontman succumbed to his battle with Aids on November 24, having released the public statement just 24 hours previously that confirmed he was HIV+.</p>

      <p>Freddie died with his close friend Dave Clark - lead singer of the Dave Clark Five - by his side.</p>
      <p>Rumours had been swirling about his health status for a number of years, with speculation that he had been tested for HIV and Aids as far back as 1986, after his health declined so rapidly that Queen had to halt their 1987 Magic Tour before it was due to finish.</p>
      <p>Tragically, Freddie knew the haunting end was coming as his body was breaking down even while he still found the strength to record his lasting lyrics.</p>
      <p>He had lost most of his left foot to the cruel disease, showing what remained to his bandmates over one dinner then apologising for upsetting them.</p>

      <p>The secret about Freddie's fate and his illness was also hidden from his close friend and fellow legend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/elton-john">Elton John</a> .</p>
      <p>The Candle In The Wind hitmaker, 72, reflects on visiting the rockstar, in his book Me: Elton John, and while Freddie never told him he was dying, Elton writes about the frontman "losing his sight and his body being covered in Kaposi's sarcoma lesions."</p>
      <p>He also penned that he didn't think Freddie "wanted me to see him like that", but later describes his friendship with the global sensation and admits how the star helped him face his troubling drug addiction.</p>
      <p>Adam Lambert now fills the legend's sizeable shoes when he tours with Queen.</p>
      <p>However, the American previously said Freddie is "irreplaceable" but says it's an honour to represent him on stage.</p>
