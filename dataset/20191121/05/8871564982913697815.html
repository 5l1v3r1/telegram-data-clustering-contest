      <h1>Singapore megachurch to buy entire Star Vista for S$296M</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:12:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>A Singaporean megachurch is set to buy The Star Vista shopping mall at a whopping S$296 million (US$217 million), it announced yesterday. </p>
      <p>Rock Productions, the business arm of the New Creation Church, which already owns the mall’s 5,000-seat auditorium where it has held services for seven years, will purchase the rest of the property from mall developer and owner CapitaLand to keep it out of other hands.</p>
      <p>Buying the whole mall will save the church from any unforeseen developments that may come if purchased by another buyer, the church told reporters yesterday. </p>
      <p>Selling the mall was part of CapitaLand’s asset divestment plan, the proceeds of which will be used for other acquisitions, according to a company <a href="https://www.capitaland.com/international/en/about-capitaland/newsroom/news-releases/international/2019/nov/CapitaLand-divests-The-Star-Vista.html">statement</a>. The sale is set to take place at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“The divestment of The Star Vista is in line with CapitaLand’s active and disciplined asset recycling strategy … The proceeds from these divestments will enhance CapitaLand’s financial flexibility to seize new growth opportunities,” said Jason Leow, the group’s domestic and international president.</p>
      <p>New Creation is a non-denominational Christian church led by senior pastor Joseph Prince.</p>
      <p>Located near the Buona Vista MRT Interchange, Star Vista opened in 2012 with over 24,000sqm of retail space.</p>
      <p>That’s when New Creation started holding services in the mall’s Star Performing Arts Center, or Star PAC. The church bought it outright for S$500 million, an amount much higher than the value of the entire mall. </p>
      <p>“Given that The Star Vista and The Star PAC are inextricably linked, our immediate objective … is both to protect the interest of the church and to preserve the good experience for all who come to The Star [Performing Arts Center],” Deacon Yong Chee Ram told <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-creation-church-buys-the-star-vista-mall-for-296m"><i>The Straits Times</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The church, fronted by popular senior pastor Prince, opened in 1983 with services held at a Holland Drive flat. Its main weekly services are held at the Star PAC, while it hosts Chinese services in a Marina Bay Sands ballroom, along with other satellite venues, <a href="https://www.newcreation.org.sg/">the church’s website says</a>. </p>
      <p>Many Singaporeans have been skeptical about businesses tied to megachurches ever since the City Harvest megachurch made headlines for misappropriating church funds to pursue a pastor’s music career. </p>
      <p>Pastor Kong Hee, husband of <i>China Wine</i> singer and pastor Sun Ho, was <a href="https://coconuts.co/singapore/news/embezzling-city-harvest-church-founder-kong-hee-released-from-prison/">released from prison</a> a year early in August after serving just over two years behind bars, made possible by an <a href="https://www.sps.gov.sg/volunteer/conditional-remission-system-and-mandatory-aftercare-scheme">early release program</a>.</p>
