      <p>A video of a battle between a leopard and a porcupine has surfaced on social media and it will give you goose bumps. The 58-second clip has been shared on Twitter by Parveen Kaswan of the Indian Forest Service and is swiftly going viral.</p>
      <p>On a highway amid the grasslands, the leopard and porcupine engaged in a deadly battle. The big cat, however, should have known that messing with a porcupine is not quite a good idea. As it scratched the porcupine, it moved ahead and so did the big cat. The leopard, enraged, bit the porcupine. And there you go.</p>
      <p>Guess who had the last laugh. The leopard hurt its mouth with the sharp spines of the porcupine, also known as quills, and struggled in pain. It, thereafter, walked past the porcupine into the grasslands and did not even dare to look at it again.</p>
      <p>This is an old video, as per Parveen Kaswan as he said in his caption, "Continuing with #leopard vs #porcupine. This one old video of another encounter between them. Here leopard got a good lesson from porcupine With their sharp quills."</p>
