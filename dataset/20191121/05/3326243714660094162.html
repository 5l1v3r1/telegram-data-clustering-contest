      <p>Have a favorite iOS widget, but wish you could see it directly from the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/lockscreen/">Lock screen</a> without needing to swipe over to the Today page? There’s a <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks/">jailbreak tweak</a> for that!</p>
      <p>If you answered ‘yes’ to the question above, then we’d like to introduce you to <b>LockWidgets</b>, a newly released add-on by iOS developer <i>ConorTheDev</i> that lets you pin your favorite Today widget to the primary Lock screen page so you can view it at a glance:</p>

      <p>In the screenshot example above, we’ve pinned the native <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/weather/">Weather</a> widget to our Lock screen. It appears just underneath the digital time indicator, and any missed <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/notifications/">notifications</a> you have will appear below the widget when they occur.</p>
      <p>You can pin any widget of your choosing to the Lock screen with LockWidgets, whether it’s native or a third-party offering bundled along with one of your installed apps.</p>
      <p>After you install LockWidgets, you’ll find a dedicated preference pane in the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:</p>

      <p>Here, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the tweak on or off on demand</li>
        <li>
          <p>Select a preferred widget to appear on your Lock screen:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Up Next</li>
            <li>

            <li>
              <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/photos/">Photos</a>
            </li>
            <li>Favorites</li>
            <li>Maps Destinations</li>
            <li>Calendar</li>
            <li>Stocks</li>
            <li>Maps Nearby</li>
            <li>Reminders</li>
            <li>Weather</li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/battery/">Batteries</a>
            </li>
            <li>Any third-party application widget you might have installed</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The developer provides a Respring button that you’ll want to tap any time you swap widgets. This ensures saved changes and helps with a smooth transition.</p>
      <p>The glaring question many of you might be asking right now is whether you can have several widgets on your Lock screen by way of LockWidget, and from what we can gather, this doesn’t appear to be possible as of now. Instead, you’ll have to choose your lone favorite for the time being.</p>
      <p>Those interested in trying LockWidget can <a href="https://repo.dynastic.co/package/lockwidgets">download it for free from the Dynastic Repo repository</a> in their preferred package manager. The tweak currently supports <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak/">jailbroken</a> iOS 11, 12, and 13 devices, and its source code <a href="https://github.com/ConorTheDev/LockWidgets">is available on the developer’s GitHub page</a> for those interested in learning more about what makes it tick.</p>
