      <p>After Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is in process of registering a money laundering case against Amnesty International (India) and its related entities, sources said.</p>
      <p>The move comes after CBI registered an FIR against the Human Rights watchdog for allegedly violating FCRA norms and FDI norms. Sources said the ED is going through the documents and will soon register an ECIR against the entities of Amnesty International.</p>
      <p>The CBI registered an FIR against the entities of Amnesty India on November 5 after receiving a complaint from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and a report from Enforcement Directorate. The CBI carried out searches at four locations of the human rights group Amnesty India's offices in Bengaluru and Delhi after filing the FIR.</p>
      <p>"It has been alleged that the said entities received foreign contributions amounting to Rs 36 crore (approx) from M/s Amnesty International UK through AIIPL. It was also alleged that M/s Amnesty International (UK) invested Rs 10 crore (approx) as FDI in M/s Amnesty International India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore by subscribing to the Debentures," CBI sources had said.</p>
      <p>The complaint by the MHA claims that Amnesty India used commercial methods in order to illegally circumvent the provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) that they were obliged to observe.</p>
      <p>The source said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in its order had said that in order to evade FCRA, Amnesty (UK) remitted Rs 10 crore to Amnesty's India entities classified as FDI, without its approval.</p>
      <p>Sources claimed that the inspection of Books of Accounts of M/s Amnesty International India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore by MHA revealed that the company allegedly indulged in activities "that were not commensurate to the activities of a for-profit company but constituted activities that are either prohibited or regulated under FCRA."</p>
      <p>India Today TV has learnt the CBI has asked Amnesty to explain the nature of the transaction.</p>
      <p>Amnesty in a statement said: "Over the past year, a pattern of harassment has emerged every time Amnesty International India stands up and speaks out against human rights violations in India. Amnesty International India stands in full compliance with Indian and international law."</p>
