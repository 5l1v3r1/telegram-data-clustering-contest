      <p>Victor Osimhen seems to be the first casualty of Jose Mourinho’s ascension in the dugout at EPL dark horse, Tottenham Hotspur, Sports Extra reports.</p>
      <p>The Special One, as he is fondly called, was appointed as the new Lilywhites manager after Argentine, Mauricio Pochettino, was booted out for poor results on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>And Mourinho, whose last job was with Manchester United, approximately 11 months ago, is eager to construct his backroom staff, and turned to Lille, poaching Osimhen’s coach, Joao Sacramento.</p>
      <p>Sacramento, is an assistant to Les Dogues’ manager, Christian Galtier.</p>
      <p>He was appointed in 2017 as an assistant to Galtier, helping the 20-year-old to settle in well at the Stade Pierre-Murroy following his €12m switch this season.</p>
      <p>The Nigeria international won the Club’s Player of the Month for October after scoring nine goals in all competitions so far this season.</p>
