      <h2>From today, we will include capsules of the weather forecast for key cities across Tamil Nadu; Chennaites, expect it to be cloudy with a chance of... light rain</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:39:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:39</time> by <a rel="author">Vinson Kurian</a></address>
      <p>The day after the North-East monsoon delivered some telling blows to Chennai, its immediate neighbourhood, and parts of rest of Tamil Nadu, a status update at 9.20 am this Thursday tells a different story.</p>
      <p>After a couple of showers in the neighbourhood early in the morning, thunderstorms roared past to the North-West and West of Chennai and kept moving to the South-West. After a lighter outing over Vallur, Vichoor, and Padiyanallur the rains got heavier as they ventured into Ambattur, Ramapuram, Thandalam, Thirumazhisai, Mevallurkuppam, and significantly heavy further South-West.</p>
      <p>The areas battered here included Sriperumbudur, Sunguvarchatram, Pannur, Neervallur, Murungai, Tirumalpur, Thakkolam and Perumuchi before the thunderstorms paraded further into the interior. This is even as some potent thunderstorms hung about out at sea to the South-East of Chennai awaiting winds to carry them towards the coast.</p>
      <h3>Chennai International Airport (MAA/VOMM)</h3>
      <p>Overcast/thunderstorm/drizzle with winds south-westerly at 11 km/hr and temperature 24 degrees Celsius at 8 am. Current disruptions: average delay of three minutes in arrivals (increasing tendency); 10 minutes in departures (reducing tendency). Abu Dhabi-Chennai Etihad Airways and Dubai-Chennai Emirates aircraft approaching for landing from the North-West and Colombo-Chennai Srilankan Airlines flight from the South-West. A number of domestic flights were also in various stages of operation in and around the airport.</p>
      <p>The Weather Company, an IBM Business, says that the North-East monsoon will provide intermittent rains punctuated by thunderstorms, mainly over Tamil Nadu, Kerala, South Andhra Pradesh, and South Karnataka today. Active thunderstorms may develop off the coast of Kerala and around Lakshadweep.</p>
      <p>The temperature will remain between between 27 and 30 degrees Celsius today with predominantly north-easterly winds in Chennai city, says the Chennai Met Office of the India Meteorological Department. It will be mainly cloudy, with light rain expected at some areas. Thunderstorms with lightning are likely to occur at isolated places over Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>A battle between the Sun and the clouds will pray out through the day with brief showers says international forecaster AccuWeather. The temperature may peak to 31 degrees Celsius (real feel of 36 degrees Celsius) before dipping to a low of 24 degrees Celsius during a partly cloudy night marked by a passing shower or two.</p>
