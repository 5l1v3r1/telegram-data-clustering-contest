      <p>Myanmar State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will lead the effort at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to defend Myanmar’s national interest, according to a statement by Myanmar State Counsellor Office, on November 20.</p>
      <p>On behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Gambia has submitted an application to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) with regard to the displaced persons from the Rakhine State. Under the Charter of the United Nations, all members of the United Nations, including Myanmar are bound by the statue of the ICJ, the statement says.</p>
      <p>Myanmar has retained prominent international lawyers to contest the case submitted by Gambia. The State Counsellor, in her capacity as Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, will lead a team to the Hague, Netherlands, to defend the national interest of Myanmar at the ICJ.</p>
      <p>UN mechanisms and human rights activists who are working with the support of the OIC, are putting pressure on Myanmar regularly. Gambia filed a lawsuit against Myanmar at the ICJ on November 11.</p>
      <p>The accusation is that Tatmadaw’s actions against Bengali in Rakhine State amounts to breaching the 1948 Genocide Convention. The court said on November 18, it would hold public hearings in December.</p>
      <p>On November 13, Bengali organizations based in the UK, also filed the lawsuit against Myanmar State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, current president U Win Myint, Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, former president U Thein Sein and former president U Htin Kyaw, in Argentina.</p>
