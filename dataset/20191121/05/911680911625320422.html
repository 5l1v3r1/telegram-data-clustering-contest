      <p>SCOTTSDALE, AZ â€” Police in Scottsdale say a man and woman have been arrested on suspicion of felony counts of armed robbery and organized retail theft.</p>
      <p>They say 31-year-old Epitacio Cortina Jr. and 32-year-old Crystal Nichole Roberto are accused of shoplifting several power tools from a Home Depot store in Scottsdale last month.</p>
      <p>Police say they received numerous tips that led investigators to identify Cortina and Roberto as suspects in the case.</p>
      <p>They say the couple was confronted by store employees in the Oct. 13 shoplifting incident. The employees told police the male suspect displayed a handgun and fled the store with the female suspect and the stolen items.</p>
      <p>Police say the two drove off in a car that was later recovered and determined to have been stolen prior to the store robbery.</p>
