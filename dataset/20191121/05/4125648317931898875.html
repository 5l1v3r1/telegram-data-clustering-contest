      <p>BEIRUT, LEBANON (9:00 A.M.) – On Wednesday morning, the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) launched an attack to capture a town in the southeastern countryside of the Idlib Governorate.</p>
      <p>Led by the 25th Special Mission Forces (formerly Tiger Forces), the Syrian Arab Army began their attack by storming Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham’s positions at the town of Musharifah Al-Shmaliyah.</p>
      <p>Following a short battle, the Syrian Arab Army was able to establish full control over Musharifah Shmaliyah, forcing the jihadist rebels to withdraw further west in Idlib.</p>
      <p>However, shortly after their withdrawal, the jihadist rebels launched a swift counter-offensive to retake the town from the Syrian Arab Army.</p>
      <p>Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham managed to reenter Musharifah Al-Shmaliyah after pushing the Syrian Army back to the western part of the town; however, this counter-attack would be short-lived as they were unable to crack the Syrian military’s main line of defense.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday evening, the Syrian Army was able to establish full control over the entire town while securing all of the points they seized from the jihadist rebels.</p>
      <p>The Syrian Arab Army has since moved their forces to the western axis of Musharifah Al-Shmaliyah, as they prepare to launch another attack on the jihadist rebel defenses.</p>
