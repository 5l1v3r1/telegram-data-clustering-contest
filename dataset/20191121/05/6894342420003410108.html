      <h1>HONOR 9X Officially Lands In Malaysia; Retails For RM999</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:30:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/john/" target="_blank">John Law</a></address>
      <p>Nearly <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/190314/honor-9x-and-9x-pro-now-official-features-kirin-810-soc-48mp-main-camera/">half a year</a> after it was announced, and as per <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198759/honor-9x-launch-malaysia-21-november/">our earlier report</a>, the HONOR 9X finally coming to our shores. The phone was first made official back in July this year, but was only available in China at the time.</p>
      <p>To recap on its hardware, the HONOR 9X comes with 6GB RAM, 128GB of expandable storage (up to 512GB), as well as a large 6.59-inch Full HD+ FullView display. As for the chipset underneath the hood, we’re looking at a Kirin 710 SoC and not the Kirin 810 SoC that it was initially supposed to run with.</p>
      <p>The decision to dumb down to a chipset released a generation ago is not without a valid reason. By doing this, the HONOR 9X is able to ship out with Google Mobile Service (GMS) pre-installed, sparing potential owners the feeling of owning a phone without a service that has affected <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/194838/huawei-confirms-mate-30-and-mate-30-pro-wont-officially-ship-out-with-google-mobile-services/">Huawei and its Mate 30 series</a>.</p>

      <p>Moving on, the main camera of the HONOR 9X is a triple-camera array and comprises a 48MP sensor, an 8MP ultrawide, and a 2MP depth sensor. Like its predecessor, the camera also has access to the AI Mode. Around the front, HONOR has opted to use a motorised pop-up selfie camera, complete with a 16MP sensor.</p>
      <p>As mentioned, the HONOR 9X will be available for purchase from 29 November onwards, and will retail for RM999. Preorders are set to take place between 22 November and 28 November. On that note, consumers may place their orders for the phone either via the brand’s official HiHonor page or its official store page at Lazada and Shopee.</p>

      <p>For an additional RM0.99 to your pre-order, customers will be able to choose between a pair of HONOR Sport PRO headphones or an HONOR Band 5 Sport and a mystery gift box while stocks last. Bear in mind, though, that this offer will only be in effect between 22 November and 27 November.</p>
      <p>You can still be the owner of the headphones and smart wearable if you preorder the HONOR 9X on 28 November, but instead of RM0.99, you’ll have to fork out RM199. Mind you, this offer will only be valid until 1 December 2019, at which point, the phone will already be available for purchase at all official HONOR stores nationwide.</p>
