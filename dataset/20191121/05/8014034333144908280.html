      <p>The U.S. Catholic Church pushed what it called a key reform to address its exploding clergy sex abuse scandal almost two decades ago: Mandatory review boards with lay people in each diocese to review the claims of victims fairly and kindly.</p>
      <p>But It often hasn’t worked that way, an Associated Press investigation has found. Instead, boards appointed by bishops and operating in secrecy have routinely served as a way to undermine the claims of sexual abuse from victims, avoid payouts and shield pedophile priests — ultimately raising the question of whether the church is able to reform itself on its own.</p>
      <p>The AP investigation found:</p>
      <p>— Across the country, bishops have masked these boards in secrecy, often hiding who serves on them and how they handle cases.</p>
      <p>— Bishops appoint the very people supposed to defend abuse victims, and have sometimes put church defence attorneys and top aides on boards.</p>
      <p>— A few clergy who later accused of sexual misconduct were themselves board members.</p>
      <p>— Bishops choose the cases and evidence going before boards, and in some cases even board members were not told about abuse or lied to.</p>
      <p>— Even when a review board affirms a victim’s case, some bishops have overruled them.</p>
      <p>— In dozens of cases, secular courts or government investigators later decided abuse was credible after boards had said it was not.</p>
