      <p>Age of Empires 4 has been solely announced for PC but the game’s creative director doesn’t rule out a console version.</p>
      <p>Officially announced for PC back in August of 2017, Age of Empires 4 has yet to receive a release date. New gameplay footage from the RTS was shown during Microsoft’s X019 event last week, and creative director Adam Isgreen confirmed that that <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-iv-no-microtransactions/">the game won’t be getting microtransactions</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“The idea of microtransactions in a real-time strategy game isn’t a thing”, he said. “DLC, expansions – all of that is things that we’re going to be exploring for Age 4.”</p>
      <p>In a new interview with Australian website Stevivor, Isgreen and General Xbox Manager Shannon Loftis were asked about a console version of Age 4, and while they didn’t directly confirm it, the duo didn’t rule out the possibility of the RTS coming to Xbox as well.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard, as a PC game,” Loftis <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/age-of-empires-4-console-release-hasnt-been-ruled-out/">told</a> Stevivor. “We want to make it great on PC. But then, I think the whole concept of platform is about to change with Xbox.”</p>
      <p>“We are working hard to make sure to visualize all the different ways that people are going to want to experience Age [of Empires]. But our number one priority is to make it work great with keyboard and mouse.”</p>
      <p>Creative director Isgreen added that they will be exploring their options for Age 4. “We’re going to explore our options,” he replied when asked about a console version. “Once we have our wonderful PC game, then we’ll start looking at other ways that we can show up.”</p>
      <p>Developed by Relic Entertainment, Age of Empires 4 is still in its pre-alpha state, but be sure to check out the new gameplay footage from X019 down below:</p>
