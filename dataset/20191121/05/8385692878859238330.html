      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/oneplus">OnePlus</a> 3 and OnePlus 3T have <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-9-0-6-for-oneplus-3-oneplus-3t.1142865/">started receiving</a> their final security update via OxygenOS 9.0.6. Needless to say, this will be the last update OnePlus pushes out to the two devices, as they've reached the end of their update cycle.</p>
      <p>Both of these devices have launched back in 2016, and the company has been updating them ever since. The OnePlus 3 devices have started receiving the Android security update for October 2019, and that will be the very last update they will get.</p>
      <h3>OnePlus fulfilled its promise, it has been updating these devices for 2.5 years</h3>
      <p>The company has fulfilled its promise, and has been updating the two phones for two years. We're talking about regular updates here, updates with new features, Android version upgrades, and security patch bi-monthly updates.</p>

      <p>In addition to those two years of promised regular updates, the company also promised an extra year of security updates for the OnePlus 3 and 3T. Well, that promise has also been fulfilled with this latest update.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Android security patch for October 2019, this update also brings some bug fixes and improvements. OnePlus wanted to make sure the two phones continue working properly, as they probably won't get any additional updates.</p>
      <h3>The final update for the OnePlus 3 series also updates GMS apps</h3>
      <p>On top of that, OnePlus also updated GMS apps on both devices, just to make sure they're up to the task from this point on. Both of these devices are currently running on Android 9 Pie.</p>

      <p>The OnePlus 3 and 3T may have been released back in 2016, but both devices still offer really good performance. This latest update should only make sure it stays that way for the foreseeable future, in case you're not planning to upgrade yet.</p>
      <p>OnePlus has been releasing quite a few updates lately, both stable and beta ones. The latest one arrived for the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro earlier today. The company released OxygenOS Open Beta 6 for the two devices.</p>
      <p>Two days ago, OxygenOS 10.0.2 arrived for the two devices, while the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro got updated several days ago as well.</p>

      <p>The OnePlus 7 and 7T series of smartphones is still considered new, as all those devices launched this year. The 7T series is newer, of course, but is very similar in terms of specs to the OnePlus 7 series.</p>
      <p>All those devices will continue receiving updates for quite some time, and you can expect to see new features being added on in time.</p>
      <p>The OnePlus 6 and 6T users are waiting on the Android 10 update as we speak. OnePlus started pushing out that update a while back, but some bugs were discovered, so the rollout was stopped. The company is working on a brand new build that is expected to arrive soon.</p>
