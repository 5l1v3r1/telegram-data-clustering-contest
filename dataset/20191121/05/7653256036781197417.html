      <p><i>The entire oil marketing company space is going to rerate because of the event and better marketing margins and the possibility of unlocking of value from here on, says <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Hemang-Jani">Hemang Jani</a></b>, Senior Vice President, <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sharekhan">Sharekhan</a></b>. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.<br/></i><br/><b>What had been an indication, has become an intention. The government has made an official announcement of plans to sell stake in SCI, Concor and BPCL. But can they do it before 31st of March 2020?<br/></b>We finally have an official decision. In-principle approval definitely paves the way for the entire process to begin and yes the overall complexity of the deal and the due diligence and other processes have to be done. It may take a bit more time depending on what kind of interest one is really seeing for BPCL, Concor etc. but the market has already said that the government is sincere about divesting. As far as BPCL is concerned, it is both the entire stake and the management control. Given its strategic nature and the fact that the environment for oil marketing companies is extremely positive at this point of time, means there is scope for a good amount of interest and rerating for the entire sector.</p>
      <p>You might see a bit of delay in the actual process and the government getting the money, but the market is definitely sensing that and the entire oil marketing company space is going to rerate because of the event and better marketing margins and the possibility of unlocking of value from here on..</p>
