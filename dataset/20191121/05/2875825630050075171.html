      <h1>Man Utd 'consider Edin Dzeko transfer' as Mario Mandzukic alternative</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United are reportedly weighing up bid for former Manchester City hitman Dzeko in January transfer window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:55:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:55</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are reportedly weighing up a shock January move for former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> striker Edin Dezko as an alternative to Mario Mandzukic.</p>
      <p>United's top priority in the January transfer window is a striker, after the Red Devils let Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez leave in the summer without signing replacements.</p>
      <p>The failure to bring in a new striker over the summer came back to haunt <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> when both Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial were injured earlier in the summer, leaving 22-year-old summer signing Daniel James and teenager Mason Greenwood as the main attacking options.</p>
      <p>Out-of-favour <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> striker Mario Mandzukic has been heavily linked with a January move to solve United's goalscoring problems, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side having scored just 16 times in 12 Premier League games so far this season.</p>
      <p>But interest in the Croatian striker has cooled due to his lack of involvement at Juve, according to <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/soccer-transfers/story/3994517/sources-manchester-united-target-former-city-striker-edin-dzeko">ESPN</a> .</p>

      <p>And the outlet reports that Roma striker Dzeko is now United's main target, despite being 33.</p>
      <p>Dzeko scored 72 goals in 189 appearances for Manchester City between 2011 and 2016.</p>
      <p>He scored two in the 6-1 Manchester derby win at Old Trafford which helped spur City on to a title triumph against their neighbours.</p>
      <p>And Dzeko also scored a crucial equaliser in City's final game of that season - a 3-2 win at home to QPR in which two last-ditch goals finally swung the title away from United.</p>

      <p>Since leaving City, Dzeko has scored 93 goals in 194 games for Roma, including 39 in the 2016-17 season.</p>
      <p>United's executive-vice chairman Ed Woodward has been wary of signing players over the age of 30.</p>
      <p>But it is thought the youthful nature of United's other attacking options could convince Red Devils chiefs to see past Dzeko's age and bank on his experience.</p>
      <p>He is contracted to Roma until 2022 and is valued at around Â£13million.</p>
