      <p>A young motorcyclist died as a result of a high-speed collision with the back of lorry <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/alvaston">near Alvaston</a>.</p>
      <p>Jack Gray, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/chaddesden">from Chaddesden</a>, hit the back of a large waste disposal vehicle during a miscalculated attempt to overtake it on the A6 Alvaston bypass, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/inquests">an inquest into his death heard</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Gray, 22, who worked as a maintenance engineer, was flown by air ambulance to Queen's Medical Centre, in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>Sadly, medics there were unable to save his life and he died from his injuries on October 11, 2018.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem examination by pathologist Dr Amandeep Mann found Mr Gray died as a result of a severe head injury caused by a road traffic collision.</p>
      <p>A toxicology report found no drugs or alcohol in his system.</p>
      <p>The lorry driver had indicated he was going to overtake a slower moving vehicle in front of him.</p>
      <p>He told Derby Coroner's Court: "I was travelling down the A6 bypass, I checked my mirrors, indicated, checked my mirrors again and started to move into lane two.</p>
      <p>"There was an almighty bang, loads of smoke and dust. I thought I'd had a blowout. A few moments later I realised what happened and brought my vehicle to a stop."</p>

      <p>The 32-tonne tipper has a fixed maximum speed of 56mph, and the driver said he was travelling at a speed of between 50mph and 56 mph.</p>
      <p>He added: "Driving an HGV, I'm always cautious. We are always taught on courses to watch out for bikes, motorbikes and stuff.</p>
      <p>"I can't recall seeing a motorbike. There were no dangers to make me think I shouldn't make the manoeuver."</p>
      <p>After he brought the lorry to a stop, the driver said the back light was "completely smashed against he chassis" and the vehicle had suffered "extensive damage".</p>
      <p>He remained at the scene and made a statement to Derbyshire Roads Policing Unit officers.</p>
      <p>He told the inquest: "It's just an unfortunate accident, its played on my mind, obviously. I'm sorry for the family."</p>
      <h3>Speeds in excess of 100mph</h3>
      <p>PC Matthew Lacey told assistant coroner Louise Pinder that Mr Gray had passed between two vehicles at high speed moments before, as shown on dashcam footage supplied by a witness.</p>
      <p>He also said that neither the BMW motorbike or the lorry had any notable defects.</p>
      <p>The police officer found in his investigation that Mr Gray had been driving at an average speed of 95 mph and had driven at over 100 mph at some points.</p>
      <p>He said: "Due to the speed the motorbike was travelling, it covered the distance in a short time. He was unable to move out of the way, he attempted to brake but hit the back of the large goods vehicle.</p>
      <p>"It's clear from the dashcam footage that the BMW motorcycle has accelerated hard along the carriageway. I'm confident that his speed was in excess of 100 mph at some point.</p>
      <p>"It may be that Jack believed he was carrying enough speed to get past it before its manoeuver."</p>
      <h3>He tried to brake...</h3>
      <p>Another witness, who attended the inquest, said: "I saw the bike in my wing mirror, I was probably doing about 50-55 mph.</p>
      <p>"The bike came past me like I was stood still. He was going over 100mph, 110mph I'd say. He was accelerating up, I noticed the lorry had started to indicate before he (Mr Gray) came past me.</p>
      <p>"He came past and had the accelerator pinned flat out. He hesitated for a second but went because he thought he could make the gap, in my opinion.</p>
      <p>"Must have been about 20 yards before he realised there wasn't a gap there and tried to brake.</p>
      <p>"The lorry was already indicating to move over because if he'd have looked in his mirror I'd have been the only one there, probably about 200 yards back. He wouldn't have seen him (Mr Gray).</p>
      <p>"Once he (Mr Gray) tried to brake there was nothing he could do, it was like trying to get through a closing door."</p>
      <h3>The family are devastated</h3>
      <p>Assistant coroner Louise Pinder concluded that Mr Gray's death was the result of a road traffic collision.</p>
      <p>She also said: "The LGV involved in this collision was being driven perfectly appropriately.</p>
      <p>"The driver of the LGV did not at any time see Jack.</p>
      <p>"I find that Jack was moving at 95 mph, It is likely that Jack then made a split second calculation that there was sufficient time and space.</p>
      <p>"His calculation we know of course is now wrong."</p>
      <p>Ms Pinder also said that Jack had a special interest in motorbikes and maintained his bike to a high standard and that he was a "competent and experienced" driver.</p>
      <p>At the time of his death, Mr Gray's family released a statement that said: "We, as a family, are more than devastated".</p>
