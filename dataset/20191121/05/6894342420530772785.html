      <h1>Leica SL2 Launches In Malaysia; Priced At RM28200 For Body Only</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/heirul/" target="_blank">Heirul Kamel</a></address>
      <p>Following its previous unveiling a while back, the new <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198406/leica-announces-sl2-mirrorless-features-47mp-full-frame-sensor-and-4k-60-fps-video-recording/">Leica SL2</a> camera has officially launched in Malaysia today. The SL2 is latest mirrorless camera released in 2019 after the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/179773/leica-q2-camera-malaysia-price/">Leica Q2’s launch back in March</a>.</p>
      <p>To recap, the SL2 offers a 47.3MP full-frame CMOS sensor that features the new ‘sensor-shift’ image stabilisation technology and an ISO range of up to 50000. Powering the sensor and its ‘sensor-shift’ tech is an improved Maestro III processor, which allows for zero shutter lag in between shots and a very responsive autofocus, even in lowlight. The faster shutter also enables the Leica SL2’s new multi-shot mode which allows continuous shooting that combines into an ultra high-resolution photo of up to 187MP.</p>
      <p>The camera could capture 5K videos at 30fps, 4K at up to 60fps and 1080p at up to 180fps, while also allowing 2x and 6x slow motion recording for the two latter resolutions. For both still and video modes, the SL2 features several filters which includes Standard, Vivid, Natural, Monochrome, and Monochrome High Contrast.</p>

      <p>The camera’s L-mount is compatible with a wide variety of Leica L lenses, as well as L-Mount Alliance lenses from Sigma and Panasonic. Furthermore, M lenses are also supported by using the M-Adapter L with camera.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the SL2 sports an ergonomic magnesium alloy body which is also weather-proof with a certified IP rating of 54, a 3.2-inch LCD touchscreen display, a 5.76MP EyeRes EVF, and wireless connectivity via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.</p>
      <p>The new Leica SL2 is priced at RM28200 for body only, and is available now at the official Leica Store in Avenue K and all authorised Leica dealers in Malaysia.</p>
