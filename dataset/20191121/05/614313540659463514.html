      <h1>Matthew McConaughey Has Helped Design an Australian Eco-Friendly Tiny Cabin</h1>
      <h2>You’ll Soon Be Able to Rent a Matthew McConaughey-Designed Eco-Cabin</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.askmen.com/authors/matt_shea" target="_blank">Matt Shea</a></address>
      <p>When Academy Award-winning actor Matthew McConaughey isn’t <a href="https://www.askmen.com/news/entertainment/matthew-mcconaughey-is-now-teaching-film-at-the-university-of-texas.html">teaching film at the University of Texas</a> or <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/matthew-mcconaughey-austin-fc-new-owner/">owning soccer teams</a> or just generally being alright-alright-alright at making movies, it turns out he’s designing eco-cabins in Australia.</p>
      <p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href="https://www.askmen.com/news/home_auto/man-turns-shipping-container-into-tiny-house-for-less-than-15-000.html">A Guy Says Living in His Tiny House Is a ‘Wonderful Change’ to His Life</a></p>
      <p>On November 20, McConaughey launched The Reserve, a Wild Turkey-sponsored collaboration between the actor and Australian twin brothers Chris and Cam Grant of the Australian tiny-home start-up, <a href="https://www.unyoked.co/melbourne/">Unyoked</a>.</p>
      <p>The launch took place outside the Sydney Opera House, but come December this solar-powered tiny tot of a cabin will be on the New South Wales central coast, north of Sydney, and available to rent for as little as $150.</p>
      <p>That’s a pretty sweet price, particularly when you take into account some of the nifty features.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>NO WI-FI, NO WORRIES</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>You read that correctly — you’ll have to tether your internet in this humble abode (not that you’ll necessarily be able to get any bars on the New South Wales central coast, to be honest).</p>
      <p>But the point of The Reserve is to disconnect, and perhaps drink a lot of bourbon while you’re at it. To that end, McConaughey has added a minibar, no doubt stocked with Wild Turkey (for whom he’s a creative director). The 50-year-old film star has also supplied a range of vintage books and a stack of cassette tapes that can be played on the cabin’s vintage radio system.</p>
      <p>Indeed, McConaughey was involved in the whole process, from the conception right through to construction.</p>

      <p>“We're all on the same wavelength,” Chris Grant said in a media release on the project. “McConaughey was like one of the team during the whole design and build of The Reserve. He brought super creative energy and helped develop the philosophy behind the concept, while still helping people get unyoked, they'll be doing it in a distinctly McConaughey and Wild Turkey way.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve always been in awe of Australia's natural beauty,” McConaughey added. “My hope now is that The Reserve will inspire Australians to reconnect with nature as an antidote to the frenetic pace of life.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>WHAT IT’S ALL ABOUT</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>The Grant brothers’ Unyoked start-up has been a hit in Australia. The tiny cabins it rents on the web sit in the country on private land and are designed to help their occupants disconnect from the hustle and bustle of modern life.</p>
      <p>The Reserve was released as part of Wild Turkey’s ‘With Thanks’ initiative, that aims to get more people to reconnect with the natural wilderness while helping protect the environment.</p>
      <p>The Grants met McConaughey during the filming of “Talk Turkey,” Wild Turkey's global online <a href="https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/10/mcconaughey-and-wild-turkey-launch-interview-series/">series</a> that looked at individuals who “have an uncompromising conviction to do what they do.” The Grants were among just a handful of people selected to appear.</p>
      <p>A percentage of the proceeds of The Reserve — along with $1 from every bottle of McConaughey's own Wild Turkey Longbranch brand sold in November and December — will be donated to Unyoked’s charity partner, the Australian-based Foundation for National Parks &amp; Wildlife.</p>
