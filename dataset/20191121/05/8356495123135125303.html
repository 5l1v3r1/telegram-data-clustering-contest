      <p>There are more than a few players around the cricket world who wish Lea Tahuhu had stuck with her first role in the sport.</p>
      <p>She started playing the game as an eight-year-old, as a batswoman. It didn’t take long for things to change.</p>
      <p>Now the Canterbury player is arguably the fastest bowler in the women’s game worldwide, well capable of putting the wind up any batswomen who take her lightly.</p>
      <p>She’s among the leading players in the White Ferns, a key figure alongside the likes of Suzie Bates, Sophie Devine, Amelia Kerr and her partner in life, Amy Satterthwaite.</p>
      <p>And she’s also making an impact leading the pace attack of the Melbourne Renegades, who sit mid-table in the Women’s Big Bash League across the Tasman. Satterthwaite, who’s expecting their first child early next year, has been in Melbourne doing a spot of specialist coaching with the side she captained the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>Cutting to the chase, has Tahuhu’s speed ever been measured?</p>
      <p>Try 126kph, during the world T20 in the Caribbean a year ago. That’ll do nicely.</p>
      <p>You could call her the White Ferns’ Shane Bond or Lockie Ferguson. Then again, don’t.</p>
      <p>Where the former champion quick Bond and the current Black Caps speedster Ferguson have clocked up 150kph or just over – and a rare few men have been timed at 160kph - that’s hardly a fair comparison, for all sorts of physiological reasons best saved for another day.</p>
      <p>However, the mantle of the world’s fastest woman sits neatly with the 29-year-old Tahuhu.</p>

      <p>She has former England and Canterbury wicketkeeper Mandie Godliman to thank, along with the caretaker at her Linwood North primary school in Christchurch, for the route her life has taken.</p>
      <p>It was the school groundsman who first spotted a bit of early talent.</p>
      <p>"I was eight and he saw me mucking around at lunchtime,’’ Tahuhu recalls.</p>
      <p>‘"He played for the St Albans club. He had a chat with my parents and asked would my sister and I be keen on signing up? Twenty-one years later, I’m still playing for Saints.’’</p>
      <p>Godliman, who played one test and a handful of ODIs for England in the early 2000s, had moved to New Zealand and was coaching in Christchurch when Tahuhu was at Aranui High School.</p>
      <p>She was playing age group tournaments with Christchurch Metro - as a batswoman.</p>
      <p>"It wasn’t till I was 13 or 14, and had grown a little bit, that I turned up to winter training and could actually bowl a little quicker than the others,” Tahuhu says. ‘’Mandie said we should invest in this a bit and see where it goes.’’</p>
      <p>It was a significant development, not only in the future for the White Ferns but also importantly for the young teenager.</p>
      <p>"I think as a kid you just want to do everything, be involved in the game as much as you can,” says Tahuhu.</p>
      <p>"Once I realised I had a little more pace, it meant I would open the bowling, so that meant I was in the game straight away, which was fun. That was one thing that made me want to stick with it.</p>
      <p>"And as I got older, I thought not a lot of the other girls were able to bowl as quickly, so that was a point of difference that made me think it would take me somewhere.’’</p>
      <p>So far, Tahuhu has totted up 66 ODIs, taking 70 wickets at 31.2 runs, and 50 T20 internationals, bagging 44 wickets at 20.8 apiece. She’s a blink outside the top 10 in rankings in both forms of the game.</p>
      <p>She made her debut in both disciplines in June 2011, just 11 days apart. The ODI start in Brisbane was made memorable by the game being delayed by a couple of days for bad weather, heightening the nerves, but also for the fact her father was in the stand watching.</p>
      <p>And a third point about that day: she took her maiden international wicket, none other than Australian captain and star batsman Meg Lanning, bowled for 11. As an opening scalp that surely whetted the appetite.</p>
      <p>Being at the top of any particular tree leads inevitably to athletes scrapping hard to avoid relinquishing No.1 spot. Tahuhu is no different.</p>
      <p>There’s a 20-year-old from Bendigo, Tayla Vlaeminck, who is just breaking into the Australian team. She’s been clocked at 120kph and has age on her side.</p>
      <p>She’s also already had two anterior cruciate ligament injuries and a dislocated shoulder, so best wait and see.</p>
      <p>"When you can hit those faster speeds, you don’t want to give it away,’’ Tahuhu says.</p>
      <p>"It can be hard on the body sometimes, but you’ve got to take that gift you’ve been given and do the best you can.’’</p>

      <p>Tahuhu is back from a bizarre injury suffered during the final of India's Women's T20 Challenge in May. As her Supernovas side scored the winning runs, Tahuhu punched the air in victory - painfully dislocating her shoulder. She was back at the bowling crease by August, fortunately avoiding surgery.</p>
      <p>So why is she able to bowl faster than anyone else? No doubt there’s a bit of luck involved in terms of injuries, or lack of them. But Tahuhu has heard other theories.</p>
      <p>"I’ve been told recently it’s my quick arm speed which allows me to get a little bit quicker. But I don’t think pace bowling has a certain makeup, if you will,” she says.</p>
      <p>“Look at [Black Cap star left armer] Trent Boult, he’s on the slender side and can bowl quick, and [Australian] Mitch Starc. Then you have bulkier pace bowlers.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think there’s anything that allows you to do it. It’s a feeling, and for me it’s all about rhythm. If you get good rhythm to and through the crease, then you are able to generate good pace.’’</p>
      <p>Tahuhu turned professional in 2015, getting a Women’s Big Bash League contract with the Melbourne Renegades; with that and her New Zealand Cricket contract, she was able to focus fully on her cricket.</p>
      <p>"It was a really big moment in my life. Not a lot of people can call themselves a professional female cricketer; it is very special and something I’m very thankful for.’’</p>
      <p>The White Ferns’ last two major international assignments have been disappointing. Both the World Cup in 2017 – where they lost to Australia, England and India to miss the semi-finals - and the World T20 in the Caribbean worked out poorly.</p>
      <p>But there are hopes for a significant improvement at the next global T20 event, in Australia in March, and not to forget the 2021 World Cup, which will be staged in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>South Africa are in New Zealand for a lengthy series of matches early next year, acting as a lead-in to the T20 event.</p>
      <p>"We’ve certainly got a very good team and should have a good crack,’’ Tahuhu says of the T20. ‘’Seven of us are playing in the WBBL so that’s going to be good preparation.’’</p>
      <p>As for the World Cup on home turf, it’s all very well to say there’s a lot of cricket to be played before then. Still, it’s in the minds. Tahuhu says the players do talk about it.</p>
      <p>"We want to leave a bit of a legacy on the New Zealand public. Having a home World Cup is incredibly special. I know the girls are really excited and dreaming of holding the trophy aloft before family and friends,’’ she says.</p>
      <p>Tahuhu has a more personal big moment well before then, however, with her first child due to arrive in early January.</p>
      <p>She has it all worked out. The WBBL final is on December 8, which is when she’s hoping she will finish her stint and head home to Satterthwaite in Christchurch.</p>
      <p>Things are, she says, ‘’ticking along well’’. When she gets home ‘"we’ll be on high alert’’, she quips.</p>
      <p>A busy life is about to get a lot busier.</p>
