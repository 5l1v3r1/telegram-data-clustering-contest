      <p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended a secret dinner at the White House last month with President Trump and tech investor Peter Thiel, the social media company confirmed on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The previously undisclosed meeting in October between the social media mogul and the president was first reported by NBC News, who<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-hosted-zuckerberg-undisclosed-dinner-white-house-october-n1087986"> cited a statement from the company</a>.</p>
      <p>“As is normal for a CEO of a major U.S. company, Mark accepted an invitation to have dinner with the President and First Lady at the White House,” a Facebook spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear why Trump entertained Zuckerberg and Thiel, who was a major donor to the president’s 2016 campaign and one of the most outspoken conservatives in Silicon Vally.</p>
      <p>Zuckerberg previously met with Trump in the Oval Office in September, which Facebook later described as a “constructive” meeting.</p>
      <p>“He also had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,” the<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/19/trump-holds-constructive-white-house-meeting-with-mark-zuckerberg/"> spokesperson said after the Sept. 19 meeting</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump tweeted about the Sept. meeting and included an image from the Oval Office: “Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today.”.</p>
