      <p>On this week's broadcast of <b>MBC</b>'s '<b>Sisters' </b><b>Salon</b>', <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/sf9">SF9</a> members <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/dawon">Dawon</a> and <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/chani">Chani</a> appeared as guests, hoping to transform some of Chani's fashion and style habits!</p>
      <p>Dawon, who came to tattle on some of Chani's apathetic fashion choices, spilled, <i>"I want to throw away the slippers that Chani always wears. Whether we're going to the airport or to our schedules, he's always in those slippers. I would think, 'Do I need to throw one of the slippers out while he's not looking'..." </i></p>
      <p>Chani, on the other hand, explained that he has never been particularly interested in fashion in his life, and that his mother mostly bought his clothes for him until recently. <i>"When I was younger, my mother bought me my clothes, but now that she asked me to do it myself, I end up buying less clothes. I buy clothes about 1 or 2 times a year." </i></p>
      <p>The 'Sisters' Salon' MCs then went on to inquire how many clothes Chani actually owned, to which Chani replied,<i> "I own about 4 pairs of pants, including the ones I'm wearing."</i> Then, when asked about tops, Chani brightened and revealed, <i>"I do own a lot more tops. I own about 6-7 of them,"</i> shocking the 'Sisters' Salon' crew members!</p>
