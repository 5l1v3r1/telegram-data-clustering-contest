      <p>KOLKATA: Some of the India players stayed back in Indore, after the series opener ended in three days, to practise under lights. But the entire team got its first feel of twilight at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> on Wednesday, two days ahead of the first-ever <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/day-night-Test">day-night Test</a> on Indian soil.</p>
      <p>Of course, Wriddhiman Saha and Mohammed Shami have been through it once, during the CAB Super League final here in 2016, but there are just too many differences to compare the two events.</p>
      <p>“First of all, we played with the Kookaburra ball, but here SG will be used,” Saha said before joining the team for nets on Tuesday afternoon. That means, narrower and more pronounced seam. “The timings were also different,” the local man pointed out.</p>
      <p>A 1 pm start to a day-night Test has happened only once before. Moreover, the local league final was held in May, when the heat had almost negated the dew factor, which could have a major influence in this contest. In late November, with the temperature gradually on the decline, water droplets are certain to find their way on the grass blades once the sun sinks.</p>
      <p>“There will be challenges, of course,” Saha admitted about the forthcoming contest which starts on Friday. “But then, we have to adjust.” The wicketkeeper also spoke about the ‘twilight’ zone, surely a widely googled term in the cricketing world since it was announced that the Eden Test would be held under lights. “Sometimes, it is difficult to pick the ball during this period,” he said. “Challenging for the wicketkeeper too, as our pacers make the ball wobble.”</p>
      <p>Fielders at slip and those positioned square of the wicket have found it difficult to pick the ball at twilight. The Indians were seen trying to address the problem as part of their fielding drills.</p>
      <p>In fact, it’s the behaviour of the ball from sunset and beyond that will be the talking point on the first day. And as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> spin-bowling coach Daniel Vettori pointed out repeatedly, sun sets early in this part of the world and more time will have to be spent under lights than in other day-night Tests. Just as the New Zealander had predicted, by 4.30 pm on Tuesday, the floodlights were on in full glow to facilitate the Indians’ nets.</p>
      <p>Even though India have been all over Bangladesh, barring the first T20 International, Saha refused to agree that this one could also turn out to be a walk in the park. “Every international match is challenging, it doesn’t matter whether the opponents are Australia or Bangladesh,” he remarked.</p>
      <p>But the wicketkeeper did accept that the Indian pacers could be a handful for the Bangladeshi batsmen. Shami, in particular, has been in red-hot form and the fact that he had picked up seven wickets in the only pink-ball match played at this venue, will boost his confidence. “Red or pink, Shami will have the batsmen in trouble,” Saha said. “He is in the kind of form which makes him difficult to handle.”</p>
      <p>The curator will, of course, leave more grass on the turf than he would for a normal Test. That, Saha reckoned, would help the pacers. “It will make things more challenging for the batsmen,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, he also reckoned extracting reverse swing will be quite difficult. In the same breath, he added that the Indian pacers are talented enough to make the ball go the other way even in this situation. Clearly, Saha has high regard for his teammates and given that he has to stand behind the wickets, he would not want them to get too ambitious during the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/twilight-period">twilight period</a>.</p>
