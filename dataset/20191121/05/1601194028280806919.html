      <p>England made a solid start to the first Test against New Zealand thanks largely to Joe Denly and Ben Stokes on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Denly (74) and Stokes (67 not out) helped England reach 241-4 at stumps on day one after the tourists opted to bat in Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>Rory Burns (52) also made a half-century as Chris Silverwood's team stayed patient at Bay Oval to put themselves in a decent position.</p>
      <p>Colin de Grandhomme (2-28) was the pick of New Zealand's bowlers, while Tim Southee (1-46) and Neil Wagner (1-77) also took wickets.</p>
      <p>But Stokes, given a late life, and Ollie Pope (18) managed to get to stumps on a fine opening day for England.</p>

      <p>After England decided to bat under sunny skies, Burns and debutant Dom Sibley made a good start.</p>
      <p>Burns was lucky to survive when on 10, appearing to edge Trent Boult (0-61) behind, only to be given not out as the Black Caps opted not to review.</p>
      <p>England had scored heavily through the leg side early in the day before De Grandhomme struck, Sibley (22) edging to Ross Taylor at first slip.</p>
      <p>Denly joined Burns as the tourists continued to enjoy the better start to the Test, the latter escaping an lbw review when on 44.</p>
      <p>After Burns brought up his fifth Test 50, De Grandhomme delivered another breakthrough for New Zealand as the opener edged through to BJ Watling.</p>
      <p>Joe Root (2) had struggled as the Black Caps kept things tight, the England captain's 22-ball stay ending when he edged to Southee off Wagner.</p>

      <p>They were the wickets New Zealand needed before tea, and Denly brought up his fifth Test half-century with a brilliant drive off Wagner after the break.</p>
      <p>Stokes and Denly looked comfortable approaching stumps, but the second new ball brought the hosts another wicket.</p>
      <p>A ball after another fine boundary, Denly edged Southee and a diving Watling took a good catch to his right.</p>
      <p>New Zealand squandered a great chance late in the day, Taylor dropping Stokes – who was on 67 – at slip off Boult to ensure England were left in a fine position.</p>
