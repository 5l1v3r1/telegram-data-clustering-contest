      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>22-year-old Shivam Munjal was done with constant body-shaming and the looks people gave him owing to his weight. He had touched a whopping 99 kilos and felt tired all the time. This is how he lost a whopping 25 kilos by working out at home with unwavering dedication.</p>
      <p><b>Name:</b> Shivam Munjal</p>
      <p><b>Occupation: </b>Student</p>
      <p><b>Age</b>: 22 years</p>
      <p><b>City:</b> Bahadurgarh</p>
      <p><b>Height:</b> 5 feet 8 inches</p>
      <p><b>Current Weight: </b>74 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Highest weight recorded: </b>99 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Weight lost:</b> 25 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Duration it took me to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/10-exercises-to-lose-weight-in-10-minutes/from-fat-to-fit-in-10-minutes/photostory/58490883.cms">lose weight</a>:</b> 7 months</p>
      <p><b>The turning point:</b> When I was overweight, I used to get exhausted really easily. Moreover, I was tired of body shaming and the looks people gave me because of my weight. I realised that I needed to do something about my weight if I wanted to change the way I was living my life. My girlfriend broke up with me because of the way I looked and it left me really depressed.</p>
      <p><b>My breakfast</b>: A cup of oats in milk with almonds and walnuts.</p>
      <p><b>My lunch:</b> 2 chapatis with 1 bowl of dal, salad and 1 bowl of vegetable raita.</p>
      <p><b>My dinner:</b> Protein shake after working out and paneer or soya bean one hour later.</p>
      <p><b>I indulge in:</b> I really enjoy eating besan chilla on my cheat days.</p>
      <p><b>My workout:</b> I did not join any gym and use to do bodyweight exercises and some dumbbell workout at home for 7 months straight.</p>
      <p><b>Here's my workout schedule:<br/>Monday</b>: Chest and 30 minutes of high-intensity cardio</p>
      <p><b>Tuesday</b>: Back and jogging for 30 minutes</p>
      <p><b>Wednesday</b>: Arm workout and cardio</p>
      <p><b>Thursday:</b> High-intensity Tabata workout. Tabata is a whole body workout with 8 different exercises in an interval of 4 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Friday</b>: Shoulder workout and cardio</p>
      <p>Saturday and Sunday rest.</p>
      <p><b>Fitness secrets I unveiled:</b> It is all about the efforts you put in to lose weight. I had joined a gym a few years ago but did not give my hundred per cent. So, even though I lost some weight, I gained it back again very soon. Hence, it is important to be consistent and eat healthily. While being a vegetarian, it was difficult to find the right diet, but I managed to lose weight without doing any special diet. I have realised that a calorie deficit diet is the only thing you need to lose weight.</p>
      <p><b>How do I stay motivated</b>? There were a lot of moments in my life when I thought of giving up and in those times the only thing that kept me going was the quote-- “I didn't come this far to only come this far”. While everyone says that looks don’t matter and you need to have a good heart, it is all a lie. When you are overweight, people will body shame you, discriminate against you and look at you with disgust. I was tired of the way people looked at me and I wanted to get rid of that.</p>
      <p><b>How do you ensure you don’t lose focus? </b>I make it a point to keep switching my workout schedule so that I did not get bored.</p>
      <p><b>What’s the most difficult part of being overweight? </b>In addition to facing constant body-shaming, I also felt really lethargic all the time.</p>
      <p><b>What shape do you see yourself 10 years down the line? </b>Now that I have achieved my goal weight, I want to work on gaining muscles.</p>
      <p><b>What are the lifestyle changes you made? </b>I have made it a point to wake up early in the morning, no matter what.</p>
      <p><b>What was the lowest point for you? </b>What happened with me when I was overweight may sound like a bit of cliche but it is true. My girlfriend cheated on me and the reason she gave me for the same was really heartbreaking. She said that she did not have any feelings for me because of the I way I looked and it was devastating. I was really depressed for one whole year after that and it took me a while to snap out of it.</p>
      <p><b>Lessons learnt from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss">weight loss</a>:</b> It is important to understand that consistency is the key when it comes to weight loss. All you need is a little bit of patience and unwavering focus and you will certainly reach your desired goal.</p>
