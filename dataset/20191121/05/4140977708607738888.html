          <p>During the first day of the first Test of the ongoing Pakistan’s tour of Australia in Brisbane, Australia captain Tim Paine commenced the Australia summer in this format by exchanging words with his wicket-keeping counterpart in Mohammad Rizwan.</p>
          <p>It all happened during the 46th over of the Australian innings when spinner Nathan Lyon was bowling to Rizwan. Paine, who is usually chirpy from behind the wickets, continued with his knack of saying things albeit in a healthy manner.</p>

                <p>After the fourth delivery, Paine was heard on the stump mic assuming that Rizwan would sweep the next ball for a boundary. While the right-hand batsman defended the following delivery, Paine found Rizwan’s smell to be nice. “He [Mohammad Rizwan] smells very nice,” Paine was heard as saying to the short-leg fielder.</p>
                <p>Coming in to bat at No. 7 in the same over, an aggressive Rizwan was seen taking the attack on the Australian bowlers. Before getting out in the 55th over, Rizwan ended up scoring 37 (34) with the help of seven fours.</p>

                      <p>It was Pakistan captain Azhar Ali who won the toss and chose to bat. While a 75-run opening partnership between Shan Masood (27) and Azhar Ali (39) laid the foundation for the visitors, them losing five wickets for 19 runs saw them not banking on the initial advantage.</p>
                      <p>With Pakistan losing six wickets at the time of writing this article, all of the four Australian bowlers have contributed in the wickets column.</p>
