      <p><b>WASHINGTON: </b>A senior US diplomat directly implicated President Donald Trump Wednesday in a scheme to force Ukraine to probe a political rival, in bombshell testimony to a televised impeachment hearing.</p>
      <p>Gordon Sondland, the US envoy to the European Union and a Trump ally, told lawmakers he followed Trump’s orders in seeking a “quid pro quo” deal for Ukraine to probe Democrat Joe Biden in exchange for a White House summit.</p>
      <p>The US leader, Sondland said, directed him and other diplomats to work with his personal lawyer Giuliani, who he said mounted a pressure campaign on the government of Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>

      <p>Giuliani’s demands, he said, were for Kiev to investigate Biden and to probe a conspiracy theory, espoused by Trump, that Ukraine helped Democrats against him in 2016.</p>
      <p>“Mr Giuliani’s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky,” Sondland said.</p>
      <p>Far from being a “rogue” operation outside normal US diplomatic channels, Sondland told the hearing top officials in the White House and State Department — including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — were kept constantly informed.</p>
      <p>“We followed the president’s orders,” in working with Giuliani, he testified before the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
      <p>Democrats said Sondland’s testimony strongly supported allegations of abuse of power that would justify Trump’s impeachment.</p>
      <p>“Today’s testimony is among the most significant evidence to date,” said Adam Schiff, the committee chairman leading the inquiry.</p>
      <p>“It goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery as well as other potential high crimes or misdemeanors,” he said.</p>
      <p>Tweeting as he headed to Texas on board Air Force One, Trump asserted on the contrary that Sondland had exonerated him, and demanded an immediate end to the impeachment probe.</p>
      <p>“Impeachment Witch Hunt is now OVER!” Trump wrote. “This Witch Hunt must end NOW. So bad for our Country!”</p>
      <p>Addressing reporters earlier at the White House, Trump reenacted segments of the day’s testimony to hammer home his point.</p>
      <p>“‘What do you want from Ukraine?'” the president quoted Sondland as asking him, reading from large-print notes.</p>
      <p>“Here is my answer: ‘I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing,'” added the president.</p>
      <p>“I would say that means it’s all over.”</p>
      <p>Trump also sought to distance himself from Sondland — whose testimony was closely watched as a political appointee — saying he did “not know him very well.”</p>
      <p>A hotel developer named ambassador after donating $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, Sondland was at the centre of efforts to convince Zelensky to do the US bidding on the investigations in order to obtain a meeting with Trump, and also to unlock $391 million on aid put on hold in July.</p>
      <p>Sondland told lawmakers a White House summit was explicitly tied to the investigations, meant to target Burisma, an Ukrainian energy company on which former vice president Biden’s son Hunter had held a paid board position.</p>
      <p>But he said he figured out himself that the unexplained, White House-ordered hold on security aid was also tied to the investigations — although he never discussed the issue with Trump.</p>
      <p>“In the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 election and Burisma, as Mr Giuliani had demanded,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement” of the investigations, he added.</p>
      <p>Pressed on how much he knew of Trump’s motivations and his discussions with other officials, Sondland frequently said he “could not remember” certain details.</p>
      <p>But he stressed that all the top foreign affairs-related officials in the Trump administration were “in the loop” on his Ukraine activities.</p>
      <p>He said Pompeo had directed the US pointman on Ukraine, Ambassador Kurt Volker, to also work with Giuliani.</p>
      <p>Asked if Pompeo had been made aware that Trump wanted a Ukrainian investigation of Biden in exchange for a meeting and aid, Sondland replied: “Yes.”</p>

      <p>Pompeo has repeatedly denounced the impeachment inquiry and has drawn fire for failing to defend career employees caught up in the scandal.</p>
      <p>Sondland’s testimony firmed up the possibility the investigation could wrap up this week, with evidence then sent to the House Judiciary Committee to draw up articles of impeachment — formal charges against the president.</p>
      <p>Trump’s impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House would place him on trial in the Senate, where a Republican majority could protect him from removal.</p>
