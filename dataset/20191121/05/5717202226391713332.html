        <b><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7707847/Martin-Keown-calls-Arsenal-Mauricio-Pochettino.html">In comments reported by the Daily Mail</a>, Martin Keown has criticised Tottenham Hotspur over the handling of Mauricio Pochettino’s departure, and insisted that Arsenal have to consider a move for the Argentinian.</b>

      <p>While there had been a major question mark hanging over Pochettino’s future, it caught many off-guard when it was announced on Tuesday that he had been sacked by Spurs.</p>

      <p>And just as the fans were getting their heads around the announcement, Tottenham swiftly confirmed that Jose Mourinho had been appointed as his successor.</p>
      <p>Keown admitted that he was not entirely comfortable with how the recent events played out. And he added that the Gunners have to consider making an approach for Pochettino.</p>

      <p>“I would have stayed with Pochettino. I think he deserved that. I think it’s a hugely significant sacking. You’re going to have managers now looking over their shoulders,” he said, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7707847/Martin-Keown-calls-Arsenal-Mauricio-Pochettino.html">as reported by the Daily Mail</a>.</p>
      <p>“I know the poor record he has recently. I know it all but I still would have given him another chance. I don’t like the way Tottenham have done it.</p>
      <p>“There will be a lot of chairmen looking at him now. Manchester United wanted him this time last year. I think Arsenal would have to be interested if they want to take a step forward.”</p>
      <h3>TBR View</h3>
      <p>Given the tenure that Pochettino enjoyed, it is difficult to imagine Arsenal being able to land him anytime soon. Even if Unai Emery does depart in the near future, it feels as if plenty of dust needs to settle before Pochettino even considers such a controversial move.</p>
      <p>Of course, it would be foolish to say it will not happen. It is not an unprecedented move. But it certainly does seem incredibly unlikely.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it would not be a huge surprise if a number of Arsenal fans were urging the board to make a move while Pochettino is available.</p>
