      <p>Home Secretary Priti Patel has arrogantly denied poverty is the Government's fault.</p>
      <p>The top Tory deflected blame onto councils and others as she tried to absolve her party of responsibility after nearly a decade of cruel austerity.</p>
      <p>When told that four in 10 children in parts of Barrow, Cumbria, are born into poverty, she told BBC North West Tonight: “Well it’s appalling.</p>
      <p>"But of course everybody, and it’s not just people in Westminster, it’s not just at a national level it’s at a local level.”</p>
      <p>Responding to the suggestion that nine years of Tory rule were responsible, she said: “Well it’s not the Government though is it?</p>

      <p>“Everybody just says it’s the Government as if it’s this sort of like bland blob that you know, you can just go and blame.”</p>
      <p>Asked if she was saying the Government was not responsible for poverty, she replied: “Well, it’s not.</p>
      <p>“Because it’s all parts of society and the structures.</p>
      <p>“Local authorities have a role to play, education and public services, which are locally led and locally run.”</p>
      <p>It hasn't stopped her husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/priti-patels-husband-said-tories-20927175">blaming the Tories for homelessness though.</a></p>
      <p>Bexley councillor Alex Sawyer said in April: "Successive governments have made a pig's ear of the issue of homelessness and house buildings."</p>

      <p>Mrs Patel made the comments despite years of swingeing councils cuts under the Tories that have forced town halls to cut jobs and vital services.</p>
      <p>In the decade to 2020, councils will have suffered cuts in core funding from the Government of £16billion.</p>
      <p>And authorities face an alarming funding gap of £7.8billion by 2025, it was warned last year.</p>
      <p>The Mirror previously revealed how foodbank demand has rocketed by 3,772 per cent under a decade of Tory rule.</p>
      <p>Bombshell figures show a surge in need from hungry families after nine years of gruelling austerity.</p>
      <p>Britain’s biggest foodbank network had 57 outlets open in the final year of the  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a>  government in 2009/10.</p>

      <p>They provided 40,898 aid packages – the equivalent of 368,082 meals. Of those parcels, 13,959 went to children.</p>
      <p>By the end of March the network had 425 foodbanks – a 646% increase.</p>
      <p>Their volunteers gave away 1,583,668 packages – 14,253,012 meals – in 2018/19. Some 577,618 parcels went to children.</p>
      <p>The Social Metrics Commission found there are 14.3million people in poverty in Britain.</p>
