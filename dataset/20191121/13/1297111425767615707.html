      <h1>Regina product Carson Denomie embraces homecoming after being traded to Pats</h1>
      <h2>The Pats acquired Regina-born forward Carson Denomie from the Moose Jaw Warriors on Monday for centre Garrett Wright.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:00:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>Carson Denomie has a reputation for beating the Regina Pats, but how does he feel about joining them?</p>
      <p>That was the obvious question after <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats-acquire-local-product-carson-denomie-from-moose-jaw-warriors">Regina acquired the 19-year-old forward from the Moose Jaw Warriors on Monday for centre Garrett Wright</a>.</p>
      <p>Although the deal gives Denomie a rare opportunity to play in his hometown, it also meant leaving a potential playoff team for a rebuilding club that sits in the league basement.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t say I look at this as a negative at all,” said Denomie, who made his Pats’ debut <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/sergei-alkhimov-leads-swift-current-broncos-to-2-1-win-over-regina-pats">Tuesday night in a 2-1 loss to the Swift Current Broncos</a>. “It’s exciting (to join Regina). I’m going to get lots of opportunities. I’m just going to try and run with it.”</p>
      <p>Denomie began his WHL career with the Kamloops Blazers, who <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/reginas-carson-denomie-finds-new-home-with-warriors">shipped him to Moose Jaw halfway through last season</a>. The Regina native quickly made himself at home, notching two goals and one assist in four meetings with the Pats — all wins.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/moose-jaw-warriors-hand-regina-pats-their-sixth-straight-loss">Denomie kept the ball rolling this season with four goals in three games versus Regina (two wins, one loss)</a>.</p>
      <p>“Four of my five goals this year are against the Pats so it’ll be nice to get one wearing the Pats’ jersey,” said Denomie, who grew up cheering for the club. “I had season tickets for about seven, eight years. I came to a lot of games, saw Jordan Eberle, Colten Teubert, a bunch of those guys.”</p>
      <p>Denomie wore the same colours with the Regina Pat Canadians, who won a Saskatchewan midget AAA title in 2017. He was named a second-team all-star that year after compiling 16 goals and 46 points in 44 regular-season games.</p>
      <p>The Pats are hoping he’ll add some punch to their scoring-starved lineup. The 6-foot-0, 196-pounder had five goals and 13 points in 19 games this season with Moose Jaw.</p>
      <p>“I think I have a pretty good skill set so I’m looking forward to using it,” he said before Wednesday’s game against the Calgary Hitmen. “If the opportunity comes where I’m playing in the top six, getting some good minutes and playing on the power play, I’ll definitely have the chances to score. Then I guess it’ll just be up to me to put the puck in the net.”</p>
      <p>The Pats believe he will.</p>
      <p>Although he couldn’t quite bury one on Tuesday against Swift Current, Denomie had several quality chances while recording five shots on goal.</p>
      <p>“I thought he was good,” said head coach Dave Struch. “He struggled a little bit early just with the pace of the game and the way we like to play. As the game went on we could see he’s going to be a good player for us. He can handle the puck. He shoots the puck well. He’ll get more opportunities (against Calgary) and learn from the experience.”</p>
      <p>Having gone through a trade last season, Denomie knows it could take some time before he completely settles in. The comforts of home should help, especially since he didn’t see the deal coming.</p>
      <p>“It definitely took me by surprise,” he said. “It was mixed emotions (at the time). It was a little upsetting leaving the boys in Moose Jaw but obviously the chance to come home and play for my home-town team was really exciting.”</p>
