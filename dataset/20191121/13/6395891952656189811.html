      <p><b>BROOKLINE, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - The suspect in Brookline's first homicide in 13 years is heading to court.</p>
      <p>Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey says 21-year-old Singha Oeun is scheduled to be arraigned on a murder charge Thursday in the death of Nicolas Kern.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old victim was stabbed multiple times in Amory Park at about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday and died at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Police Chief Andrew Lipson did not disclose a motive but says the men knew each other and there is no threat to the public. Both men lived in Brookline.</p>
      <p>Kern's death is the first homicide in the Boston suburb since 2006.</p>
      <p>It could not be determined if the suspect had an attorney.</p>
      <p>Amory Park is a family-friendly facility of about eight acres with ballfields, walking trails and tennis courts.</p>
