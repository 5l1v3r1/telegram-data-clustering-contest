      <p>iHarare today visited veteran television actress Rhoda Mtembe, popularly known as Amai Sorobhi in the yesteryear hit drama series “Paraffin”. We visited Gogo Mtembe at her house in Kuwadzana Extension, after receiving reports that she was unwell and in need of aid for medical bills, food and crutches as she is unable to walk.</p>
      <p>Gogo Mtembe suffered a stroke early this year and is now handicapped. She is barely able to walk on her own or to perform day to day tasks. She is currently living with her daughter Charity who is taking care of her every need, including moving her around the house when she needs to.</p>
