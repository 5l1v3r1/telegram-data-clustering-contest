      <p>Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/trump-impeachment-hearings-what-to-know-for-thursdays-testimony/">has begun her testimony before the House Intelligence Committee</a> in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.</p>
      <p>Hill is expected to tell lawmakers that one of the central Republican talking points — that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US election — is a “fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services.”</p>
      <p>In her prepared testimony, Hill stresses that she is a “nonpartisan foreign policy expert” who has served Republican and Democratic administrations, adding that the conclusion by US intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election “is beyond dispute.”</p>
      <p>“I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternative narrative that the Ukrainian government is a US adversary, and that Ukraine — not Russia — attacked us in 2016,” she says in her prepared statement.</p>
      <p>“Our nation is being torn apart. Truth is questioned,” she says about the impact of the 2016 Russian campaign.</p>
      <p>Hill, a top aide to then-National Security Adviser John Bolton, also says in her prepared remarks that “if the president, or anyone else, impedes or subverts the national security of the United States in order to further domestic or political affairs,” it is worth the lawmakers’ attention.</p>
      <p>She adds: “I have no interest in advancing the outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction, except toward the truth.”</p>
      <p>Trump has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing as the House panel looks into his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats and political rival Joe Biden.</p>
