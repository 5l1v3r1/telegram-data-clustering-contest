      <p>Competition in China’s food delivery sector has become less cut-throat as companies roll back profit-damaging subsidies, which in turn has allowed Meituan to capitalize on its first-mover advantage over rivals in the country’s smaller cities.</p>
      <p>According to research firm Trustdata, Meituan has steadily increased its share of China’s food delivery market to 65.8% as of end-September, compared with 60.1% a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Revenue for Meituan, which is China’s third-biggest internet company by market value and is backed by gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, came in at 27.49 billion yuan ($3.5 billion) for the July-September quarter, up from 19.1 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier.</p>
      <p>That compares with a market consensus estimate of 25.92 billion yuan drawn from 11 analysts, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.</p>
      <p>It booked a profit of 1.33 billion yuan, its second consecutive quarter of profit since listing last September.</p>
      <p>“The two consecutive quarters of profitability gives investors more confidence on the food delivery business model,” said David Dai, an analyst at Bernstein Research.</p>
      <p>Meituan’s food delivery division - its core business - reported revenue of 15.58 billion yuan in the quarter, a 39.4% increase from a year earlier.</p>
      <p>“Strong execution enabled Meituan to sustain [the] growth momentum, improve unit economics, and enhance the market position of core businesses,” said Wang Xing, chairman and chief executive of Meituan, adding that consumers from lower-tier cities would become the future source of growth.</p>
      <p>Meituan said gross transaction volumes for the quarter rose 33.6% to 194.6 billion yuan, while the annual number of transacting users climbed 14% to 435.8 million.    Valued at some $72 billion, Meituan operates one of China’s most popular apps, also offering travel bookings, restaurant recommendations, movie tickets, bike sharing and map services. It has also set up a grocery retail business Meituan Maicai.</p>
