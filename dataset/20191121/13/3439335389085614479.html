      <p>News anchor Shawn Ching is leaving Hawaii News Now to spend more time with his wife and one-year-old son, he said in a letter posted on the TV station’s website.</p>
      <p>Ching’s son, Eli, was born premature last year and his wife, Stephanie, experienced complications related to the early birth, he said in the letter.</p>
      <p>“Our son’s birth changed everything. It opened up a completely new life for me, a life I’ve fallen in love with,” Ching said. “When you think about death — and are faced with the very real possibility of losing the ones you love — it changes how you think about your own life. Taking that fact to heart has brought a sense of clarity and energy to the present. I know I’ve got this one opportunity to be present at a time when I’m needed most.”</p>
      <p>The longtime anchor who rejoined the TV station in November 2016 after a three-year break to be a lawyer is co-anchor of the 5 p.m. newscast with Stephanie Lum. Ching will return to practicing law.</p>
      <p>“He’s been through a real ordeal with the birth of his son. We’ve lived through this with him,” HNN General Manager Rick Blangiardi told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “He has my complete respect and admiration for making this decision.”</p>
      <p>Blangiardi, who posted Ching’s job nationally last Friday, said that he is looking to fill the position with someone with strong ties to Hawaii.</p>
