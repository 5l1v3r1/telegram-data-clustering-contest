      <p>(Reuters) - France’s Mike Lorenzo-Vera overcame a lung infection to shoot the lowest-ever round at the DP World Tour Championship on Thursday, while Bernd Wiesberger stayed in pole position for the season-ending Race to Dubai title.</p>

      <p>Lorenzo-Vera holed four straight birdies to finish the back nine at Jumeirah Golf Estates, carding a nine-under-par 63 in the opening round as he matched his lowest ever score to par on the European Tour.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old made a flying start with an eagle on the par-five second and a birdie on the third and while he dropped a shot on the next, another gain on the seventh gave him a share of the lead before taking full control.</p>
      <p>Having struggled with illness during a final-round 80 at last week’s Nedbank Golf Challenge, Lorenzo-Vera was pleased to claim an early one-shot advantage at the European Tour’s season-finale in Dubai.</p>
      <p>“Honestly I’m not feeling well at all,” he said. “I have no energy. I had a big lung infection in South Africa and a big treatment and really feel bad on top of that.</p>
      <p>“I felt that if I really relaxed a lot, just swing it like 70% or maybe less, the ball was still flying pretty well. Try to be pretty clever and not too aggressive and then the putter got hot. So that worked.”</p>
      <p>World number two Rory McIlroy had five birdies and three lip outs on the front nine and finished with an eagle at the par-five 18th on his way to an impressive round of 64.</p>
      <p>Race to Dubai leader Wiesberger, who needs a win or a solo second in Dubai to guarantee that he wins the Harry Vardon Trophy, finished the day at two-under, a shot clear of fellow contender Matthew Fitzpatrick and three ahead of British Open champion Shane Lowry.</p>
      <p>Spain’s Jon Rahm, who is also among the five players who can be crowned the European Tour’s Order of Merit winner this weekend, piled the pressure on Wiesberger with a bogey-free 66.</p>
      <p>England’s Tommy Fleetwood, who moved up to second in the Race to Dubai Rankings with victory at the Nedbank Golf Challenge last week, continued his brilliant run with a 67 to sit alongside compatriot Tom Lewis four shots off the lead.</p>
