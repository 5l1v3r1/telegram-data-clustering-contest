      <p><b>San Francisco, </b> Apple has teamed up with 100cameras, a nonprofit organization that teaches adolescents the foundations of photography and visual storytelling by donating new iPhone 11 to participating students of DRW College Prep in Chicago.</p>
      <p>As per report, the students are encouraged to tell their personal stories about growing up in a city that faces increasing gentrification and gun violence.</p>
      <p>"It was amazing to collaborate with 100cameras and the talented and creative students at DRW, the iPhone 11 camera with all its intuitive capabilities right there in your hand is such a powerful storytelling tool. To see the photos the students captured of the ways they see the world around them was truly inspiring," Kaiann Drance, Apple's Vice President of iPhone Worldwide Product Marketing said in a statement recently.</p>
      <p>After each program, prints of the students' photos are sold through 100cameras and 100 per cent of proceeds go back to the local community partner organizations they visit.</p>
      <p>"As the residents of a neighbourhood in Chicago that is often overlooked, being given the new iPhone that had been released just a few weeks prior felt like a momentous opportunity," Angela Popplewell, 100cameras' co-founder and CEO added.</p>
