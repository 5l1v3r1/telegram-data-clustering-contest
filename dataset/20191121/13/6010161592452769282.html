      <h1>Pokemon Sword and Shield has sold over 6 million copies in a week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:13:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>Pokemon Sword and Shield is already one of the most successful games in the series.</p>
      <p>The Pokemon Company has <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/corporate/PostImages/b1b2b7b4ea55eef149f2bc849c194eea958c68c6.pdf">announced</a> [PDF] that <b>Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield</b> have together sold over 6 million units globally, 2 million of which just in Japan.</p>
      <p>Not only does this beat Super Smash Bros. Ultimate’s 5 million, it’s over double that of Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee’s 3 million in the first week, and well above Pokemon X and Y’s 4 million.</p>
      <p>As the press release notes, this is a new record for Nintendo Switch.</p>

      <p>Analyst Daniel Ahmad also points out that, at this rate, Sword and Shield could overtake Let’s Go’s lifetime sales “as early as Q1 2020.”</p>

      <p>Interestingly, this is lower than Pokemon Sun and Moon, which <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1197455202493833217">sold 7.2 million in its first week</a> on sale. The only caveat is that Sun and Moon launched in a different week in Europe, but week one sales combined are all above Sword and Shield’s.</p>
