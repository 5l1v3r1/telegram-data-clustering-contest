      <h1>Jamie Carragher explains how Jurgen Klopp should manage squad through fixture congestion</h1>
      <h2>The Reds legend says the Premier League is the be-all and end-all.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:15:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Carragher feels nothing can come in the way of Liverpool winning the Premier League and says that the Club World Cup is far more important than the EFL Cup.</p>
      <p>Carragher does not want a single first teamer to face Aston Villa in the quarter finals of the League Cup in order to keep everyone fresh for the title charge.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jamie-carragher-liverpools-club-world-17276123?_ga=2.202795155.386448696.1574092380-1250692569.1477910750">Liverpool Echo, he said</a>: “If Liverpool get through they will have two semi-finals to play and that cannot get in the way of Liverpool winning the league. Do not play anyone in your first XI in that Carabao Cup team. Not one. Nothing can be allowed to get in the way of Liverpool pushing on and winning the league.”</p>
      <p>“The Club World Cup is very important. A lot of people outside Liverpool don’t understand that. They have never won it before. To say you’re the world champions. Liverpool have won the League Cup a record amount of times and will have other chances. It might be another 20 years before we get the chance to become world champions again.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Club World Cup may be important but flying halfway around the world for it goes against Carragher’s insistence on the league at all costs</h3>
      <p>Carragher says nothing can get in the way of Liverpool winning the Premier League but is happy for Liverpool to fly over to Qatar for a mid-season tournament which offers little more than status.</p>
      <p>It’s a strange approach to square. Of course Liverpool have the squad to cope and win both tournaments, but both the EFL Cup and Club World Cup should be put in the long grass at the expense of the title chase.</p>
