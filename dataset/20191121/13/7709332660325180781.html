      <p>I've been doing this web thing for money for 10 years this year and although I haven’t been around as long as some folks, I feel like I've seen a few cycles come and go now, so let's say that hot new things are often cynically viewed, initially. This milestone of mine has also got me in a retrospective mood, too, and the question “What about building websites has you interested this year?“ has only encouraged that.</p>
      <p>When I first came into the industry, I was an out-and-out designer, delivering static comps to developers until after one-too-many poor builds of my work: I decided to get into code myself. Naturally I focused purely on the front-end—specifically HTML and CSS. Yes, I got a bit into JavaScript too (once Flash became fully irrelevant), but markup and styles have always been my favorite things about web technology. I've never really been into back-end development, either. Sure, I can do it, but it’s certainly not my strong suit and usually this weakens my offering a touch—especially as a freelance web designer. Well, it <i>did</i> weaken me, until now.</p>
      <h3>JAMstack: an awful name, but awfully empowering.</h3>
      <p>I love JAMstack because it empowers people like me, who aren’t very strong with back-end stuff, and the aspect of JAMstack that I like the most—and which I think is the best part—is static site generators (SSGs). I’m talking specifically about SSGs like <a href="https://www.11ty.io/">Eleventy</a> and less-so <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> here, for reference.</p>
      <p>The biggest reason that I like SSGs like Eleventy is that I can have a completely flexible, component-driven codebase that at build-time, compiles down to nothing but lovely, static HTML. You still get the power of JavaScript too, but instead of forcing it down the pipe, you run it at compile-time. This has enabled me to do some pretty darn complex stuff. Eleventy does all of this at lightning speed, too.</p>
      <p>Mix Eleventy with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and in some cases, <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, and suddenly you have a powerful development setup which results in a fast, performant website that auto-deploys. It’s perfect setup for me.</p>
      <p>This stuff excites me so much that I made an Eleventy starter kit this year called <a href="https://hylia.website/">Hylia</a>. I did this for two reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I wanted to test the viability of a content-managed static-site that uses source controlled content. I chose <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a> to do this</li>
        <li>I wanted to empower people without tech skills to publish a performant, accessible blog of their own, so they didn’t have to rely on centralised systems</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The platform went down really well and I think part of the reason for its success is that even though it’s (optionally) content managed, powered by <a href="https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/">design tokens</a> and fully componentized, it performs <i>really well</i> because all you get is HTML and CSS with a bit of progressively enhanced JavaScript.</p>
      <p>This is the magic of SSGs, because they give us <i>developer experience</i>, but much more importantly, because the output is static and lightweight (unless you prevent that with lots of code), it creates a really solid basis for a good <i>user experience</i>, too! This isn’t just the case for small projects like Hylia, too, because SSGs can even power huge projects like the <a href="https://www.duetds.com/">Duet</a> <a href="https://www.duetds.com/">Design System</a>, for example.</p>
      <p>Looking back at the empowerment that SSGs enable, I’ll just list some things that they have enabled <i>me</i>, a web designer, to do this year:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://every-layout.dev/">Self-publish a book</a>
        </li>
        <li>Create rapid, interactive prototypes for clients which has completely transformed the decision making process</li>
        <li>Build actual, full websites for clients</li>
        <li>Completely transform my design process to use HTML and CSS as a deliverables, rather than static comps</li>
        <li>Build and document an incredibly comprehensive, multi-platform design system (WIP)</li>
        <li>Re-platform my <a href="http://piccalil.li/">CSS newsletter</a> (WIP)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are <i>huge</i> things that have had a massive, positive impact on me and next year, SSGs are only going to feature more in my work as I transition into providing educational material, too.</p>
      <h3>Wrapping up</h3>
      <p>The future is bright with the JAMstack and SSGs—especially when what is delivered to the end-user is fast, progressively enhanced websites. I honestly think that they are creating a momentum wave towards a bigger focus in performance, too.</p>
      <p>If we chuck in some <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/">serverless technology</a>: suddenly, designers and front-end developers really are <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-all-powerful-front-end-developer/">all powerful</a> and this <i>really</i> excites me because suddenly, we give lots of people power to have <i>great ideas</i> that might not have been able to before.</p>
