      <p>"I said: 'Dear Lord Provost, thank you very much for your wonderful invitation to turn on the Christmas lights on Union Street in Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, due to a prior engagement, I will not be able to take you up on your very, very kind offer.</p>
      <p>"P.S. The irony isn't lost on me, as I normally come up to Aberdeen and put your lights out!'"</p>
