      <p><b>George Foreman, legendary boxer, has revealed that he never wanted to meet fellow American boxing great Mike Tyson in a boxing bout</b>.</p>
      <p>A two-time heavyweight champion Foreman won his first title after knocking out the then-undefeated Joe Frazier in 1973.</p>
      <p>After two successful defence of his title, Big George, as Foreman is popularly known, lost the world title to Muhammad Ali in 1974 in the famous Rumble In Jungle.</p>

      <p><i>"If he missed you with his left, then missed you with his right, he'd bite you. I didn't want anything to do with that guy. He was scared and I was glad of that. I didn't want a part of Mike Tyson," </i>he said.</p>
      <p>Despite his fear of Tyson, Big George also revealed an admiration for Tyson's skills saying: <i>“His footwork was outstanding and he could hit you very quickly. In his prime there was nothing like him.”</i></p>
