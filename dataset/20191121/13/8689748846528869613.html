      <p>BET award winning artist, Stonebwoy has  reacted to wild claims that he deliberately omits Kelvynboy’s part in their smash hit, ‘Kpoo Keke’ during his stage performance since his beef with him started.</p>
      <p>Stonebwoy, born Livingstone Etse Satekla said there’s no hidden motive behind that decision and finds it hard to believe that Ghanaians always concoct stories to attribute it to every situation.</p>
      <p>He told MzGee on 3FM that if he performs the entire duration of the song, he would not have enough time to perform the rest since all artists are given a timeframe on stage.</p>
      <p>Here’s what he said:<b>“oo, sometimes i don’t get some people oo, it seems people just sit down and want to set an agenda. The Kpo K3k3 song is more than 4 minutes long and i’ve been given just 10 minutes to perform on stage.”</b></p>
      <p>He added: <b>Because i want to perform my other songs too, so i always perform the first-two verses of Kpo k3k3 and i move on to my other songs, if you realised, i always perform up to Medikal’s verse then i move on to my other songs.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Even Kelvyn Boy’s verse is the last verse on the song, if i have to perform the full song, then i won’t have enough time to perform my other songs, and that’s it.”</b>
