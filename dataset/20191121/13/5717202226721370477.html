      <h1>Arsenal star Rob Holding delivers verdict on Tottenham sacking Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:15:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/SkySportsPL/status/1197197920224702465">Rob Holding has told Sky Sports</a> that Tottenham Hotspur’s appointment of Jose Mourinho as Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement will not affect Arsenal, but did state that he was shocked by the departure of the Argentine manager.</p>
      <p>Spurs swapped their manager in the space of a few hours between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Mourinho has since signed a contract that will keep him at Spurs until the summer of 2022/23.</p>
      <p>The swap comes after a dreadful start to the 2019-20 campaign. Spurs sit in a lowly 14th place after winning only three of their 12 league games, and have already been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Colchester United.</p>
      <p>The decision to sack Pochettino has rocked the footballing world and Arsenal star Holding was asked about the switch, claiming he was surprised to see Pochettino leave – but that he is unbothered by the appointment of Mourinho.</p>

      <p>“Last night, when I heard that they had sacked him, I was shocked,” <a href="https://twitter.com/SkySportsPL/status/1197197920224702465">Holding said.</a> “But that’s it from my side. It doesn’t affect me in any way. It doesn’t affect Arsenal, we know what we need to do and we are going to concentrate on ourselves.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never spoken to the guy [Pochettino] personally. Tottenham are a big rival for us but he had them playing well. Football moves on, things change,” Holding said. Asked if he was bothered by Mourinho: “Not one bit. My focus is on Arsenal.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Should Arsenal have got Mourinho, before Spurs?</h3>
      <p>Unai Emery is coming under increasing pressure as Arsenal manager and it only seems as though it is going to end in one result – his sacking. The former PSG boss is doing little to show Arsenal fans why he deserves the role.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was linked with the Arsenal job and despite previously managing two of the Gunners’ biggest rivals, they really should have moved before Tottenham did. However, Spurs have a new gaffer, while Arsenal remain in the doldrums.</p>
