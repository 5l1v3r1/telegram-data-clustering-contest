      <p>In an extremely rare move, Intel has published a letter from a senior exec apologizing to customers and partners for ongoing delays in shipping its CPUs.</p>
      <p>The letter was signed by Intel executive vice president and GM of sales, marketing and communications, Michelle Johnston Holthaus. <br/><br/>"I'd like to acknowledge and sincerely apologize for the impact recent PC CPU shipment delays are having on your business and to thank you for your continued partnership," <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/intel-supply-letter-customers.pdf">she wrote</a>. <br/><br/>Intel flagged the letter as part of its supply update notice. "Although Intel is working hard to regain supply-demand balance, it remains a challenge," <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-supply-update/#gs.hg261b">it said</a>. <br/><br/>Holthaus said despite investments and best efforts to meet demand, Intel had not yet resolved the challenge. </p>
      <p>She said Intel had "invested record levels of capex" (capital expenditure) on boosting its 14nm wafer capacity at the same time as ramping up 10nm production. Intel <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-hits-10th-generation-core-with-10nm-ice-lake-launch/">unveiled its 10nm Ice Lake chips in May</a>.  <br/><br/><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/14277/intel-cpu-shortages-will-persist-throughout-q3-2019">Per AnandTech</a>, Intel warned investors in April that shortages would continue, despite its $1.5bn investment last year to boost 14nm fab output. In response, the chip giant prioritized manufacturing of high-end Xeon and Core i7/i9 over cheaper chips from its Atom, Celeron, and Pentium lines.</p>
      <p>Holthaus said besides the 14nm investments it was also "increasing our use of foundries to enable Intel's differentiated manufacturing to produce more Intel CPU products".<br/><br/>Naturally, she painted Intel's predicament as both good and bad news for the company in an era when PC shipments have been in sustained decline, with the exception of a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/pc-shipments-grow-in-q3-as-windows-10-refresh-cycle-continues/">recent bump due to the Windows 10 refresh cycle</a>.  <br/><br/>"The added capacity allowed us to increase our second-half PC CPU supply by double digits compared with the first half of this year," wrote Holthaus. <br/><br/>"However, sustained market growth in 2019 has outpaced our efforts and exceeded third-party forecasts. Supply remains extremely tight in our PC business where we are operating with limited inventory buffers."</p>
