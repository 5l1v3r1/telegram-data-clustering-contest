      <p>Queensland actress Deborah Mailman co-hosted Thursday night's ceremony for the first time, at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre.</p>
      <p><i>Buoyancy</i>, directed by Australian Rodd Rathjen, won the APSA for Best Youth Feature Film amid a series of premieres across the world.</p>
      <p>Mr Rathjen said it was his first feature film and focused on shining a light on human trafficking and modern slavery in Cambodia.</p>

      <p>"I read a report about what was going on a few years ago and I was just shocked and felt immense sadness for these men and boys whose voices had been forgotten and not heard," he said.</p>
      <p>"The film is about a young boy who's looking for independence and a new life outside Cambodia.</p>
      <p>"He runs away from home, is trafficked, tricked into crossing the Thailand border, enslaved on a trawler and has to work out how to escape."</p>
      <p>Mr Rathjen, who is from regional Victoria, said the film was set to premiere in France next week and had already screened in Australia, India, the United States and Turkey.</p>
      <p>He was in Los Angeles last week for Oscars pre-screenings.</p>

      <p>The film came to fruition after several years of hard work, including rigorous research.</p>
      <p>"There were lots of challenges including the language barrier, logistically filming on water, and only having 27 days to shoot it," Mr Rathjen said.</p>

      <p>"I don’t want to complain too much because the people in this film have lived through some dehumanising experiences and the challenges of making this film don’t compare.</p>
      <p>"But it was critical we researched to the extent we did and made it as authentic and real as possible."</p>
      <p>The APSAs - dubbed the "Oscars for the rest of the world" - <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53cux.html">will have a permanent home in Brisbane if lord mayor Adrian Schrinner has his way</a>.</p>
      <p>Cr Schrinner committed to locking in the major international awards for the River City long-term.</p>
      <p>"Previously it [awards ceremony] was held in other parts of the state, but permanently it will be here [in Brisbane] going forward," Cr Schrinner said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"We want Brisbane to continue to have a growing and thriving film industry, but to have these international awards right here in Brisbane is something incredibly important for our city.</p>
      <p>"Major events such as the Asia Pacific Screen Awards contribute $150 million into Brisbane’s economy and create thousands of local jobs for Queenslanders."</p>
