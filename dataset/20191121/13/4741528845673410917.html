      <h1>Jumia: Platform that holds the Ace in Africa </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:50:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/abiola-odutola/" target="_blank">Abiola Odutola</a></address>
      <p>It is not new that <b>online commerce</b> and financial technology in Nigeria is strengthened by the fast-growing youth population, expanding consumer power and increasing smartphone penetration. It is not also new that the current <a href="https://www.export.gov/article?id=Nigeria-E-Commerce">e-commerce</a> spending in Nigeria is estimated at about $20 billion, and is projected to reach $75 billion in revenues per annum by 2025.</p>
      <p><b>No doubt</b>, Jumia has played a major role in positioning the nation’s e-commerce industry on the global spot and is pushing harder.</p>
      <h3>Where it all started</h3>
      <p><b>The journey began</b> when Jumia broke all limitations as it started operations in Lagos in 2012 as the pioneer e-commerce platform in Nigeria. From ground zero, <a href="https://www.export.gov/article?id=Nigeria-E-Commerce">Jumia</a> now operates in over 13 African countries, with over 5,000 workers on its payroll.</p>

      <p><b>In 2016, the venture-funded company</b> reached a billion-dollar valuation and reported revenues of $149.6 million in 2018. In April 2019, Jumia listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at a valuation of $1.1 billion and recorded surge in sales arising from its NYSE debut. From then on, the company set a pace for its counterparts to follow.</p>
      <h3>Latest Figures behind Jumia’s success</h3>
      <p><b>The leading African e-commerce company</b> grew the number of orders on its platform in the third quarter of 2019 by 95% on a year-on-year basis. Its Annual Active Consumers for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2019, also grew by 56%. Those are figures not many counterparts can boast of.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Nairametrics found that</b> Jumia’s Orders increased from 3.6 million in the third quarter of 2018 to 7.0 million in the third quarter of 2019. The <b>growth</b> outpaces its gross merchandise value (GMV) growth as a result of consumers purchasing an increasing amount of everyday product categories, which are typically lower average value items, on a more frequent basis.</p>
      <h3>What it means</h3>
      <p><b>The development</b>, which was disclosed in the firm’s <a href="https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jumia-Q3-Report.pdf">Q3’19 result</a>, means the brand witnessed significant progress in the patronage and relevance of its platform by both consumers and sellers.</p>
      <h3>Q2’19 vs Q3’19</h3>
      <p>The number of its <b>Active Consumers</b> increased from 4.8 million as the end of <a href="https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jumia-Q2-Report-1.pdf">Q2’19</a> to 5.5 million at the end of Q3’19. This corresponds to a quarterly net addition of approximately 636,000 consumers compared to a quarterly net addition of approximately 300,000 consumers over the same period.</p>
      <h3>Facts behind the figures</h3>
      <p><b>Nairametrics attributes </b>the growth to some categories in its kit. They are:</p>
      <h3>JumiaPay</h3>
      <p>One of them is its <b>JumiaPay</b> mobile application. When Jumia started off, one of the major challenges faced by the company was that of payments. In 2016, statistics had it that about 70% of orders made on the platform were paid for via “Pay on Delivery”. This was why Jumia introduced the JumiaPay payment initiative in 2016.</p>

      <p><b>JumiaPay is a third-party</b> online payment solution that the company assures will provide a safer, faster and more convenient online payment experience for its users.</p>
      <p><b>JumiaPay partners banks</b> to provide a secured option of payments where <b>patrons are</b> reimbursed instantly if anything goes wrong with his order (late arrival, damaged order, order doesn’t match website description etc). JumiaPay has spread its tentacles to six African major markets – Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya.</p>
      <p><b>No doubt</b>, the growth witnessed in the consumers’ base is a reflection of its continuous efforts to boost the visibility of relevant products and services and consistently enhancing buyers’ experience</p>
      <p><b>The marketplace revenue</b> of the continental brand grew from 17.5 million Euro in Q2’19 to 18.9 million by Q3’19, an increase of 8%. The total revenue of the company also rose from 39.2 million Euro in Q2’19 to 40.1 by the end of September 2019.</p>
      <p><b>Jumia’s Total Payment Volume</b> (TPV) rose by 23.07% from 26 million Euro in Q2’19 to 32 million Euro by the end of Q3’19. That is not all. Findings disclosed that JumiaPay transactions also grew by 16.6% from 1.8 million Euro in Q2’19 to 2.1 million Euro by Q3’19.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>What it means</h3>
      <p><b>The development means</b> there was an increase in the penetration of JumiaPay transactions on the platform, which also affected the brand’s payment value, as its TPV represented 11.6% of GMV in the third quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p><b>The increased penetration</b> was driven by a combination of continuous enlightenment on the platform and incentives such as capped cashback offered to consumers for the usage of JumiaPay.</p>
      <p><b>Jumia Lending is a new initiative</b> that gives you the opportunity to grow and expand your business by granting you access to fast and easy short term working capital. For now, loans are only available through Jumia One’s <a href="https://app.adjust.com/7i2txnz?deep_link=jumiaoneapp://">Android app</a>.</p>
      <p><b>While Nigerian Small </b>and Medium Enterprises await the activation in the most populous black nation, their counterparts in Kenya are already enjoying the initiative.</p>
      <p><b>In Kenya</b>, sellers received loans of up to 30,000 Kenyan shillings (roughly $290), with a six-month term on the loan to finance their businesses. Interest rates on the loans are 1.2% per month. The loans are made available in seconds on the Branch app and are disbursed through M-Pesa.</p>
      <h3>What Jumia says…</h3>
      <p><b>Assuring investors of a brighter future</b>, Co-Chief Executive Officers, Sacha Poignonnec and Jeremy Hodara, explained that the brand is making significant progress in the usage and relevance of its platform for consumers and sellers and firmly positioning Jumia as the digital destination of choice for everyday needs in Africa.</p>
      <p><b>Sacha said</b>, <i>“In parallel, we continue to make great strides in our payment and fintech business with JumiaPay showing very strong growth momentum on both volume and transaction metrics.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Our financial strategy seeks to balance growth, JumiaPay development, monetization and cost efficiencies. We manage this equation on a dynamic basis and are now placing even greater emphasis on cash discipline and efficiency.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Our growth strategy favours business verticals and product categories that drive adoption, repeat purchase and usage. On the cost efficiency front, we continuously seek to optimize our portfolio of assets and geographies to ensure efficient capital allocation. We are confident this strategy will enhance our focus on our core assets and contribute to building a healthy foundation for the long-term growth and success of Jumia.”</i>
