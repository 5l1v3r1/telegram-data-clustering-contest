        <b>There was a startling shower of crisp currency notes from the sixth floor of a building in Kolkata when the members of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence or DRI were conducting a drive at a private office on that floor.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident happened when passersby noticed someone struggling to get rid of bundles of Indian currencies through the sixth floor window of the building at the cityâ€™s Bentinck Street on Wednesday, according to local media.</p>
      <p>A video of the incident that has been circulating on social media shows a man from inside a window of the office desperately trying to clear bundles of notes with a sweeper onto the street.</p>
      <p>Soon after, as the notes started raining down, there was chaos in the area and people rushed to get hold of their share of free cash.</p>
      <p>DRI sources told Press Trust of India (PTI) that its sleuths had gone to the office of a private company engaged in export-import activities located on that floor to conduct search operations for alleged evasion of duty.</p>
      <p>However, it cannot be definitely said that there was a relation between the search operations and the shower of currency notes on the street below, the sources replied when asked.</p>
      <p>Police said investigations into the incident are underway.</p>
