      <p>Host of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> spin-off It Takes Two Zoe Ball was forced to apologise to viewers after technical issues meant that Wednesday night's show was taken off air.</p>
      <p>The incident happened during a chat with Alex Scott and her professional partner Neil Jones.</p>
      <p>As the sound cut, viewers could faintly hear Zoe speaking to a bemused-looking Alex and Neil.</p>

      <p>When it finally did go back to the studio, Zoe said: "I've got to apologise, we had sound problems, we lost you for a little bit."</p>
      <p>And, in order to finish her interview, footballer Alex had to answer directly into a hand-held microphone.</p>
