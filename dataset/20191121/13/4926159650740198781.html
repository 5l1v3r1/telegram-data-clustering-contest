      <h1>Jemimah Rodrigues rises to No. 4 in T20I batting rankings; three Indian bowlers in top five</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:40:45+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author">ESPNcricinfo staff</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/883405.html">Jemimah Rodrigues</a> has broken into the top five of the T20I batting rankings, moving up from seventh to fourth after compiling 96 runs during India's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/scores/series/19588/india-women-in-wi-2019-20">five-nil</a> mauling of West Indies. Her most significant contribution came in the final match, in which she struck a half-century.</p>
      <p>Following the result, India and West Indies swapped places, with India climbing to fourth after gaining eight points and West Indies dropping to fifth place, after losing ten points. To cap India's dominance in the rankings, left-arm spinner <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/960737.html">Radha Yadav</a> climbed from fifth to second after picking seven wickets in the series, just second behind offspinner <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/597811.html">Deepti Sharma</a>, who took eight wickets to hold on to her fourth place. With legspinner <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/630972.html">Poonam Yadav</a> ranked five, India are well represented.</p>
      <p>Fifteen-year old opener <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/1182523.html">Shafali Verma</a>, too, climbed in the rankings, leapfrogging from 87 to 30 after finishing the series as the <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=13389;type=series">highest run-getter</a> with a tally of 157, which included two fifties.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Pakistan batter Javeria Khan broke into the top 20 in T20Is after amassing 111 runs in the 3-0 thrashing of Bangladesh at home. But Bangladesh themselves had something to cheer about as fast bowler Jahanara Alam, who took nine wickets in the series, climbed 22 spots to 15th.</p>
