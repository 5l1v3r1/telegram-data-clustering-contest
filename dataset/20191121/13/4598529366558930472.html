      <p>Ed MacMahon, attorney for indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, said that his client helped arrange meetings and interviews for Rep. Devin Nunes’ (R-CA) “investigations” in Europe in 2018.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/remote-surgery-is-coming-to-a-hospital-near-you?ref=scroll">According to the Daily Beast,</a> Nunes traveled around Europe with a coterie of aides from November 30 to December 3, costing $63,000 in government funds.</p>
      <p>It is not clear exactly what the investigations entailed, but the trip coincided with Nunes’ mania about discrediting the Mueller probe.</p>
      <p>Nunes has just as ardently been trying to undermine the impeachment inquiry, reiterating day after day that it’s a Democratic “circus” born out of nothing more than hate for President Donald Trump. He has also infused the process with a steady stream of hard-to-decipher conspiracy theories, including the bogus notion that Ukraine — and not Russia — meddled in the 2016 election on Hillary Clinton’s, not Trump’s, behalf.</p>
