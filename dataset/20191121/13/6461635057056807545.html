      <h1>6 possible destinations for Barcelona legend Lionel Messi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:52:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">Nishant Narayanan</a></address>
      <h3>Barca’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, recently confirms that Barcelona are ​talking with Lionel Messi over a new contract that will see the Argentine finish his career at the Camp Nou.</h3>
      <p>Lionel Messi has a clause in his current contract at Barcelona that allows him to leave the Blaugrana for free next summer. He previously renewed his contract in 2017 but had added a clause allowing him to leave in 2021 due to his desire to return to Argentina.</p>
      <p>The Argentine is currently in his 16th season with Blaugrana, having joined the Spanish Champions in 2001, making his competitive debut in 2004.</p>
      <p>The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has recently mentioned his desires to remain in Catalonia and thus discussion of a “Lifetime contract” has begun to ensure that the G.O.A.T sees out his playing days at FC Barcelona.</p>
      <p>That being said, many speculate that Lionel Messi may eventually move on from Catalonia, just like fellow club legends such as Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta did despite having an option of a lifelong contract.</p>
      <p>Here are possible destinations for the Barca captain in case the maestro ever decides to leave the Spanish giants,</p>

      <h4>#6 Inter Miami</h4>
      <p>Inter Miami are a new club that will join MLS in 2020 and football legend David Beckham who heads the ownership of the club wants to bring Lionel Messi to Miami.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-beckham-plots-move-for-lionel-messi-kjzdw7sgf"><b>The Times</b></a> state that the English superstar wants to bring the Argentine maestro to his club before their debut in the American League.</p>
      <p>As for the club, this will be the biggest statement signing in MLS history but for Messi, this could be a new challenge with a team without a history.</p>
      <p>Messi’s latest contract extension values the player’s buyout clause at £626 million pounds, but even then Inter Miami are the most likely MLS side to sign the Argentine.</p>

      <h4>#5 Manchester United</h4>
      <p>Manchester United are one of the highest-earning clubs in the World and would have the financial support to manage a huge signing like Lionel Messi.</p>
      <p>The Premier League side are Ronaldo’s former club and that can also be a deciding factor because if Messi leads the current United squad to a title-contending spot against the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, and Spurs, fans around the world have to reassess their stand on the Argentine not proving himself outside of Spain.</p>
      <p>United will prove to be a tough challenge for the Barca captain as it is a squad that requires improvement in order to compete in the world’s most competitive football league, but if there is one player that can make a difference, it is Lionel Messi.</p>

      <h4>#4 Liverpool</h4>
      <p>Liverpool could be the perfect club for the Argentine international if he wants to try his talents in the Premier League. They had one of their best seasons by winning the Champions League beating Barca in the semi-finals, and now look to win the Premier League title against strong contenders Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s rivalry with Man United can also be another reason for the forward to bring success to Liverpool side over Ronaldo’s former club. Though The Reds can afford the Blaugrana captain, the player itself might find it difficult to adjust to the club.</p>

      <h4>#3 Inter Milan</h4>
      <p>This is the club for Messi if he wants to accept Ronaldo’s public challenge and join him in the Italian League, Serie A. Out of all the Italian teams, Inter Milan would be the likely ones to manage the financial resources required to capture the Argentine.</p>
      <p>The club are currently sitting on 2nd place in the league, only one point behind Ronaldo’s Juventus, proving to be the Barca Captain’s best chance of competing against Cristiano.</p>
      <p>The Italian side would be a step down from the quality at Catalonia but if the superstar leads the current Internazionale side to a Serie A title, Messi will be regarded as the greatest player to ever play, even more than what people already claim.</p>

      <h4>#2 Newell’s Old Boys</h4>
      <p>The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has previously stated his desire to play for his native club from Rosario, Newell’s Old Boys.</p>
      <blockquote>“I always said I wanted to play in Argentine football one day, I don’t know if it will happen but I have it in my mind.<br/><br/>“It would be at Newell’s, nowhere else. I would like to do that for at least six months, but you never know what will happen.”<br/><br/>Source: <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/lionel-messi-barcelona-future-latest-newells-old-boys-argentina-a8372856.html"><b>Independent</b></a></blockquote>
      <p>But as time has passed, Messi has seemingly lost this desire of returning to Argentina due to the aggressive passion and obsession of the Nation with football.</p>
      <blockquote>“I always say that I don’t want to leave here [Barcelona], I have no thoughts of ​​moving,” Messi told TyC Sports.<br/><br/>“I have the dream of being able to play for Newell’s in Argentina, but I don’t know if it’s really going to happen because I have a family that is ahead of my desire. I will try to convince the family because today we have to convince the children too.”</blockquote>

      <h4>#1 Manchester City</h4>
      <p>Manchester City are the most logical destination for Lionel as the club not only suits the Argentinian tactically but also reunites him with former Barca manager Pep Guardiola who lived his best career moments in the Nou Camp winning the Treble with the squad.</p>
      <p>The Argentine is also personally familiar with two city executives, Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain,  who are known for managing high financial demands since the takeover of Sheikh Mansour over City. The club will have no financial problems over the transfer and the wages for Messi.</p>
      <p>With Guardiola looking to acquire the only trophy that has evaded him at Manchester, The Champions League, Messi would be the only player in the world that can make that dream an instant reality. The arrival of the g.o.a.t will make arguably the world’s best football side, the superteam of the world.</p>
      <p>Which team would Messi choose if he ever decides to leave the Catalan giants?</p>
