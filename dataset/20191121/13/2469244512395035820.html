      <h1>Exeter is named most expensive burger city in the country and includes one that costs £54</h1>
      <h2>If you don't succeed your name appears on its Wall of Shame</h2>

      <p>The hunt for the best-value burger city has seen Exeter named as being the home of the most expensive burgers in the UK, including one that will set you back a whopping £54.</p>
      <p>Since the mid-2010s, more and more eateries, bars and gastropubs have been adding trendy burgers to their menus due to customer demand.</p>
      <p>Exeter is well-known for having a particularly large number of burger restaurants, not all of which have stood the test of time.</p>
      <p>It has now been named as the priciest city for a meat burger, with the average price coming in at £17.40, while Wolverhampton is a frugal burger lover’s paradise with the lowest average burger cost at £9.20 - a 87 per cent difference in price.</p>

      <p>Exeter's most expensive burger is the Burger as Big as your Face which is served up at The Pig and Pallet in Topsham.</p>
      <p>It consists of two 6oz beef patties, pulled pork, beef chuck, king bacon, pastrami, black pudding, onion rings, remoulade, swiss cheese, Big Jim’s BBQ Sauce, egg and pickles.</p>
      <p>If you eat the meal all by yourself, including the fries, pickles and slaw, your name and picture will be put on its Hall of Fame and you get a t-shirt to prove you completed the challenge.</p>
      <p>However, don't expect a free feed. The restaurant states you will not get the meal free no matter how fast you eat it.</p>
      <p>And if you don't succeed your name appears on its Wall of Shame. So far there are 13 people who have tried and failed the challenge.</p>
      <p>But on the Hall of Shame board is 11 people and among them is Marcus Davey who works as a chef at The Pig and Pallet.</p>

      <p>The burger was added to its menu just over a year ago, and Marcus, who is known as The Food Dude at the company, says not conquering the burger mountain was never an option.</p>
      <p>He admitted: "I was a bit sick afterwards. I did it in just under hour and I had friends with me and they were just like 'you animal'. I’m not a big eater but I had to do it to prove a point."</p>
      <p>Explaining how you get what you pay for when it comes to burgers, he said: “We champion local produce. We have to pay more for free range and organic ingredients which are closer to home.</p>
      <p>"One of our core beliefs is find the best and serve the best, and it does cost more for better things.</p>
      <p>“Our burgers come served with fries in a red basket, but you can pimp it up if you want to such as adding cheese."</p>

      <p>Exeter has also been named as the second worst value city for meat-free burgers at a cost of £13 - just 10p less than the worst city, Southampton.</p>
