      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:07:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Masebe Qina</a></address>
      <p>Chippa United have reshuffled the technical team at a crucial time, as teams prepare for the re-start of the Absa Premiership, after the FIFA international break. </p>
      <p>The Siya crew can confirm that Postnet Omony, who has been serving as the goalkeeper coach at the Chilli Boys, has been relieved of his duties today. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The former goalkeeper re-joined Chippa this season for a second stint, under the club’s ex-coach Clinton Larsen. </p>
      <p>The Ugandan previously had a stint as the goalkeeper coach at the Eastern Cape outfit, during the 2017/18 season under Serbian coach Vladislav Heric. </p>
      <p>Chippa, who are at the bottom of the log, have conceded 11 goals in 11 matches in the League so far this season. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Though some have pointed fingers at the team’s number one goalkeeper Patrick Tignyemb for some of the goals conceded, it would appear that Omony is the one who has been made to suffer the consequences for some of the notable schoolboy errors.    </p>
      <p>Contacted for comment, at first Omony was cautious about revealing all about the latest happenings at the Port Elizabeth club.      </p>
      <p>“I cannot confirm or deny it because nothing is on paper yet,” he told the Siya crew.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Upon further enquiries, the former Bloemfontein Celtic goalkeeper confirmed that the club’s general manager Wanda Mbenguzana broke the news to him this morning.</p>
      <p>“It’s just been a verbal notification from the GM of the club. Apparently, the coach (Norman Mapeza) is… I don’t know. He’s not comfortable with my presence,” confirmed Omony.</p>
      <p>Chippa are scheduled to host Black Leopards at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium next Wednesday in their next match.  </p>
