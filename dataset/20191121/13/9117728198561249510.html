        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull Racing</a> and Honda are in their first year of what they will hope will be a very successful relationship. They have won races and featured on the podium at a number of Grand Prix's. Christian Horner is very pleased with how things are going and hopes that his team will be genuine contenders next season. </b>

      <p><i>“I think in many respects it's been better than expected. There were a lot of questions as to why we had made the move to Honda,"</i> Horner said to<a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.honda-red-bull-relationship-better-than-expected-horner.13lLSVyxeb0WYC1z4rjtwD.html"><i> Formula1.com.</i></a></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I think very quickly, at the first Grand Prix, we achieved a podium. We’ve scored more points than we had at this time last year. All around, reliability has been strong, performance has been getting better and better.</i>

        <i>“I think on the chassis side we were affected more than we thought going into the year by the front wing regulation change and Honda have certainly exceeded our expectations in all areas. So, it has been a really very positive start to this partnership."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Many believe that if Honda can continue to develop over the winter, then Red Bull could be a threat to Mercedes and could be the team to end their dominance.</p>
