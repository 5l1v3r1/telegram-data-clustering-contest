      <h1>40 days left for Bekasi to generate Rp 1 trillion in local income, mayor says</h1>

      <p>The city administration of Bekasi in West Java has 40 days left until the end of the year to reach its locally generated income target of Rp 3.3 trillion (US$234 million). According to the Bekasi Local Income Agency, the city has only achieved Rp 2.2 trillion, or 71 percent of its target.</p>
      <p>“This is an executive matter and strategy that the agency has discussed. I want it to be optimized,” Bekasi Mayor Rahmat Effendi said on Wednesday, <i>tempo.co</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Rahmat said that if the local income was disrupted, Bekasi’s spending would have to be cut back. For the remainder of the budgetary year, Bekasi was therefore trying to add more income from several sources, including taxes and fines.</p>
      <p>“That’s why we must optimize it. We have 40 days left,” Rahmat said.</p>
      <p>He said income that could be tapped included billboard taxes, land and building taxes and restaurant taxes.</p>
      <p>Recently, Bekasi was under fire for cooperating with a local organization (ormas) to increase tax collection efforts.</p>
      <p>“[Parking] fees have already almost reached the target (Rp 6 billion),” Rahmat said.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the Bekasi administration and Bekasi Council discussed the city’s locally generated income target.</p>
      <p>“If the locally generated income drops, a lot of our spending will be in deficit,” Bekasi Council Commission 3 head Abdul Muin Hafidz said. (ami)</p>
