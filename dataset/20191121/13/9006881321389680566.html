      <p>You might think that <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/fitness/workouts/come-for-the-gram-stay-for-the-mindful-burn-bodylove-pilates-studio-review/news-story/6f0b3a18936bd31c55c040c7f4d0bfdb">a Pilates class</a> is somewhere you can wear any old activewear - but don't let the low-impact vibe of <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/fitness/workouts/let-us-convince-you-why-you-should-add-pilates-to-your-exercise-routine/news-story/b1e489ef9c00c71a44e6f7b2d3599d2d">this year's workout du jour</a> fool you. The <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/fitness/workouts/class-in-review-everything-to-know-about-lagree-meghan-markles-goto-exercise/news-story/8974af5d2a500a93a7b17c97e84cb930">precision of movement</a> that Pilates requires, coupled with the limb-lengthening movements means you need clothes with lots of stretch, but also that let's see what you're doing!</p>
      <p>Someone knows this all to well is Kirsten King, the founder and head instructor at Sydney-based <a href="https://www.fluidformpilates.com.au/">Fluidform Pilates</a> and Fluidform at Home. She backed our theory up, saying "It is important to be able to see muscles activating while practising Pilates so form-hugging is best. Leggings and a tank or fitted tee work well."</p>

      <p>And her personal workout uniform? "My Pilates wardrobe is functional and polished and consists of a lot of lululemon and P.E Nation."</p>
      <p>So that's a firm N-O to oversized tees, jogging shorts, and anything that isn't at least 95% Lyrca.</p>
      <p>To help get your Pilates gear <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/health/do-an-adele-and-drop-a-dress-size-with-pilates/news-story/7581242ffc5a4ddc43ab7c12d8524905">in the game</a>, we've found the best tights and tanks that will have you looking like a studio pro - even if it's your first class.</p>
      <p>Here's our edit of the most functional, and fashionable, co-ordinating sets around.</p>
      <h3>What: Print It Up crop and legging set ($178 at Nimble)</h3>
      <p><b>Why:</b> Sydney-based Nimble is known for their extra comfy leggings and high-cut styles that never dig in. This pretty print makes a nice change from the sporty motifs you often see in the studio.</p>

      <h3>What: Double block tank ($99, at <a href="https://pe-nation.com/double-block-tank-in-white/">P.E Nation</a>) and Alpine leggings ($149 at <a href="https://pe-nation.com/alpine-legging/">P.E Nation</a>)</h3>
      <p><b>Why:</b> Co-founder <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/fitness/fitness-gear/pip-edwards-reveals-exactly-what-it-takes-to-build-an-activewear-empire/news-story/bf2b3171994ab40ce7026290d7716ae5">Pip Edwards</a> is a keen Pilates-goer herself, so we know she would have put this set through the wringer. The side-stripe detailing helps to visually lengthen legs, and the tank can we worn tied at the back when you need to see that core engage, or undone if you prefer more coverage post-workout.</p>
