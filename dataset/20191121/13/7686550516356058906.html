      <p>Martin Lewis has revealed a tip which could save homeowners thousands on the cost of their home loans.</p>
      <p>"The UK and world economic uncertainty has a silver lining for mortgage holders," the Money Saving Expert wrote in his <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/latesttip/">newsletter</a> .</p>
      <p>That's because fixed-rate loans offered by banks are generally based on something called "swap rates", which try and predict where official interest rates will go in the future.</p>
      <p>And the weaker people think the economy will be, the lower they think Bank of England interest rates will be - which means cheap deals right now, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/martin-lewis-tells-everyone-home-20923531">Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>"Long-term interest rate forecasts are low right now, and these feed into the mortgage rates lenders offer," Martin said.</p>
      <p>He said the lowest two-year fixed-rate mortgage is just 1.05% at the moment, while there are five-year deals for 1.44%. That's the the lowest they've been since 2017.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There's even a deal right now for less than 1% - a two-year tracker charging just 0.98% interest.</p>
      <p>But lowest rate doesn't always mean cheapest when it comes to mortgages - with a whole host of other charges and factors meaning they might not be right for you.</p>
      <p>What the deals do illustrate, though, is where the market is heading.</p>
      <p>"These deals have specific terms, require decent equity and charge £1,000-ish fees, so they're not recommendations, more a totem of how competitive the market is," he said.</p>
      <p>"So everyone with a mortgage should check now if you can switch and save. The impact can be huge."</p>
      <p>Martin pointed to one money saver, who's just made a saving of £160 a month on a new five-year deal.</p>
      <p>"Nearly £10,000 saved over the fixed period. Wow," he tweeted to Martin.</p>
      <p>So how do you make sure you get the best deal?</p>
      <p>
        <b>You first need to find out:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your current rate plus monthly payments and outstanding debt</li>
        <li>Whether you're on a fix, tracker or standard variable rate</li>
        <li>When your deal expires and what rate will it go to after</li>
        <li>How long is left on the loan</li>
        <li>Are there penalties to leaving early and what they are</li>
        <li>What is your current LTV. This stands for loan-to-value, and effectively means how much of your home's worth your mortgage debt represents. For example, a £150,000 mortgage on a home worth £200,000 works out as an LTV of 75%.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your mortgage is due to end soon, or you're able to switch penalty-free now, ask your lender what its best deals are.</p>
      <p>If you stay with your current provider you might be able to save on fees - and even if you still decide to leave it gives you an benchmark number to beat.</p>
      <p>When looking for the cheapest deals, he said <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/redir/2c683e23">mortgage comparison</a> tool can work offer a benchmark of what's out there, but the "real key" is working out the best deal you'll actually be offered.</p>
      <p>That can depend on anything from the sort of house you have and your job, to your credit history and the lenders' specific affordability checks.</p>
      <p>That means using a mortgage broker can be a smart move - as they have information that's not publicly available on the mortgage provider's criteria.</p>
