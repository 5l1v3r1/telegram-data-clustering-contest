      <h2>Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford says the club must win trophies in this campaign - not just secure a place in next season's Champions League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:41:05+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:41</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Marcus Rashford says a top-four finish will not be enough for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> this season – with trophies the only measure of success.</p>
      <p>United are currently in seventh place in the Premier League, nine points off the Champions League places, after a mixed start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Reds endured their worst start to a league season for 33 years, but recovered with two wins in their last three games, to give themselves a fighting chance of a top-four place.</p>
      <p>But United and England striker Rashford said that would not constitute success for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, at a club where silverware is all that matters.</p>
      <p>"Manchester United have always got to chase trophies," said Rashford.</p>

      <p>"I think it's been 18 months [two-and-a-half years] since we won our last trophy, so it's been a while.</p>
      <p>"If we come out of this season with top-four but without a trophy, I wouldn't be happy.</p>
      <p>"If we manage to get some trophies and get ourselves into the top-four, then, of course, it's been a successful season.</p>
      <p>"For me it's just about putting markers down for what we can do in the future, because we know this period is not going to change overnight, Ole's not going to get what he wants overnight.</p>
      <p>"We have to bide our time and just be patient, as long as we keep working hard and believe in what we're doing - which I think the team do 100 per cent - then I think we will be fine."</p>
      <p>Rashford, 22, ended speculation over his United future in July by singing a new four-year contract worth a basic salary of £250,000-a-week.</p>
      <p>The forward, back to his best with nine goals in his last 10 games for club and country, hailed Solskjaer as the right man to rebuild United and take them back to the top, despite the availability of Mauricio Pochettino, following his dismissal by <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"There was no hesitation from me over signing a new contract," Rashford told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"And it was the same for Ole as well - I could see where his head was at, where he wanted the club to be at and for me it was just a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>"We were on the same page and wanted the same things for the club. Ole is a great guy and he has the club's interests at heart so there's not a better person for the job in my opinion."</p>
