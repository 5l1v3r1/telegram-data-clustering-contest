      <p>Motorists who want to do their Christmas shopping downtown Penticton next month will enjoy free parking on Saturdays.</p>
      <p>City council this week approved no-charge street parking downtown on all four Saturdays in December. The municipality has run a similar program for the past several years, at request of the Downtown Penticton Association. </p>
      <p>The city says waiving the parking fees will cost them about $5,000 in lost revenue. </p>
      <p>A motion by Mayor John Vassilaki at Tuesday’s council meeting to have free transit on the same days failed, after a majority of councillors decided they wanted more information on the idea and will consider it next year. </p>
      <p>Chief financial officer Jim Bauer said free transit would have cost the city an estimated less than $1,800 per day.</p>
