        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 21 – Plans are underway to convene both State and non-state actors to discuss new measures to tame rising cases of violence against women and children which the Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi Thursday described as a national security threat.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The CS said rampant killings have left a disjointed society living in fear.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>He said there was need for a candid discussion on the emotive topic in order to come up with probable solutions.</p>
      <p>“Something has gone wrong. There’s no way we can continue this way,” Matiangi said.</p>
      <p>“What kind of men are we raising? Have we become such an animal society that we’re feeding on our wives and children?”</p>
      <p>His sentiments came days after a senior military officer was identified as the key suspect in the brutal murder of his wife and strangled s two children, latest in a series of similar harrowing incidents.</p>
      <p>Major Peter Mugure, still in police custody pending the conclusion of a police investigation, is accused of killing his 31-year-old Joyce Syombua and two kids aged 5 and 10 and proceeded to bury them in a shallow grave in Laikipia County.</p>
      <p>The three went missing on October 26 after visiting Mugure.</p>
      <p>In yet another incident, a newspaper journalist was stabbed to death at a female police officer’s home in a suspected case of a love triangle.</p>
      <p>“We cannot go on this way. We must look for a solution to this problem,” Matiangi asserted.</p>
      <p>“We need to have a candid, national conversation on this matter.”</p>
      <p>Matiangi said the interior ministry was already working on measures to make police stations friendly especially to children to encourage reporting of incidents.</p>
      <p>He also called for candid conversations on mental health which is partly attributed to rising cases of violence.</p>
      <p>“There is the issue of mental health that we need to address in the society. We need to have a serious national conversation. There is no way we can move forward as a country with the level of violence we are witnessing around. It is totally unacceptable,” he said.</p>
      <p>The CS was speaking during the inaugural Senior Women’s Conference at the Kenya Prison Training College located in Ruiru, within Kiambu County.</p>
      <p>He urged religious institutions to take up the challenge and help the government to address any outstanding issues.</p>
      <p>The conference was attended by four other Cabinet Secretaries – Prof Margaret Kobia of Public Service, Youth and Gender, her Defence counterpart Raychelle Omamo, Faridah Karoney of Lands and Monica Juma (Foreign Affairs).</p>
      <p>The CSs urged women in the security sector to angle themselves for leadership positions while striving to uphold the highest level of integrity.</p>
