      <p>Anyone who fancies a weekend of boarding up windows, barricading trapdoors and "Fuzing" hapless hostages should jump on board Ubisoft's tactical shooter <i>Rainbow Six Siege</i>, which is holding a free-to-play weekend ahead of the launch of new season <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../rainbow-six-siege-shifting-tides-video-spotlights-operators-kali-and-wamai-572058.phtml">Operation Shifting Tides</a>, expected within the next week or two.<br/><br/>You and your buddies can jump in on the twitchy action from today until November 24 gratis. Should you get a taste for all the rappelling, crawling and not-knowing-what-you-did-wrong action, then the full game is available at various levels of discount, some ranging all the way up to 70% off. Any progress made during the weekend will, of course, carry over into the main purchase.</p>

      <p>I jest about <i>Rainbow Six Siege</i> frequently, but I genuinely think its an excellent game. It's undeniably little rough around the edges - and it definitely takes a little commitment to get the pace, tactics and teamwork down - but when it all comes together, it can be a very exciting and satisfying experience. Just keep your hands off my girl N0kk, I'm nothing without her.<br/><br/><i>Rainbow Six Siege</i> is available now on PS4, PC and Xbox One. You can find out more about Operation Shifting Tides, its new operators, map rework and other features on the <a href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-gb/game-info/seasons/shiftingtides/index.aspx"><i>Rainbow Six Siege</i> website.</a></p>
