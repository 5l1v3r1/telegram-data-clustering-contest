        <i>Andy Anokye imprisoned and repeatedly assaulted four women, Bristol court hears</i>
      </p>
      <p>A musician imprisoned and repeatedly raped four young women, often filming the alleged attacks, a jury has been told.</p>
      <p>Andy Anokye, 32, who performs under the stage name Solo 45, denies 31 charges against him covering a two-year period.</p>
      <p>Judge William Hart told jurors at Bristol crown court that Anokye was a member of the grime collective Boy Better Know.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Christopher Quinlan QC described Anokye as a violent and controlling narcissist and a bully. “He imprisoned, assaulted, sexually violated and raped four women,” said Quinlan.</p>
      <p>“You will hear from each of them during the course of this trial. Each suffered in similar ways at different times at the defendant’s hands. He filmed, using his mobile phone, a great deal of what he did.”</p>
      <p>Quinlan said one of the women reported the abuse to friends and then to police.</p>
      <p>Anokye was arrested and his mobile phone and laptop were seized by officers, who contacted three other women.</p>
      <p>“What they disclosed to police is reflected by the 31 charges,” Quinlan said. “We allege that these charges reflect his conduct and his treatment of these four young women.</p>
      <p>“He physically assaulted and falsely imprisoned them, held them against their will and he raped each of them repeatedly.</p>
      <p>“He is a sadist who derives satisfaction and sexual pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering on his victims.”</p>
      <p>Quinlan said Anokye will claim that any sexual activity between him and the women was consensual.</p>
      <p>The jury heard Anokye is a grime artist, with Quinlan describing the genre as “dance music influenced by garage music. Artists of that genre include Skepta and Stormzy”. “Neither has anything to do with this case but you may hear reference to either or both of them during the evidence,” he added.</p>
      <p>The charges, relating to four complainants, include 22 counts of rape and five counts of false imprisonment. Anokye is also accused of two charges of assault by penetration and two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>He denies all 31 charges against him and the trial continues.</p>
