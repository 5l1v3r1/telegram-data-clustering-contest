      <p>Nasa has released a picture of two galaxies ‘battling’ way out in deep space.</p>
      <p>The two spiral star systems look a little bit our own Milky Way, which is also doomed to wage its own cosmic war against a neighbour galaxy.</p>
      <p>‘What’s happening to these spiral galaxies?’ Nasa asked.</p>
      <p>‘Although details remain uncertain, there sure seems to be a titanic battle going on.’</p>
      <p>The upper galaxy is called UGC 1810, but is also named Arp 273 when considered part of one large system along with its sparring partners.</p>
      <p>‘The overall shape of the UGC 1810 – in particular its blue outer ring – is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions,’ Nasa added.</p>
      <p>‘The blue colour of the outer ring at the top is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.</p>

      <p>‘The inner part of the upper galaxy – itself an older spiral galaxy – appears redder and threaded with cool filamentary dust.</p>

      <p>‘A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to colliding galaxies, while several far-distant galaxies are visible in the background.’</p>
      <p>Arp 273 lies about 300 million light-years away towards the constellation of Andromeda.</p>
      <p>It’s ‘quite likely’ that UGC 1810 will ‘devour its galactic sidekicks over the next billion years and settle into a classic spiral form’.</p>
      <p>At some point in the future, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/15/andromeda-galaxy-going-eat-milky-way-astronomers-reveal-new-predictions-7314404/">our galaxy will plough into Andromeda</a> and form a massive new star system.</p>
      <p>Scientists have worked out how long we’ve got until the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/01/beautiful-picture-grim-warning-fate-humanitys-home-galaxy-7596757/">Milky Way smashes into a neighbouring galaxy</a> – and you don’t need to be too worried just yet.</p>
      <p>It’s now believed this will happen in 4.5 billion years time, rather than 3.9 billion years into the future.</p>
      <p>Astronomers used data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia satellite to study the movements of Andromeda.</p>

      <p>They said the collision will happen later than expected and will also be ‘less destructive’, with the two galaxies hitting each other in a ‘glancing blow’ rather than a head-on collision.</p>
      <p>‘This finding is crucial to our understanding of how galaxies evolve and interact,” says Timo Prusti, ESA Gaia Project Scientist.</p>
      <p>So what will happen when Andromeda hits the Milky Way?</p>
      <p>With both galaxies made up of more than 100 billion stars, you might think that the collision will be explosive.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But it’s believed that gap between stars is so huge that the actual number of collisions is likely to be small.</p>
      <p>However, the stellar dance caused by this cosmic carve-up will still be very dramatic.</p>
      <p>The gravitational chaos caused when the two galaxies begin to interact with each other will throw stars out of their orbit and into a huge swirl.</p>
      <p>It’s likely the two galaxies would then settle down to form a new galaxy.</p>
      <p>Our own solar system would probably survive this process, although it seems unlikely that humanity will be around to see it.</p>
