      <h3>More people should mean more teachers</h3>
      <p>The front page of the Regina Leader-Post on Nov. 15 featured two interesting, newsworthy articles — and yet contradicting one another — that were printed side by side.</p>
      <p>The first article, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/sask-teachers-declare-impasse-ask-for-conciliation">Teachers seek conciliation as contract talks falter</a>, stated the Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation (STF) declared an impasse in bargaining for a new contract, as the government refuses to budge on class-size demands. The minister of education warned it would lead to “chaos in the classrooms”. Perhaps the minister of education is correct, but he did not provide an explanation to his comment, nor did he provide a solution to the teacher’s concerns.</p>
      <p>The second article, titled Moe enlists Harper to help boost exports, stated that the government’s plan is to increase the population of the province to 1.4 million people while adding 100,000 new jobs.</p>
      <p>People who come to settle in Saskatchewan are families with children. Children need schools and as expected, the province would have educated itself to add more classroom space and teachers to accommodate the newcomers.</p>
      <p>This is when I found myself totally confused, wondering if our current politicians really know what they are talking about. It is either that or our politicians do not communicate well with one another on how to run the affairs of the province.</p>
      <p>The clear and present danger this fact reflects has much to do with whether our current politicians really care about the benefits of the people who elected them, or care more about having their names printed on the front page of the daily paper.</p>
      <p>Either way or as a caring citizen of this province, I better educate myself well enough on whom to vote for in the next election.</p>

      <h3>Liberals not showing much humility</h3>
      <p>When I first started to read <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/how-to-make-progress-on-prairie-priorities">Ralph Goodale’s opinion editorial</a> (Nov. 16), I had some hope that he and the federal Liberals may have learned some humility. Unfortunately, the editorial simply reinforced the attitudes that led western voters to reject the Liberals in the first place.</p>
      <p>Overall, the editorial takes a patronizing tone. Western voters, the editorial contends, simply need to be taught that the carbon tax is good for them. Instead of being angry at the Liberals’ anti-pipeline Bills C-69 and C-48, voters should be grateful for the minor, reluctant efforts the Liberals made to build pipelines. When it comes to the unfair equalization structure, the editorial tries to blame it on previous governments. As well, the editorial makes the slightest nod to ending divisiveness and working co-operatively, but then promptly dives into explicitly partisan attacks.</p>
      <p>The editorial suggests that western interests would be better served if they had representation in the Liberal government. We had that representation in the Trudeau government’s first term, yet they proved ineffective at defending Western Canada. Why would voters reward incompetence?</p>
      <p>The editorial is premised on self-reflection, but there is no evidence of it. Self-reflection involves asking the tough questions “What did I do wrong? How can I change?” Instead, the editorial arrogantly suggests that the voters were foolish to punish the Liberals and need to be taught some gratitude.</p>
      <p>It is clear from this tone that we can expect no better from the current Liberal government than we received from the last one.</p>
