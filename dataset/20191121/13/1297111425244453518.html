      <h1>Rob Vanstone: Saskatchewan Roughriders should retain Stephen McAdoo</h1>
      <h2>Although the Roughriders failed to score a touchdown in Sunday's West final, offensive co-ordinator Stephen McAdoo should be retained.</h2>

      <p>The intent here is not to give<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-trusts-in-stephen-mcadoos-offensive-philosophy"> Stephen McAdoo</a> a free pass — although it would probably hit the crossbar, anyway.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-poor-play-calling-was-the-saskatchewan-roughriders-undoing">Saskatchewan Roughriders’ offensive co-ordinator has been widely criticized for his perplexing play-calling i</a>n Sunday’s CFL West Division final, won 20-13 by the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</p>
      <p>But one bad game, irrespective of its importance, should not nullify what McAdoo accomplished during the 2019 season as a whole.</p>
      <p>With McAdoo as the chief offensive strategist, Saskatchewan finished first in the West with a 13-5 record. The victory total was the Roughriders’ best in nearly half a century.</p>
      <p>Unlike last year, the Roughriders did not earn a home playoff game on the strength of a formidable defence.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan scored 44 offensive touchdowns, an increase of 19 from the previous season.</p>
      <p>In terms of offensive points, the Roughriders were fourth in the league, with 440 — only eight fewer than the second-ranked Montreal Alouettes.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders proficiency on offence was such that <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/football-comes-first-for-the-family-of-saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo">Cody Fajardo</a>, a first-year starting quarterback, was named the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/quarterback-cody-fajardo-named-saskatchewan-roughriders-most-outstanding-player">West’s most outstanding player.</a></p>
      <p>Shaq Evans, who caught 72 passes for 1,334 yards, emerged as one of the league’s elite receivers.</p>
      <p>All of this happened on McAdoo’s watch.</p>
      <p>So did Sunday’s short-yardage short-circuits.</p>
      <p>McAdoo should not be absolved of criticism for the controversial calls. But let’s not get carried away, either.</p>
      <p>What to do with McAdoo?</p>
      <p>Severing ties with him is not the answer — although, based on the tenor of fan feedback that has been received at this cluttered work station, my view is not an especially popular one.</p>
      <p>Remember that there was also a clamour for McAdoo’s ouster a year ago, following a season in which Saskatchewan eked out a league-worst 25 offensive TDs.</p>
      <p>An outcry over his play selection was the exception in 2019. It was reminiscent of 2017, when Saskatchewan led the league in touchdown passes (35) while using quarterbacks Kevin Glenn and Brandon Bridge.</p>
      <p>Nobody seemed to mind McAdoo’s work in 2017. This past regular season, his name was seldom uttered by fans and members of the media when the Roughriders’ offence was purring.</p>
      <p>Then came Sunday, when everything came unravelled and many fans came unglued — feeling McAdoo’ed.</p>
      <p>Now we await the results of the Roughriders’ appraisal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-moving-on-after-west-division-final-loss">Head coach Craig Dickenson</a> hopes to have his staff solidified by the end of 2019. Does he want McAdoo to return? Would McAdoo like to be back? We do not know.</p>
      <p>This much is certain: Dickenson is very loyal, and seldom (if ever) punitive.</p>
      <p>He will tolerate mistakes, as long as they do not recur.</p>
      <p>He will delegate authority more liberally than many head coaches. The formula clearly works, as evidenced by the fact that he is the West’s coach of the year.</p>
      <p>So if he throws McAdoo overboard, what kind of message would that convey?</p>
      <p>Dickenson is certainly within his rights to insist that there must never be a reprise of Sunday.</p>
      <p>And he will demand that of himself, following yet another clock-management error near the end of the first half.</p>
      <p>As much as Dickenson accomplished in 2019, continued failure to win a playoff game will not suffice — not with the 2020 Grey Cup game ticketed for Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>“Sustained success” is the mantra of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rider-rumblings-75-craig-reynolds-on-cfl-attendance-and-finishing-first">Roughriders president-CEO Craig Reynolds.</a></p>
      <p>Fajardo, a franchise quarterback, is a tremendous cornerstone for a team that aspires to be a perennial powerhouse.</p>
      <p>He is so enamoured with Rider Nation that he signed a contract extension before season’s end, as opposed to testing free agency in February.</p>
      <p>His return will give Saskatchewan much-needed continuity on offence. In his second year as a CFL starting quarterback, one can only imagine what he will accomplish.</p>
      <p>McAdoo’s system is clearly compatible with the starting quarterback’s talents. Why mess with success?</p>
      <p>Fajardo threw for 366 yards on Sunday despite playing with two torn oblique muscles. He was one completion away from likely sending the game into overtime.</p>
      <p>The final pass, aimed toward Kyran Moore, bounced off the crossbar — whereupon the Blue Bombers rejoiced and an anguished Fajardo crumpled to the turf.</p>
      <p>The end of the game was also the ignition for members of the “Fire McAdoo” movement.</p>
      <p>Their disappointment is understandable. Their logic, less so.</p>
