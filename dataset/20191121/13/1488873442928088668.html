      <p><a href="https://parsec-accelerator.eu/applicants/">The PARSEC Accelerator</a> is inviting SMEs, startups and aspiring founders keen to develop innovative services for the Food, Energy or Environment sectors to apply to its first Open Call, seeking to fuel these innovations with data from Earth Observation satellites.</p>
      <p>Applications will be open until the 20<sup>th</sup> of December 2019 at 5pm CET.

Winners will get the chance to proceed to the second stage, where up to €50.000 (per participant) and further support will be made available.</p>
      <p>The PARSEC Accelerator aims to <a href="https://parsec-accelerator.eu/2019/11/21/innovation-fuelled-by-earth-observation-what-it-means-for-your-business/">fuel innovation with Earth Observation data</a> collected by satellites. Thanks to new, maturing and converging technologies such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, as well as the recent NewSpace phenomenon, the Earth Observation sector is currently going through a period of rapid evolution. On top of this, an incredible amount of free and open satellite data is available thanks to the European Union’s Copernicus programme. Its dedicated Sentinel satellite generate over 1,5 terabytes of data every day.</p>
      <p>This presents an enormous opportunity for productivity, innovation and competitiveness amongst European SMEs and startups, especially in emerging industries such as food, energy and environment. The PARSEC Accelerator was created to seize this opportunity and enable new businesses make faster and better decisions by exploiting the potentials of Earth Observation.</p>
      <p>The PARSEC Accelerator is uniquely positioned to help SMEs and startups benefit from the Earth Observation renaissance, and equip them with the tools they need to make the most of it.</p>
      <p>To join the PARSEC Accelerator, <a href="https://parsec-accelerator.eu/applicants/">apply for Open Call 1</a> – all it takes is a 3-minute video pitch. The 100 selected winners will get €10.000 each, and benefit from business services such as matchmaking, a comprehensive training program and an on-site bootcamp.</p>
      <p>The second stage of the PARSEC Accelerator is where things really get interesting. The participants team up with other companies to form cross-border and cross-sectoral consortia, who finetune their innovative ideas and develop sound business plans. These consortia can then apply to the PARSEC Accelerator Open Call 2 and defend their new business in front of a jury at the PARSEC Demo Day. 15 winning consortia will get €100.000 each to launch their innovations into the market.</p>
