      <p>EVERETT — Gunfire wounded four people, one critically, early Thursday at an apartment on West Casino Road in Everett.</p>
      <p>Police believe the gunman knew the people at the unit in the 100 block of West Casino, not far from Horizon Elementary School. He remained at large hours after he opened fire around 2:45 a.m.</p>
      <p>Responding police officers reportedly saw the suspected shooter as he fled the scene east to another complex. Police described him as a “Hispanic male (with) face tattoos,” who may have escaped in a red SUV. Detectives declined to release the suspect’s identity while they continued to investigate.</p>
      <p>“We’re definitely pretty sure on an identity,” Everett officer Kerby Duncan said around 11 a.m. “We have leads. We have witnesses we’re speaking to.”</p>
      <p>Officers said a large group of people had been in the apartment. Several witnesses were not physically hurt. Police had not confirmed why many people were gathered in the unit.</p>
      <p>All four wounded people were taken to Providence Regional Medical Center Everett. One of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries and remained in critical condition, police said. The others were in stable condition and expected to survive. Everett police declined to provide ages and genders of the people hurt, or to discuss any suspected motive.</p>
      <p>A police dog searched the neighborhood for hours, but didn’t find the suspect. Detectives remained at the scene to investigate into Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Detectives taped off part of the parking lot and closely inspected the ground near the doorway, in search of clues.</p>
      <p>Tips can be directed to the Everett Police Department at 425-257-8450.</p>
