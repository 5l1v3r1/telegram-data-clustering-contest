      <h1>Ukrainian boxing champion Amina Bulakh killed by train while checking her phone</h1>

      <p>An 18-year-old Ukrainian boxing champion was fatally struck by a train as she crossed over a railroad line “wearing headphones and browsing her smartphone,” according to new reports.</p>
      <p>Amina Bulakh — a member of Ukraine’s youth female boxing team and the bronze medalist at a September European championship in Bulgaria — was walking home from a pharmacy in the village of Tarasivka outside Kiev on Nov. 14 when she was killed, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10374590/female-boxing-champion-killed-train-smartphone-headphones/">the Sun reported</a>.</p>
      <p>She strolled over the tracks at a designated crossing — but her headphones made her oblivious to the sound of the oncoming train until it was too late, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The teen tried to get out of the path of the passenger train — which connected Kiev to the nearby city of Fastiv — but it was too late.</p>

      <p>The teen’s coach, Victor Fesechko, <a href="https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/sport/vona-mogla-vse-zigrati-pronyu-prokopivnu-i-stati-chempionkoyu-stali-vidomi-podrobitsi-pro-zhittya-zagibloi-yunoi-bokserki.htm?obozrevatellang=uk&amp;fbclid=IwAR3yXmfSOdPaK5nawEJ8VPnQ5o1RiveexBOfT3BMzdsPxdQ5-ZeXyHbcZT0">told Ukrainian outlet Obozrevatel</a> that he didn’t understand when Bulakh’s mother first tried to tell him what happened.</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘Anya, everything will be fine,’” he told the outlet. “And then like a blow to the head: ‘Amin is gone.'”</p>
      <p>Fesechko recalled meeting Bulakh eight years ago — and turning her down twice before he agreed the third time to train her.</p>
      <p>“A little, slim girl of 10 years came in and she says she wants to be a boxer,” he told the outlet. “I didn’t train girls at the time. It was even strange for me.”</p>
      <p>After Fesecko took Bulakh on, a colleague organizing a tournament told him he was looking for girls to enter. He recruited Bulakh — and she started winning medals, he said.</p>
      <p>Bulakh — who had recently spent time studying in Poland and wanted to pursue a business career — was back home to relax for a few weeks after a period of intense training.</p>
      <p>“Tragic circumstances have taken the life of Ukraine youth female team member Amina Bulakh,” the Boxing Federation of Ukraine <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UkrainianBoxingFederation/photos/a.247163632117054/1336373793196027/?type=3&amp;theater">said in a statement</a>. “Eternal memory to you, Amin Bulakh…”</p>
