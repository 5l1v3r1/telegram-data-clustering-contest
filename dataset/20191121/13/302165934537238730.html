      <p>FRANKFURT AM MAIN, Nov 21 — European Central Bank policymakers strove in an October meeting to restore “unity” and rally behind fiercely fought-over measures decided in September, an account published today showed.</p>
      <p>“A strong call was made for unity of the governing council” made up of the ECB’s six-strong board and 19 national central bank governors from eurozone nations, the account recorded.</p>
      <p>Former president Mario Draghi said following the October meeting that his opponents had called for unity and said “bygones are bygones” after the previous month’s battles.</p>
      <p>Governors agreed in September to further lower the interest rate on banks’ deposits in Frankfurt, loosen conditions on cheap loans to lenders and restart “quantitative easing” (QE) bond-buying from this month.</p>
      <p>While backers of the moves justified them with a slowing eurozone economy plagued by trade fears, opponents said inflation had not yet fallen far enough below the ECB’s just-below-two-per cent target to make them necessary.</p>
      <p>The acrimonious debate boiled over in newspaper interviews and led to the resignation of one German board member.</p>
      <p>But by October, some members found new data “had confirmed the pronounced slowdown in euro area economic growth and a continued shortfall of inflation... thus vindicating the monetary policy decisions,” the account showed.</p>
      <p>In what reads like a rearguard action from tough-love “hawks”, parts of the governing council insisted that “the measures should be allowed more time to fully unfold their effects” before the ECB moves in response to new developments.</p>
      <p>“A plea was made for patience,” the account showed.</p>
      <p>Since Draghi’s departure at the end of October, new central bank chief Christine Lagarde has looked to renew bonds of trust among governing council members.</p>
      <p>In a photo tweeted from her account on November 14, the 25 relaxed and smiling central bankers were seated around a circular table in a plush hotel outside Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Following the “retreat” away from the ECB’s glass-and-steel tower, former French finance minister Lagarde is scheduled to speak at a Frankfurt banking conference tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Markets are on tenterhooks for any hints about future policy.</p>
      <p>The account showed that the central bankers still see some warning signs on their dashboard, including weakness in industry that risks spreading to the service sector.</p>
      <p>“An increase in underlying inflation might not readily materialise given the current weaker macroeconomic outlook,” some noted.</p>
      <p>That could translate into new action sooner rather than later, if the governing council sticks to Draghi’s injunction last month to “never give up” on the inflation goal. — AFP</p>
