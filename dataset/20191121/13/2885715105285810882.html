      <p>A huge statue of baby Jesus in Mexico has taken social media by storm. The nearly 22-foot-tall, 2,000-pound giant sculpture that was built for the La EpifanÍa del Señor church in Zacatecas has got everyone talking online. The debate is about who it resembles more: actor Nicholas Cage or pop star Phil Collins?</p>
      <p>According to Mexican channel <i>Info 7 News</i>, artist Román Salvador Barrueto and his team created the statue after being commissioned by the church. However, with its big blue eyes, full cheeks and a receding hairline, the statue reminded some of the Hollywood star and others of the former Genesis frontman.</p>

      <p>Although the statue that stands over six-metres-high wasn’t commissioned to bag any records, it’s enormous size makes it eligible for one in the Guinness World Records. Priest Humberto Rodriguez told Central European News that he only meant to commission a statue that would “fit the church,” but may have created the biggest baby Jesus in the world.</p>

      <p>“There is a space of between 26 feet between the ceiling and the floor and I ordered a statue measuring 21 feet, but I never intended to make it the biggest baby Jesus statue in the world,” he said.</p>
      <p>The church has found that the previous world record-holding statue was just 16-feet-tall and weighed 661 pounds. According to an NY Post report, the priest has contacted the Guinness World Records.</p>
