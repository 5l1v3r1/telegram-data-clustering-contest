      <p>PHOENIX — Large hail coated the desert in parts of the Phoenix metro area as a string of storms that unleashed three days of wet weather blew out of Arizona.</p>
      <p>National Weather Service meteorologists say hail fell Thursday afternoon in parts of Phoenix and the suburbs of Goodyear, Avondale, Tempe, Mesa and Apache Junction — an unusual sight in the desert.</p>
      <p>Some people said hail as small as a marble covered their property, while others say they saw hail as big as a silver dollar.</p>
      <p>TV news helicopters shot video of children sledding on a hill covered by snow-like hail west of Phoenix and golfers in Scottsdale playing on courses blanketed by hail.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists say many Phoenix-area cities got at least 1 inch (2.5 centimetres) of rain since Tuesday.</p>
