          <b>Philly Fed's Manufacturing Index came in stronger than expected in November.</b>

          <b>US Dollar Index largely ignored the data and stays in range below 98. </b>

      <p>The economic activity in the Third Federal Reserve District's manufacturing sector expanded at a stronger pace than expected in November with the Philadelphia Fed's Manufacturing Index improving to 10.4 from 5.6 in October and beating the market forecast of 7.</p>
      <p>"The indexes for current shipments and new orders both fell: The current new orders index decreased 18 points, while the shipments index decreased 9 points," the publication read. "Both the unfilled orders and delivery times indexes remained positive this month, suggesting higher unfilled orders and slower delivery times."</p>
      <p>The US Dollar Index failed to capitalize on the upbeat data and was last seen moving sideways near the 97.80 handle.</p>
