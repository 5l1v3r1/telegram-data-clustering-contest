      <p>Ryanair's controversial baggage policy has been branded unfair by a court after a woman was issued a fine for failing to purchase carry-on luggage ahead of her flight.</p>
      <p>A Spanish court described the budget airline's policy of charging a fee for hand luggage as "excessive" for passengers.</p>
      <p>It came after a woman was told to pay a €20 (£17) penalty fine to bring her 10kg luggage on board after failing to buy a priority rate ticket in advance.</p>
      <p>The passenger was travelling from Madrid to Brussels when she was charged to bring her extra luggage.</p>
      <p>Ryanair's passenger guidelines allow only small bags as hand luggage if they can be stowed beneath the seat in front.</p>
      <p>However the judge said the baggage could easily have fitted in the cabin.</p>

      <p>In its ruling, the Commercial Court ruled that the woman should be refunded with interest.</p>
      <p>It's now ruled the policy to be null and void and told Ryanair "to remove it" from its terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>However the Irish carrier said it would not change its bagging policy.</p>
      <p>"This ruling will not affect Ryanair's baggage policy, either in the past or in the future, as it is an isolated case that misinterpreted our commercial freedom to determine the size of our cabin baggage," it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Ryanair has a policy of charging customers an additional fee for carrying anything more than one personal item on board. Larger bags can also require a luggage fee.</p>
      <p>The airline changed its baggage policy last year, requiring all travellers to pay for hand luggage, which until November 1 was free.</p>
      <p>The ruling cannot be appealed.</p>
