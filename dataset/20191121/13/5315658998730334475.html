      </p>
      <p>Simply telling businesses to be confident isn’t going to turn around their declining optimism, National’s Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
      <p>“The Prime Minister has today warned businesses about talking themselves ‘into a funk’, especially when the economy is, according to her, in ‘good heart’.</p>
      <p>“Simply telling businesses to be confident doesn’t cut it. All the Prime Minister is trying to do is brush these very real concerns businesses are feeling under the rug.</p>
      <p>“This Government is driving down business confidence by adding costs, creating uncertainty, making a hash of key projects like KiwiBuild, as well as overseeing a looming infrastructure crisis.</p>
      <p>“Instead of falling back on excuses like ‘global headwinds’, the Government needs to start delivering for businesses.</p>
      <p>“The effects of low business confidence is flowing into our weakening labour market, with job growth stalling under this Government’s mismanagement of the economy.</p>
      <p>“If National is elected in 2020 we’ll stop the excuses and get on with implementing our positive economic plan to restore business confidence and revive the economy.”</p>
