      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission, on Thursday, presented Certificates of Return to the winner of last Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi State, Governor Yahaya Bello and his running mate, Edward David Onoja.</p>
      <p>The event took place at the Professor Mahmoud Yakubu Hall, at the state headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Lokoja, the state capital.</p>
      <p>Bello and Onoja had contested last Saturday’s governorship election on the platform of All Progressives Congress and returned winners.</p>
      <p>APC had polled a total of 406,222 votes to defeat Peoples Democratic Party’s Musa Wada, who polled 189,704 votes.</p>
      <p>The National Commissioner in charge of North Central, Mohammed Kudu Haruna, who presented the certificates to the governor-elect and deputy governor-elect said, “Today marks a new beginning after the election and a call to duty for the governor-elect and his deputy.”</p>
      <p>Earlier the Kogi state resident Electoral Commissioner, Professor James Apam said the presentation was in line with the tradition of the commission.</p>
      <p>“We know what we went through to get to this stage and its time to settle down for the job ahead” he noted.</p>
      <p>In his acceptance speech, Governor Bello said while the day was the second time he would be receiving a Certificate of Return as a governor, it will not be the last time he will be receiving a Certificate of Return from INEC.</p>
