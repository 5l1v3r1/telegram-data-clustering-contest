      <p>An Ebute Meta Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos State on Thursday ordered the remand of a 17-year-old who allegedly stabbed another teenager to death.</p>
      <p>The Chief Magistrate, A.O. Komolafe, ordered that the defendant should be kept at the Special Correctional Centre for Boys in Oregun, Lagos.</p>
      <p>The defendant, a resident of Agunfoye, Igbogbo, Ikorodu, Lagos State, was brought on a two-count charge of conspiracy and murder.</p>
