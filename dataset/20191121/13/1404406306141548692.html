      <p>Omarion opened up to VladTV about who he would include on his Mount Rushmore of singers, and he pointed out that four spots is not enough to list all of the brilliant singers he has in mind. However, he went on to name four, initially listing James Brown, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder. But Brown was replaced with Prince after DJ Vlad asked Omarion about the "Purple Rain" singer. Omarion also shared his female Mount Rushmore list, which you can hear in full above.</p>
