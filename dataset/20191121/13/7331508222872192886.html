        <b><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2005/air-force-falcons">Air Force Falcons</a> (-22, 55.5) at <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/167/new-mexico-lobos">New Mexico Lobos</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Stanford Steve:</b> The Lobos have been decimated by injuries this season. They most recently lost running backs <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4261168/bryson-carroll">Bryson Carroll</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4363923/ahmari-davis">Ahmari Davis</a> and are down to 57 scholarship players after enduring 14 season-ending injuries. They don't have enough scout-team running backs to help prep for the vaunted Air Force rush attack. New Mexico started the season 2-1 and has since lost seven in a row. It seems like the Lobos don't have enough to keep it close.</p>
