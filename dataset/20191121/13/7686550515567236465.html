      <h1>What is the 'Snyder Cut' and why are people calling for it?</h1>
      <h2>Justice League is a weird mishmash that certainly didn't live up to the hype</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:32:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:32</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Harker</a></address>
      <p>As far as superhero films go there are good ones, bad ones and then there's Justice League.</p>
      <p>It's certainly not the worst offering from the DC cinematic universe, that accolade is reserved for either Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad, but Justice League is a weird mishmash that certainly didn't live up to the hopes of most who saw it.</p>
      <p>The strange nature of the film owes something to a troubled production. Director Zack Snyder stepped down with the film almost complete due to the death of his daughter and Avengers director Joss Whedon was brought in to finish it off.</p>
      <p>The final product made a lot of money but struggled to gain critical reception and cast the future of the DCEU into doubt, but more than two years since being released a core of fans believe there's a lost masterpiece waiting in the wings.</p>
      <h3>The Claim</h3>
      <p>Almost immediately after the film made it to cinemas the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut campaign started, promoting the idea that Snyder had completed a version of Justice League which they believed to be superior to the final product.</p>
      <p>The fan campaign now has the backing of most of the film's stars with Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa and Ray Fisher <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-50456802">among those calling for Warner Bros to release the Snyder Cut.</a></p>
      <p>Snyder himself has supported the actors calling for his cut of the movie, appearing on multiple occasions to confirm that such a version exists and there are people at Warner Bros able to release it to the public if they want.</p>
      <p>While many didn't like Man of Steel or Batman v Superman, Snyder's previous two DCEU offerings, a vocal minority of viewers were very satisfied with what they got. They are the biggest supporters of the Snyder Cut.</p>
      <p>When a film like Justice League comes out it's comforting to think that there's a better version of it. At the very least a movie done by one director instead of two might be a more cohesive end product than the one which ended up in cinemas two years ago.</p>
      <h3>The Counter Claim</h3>
      <p>When a film like Justice League comes out to such disappointment it's comforting to think that there's a better version of it stored in some vault.</p>
      <p>The film we got was pretty bad but as long as the fabled Snyder Cut remains unseen it can be whatever fans want it to be, imagined as a lost masterpiece that rights the various wrongs of Justice League instead of a critical flop like Snyder's previous DC films.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/snyder-cut-ben-affleck-gal-gadot-call-new-justice-league-release-1255582">Warner Bros haven't given any indication they're about to release the Snyder Cut,</a> nor have they confirmed that an alternative version of Justice League actually exists.</p>
      <p>Paul Tassi of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/17/release-the-snyder-cut-justice-league-movement-may-bear-fruit-with-support-from-snyder-affleck-gadot/">Forbes</a> reckons it might be a marketing stunt drumming up recognition for the Snyder Cut ahead of an actual release.</p>
      <p>However, he suggests it could just as easily be the director and actors getting so sick of hearing from the campaign that they made the statements so fans would stop asking them about it. If it looks like they're onboard with the campaign then it'll turn attention towards Warner Bros.</p>
      <h3>The Facts</h3>
      <p>A film taking $657.9 million worldwide isn't usually going to class as a disappointment, but Justice League was the fifth most expensive film ever with production costs of $300 million and it was outperformed by all three Marvel movies released in 2017.</p>
      <p>Thor: Ragnarok took $854 million, Spider-Man: Homecoming made $880.2 million and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 made $863.8 million worldwide.</p>
      <p>The year afterwards Avengers: Infinity War took $2.048 billion worldwide. As a movie that brings together a number of famous superheroes for a collaborative effort, it's the sort of film Justice League ought to be competing with but fell utterly short of.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/film/2019-11-18/does-the-snyder-cut-exist-or-not/">Radio Times</a> reports that when Snyder left the director's seat on Justice League there was a 151 minute version which existed, a longer film than the two hour version audiences got.</p>
      <p>However, they also report Snyder's version of the film still had plenty of work to do on special effects and sound editing, meaning it would take months of work and cost millions of dollars to get into a state where it would resemble a film ready for cinematic release.</p>
