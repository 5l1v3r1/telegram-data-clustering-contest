      <p>A lawyer was shot dead after a shotgun being exhibited as evidence during a trial went off in a freak accident.</p>
      <p>South African senior advocate Addelaid Ferreira-Watt died at Ixopo Regional Court on Monday after the gun was dropped on the floor, causing it to fire and rip a hole in her left hip, The Sunday Times of South Africa reports.</p>
      <p>Court staff attempted to stem the bleeding as they called an ambulance, but despite their efforts and those of the paramedics, the mother-of-one was later pronounced dead in hospital.</p>
      <p>Umzimkhulu police are investigating the fatal incident as culpable homicide, News24 reports.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said: “It is alleged on Monday at 3.20pm a 51-year-old woman was taken to hospital after she was struck by a shot to the left hip.</p>
      <p>“She later died in hospital. It is alleged that the weapon was brought to court to be entered as evidence in a house robbery case when it accidentally discharged in court.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, we cannot divulge further information as the investigations are at a sensitive stage.”</p>
      <p>KwaZulu-Natal director of public prosecutions Elaine Zungu confirmed the lawyer died on Monday.</p>

      <p>She said: “Her untimely passing is mourned by all. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time. The family has requested that their privacy be respected.”</p>
      <p>An unnamed legal friend of the barrister to the Mirror Online: “There is absolutely no need for a weapon being submitted in evidence in a court of law to still be capable of being fired.”</p>
      <p>The firearm had reportedly been stolen in a robbery and later recovered and returned to Cheryl Biggs and her husband Dave.</p>
      <p>They told South African newspaper The Witness that police had not kept the firearm as an exhibit pending the trial because they needed the weapon for protection.</p>
      <p>Instead, it was collected by police on Monday and Ms. Biggs told the paper she had told the police she did not know if it was loaded or not.</p>
