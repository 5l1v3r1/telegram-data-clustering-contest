      <p>Running a successful consumer tech website is about much more than keeping up to date with the latest technology products and services. Our most important metric for success is whether or not you enjoy the service we provide and keep coming back for more. Help us learn how we can serve you better.</p>
      <p>Our 2019 Reader Survey, sponsored by <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=350&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=2154&amp;aff_sub=06-3778303-11-0000000">NordVPN</a> (our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/internet/best-vpn-reviews-3657732/">top-rated VPN service</a>), explores how you feel about Tech Advisor, what we’re doing well and where we can improve.</p>
      <p>We also want to know which products you want to hear more about and how you want to hear it.</p>
      <p>As a token of our gratitude, all those who complete the survey will be entered into a prize draw for the chance to win a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-note-10-3700650/">Samsung Galaxy Note 10</a> or one of 40 £20 Amazon vouchers.</p>
