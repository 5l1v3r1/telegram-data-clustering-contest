        <b>A HEALTH board has admitted their communication with families has not been good enough after being accused of covering up the death of a 10-year-old girl at Glasgow's superhospital.</b>
      </p>
      <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has apologised to the family of cancer patient Milly Main who died after contracting a bug while at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.</p>

      <p>The apology comes after Health Secretary Jeane Freeman slammed the health board and admitted Milly's death may have been as a result of contaminated water.</p>
      <p>As well as saying sorry, they also say they are working on how to improve communication in the future.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for NHSGCC said: "We completely understand that this has been a distressing time for families and our staff and we apologise for the anxiety caused.</p>
      <p>“Our communication with families and parents has not been good enough and we deeply regret this.</p>
      <p>“We continue to take steps to improve communications and to answer questions openly and truthfully.</p>
      <p>"We are also working with Professor Craig White to develop better ways of engaging with families.</p>

      <p>“There are clearly lessons for this Board to learn and we are committed to making the necessary improvements.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to leave 'no stone unturned' in helping the family get answers.</p>
      <p>Speaking at First Minister's Questions, she also said there was a "strong case" for the health board to be put into "special measures".</p>
      <p>Freeman's blast came after she was forced to make an apology at Holyrood, where she also brought up concerns raised by other patients.</p>
      <p>She branded the health board's handling of the situation 'appalling' and blasted them for criticising the whistleblower who exposed the scandal.</p>
      <p>The source claimed Milly died after contracting an infection from dirty water at the hospital - one of 25 who had picked up the bug.</p>

      <p>A probe was launched but never made public by NHSGCC.</p>
      <p>Milly's mum Kimberly Darroch said she <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10357665/heartbroken-mum-who-claims-daughter-was-killed-by-dirty-water-at-hospital-begs-health-chiefs-to-tell-the-truth/">felt "let down and lied to"</a> and "100 per cent convinced" that he daughter was killed by contaminated water.</p>
      <p>Freeman told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/health-secretary-admits-dirty-water-20923955">Daily Record</a>: "There is no excuse for Milly’s parents not to have been given the full information at the time when their child died.</p>
      <p>“I don’t believe people are wilfully intending to cause more pain and upset to others, but their actions, or their failure to act, clearly in this instance, absolutely do.”</p>
      <p>The health board previously admitted Milly contracted a bug, but said there was no proof it came from the hospital.</p>
      <p>But Freeman added: "That’s not really helpful to Milly’s mum, and it is reasonable that, knowing what she knows now, that she would suspect that it came from the water in the hospital.”</p>
      <p>Asked whether she suspected Milly’s infection had come from the QEUH, Freeman said: “I don’t know, but given what we know about levels of water borne infections in and around the period that I know of, which is 2018….then I think it is a reasonable position to take that it could have come from the hospital.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She also urged them to make the findings of the investigation public, adding: “First of all, why did we not know? Secondly, what does it say? Give us it.</p>
      <p>"Let’s see that information in full. And thirdly, what did you do when you got that information?”</p>
      <p>On the criticism of the whistleblower, she said: "I thought that was appalling. That’s why in the statement I made today in Parliament I said whistleblowers should not be publicly or privately criticised.</p>
      <p>"I think the board have moved away from that position in recent days, but nonetheless that doesn’t mean that what they initially said in their comments is the least bit acceptable, because it is not.”</p>
