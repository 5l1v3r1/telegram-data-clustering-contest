      <h1>Gen Z’s ‘OK, Boomer’ meme may become a TV show</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:57:40+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author">Lauren Sarner</a></address>
      <p>“OK, Boomer” has become the hottest clapback of the moment — and now it’s set to become a show.</p>
      <p>Fox Media has made a trademark <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88687936&amp;docId=RFA20191114082601#docIndex=0&amp;page=1">application</a> for the term, with the intent of turning it into “reality competitions, comedy, and game shows,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/20/ok-boomer-the-insult-of-the-year-is-about-to-become-a-tv-show?utm_term=RWRpdG9yaWFsX01lZGlhQnJpZWZpbmctMTkxMTIx&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=media_email&amp;utm_campaign=MediaBriefing">according to the Guardian</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/gen-z-is-making-bank-off-their-baby-boomer-anger-with-ok-boomer/">The phrase</a>, which is both a meme and an insult, is a way for younger people to put down older people who are clueless about reality. An older person doesn’t understand that wages, student debt and the economy make the job market wildly different than when they were first starting out?</p>
      <p>OK, Boomer.</p>
      <p>They make a sneering comment about millennials wasting money on avocado toast or about Gen-Z college students having too many feelings?</p>
      <p>OK, Boomer.</p>
      <p>It’s essentially an eye-roll response to somebody who is clueless about new ideas or current realities. It burst onto the scene in 2019, primarily on Instagram and TikTok, which makes this a fast turnaround for a TV show.</p>
      <p>Naturally, older people <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/millennials-extreme-hatred-for-baby-boomers-is-totally-unjustified/">aren’t exactly pleased</a> about it.</p>
      <p>Ironically, while it could make for a timely episode of a currently airing show that could address it quickly, memes and internet trends rise and fall fast.</p>
      <p>By the time one of these ideas comes to fruition next year or in 2021 — especially a game show — guess what the world’s reaction will probably be?</p>
      <p>“OK, Boomer.”</p>
