      <p>Nammazhvar says that the Lord is accessible and easy to comprehend as far as His devotees are concerned. He can easily be won with our love, as seen in the case of His attitude towards Yasoda. When Yasoda wanted to punish Krishna, He yielded to her wish and allowed her to tie Him up. If one thinks of His immeasurable greatness, of His infinite auspicious qualities, one cannot help wondering at His simplicity. Yasoda was not a practitioner of any of the three types of yoga, which Krishna later recommended to Arjuna. But her love for Krishna was huge, and it was this love that bound Him, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse.</p>
      <p>How great a matter this is can be seen if we pick up an example from life. Think of a temple elephant that is led to a river every day by its mahout. He scrubs its body and splashes water all over it, and the elephant enjoys the bath. But on its return to the temple, it picks up dust and sprinkles it over its body. Of course, the mahout, even if unhappy, cannot ask the elephant why it does so. Let us assume the elephant can answer. Then what will the elephant say? It will say that it likes putting sand all over its body, and it will do what it likes. If the mahout were to ask, “If so, then why did you bathe?” The elephant will then reply, “I allowed you to bathe me, because I also like baths.”</p>
      <p>So, in both cases, the elephant does only what it wants to do, and is not bound by what someone else wants. If an animal can have so much independence, then think of how much more independence the Supreme One will have. The Lord is described as an elephant by Thirumangai Azhvar. But whereas, a four-legged elephant does what it wants, the Supreme One as Krishna submitted Himself to Yasoda, so that she could tie Him up.</p>
