      <p>Sixteen people have been discovered in a sealed trailer on board a ferry from France to the Republic of Ireland, Stena Line has confirmed.</p>
      <p>All are reportedly in good health on board the ferry which is set to arrive at Rosslare later.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Ian Hampton, Stena Line’s chief people and communications officer, said an employee discovered the people during a routine inspection.</p>
      <p>“During the Stena Horizon’s 9pm sailing from Cherbourg, France, to Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday November 20, one of our employees during a routine inspection discovered 16 people in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck,” he said.</p>
      <p>“All the individuals are reported to be in good health and have been moved to a private passenger lounge on the ship where their wellbeing is the focus of our employees.</p>
      <p>“Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel’s arrival in Rosslare.</p>
      <p>“The vessel is scheduled to arrive at approximately 3.30pm today.”</p>
      <p>The incident comes just days after a group of 25 people were found inside a refrigerated container on board a UK bound ship just off the coast of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Last month 39 people were found dead inside a container in Essex which had arrived in the UK via ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
