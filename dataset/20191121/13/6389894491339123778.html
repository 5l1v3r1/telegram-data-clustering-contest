      <p>Germany’s banking outlook has been slashed by credit ratings agency Moody’s amid concerns over the current low interest rate environment.</p>
      <p>Moody’s has cut its forecast from stable to negative for the country’s lenders, adding that their profitability and overall creditworthiness will likely decline over the next 12 to 18 months.</p>

      <p>Slowing global trade has also dented outlooks for Germany’s key industries, such as the automotive and manufacturing sectors.</p>
      <p>According to the agency, Germany’s smaller, purely deposit-funded banks will be hardest hit.</p>
      <p>German banks have had very limited success in improving their high cost-to-income ratios which reached 80 per cent in 2018, Moody’s said.</p>
      <p>"Banks' weak profitability will decline further as net interest income falls," said Bernhard Held, VP-senior credit officer at Moody's.</p>
      <p>He added: "Traditional commercial banks and in particular deposit-funded institutions will struggle to out-earn their costs in the continuing low interest rate environment, even though loan-loss provisions are unsustainably low."</p>

      <p>So-called low-for-long interest rates have driven concerns over the profitability of Europe’s banking giants in recent months.</p>
      <p>Alongside new regulations and troubles in the global economy, low and negative rates have put pressure on banks’ net interest income.</p>
