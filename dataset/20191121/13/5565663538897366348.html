      <p>The Presidential guard who was arrested for firing bullets at State House on Wednesday was tortured and sent to a medical doctor on Thursday morning, Professor Jonathan Moyo has revealed. <br/><br/>Moyo who broke the news said the soldier was interviewed by Commander of One Presidential Guard Infantry Battalion at State House, Lieutenant-Colonel Samson Murombo.<br/><br/>State House is President Emmerson Mnangagwa's official residence.<br/><br/>Said Moyo, "On arrest Private Magandu was interviewed by Lt Col S. Murombo, detained at KGVI; tortured and deprived of sleep for alleged links with opposition and foreigners; ranted that men in suits get all the money but real army gets nothing. He was sent for psychiatric evaluation this morning!"<br/><br/>On Wednesday Moyo broke the news that Magandu emptied his magazine firing in the air at State House on Wednesday morning and was arrested as he was reloading. He is said to haveÂ  complained of hardships and said he can't survive in dead economy.<br/><br/>A social media message that has gone viral purportedly written by people in the army has warned the leadership of the army from ill treating Magandu. <br/><br/>We published the unedited below message:<br/><br/><i>Let me warn the Command Element that any unfair treatment on Pvt Maganhu will not be tolerated by many of us. He is not alone. We are wallowing in poverty. We can't feed our children neither can we support our parents anymore. Our wives are now resorting to prostitution without our knowledge in order to sustain our families. E D Mnangagwa is busy bribing our commanders and expecting us to protect him. He took that CDF to U A E and bribed him with millions of dollars in cash. Few are benefiting at the top and getting US dollars whilst we are given r t g s dollars which you can't even take from the bank. Handle the issue of Maganhu with care. He speaks for many and we have the guns. If Mnangagwa wants protection he must be guarded by Valerio and his cohorts that he is rewarding with US dollars.</i></p>
