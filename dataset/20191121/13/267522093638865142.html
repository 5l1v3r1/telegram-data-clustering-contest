      <p>There are few things we love here at T3 more than finding amazing deals and <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-uk-deals-update-nov-20">Black Friday 2019</a> is shaping up to be an amazing one for tech. We've been working night and day scouring the interwebs to bring you the best of the best, helping you spare as many expenses as possible. </p>
      <p>Honestly, if there's a deal around, more likely than not we've seen it, meaning the ones we write about are the cream of the crop. This year is an especially big one, too,  with literally hundreds of deals kicking around for us to go through – not that we're complaining. </p>

      <p>If you've clicked through to this deal you likely have some idea of how damn good Samsung Smart TVs look, maybe you've seen one in your local Walmart or Best Buy. Well, you aren't wrong: this TV, in all its 4K glory, is a thing to behold and at 55" you'll have more than enough space for anything you want to throw up on there.</p>
      <p>There's a lot to love here: 4 HMDI ports, for any device you could imagine; a gaming feature that smooths fast-paced graphics; an ultra-slim design; QLED for extra definition; and a Quantum 4K processor so that ultra-high-res content pops. For the price, you'd have to look far and wide to find anything even close.</p>
