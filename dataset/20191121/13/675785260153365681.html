      <h1>8 'radical' Labour manifesto policies that are totally normal in other countries</h1>
      <h2>Everyone's talking about how the Labour Party's general election manifesto is the most radical in years - but a lot of the policies in it are the norm elsewhere in the world</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:37:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Labour's general election manifesto has been described as the most radical political pitch in years.</p>
      <p>Running to 107 pages, it includes pledges to renationalise the railways, take water services into public ownership and scrap tuition fees.</p>
      <p>The party promise to extend free childcare to one and two year olds.</p>
      <p>And it promises to return corporation tax to 26%.</p>
      <p>This may be seen as radical in Britain, but some of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> 's policies already look familiar if you live abroad.</p>
      <p>Here's eight 'radical' proposals in the Labour manifesto that look pretty ordinary overseas.</p>
      <h3>1. Nationalising the railways</h3>

      <p>Labour would repeal the Tories' 1993 Railways Act and bring the railways back under state ownership.</p>
      <p>This would happen over a decade or so one network at a time, when each private franchise expires.</p>
      <p>In <b>Germany</b> state-owned national operator Deutsche Bahn ran 94% of services on time and earned back nearly €2bn in 2015.</p>
      <p>In <b>France,</b> government-owned SNCF Group recorded a net profit of €567m in 2016.</p>
      <p>And in <b>Canada,</b> Via Rail is a 'Crown Corporation' which runs the rails on behalf of the government. It received $267m of state funding to plug losses in 2016, but passenger revenues grew almost 9.5%.</p>
      <p>Admittedly EU law is a stumbling block to <u><b>new</b> </u>nationalisation, because it pushes "greater competition" on rail networks.</p>
      <p>But that would cease to be a stumbling block if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> happened.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>2. Nationalising water</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20884343.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS158255820.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> promise to bring the water network into public ownership.</p>
      <p>That's just normal in most of the world - it's normal in many parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Publicly owned <b>Scottish Water</b> provides plumbing north of the border.</p>
      <p>And while it's not totally nationalised, much of <b>Wales'</b> water is provided by Welsh Water - a not-for-profit company, which serves 3 million people.</p>
      <p>In fact, England is one of the only countries in the world to have fully privatised its water and sewerage system.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>3. Restrictions on gambling advertising in sports</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The Labour manifesto promises to "curb gambling advertising in sports."</p>
      <p>It doesn't go into more detail than that - but even in countries where sports betting is legal it's far from unusual for restrictions to be placed on advertising.</p>
      <p>Many states in the <b>US</b> outlaw gambling on sports events altogether. <b>Australia</b> has banned gambling ads during sporting events - including on streaming services.</p>
      <p>And <b>Italy</b> last year announced plans to ban gambling firms from sponsoring sports teams and stadiums, a move that has already been taken by <b>Argentina</b> and <b>India.</b></p>
      <h3>4. Free university tuition</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20929080.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_TRMRMMGLPICT000020713283.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: Jason Skarratt)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"We will abolish university tuition fees," the manifesto boasts. "No one should be put off educating themselves for lack of money or fear of debt."</p>
      <p>Fees were introduced under <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> and hiked to £3,000 a year in 2006 and £9,000 a year in 2012.</p>
      <p>The Tories say it's right that people pay their way because fees subsidise the middle class, and the number of people going to university has soared.</p>
      <p>But in <b>Germany</b> tuition's free, despite a flirtation with fees in the last decade and a recent move to charge foreigners.</p>
      <p>There's been much controversy in Germany and talk of this being unsustainable, but Germany actually <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/e/ed/Public_expenditure_on_tertiary_education_as_a_share_of_GDP%2C_2012_%28%C2%B9%29_%28%25%29_ET15.png">spent a smaller percentage of its GDP on higher education</a> than the UK in 2012.</p>
      <p>And it's not alone - neither <b>Finland</b> nor <b>Norway</b> nor <b>Slovenia</b> charge tuition fees for their own citizens.</p>
      <h3>5. Higher corporation tax</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20929098.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_British-dividend-growth.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Britain's corporation tax rate is 19% and set to fall lower after the Tories cut it from 26%.</p>
      <p>Labour is pledging to reverse this - which <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> falsely claimed would see Britain have the "highest rate in Europe".</p>
      <p>But even 26% would be the lowest rate among G7 countries, <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=Table_II1#">according to the OECD.</a></p>
      <p>Taking into account local government taxes, <b>Italy</b> 's rate starts at 27% and can go as high as 34.5%, <b>Germany's</b> works out between 30 and 33%, <b>Japan</b> 30.86 % - its lowest rate in decades, and <b>France</b> between 31 and 33%.</p>
      <p>Labour's Jonathan Ashworth told the BBC: "We've had huge cuts in corporation tax under the Conservatives and normal people are not feeling the benefit of that.</p>
      <p>"So we are going to ask corporations to pay a higher rate of corporation tax - something well in line with what other nations across the European Union are asking them to pay.</p>
      <p>"This is not radical by the standards of our competitors and neighbours."</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson had promised to cut the rate to 17% - but abandoned this pledge this week, despite having claimed just months ago that "every time corporation tax has been cut in this country it has produced more revenue."</p>
      <p>The IFS rubbished this claim.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>6. A rent cap</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20929291.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_First-time-buyers.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The manifesto promises to "stop runaway rents by capping them with inflation".</p>
      <p>This does happen in other countries - but the best-known examples are at a local level.</p>
      <p>Dublin and Cork in <b>Ireland</b> capped rises at 4% last year, with the Housing Minister saying: "We're putting a bridle on the horse that has almost been out of control."</p>
      <p>Most parts of San Francisco in the <b>United States</b> have a rent rise cap of 2.2% this year.</p>
      <p><b>German</b> capital Berlin banned landlords from raising rents by more than 10% above the local average in 2015.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>7. Free childcare for one-year-olds</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9172878.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1960s-WET-BABY-IN-BATH.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The manifesto vows to extend 30 hours of free childcare a week to two-year-olds and "move towards" it for some one-year-olds.</p>
      <p>Tory policy currently offers it to three- and four-year-olds.</p>
      <p>This would be a massive policy for parents, but it's not unheard of.</p>
      <p><b>Finland</b> gives a universal right to childcare for all children between about nine months old and school age. This can include state-provided services.</p>
      <p>The Tory government has outraged green campaigners by refusing to ban fracking. Labour says it'd end it.</p>
      <h3>8. A ban on fracking</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20929072.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Fracking-ban.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Opponents fear fracking - in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture rock and release gas - can cause problems including water contamination, earthquakes and noise and traffic pollution.</p>
      <p>And it's already been banned in <b>France, Bulgaria</b> and <b>Germany.</b></p>
      <p>That's not to mention, erm, <b>Scotland,</b> where the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> -run government announced an indefinite ban on fracking in 2015.</p>
