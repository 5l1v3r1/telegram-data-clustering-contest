      <h1>Ryan Lowe enthuses over Plymouth Argyle's 'unbelieveable' £8 million Mayflower Grandstand</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims' game against Bradford on Saturday is the last one before the grandstand reopens</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:33:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle’s League Two game against Bradford City at Home Park on Saturday will be the last one before the £8 million-plus Mayflower Grandstand reopens to fans.</p>
      <p>This weekend will see another milestone reached in the redevelopment project, though.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">Pilgrims’ boss Ryan Lowe</a>, his staff and substitutes – as well as their Bradford counterparts – will be using the new dug-outs for the first time.</p>
      <p>They are both set back into the lower level of the grandstand, which can now be seen clearly after the removal of the safety hoardings in front of it.</p>
      <p>Lowe joked: “It’s a good job (Bradford boss) Gary Bowyer is a good bloke because he’s right next to us!”</p>
      <p>The grandstand will open to 50 per cent of its 5,40-3seat capacity for Argyle’s next league game.</p>
      <p>That will see former Pilgrims’ boss Derek Adams bring his new Morecambe team to Home Park on December 14.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “It’s the last game before we get some fans in there, which will be nice.</p>
      <p>“It has been a long process and it’s finally here now. Everyone involved really needs a pat on the back because it’s going to look phenomenal once it’s full.”</p>
      <p>Lowe has had a look around the inside the grandstand, including at his office, and was very impressed.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims’ boss is aware that some supporters have questioned why the corners at either end of the grandstand have not been filled in.</p>
      <p>However, Lowe pointed out the huge financial commitment of Argyle’s owner/chairman Simon Hallett to get the redevelopment done as it has been.</p>

      <p>Lowe said: “It’s all budgets. Simon Hallett has put a lot of money into the football club to make it just like that.</p>
      <p>“I’m aware that they have got planning permission to come around eventually and build up.</p>
      <p>“If the club starts moving through the league swiftly then I’m sure that will happen. The same with the training ground eventually, they will start doing it up.</p>
      <p>“What the club has got to do is stand on its own two feet really with the money.</p>
      <p>“Simon can’t just keep ploughing money in all the time. If the team is successful then you start climbing the league and the money starts coming in.”</p>
      <p>The grandstand will be used for the first time when Argyle Ladies play Watford at Home Park on Sunday, December 8, and it will be open to 38 per cent capacity.</p>
      <p>That is one a series of test events leading up to its full opening for the League Two game against Swindon Town on New Year’s Day.</p>
      <p>The all-seat capacity of Home Park will then become 18,200, with the grandstand the centrepiece.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “For League Two it’s unbelievable. We all know we are not in the right league, because of the stadium, the fanbase, the club and everything else that is with it.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, we are where we are. Hard work has started with the grandstand, with the recruitment of myself and my players to hopefully push on.</p>
      <p>“It certainly helps when you are going to have potentially 18,000 here on New Year’s Day against Swindon Town.”</p>
      <p>Lowe is looking forward to using the new home dug-out for the first time against Bradford.</p>

      <p>He said: “I actually took the dug-outs down at Bury last year because you were in like a little hut and I wanted to be close to the fans.</p>
      <p>“We took them away and we were literally in with the fans. There were some good moments and some bad moments in that.</p>
      <p>“But as long as it’s constructive criticism, if it’s aimed at me or any of my staff, or my players, then that’s fine.</p>
      <p>“We want the fans to be around us. It’s going to be good – I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
