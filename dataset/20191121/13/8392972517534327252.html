      <p>One of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a>'s favourite couples could be about to experience one of the worst ordeals of their lives - and it's all thanks to newcomer Jade Rowan.</p>
      <p>In distressing scenes set to air in the New Year, Fiz Brown and Tyrone Dobbs will have their children taken away from them by social services, new reports suggest.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10388454/corries-fiz-tyrone-social-services/">The Sun</a>, Fiz and Tyrone's live-in tutor Jade will "show her true colours", when she reports the couple to social services and has their kids Hope and Ruby taken into care.</p>
      <p>A TV insider said: "The couple will be completely blindsided by having their children taken off them and at a loss as to how it could have happened.</p>
      <p>"But it is actually Jade that has reported them to social services for allegedly abusing Hope, and Tyrone's daughter, Ruby."</p>

      </p>
      <p>They continued: "They are taken away from the couple while an investigation into the claims is carried out.</p>
      <p>"In the meantime, Fiz and Tyrone face 2020 wondering what happened to their family."</p>
      <aside>The couple will be completely blindsided by having their children taken off them.</aside>
      <p>The twist will turn the family upside down, especially as Jade - played by Lottie Henshall - suddenly disappears.</p>

      <p>Of course, Evelyn Plummer - who has suspected Jade from the beginning - becomes intent on tracking her down and confronting her.</p>
      <p>But, when Evelyn finds her, Tyrone warns her that a showdown could harm their chances of getting the children back from social services.</p>
      <p>Corrie fans have long <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-streets-evelyn-murdered-by-jade-when-she-discovers-her-real-identity/">suspected Jade of cruel intentions</a> and some even believe she is keeping an explosive secret - that she is in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-fans-fear-jade-is-killer-john-stapes-sister/">some way related to killer John Stape</a>.</p>
      <p>The care worker who is currently living with Tyrone, Fiz and Weatherfield battleaxe Evelyn has been acting shiftily ever since she arrived in September - but why?</p>

      <p>Jade moved into Fiz and Tyrone's home to help tutor Hope, and it's been clear all is not what it seems.</p>
      <p>In next week's episodes, Fiz and Tyrone break the news to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/first-look-next-weeks-coronation-street-in-10-pictures-47/">Jade that her services will no longer be required</a>, as they've managed to enrol Hope back into Bessie Street School.</p>
      <p>However, Jade won't take the news well...</p>
      <p>But why does Jade report the family to social services? And why does she seem to have a vendetta against the family?</p>
      <p>Is she a secret Stape as so many viewers predict?</p>
