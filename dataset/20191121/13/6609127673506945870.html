      <p>He was arrested on November 2, and cops say he has now been charged.</p>
      <p>He is expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.</p>
      <p>Suzanne McNulty of the Public Protection Unit in Govan said: “Officers in Glasgow carried out enquiries following reports that three women had been the victim of sexual assaults in the West End between 17 and 31 October.</p>
      <p>“Extensive enquires were ongoing into these incidents which were linked following information which came to light following the third attack.</p>
      <p>“A 34-year-old man was arrested on November 2 and has now been charged in connection with all three of these incidents.</p>
      <p>"He is due to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today, Thursday, 21 November, 2019.</p>
      <p>“In every serious crime reported to police, officers carefully consider whether or not it is appropriate to proactively make the circumstances public.</p>
      <p>“This is continually assessed throughout the investigation to ensure the safety of victims and the wider public is protected.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to liaise with Glasgow University and the surrounding communities as part of our continued investigations into this.”</p>
