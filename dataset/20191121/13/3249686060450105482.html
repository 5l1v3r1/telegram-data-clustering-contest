      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/hyeri">Hyeri</a> talked about being compared to <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/suzy">Suzy</a> and <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/seolhyun">Seolhyun</a> as idol-turned-actors.<br/><br/>At an interview on November 21, the <b>Girl's Day</b> member opened up about how she feels about her acting career being compared to her fellow idol-turned-actors, former <b>miss A</b> member and Suzy and <b>AOA</b>'s Seolhyun. Hyeri expressed, <i>"Rather than a competition or rivalry, I cheer them on because I can feel how hard everyone is working."</i><br/><br/>She continued, <i>"We're acting around the same time, and I think we've always been talked about together. Competition is embarrassing, and I think it becomes an issue. I'm happy that my name is even among them. I think I'd be disappointed if my name wasn't brought up. I'd think to myself, 'I'm starring in a drama too right now.' That's why I try to think of it in a positive light."<br/><br/></i>Hyeri starred in the recently wrapped up <b>tvN</b> drama '<b>Miss Lee</b>'.</p>
