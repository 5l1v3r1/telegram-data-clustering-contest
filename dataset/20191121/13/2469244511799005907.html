      <p>An autistic man has admitted trying to groom and meet under age girls after being trapped by two different paedophile hunting groups.</p>
      <p>Dale Woolner was already being investigated for the first attempt to chat up a teenager when he fell for a second sting by the South Devon based group Totnes Justice.</p>
      <p>He was filmed by members of three groups as he arrived to meet what he thought would be a 14-year-old girl who had travelled 200 miles to Exeter to have sex with him.</p>
      <p>He was intercepted outside John Lewis in Sidwell Street after giving the decoy who was posing as the girl details of where he would be and what he would be wearing. He even told her that he walked with a crutch.</p>
      <p>Woolner was trapped by Totnes Justice and the North West Hebephile Hunting group when he made contact with decoys posing as 14-year-old girls last month.</p>
      <p>He was confronted for the first time on October 15, when evidence was passed to the police. He made contact with another decoy again and was stung for a second time.</p>
      <p>Members of Totnes Justice and the NWHHG were joined by activists from the UK Database and filmed a 13 minute confrontation outside John Lewis in Exeter on the evening of October 22.</p>
      <p>He was expecting to meet a 14-year-old girl called Emily and it was clear from the messages he had sent her over the previous eight days that he expected them to have full sex.</p>
      <p>Woolner, aged 43, of Eton Drive, Exeter, admitted arranging or facilitating a child sex offence and attempting to incite a child to sexual activity between September 30 and October 15.</p>

      <p>He also admitted attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming on October 22. The charge specifies that he made contact with 'Emily' on at least two occasions and intended to have penetrative sex with her.</p>
      <p>Judge Timothy Rose adjourned sentence until next month and remanded Woolner in custody. He warned him that all options, including immediate imprisonment, remain open.</p>
      <p>Mr William Parkhill, defending, said Woolner has no serious offences in the past and suffers from serious autism.</p>
