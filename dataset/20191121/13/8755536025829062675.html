      <p>Lewis Capaldi has revealed he wrote his heartbreaking new song, Before You Go, about his aunt taking her own life.</p>
      <p>The Scottish singer released the song earlier this week, and described it as “one of the most personal songs” he’s ever written.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio, he explained: “The song’s kind of, it comes from a place of… it’s about suicide and it’s about not necessarily the act of it itself obviously, but people after it happens.”</p>
      <p>“The aftermath of it and people blaming themselves or starting to think, what could I have done to help that person?”</p>

      <p>“When I was about five or six, I think, my aunt committed suicide and just remember recently speaking to my mum about their feelings, her feelings about going through that sort of rigmarole in your head of, ‘What could I have done here? Could I have done anything?'”</p>
      <p>“But she said it was the thing of, at first you’re angry. You’re obviously upset and then you kind of get angry at them, and then you get angry at yourself. She said it was this whole kind of … it’s very, very strange,” Lewis said.</p>
      <p>Lewis released his new song just one day before he received his first Grammy nomination.</p>
      <p>His hit song ‘Someone You Loved’ is up for Song of the Year, going up against Taylor Swift’s ‘Lover’, Billie Eilish’s ‘Bad Guy’, Lizzo’s ‘Truth Hurts’, and Lady Gaga’s ‘Always Remember Us This Way’.</p>
