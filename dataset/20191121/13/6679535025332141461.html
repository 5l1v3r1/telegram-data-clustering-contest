      <p>The first-ever India and U.S. armed forces tri-services exercise ‘Tiger Triumph’ concluded off the Kakinada coast, East Godavari district, with a grand closing ceremony onboard the U.S. Navy ship Germantown on Thursday.</p>
      <p>This was the first tri-services exercise by both countries on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), which was held from November 13 to 21.</p>
      <p>During the exercise, Indian and U.S. forces jointly transited from Visakhapatnam to the simulated HADR location at Kakinada. In Kakinada, the troops were transferred ashore and set up a joint command and control centre and a joint relief and medical camp.</p>
      <p>Apart from Indian Navy ship INS Jalashwa and U.S. Navy ship USS Germantown, over 500 US Marines and sailors and 1,200 Indian soldiers and officers participated in the exercise.</p>
      <p>Apart from HADR, the exercise included live fire drills, ship manoeuvrers, and landings by Indian helicopters on the Germantown’s flight deck.</p>
      <h3>Personal relationship</h3>
      <p>U.S. Marine Corps First Lieutenant Tori Sharpe noted: “Exercise Tiger Triumph enhanced U.S.-India military-to-military relations and honed individual and small-unit skills in the context of a HADR scenario. It exposed Indian and U.S. forces to different training environments, weaponry and tactics. Through training side-by-side and sharing best practices, both Indian and U.S. troops not only learned from one another but also established personal and professional relationships.”</p>
      <p>Acting U.S. Consul-General to Hyderabad Eric Alexander said: “India's role as a stabilizing power in the region is critical for trade and transit between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. India and the United States have a shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region that provides prosperity and security for all.”</p>
