      <p>Astell&amp;Kern has unveiled a portable hi-res audio player designed for those who enjoy the finer things in life. Pitched as the Dom Perignon of pocket-sized audio, the swish new <a href="https://www.astellnkern.com/eng/content/shop/features.asp?mcg=CG110000&amp;mpos=0&amp;scg=CG210240&amp;spos=4&amp;tcg=&amp;tpos=0&amp;gcode=SC35860">SA700 (Â£1295)</a> features an elegant industrial design inspired by the iconic AK120, and combines an angular steel body with a 4.1in 720x1280 touchscreen to create a device that feels both vintage and modern. In terms of audio, the SA700 uses a Dual DAC system, comprised of two AKM AK4492ECB DACs, to deliver "incredible sonic performance." The player supports bit-to-bit playback up to 32-bit, 384KHz and native DSD playback up to 11.2MHz, meaning your favourite tunes should sound as close to the original production as possible. 128GB of built-in storage might not sound like a lot when you're talking about hi-res audio, but support for an extra 512GB through a microSD card slot should quell those fears.</p>
