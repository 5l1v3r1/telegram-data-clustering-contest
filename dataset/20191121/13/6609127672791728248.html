      <p>The attacker, who has played 12 games in all competitions, has scored seven goals and provided six assists so far this campaign.</p>
      <p>Elyounoussi, who was named Ladbrokes Player of the Month for October, admits he hasn't really thought about his long-term future.</p>
      <p>But says he's enjoying his time with Neil Lennon's men.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Ladbrokes social club, he said: "Yeah I mean for now it's not up to me. The clubs have to talk.</p>

      <p>"I am really happy here. Celtic is an amazing club but I haven't really thought about my future yet.</p>
      <p>"I just think about the next training, next game and do my best.</p>
      <p>"In the summer we will see where we go."</p>
      <p>Elyounoussi was sent home by Norway over the international break with a foot injury.</p>
      <p>He is a doubt for the clash with Livingston on Saturday but should be ready for Rennes in the Europa League next week.</p>

      <p>He added: "I picked it up a couple of weeks ago against Hibs in the semi-final.</p>
      <p>"It's been a bit painful since then and hasn't really had the time to heal.</p>
      <p>"With a little rest and some treatments I should be alright."</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old, who arrived at <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> on summer deadline day, has revealed <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4978003/mohamed-elyounoussi-stuart-armstrong-celtic-loan/">ex-Celt Stuart Armstrong helped him decide to join the club. </a></p>
      <p>The Scotland international was gushing in his praise for his old club as he and Elyounoussi sat next to each other at the club's Staplewood training base.</p>
      <p>He also sought advice from Norway team-mate Kris Ajer and Fraser Forster.</p>
      <p>He said: “Stuart told me so many good things about Celtic.</p>
      <p>“I had also spoken with Kris Ajer so I had a good knowledge of what I was coming into. I didn’t look at it as a step down. I needed to get minutes on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“I feel Celtic have brought my confidence back. I am scoring goals and I’m really happy. I know the quality I have and I think the manager knows that as well.</p>
      <p>“So with his belief and trust in me and the help of the coaches too, I feel I am bringing what I can to the team.”</p>
