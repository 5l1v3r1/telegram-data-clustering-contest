      <p><i>The Turning</i>, which stars <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/stranger-things">Stranger Things’</a> </i>Finn Wolfhard and <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/black-mirror">Black Mirror’s</a> </i>Mackenzie Davis, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/finn-wolfhard-the-turning-new-film-adaptation-henry-james-trailer-2555756">is inspired by the Henry James ghostly short story, <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>, and will be released in cinemas on January 24.</a></p>
      <p>The soundtrack for the film, which is made up entirely of original tracks and will also be released on January 24, features an array of artists alongside Love including <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/mitski">Mitski</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/soccor-mommy">Soccer Mommy</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/warpaint">Warpaint</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/kali-uchis">Kali Uchis</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/kim-gordon">Kim Gordon</a> and Finn Wolfhard’s new band, The Aubreys. You can see a complete list of artists and the track listing below.</p>
      <p>The soundtrack, <a href="https://theturning.lnk.to/Mother">which you can pre-order here</a>, came together after the film’s director asked Lawrence Rothman to write an original song for the film. Lawrence in turn went to Love, who he knew was a fan of the short story.</p>

      <p>Love said: “I read <i>The Turn of the Screw</i> as a kid, so it’s a genuine privilege to have had the opportunity to work with the genius that is Floria Sigismondi and Lawrence Rothman on this soundtrack – especially as I’m alongside so many other fantastic female artists I respect.</p>
      <p>“I’ve long admired her work, particularly The Runaways and the Marilyn Manson videos. Floria and Lawrence had a clear vision on what they wanted to achieve and it was an honor to be invited into their studio and to become a part of it.”</p>
      <p>The rest of the artists were assembled when Lawrence called in producer Yves Rothman. Speaking about the soundtrack, Lawrence says: “We were both inspired by the classic 90’s soundtracks – <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Lost Highway,</i> <i>The Crow,</i> the sessions were chaotic and inspired, it was a fever dream for months.</p>
      <p>“Yves and I are beyond ecstatic to have worked with so many of our favourite artists.”</p>
