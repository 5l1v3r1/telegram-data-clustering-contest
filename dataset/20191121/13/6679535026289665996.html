      <p>Sage Parasara, author of Vishnu Purana, argues that the name Bhagavan is apt only in the case of Lord Vasudeva, said P.T. Seshadri, in a discourse. If the word Bhagavan is split into its components — bha+ ga+va, the appropriateness of Bhagavan as a name for Vasudeva becomes evident. Bha means He who makes the world function and He who protects everything. When the world was not in existence, only Bhagavan was there. And He made the world. ‘Ga’ means He who does everything, He who creates and destroys. ‘Va’ means He in whom all bhutas reside and He who resides in all bhutas. None but Lord Vasudeva can lay claim to all these qualities. Hence Bhagavan refers to Vasudeva.</p>
      <p>There is another reason why none but Vasudeva can be Bhagavan. Only He who has Sri can be called Bhagavan, and Vasudeva’s Consort is Sri. So, this is another reason why no one else can be called Bhagavan in the true sense of the word. Ramanujacharya, in his Vedartha Sangraha, establishes that Bhagavan is none other than Lord Narayana. While explaining the name Bhagavan in his commentary on Vishnu Sahasranama, Sankara Bhagavadpada says Bhagavan is the One with six auspicious qualities like aiswarya. Parasara Bhatta, in his commentary, says Bhagavan is the One who has only auspicious qualities. There is another name ‘bhagaha’, which Parasara Bhatta explains as the One with qualities like aiswarya etc, and as the One who has Lakshmi.</p>
      <p>Azhvars in their verses talk of Vishnu as ‘Adi’ — the One without a beginning. The akshara ‘a’ indicates Vishnu- akarArthO Vishnuh. In the Gita, Lord Krishna says aksharANAm akArOsmi — among the aksharas, I am ‘a.’ Since He is Bhagavan, the Gita, which came from Him is prefixed with the word ‘Bhagavad.’</p>
