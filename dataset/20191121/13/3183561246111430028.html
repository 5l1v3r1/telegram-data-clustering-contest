      <p>MacBooks rarely come very far down in price so now's a good time to buy into the Apple ecosystem with this now-discontinued 12-inch model. It's being sold for more than a $2000 in other retailers so it's certainly a great price for the specs (and it's Apple, you're <i>always</i> going to pay more).</p>

      <p>Usually retailing for <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/au/shop/versa-lite">$249.95</a>, the Versa Lite gives you what you the basics of smartwatch workouts for a more affordable price. You won't be able to submerge this one or house all your tunes on it like the Versa 2 but it will still give you your steps, the time, your heartrate and all the other regular features. Sadly, only the bright blue and purple bands are under the $200 mark while the more subtle white and grey bands will cost you a little more.</p>
