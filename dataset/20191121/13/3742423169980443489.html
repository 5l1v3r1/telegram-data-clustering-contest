      <p>You never want to encounter dry turkey in your holiday meals. One of the easiest ways to prevent this horror is to cook the big-arse bird with a precision cooker but, thanks to a large hole where its insides used to be, keeping a whole turkey submerged is usually <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/11/will-it-sous-vide-a-whole-turkey">quite the challenge</a>. To overcome the buoyancy, you could chop the turkey into quarters, or you <i>fill the cavity with stock</i>.</p>
      <p>Shamefully, this is not a solution I came up with using the power of my brain. No, this clever turkey workaround (<i>ed note: turk-</i><i>around</i>) was put into this world by Cole Wagoner of Anova, whomst I met at a <a href="https://www.theisva.org/summit2019">precision cooking conference</a>. (You’ve never heard of a precision cooking conference? Let me assure you it is a very cool and happening event that very cool and happening people attend.)</p>
      <p>Anyway. Cole and I were talking about precision cooking (obviously) and the subject of turkey came up. He casually, as if he were <i>not</i> a genius, mentioned <a href="https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-whole-turkey">his precision cooked turkey recipe</a>, which calls for the cook to fill the hollow insides of the bird with two quarts of chicken stock, vanquishing the dreaded bird bob.</p>
      <p>The bird stays completely submerged in a water bath for 24 hours, after which it is removed, patted dry, then crisped up in a 230-degree oven. Cole cooks his bird at 65 degrees Celsius, which is ideal for breast meat, but I bet you could crank it to 70 degrees for the sake of the thighs. I doubt the breast would dry out—it is, after all, in a very moist cooking environment (especially with all that stock).</p>
