      <h1>5 Crucial matches Chelsea will Play before the end of 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:20:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">James Porter</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea picked up the pace after the not-so-great start of the season. The club won its last six matches in the Premier League and still has the chance to enter the final stages of the UEFA Champions League.</p>
      <p>The holiday season is famous for tight schedules and many games to play. What matches are crucial for Chelsea until the end of 2019? Take a look below to see the games where our players will have to show what they are made of if they aim for success this season!</p>
      <p>We wouldn’t advise betting on these matches since many of them will probably be tight contests. Instead, visit <a href="https://holymolycasinos.com/">holymolycasinos</a> and find an online casino to play and win at slots, roulette, and other games!</p>
      <h3>Manchester City – Chelsea (23rd November 2019)</h3>
      <p>The first big test is right around the corner as the club will play at Etihad Stadium at the weekend. The reigning champions are not enjoying the start of the season they were hoping for, and they are currently at fourth spot in the Premier League with 25 points.</p>
      <p>Chelsea is in the third position with a point more than Manchester City, and avoiding a loss is crucial to keep that advantage. Since this is one of the trickiest away games in the entire season, nobody demands a victory. However, it is imperative for the young Chelsea team to put in a great performance against the champions. And if they continue the six wins in a row streak, it will only be a bonus.</p>
      <h3>Valencia – Chelsea (27th November 2019)</h3>
      <p>It is going to be a hectic week for manager Frank Lampard and his players. As soon as they finish the match against Manchester City, the team is heading for Spain to play against Valencia in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
      <p>Chelsea and Valencia play in Group H, and both these teams and Ajax have seven points so far. With two matches to go, it is critical to play a good match against a direct rival for a place in the knockout stages.</p>

      <h3>Chelsea – Lille (10th December 2019)</h3>
      <p>You may think this is a match that Chelsea needs to win, but the team mustn’t take Lille for granted. These two clubs will play at Stamford Bridge in the final round of the UEFA Champions League group phase.</p>
      <p>A lot will depend on the score against Valencia, but a win against Lille is imperative either way. It will ensure that the team keeps the best odds of playing in continental competitions after the winter break.</p>
      <h3>Tottenham Hotspur – Chelsea (22nd December 2019)</h3>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur is having a nightmare season, and Jose Mourinho arrived to turn things around. He will have more than a month to improve the team’s position, but there is a good reason why we believe Chelsea has the chance of getting a good result despite playing away.</p>
      <p>The match against Tottenham will come after an eight-day break. It will be the first time that Chelsea won’t have to play a mid-week match after almost two months. That means the players will get the chance to rest, and Lampard and the staff can prepare the right tactics for the match.</p>
      <h3>Arsenal – Chelsea (29th December 2019)</h3>
      <p>Match against Arsenal will be the closing game of 2019 for both teams. It is needless to say that it would be great to enter 2020, knowing that you won against big rivals. Arsenal is currently far away from the top four positions, but they might improve their form until this game.</p>
      <p>Avoiding a negative result is imperative to put a dent in the rival’s hopes to fight for the Champions League spot. It will also be a boost of confidence for the upcoming year, which brings many new challenges for Chelsea.</p>
