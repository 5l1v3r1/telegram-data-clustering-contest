      <h1>Marcelo Bielsa provides update on Leeds loanee Eddie Nketiah</h1>

        <b>Marcelo Bielsa has suggested that Eddie Nketiah is back in training and will start working with the Leeds United squad again next week, <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/marcelo-bielsa-press-conference-live-17292406">in comments reported by Leeds Live</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nketiah has been absent for Leeds’s last two games. It had appeared that he was on course to make his first league start for the Whites when Bielsa’s men faced Queens Park Rangers.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.leedsunited.com/news/team-news/25737/eddie-nketiah-to-miss-qpr-game">But the club announced in the hours before the game</a> that he had suffered an abdominal injury. There has been little word officially regarding how long the Arsenal loanee is expected to be out for.</p>
      <p>But ahead of this weekend’s clash with Luton Town, Bielsa confirmed that Nketiah is making progress. And he suggested that he will step his recovery up next week.</p>

      <p>“Nketiah is not ready yet. Next week he is going to start to work with the group,” he said, <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/marcelo-bielsa-press-conference-live-17292406">as reported by Leeds Live</a>.</p>
      <p>“He is training. It’s different when you train to when you train with the group and after it is necessary to consider the time he was without training. For instance, Dallas played on Saturday, five days ago and Cooper 12 days ago,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Different situations between Dallas and Cooper. After Eddie starts to train with the group, he will be ready to compete. One thing is being healthy and another being ready to compete.”</p>
      <p>It was a huge blow for Nketiah to sustain an injury. His performance against Sheffield Wednesday in October was arguably his best since his arrival. And it did appear that he was going to start against QPR.</p>
      <p>In his absence, Patrick Bamford has continued to do well. And it would be no surprise if Nketiah needs to wait a while longer to force his way into the starting lineup.</p>
      <p>It is fantastic for Leeds to have Nketiah making his way back. The Whites face nine games before the turn of the year, and having both options available will certainly boost their chances of coming through the Christmas period in good shape.</p>
