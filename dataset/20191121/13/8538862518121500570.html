      <p>Cloud saves on PlayStation 4 are just about serviceable at best, aren't they? Uploaded in the background while you're playing the latest game, it's never too much of a hassle. That'll all well and good, but reports have come and gone over the past five years of community struggles when you really start to dig into the feature. That's why <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-need-to-improve-cloud-saves-for-the-ps5-because-they-are-currently-terrible.154403/">gaming forum ResetEra</a> is calling on Sony to improve cloud saves for its next-generation system.</p>
      <p>Contained to a single thread at the time of writing, users are sharing the numerous issues they have had with cloud saves during the PS4 generation. When the recent <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a> produces far <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/death_stranding_save_data_can_balloon_in_size_if_you_dont_keep_it_in_check">too many autosaves</a>, the cloud's hard cap on 1000 uploaded saves starts to become a bit of a problem, while posters have reported losing all of their supposedly backed-up saves at random intervals. It also becomes a bit of a hassle when someone has two PS4 consoles in the house, and in order to transfer save data between the two, they'll have to mess about with primary system activation settings.</p>
      <p>It's not the biggest issue Sony needs to solve when it comes to designing the UI and features of the PlayStation 5, but it's a quality of life improvement that would go a long way to justifying the cost of PlayStation Plus that little bit more.
