        <b>Footpad made the perfect start to his campaign with a facile success in the Boomerang.ie Chase at Thurles.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The seven-year-old looked another superstar in the making for the Willie Mullins team after winning each of his five starts as a novice over fences two seasons ago - a run which included a brilliant display in the Arkle Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
      <p>However, having failed to rediscover that form in three underwhelming displays last term, Footpad was on something of a recovery mission on his reappearance in Count Tipperary - and did not disappoint on his return from a 252-day absence.</p>
      <p>Sent off the 8/11 favourite, Footpad was settled in third for much of the two-mile-six-furlong journey by Daryl Jacob, as Jetz and the 2018 Ryanair Chase hero Balko Des Flos disputed the lead.</p>
      <p>Footpad was always travelling and jumping with enthusiasm in behind and once given his head, he swept to the front with the minimum of fuss.</p>

      <p>Mala Beach came from further back to try to throw down a challenge in the straight, but Footpad never looked in any danger of being caught and passed the post with 10 lengths in hand.</p>
      <p>Jacob said: "It is lovely to see the horse back on the racetrack and he had plenty of enthusiasm and jumped and travelled very, very well. It's a great starting point for him and he never missed a beat the whole way around.</p>
      <p>"Today's trip wasn't a problem for him and ideally going a little bit quicker early doors would have suited him, but he is nice and fresh and it was good to see a performance like that this early in the year.</p>
      <p>"It was mission accomplished today."</p>
