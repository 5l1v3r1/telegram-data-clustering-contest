      <h1>Allying with Sena is like burying Cong: Sanjay Nirupam</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:17:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/mrityunjay-bose-0" target="_blank">Mrityunjay Bose </a></address>
      <p>Hours before Uddhav Thackeray meets his legislators, the anti-Shiv Sena sentiments within the Congress grew wider with veteran Sanjay Nirupam speaking out again. </p>
      <p>Nirupam, a three-time MP, who had been with Shiv Sena earlier, said that alliance for the Congress with the right-wing saffron party would be disastrous. </p>
      <p>"Years ago, the Congress allied with (Mayawati-led) BSP in Uttar Pradesh. They (Congress) party got a beating and it has not been able to stand again (in UP)," Nirupam,  a former Mumbai Congress president said.</p>
      <p>According to him, the party is making the same mistake in Maharashtra. "Becoming the No.3 party in a Shiv Sena-led government is like buying the Congress (in Maharashtra)," he said.</p>
      <p>Nirupam said that Congress president Sonia Gandhi should not come under pressure for an alliance with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra.</p>
