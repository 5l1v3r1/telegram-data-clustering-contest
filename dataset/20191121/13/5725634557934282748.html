      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Valuation metrics in utilities.</li>
        <li>Evolution since last month.</li>
        <li>A list of stocks looking cheap in their industries.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This article series provides a monthly dashboard of industries in each sector of the GICS classification. It compares valuation and quality factors relative to their historical averages in each industry.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Executive summary</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Power producers/traders have mixed valuation metrics: price/sales is good and price/earnings is rather bad. They are above the historical average in profitability measured in return on equity. Other industries in the sector are significantly overpriced.</p>
      <p>Since last month:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>P/E and P/S have improved in utilities, except a deterioration in power producers/traders.</li>
        <li>ROE has improved in gas utilities, electric utilities, multi-utilities and deteriorated a bit in water utilities, power producers/traders.</li>
        <li>The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLU">XLU</a>) has lagged the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY">SPY</a>) by 4.6%.</li>
        <li>On this period, the best-performing S&amp;P 500 Utilities stocks are AES Corp. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AES">AES</a>), Evergy Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EVRG">EVRG</a>), PPL Corp. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPL">PPL</a>), Southern Company (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SO">SO</a>).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Some cheap stocks in their industries</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The stocks listed below are in the S&amp;P 1500 index, cheaper than their respective industry factor for price/earnings and price/sales. The 10 companies with the highest return on equity are kept in the final selection. I update every month several lists like this in various sectors. The list was published for subscribers at the beginning of the month based on data available at this time. This is not investment advice. Do your own research before buying.</p>

      <p>I take 3 aggregate industry factors: price/earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return on equity (ROE). My choice has been justified <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3490166-value-investors-the-best-valuation-ratio-may-not-be-what-you-think">here</a> and <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3510286-value-investors-the-best-ratios-may-not-be-what-you-think-part-2">here</a>. Their calculation aims at limiting the influence of outliers and large caps. They are reference values for stock picking, not for capital-weighted indices.</p>
      <p>For each factor, I calculate the difference with its own historical average: to the average for valuation ratios, from the average for ROE, so that the higher is always the better. The difference is measured in percentage for valuation ratios, not for ROE (already in percentage).</p>
      <p>The next table reports the 3 industry factors. There are 3 columns for each factor: the current value, the average (“Avg”) between January 1999 and October 2015 taken as an arbitrary reference of fair valuation, and the difference explained above (“D-xxx”).</p>

      <p>* Averages since 2005</p>
      <p>The following charts give an idea of the current status of two valuation factors (P/E, P/S) and a quality factor (ROE) relative to their historical average in each industry. For all factors, the difference to average is calculated in the direction where positive is good. For valuation ratios lower is better, for ROE higher is better. On the charts below, higher is always better.</p>

      <p>Most of my stock holdings are based on quantitative value models. However, value is a bad timing indicator. Quantitative Risk &amp; Value (QRV) provides you with a more realistic quantitative approach, for a world of probabilities instead of just risk on/risk off. It includes a systemic risk indicator and strategies based on it. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_66"><b>Get started</b></a> with a two-week free trial and see how QRV can improve your investing decisions.</p>
