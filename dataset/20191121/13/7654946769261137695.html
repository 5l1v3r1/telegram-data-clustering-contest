      <h1>Prince Andrew’s ‘alibi’ doubts royal’s explanation of key trip in Jeffrey Epstein scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:34:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:34</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Brown</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew faced further humiliation Thursday when his alibi for a key New York trip in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal was shot down by the former diplomat whom he said he had stayed with, according to a report.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York has been accused by Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/virginia-roberts-giuffre-says-prince-andrew-should-go-to-jail-over-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">having sex with her in the late moneyman’s Upper East Side mansion</a> in April 2001 when she was just 17.</p>
      <p>Andrew insisted during his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/devine-no-honor-in-prince-andrews-self-pity-over-epstein-friendship/">“car crash” of an interview with the BBC</a> that the allegations were impossible — because he was “staying with the consul-general” during that particular Manhattan trip.</p>
      <p>However, Sir Thomas Harris, the consul-general in New York at the time, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7708371/Britains-ex-consul-general-New-York-casts-doubt-dukes-alibi.html">told the Daily Mail</a> that he had “no recollection” of the prince staying at his official residence during that trip.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t sound as if he stayed with me,” Harris, who served in New York from 1999 to 2004, told the paper. “I don’t recall him staying with me.”</p>
      <p>Harris, 74, admitted he no longer had a copy of his 2001 diary. However, he stressed that such overnight stays by senior royals tend to be formally registered in the Court Circular.</p>

      <p>No such stays are listed for that period, which “makes me suspect he wasn’t with me that night,” Harris told the paper.</p>
      <p>“If you go through the Court Circular, you will come across the other visits he paid to New York. That was the typical pattern,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t ring any bell whatsoever,” he said of the 2001 trip.</p>
      <p>Giuffre has insisted in court filings that convicted pedophile Epstein forced her to have sex with Andrew at least three times, including the April 2001 New York trip.</p>

      <p>The Court Circular from the time shows the prince flew to New York on the morning of April 9, a flight that would have landed in New York just after lunchtime — with no duties listed for the rest of the day, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/19/duke-had-hours-unaccompanied-new-york-visit-virginia-roberts/?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_hootsuite&amp;utm_source=tmgoff_socialteam&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_content=2bc9848d-9ba8-47a8-aea0-b952d3449bdc&amp;utm_campaign=telegraph">according to the Telegraph</a>, noting gaps in his schedule during the trip.</p>
      <p>The same day Andrew arrived, his accuser, Giuffre, also flew into New York on Epstein’s private jet, the Telegraph said, citing flight logs.</p>
      <p>Andrew admitted he “probably did” visit close pal Epstein during the trip, but said there was “definitely no activity” because he did not sleep over.</p>
      <p>“Because of what I was doing, I was staying with the consul-general, which is further down the street on Fifth,” Andrew told the BBC in the interview that aired Saturday.</p>
      <p>“So I wasn’t staying there,” he said of Epstein’s mansion. “I may have visited, but no, definitely didn’t, definitely, definitely, no, no, no activity.”</p>
      <p>Andrew used his interview to once again adamantly deny the accusations against him.</p>
