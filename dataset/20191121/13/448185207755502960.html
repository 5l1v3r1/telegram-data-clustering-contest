      <p><b>Kolkata</b><b>:</b> Picking the pink ball after it crosses the batsman is a challenge wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha is looking to tackle when India takes on Bangladesh in the first-ever Day-Night Test at Eden Gardens from Friday.</p>
      <p>The pink ball, as opposed to the traditional red one, has more lacquer for better visibility, especially during twilight. The extra coating of lacquer is expected to make the ball wobble more which in twilight could be a problem for the stumper to pick. Asked what would be the challenge as a wicket-keeper in pink-ball Test, Saha said: “Picking the ball is challenging. If it is challenging for slips, it is for me as well as I stand beside them. The ball wobbles as our pacers bowl. That could be a factor but I have to accept the challenges. We are professionals.” Saha has first-hand experience of day-night cricket with the pink ball when local giants Mohun Bagan and Bhowanipore Club played the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)’s Super League final at the Eden in 2016.
