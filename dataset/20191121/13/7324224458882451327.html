      <p>The Holmcroft play area is the latest park set to be upgraded in Stafford Borough, with facilities including outdoor gym equipment, a concrete wheeled sports zone and a multi use games area in the pipeline for residents.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Staffordshire County Council agreed to transfer part of the land at the rear of Holmcroft Library to Stafford Borough Council to assist with the re-development of the sports and recreation facilities.</p>
      <p>And on Tuesday a full meeting of Stafford Borough Council agreed to allocate £85,577 towards the project, in addition to the £398,000 previously approved for the project in October.</p>
      <p>Councillor Carolyn Trowbridge, cabinet member for leisure told the meeting: “This is another good news story along with Victoria Park and all the other parks we are investing in in the borough.”</p>
      <p>The extra money – known as Section 106 funding – has come from a developer following the granting of planning permission for a housing development off Wootton Drive.</p>
      <p>Councillor Bryan Cross, ward councillor for Holmcroft, said: “This extra 106 money in the pipeline will enable the neighbourhood park being built in Holmcroft to have enhanced facilities – it is an ideal opportunity.</p>
      <h3>Excited</h3>
      <p>“We had a nice budget of £398,000 and this extra £85,000 will give us enough money to put in extra things like the outdoor gym.”</p>
      <p>Fellow ward councillor Jonathan Price said: “We have been working on this for some years now and it just goes to show the borough council does deliver good projects in the community. I’m really excited about this project and I want to see it to fruition.</p>
      <p>“I welcome this report – this additional money is the difference between a great park and an absolutely outstanding park.”</p>
      <p>The concept plan for the new facilities has been developed based on the results of a consultation with Holmcroft residents and schools which took place last year and it is hoped the project will be completed in 2021.</p>
      <p>The improvements are set to improve the playground equipment suitable for a range of ages from toddlers to young teenagers; outdoor gym equipment; wildlife zones; natural play elements and opportunities; and picnic and seating areas.</p>
      <p>The tennis courts are set to become a multi use games area, while the existing BMX area will be replaced with a concrete wheeled sports zone. The football pitches will be retained.</p>
      <p>Improvements to paths, walking routes and bins are also proposed. alongside soft landscape features, and the area is set to be dementia-friendly.</p>
