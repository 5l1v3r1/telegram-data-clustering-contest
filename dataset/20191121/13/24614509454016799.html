      <h2>As PINS stock moves closer to its IPO price, what’s next?</h2>

      <p><b>Pinterest</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pins-stock-quote/"><b>PINS</b></a>) stock was down to $19.67 on Nov. 19. This is putting the PINS stock price within striking distance of the $19 price per share from its initial public offering (IPO). PINS stock has suffered a steep decline since it released its last earnings report on Oct. 31.</p>

      <p>The company issued an earnings surprise of 1 cent per share in earnings which exceeded analysts’ expectations for a 15 cent per share loss in the quarter. Revenue was a different story. The stock was still up over 47% on a year-over-year basis but was lower than analysts’ expectations.</p>
      <p><i>InvestorPlace</i> contributor Luke Lango <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/buy-pinterest-stock-on-the-post-earnings-plunge/">made a case that the selloff was overdone</a>. And Will Ashworth also <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/pinterest-stock-is-a-steal-below-19/">made the buy case</a> as PINS stock price approaches $19. Both writers make a bullish case for why Pinterest stock may very well be undervalued. And reading their arguments, I don’t disagree. But that still doesn’t sell me on the stock.</p>
      <h3>Pinterest Is a Window Shoppers’ Dream</h3>
      <p>This is not meant to be sarcastic or derogatory. In fact, I admire it. Much of social media is about writing, describing and explaining your story. But not Pinterest. This is a purely visual medium. In fact, they describe themselves as a “visual search engine.”  Best practices even suggest business users limit their use of hashtags on their “pins,” which is Pinterest’s description of tweets or posts.</p>
      <p>I think this is one of the reasons it’s a well-liked medium. We live in a visual society. And Pinterest is a focused, easy-to-use site that doesn’t require us to respond, just to react.</p>
      <p>And better still, in a social media space where <b>Facebook </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/fb-stock-quote/"><b>FB</b></a>) is trying to look more like Instagram which is trying to look more like…well…Pinterest, PINS is just doing what it does. And they do it well.</p>
      <p>In a way they’re more like <b>Alphabet’s</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/goog-stock-quote/"><b><u>GOOG</u></b></a>, NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/googl-stock-quote/"><b>GOOGL</b></a>) Google than like Facebook or Instagram. And like Google, Pinterest relies on ad revenues to make money. The thing is, it’s working. The company is not yet profitable on a full-year basis, but they did eke out an earnings beat in the last quarter. And the fourth quarter is typically Pinterest’s most active quarter, so I would expect that revenue will increase as the monthly active user base goes up.</p>
      <p>I understand how Pinterest makes money. I just wonder how much money there is to be made without changing the fundamental character of what makes the site so loved.</p>
      <h3>Ultimately, Pinterest Is an Idea</h3>
      <p>Pinterest has a large and growing base of users. And it has a distinct brand identity from other social media sites. Around <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/does-pinterest-have-a-moat.aspx">90% of users say they associate the brand with positivity</a> (if that can be measured). But finding ideas and turning those ideas into purchases are two different things.</p>
      <p>Which is where my questions arise. At its core, Pinterest is a whole site built around ideas, none of which the business actually owns. Which means those ideas could, in theory, go elsewhere. Or they could make the company a tempting acquisition.</p>
      <p>I don’t know if I would call that a moat.</p>
      <p>In an effort to be completely transparent, I would not fall into Pinterest’s target audience. Not because their audience is over 70% female (although that would be an obvious reason). But it’s more that I can easily get social media fatigue. For me, Pinterest doesn’t make the cut. Which I suppose as someone who likes to write, makes sense.</p>
      <p>Pinterest is a beloved brand. And that can take it a long way. But there was no Pinterest before Pinterest. And now that there’s a Pinterest, I expect that there will be others trying to climb into the space. Is there anything to stop one from doing so?</p>
      <p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it could be the kiss of death for Pinterest stock.</p>
