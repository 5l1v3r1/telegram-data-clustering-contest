      <h1>Premier League star desperately wants Barcelona move</h1>

      <h3>Chelsea Star Willian is keen on completing his rumoured switch to Barcelona in the coming January Transfer Window. As per <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/transfer-news/1200339/reports-barcelona-messi-valverde-target-willian-chelsea-transfer-decision-contract-talks-stall/"><b><i>Fox Sports</i></b></a>, the Brazilian is now desperate to join the Camp Nou.</h3>
      <p>It is no secret that Barcelona have had Willian on their radar for quite some time now. Moreover, it has only been a few weeks since the Midfielder admitted that the Catalans did indeed make an offer for him post the 2018 World Cup. However, it was rejected by the blues.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time that Chelsea have offers for Willian from the Blaugranes. A few months back, the Brazil international shocked the world when he refused to pen down a contract extension with the Blues. As per reports, he has been stalling down the deal in a bid to attract a deal that would see him head to the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde’s side have not been consistent in the midfield in recent times and it is quite visible. Since the team is undergoing a transitional change, it is quite natural that inconsistency will creep in. However, Willian has still got a few years left and his presence could help the youngsters for the better.</p>
      <p>La Liga’s defending champions should go for Willian as they will have a quality and experienced midfielder in the ranks. William is someone who can lead the attacking midfield and guide the potential star in Frenkie de Jong.</p>
