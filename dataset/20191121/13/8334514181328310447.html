      <p>BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour Party will fund a pay rise for workers and upgrades to national infrastructure by taxing the rich, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Thursday as he unveiled the party’s Dec 12. election manifesto.</p>
      <p>Corbyn said the manifesto was the most radical and ambitious plan to transform Britain’s economy in decades.</p>
      <p>“I accept the opposition of the billionaires because we will make those at the top pay their fair share of tax to help fund world class public services for you – that’s real change,” Corbyn said.</p>
      <p>“We will give Britain a pay rise starting with a real living wage of at least 10 pounds an hour.”</p>
