      <p>CHARLTON ATHLETIC HAVE announced the signing of versatile Republic of Ireland senior squad member Chloe Mustaki.</p>
      <p>The defender, who can also operate in midfield, made her debut for her new club in last night’s Continental Cup victory against London City Lionesses.</p>
      <p>“Chloe on her debut looked very composed and she’s only going to get better with match sharpness,” said Charlton Athletic manager Riteesh Mishra.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old most recently played for Shelbourne in the Women’s National League. She previously had spells with Peamount United, UCD Waves and Bordeaux.</p>
