      <p>Jetro Willems has revealed the role Gini Wijnaldum played in convincing him to join <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old made the season-long switch to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James' Park</a> in the summer, and there is a £10 million option at the end of the season for the Magpies to make the move from Eintracht Frankfurt permanent.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman has impressed on the left flank in the absence of Matt Ritchie, and has admitted in interview he was convinced to swap the Bundesliga for Premier League football on Tyneside by former Magpie Wijnaldum.</p>
      <p>The midfielder spent one season in black and white before leaving for Liverpool in 2016 following United's relegation.</p>

      <p>But despite the Magpies' difficulties on the pitch that season, Wijnaldum gave the club a glowing review to his fellow Dutchman.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Dutch title <a href="https://www.ad.nl/">Algemeen Dagblad</a> via <a href="https://www.fcupdate.nl/voetbalnieuws/359449/willems-geniet-bij-newcastle-united-en-dankt-wijnaldum/">FcUpdate.nl</a> , Willem said: “I spoke to Gini and he told me about Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"He said, ‘Believe me, Jetro. Go to Newcastle. A good city, warm people. A great atmosphere. Just do your thing and it’ll be fine’. I trusted [him].</p>
      <p>“If I wanted to achieve my goals and further develop myself in a more natural and trusted position, I had to do it somewhere else.</p>
      <p>“I am enjoying it. That is the most important thing. Sometimes you forget to enjoy the talent that you have been given, and the possibilities that you get. Now I do that again. I think you can see that in my game</p>
