      <p>Croatian Economy Minister Darko Horvat said the country's government is likely to discuss the issue of <b>Volkswagen</b> entering <b>Croatia</b> with Chancellor Angela Merkel, MIA reported.</p>
      <p>Although the production director of the concern, Andreas Tostmann, has recently said that the company it is not looking for alternative locations, according to <b>Croatia</b>, the government has prepared a proposal for the investment to be made in Croatia.</p>
      <p>The government has considered all the requirements of the automotive giant's management and has proposed three potential locations for the new plant that meet the requirements - Varazdin, Ivanic-Grad and Dugo Selo.</p>
      <p>"We are looking for ways for the government to step in to ensure that these three contracts are completed and goods are delivered, and then, after collecting payments, at least a portion of loans could be repaid," the minister said, adding that he had talked with several companies from Austria and Germany which might help.</p>
