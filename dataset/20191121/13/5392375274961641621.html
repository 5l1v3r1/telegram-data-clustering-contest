      <p>Right from the beginning of 2019, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a> revamped its entire market strategy specifically for the Indian market. Looking at the slipping grasp on the budget segment, the smartphone maker introduced the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/13/samsung-already-working-on-android-10-for-the-galaxy-m20-and-m30/">Galaxy M lineup</a> along with the updated<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/17/galaxy-a80-will-get-a-new-256gb-storage-variant/"> Galaxy A devices</a>. So far, the brand has launched a plethora of devices in both the series. Furthermore, the chaebol launched four Galaxy S devices along with two Galaxy Note devices this year for the very first time. It seems like the company still has a few more devices in stores for us including Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite.</p>
      <p>If the report is to be believed, Samsung is planning to launch three new devices in the Indian market. We’re looking at the Galaxy S10 Lite, Galaxy Note 10 Lite and a brand-new Galaxy A51 smartphone. On the contrary, the previous report suggested that the A51 will hit the market in 2020 while the S10 Lite will not see its India launch at all. The recent report also reveals that all three devices will see its official launch next month i.e. December 2019. The smartphone maker is not known for launching too many devices in December. Considering the 2019 strategy shift, we might indeed see the devices getting official.</p>
      <h3>Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite: Specs, Features</h3>
      <p>Recently, Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite made its <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/21/samsung-galaxy-s10-lite-appears-on-fcc-confirmed-to-use-a-6-7-inch-screen/">round on the FCC listing</a> revealing some key information.

The phone is backed by a 4370mAh battery and runs on Android 10.</p>
      <h3>Galaxy Note 10 Lite, Galaxy A51: Specs, Features</h3>
      <p>As of now, we don’t have much information on the Note 10 Lite smartphone. The device is said to come with a model number SM-N770F. As the name suggests, the device should be a cheaper alternative to the already launched Galaxy Note lineup. Unlike the Note 10 Lite, we know almost everything about the Galaxy A51 device.</p>
