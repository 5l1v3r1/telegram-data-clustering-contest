      <h1>The new Bristol Rovers hierarchy as chairman Steve Hamer departs</h1>
      <h2>Hamer had been at the club since 2016</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:19:13+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:19</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>It was announced today that Bristol Rovers chairman Steve Hamer has departed the club.</p>
      <p>Hamer had been in position since Dwane Sports took over <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> in 2016 <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-fans-speculate-over-3561597">but was a divisive figure among fans.</a></p>
      <p>Following his departure, here is the current hierarchy at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">the Gas</a> according to <a href="https://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/club/">their website</a> and Companies House.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Al-Qadi was made president of the club after Dwane Sports' takeover in 2016. The Jordanian is often seen at matches, and has previous footballing experience, having been a member of Prince Ali bin Hussein's bid to become FIFA president in February 2016.</p>
      <p>Al-Qadi worked closely with former manager Darrell Clarke, who spoke highly of the president on a personal level, even when <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-darrell-clarke-sacked-2307356">being critical of the club's board and owners towards the end of his reign last year.</a></p>
      <p>He has been the face of Dwane Sports at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> and recently defended their investment record at the Gas, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/club-president-wael-al-qadi-3427464">arguing that the club's owners are focused on sustainability</a> in order to not put Rovers' future at risk.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CEO: Martyn Starnes</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Martyn Starnes</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Starnes was appointed CEO in March 2018, beginning the role in July after serving out his notice period at Plymouth Argyle. He has also previously worked for Swindon Town and Yeovil Town.</p>
      <p>Al-Qadi explained that he had been keen to appoint a CEO since taking over at the club, and backed Starnes to help develop Rovers off the pitch, including with the academy.</p>
      <p>Since being appointed, Starnes has arguably been the most active member of the Rovers' hierarchy in the media, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-chief-martyn-starnes-2356722">including handling interviews following the departure of Darrell Clarke last season.</a></p>

        <b>Club board: Wael Al-Qadi, Martyn Starnes, Ken Masters, Mike Turner</b>

      </figure>
      <p>Al-Qadi and Starnes are naturally on the board due to their positions at the club.</p>
      <p>Masters is chairman of the trustees of Rovers' Community Trust and was appointed onto the club's board in 2006. He continued in his role as company director following Dwane Sports' acquisition of the club in 2016.Â  In 2014, the Telegraph described Masters as a "fans' director", and last year he explained to <a href="https://bristolroverssc.co.uk/director-ken-masters-report-to-our-agm/">Rovers' supporters club</a> that he is accountable to the chairman of the supporters' club and responsible to the chairman of the company.</p>
      <p>Turner is a director at law firm Taylor Wessing, who are listed in the role of 'secretary' on Rovers' Companies House page. He was appointed to Rovers' board in a non-executive capacity in 2016.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Commercial director: Tom Gorringe</b>

      </figure>
      <p>Gorringe took over as commercial director in September 2017, moving from Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He has proved to be a popular figure with fans, often interacting with them on Twitter - <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-new-kit-2020-3186883">including presenting a supporter with a pasty after they came up with the idea for Rovers' kit for this season.</a></p>
      <p>He has previously also worked at Portsmouth and Cardiff City and attends Rovers games both home and away. When Rovers announce a new sponsorship or commercial tie-up, Gorringe will be the member of the hierarchy who speaks to the media and club website about the deal.</p>

      <p>Moving onto the football side of things, Widdrington is head of recruitment at Rovers. He travels the length and breadth of the country - and sometimes overseas - to take in matches and keep a lookout for potential signings.</p>
      <p>The former Southampton midfielder joined Rovers in May 2018 after leaving a similar position at Coventry City. <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/tommy-widdrington-explains-how-bristol-2980363">He works closely with manager Graham Coughlan</a> and will often be planning one transfer window ahead in order to make sure the Gas secure their targets.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Manager: Graham Coughlan</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>With no director of football, Coughlan is in charge of the football identity at the club. Alongside on-the-pitch matters, Coughlan has worked to incorporate more youth into his first team and has spoken about wanting to develop a pathway from the academy into the first team. It has seen the likes of Alfie Kilgour, Rollin Menayese and Cam Hargreaves all involved in the senior side this season.</p>
      <p>Coughlan also works with Widdrington on recruitment and has <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/full-list-bristol-rovers-backroom-3304959">overseen a restructure in the Gas' backroom staff this season.</a></p>
