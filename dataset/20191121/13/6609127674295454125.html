        <b>I'M A Celebrity viewers have been left shocked at the lack of support Caitlyn Jenner has received from her family.</b>
      </p>
      <p>None of Caitlyn Jenner's family - from former wife Kris Jenner to daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner - have publicly discussed or shared love and support to their father during her time on the ITV show.</p>

      <p>The 70-year-old is currently taking part in the ITV show but has not had any mentions from her six biological kids and four step-children so far.</p>
      <p>One disgruntled fan shared: "I’m not saying that you have to put anything on social media to prove you care etc but not one of @Caitlyn_Jenner’s family members have said anything about her stint on #ImACeleb and its bothering the hell out of me."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Its literally breaking my heart that not a single member of Caitlyns family appear to be supporting her (sic). You're doing great Caitlyn! I am rooting for you!!</p>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner also has four other children from her previous marriage but son Brody Jenner admitted he would not be watching as he didn't know anything about the show.</p>

      <p>Brody – who has spoken candidly about having a strained relationship with his parent in the past - is Caitlyn’s youngest son with her second wife Linda Thomspon, with whom she also shares son Brandon.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner also has Burt and Cassandra from her first marriage to Chrystie Crownover and Kendall and Kylie with her last wife Kris, as well taking on Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian.</p>
      <p>When quizzed if he would be tuning in as he got juice in LA yesterday, Brody admitted: “I don’t even know what that is.”</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old has been subjected to two Bushtucker Trials on the ITV show already and broke down in tears on Monday, questioning what she was doing in the jungle.</p>

      <p>Brody was also asked if he thought Caitlyn would be OK in the jungle after she cried in the jungle, and the Hills star replied: “I don’t know. I hope so.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has already appeared in I'm A Celebrity in the US in 2003 before she transitioned into a woman, and she came in fourth place.</p>
      <p>Her partner Sophia Hutchins has thrown her support behind Caitlyn though, admitting she had been ready to mount a rescue mission and confront producers.</p>

      <p>Sophia, 23, who lives with Caitlyn in Malibu, chatted to Lorraine Kelly on Wednesday and said: "It hasn't been easy to watch at all when there is someone who is across the globe you kind of feel helpless to begin with.</p>
      <p>"When you throw in these challenges and she is crying, it has been gut wrenching to watch.</p>
      <p>"The producers take away everyone's phones so we don't have any way to contact her. It's tough".</p>
