      <h1>This age-old question gets up voters' noses unless there's an answer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Crowe</a></address>
      <p>Josh Frydenberg is not the first minister to gloss over the impact on real people from easy talk about high policy. He will certainly not be the last. Yet the roar of complaint from older Australians this week is a lesson about the danger of talking about problems when there is no solution in sight.</p>

      <p>Frydenberg and his fellow ministers should learn the lesson fast. Any challenge looks simpler in the tables of a budget paper than in the reality of a workplace or a Centrelink office where older workers feel their options have dried up.</p>
      <p>The brutal response to the Treasurer, in the comments from readers in these pages and on talkback radio, is that it is no use talking about Australians working longer in life if the government has no practical way to make it happen. That means its answers on age discrimination will count more than most of its talk about the Intergenerational Report early next year, the update on how the nation will look in the middle of the century.</p>
      <p>Frydenberg was not ordering older Australians back to work in his speech on the economy this week. He was actually pointing out an existing trend, and not necessarily a negative one, that shows more people aged over 65 are choosing to keep working. The participation rate for this group, he said, had increased from 12.3 per cent to 14.6 per cent over the past five years. Two decades ago it was only 6 per cent.</p>
      <p>Yet he was so caught up in the numbers he forgot what this might mean for real people, far from Parliament House, who have to think about getting a new job, a new skill and a new piece of paper to prove their worth to a sceptical employer.</p>

      <p>“With Australians in work currently undertaking 80 per cent of their training before the age of 21, this will have to change if we want to continue to see more Australians stay engaged in work for longer,” Frydenberg said.</p>
      <p>“It is not about forcing people to stay in the workforce, but rather giving them the opportunity and the choice to pursue life-long learning and skills training if they so choose.”</p>
      <p>Frydenberg framed it all as a matter of free will in a free market. “If they so choose.” He was outlining a significant challenge, but this is something to be handled with care. What choice do some people have if they are made redundant in their 50s and cannot claim the age pension until they are 67?</p>
      <p>This can be hard enough for white-collar workers with qualifications and years of experience. Think of what it means for unskilled workers who discover that job offers fall away when they are not quite as fit, as quick or as strong as they were in their 20s.</p>
      <p>Age discrimination is hardly a secret. Almost half the people aged between 45 and 74 who had worked in the previous five years reported a form of “workplace exclusion” on the basis of age. This included being targeted in restructures, or being forced to take redundancies, or being joked about in the workplace, according to an academic study by Timothy Adair and Jeromey Temple eight years ago.</p>
      <p>The government has programs to keep older people in work. The Restart Program offers employers $10,000 if they take on a worker aged over 50 (such as someone registered with Centrelink). The program only offered $1000 before 2013.</p>
      <p>In his speech, Frydenberg spoke of the Pension Work Bonus, which was increased in this year’s budget to $300 a fortnight so people could work more if they wanted without losing the age pension.</p>
      <p>The hard truth is that it will take more than these schemes to create a world with enough opportunities for millions of people, some of whom now rely on Newstart in early retirement until they reach pension age. There is no sign of a major policy package on this front in the mid-year budget update next month.</p>
      <p>The debate is a reminder of a broader weakness of the Morrison government – the fact that it “feels” like a first-term government to some of those who run it. This claim, made by Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack in July, was meant to purvey a sense of energy. Unfortunately, it also suggests that everything old is new again for a Coalition in its third term in power.</p>

      <p>How else to explain the way the government thinks it has discovered this “new” challenge of the ageing population? The problem has been around since at least the Intergenerational Report of 2002.</p>
      <p>Imagine the Whitlam government telling Australians of a new song called <i>Blue Suede Shoes,</i> or <i>Hound Dog</i>. That is a measure of how old this tune about demographic change has become. If only you could tap your toe to it.</p>
      <p>And what has the government done? Faced with this long-term challenge it amended the age pension rules when Scott Morrison was social services minister, but it stepped back from lifting the pension age or scaling back the indexation of the pension. It opposes cuts to big tax concessions that tend to go to older people with shares (franking credits) or property (negative gearing).</p>
      <p>There is no cause for younger Australians to listen to warnings at this late stage about the cost of the ageing population.</p>

      <p>Frydenberg is right to outline the challenge, right to explore the best responses, and right to prepare for the debate about the Intergenerational Report next year. But he is wrong if he thinks voters will be patient while he explains the problem. Six years after the Coalition took power, nobody in this government has the luxury of time.</p>
      <p>The government probably thought it could make headway with the textbook approach to building the case for change: talking about a problem, sparking a debate, drawing out ideas and, only later, putting forward a solution. The trouble is that this no longer works so well with a jaded electorate that has so little trust in its leaders. Voters do not expect their leaders to expound upon questions. They expect them to have answers.</p>
