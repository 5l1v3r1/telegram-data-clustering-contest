      <p>Born in 1888 in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu to a mathematics and physics professor, Raman travelled to Oxford in 1921 to represent India’s Calcutta University, where he had been working as a professor since 1917.</p>
      <p>In fact, poetically, his physics research on the “Raman effect” was inspired by the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
      <p>Upon observing the nature of light in water, Raman began researching how light scatters through particles and molecules which eventually led him to conclude that “when light passes through a transparent material, some of it is deflected to change its wavelength”.</p>
      <p>In 1954, the Indian government honoured the physicist with India's highest civilian award -- the Bharat Ratna. He died on 21 November 1970.</p>
