      <p>The 47-year-old actor and DJ told Fast Company magazine.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I’ve been trying to wean myself off, </i>
        <i>I used to post a lot more, but it’s been putting me off lately. And Twitter’s just not how I want to receive my news. “I read the news aggregated on my iPad, but I can’t check it constantly – I’m not proud of it, but it’s true – because it makes me feel depressed.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Elba also revealed that he has found a way to find peace in his spare time. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I’ll just sit in the dark, stare, and try not to do anything-just clear my mind and decompress.” The star’s dual careers mean that moments of free time are few and far between, however, and he only sleeps “four or five” hours a night, and schedules his time in terms of projects rather than days or hours.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I don’t think in terms of minutes or hours or days or dates, especially because I’m travelling between time zones,” he added. “My home base is London, but I could be working anywhere around the world. I pretty much know my schedule for the whole year, and I think of it in terms of blocks of time, where each project is a block.”</i>
