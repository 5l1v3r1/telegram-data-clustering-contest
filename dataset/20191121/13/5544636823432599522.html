      <p>Lauretta Onochie, President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide on Social Media, has condemned Queen’s College over the viral video of its student with eyelashes, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This news medium understands that a mother of a Queen’s College student had attacked security guards of the school over alleged abuse of her daughter.</p>
      <p>In<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/mother-of-queens-college-student-who-fixed-lashes-attacks-school-security/"> the viral video</a>, the guards refused the student into the school because she fixed artificial eyelashes and was wearing nail polish.</p>
      <p>The yet-to-be-identified woman also locked the shirt of one of the security guards for turning back her daughter and calling her inappropriate names.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/nigerians-react-to-viral-queens-college-eyelashes-video/">reacting to the development</a>, Onochie took to her Twitter handle to describe the handling of the situation as “crude.”</p>
      <p>According to her, the school is meant to nurture and not humiliate or embarrass its students like Queen’s College did.</p>
      <p>“I am a teacher,” she wrote. “I am a Trainer. I am a Lecturer. The crude way a poorly behaved teenager was treated at #QUEENSCOLLEGE, clearly shows that our teachers need training in SKILLS FOR MANAGING POOR BEHAVIOUR.</p>
      <p>The role of the school is to nurture, not to humiliate and embarrass. If school children were perfect, there’ll be no need to send them to school.</p>
      <p>“The role of the School is to facilitate learning which includes character-building &amp; dealing with poor behavioural issues.</p>
      <p>“In dealing with children &amp; teenagers, #QUEENSCOLLEGE need to retrain their staff.”</p>
