        <b>LOTTERY winner Colin Weir has completed a sensational takeover of Partick Thistle.</b>

      <p>Weir, who won £161m on the EuroMillions along with his ex-wife Christine in 2011, bought land at Firhill as part of the deal but will transfer the ownership of this straight back to the club.</p>
      <p>The club have now announced who is on the new board of directors along with Weir.</p>
      <p>The standout inclusion is Dr Charan Gill MBE - otherwise known as Curry King Gill.</p>
      <p>His Ashoka restaurant were one of the club's first shirt sponsors and Mr Gill has maintained close links with the Firhill club.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Ian Dodd, Alan Caldwell, Andrew Byron and John Penman have also been welcomed on the Championship club's board.</p>
      <p>A Jags statement read: "Given the interim nature of the appointments, there will be no Chairman, with chairing of Board meetings done on a rotating basis.</p>
      <p>"As before, Chief Executive Gerry Britton will attend Board meetings with input from manager Ian McCall.</p>
      <p>"There is one final Director; his appointment will be confirmed in due course."</p>
      <p>The 71-year-old <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4759005/euromillions-colin-weir-partick-thistle-bid/">gave his backing to fans group Thistle For Ever</a> over a proposed takeover of the club back in September.</p>
      <p>Now that the takeover has been completed, his Three Black Cats Ltd (TBC) group will hold on to the 55 per cent shareholding before gifting it to a fan entity, modelled on Motherwell's Well Society, no later than March 30 next year.</p>
      <p>And in an extra bonus for the supporters, Weir's group will not require the fans to repay them for the purchase price of the shares.</p>

      <p>TBC will now appoint an interim board comprising of experienced business people and fan representatives, and has asked Thistle For Ever and the PTFC Trust to set up a separate group to create the new entity that will take control of the majority shareholding.</p>
      <p>A statement from the interim board said: "Colin’s generosity means we begin this process in a strong position. The club is debt free and for the first time in over a decade now has full ownership of Firhill.</p>
      <p>"Work will begin immediately on developing plans for community ownership. At its first meeting, the interim Board agreed that the priority at this stage is to ensure the club has stability on and off the park.</p>
      <p>"Although we are in a disappointing position, pushing up the league table towards the play offs has to be the least of our ambitions this season.</p>
      <p>"Ian McCall and the football management team have already achieved some great results in the short time since they were appointed and we are just one game away from a national cup final."</p>
      <p>Weir thanked the supporters who have backed him up until now for trusting him to get the deal over the line.</p>

      <p>He said: "I am grateful to the majority shareholding group and FDL for working with Three Black Cats to pave the way for the exciting prospect of fan ownership for Thistle.</p>
      <p>"I will ensure that the trust they are placing in me is not misplaced. Thistle for Ever planted the thought of fan ownership as a real option in my mind.</p>
      <p>"From there, TBC has taken the dream and is turning it in to a reality. But this has all happened quicker than anyone might have anticipated.</p>
      <p>"That’s why I have offered a three to four month window for fans to get everything in place before handing over shares.</p>
      <p>"They want to get it right and I want to be sure that when the new entity is operational, there is a structure that will allow for a smooth transfer of ownership.</p>
      <p>"This is a major financial commitment on my part as fan owners will not need to repay a penny – but I believe this gives fan ownership the best possible start.</p>
      <p>“There will be a further announcement about the members of the interim Board and, subsequent to that, in relation to my funding of the Thistle Weir Youth Academy.</p>
      <p>“Today is a great day for a club that means everything to me. I hope that fans can get behind this exciting development.</p>
      <p>"They talk about Thistle being their club - and now it really will be."</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the outgoing majority shareholders group, Firhill Developments Ltd (FDL), David Beattie said: "We are pleased that our hard work in recent months has resulted in today’s sale.</p>
      <p>"Our aim has always been to secure the long-term future of the club and we have done this by selling our shares to a man whose support and love for this club is beyond question.</p>
      <p>"Colin Weir undoubtedly has the best interests of Thistle at heart and, although there were alternatives, we believe that his plan to support fan ownership, with the right mix of experienced business people behind them offers the club a secure future.”</p>
