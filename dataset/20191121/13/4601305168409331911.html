      <h1>Utility company asks for proof that a $280 million emerald was lost in California wildfire</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:00:19+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/jstruan" target="_blank">John Struan</a></address>
      <p>It's not <i>impossible</i> for an emerald to be valued at $280 million. In 2017, a 794-pound emerald was found in Brazil <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/08/09/309-million-emerald-weighing-pounds-found-brazil/#5d3f039a5601">and valued </a>at $309 million:</p>

      <p>However, in the ongoing litigation over the 2018 Camp Fire, PG&amp;E has <a href="https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/pge/Home-ClaimDetails?id=MTAzODQ2Nw==">asked</a> for proof that a married couple really lost a $280 million emerald when their home burned down. Their "Beleza Emerald" <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/fires/article237531689.html">was described</a> in court documents as a 500-pound "solid block of black schist and quartz with green crystals."</p>
      <p>Aside from the immense value of the emerald, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/was-a-280-million-emerald-destroyed-in-california-wildfire-pge-is-dubious-2019-11-19">Market Watch</a> notes a few suspicious factors:</p>
      <blockquote>While the Camp fire burned hot enough to melt aluminum — which has a melting point of 1,221 degrees Fahrenheit — emeralds start to degrade at temperatures around 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit<br/><br/>A Google search found no record of a "Beleza Emerald." <br/><br/>According to Realtor.com, the house in question was an 8-bedroom, 4,400-square-foot home in Paradise with an estimated value of $586,000 — raising further doubts that it contained a gem worth more than 477 times the price of the house.</blockquote>
      <p>In an effort to verify the claim, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/fires/article237531689.html">PG&amp;E has requested</a> proof of ownership such as photos of the emerald, or receipts for security precautions such as temperature control or employment of security personnel.</p>
