      <p>
        <b>Newcastle boss Steve Bruce believes his side's season could be defined by this calendar year's remaining fixtures:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"I said coming into this run of games, after the international break, this next five or six weeks is probably the defining part of the season. "The games come thick and fast. I think we've got six or seven games in December, which is ridiculous, so it will define the season and where we're going to be. "The difference in a couple of weeks and a couple of wins and what it does, especially to a club like ours, is remarkable. "The players are bouncing around the place, training is as lively as it's ever been and they're all champing at the bit. "Of course we've picked up one or two knocks but we've got one or two getting back fit so let's hope we can keep the run going."</blockquote>
      <h3>What are the odds?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Aston Villa - 11/10</li>
        <li>Draw - 12/5</li>
        <li>Newcastle United - 5/2</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's our prediction?</h3>
      <p>Two teams struggling at the wrong end of the table. Newcastle, though, are seeing something of an upturn in fortune - winning their last two league games - and the tables may slowly be turning for Steve Bruce.<br/><b>Predicted score:</b> Aston Villa 1 Newcastle United 1.</p>
