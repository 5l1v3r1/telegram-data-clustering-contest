      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:55:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> are keen on Austria Wien striker Christoph Monschein, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old, who has 13 goals in 18 appearances for club and country this season, is Wien’s most saleable asset and his sale could help to alleviate some financial concerns.</p>

      <p>Sport 24 (via <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/aston-villa-sc/">Sport Witness</a> ) have suggested that Villa are interested in the striker, but have been put off by his high asking price.</p>
      <p>The report claims that his club are looking for €5m, for the player described as their ‘super striker’.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Villa have reportedly been scouting Monschein ahead of the January window, with Dean Smith keen to bolster his attacking ranks.</p>
      <p>Austria Wien are currently enduring some financial difficulties and could look to offload the striker, although management believe his sale would cause relegation.</p>
      <p>Smith has hinted that he will look to bring a striker in when the January window opens, with Keinan Davis’ injury leaving only Wesley and Jonathan Kodjia to compete for the centre forward role.</p>
