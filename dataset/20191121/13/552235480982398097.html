      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fan who invaded the pitch with a two-year-old boy to celebrate a goal against Rangers was spared jail.</p>
      <p>Anthony Smith, 32, was over the moon when striker Odsonne Edouard scored a goal in the 2-1 derby win at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-park">Parkhead</a> in March this year.</p>
      <p>Smith ran onto the pitch holding the young boy in his arms, took out his mobile phone to take pictures and waved his arms</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty at Glasgow Sheriff <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> to committing a breach of the peace.</p>
      <p>Smith was ordered to do 225 hours of unpaid work by Sheriff Valerie Mays and banned from UK football matches for three years.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sheriff Mays said: “The nature of your conduct could have caused significant trouble at an Old Firm match and there was lack of concern for the child.</p>
      <p>“The court cannot tolerate that behaviour at football matches.</p>
      <p>“I can deal with this as an alternative to a custodial sentence, just.”</p>
      <p>The court heard Smith leapt over an advertising board with the child in his arms to join fans on the pitch.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Graham Macdonald said: “He waved his arms around and took photos.</p>
      <p>“He took a selfie with himself and the child.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lawyer, Gary Miller, defending told the court that Smith was on the pitch for a minute with "40 to 50 fans".</p>
      <p>He added: “Mr Smith accepts it was a stupid thing to do and attracted negative media at the time.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t the wisest move to take a two-year-old to a derby match. </p>
      <p>“This is something he intends to learn from and is something he will never do in future.”</p>
      <p>Smith, from Glasgow’s Parkhead area, was acquitted of a charge of causing the child unnecessary suffering or injury to health.</p>
