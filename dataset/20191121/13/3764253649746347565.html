      <p>Argentina football legend Diego Maradona <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1258650-diego-maradona-unveiled-manager-argentine-club-club-de-gimnasia.html">has left his position as Gimnasia manager </a>only two months into his new managerial job.</p>
      <p>The World Cup winner had only started to acquire some form with his new club after a horror start which saw him fail to win the first few matches.</p>
      <p>Gimnasia club President Gabriel Pellegrino confirmed the news on local radio station La Red on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that some politics played part in the 59-year old’s decision to walk away.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Maradona was only willing to stay if club President Pelligrino also maintained his position.</p>

      <p>It is understood that Pelligrino withdrew from the club elections and this seems to have been the reason for Maradona's decision to resign as he was not willing to stick around.</p>
