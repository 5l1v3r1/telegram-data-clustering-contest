      <h1>VSCO Redesigned its Feed to ‘Slow Your Scroll’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:34:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>Photo app VSCO has redesigned its feed so that images are bigger. You’ll see single images at a time, instead of the old style where each image was smaller and alternated.</p>
      <blockquote>We believe this redesign will help you explore your VSCO feed in a new way, allowing the subtleties of each image to be front and center as you scroll. At VSCO, creative expression often starts with inspiration and sometimes that requires taking the time to appreciate the details as much as the complete work itself.</blockquote>
      <p>I think it’s an improvement and I’m glad to see it.</p>
