      <h1>PwC’s global operations report 7% revenue growth in FY 2019 </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:59:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/emmanuel-abara/" target="_blank">Emmanuel Abara Benson</a></address>
      <p>Global professional services provider, <b>PricewaterhouseCoopers</b> (PwC) has reported a 7% growth in revenue for the full-year period that ended on June 3oth, 2019. The company specifically earned a total of $42.4 billion from its operations from across six regions namely: the Americas, Western Europe, Central &amp; Eastern Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa, Australasia &amp; Pacific, and Asia.</p>
      <p>Note that during the comparable period in 2018, the company’s global operations realised a total of $40.6 billion.</p>
      <p><b>Majority of the revenue</b> in FY 2019 was made from the Americas ($17.8 billion) and Western Europe ($14.1 billion). Meanwhile, Central and Eastern Europe generated the least amount of money for PwC at $940 million. African and Middle Eastern operations accounted for $1.6 billion out of the total revenue reported for the period under review. Note that PwC Nigeria falls right under here.</p>

      <p><b>Further breakdown</b> of the earnings report shows that the service that generated the most money for PwC in 2019 is “assurance”. Apparently, the company has three major services it provides – Assurance, Advisory, and Tax &amp; Legal. These services fetched the following amounts of money:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assurance: $17.3 billion</li>
        <li>Advisory: $14.3 billion</li>
        <li>Tax &amp; Tax: $10.6 billion</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>While commenting generally</b> on the earnings report, PwC said that companies around the world have continued to demand the services it provides. This explains the reason for the 7% increase in revenue. There was no further breakdown highlighting profit for the period or the cost of operations.</p>
