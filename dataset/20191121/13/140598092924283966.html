      <h1>Sixteen people found in sealed container on ferry bound for the Republic of Ireland </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:21:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/verity-bowman/" target="_blank">Verity Bowman</a></address>
      <p>A lorry has been detained by police after sixteen people were found on a ferry sailing from France to the Republic of Ireland. </p>
      <p>Employees made the discovery during a routine inspection on the Stena Line ferry after it departed from Cherbourg, reportedly after banging was heard on the side of a sealed trailer shortly before 10am on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Stena Line alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare, where the ferry arrived on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The 16 people are reportedly in good health and were moved from the container to a passenger lounge on the ship.</p>
      <p>Two ambulances and several doctors' cars and police cars drove onto the ship's vehicle deck shortly after it docked in south-east Ireland. A large police and Immigration Bureau presence was visible around the port. </p>
      <p>As of yet, the nationality of those involved is unknown. </p>
      <p>According to police, the driver and owners of an articulated lorry were helping them with their inquiries.</p>
      <p>A Garda statement said: "An Garda Siochana are now investigating all the circumstances of this incident.</p>
      <p>"The articulated truck involved in this incident has been detained. The driver and the owners of the articulated vehicle are assisting An Garda Siochana with our inquiries."</p>
      <p>Ian Hampton, Stena Line's chief people and communications officer, confirmed an employee discovered the people during a routine inspection.</p>
      <p>He said: "During the Stena Horizon's 9pm sailing from Cherbourg, France, to Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday November 20, one of our employees during a routine inspection discovered 16 people in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck.</p>
      <p>"All the individuals are reported to be in good health and have been moved to a private passenger lounge on the ship where their wellbeing is the focus of our employees.</p>
      <p>"Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel's arrival in Rosslare."</p>
      <p>Opposition party Fianna Fail's spokesman on justice Jim O'Callaghan expressed his shock and demanded a full investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>"A full investigation must be launched into the discovery of up to 16 people being transported in the back of a lorry to Ireland," he said. "Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery and needs to be tackled with fully resourced policing.</p>
      <p>"Recent events show unfortunately Ireland is playing a significant part in this crime. These traffickers have to be thoroughly policed so vulnerable people are protected."</p>
      <p>The incident comes just days after a group of 25 people were found inside a refrigerated container on board a UK-bound ship just off the coast of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Last month, 39 people were found dead inside a container in Essex which had arrived in the UK via a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
