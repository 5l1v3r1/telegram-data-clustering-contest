      <h2>The vacuum range is one to watch for deals this year as they can be pretty expensive</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:28:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Yates, Stacey Dutton</a></address>
      <p>Popular Shark vacuum cleaners are now heavily reduced for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can now snap up a brand new super-powered vacuum ahead of Christmas in their huge discounts.</p>
      <p>The Shark Clean website is packed with savings to be made on some of their bestselling products- so we assume they will sell like hotcakes.</p>
      <p>Currently the best discount is on the 'NZ801' model which is priced at <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=8065&amp;clickref=Birmingham-SharkClean&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fsharkclean.eu%252Fuk%252Fproduct%252Fshark-duoclean-powered-lift-away-upright-vacuum-cleaner-with-anti-hair-wrap-truepet-model-nz801uktdb%252F%5D%5D">£199.99 instead of £379.99.</a></p>
      <p>Others include cordless vacuums 'IF200' for <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=8065&amp;clickref=Birmingham-SharkClean&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fsharkclean.eu%252Fuk%252Fproduct%252Fshark-cordless-vacuum-cleaner-duoclean-flexology-if200uk%252F%5D%5D">£199.99 instead of £349.99</a> and 'IC160' for <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=8065&amp;clickref=Birmingham-BlackFriday&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fsharkclean.eu%252Fuk%252Fproduct%252Fshark-duoclean-cordless-upright-with-powered-lift-away-ic160uk%252F%5D%5D">£279.99 instead of £499.99.</a></p>
      <p>Plus there's a number of TruePet models included in the sale ideal for pet owners to help remove pet hair from carpets, stairs and sofas.</p>
      <p>This includes 'NZ801' which is priced at <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=8065&amp;clickref=Birmingham-SharkClean&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fsharkclean.eu%252Fuk%252Fproduct%252Fshark-anti-hair-wrap-upright-vacuum-cleaner-true-pet-nz801ukt%252F%5D%5D">£199.99 instead of £349.99</a> in the Black Friday sale.</p>
      <p>When purchasing a vacuum cleaner that's included in the sale you won't need a coupon code as the discounts will automatically be applied.</p>
      <p>The hugely popular retailer has already sold out of a number of products including a £149.99 and a £169.99 item which shoppers have snapped up.</p>
      <p>Shark is also a favourite of the likes of Mrs Hinch who often recommends the products to her millions of followers.</p>
      <p>Previously Amazon has cut the price of a <a href="https://amzn.to/2ppWF4c">Shark vacuum cleaner</a> to £169. The saving of £130 is one of the biggest price drops on the vacuum cleaner this year.</p>
