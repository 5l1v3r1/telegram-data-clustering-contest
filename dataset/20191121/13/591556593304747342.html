      <p>After testing the new Cortana app with Windows 10 insiders, Microsoft has unveiled an updated version "with more productivity" and less fun and entertainment. </p>
      <p>The new Cortana is still in beta and the updated productivity-enhanced version is only available to Windows 10 insiders in the Fast Ring. <br/><br/>But the update offers a further glimpse of how Microsoft is positioning Cortana as a tool to help boost productivity for Microsoft 365 users. For example, it recently <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-embedding-cortana-in-outlook-mobile/">started embedding Cortana in Outlook Mobile</a>. <br/><br/>The company started <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-testing-its-new-cortana-app-as-part-of-its-latest-windows-10-20h1-fast-ring-build/">testing the new app in the Windows 10 Fast Ring in July</a>, offering Bing answers, Assistant conversations, and the ability to open apps, as well as set reminders and timers.<br/><br/>The latest update, while productivity-focused, actually looks more like Microsoft paring back Cortana's capabilities. It has <a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/articles/cortana-windows-beta/">decided to "temporarily" remove some skills</a> that don't relate to productivity, including Bing Instant Answers, jokes and other assistant conversations, and the ability to set timers.     </p>
      <p>The company says these non-productivity skills will soon make a return after it gives them a "fresh coat of paint".  <br/><br/>Rather than a personal assistant like Alexa, Microsoft <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-ceo-nadella-makes-it-official-cortana-is-an-app-not-a-standalone-assistant/">now views Cortana as a provider of skills</a>. To that end, this update delivers improvements to the skills for email, calendar, and Windows. </p>
      <p>Microsoft promises that the updated Cortana app will be a better companion that naturally blends into user workflows. To achieve this goal, it's undocked Cortana from the taskbar, allowing users to move and resize it like other apps. <br/><br/>Users can also go to Settings &gt; Talk to Cortana to choose whether the default input is typing or speaking. <br/><br/>For email, Cortana can help create email and ask Cortana to find emails from a contact. The calendar skill allows users, for example, to ask it to 'Set up a 1:1 with &lt;name&gt; at &lt;time&gt;' or 'What's my next meeting?'. <br/><br/>The Windows skill lets users ask Cortana to open apps and adjust Windows settings. <br/><br/>Microsoft has removed Cortana support for 'connect accounts', which means work and personal accounts have two separate experiences based on the account that's signed in.<br/><br/>Additionally, chat history will be retained locally on the device. Users signing in with a Microsoft account will have their data visible in the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard. </p>
