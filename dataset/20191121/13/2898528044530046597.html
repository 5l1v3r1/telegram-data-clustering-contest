      <h1>Juan Adams, Justin Tafa agree to fight at UFC 247</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">MMA Fighting Newswire</a></address>
      <p>Heavyweights <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4626/juan-adams">Juan Adams</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5113/justin-tafa">Justin Tafa</a> will meet in the Octagon on Feb. 8, sources confirmed to MMA Fighting’s Damon Martin after “The Kraken” Adams announced the match-up on the <a href="https://www.blogtalkradio.com/beyondthecagewithjoel/2019/11/20/ep244-getting-it-kraken-with-juan-adams">“Beyond The Cage”</a> podcast.</p>
      <p>The company has yet to make an official announcement, but the Feb. 8 card is expected to be the UFC 247 pay-per-view and take place in Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>Adams (5-2) is looking to rebound from back-to-back losses to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4094/arjan-bhullar">Arjan Bhullar</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4732/greg-hardy">Greg Hardy</a> in 2019. The heavyweight, who joined the UFC after a quick rise under the LFA banner and a first-round finish at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a>’s Contender Series, hasn’t won a fight since past December, when he finished Chris De La Rocha in his debut at UFC on FOX 31.</p>
      <p>Tafa (3-1) also entered the Octagon for the first time after just three victories in the regional scene, but came up short against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5114/yorgan-de-castro">Yorgan De Castro</a> at last month’s <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1053/ufc-243">UFC 243</a> in his home country Australia. Win or lose, “Bad Man” has yet to go past the second round as a professional mixed martial arts fighter.</p>
