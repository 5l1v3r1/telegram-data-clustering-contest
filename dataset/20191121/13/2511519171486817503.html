It worked, to be fair:<br/> </p>
        <blockquote>José Mourinho followed his appointment at Tottenham Hotspur by sending Harry Kane a text message pledging that the pair will win trophies together.<br/>Mauricio Pochettino was relieved of his duties on Tuesday night and Mourinho, 56, was confirmed as his successor yesterday morning. One of the new head coach’s most urgent tasks is to persuade Kane, who was close to the Argentinian, to commit his long-term future to the club.<br/>It is understood that shortly after agreeing to take the job, Mourinho sent the England captain a message telling him that he considers Kane the best striker in Europe and assuring him that the team will win some silverware.Tottenham have been concerned that Kane, 26, may lose patience with the club’s failure to land a major trophy, even though Pochettino guided them to the Champions League in four successive seasons.</blockquote>

Jose Mourinho is the kind of character everyone loves to hate, who manages to stir up a storyline everywhere he goes.

It's more than 15 years since he arrived on these shores professing to be a special one, yet he still carries a kind of aura everywhere he goes. </p>

        <blockquote>Jose Mourinho believes he has inherited a talented squad that is full of potential as he prepares to be unveiled as Tottenham's new head coach later today.<br/>The 56-year-old has been named as Mauricio Pochettino's successor, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal at the north London club.<br/>He met his new players following his hasty appointment, which was announced less than 12 hours after Pochettino was sacked, on Wednesday and then took training ahead of his first game in charge at West Ham on Saturday.<br/>Despite his intrinsic links to Chelsea, Mourinho has always spoken fondly of Tottenham, touting them as a potential title winner at the start of the season, while he has been in attendance at several games during the current campaign.<br/>The Portuguese boss was always glowing in his praise of Pochettino and has reiterated his delight on Spurs TV at taking on a squad that he believes is full of quality.<br/>"It is a privilege when a manager goes to a club and feels that happiness in relation to the squad that he's going to have," said Mourinho, who will be introduced to the media as the new Tottenham boss at 2pm.<br/>"These are not words of the moment. They are not words of me being the Tottenham head coach. These are words that I've told and I've repeated in the last three, four, five years even as an opponent.<br/>"I always told about the club's potential. I always told about the qualities of the players. I always told about the magnificent work the club was doing. I really like this squad."<br/>Mourinho, who has been out of work since losing his job at Manchester United last December, arrives at a club that is languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, having taken 14 points from their 12 games.<br/>Tottenham are 11 points off the top four and while Mourinho stopped short of saying Spurs could bridge that gap, he promised they would be in a better position once he gets going.<br/>"In relation to the Premier League I think we know where we are and we know that we don't belong there," he said.<br/>"We should just play match after match. The next match we want to win and that is the same for the next and the next and the next until the last.<br/>"At the end of the season we will see where we are but I know that we are going to be in a different position than we are now. I look forward to the challenge and the responsibility to bring happiness to everyone that loves the club."<br/>Mourinho moved quickly to appoint his backroom staff, with Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos joining from Lille as assistant manager and goalkeeping coach, respectively.Tottenham also confirmed the arrival of Carlos Lalin as fitness coach, Ricardo Formosinho as tactical analyst and Giovanni Cerra as technical analyst. All three worked under Mourinho at Old Trafford.</blockquote>
