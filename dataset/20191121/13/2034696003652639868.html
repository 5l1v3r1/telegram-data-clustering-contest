      <p>In a new interview with Vogue, Paris alongside her brother Prince, can be seen changing into a prom-like dress, where she makes the admission.</p>
      <p>Paris says: “This is my second dress, and I feel like a princess,” says Paris. “I never actually went to prom — I skipped it to go see Metallica — so, uh, this feels nice. I would want my prom dress to look like this.”</p>
      <p>Earlier in the video, Paris also reveals that she was an “insane” <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/motley-crue">Mötley Crüe</a> fan growing up and a “heavy metal head.”</p>
      <p>Paris asks her brother: “You just started listening to Mötley Crüe, right?: Before going on: “I know you weren’t a huge fan when I was going through my insane phase…but now you’re really getting into the rock’n’roll bands I like.”</p>

      <p>Back in October, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/michael-jacksons-son-prince-says-can-still-feel-fathers-guidance-2562152">Prince Jackson said he can still feel the “guidance” of his father.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://extratv.com/2019/10/27/prince-jackson-talks-working-with-brother-bigi-and-their-dad-michael-jacksons-guidance/"><i>Extra</i></a> <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/michael-jackson-sons-prince-jackson-bigi-blanket-jackson-youtube-movie-review-channel-taj-jackson-avengers-endgame-2488811#kBepsTKwpZzc6Tr0.99">about a YouTube film review channel he and his brother launched recently,</a> Prince Jackson said that Michael “always” wanted him and his siblings to “chase their dreams”.</p>
      <p>Prince told <i>Extra</i>: “My dad was always a strong believer in going for what you want and ‘go follow your dreams and chase your dreams…</p>
      <p>“So for us to be able to kind of sit there and hopefully make a career about talking about film and looking at film – my brother wants to be a director, I love producing – it’s just, it’s definitely, there’s some form of guidance there that kind of is ushering us into the next generation.”</p>
      <p>Prince, Bigi and Taj launched their show on the channel with a review of <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/avengers-endgame-review"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a>, which was uploaded earlier this year (May 15) and featured James Sutherland as a special guest.</p>
