      <p>Grant Cardone spoke to VladTV about feeling like people who hate on the game of hustling have given up on it, adding that it's like a child losing a game. He went on to speak about gig culture and people denying that autonomy will replace jobs in the future, like Uber and self-driving cars. Cardone also spoke about successful people being obsessed with their mission, which he says is the difference between quitters and successful people.</p>
