        <b>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged the people of the country to be wary of 'disinformation' amid reports of a spike in prices of kitchen staples in the market.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Sometimes, disinformation is spread to create confusion among the people. I would like to urge all of you to ignore those," Hasina said at an event marking the Armed Forces Day on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Onion prices crossed Tk 100 per kg once India stopped exporting the commodity in September before skyrocketing to Tk 250 per kg when Cyclone Bulbul hit the country.</p>
      <p>Prices began dropping again after the government issued warnings against price hikes warned against it while imports began streaming in.</p>
      <p>Amid the crisis in the onion market, rumours of a scarcity of salt started doing the rounds on Monday as traders began raising the price of the product after panicked customer rushed to stores to stock up on it.</p>
      <p>The situation worsened within a day prompting the government to dismiss talk of a shortage of salt in the market as just a rumour.</p>
      <p>Addressing the 'rumours' surrounding the availability of onions and salts, Hasina said, "There's no onion! No salt...these are the rumours that confuse the people. I know that it is easy to become influenced. But we have to prevent it."</p>
