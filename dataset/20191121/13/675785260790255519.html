      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Insurance clerk Helen McCourt, 22, was murdered by pub landlord Ian Simms, now 63, in 1988</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:33:50+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author">Louie Smith, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Parole board judges have freed Helen McCourt's killer from his life sentence.</p>
      <p>Ian Simms, 63, murdered 22-year-old insurance clerk Helen in 1988.</p>
      <p>Her mum Marie McCourt, 76, has spent three decades campaigning for Simms to remain in prison until he revealed the location of her body.</p>
      <p>But following a parole hearing earlier this month he will now be released.</p>
      <p>Marie has successfully campaigned for the introduction of Helen's Law, to make it more difficult for 'No Body' killers to gain freedom.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Parole Board said:  “The Parole Board must make its decisions solely focused on whether a prisoner would represent a significant risk to the public after release.</p>
      <p>"The panel will have carefully looked at a whole range of evidence, including details of the original evidence and any evidence of behaviour change.</p>
      <p>“This is done with great care and public safety is the number one priority.”</p>
