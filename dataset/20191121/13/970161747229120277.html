      <p>A woman may have to register as a sex offender for walking around with her breasts out in front of her step-children at home.</p>
      <p>Tilli Buchanan and her husband took off their shirts to stop them getting dusty while doing garage work in late 2017 or early 2018.</p>
      <p>The children, then aged nine and 13, walked past them at their home in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
      <p>She told a court Tuesday: ‘It was in the privacy of my own home. My husband was right next to me in the same exact manner that I was, and he’s not being prosecuted.’</p>
      <p>Buchanan’s lawyers said ‘she considers herself a feminist and wanted to make a point that everybody should be fine with walking around their house or elsewhere with skin showing.’</p>

      <p>Buchanan was charged with three counts of misdemeanor lewdness in January after a separate child welfare investigation was launched but was not linked to her.</p>

      <p>Buchanan volunteered the information to officials because she was ‘alarmed’ by the proceedings, and was later arrested.</p>
      <p>Her  lawyers are seeking the charges overturned because they are sexist and unfair.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have counter-argued that nudity is commonly understood to include women’s breasts, and that the courts must uphold morality laws.</p>
      <p>Presiding Judge Kara Pettit said the case was ‘too important an issue’ to decide in a hurry, and has said she will issue a ruling in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Buchanan’s case comes amid an ongoing ‘free the nipple’ movement urging women to go topless to challenge similar laws in other US states.</p>
