        <b>Coronation Street star Brooke Vincent has revealed that she ‘sat and cried’ after trying on multiple outfits for a night out.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The actress — who plays Sophie Webster in the ITV soap — <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/coronation-street-star-brooke-vincent-welcomes-baby-boy-kean-bryan-10999328/">gave birth to her first child with partner Kean Bryan last month</a>, and has opened in a new post up about how she ‘felt ashamed’ after she tried on several outfits, and was unable to find anything that she felt ‘looked right’.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, Brooke posted a selfie of herself wearing ‘watermelon PJs &amp; slippers’, and captioned it with: ‘Tonight I was supposed to look completely different, I was supposed to be dressed up, hair and make up done ready to eat some nice food and maybe have my first cocktail in 11 months with Kean, our first time away from Mexx for an hour or two, instead I look like this.’</p>
      <p>‘I look like this because I naively thought that 4 weeks after my baby I would be in all my old clothes looking exactly like I did before I got pregnant.’</p>

      <p>‘I thought my jeans would instantly fit and I would just be my “old self” only with my new beautiful baby. How wrong I was, I tried 23 outfits on at least, nothing looked right, nothing looked like me and I felt like I was looking at a completely different person, I suppose to a certain extent I now am, I am Mexx’s mum.’</p>

      <p>Brooke revealed how she ‘sat and cried and felt ashamed’. However, she was determined to highlight to followers that it’s ‘important to be honest’, while also enforcing that it’s important for mums not to be hard on themselves after giving birth.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘This was so important for me to say, for all the women who think they should look, act or feel a certain way after a baby DONT! Don’t beat yourself up. Do you &amp; if 4/6/8weeks or even a year after giving birth you don’t fit in your old clothes don’t worry, you can always join my club.’</p>
      <p>‘it’s important to be honest because being a new mummy is daunting enough! The most important thing is me &amp; Mexx are healthy &amp; happy and as soon as my baby boy looked at me, I realised he doesn’t care if i fit in my old jeans or not .. So I guess creased watermelon PJs &amp; slippers for now it is’.</p>
      <p>Brooke took to Instagram last month to reveal that she’d given birth, saying: On Wednesday 23rd October at 8.14am Our Baby Boy Arrived. Mexx S J Bryan, you complete us.’</p>

      <p>The actress is currently on maternity leave, and her character <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/27/coronation-street-spoilers-sophie-makes-an-emotional-exit-to-be-with-kate-10731183/">Sophie is off on her travels with ex Kate Connor</a> (Faye Brookes) after girlfriend Paula Martin (Stirling Gallacher) bought tickets for her.</p>
      <p>While it hasn’t yet been revealed if Sophie will return, the character would no doubt be horrified to less than pleased to learn that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/coronation-street-spoilers-tracy-barlow-sleep-paula-martin-major-twist-10980355/">Paula is set to spend the night with Tracy Barlow</a> (Kate Ford) in her absence.</p>
