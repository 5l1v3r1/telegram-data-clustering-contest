      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | With just over a month until the January window opens, rumours linking a number of players with a move to B6 are beginning to surface</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:18:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> are one of three Premier League clubs battling over the signing of free-agent Nicolas Gaitan, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old will be available on a free transfer in January, with his contract expiring at MLS club Chicago Fire in December.</p>
      <p>Gaitan has enjoyed a good spell in the States, netting four times and creating 11 more. A run of form that has reportedly turned heads of suitors in England’s top flight.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/21/nicolas-gaitan-west-ham-aston-villa-free-agent">the Guardian,</a> Villa, West Ham and Sheffield United are all keen on the former Benfica winger.</p>
      <p>Villa signed three wingers in the summer, with Trezeguet, Jota and El Ghazi all arriving. However, a combination of injuries and inconsistent form mean that Dean Smith could be keen to add further reinforcements.</p>

      <p>The report suggests that West Ham’s January priority is to shore up their shaky defence, meaning the door could be left open for Villa to swoop.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith has hinted that Villa could look at signing a forward in the upcoming window and that he is always open to improving the squad.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I'm always open to additions to better the squad. They've got to be better than what you've got. A conversation myself, Christian (Purslow) and (sporting director) Suso have had when we're looking at additions is they've got to be better than what we've already got.</p>
      <p>"We're continuing to do that (improving players), that's the ethos of the club, players wanting to learn and get better. We're working daily to help them improve and I'm seeing improvement individually and the team as a whole.”</p>
