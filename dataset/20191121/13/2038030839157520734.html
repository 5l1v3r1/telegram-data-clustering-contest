      <p>"She's so excited about the partnership, but at the same time, this is her dream to build this beauty empire and just go into many categories that she hasn't even scratched the surface. You know, she launched [Kylie] Skin this year, and she's really excited about that, and that's been a huge success for her, and looks forward to working with Coty to develop more categories and going into other areas of the beauty business, and that's very exciting."</p>
      <p>Kris elaborated, "She feels like this is where she belongs, this is where her passion is since she really wants to use her creative side to develop her brand. And this is what she wants to do for the rest of her life. She talks about it all the time."</p>
      <p>Kris also shared who will probably take over the beauty empire in the distant future.</p>
      <p>"Twenty years from now, she sees herself doing this," Kris added. "And maybe passing it down to her daughter." </p>
