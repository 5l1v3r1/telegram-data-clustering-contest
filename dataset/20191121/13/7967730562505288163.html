      <h1>Tech giants take 'virtually no responsibility' for defamation: Porter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Michaela Whitbourn</a></address>
      <p>Attorney-General Christian Porter has taken fresh aim at social media giants for taking "virtually no responsibility" for defamatory posts by users and foreshadowed reforms to address the "un-level playing field" between traditional publishers and online platforms.</p>
      <p>But legal experts said <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p524q3.html">tech companies could already be sued for defamation</a> if they failed to remove damaging posts, and have called for more detail about potential changes.</p>

      <p>NSW is <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53cf5.html">spearheading a national process to overhaul the country's defamation laws</a>, which were last updated in 2006 after the states and territories passed mirror legislation.</p>
      <p>Mr Porter, who backs NSW's proposals, told the <i>Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i> "one thing likely that will have to be dealt with in a second stage [of reforms] is how you treat online platforms like Twitter and Facebook".</p>
      <p>He took aim on Thursday at online platforms for taking "virtually no responsibility" for defamatory posts.</p>
      <p>Mr Porter said "my own view is that principles of responsibility relating to online platforms should be similar to those applied to traditional publishers and media organisations".</p>
      <p>But he said a "sensible, cautious" approach was required in light of "practical issues", including the "volume of content and comments".</p>
      <p>The NSW Supreme Court ruled this year that media outlets including the <i>Herald</i> had <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p520rf.html">"published" potentially defamatory comments of third parties on their Facebook pages</a>, even though they had not been put on notice of the posts and asked to remove them. An appeal will be heard in December.</p>
      <p>"While respecting the courtâ€™s decision, in my observation that actually makes this un-level playing field worse not better and these are the sorts of issues that legislative reform in this area needs to address," Mr Porter said.</p>
      <p>Sydney-based reputational risk lawyer Rebekah Giles agreed there was an "unequal standard".</p>

      <p>"I applaud Christian Porter's pledge," she said. "I think the time has come now where the distinction between a digital platform and a traditional media organisation should no longer exist."</p>
      <p>Ms Giles said one client had waited years for an online platform to reply to a request to take down defamatory material.</p>
      <p>"If you look at my practice five years ago compared to what it is today the number of complaints about malicious online publications is off the charts," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Giles said she had to "chase" offshore platforms to take down material, at "enormous cost".</p>
      <p>The courts are dealing with a growing number of defamation cases involving plaintiffs suing US-based tech giants. This includes a current Federal Court case brought by Australian plastic surgeon Allan Kalus, who says Google refused to remove a "false and defamatory" review.</p>
      <p>Associate Professor Jason Bosland, deputy director of the Centre for Media and Communications Law at Melbourne Law School, said online platforms were liable for defamatory posts of users where they had been asked to take the material down.</p>
      <p>He said it would impose an "unfair burden or an unfair risk" if any changes were made to impose liability in cases where online platforms did not have notice of defamatory posts.</p>
      <p>Sydney barrister Matthew Lewis, who appears regularly in defamation cases, said it was unlikely Mr Porter intended to expand the liability of online platforms to cases where they were unaware of defamatory posts. He said there "may be some merit" in simplifying the process for removing posts.</p>
