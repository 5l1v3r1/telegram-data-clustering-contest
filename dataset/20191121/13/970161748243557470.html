      <p>A driver who has been convicted of multiple road rage incidents was arrested again for thrusting his hips at a local politician’s daughter, police say.</p>
      <p>Police in Daphne, Alabama said Delwin Knight, 37, made lewd gestures toward a city council member’s daughter in October.</p>
      <p>The girl told authorities she was driving through a neighborhood in Lake Forest when Knight stared at her, grabbed himself and began grinding his hips at her.</p>
      <p>Daphne Police Sergeant Jason Vannoy told <a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/local/serial-road-rager-arrested-again-for-lewd-gesture-toward-daphne-council-members-daughter">NBC</a>: ‘This female victim was driving by a residence in Lake Forest. She made eye contact with Mr. Knight and he made a very lewd gesture in her direction while staring at her.’</p>
      <p>Knight was sentenced to a month in jail earlier this year for three road rage incidents along the Eastern Shore that saw him try to run other drivers off the road.</p>

      <p>He turned himself into police in February after he was charged with ten charges related to road rage incident’s including eight counts of reckless endangerment and two counts of harassment.</p>

      <p>‘It’s just road rage, you know? I didn’t get out and I didn’t harass no one. I probably harassed one person out of the whole eight (victims), Knight told reporter as he surrendered to authorities.</p>
      <p>‘I’m gonna do the right thing. I’m not no bad person. You can look at my record.’</p>
      <p>Five of Knight’s victims appeared in court before his sentencing. One victim said Knight looked directly at them, and even smirked as he harassed them. Another said Knight gestured at him with his middle finger and nearly crashed into him.</p>
      <p>A judge later dropped seven of the charges against Knight. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and two years of probation. The judge told him that if he violated his probation, the additional charges would be fully adjudicated.</p>
      <p>After he was sent to jail, police in Daphne hoped they heard the last from Knight.</p>
      <p>‘We were hopeful that the last round of these types of events from him would stop. Obviously they haven’t, so he’s going to have to deal with the court system now,’ Vannoy said.</p>
      <p>Knight is scheduled to appear in court on January 14, where a judge is expected to revoke his probation, which would mean Knight faces at least two years in prison.</p>
