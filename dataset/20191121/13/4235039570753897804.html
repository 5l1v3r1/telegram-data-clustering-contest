      <p>Director Todd Phillips has said that his movie "The <b>Joker</b>" will be a <b>sequel</b>, according to the Hollywood Reporter.</p>
      <p>The director had a meeting with <b>Warner Bros</b> manager Toby Emmerich. They discussed the possible filming of the second part of the tape.</p>
      <p>Sources tell <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> he proposed an outsized idea — the rights to develop a portfolio of <b>DC</b> characters' origin stories.</p>
      <p>Phillips has sought permission to create new stories with characters in the <b>DC</b> comic universe. According to the newspaper, the director was allowed to shoot another project.</p>
      <p>In the new production, the <b>Joker</b>'s lead role is again expected to be entrusted to Joaquin Phoenix.</p>
      <p>Now, however, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/">Deadline</a> reports that this is false, writing “at this point there are no deals for a <b>sequel</b>, nor even any negotiations”. This is not to say that a <b>sequel</b> will never happen; rather, nothing has been confirmed to date.</p>
      <p>Further information will be provided.</p>
