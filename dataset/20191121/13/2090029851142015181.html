      <p>Staying hopeful, he prayed that the young men taking up leadership positions in the country do their best to influence a positive change rather than the current ones who he claims dedicated their time to ensuring the country lags behind.</p>
      <p>He wrote;</p>
      <blockquote>Naija system is a total joke. Criminals have hijacked naija. Men and women that have dedicated their time 2 make sure that naija will carry last.. No shame. No dignity. No honor. I pray the young men that have entered the system will do their best to influence positive change.</blockquote>
