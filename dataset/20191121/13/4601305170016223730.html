      <p>It's a little corny but William-Sonoma's <a href="https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/star-wars-r2d2-popcorn-maker/">R2-D2 Popcorn Maker </a>will probably appeal to most fans of POP culture, even at its $100 price tag. Something fun: Its head doubles as a serving bowl.</p>
      <blockquote>Give snack time the intergalactic edge with this popcorn maker shaped like everyone's favorite Star Wars™ droid. Simply plug him in, add corn kernels and watch as R2-D2 makes quick work of air-popping a healthy snack for movie night.</blockquote>
      <p>(I'm still nostalgic for the <a href="https://youtu.be/IpXnrk58MQo">Joe Namath "Butter-Up Popper"</a> we had in the seventies!)</p>
