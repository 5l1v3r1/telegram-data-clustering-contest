      <p>The House <a href="https://apnews.com/42c0f380ff514db49f9535b4752c7c32">overwhelmingly approved two measures</a> Wednesday aimed at supporting anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, sending them to President Trump's desk. The Senate had unanimously <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879607/senate-unanimously-passed-bill-support-hong-kong-protesters-china-warning-trump-not-sign">passed both bills</a>, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and another bill to ban the sale of non-lethal munitions to Hong Kong police forces, on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The White House has signaled that Trump will sign the bills, even though they <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/house-passes-hong-kong-rights-bill-amid-trump-china-trade-talks.html">come at an awkward time</a> in ongoing U.S.-China trade talks.

      <p>China again warned the U.S. not to enact the measures, especially the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which threatens Hong Kong's special trade status authorizes sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong authors who carry out human rights abuses. "We urge the U.S. to grasp the situation, stop its wrongdoing before it's too late," and "immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs," foreign ministry spokesman <a href="https://apnews.com/42c0f380ff514db49f9535b4752c7c32">Geng Shuang said Thursday</a>. "If the U.S. continues to make the wrong moves, China will be taking strong countermeasures for sure."</p>
