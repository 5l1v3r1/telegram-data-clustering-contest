      <p>THE Christmas payment will be paid to over 1.2 million social welfare recipients in the first week of December, with payments totalling €279.4 million being made to pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents, long-term unemployed people and many other recipients.</p>
      <p>Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty today said: “Last year, I was particularly pleased to announce the restoration of the additional Christmas payment at a rate of 100%.</p>
      <p>"I am very happy that despite the current climate of uncertainty generated by Brexit, the Christmas payment will again be paid at a rate of 100% this year.</p>
      <p>“This payment recognises the seasonal needs of people who are long-term financially dependent on their social welfare payment for all or most of their income, such as pensioners, people with disabilities and carers.</p>
      <p>“This payment will help those people meet the extra expenses incurred over the Christmas period as well as provide an additional boost for local economies.”</p>
      <p>A breakdown of the some of the payments are contained in the following table:</p>
