          <p>Gareth Bale punctured his already fragile relationship with Real Madrid fans after holding a flag that read: <b>“Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order,”</b> while celebrating Wales qualification to the Euro 2020. What was meant to be banter within teammates, has since become a bone of contention in the Spanish capital among supporters.</p>

                <p>The winger has long been linked to a move away from the club after it became public that Zidane didn’t want him in the side. More so than ever this summer when he shockingly told reporters that it would be best for everyone if Bale left the team.</p>
                <p>It seemed that the French legend would have his way when a Chinese Super league club came calling. However, the deal collapsed in late July leaving both the player and manager with their hands tied. The 3-time Champions League manager has since played the winger 7 times in all competitions this summer.</p>

                      <p>However, it appears that Zidane does not want to add further strain to their relationship after he told Spanish newspaper <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2019/11/20/5dd52a89ca4741df448b45ee.html">Marca</a>, that he won’t take personal action with Bale upon his return from international duty and is more focused with his performances in a Madrid shirt.</p>
