      <p>SOME – BUT NOT all – of the GAA medals stolen from the home of Graham Geraghty have been discovered. </p>
      <p>A number of them were found on a street in Arklow in Wicklow, with the man who found them contacting Geraghty’s wife on social media. </p>
      <p>It’s understood that the burglary of the Meath legend’s home occurred between 9.30pm and 12.30am last Friday evening in Higginstown, Athboy. </p>
      <p>Gardaí confirmed that a burglary in the Higginstown area and that they are investigating. </p>
      <p>In a Facebook post, his wife Amanda said that it took “blood, sweat and tears” to win the medals. </p>
      <p>Calling them a “lifetime of memories”, she asked for the medals to be returned. </p>
      <p>“We will gladly give you what the cash for gold shops will give you for them and more,” she said. </p>
      <p>Speaking to RTÉ’s News At One today, Geraghty explained how some of the medals had been recovered by the man who found them in a bag on a street in Arklow.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to get some of them back,” he said, adding: “I know by the photograph that some of the Leinster ones are still missing.</p>
      <blockquote>The fact we have some of them back is fantastic… I haven’t got my hands on them yet. It might take a while to get [the other ones] back. Fingers crossed.</blockquote>
      <p>Geraghty was the captain when Meath won the All-Ireland in 1999 against Cork, while he also enjoyed All-Ireland championship success with his county at under-21 and minor level. </p>
      <p>The former player, who represented Ireland in the International Rules series, also unsuccessfully contested the <a href="https://www.rte.ie/sport/football/2006/1212/212285-geraghtyg/">2007 general election</a> for Fine Gael. </p>
      <p>Geraghty retired from <a href="https://archive.is/20130904084427/http://www.thescore.ie/end-of-the-road-admits-geraghty-as-meath-plan-without-former-talisman-524070-Jul2012/">inter-county football</a> in 2012. </p>
