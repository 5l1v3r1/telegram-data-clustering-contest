      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>Two teams under-performing, two managers whose futures look uncertain, as Arsenal host Southampton at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are currently in sixth and without a win in four. Southampton are currently second-bottom, have lost their last three league games and have the worst goal difference of anyone.</p>
      <h3>When is it?</h3>
      <p>Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <h3>What time is kick-off?</h3>
      <p>3pm GMT.</p>
      <h3>What TV channel is it on?</h3>
      <p>Because this game is a 3pm kick-off it won't be shown live in the UK. However, you can still follow all the action with us - courtesy of our live blog - if you bookmark this page.</p>
      <h3>What are the current standings?</h3>
      <h3>What is the team news?</h3>
      <p>TBC</p>
      <h3>What are they saying?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Ralph Hasenhuttl hopes going back to basics will help pull Southampton clear of the Premier League relegation zone:</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We have a few players who had a successful time with the national teams, so they come back with a positive experience, so that is good for us.</p>
      <p>"We had an intense week, with a game against Brentford which was a good test for us. We try to get back to our basics, to our fundamentals.</p>
      <p>"It was good for players, I think, that we worked very hard and tried to show them how it can work.</p>
      <p>"I think we had a good atmosphere in the sessions and also in the game. The guys are following (things) well and this is what we need."</p>
      <h3>What are the odds?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Arsenal - 1/2</li>
        <li>Draw - 7/2</li>
        <li>Southampton - 5/1</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's our prediction?</h3>
      <p>Both manager - Arsenal's Unai Emery and Southampton's Ralph Hasenhüttl - are having to field questions about their futures. Hasenhüttl would appear to be safe, for now, but if Arsenal were to lose at home to the Saints the calls for Emery to go are likely to become deafening. Unlikely to happen, though.<br/><b>Predicted score:</b> Arsenal 4 Southampton 0.</p>
