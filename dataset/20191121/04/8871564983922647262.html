      <h1>Thai man charged with murder of his cousin at Missouri restaurant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:17:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>A Thai man was charged Monday with second-degree murder in the killing of his 23-year-old cousin at a Thai restaurant located in the U.S. state of Missouri.</p>
      <p>Porntrep Phonjaroen, 25, is accused of shooting and killing his cousin at the restaurant where he worked Saturday night, according to <a href="https://www.jacksoncountyprosecutor.com/civicalerts.aspx?AID=862">court documents</a>. Upon his arrest, Porntrep reportedly confessed to shooting Vasinee Sankra – a scene captured by the restaurant’s security system – through an interpreter, saying he was upset with his cousin’s work habits.  </p>
      <p>Police called to the Thai Spice restaurant just before 7:30pm found Vasinee on the kitchen floor.</p>
      <p>The restaurant was open at the time of the shooting. One patron said she heard a single gunshot and saw a woman fall to the ground while she was eating near the kitchen entrance, according to the <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article237481449.html"><i>Kansas City Star.</i></a> Though people rushed to try to save Vasinee, she died at the scene.</p>
      <p>The customer then repeatedly asked staff who was responsible, at which point Porntrep reportedly spoke up and said “I did it,” according to the patron’s testimony to police.</p>
      <p>No other injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have set his bond at US$200,000 (THB6 million.)</p>
