      <h1>Home Ministry Cancels TRS MLA's Citizenship Saying It Was For 'Public Good'</h1>
      <h2>An order issued on Wednesday said that TRS MLA Ramesh Chennamaneni misrepresented and concealed facts to attain citizenship of India.</h2>

      <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has cancelled the citizenship of <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/telangana/">Telangana </a>MLA Ramesh Chennamaneni saying the TRS leader misrepresented and concealed facts to attain citizenship of India. </p>
      <p>“His misrepresentation/concealment of fact misled the government of India in making its decision initially. Had he revealed the fact that he had not resided in India for one year before making the application, the competent authority in this ministry would not have granted citizenship to him,” a <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/union-home-ministry-cancels-trs-leader-chennamaneni-rameshs-citizenship-2394413.html"><i>News18</i> report </a>quoted the MHA order as saying. </p>

      <p>In the 13-page order issued on Wednesday the MHA order accused the TRS leader of concealing his travels abroad during the year before his application for citizenship of India. </p>
      <p>An MLA from Telangana’s Vemulawada constituency, Chennamaneni said he would approach the high court to challenge the order. </p>
      <p>The order, according to a <i>PTI</i> report, said that Chennamaneni must be held to higher standards since he held public office and had greater responsibility to be fair in making his submissions. The order said, “His conduct shall stand as an example to the people whom he represents.”</p>
      <p>Quoting a Supreme Court order the MHA said, “Any misrepresentation or concealment of fact at that level would certainly be not conducive to the public good... It is a well-known canon of law that ‘Caesar’s wife should be above suspicion’”</p>
      <p>The PTI report quoted the order as saying the competent authority was “satisfied that it is not conducive to the public good that Dr. Ramesh Chennamaneni continues to be a citizen of India”.</p>
      <p>Exercising its powers, the competent authority decided that Chennamaneni “ceases to be a citizen of India”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/telangana-news/telangana-mla-ramesh-chennamanenis-citizenship-revoked-reports-2135867?pfrom=home-livetv"><i>NDTV</i> quoted</a> Chennamaneni as saying, “But the Home Ministry did not consider that (high court order) and again cancelled (citizenship). So, we will approach High Court again for safeguarding my citizenship.”</p>
