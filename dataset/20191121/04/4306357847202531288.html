      <h2>Mason Greenwood explains why he has always looked up to Man United legend Wayne Rooney</h2>

      <h3>Mason Greenwood has revealed that he always looked up to Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney as a young boy.</h3>
      <p>Greenwood has broken into the first team at Old Trafford at a young age just like Rooney, with the 18-year-old having featured nine times in the Premier League so far this season.</p>
      <p>The teenager will now be hoping to hold down more of a regular spot in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s first team, with the young forward yet to start a Premier League game this term.</p>
      <p>Rooney is Manchester United’s all-time leading goal-scorer and Greenwood has now opened up about how he used to idolise the former Everton striker.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Manchester United’s <a href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/mason-greenwood-reveals-his-footballing-idol-growing-up">website</a>, Greenwood said: “I’ve always looked up to Wayne Rooney.</p>
      <p>“He’s the leading goal-scorer and was always scoring goals and always being the man for the team so I was looking up to him.”</p>
      <p>Asked what was it about Rooney’s game that most impressed him, he added: ”Just his shots really! He would shoot from anywhere, wouldn’t he? He can score from any angle or any distance and he’s been great.”</p>
      <p>Greenwood will be hoping to feature for the Red Devils when they return to Premier League action on Sunday afternoon with a trip to Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are currently in seventh place in the Premier League table as they look to try and break back into the top four this season.</p>
      <p>They finished sixth and without a trophy under Solskjaer last season after he was brought in as Jose Mourinho’s replacement back in December 2018.</p>
