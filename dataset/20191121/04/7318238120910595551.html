      <h3>Does the math behind Elizabeth Warren's 2-cent wealth tax add up?</h3>
      <p>"I have proposed a 2-cent wealth tax," Warren said on Wednesday night. "Your first 50 billion is free and clear — but your 50 billionth and first dollar, you gotta pitch in 2 cents, and when you hit a billion dollars, you gotta pitch in a few pennies more."</p>
      <p>First, Warren misspoke here in the first part of her wealth tax plan. She meant to say "the first $50 million," not $50 billion. We know because it's how Warren's been pitching her wealth tax for weeks — your first 50 million dollars are "free and clear," but once you hit 50 million and one dollar, a wealth tax of 2 cents kicks in.</p>
      <p>It sounds simple, right?</p>
      <p>Well, it's not really. Yes, the tax is 2 cents on the dollar of assets over $50 million and 6 cents of every dollar over $1 billion. (She recently hiked that top bracket from 3 cents on every dollar above a billion to 6 cents, to pay for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/elizabeth-warren-releases-her-plan-finance-medicare-all-n1074981">her health care plan</a>.)</p>
      <p>But, this tax is applied annually, so it would keep wealth from growing in many cases and act like an income tax in many ways. Wealthy investors with assets seeing a 6 percent return annually, for instance, would essentially see a 100 percent tax on those assets.</p>
      <p>It may sound like pennies, but the dollars add up big time: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/business/economy/warren-billionaires-wealth-tax.html">Two economists who advised Warren estimated</a>recently that if her wealth tax had been in effect since 1982, Bill Gates' wealth would be a fraction of what it is now.</p>
      <h3>Did Donald Trump admit to diverting charity money from veterans, as Pete Buttigieg said?</h3>
      <p>"The president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans," Buttigieg said Wednesday night, responding to a question about impeaching President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>This is true. The president did admit to illegally misusing the Trump Foundation — in particular the $2.8 million raised for veterans in an event in Iowa days before the 2016 caucuses — in a court filing. Those dollars were controlled and disbursed by Trump's campaign staff at campaign events, instead of being overseen by the Foundation. The money was eventually donated to charitable causes.</p>
