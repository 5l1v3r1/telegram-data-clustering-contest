        <b>Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress has agreed on a proposal to build a new national secretariat for the party.</p>
      <p>The party has also made a proposal for the establishment of Progressives Institute as promised by the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, during a recent meeting of the NWC with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Aso Rock Villa.</p>
      <p>The proposals are parts of the agenda set by the NWC on Wednesday at its meeting ahead of the National Caucus meeting holding today (Thursday) in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Also at the meeting, the NWC raised a five-member fact-finding committee on crisis rocking the Edo APC.</p>
      <p>The committee is chaired by the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje.</p>
      <p>Members of the committee are the Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari; a former governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi; a former governor of Borno State and serving senator, Kashim Shettima and Ahmed Wadada (Secretary).</p>
      <p>There has been growing tension between the camp of Governor Godwin Obaseki and loyalists of Oshiomhole.</p>
      <p>Recently, Oshiomhole accused the state government of leading thugs to the venue of convocation of Edo University, Iyamho, to embarrass him.</p>
      <p>Fourteen members of the Edo State House of Assembly loyal to Oshiomhole were excluded from the inauguration of the assembly where a speaker against their wish was elected.</p>
      <p>Recall that the APC NWC and the National Assembly had ordered the governor to issue a fresh proclamation with no success.</p>
      <p>According to a statement issued by the APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, after the NWC meeting, the committee is expected to meet with all disputing interests and present its findings to the party.</p>
      <p>“This marks another step in our party’s effort to find a lasting solution to the crisis and ensure our party comes out of it even stronger,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>A member of the NWC, however, told our correspondent that the meeting also agreed on a budget to be presented at the national caucus meeting holding today (Thursday) and further at the National Executive Council meeting of the party holding on Friday.</p>
      <p>The source said, “We also had deliberations on our budget for a new befitting national secretariat and the Progressives Institute. These will be tabled at our national caucus meeting and the NEC meeting.”</p>
      <p>Our correspondent also gathered that disciplinary decisions taken against some high ranking members of the party would be reviewed at the caucus and NEC meetings.</p>
      <p>The Deputy National Chairman (North), Lawal Shuaibu, and the National Vice-Chairman (North-West), Inuwa Abdulkadir, have been placed on suspension by the NWC.</p>
      <p>Two former governors of the party, Rochas Okorocha (Imo) and Ibikunle Amosun (Ogun), and Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), who are members of the caucus, have also been suspended by the NWC.</p>
      <p>But the decisions needed the ratification or otherwise of the NEC.</p>
      <p>For Shuaibu and Abdul-Kadir, the decision of the NEC would have to be approved by the National Convention if their suspension was ratified.</p>
      <p>The source added, “The caucus meeting is expected to be stormy because some are of the view that the party should bury the hatchet and move on while others are saying party discipline should reign.</p>
      <p>“These issues would form part of our discussions because the NWC must table all issues requiring the attention of superior organs of the party.”</p>
      <p>Vacant leadership positions in the party are also expected to be on the front burner.</p>
      <p>The position of the National Secretary has become vacant following the swearing -in of the last occupant, Mai Mala Buni, as Governor of Yobe State.</p>
      <p>Also, the Deputy National Chairman (South), Niyi Adebayo, was recently appointed as the Minister of Industries, Trade and Investment.</p>
      <p>The National Auditor of the party, George Moghalu, has also been appointed as the Managing Director of the National Inland Waterways Authority.</p>
      <p>Another NWC member confirmed to our correspondent that zonal chairmen had been asked to come with names of candidates for the vacant positions in their zones for deliberation at the caucus.</p>
      <p>The APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, could not be reached on his mobile line on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He had also yet to respond to a text message on the agenda of the meeting as of 9.45pm.</p>
