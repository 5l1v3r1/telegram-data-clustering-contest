      <p>The State government has collected ₹1,059.04 crore as cess on sale of liquor between 2014 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The government had allotted ₹8.73 crore for 100 workers who had registered under the Abkari Welfare Fund Board.</p>
      <p>These workers had lost their employment in bar hotels after the changes in liquor policy, the State government submitted before the Kerala High Court.</p>
      <p>Since 2014, 726 bars were closed down, whereas the government gave permission for opening 689 beer and wine parlours. The government informed the court that ₹26.62 crore was spend on the rehabilitation of the alcoholics and awareness programmes. A modern de-addition centre would be opened in Kozhikode, the State submitted.</p>
      <p>It was on a batch of petitions seeking financial aid from the fund that the State submitted the affidavit. The court will consider the case on November 22.</p>
