      <h1>Google Pay expands its supported banks list, still not available in Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:30:48+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Walker</a></address>
      <p>Google Pay’s global footprint just got a lot bigger, but it still doesn’t have so much as a toe in Africa.</p>
      <p>The company’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel">mobile payments platform</a>, which allows users to send and receive money to and from each other, as well as settle split bills, this week welcomed the support of another 62 banks across 17 countries in Europe, Asia and South America.</p>
      <p>The largest swathe of new banks are located in Denmark, with another chunk in Japan and four additions in Finland, as <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/20/google-pay-international-62-new-banks/">noted by Android Police</a>.</p>
      <p>In total, you can use Google Pay in <a href="https://support.google.com/pay/topic/7351519">29 countries worldwide</a>, but not one of these are in Africa.</p>
      <p>That’s not to say contactless, mobile payments services aren’t available on the continent at all.</p>
      <p>Samsung Pay <a href="http://memeburn.com/2018/08/samsung-pay-south-africa/">launched last year in South Africa</a>, while FNB’s support or <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/03/fnb-rmb-samsung-pay/">Garmin and Fitbit Pay</a> also followed suit a few months later.</p>
      <p>Although Google has a clear growth outline for Africa, including providing the continent’s less fortunate <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/11/google-south-africa-free-wifi/">with internet access</a> and <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/10/google-grasshopper-desktop/">coding tools</a>, mobile payments just doesn’t seem to be on its radar. At least for now.</p>
