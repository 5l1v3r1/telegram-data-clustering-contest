      <p><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340062-the-oneplus-7-pro-is-official-and-it-looks-like-it-should-make-samsung-nervous/">High refresh rate displays</a> have been getting more and more popular, but despite almost always leading the pack in display quality, Samsung has been avoiding adopting the feature. Pretty much everyone is anticipating something changing next year, and the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346277-galaxy-note-9-10-ui-one-2-0-beta/">Note 9’s beta software</a> for One UI 2.0 almost confirms that.</p>
      <h3>Samsung finally goes 120hz</h3>
      <p>A new setting in the pre-release software shows a toggle between a 60hz and 120hz display. This would theoretically allow a user to change between the regular 60hz refresh rate of <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340006-samsungs-regular-galaxy-s10-model-might-be-its-least-popular-option-according-to-declining-q1-smartphone-numbers/">their older </a><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340006-samsungs-regular-galaxy-s10-model-might-be-its-least-popular-option-according-to-declining-q1-smartphone-numbers/">flagships</a>, and a much smoother 120hz. Since the Note 9 physically can’t do 120hz, it’s pretty safe to assume that Samsung didn’t mean to leave that toggle in here, and it’s indicating a big feature for the Galaxy S11.</p>

      <p>Aside from the toggle, you’d also have the option to let the phone intelligently switch between the two modes. That’s going to be the most useful way to take advantage of the better hardware without murdering your battery, which the 120hz display is almost guaranteed to do.</p>
      <p>Obviously this is still pre-release software, and Samsung hasn’t announced anything. The Galaxy S11 could end up being stuck at 90hz based on what Samsung is able to pull off, but at least we know they’re working on something. Definitely makes us excited for next April.</p>
