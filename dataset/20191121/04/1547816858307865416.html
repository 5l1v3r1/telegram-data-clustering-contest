        <b>Amitabh Bachchan took to his Twitter handle and shared an edited video but his fans made him realize it is not what he thinks it is</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/amitabh-bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a> usually shares some really amusing and fascinating videos and pictures on his micro-blogging site to share it with his fans and followers. Not just Big B, many Bollywood actors have done this in past. In this process, sometimes they tend to share some fake or inappropriate content that grabs their fans' attention. Well, a similar thing happened with Amitabh when he shared a video in which Mr Bachchan was highly impressed with and it compelled him to share it on his handle. But as usual, he sharing this video drew attention and fans immediately pointed out his mistake.</p>
      <p>The video in question is a fake video where it appears a group of Chinese girls are seen dancing in sync but actually the video edited and it computerized. The video was first shared by a fan of Amitabh who tagged him on the post, saying that these girls were so in sync that they got an entry in Guinness Book of World Record. Her tweet read, ‚Äú‡§ö‡•Ä‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ä 9 ‡§≤‡§°‡§º‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§®‡•á ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§®‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§π‡§ø‡§ï ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ï‡•ã‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§°‡§ø‡§®‡•á‡§ü ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§á‡§®‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§™‡§∏ ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§§‡§æ‡§≤‡§Æ‡•á‡§≤ ‡§á‡§§‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡•á Guinness Book of World Record ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§® ‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§π‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§§‡§ï ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§¨‡§æ‡§≤‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§π‡§∞‡§ï‡§§ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§è‡§ï ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡•É‡§™‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡•å‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡•á @SrBachchan Ji‚Äù Later, Senior Bachchan quoted the tweeted by saying, ‚Äúwow .. even their locks of hair move in sync..‚Äù Watch the video in the question:</p>

      <p>After he shared the tweet, fans started correcting him for his fake video. One found the logic and said, ‚ÄúIt's an edited video. Consider perspectives...Things further away should be smaller than the near ones. Here the furthest girl is tallest. How?‚Äù While one joked about it as she said, ‚ÄúAmit Ji Windows XP ka error hai who.‚Äù There another fan who simply slammed the person who shared this fake video and asked to stop spreading false news, ‚ÄúEditing hai ma'am... It's not sync or talent. It's just a one girl. Tik tok pe aisi videos bhari padhi hai üôÑ Stop spreading false news.‚Äù There was this other set of fans who were concerned if his account was hacked again.
