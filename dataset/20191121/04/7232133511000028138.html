      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After forming a support near the $0.2420 level, ripple started an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/20/ripple-xrp-price-trading-near-crucial-juncture-can-bulls-make-it/">upside correction</a> against the US Dollar. XRP/USD recovered above the $0.2500 resistance area and even climbed above $0.2560.</p>
      <p>However, the price failed to gain strength above the $0.2600 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A high was formed near $0.2585 and the price recently trimmed its recent gains.</p>
      <p>It declined below the $0.2500 level and tested the $0.2480 support. A low was formed near $0.2478 and the price seems to be trading in a range. Moreover, it broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2585 high to $0.2478 low.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the price is facing a lot of hurdles near the $0.2520 and $0.2560 levels. An immediate resistance is near the $0.2520 level. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2585 high to $0.2478 low is near the $0.2532 level.</p>
      <p>The next key resistance is near the $0.2545 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, this week’s major bearish trend line is active with resistance near $0.2575 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the price is likely to struggle near the $0.2545 and $0.2560 levels. The main resistance is still near the $0.2600 area, above which the price is likely to start a strong rise towards $0.2750 or even $0.2820.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.2480 level. If the price fails to stay above $0.2480, it could continue to move down towards the $0.2420 support area.</p>
