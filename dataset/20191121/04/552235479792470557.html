      <h2>Simon Cheng, who worked for the Scottish Development International team in Hong Kong, says he was blindfolded, handcuffed and beaten during his detention.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>An SNP Cabinet secretary has hit out at the torture of a Government worker at the hands of the Chinese authorities.</p>
      <p>Fiona Hyslop said she was “appalled” at the “horrendous treatment” suffered by Simon Cheng, who said he was blindfolded, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-government-worker-blindfolded-tortured-20919719">handcuffed and beaten</a> during his detention in China.</p>
      <p>Cheng disappeared in August and held for 15 days after crossing the Chinese border for a business trip.</p>
      <p>He was believed to be employed as a trade and investment officer at the British Consulate-General and he carried out work for Scottish Development International.</p>
      <p>Cheng met Nicola Sturgeon during her visit to China last April and he posted a picture of himself with the SNP leader.</p>
      <p>In an interview, Cheng said he had been tortured during his detention.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve been shackled, I’ve been handcuffed and I’ve been blindfolded, and also they made me hooded.”</p>

      <p>He claimed he was beaten, forced to sign confessions and accused of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>He added that he was not allowed to sleep and was forced to sing China’s national anthem when he was tired. Before being allowed to speak, he claimed he had to seek permission by saying: “Report, my master.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-official-detained-china-sent-18973384">Cheng</a> said his captors told him they worked for the secret service and informed him there were “no human rights”.</p>
      <p>He added: “They would beat the bony parts, like my ankles... or any vulnerable part.”</p>
      <p>Cheng, who was released on August 24th, also said the Chinese authorities accused Britain of supporting demonstrations in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>He recalled: “They said I’m a state enemy and I’m a traitor, and also they asked whether the consulate instructed me to mingle with the protest.”</p>

      <p>He added: “They wanted to know what role the UK had in the Hong Kong protests - they asked what support, money, and equipment we were giving to the protesters.</p>
      <p>“I told them I want to make it 100% clear, the UK didn’t assign resources or help with the protests.”</p>
      <p>Hyslop, the Cabinet Secretary for External Affairs, said: “I am appalled at the horrendous treatment suffered by Simon during his detention in China – the torture of any individual is utterly abhorrent and must be condemned in the strongest terms.</p>
      <p>“Simon was a valued member of the Scottish Development International team in Hong Kong and his safety has been our upmost concern. As he was employed by the FCO, we have liaised closely with the UK Government during this time and have offered assistance where appropriate.</p>
      <p>“I have spoken to the Foreign Secretary and reiterated this offer of support still stands.”</p>

      <p>Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, summoned the Chinese ambassador after the allegations came out.</p>
      <p>He said the UK Government was “shocked and appalled” by Cheng’s treatment, which he said “amounts to torture”.</p>
      <p>Raab added: “Simon Cheng was a valued member of our team.</p>
      <p>“I summoned the Chinese Ambassador to express our outrage at the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon, in violation of China’s international obligations.</p>
      <p>“I have made clear we expect the Chinese authorities to investigate and hold those responsible to account.”</p>
      <p>Cheng has resigned from his post after two years in the job. He said he agreed with the UK consulate that it would be difficult for him to continue on his role, which requires travel to mainland China.</p>
