      <p>Doctor Fritz von Weizsaecker the son of German former president, Richard von Weizsaecker has been stabbed to death.</p>
      <p>Fritz von Weizsaecker was stabbed to death while giving a lecture at Charlottenburg hospital in Berlin where he worked as a head physician, police announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>According to the Police, a 57-year-old German man jumped up from the audience to attack him and an off-duty police officer who tried to intervene was seriously injured.</p>
      <p>Mr von Weizsacker died from injuries at the scene of the Schlosspark hospital attack.</p>
      <blockquote>The suspect was apprehended by several people and has been arrested, police said.</blockquote>
      <p>“We cannot yet say anything about the attacker’s motive,” said police spokesman Michael Gassen.</p>
      <p>Police said later that the man, who was not a patient at the hospital, had been questioned overnight. Police were also investigating if von Weizsaecker or his family had received threats in the past.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old victim’s father, Richard von Weizsacker, was one of Germany’s most esteemed presidents – a largely ceremonial post – between 1984 to 1994.</p>
      <p>He was one of the ex-president’s four children.</p>
      <p>Dr von Weizsacker studied and worked at several hospitals in Germany and abroad, including the Harvard Medical School in Boston, US, and a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
