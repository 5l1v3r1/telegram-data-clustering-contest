      <p>From the high of the 2019 World Championships gold to the low of several first- or second-round exits, PV Sindhu’s recent journey has been eventful in a strange way. The star shuttler, who scythed through the who’s who of women’s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Badminton">badminton</a> to give the country its first Worlds gold, has been struggling to win matches on the circuit, losing to players she will have for breakfast in her best form.</p>
      <p>To compound the agony, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/saina-nehwal">Saina Nehwal</a>, country’s other top woman player, has suffered the same string of early exits.</p>
      <p>Is it fatigue, poor fitness or simply a slump in form which is responsible for the recent sloppy results? Sindhu looked unbeatable during the World Championships in Basel in August 2019. The way she drubbed the top stars of the game was awe-inspiring. But soon after that, when she was expected to add more trophies to her burgeoning cabinet, she underwent a meltdown which is almost unprecedented in her career.</p>
      <p>Arvind Bhat, former national champion and now a well-known coach, allayed fears, saying, “We can’t start judging a great champion just like this. And with Gopi (chief national coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pullela-Gopichand">Pullela Gopichand</a>) solidly behind her, she will regain her form.”</p>
      <p>Saying that Sindhu might be mentally relaxed a bit after the Worlds gold, Bhat said playing Next Gen players who bring shock value to the court could be one reason for her bad run.</p>
      <p>“It’s pertinent to note that she is mostly losing to young players who bring shock and surprise value to their game. They have new tactics and come up with unorthodox strokes which can often catch you off guard. They play freely and put pressure on you.”</p>
      <p>Gopichand, talking to PTI on Wednesday, attributed Sindhu’s lean run to hectic scheduling.</p>
      <p>“Sindhu has had tough times in the last few matches because of her tough schedule after the World Championships.”</p>

      <p>Gopichand pointed at the hectic travel routine followed by Sindhu, which took her to China and South Korea and then to Denmark and France and then back to China and Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“I think it's been a tough last two months for her," Gopichand was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>The national coach was, however, confident that Sindhu would bounce back strongly, an opinion shared by Bhat.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there is much to worry. I’m sure Sindhu will start playing much better from January next year. And for all we know, she may even win the All England which will give her a great boost for the Olympics.”</p>
      <p>Bhat added that it was good all this was happening well before the Olympics (July-August 2020).</p>
      <p>Did the sudden departure of South Korean coach Kim Ji Hyun, who had played a key role in Sindhu’s Worlds triumph, hamper the shuttler in any way?</p>
      <p>“It might have had some impact. But great players like Sindhu can always rise above these issues. They are not dependent on just one coach to be successful. They know what to do and find a way to win,” Bhat said.</p>
      <p>Saina’s situation, according to Bhat, was a bit more alarming.</p>
      <p>“She is not only losing a lot but her scores are bad too.” Bhat, however, struck a note of optimism.</p>
      <p>“I can’t say she is old or finished. Great players have a knack of coming back. Right now, she should look at being in the top 16 to qualify for the Tokyo Games, which could be her last Olympics.”</p>
