      <p>The boss of a lapdancing club admitted throwing a customer down a flight of stairs – after he refused to buy drinks for two strippers.</p>
      <p>Victim George Williamson had been out celebrating his wedding anniversary with his wife and hadn’t realised The Mask, in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, was a strip club, a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">court</a> heard.</p>
      <p>He went in alone, after his wife returned to their hotel, and was in a booth with the two women when he was attacked.</p>
      <p>The club’s manager Mohammed Iqbal, 29, brought a tray of drinks to the table – and turned violent when George refused to pay.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He swung punches at him four times then threw the man to the ground, placed him in a headlock and elbowed him in the face, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen Sheriff Court</a> heard.</p>
      <p>The victim suffered a fractured left cheekbone and permanent scarring to his right eye.</p>
      <p>Iqbal and a colleague, Chris Masson, then threw the man down a set of stairs and against a bar, before turfing him out on to the road. The club had its licence revoked for four months after the attack.</p>
      <p>It describes itself online as “a hotspot among gentlemen’s clubs offering up-scale discreet adult entertainment until the very late hours in an intimate, sumptuous interior and surrounding that will certainly enlighten your night out”.</p>

      <p>Depute fiscal Lucy Simpson, prosecuting, told the court two women “doing promo” for The Mask stopped the man on the street and persuaded him to go inside. His wife had gone to bed at a hotel but he stayed out in town.</p>
      <p>Ms Simpson said: “The complainer said he thought it was a bar and only realised it was a strip club when Iqbal demanded payment for all three drinks.</p>
      <p>“There was a disagreement about payment and the complainer got to his feet. Iqbal punched him in the face causing him to fall back on to the wall.”</p>
      <p>CCTV footage from the booth shows one of the female staff members removing her top, putting another top on and dancing next to the man before Iqbal walks in and punches him four times.</p>
      <p>Ms Simpson said: “The victim had time off work while he recovered from the attack.”</p>
      <p>Iqbal, of Aberdeen, admitted assault to the victim’s severe injury and permanent disfigurement.</p>
      <p>Masson, also from Aberdeen, admitted assault. The case was adjourned for reports and the pair will be sentenced on December 16.</p>
