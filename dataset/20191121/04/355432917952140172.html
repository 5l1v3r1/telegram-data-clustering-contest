      <h1>Booker hits Biden on anti-legalization stance: 'I thought you might have been high when you said it'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:11:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/cory-booker">Cory Booker</a> (D-N.J.) hit former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> over his recent remarks that he won’t legalize marijuana. </p>
      <p>“I thought you might have been high when you said it,” Booker said during Wednesday’s debate to laughs from the audience.</p>
      <p>“Marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people,” Booker continued, adding that the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown Americans. </p>
      <p>Booker added that this is one of the issues Democrats will need to address in order to win in 2020.</p>

      <p>He also said that no candidate needs a focus group to know that black voters are “pissed off.” </p>
      <p>“I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18,” Booker said about understanding African American voters. </p>
      <p>Biden pushed back, saying that he believes “we should decriminalize” marijuana and adding that anyone with a marijuana-related record should be let out of jail and have their record expunged. </p>
      <p>However, he also doubled down on his position that there needs to be continued research on the “long-term effects” of marijuana use. </p>
      <p>And he defended his record with African American voters. </p>
      <p>“I come out of the black community in terms of support,” Biden said.</p>
      <p>Biden said he would not legalize marijuana during a recent <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/470861-biden-says-he-wont-legalize-marijuana-because-it-may-be-a-gateway-drug">town hall</a> in Las Vegas. He said there is not “enough evidence” as to “whether or not it is a gateway drug.” </p>
