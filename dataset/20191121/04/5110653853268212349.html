      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:55:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:55</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy McArdle</a></address>
      <p>Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas and president Brendan Shanahan finally made their move and fired head coach Mike Babcock after the team's losing streak extended to six games.</p>
      <p>The news disseminated through Twitter quickly — and analysts, reporters and more around the league offered their initial thoughts on the franchise-altering news as it sank in that Babcock would be replaced by the franchise's AHL head coach, Sheldon Keefe.</p>
      <p>Here is a look at how people responded to thenews on Twitter:</p>

      <h3>Mike Commodore, former NHL player</h3>
      <p>Commodore played 11 seasons in the NHL and <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/mike-commodore-rips-mike-babcock-claims-columbus-coach-162609059--nhl.html">developed a high-profile feud with Babcock</a> along the way. He claimed that Babcock "screwed [him] over" while both were working in the Anaheim Ducks organization in 2002 andintentionallymadehim look bad so he could play a preferred player instead. Commodore signed with the Detroit Red Wings before the 2011-12 season, despite reservations about playing for Babcock again, and only played 17 games before being traded away. That season was his last in the NHL.</p>

      <h3>Brandon Prust, former NHL forward</h3>
      <p>Prustplaces the blame for Toronto's struggles squarely on Dubas, who had no prior NHL experience before the Leafs <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/maple-leafs-name-kyle-dubas-32-general-manager-1.4658422">hired him as an assistant general manager</a> in 2014. Hestated that Torontowould be better off with Mark Hunter, who served as anassistantGM alongsideDubas and<a href="https://www.nhl.com/mapleleafs/news/leafs-statement-regarding-mark-hunter/c-298735462">left the organization after Lamoriello's ouster</a> .</p>
