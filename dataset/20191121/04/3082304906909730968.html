      <p>This was confirmed by Philippine Football Federation president and FIFA Council member Mariano Araneta Jr after the AFC Finance and Associations Committee meetings which was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia the other day.</p>
      <p>“Our match officials will create history at the AFC U23 Championship next January when the VAR system makes its full debut. From seven matches at the AFC Asian Cup in UAE, to all 32 matches in Thailand,” he told <i><a href="https://www.the-afc.com/news/afcsection/associations-and-finance-committees-strengthen-commitment-to-develop-afc-mas?fbclid=IwAR1n4ZHBII8A0EdPk-t5CEMd39endNieE28yKYJZ7FMMcBUNuSbpa_tOAUQ">The-AFC.com.</a></i></p>
      <p>The AFC Asian Cup 2019, held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) earlier this year, had seen the VAR used from the quarterfinal stages.</p>
