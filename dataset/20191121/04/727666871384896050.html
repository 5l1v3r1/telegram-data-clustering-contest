      <h1>ASAP Rocky Is Designing Prison Uniforms For Sweden!</h1>

      <p>ASAP Rocky is making the most of his relationship with the country that jailed him.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors)</b> I know this is not new news, but I noticed it wasn't being covered by the site. Who knows why, but I feel it is very worth it! I found it odd that ASAP Rocky even decided to go back to Sweden when it was already a huge deal that he was able to get out of jail scott-free. But then to get a job too? Even crazier! </p>
      <p>He's been hired (I assume) to re-design the prison uniforms so the inmates can look cute or something? I honestly am not sure. Since this story is actually a couple of days old, let me look. </p>
      <p>It is very simple. ASAP volunteered his skills as a fashionisto to getting the jailbirds of Sweden fresh again! <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/OpXvBk/asap-rocky-vill-designa-klader--till-intagna-pa-kronobergshaktet">Aftonbladet</a> is the site that broke from a recent interview with the Harlem legend. “When I was going through my whole situation, the whole time I used to look on television and see Swedish fans showing me so much love and I want to give it back," he said. He also said that he wanted to give clothing to inmates, but it has not happened yet. </p>
      <p>Reminds me of Sheriff Joe Arpaio's punk arse. </p>
      <p>P#nk! </p>
