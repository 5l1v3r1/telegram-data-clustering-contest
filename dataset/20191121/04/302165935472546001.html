      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — Putrajaya is examining the arrest provisions from the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (Sosma) as part of the review of the security law, said Datuk Liew Vui Keong today.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, the minister in the Prime Minister’s Department in charge of legal affairs said he was involved in the review committee that included Home Ministry representatives.</p>
      <p>The committee concluded that such security laws were necessary to Malaysia, he said.</p>
      <p>“Like it or not we still need security law in the country because we have issues with security if we are not careful.</p>
      <p>“We are looking into reviewing the arrest provision — the period which is 24 days at the moment, we are going to review that and to give access for those detained to have legal counsel,” Liew said.</p>
      <p>When asked when the amendment will be tabled in the Dewan Rakyat, he said that the committee needs to engage the various agencies and other stakeholders beforehand.</p>
      <p>The Sosma is among laws in Malaysia that allow the police to detain people without trial.</p>
      <p>Civil liberties lawyer Syahredzan Johan previously said the invocation of the security law invariably results in circumstances that make a fair trial impossible.</p>
