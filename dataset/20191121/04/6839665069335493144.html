      <p>The 25-year-old Briton was selected after he declared an interest in competing in the off-road racing series for electric SUVs, which also includes multiple FIA World Rally title winner Sébastien Ogier and double ERC3 champion Zoltán Bessenyey.</p>
      <p>Extreme E, due to get underway in February 2021, recently added the Nepalese Himalayas to event locations in the Amazon, Greenland and Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>It aims to “break the mould in motorsport and entertainment with its E-SUVs racing across five of the world’s most remote and formidable environments that have already been affected by climate change or human interference. The goal: raising awareness, driving sustainability and inspiring action”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, those included on the Drivers’ Programme will be recommended to teams looking for candidates to fill their Extreme E entries.</p>
      <p>*Subject to confirmation of the results by the FIA</p>
