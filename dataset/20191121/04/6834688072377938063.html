      <p>Nium, previously operating as InstaReM, has enlisted another partner. Today, Nium has announced an agreement with PhillipBank in Cambodia to provide digital cross border payments for enterprises and financial institutions.</p>
      <p>Prajit Nanu, co-founder and CEO of Nium said they are delighted to be working together with PhillipBank to power their outward remittances. He described the relationship as further cementing Nium’s position as a leading provider for cross-border transactions in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>Nium already powers payments for four of the top ten Southeast Asian Banks and leading financial institutions across the globe.</p>
      <p>Ong Teong Hoon, CEO of PhillipBank, commented on the news:</p>
      <blockquote>“This is a significant partnership for PhillipBank at an exciting stage in our evolution. With Cambodian businesses and institutions increasingly engaging with their global counterparts exploring new possibilities for collaboration, we must expand our cross-border payment capabilities into key markets across the world. We are already witnessing increasing demand from our customers for cross-border payments services. We are confident that Nium’s services will complement our offering and further strengthen our capabilities in serving our clients.”</blockquote>
