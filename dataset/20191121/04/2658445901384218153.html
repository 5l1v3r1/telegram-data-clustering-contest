      <p>A former District 9110 Director-General, Dr Mathias Soga, has assured the Rotary Club’s donors that the money they commit to worthy causes will be well-utilised.</p>
      <p>He spoke during a lecture organised by the Rotary Club of Onigbongbo at Ikeja GRA, Lagos.</p>
      <p>The theme was: The obligations and benefits of Rotary Foundation.</p>
      <p>He advised Rotarians to accept the foundation as theirs and to be committed to its ideals, which can be realised through regular donations.</p>

      <p>Soga, who was Director-General between 2010 and 2011, said Rotary Foundation was founded with the objective of “doing good to the world”.</p>
      <p>He described the foundation as the largest in the world and the fifth among the world’s best charities.</p>
      <p>Allaying fears of fund mismanagement, he said: “The fund is efficiently managed by a committee, who devote over 95 per cent of its money to charity.</p>
      <p>“If you have people who are looking for where to put their money, tell them to come to the foundation.</p>
      <p>“Tell them that it has been at the forefront of eradicating diseases.”</p>
