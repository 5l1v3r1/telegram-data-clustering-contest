      <h1>Copper falls as U.S.-China trade deal remains elusive</h1>

      <p>MANILA — Copper prices dropped on</p>
      <p>Thursday, after touching a one-week high in the previous</p>
      <p>session, as a possible delay in a much-awaited “phase one” trade</p>
      <p>deal between Washington and Beijing weighed on sentiment.</p>
      <p>Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was</p>
      <p>down 0.4% at $5,851 a tonne, as of 0331 GMT, while the</p>
      <p>most-active copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange</p>
      <p>slipped 0.2% to 47,050 yuan ($6,685.04) a tonne.</p>
      <p>Completion of a “phase one” U.S.-China trade deal could</p>
      <p>slide into next year, trade experts and people close to the</p>
      <p>White House said, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff</p>
      <p>rollbacks while Washington counters with heightened demands of</p>
      <p>its own.</p>
      <p>Officials from Beijing had earlier suggested that Chinese</p>
      <p>President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump might sign</p>
      <p>a deal by early-December.</p>
      <p>Possibly complicating the trade negotiations further, the</p>
      <p>U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed two bills to</p>
      <p>back protesters in Hong Kong and send a warning to China about</p>
      <p>human rights, which the Senate passed the day before, angering</p>
      <p>Beijing.</p>
      <p>“The Congressional vote on the HK protesters doesn’t help</p>
      <p>get a trade deal done admittedly,” said Robert Carnell, head of</p>
      <p>research, Asia-Pacific, at ING.</p>
      <p>COPPER WEEK: Miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc and China’s</p>
      <p>Jiangxi Copper have agreed treatment and refining</p>
      <p>charges (TC/RC) of $62 a tonne and 6.2 cents per pound for</p>
      <p>copper concentrate supply in 2020.</p>
      <p>COPPER WEEK: The London Metal Exchange is considering</p>
      <p>creating a new market for “green” aluminum, using warehouse</p>
      <p>ownership documents to identify low-carbon material instead of</p>
      <p>spinning off a new futures contract.</p>
      <p>COPPER SUPPLY: The global world refined copper market showed</p>
      <p>a surplus of 29,000 tonnes in August, compared with 71,000</p>
      <p>tonnes deficit in July, the International Copper Study Group</p>
      <p>(ICSG) said in its latest monthly bulletin.</p>
      <p>HUAWEI: The Trump administration on Wednesday gave Huawei</p>
      <p>its second reprieve this week, allowing some suppliers to</p>
      <p>restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant after it was placed</p>
      <p>on a trade black list over national security concerns six months</p>
      <p>ago.</p>
      <p>ING’s Carnell said allowing U.S. companies to do business</p>
      <p>with Huawei, and reports that Trump was looking to exempt Apple</p>
      <p>from tariffs “could be the answer from the U.S. to China’s</p>
      <p>request to roll tariffs back to the situation in May.”</p>
      <p>“But we do not expect China will accept these as a</p>
      <p>replacement for lifting tariffs, as these company level</p>
      <p>exemptions will not be written as a clause in any trade</p>
      <p>agreement,” Carnell said.</p>
      <p>ANTIDUMPING: The U.S. International Trade Commission on</p>
      <p>Wednesday said it had determined that U.S. industry was</p>
      <p>materially injured by below-cost imports of aluminum wire and</p>
      <p>cable from China, locking in U.S. antidumping and countervailing</p>
      <p>duties.</p>
      <p>ALUMINIUM OUTPUT: Global primary aluminum output rose to</p>
      <p>5.392 million tonnes in October from revised 5.222 million</p>
      <p>tonnes in September, data from the International Aluminium</p>
      <p>Institute (IAI) showed.</p>
