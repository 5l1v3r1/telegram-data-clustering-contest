      <p>Fuel prices across southeast Queensland have continued to surge, with the cost of fuel smashing records in parts of Brisbane. SEE WHICH SUBURBS TO AVOID.</p>
      <p>The RACQ is warning motorists that the cost of unleaded fuel is higher than ever in Brisbane’s inner and western suburbs.</p>
      <p>Yesterday’s average unleaded fuel price for that region was a whopping 173.1 cents per litre.</p>
      <p>That figure has smashed the previous record high of 169.4 cents per litre set in October last year.</p>
      <p>The RACQ advised motorists to avoid filling up unless absolutely necessary and to only top up as needed.</p>
      <p>“These high prices in the south east can be attributed to high indicative retail margins, at 29.5cpl, so servos are just raking it in,” RACQ spokeswoman Renee Smith said.</p>
      <p>“When we reach the peak of the fuel cycle we do see pockets of higher prices but we’ve never seen prices this high in central and western suburbs,” Ms Smith said.</p>
