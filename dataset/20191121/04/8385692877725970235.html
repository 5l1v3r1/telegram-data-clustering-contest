      <p>Now's the time to make sure that you have everything you need to cook Thanksgiving dinner. In Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day, they are making that even easier. By discounting a number of kitchen tools for Thanksgiving meal prep, by up 30-percent off. This includes pots and pans, potholders, cutting boards and so much more.</p>
      <p>Best Buy has started its "Beat the Rush" sale, which offers Black Friday prices, ahead of Black Friday. And that includes a great deal on this 65-inch Samsung Q60 QLED TV. It is now just $999, good for $200 off. And this is going to be the same price on Black Friday, so you might as well beat the rush (hence the name of the sale) and pick one up now!</p>
      <p>Best Buy is taking $300 off of the Galaxy S10+, that is if you activate it today. Which you're likely to do anyways, as long as you're not on T-mobile. Best Buy doesn't sell T-Mobile phones. There's really no hoops to jump through, just activate it on your account today, and you can get the Galaxy S10+ for just $699.</p>

      <p>Best Buy has also discounted the HP Chromebook 14 AMD A4-powered model, by $50. This brings it back down to $199, a price we haven't seen for a few weeks. It is also its all-time lowest price. Making it definitely a great time to pick one up. This has a 14-inch full HD display, powered by the AMD A4 processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. And it comes in a very nice dark gray color.</p>
      <p>These deals are all available until midnight PST on the expiration date specified below. These prices are also as up-to-date as possible, but beware that prices will fluctuate throughout the day.
