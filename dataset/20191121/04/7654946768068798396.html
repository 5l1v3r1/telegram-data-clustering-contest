      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/10/dylann-roofs-pen-pal-busted-in-upscale-mass-murder-plot/">Ohio woman who was inspired</a> by an online group known as the “True Crime Community” to plot the bombing of a pipeline and another terrorist attack at a local bar was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Wednesday, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Lecron, 24, was also sentenced to a lifetime of supervision for plotting the attack at a Toledo bar and an interstate pipeline in Georgia in 2018, the FBI said.</p>
      <p>Lecron, along with her boyfriend Vincent Armstrong, became obsessed with mass shootings and other violent acts through the internet fetish group, authorities alleged after her arrest.</p>
      <p>Lecron wrote letters to Dylann Roof and the pair visited areas associated with the Columbine high school massacre, the FBI said.</p>
      <p>They also bought guns and went to the shooting range to practice ahead of their planned attack, which they called “D-Day.”</p>
      <p>“D-day will be my salvation,” Lecron wrote as they were practicing for the shooting.</p>
      <p>In addition to their gun arsenal, Lecron also bought two pounds of black powder and hundreds of screws to use in the pipeline bombing in Georgia.</p>
      <p>“Today’s sentence reflects the severity of her conduct and is a recognition of the continued efforts by law enforcement to protect the public from all violent threats,” US Attorney Justin Herdman said in a statement after the sentencing.</p>
