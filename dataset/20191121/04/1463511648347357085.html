      <p>The Lagos State Police Command has arrested a suspected serial rapist in Egbeda area of the State.</p>
      <p>The suspect, Chuks Emmanuel, described as “most wanted”, is currently facing interrogation at the Area F Police Command, Ikeja for alleged rape and fraud.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel, according to a police source, has been on the police wanted list for a long period of time until last week when a special squad deployed by the Area F Commander, ACP Olasoji Akinbayo, picked him up in a hotel.</p>
      <p>According to the police, female victims had complained bitterly how Emmanuel lured them to hotel rooms where he subjected them to all sorts of blackmails after sleeping with them.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel was alleged to have forced his victims to pay him some money or risk their nude photographs exposed on the internet.</p>
      <p>Luck, however, ran out on Emmanuel as the police used a female to set him up and he fell to the bait.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel, who spoke with our correspondent, said: “I came to Lagos few months ago and things were very rough for me.</p>
      <p>“As I could no longer bear hunger, I thought on how to survive and the thought of getting some females that I would have sex and blackmail them thereafter.</p>
      <p>“I thought of the most vulnerable and I discovered that the best target should be the matured and single ladies.</p>
      <p>“I opened a Facebook account with the name Dr. Chibuzor, MD/CEO Health Wellbeing Therapy.</p>
      <p>“I started sending friend requests to ladies on Facebook.</p>
      <p>“My efforts paid off as single and matured ladies started accepting my friend requests.</p>
      <p>“I would send request to those who I suspected maybe lonely.</p>
      <p>“I started chatting with them.</p>
      <p>“From chatting, the relationship would develop to love affection.</p>
      <p>“When I gain their confidence, I would request to meet with them in any of the three choice hotel that I use.</p>
      <p>“They would honour my invitation.</p>
      <p>“For them to feel that I was a big guy, I would tell them to give me their location where my boy would come and pick them.</p>
      <p>“I would go and pick them, pretending to be an errand boy to the big man who invited them.</p>
      <p>“Already I would have paid for a hotel room.</p>
      <p>“When we arrived the rooms, I would check my victims in and ask them to relax as my master would soon arrive.</p>
      <p>“After about two and half hours, I would come back to the room and inform that my master would no longer be around as an important official assignment took him to outside duty from Lagos.</p>
      <p>“It is at that moment that I would start working on their brains, telling them her how I would assist if they would agree to have sex with me.</p>
      <p>“They usually agree and after sex, I would demand for money from them and they willingly give me.</p>
      <p>“I was not using diabolical means.</p>
      <p>“I think they succumbed out of fear or that they needed sex.</p>
      <p>“There was one that surprised me most as I touched her breast, she started shouting that I should not waste time in doing it.</p>
      <p>“This was a woman that was denied sex for for a long period of time.</p>
      <p>“She is now claiming that I raped her.</p>
      <p>“Many ladies out there are sex starved.</p>
      <p>“I did not rape any of my victims.</p>
      <p>“They willingly gave their bodies to me.</p>
      <p>“They also gave me money for the best reasons known to them.</p>
      <p>“May be, they were afraid that I would expose their nude photographs on the internet, but that never crossed my mind.</p>
      <p>“I have questions for my victims: did any of them raise the alarm when I was raping them and why did they not report to the hotel managements?</p>
      <p>“I was using three hotels.</p>
      <p>“None of the hotels that I was using has ever complained that I raped anyone in their hotel rooms.</p>
      <p>“What has happened has happened.</p>
      <p>“Let us treat the matter the way it is.</p>
      <p>“I did not rape or intimidate anyone.</p>
      <p>“Well, I am not saying that what I did was right because I lured them to the hotels and used their brains so as to have sex with them.</p>
      <p>“I also collected money from them after sex.</p>
      <p>“The last one that put me in trouble was a lady that paid N55,000.</p>
      <p>“She told her friend about how I collected the money after sleeping with her so her friend decided to fight for her.</p>
      <p>“She reported the mater to the police who advised her to send me a friend request and I accepted the request.</p>
      <p>“She booked appointment with me in a hotel.</p>
      <p>“While we were discussing at the pool side, the police picked me.</p>
      <p>“It was at the police station that I was told my offences.</p>
      <p>“I am not happy with the shame I have brought upon myself and my family.</p>
      <p>“My mother has already disowned me.</p>
      <p>“I am very sorry for what I did, but when you look at it critically, you will reason with me that many single ladies are dying and yearning for companion and love making.</p>
      <p>“All the same, I am so sorry, but the police should not accuse me of rape and blackmail.</p>
      <p>“I only used my brain to take advantage of my victims.”</p>
      <p>A manager of one of the hotels that the suspect mentioned that he used to take his victims to, Akpan said: “I know Emmanuel very well.</p>
      <p>“He has brought female friends three times.</p>
      <p>“The thing is that I am still shocked with what I am hearing because none of the female visitors had raised the alarm that she was being raped.</p>
      <p>“The rule in our hotel is that once a lodger has a visitor and he or she is checking out, two of them must leave together.</p>
      <p>“We won’t allow anyone to leave without knowing the condition of the other person.”</p>
      <p>The spokesman of the Lagos State Police Command, DSP Bala Elkana, said the case was being investigated.</p>
