      <h1>'Swimming With Sharks' Adaptation Ordered to Series at Quibi</h1>
      <h2>Kathleen Robertson to write contemporary update of the 1994 comedy starring Kevin Spacey</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:29:34+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/reid-nakamura/" target="_blank">Reid Nakamura</a></address>
      <p>Quibi has given a series order to a series adaptation of the 1994 movie “Swimming With Sharks,” the company announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Kathleen Robertson will write and executive produce the Lionsgate series, which is described as “a contemporary update of George Huang’s original film that both celebrates and skewers the Hollywood studio system. In this adaptation, a young female assistant is at the center of a studio filled with manipulators, schemers and intrigue, but little do they know she is poised to outwit them all.”</p>
      <p>Released in 1994, the original “Swimming With Sharks” film starred Spacey as Buddy Ackerman, an influential movie mogul who turns out to be the boss from hell when he hires Guy (Frank Whaley), a naive young writer, as his assistant.</p>

      <p>Tucker Gates will direct the adaptation, with Chris Cowles serving as producer. Dana Brunetti and Liz Destro also executive producers alongside Jay Cohen and Stephen Israel, who executive produced the original movie.</p>
      <p>“We’re thrilled to partner with our friend Jeffrey Katzenberg and the incredible team at Quibi,” Lionsgate Television chairman Kevin Beggs said. “The series underscores our commitment to partnering with emerging platforms and expanding our valuable library properties like Swimming with Sharks into exciting new forms of storytelling.”</p>

          <figcaption>From "The Twilight Zone" to "Charmed," TheWrap is taking a look at reboots of classic TV shows that should've gotten the boot from the start.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"The Twilight Zone"<br/></b>No reboot of this classic sci-fi series has ever managed to live up to Rod Serling's groundbreaking original series, which ran from 1959 to 1964. The first revival, which debuted in 1984, fell flat of its expectations -- something it has in common with Jordan Peele's 2019 reboot. Though Peele is credited as a creator and serves serves as the host, he did not write or direct any episodes, which critics complained were too on-the-nose, melodramatic, and, well, a lot meaner things than that.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Charmed"<br/></b>Despite the name, this CW reboot was cursed from the start. Side-stepping the original witches -- Alyssa Milano, Shannen Doherty and Holly Marie Combs, and later Rose McGowan -- in favor of newer, younger ones didn't sit well with fans, or with the original ladies themselves. Milano told <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/alyssa-milano-says-charmed-reboot-is-disrespectful/">US Weekly</a> she felt the reboot was "disrespectful" for not including her and her fellow OG cast members. And though it was touted as a "feminist" reboot, <a href="https://twitter.com/H_Combs/status/999007121239826433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E999007121239826433&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvguide.com%2Fnews%2Fholly-marie-combs-charmed-reboot-criticism%2F">Combs tweeted</a>, "I will never understand what is fierce, funny, or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago."</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Magnum P.I."<br/></b>This CBS reboot fell short of its potential for a few reasons -- one being that Tom Selleck was not involved (nor was his mustache). Though set in picturesque Hawaii, critics were quick to tire of the the new Magnum (Jay Hernandez)'s voiceover, calling the reboot average at best, and lacking in panache.</figcaption>

Law." But his 2013 take on the Raymond Burr crime drama was yanked from NBC's air even faster than you can say "LAX" or "The Event."</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Knight Rider" <br/></b>Like so much '80s television, the original "Knight Rider" is over-celebrated. But NBC's 2008 version lacked even the original's dumb charms — and <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/david_hasselhoff/">David Hasselhoff</a>.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"The Returned" <br/></b>SundanceTV had an international hit on its hands with the French-language moody zombie thriller. An English adaptation was of course inevitable, but <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/damon_lindelof/">Damon Lindelof</a>'s A&amp;E remake never quite found its audience, despite gaining the support of critics. Luckily, the original French series is still ongoing.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Melrose Place" <br/></b>The classic nighttime soap got a CW makeover in 2009, but the brand wasn't enough to keep an audience interested, especially on a network that was doing rich young people drama better on shows like "Gossip Girl" and even "90210."</figcaption>

But NBC's 2011 version, starring Maria Bello, struggled to find its voice and lasted just 13 episodes.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Gracepoint" <br/></b>"Broadchurch" captivated U.K. audiences with its tense murder mystery format, but when the U.S. tried to replicate its magic - with original star <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/david_tennant/">David Tennant</a> in tow - it just never quite managed. Needless to say, "Broadchurch" is producing a third season, and "Gracepoint" was canceled after just one.</figcaption>

At least we will always have the pilot, which aired in 2012, which is more than you can say for most pilots that don't get picked up to series.</figcaption>

It's American counterpart -- not so much. The across-the-pond adaptation with <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/joel_mchale/">Joel McHale</a> was ordered to pilot but failed to get picked up at NBC.</figcaption>

Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/ed_oneill/">Ed O'Neill</a> and <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/ethan-embry/">Ethan Embry</a> reboot in 2003 failed to find similar success. It was cancelled after two seasons.</figcaption>

"24: Legacy" had a big debut following the Super Bowl in 2017 but dropped off sharply afterward and was done after just one season. At the time of the cancellation Fox was still considering continuing the "24" franchise.<cite>Fox</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"MacGyver"  <br/></b>Like the hero that shares the show's name, the reboot of "MacGyver," with Lucas Till in the Richard Dean Anderson role, cobbled together a bunch of unusual parts to make yet another procedural that's somehow still kicking, despite constant lampooning from "The Simpsons" and "SNL's" "MacGruber" sketches.<cite>CBS</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"The Odd Couple"  <br/></b>Matthew Perry and Thomas Lennon were no Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, or Tony Randall and Jack Klugman for that matter. The reboot lasted three seasons, but the canned, laugh track sitcom felt very old fashioned and led to some miserable ratings. Matthew Perry even <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/odd-couple-canceled-cbs/">tweeted</a> out one month ahead of schedule that the show was cancelled when he saw his face painted over on his stage door. <cite>CBS</cite></figcaption>
