      <p>GEORGE TOWN, Nov 21 — National Instruments (NI) announced a US$40 million (RM170 million) expansion of its facility in Penang today.</p>
      <p>NI chief executive officer Alex Davern said this would include a second building next to its existing plant.</p>
      <p>“The new expansion will open up 250 new positions,” he said in his speech here.</p>
      <p>NI Penang was established in 2009 as a key global hub and is now the third-largest NI facility in the world.</p>

      <p>The new facility will cover 160,000 sq ft on six acres of land.</p>
      <p>“Altogether, we have 23 acres of land and currently, our production is at 60 per cent capacity in our existing facility,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the new facility will increase the company’s revenue through 5G technology and industry 4.0 products.</p>
      <p>“The technology products built here will be leading edge that includes wireless and 5G technology,” he said.</p>
      <p>The current NI facility has about 1,000 employees and about 70 per cent are in managerial, technical and supervisory roles.</p>
      <p>The total cumulative capital investment in the facility was over US$84 million.</p>
      <p>He said the new facility will be a mixed-use building with a shared service centre and distribution hub.</p>
      <p>Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, in his speech, said the reinvestment was a vote of confidence for Penang and Malaysia’s ability to attract foreign direct investments.</p>
