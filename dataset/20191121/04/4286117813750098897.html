      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Congress, NCP hold meet as govt formation talks continue</li>
        <li>NCP leader suggests avoiding use of word 'secularism' in CMP: Sources</li>
        <li>Congress's Jairam Ramesh, brought in to prepare draft, accepts: Sources</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader pre-empted a possible point of contention between the Congress and the Shiv Sena on Thursday, when he suggested replacing the word "secularism" with more indirect phrasing in a key document.</p>
      <p>The three parties are working to form a government together in Maharashtra, which was placed under President's Rule this month.</p>
      <p>Sources say the Congress was keen on using "secularism" in the prospective alliance's common minimum programme (CMP). But at a meeting of Congress and NCP leaders on Wednesday, one NCP leader suggested a wordier alternative: "...will adhere to Preamble of Indian Constitution".</p>
      <p>The Preamble, of course, says India is a sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic republic.</p>
      <p>Congress leader Jairam Ramesh <b>(far right in the photo above, sitting with a laptop)</b> accepted the suggestion, sources say. He was brought in by his party to help prepare the draft of the CMP.</p>

      <p>Congress leaders left after the meeting. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut was then given a briefing about the draft by NCP leaders. Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray was also informed.</p>
      <p>President's Rule was imposed in Maharashtra this month following a prolonged delay in government formation in the wake of an October state election that the Shiv Sena and the BJP won together.</p>
      <p>The two former allies fell out bitterly, unable to agree that the chief minister's job should be shared using a rotation policy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'DECISION ON MAHA GOVT IN 2 DAYS'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday said a final decision on a new Maharashtra government would be taken in two days.</p>
      <p>He told reporters there were no plans of any meeting between Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and Congress president Sonia Gandhi this week.</p>
      <p>ANI quoted Sanjay Raut as saying the process to form a government would be completed before December 1, and that the three parties concerned would hold a meeting in Mumbai.</p>
