      <p>New Delhi: A day after issuing an order restricting cable operators from showing ‘unauthorised content’ in Kashmir, the I&amp;B ministry has sent an advisory to all the media, including TV channels, to only use ‘the latest political map approved by Survey of India’ in their graphics and news reports.</p>
      <p>“With the creation of two Union territories of J&amp;K and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ladakh">Ladakh</a> on October 31, 2019, the new political map has been released. It has been prepared by the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Survey-of-India">Survey of India</a>, department of science and technology. All TV channels are requested to use only this map,” the I&amp;B ministry order said.</p>
      <p>Representatives of news bodies such as Indian Broadcasters Federation and National Broadcasters Association confirmed to ET that they have received the advisory.</p>
      <p>The new map shows the Union territory of J&amp;K has 22 districts, while Ladakh has two districts. In 2015, the I&amp;B ministry had slapped a showcause notice on Al Jazeera TV channel for showing a ‘wrong map of India’ and had sought its response.</p>
