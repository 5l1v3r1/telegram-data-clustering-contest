      <p>Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, has been named the most powerful celebrity fashion influencer of the year.</p>
      <p>Beating out the likes of Kylie Jenner, the royal topped the top 10 list, based on data including sales, page views, global media coverage and social media mentions used to track 2019’s biggest trends.</p>
      <p>According to global fashion search engine Lyst, Markle’s clothing choices fuelled an average 216% increase in searches for similar outfits.</p>

      <p>Lyst pointed specifically to the Royal Tour of South Africa, where the Duchess wore five different shirt dresses, leading to a 45% spike in searches for the style over the next month.</p>
      <p>It comes after the Duchess guest edited the September issue of British Vogue and released her debut fashion range that would support unemployed women in securing job interviews.</p>
      <p>Timothee Chalamet fell just short in second place, while Euphoria star Zendayatook out third spot.</p>

      <p>Teen pop sensation Billie Eilish took out fourth spot, while Cardi B slipped from fourth place last year to round out the top five.</p>
      <p>Blackpink member Lisa was listed at number six, after becoming K-Pop’s most followed person on Instagram this year, while last year’s top biller Kylie Jenner was relegated to number seven - despite a social media presence of more than 151 million.</p>

      <p>Coming in at number eight is Lizzo, whose breakout year in music has been followed by a skyrocketing influence on fashion, according to Lyst.</p>
      <p>Former One Direction crooner Harry Styles sneaks in at number nine after a memorable appearance at this year’s Met Gala, as Billy Porter rounds out the top 10 following one of the most talked-about fashion moments of 2019 - when the entertainer wore a tuxedo-gown to the Oscars.</p>
