      <p>IF a solid foundation is the key to a successful marriage, this loved-up Perth couple has cemented a strong future.</p>
      <p>Service delivery manager Brad Elsworthy proposed to girlfriend-of-two-years Fran Lyons at the building site of their home in Landsdale, popping the question in yellow spray paint on the newly poured slab.</p>
      <p>“I felt it was right to commit to each other on the slab of our new home, which signals the next chapter in our relationship and is where we will create so many memories,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to know that once the bricks are laid and the carpets go down, beneath it all will be the evidence of my proposal.”</p>

      <p>The everlasting declaration of love was six months in the making with help from Dale Alcock Homes preconstruction team leader Hannah Russell and Miss Lyon’s boss as well as some unwanted interference by the weather gods.</p>
      <p>“As the big day approached, it became apparent that the sunny days were going to be interrupted by a 24-hour storm and the slab pour had to be delayed,” Mr Elsworthy said.</p>
      <p>“I had to contact everyone to rearrange the mysterious plans.”</p>
      <p>The slab went down a few days later, with Miss Lyons’ parents on standby to celebrate.</p>
      <p>“I sprayed the magic words and headed home for Fran’s early arrival and then we made our way excitedly to see the newly poured slab for the first time,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We walked onto the slab and Fran discovered the message, by which time I was on one knee.”</p>
      <p>Miss Lyons, a communications manager, said she initially mistook the message for markings by the construction team.</p>
      <p>“As I walked closer and I realised what it was, it quite literally took my breath away,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I was absolutely surprised and ecstatic to say the least.</p>
      <p>“I felt so special that Brad had gone to all that trouble for me.”</p>
      <p>ABN Group managing director Dale Alcock said it was the first time he had heard of a marriage proposal being built into a new home.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had couples get engaged during key handover, but this is by far the most original proposal of marriage that we’ve had the pleasure of being part of,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We wish Fran and Brad all the very best for the future and many years of happiness in their new home as they embark on this next chapter together.”</p>
      <p>The couple plans to get married in October next year.</p>
