      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — The Malaysian Digital Association (MDA) has announced the re-appointment of Comscore as their measurement partner for audience currency.</p>
      <p>It has also appointed SimilarWeb as their measurement partner for market insight.</p>
      <p>Comscore is a leader in the measurement of digital cross platform data while SimilarWeb provides detailed insights on consumers’ digital footprints to grow a company’s digital market share.</p>
      <p>In a media release, MDA said it hoped to help the industry gain a deeper understanding of its audience and market to uncover new opportunities between vendors.</p>
      <p>Its president Serm Teck Choon said:</p>
      <p>“The MDA realises that it is the right time to not only expand the endorsement beyond audience currency but also to include market insight.”</p>
      <p>MDA’s endorsement of audience analytics began ten years ago as part of its Audit and Research Council.</p>
      <p>Seeing a gap in the market where powerful data was not being utilised, MDA took the leap into the data century.</p>
      <p>MDA Audit and Research Council co-chair Yee Wing-Tak said it was important to have data that as insightful and addressable in the complex world of digital marketing.</p>
      <p>“Every decision has to be measurable and accountable for us to move our digital ambition forward.</p>
      <p>“We are at a stage where we are increasingly hungry for more data measurement sources and for this, we are pleased to have on-board, our measurement partners — Comscore and SimilarWeb.”</p>
      <p>Comscore senior vice president, Asia Pacific Kedar Gavane said the company was thrilled to be reappointed as the digital audience currency for the Malaysian market.</p>
      <p>SimilarWeb Certified Partner general manager SEA Carroll Kee said they were honoured and excited to work alongside the MDA in the endeavour.</p>
