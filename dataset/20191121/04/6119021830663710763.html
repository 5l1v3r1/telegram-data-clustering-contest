      <p>The city's central business district on Wednesday afternoon when DRI officials were conducting a search in a private office on that floor. Bystanders made hay as bundles of currency notes of denominations of Rs 2000, Rs 500 and Rs 100 were seen being pushed out of a window in the sixth floor with the help of a broom.</p>
      <p>DRI sources told PTI that its sleuths had gone to the office of a private company engaged in export-import activities located on that floor to conduct search operations for alleged evasion of duty. "Later reinforcements were also sent," he said adding searches are on.
