      <p>Actor Tanuj Virwani, who is awaiting the launch of the second season of web show <i>Inside Edge 2</i>, has shared that he tried to follow Team India skipper Virat Kohli’s diet to get in shape for his character.</p>
      <p>Virat, who is known to be a vegan recently said that he felt much better in life after turning vegetarian last year.</p>

      <p>“Saw game-changers on Netflix. Being a vegetarian athlete has made me realize what I have believed all these years regarding diet was a myth. What an amazing documentary and yes I’ve never felt better in my life after I turned vegetarian,” Kohli had tweeted.</p>
      <p>And it is this diet of Virat that has inspired Tanuj a lot.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to get into a certain shape for the new season and after doing some research I managed to track down Kohli’s diet plan . Afterall, if you need inspiration to get into shape, you got to seek it from the best. It was really tough in the beginning but slowly and gradually I mentally conditioned myself into believing that if he can do it, so can I. Its all about mind over matter,” Tanuj, said.</p>
      <p>Though Tanuj has not completely turned vegan, he has stopped eating red meat.</p>
      <p>Apart from <i>Inside Edge 2</i>, Tanuj, who is the son of actress Rati Agnihotri, will also be seen in shows like <i>Cartel</i> and <i>Code M.</i></p>
