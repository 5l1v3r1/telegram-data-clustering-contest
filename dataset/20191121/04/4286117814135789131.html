      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pragya Singh Thakur has been nominated to a defence ministry panel</li>
        <li>The defence ministry panel is led by Rajnath Singh</li>
        <li>The Bhopal MP is a terror accused in the Malegaon blasts case</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Controversial Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has been nominated to the Parliamentary Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Defence.</p>
      <p>The 21-member parliamentary consultative committee is headed by Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.</p>
      <p>The Bhopal MP, who is an accused in the Malegaon blasts case, defeated former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The 21-member Parliamentary Consultative Committee also includes the likes of Opposition leaders Farooq Abdullah and Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>Sadhvi Pragya has time and again courted controversy with her remarks. She had landed in a major controversy when she called Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi, a patriot.</p>
      <p>The BJP issued a showcause notice to Sadhvi Pragya over the remark.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Congress party has objected to this development and termed it as "unfortunate".</p>
      <p>PC Sharma, Law Minister in Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh, said that there is a difference in BJP's "words and actions".</p>
      <p>"Modi ji had said that he will take action against her when she made controversial statements. There are many allegations against her. Making her a part of such an important committee is unfortunate," he said</p>
