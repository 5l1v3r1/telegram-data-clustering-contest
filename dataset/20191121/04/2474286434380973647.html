      <h1>Woolworths Moree celebrates 20th birthday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Harris</a></address>
      <p>Britney Spears had just released her debut album, denim on denim was in and a loaf of bread cost 99 cents. The year was 1999 - the same year Woolworths opened in Moree, on November 21.</p>
      <p>Exactly 20 years later, the Moree store celebrated its 20<sup>th</sup> birthday on Thursday, November 21, 2019 with a special morning tea for staff, customers and community partners.</p>
      <p>Moree councillor Mike Montgomery, who officially opened the store in 1999 as mayor at the time, was in attendance, along with current mayor Katrina Humphries.</p>
      <p>They had the honour of cutting the cake, along with two of the three original employees who are still working at the store today - Leisa Soler and Maxine Hobday.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6222111/woolies-kylie-receives-big-thumbs-up-for-going-above-and-beyond/">Assistant manager Kylie Heffernan</a> has also been with the store since the beginning.</p>
      <p>She said there's been some significant changes over the past 20 years, particularly regarding technology.</p>
      <p>"Online is a big thing," she said.</p>
      <p>"That's changed the way we do things."</p>
      <p>When Woolworths first opened in 1999, the <i>Moree Champion</i> ran a feature welcoming the "state-of-the-art supermarket" to Moree.</p>
      <p>"Woolworths have brought the very latest in food shopping to Moree with EFTPOS facilities available at every checkout, providing a more convenient and practical way of doing your grocery shopping in a secure environment," the advertising feature read in the November 18 edition.</p>
      <p>These days there are now not only self-serve checkouts, but card-only machines, and the option to shop online from the comfort of your own home.</p>
      <p>There have also been changes regarding the handling of fresh food.</p>
      <p>"When we first opened we had knobs of meat hanging from the deli; we don't do that now," Ms Heffernan said.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, one thing that hasn't changed too dramatically is the cost of food, much of which has only slightly increased over the past 20 years.</p>
      <p>"Looking through the opening photos of some of the specials, they were nearly equivalent prices to now. The cost of fruit and veg hasn't changed that much."</p>
      <p>In 1999 a loaf of bread cost about 99 cents on special. Today, a loaf can range from about $2 up to $5.</p>
      <p>Ms Heffernan said over the past two and a half years the local store, which was previously the old two-storey bowling club, has made a significant investment in becoming more sustainable, with the <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6097323/moree-woolies-goes-green-with-installation-of-357-solar-panels/">installation of solar panels</a>, LED lights, and more efficient refrigeration and air-conditioning.</p>
      <p>Woolworths Moree is also very committed to supporting the community, and partners with a range of community organisations and local schools to provide fresh food and water.</p>
      <p>"Everything we do is all about our customers and our community. It's what sets us aside from everything else," Ms Heffernan said.</p>
      <p>"I'm very proud to be a part of it. I'm very proud of the team that gets in behind it and helps support it every single time. on behalf of our customers and our team, thank you to you guys for the work you do out there."</p>
      <p>Moree store manager Troy Crocker thanked the community for supporting the store over the past 20 years.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to the customers that come in here every single day to support the local Woolworths," he said.</p>
      <p>"So from me and all the team, thank you. We wouldn't be here today without the customers. We also want to thank the team. Every day you do a great job, so thank you."</p>
      <p>Courtney Palmer did the Welcome to Country, while Laura Tumbers spoke about the store's recent partnership with Moree Aboriginal artist Ann Johnson, from <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/5502042/sisters-join-forces-to-promote-reconciliation-and-female-artists/">Sisters Under the Skin</a>, whose artwork <i>All around us</i> now hangs in the local store.</p>
      <p>Attendees sung 'Happy Birthday' before the two cakes were cut, and guests enjoyed a morning tea.</p>
