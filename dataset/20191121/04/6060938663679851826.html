        <b>Question: I am the founder of a small content company. Over the years, our staff strength has grown to over 60. However, the most tenured employee has been with us just for 2.5 years — and will soon move out for further studies. Every 18 months, I’m rebuilding and restarting with a new team. I am stuck in this never-ending cycle of rehiring and retraining. Freshers use my company to get their first job or some experience before going overseas for studies. Experienced or senior people use us as a means to resume their careers or pivot into this field. I feel employees are very opportunistic. This is frustrating and demoralising. Please advise how we can retain more people.</b>

        <b>Rituparna Chakraborty replies:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Your frustration is relatable and understandable. Incidentally, this is a challenge that is being faced by most organisations — big and small. While the situation is frustrating, let’s try to understand the mind of today’s youngster which can be aligned with the organisation’s objectives. Today’s youths are not driven by the idea of simply landing themselves a job that helps them earn some money. While money is important, it is not sufficient to get them hooked to an idea. What they need are the following:</p>
      <p><b>Purpose:</b> The youths need a strong sense of purpose. As a founder, it is important to share your bigger objective in a compelling and logical manner, connecting all the dots. Their inexperience should never be seen as lack of IQ or EQ. The reason they decide to join startups as against established companies is their desire to be part of a bigger mission. They don’t want to be a cog in the wheel. And if the purpose is stated to have a deeper impact on society than merely generating profits, it resonates well with them.</p>
      <p><b>Learning &amp; innovating:</b> Unlike previous generations, today’s youths put a heavy premium on opportunities to learn and create. They are innately attracted to an organisation that demonstrates a culture of experimenting, failing and learning. They find such organisations refreshing and liberating. They tend to avoid organisations that work in silos and do not encourage employees seeking new avenues. This essentially also means that they do not like being put in slots and being restricted in their job roles.</p>
      <p><b>Communication:</b> One of the reasons youths like joining startups is to be close to the central idea of the organisation. They like the access to founders and want to understand and work with their vision. They seek a higher level of engagement and communication with the core founding team. This is a big draw for them.</p>
      <p>Youths like the idea of being involved and informed on what’s going on in the organization — be it within or outside. They are aware that joining a startup isn’t about making a lot of money in the initial days. However, if they can use their time to be part of something innovative and, at the same time, learn from the prospect of working closely with the think tank, they are up for it. They are willing to stretch themselves beyond imagination.</p>
      <p>Youths propel an organisation, especially startups. Hence, rather than getting antagonised by them, it probably would be advisable to spend some time getting to know their drivers and motivations, which I’m sure you already are.</p>
