      <h1>Key risks for US if Pres. Trump signs Hong Kong bill into law – Global Times</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:28:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>In its latest tweet, the Chinese news outlet Global Times, highlighted the looming risks for the US should President Trump signs the Hong Kong bill into law.</p>
      <p>The tweet read: “Here is what's at risk for the US if @realDonaldTrump signs the HongKong bill making it a law, as HK govt spox pointed out: $33 billion in trade surplus &amp; cooperation from the HK govt in US law enforcement efforts, including its powerful export ban mechanism.”</p>
      <p>Adding to this, most importantly, the US-China likely Phase One trade deal remains at risk if the Hong Kong bill turns into law. Meanwhile, both Hong Kong and the Chinese government has condemned the US’s interference in their internal affairs.</p>
