      <h1>Netflix in December: Here's Everything Coming and Going</h1>
      <h2>We’re gaining “You” Season 2 but we’re losing some seasons of Anthony Bourdain’s “Parts Unknown”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:34:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/margeauxsippell/" target="_blank">Margeaux Sippell</a></address>
      <p>Netflix has released their list of everything coming and going throughout the month of December.</p>
      <p>There’s good news and bad news. The good news is that we’re gaining Season 2 of “You,” which features Penn Badgley as a handsome murderer who seems to kill the women he loves the most. In a surprising twist, we’re also getting the 2005 classic, “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl,” and other highlights like Ian Somerhalder’s new vampire show “V Wars,” “Tiffany Haddish: Black Mitzvah,” and the new Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson-led film “Marriage Story.”</p>
      <p>The bad news is, we’re losing Season 7-11 of Anthony’s Bourdain’s “Parts Unknown.” We’re also losing “Thor: Ragnarok” and “Billy Elliott,” “Rain Man,” “Pulp Fiction,” and “Rocky” I-V.</p>

          <figcaption>Jennifer Lopez — the actress, producer, musician, and all-around pop culture icon — was honored with a cover for <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-icon-of-the-year-2019">GQ's Men of the Year issue in 2019</a>. The "Hustlers" star spoke with Jessica Pressler, the New York magazine writer who wrote the original story that "Hustlers" is based on, about her prolific career.<br/>"There is no reason to ever be ashamed of where you're at. Not when you're doing your best. Not when you're in your best moment," Lopez <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-icon-of-the-year-2019">told Pressler</a>. "There's always gonna be people to tell you no. Or 'You can't.' Or 'You shouldn't.' It's gonna happen. No matter what anybody says, you just have to still be like, 'I'm still doing this. I'm still gonna succeed. I'm still gonna do my best.' Defy the odds. Why not?"<cite>Daniel Jackson / GQ</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>Twenty-three time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams graced <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/serena-williams-champion-of-the-year-2018">GQ's Men of the Year cover in 2018</a>. In her cover story, Williams talked about the double standard when it comes to who is allowed to display anger and who isn't, her relationship with her sister Venus, and taking on the French Tennis Federation's dated standards for how women players must dress on court. "Tennis players in general didn't look like me. Especially the top players or anyone that ever won Grand Slams. Nothing like me. So it was, <i>Can I win looking like this? Can I perform looking like this?" </i>Williams <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/serena-williams-champion-of-the-year-2018">told GQ</a>. "And that was something that I realized that I could do." <cite>Manny Carabel / Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>Actress and activist Shailene Woodley appeared on GQ's Men of the Year cover in 2014. Then 23 years old, Woodley had recently starred in "The Fault in Our Stars" and "Divergent." In her <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/shailene-woodley-men-of-the-year-crush">cover story</a>, she discussed working with co-stars Miles Teller and Ansel Elgort, as well as the "hippie" persona she had been labeled with in Hollywood. "The weirdest adjustment was to sort of absorb the labeling the press loves to do," she said in 2014. "Oh, she’s this person or She’s that person."<br/>"That’s the thing about me in this industry," she added. "I do my thing and then I’m like, 'Peace! See you later! I’m going to Europe, where I’m gonna do my own thing!’ You know? So I don’t really interact."<cite>Jason Merritt / Getty Images for GQ</cite></figcaption>

"I just want it to have the feeling that brings you out of whatever you’re going through. I want it to spark that fire. I want it to be real, authentic, and raw."<cite>Alberto E.

I create art. It’s art, art, art.’ I’m like, Holy shit, are you f--king kidding me? I run around and pretend I’m someone else for twelve hours," she said.<cite>Emma McIntyre / Getty Images</cite></figcaption>
