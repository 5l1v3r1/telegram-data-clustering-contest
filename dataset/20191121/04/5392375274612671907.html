      <p>In response to this statement, MIUI Screening/Vientiane Screen/Dark Mode Manager @MIUICat responded, “Because engineers are in the company for 13 hours a day, there is no time to go out for an interview. So it is difficult to poach”. In addition, @MIUICat  also gave the reason why the custom GIF animation picture loop playback function of the Vientiane screen is not currently active. This is because the function will bring power consumption problems. As of now, it is still in internal evaluation. Most importantly, he added <b>“Looking forward to the global dark mode implementation in MIUI 12”</b>.</p>
      <p>The stable version of <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/miui-11">MIUI 11</a> started rolling out in mid-October. While Xiaomi is preparing this update for more devices, it is also adding some new features. Earlier, there were reports that Xiaomi is preparing Focus mode, Vientiane screen custom image &amp; Class schedule features for MIUI 11. However, these new features are still in the internal testing stage. In addition, the company also adds the new drawer mode to the system desktop. Furthermore, MIUI 11 now has notifications’ sound effect changes with time. It will be interesting to see how the global dark mode will work on MIUI 12. Nevertheless, we will have to wait for a couple of months.</p>
