      <p>The Debt Management Office on Wednesday offered N150 billion from three Instruments. five-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds for N50 billion each to investors at the auction.</p>
      <p>The statement issued by DMO in Abuja indicated that the bond Auction by the DMO, which took place on Wednesday, was highly oversubscribed.</p>
      <p>The DMO explained that the total subscriptions received through competitive bids for the instruments at the Auction was N252.35 billion, indicating a subscription level of 168.23 per cent.</p>
      <p>It said the trend of investors’ appetite for the longer tenored instruments continued with subscription of N115.09 billion or 230.18 per cent for the 30-year Bond.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, the successful bids are allotted at the rate of 12.0000 per cent for the five-year, 12.9300 per cent for the 10-year and 13.3900 per cent for the 30-year Bonds.</p>
      <p>The DMO said: “The allotment rates indicated a significant decline from the rates at which the Bonds were issued at the October 2019 FGN Bond Auction.</p>
      <p>“The total amount allotted for Competitive Bids was N157.93 billion across the three tenors. In addition, the sum of N95.00 billion was allotted through Non-Competitive Bids for all the tenors at the same rates as the Competitive Bids.</p>
