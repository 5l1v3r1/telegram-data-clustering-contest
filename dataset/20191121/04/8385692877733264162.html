      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/oneplus">OnePlus</a> has <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-open-beta-6-for-the-oneplus-7-and-oneplus-7-pro.1143215/">started pushing out</a> a new beta update for the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro. We're talking about OxygenOS Open Beta 6 for the OnePlus 7 series which brings several new fixes to the two devices.</p>
      <p>First and foremost, let's just say that an Android security patch for November is included in this update. OxygenOS Open Beta 6 also brings the notch area display option for the OnePlus 7.</p>
      <p>Many users have been requesting this addition, to be able to hide the notch, and it's now here. We presume that it will be included in the next stable update for the OnePlus 7.</p>

      <h3>OxygenOS Open Beta 6 brings various fixes to the OnePlus 7 series</h3>
      <p>OxygenOS Open Beta 6 fixes the visibility of the fingerprint icon on both OnePlus 7 handsets. This update will also fix the issue with the interruption of the Music app in the ambient display.</p>
      <p>The new beta update also adds the 'Disable' option int he app info section of the Zen Mode. There are quite a few people who don't use Zen Mode at all, and have been requesting this option. OnePlus opted to comply, and include it.</p>
      <p>Those of you who live in India get a special new option as well. Regarding OnePlus Care, the company is now offering you a chance to bind your phone to get rewards, premium experience, and exclusive offers.</p>

      <p>On top of all that, both OnePlus 7 handsets have received various other system stability improvements, and general bug fixes. This is a standard addition with every update, pretty much.</p>
      <p>Do note that this update will be available to your device only if you're already running beta software. If not, you can always easily switch to the beta channel, without losing your data. Do note that you will lose your data the other way around, though, if you switch from beta to stable.</p>
      <p>This update is already rolling out, but it's a staged update. It may take several days for all OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro users to get it. These beta builds are usually rolling out much faster than stable builds, so you should have it soon.</p>

      <h3>OxygenOS 10.0.2 stable update arrived two days ago</h3>
      <p>Both the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro actually received a new stable update not long ago. OxygenOS 10.0.2 <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/oxygenos-10-0-2-brings-tons-of-optimizations-to-the-oneplus-7-series.html">started rolling out</a> to the two devices two days ago.</p>
      <p>That update brought quite a few optimizations to the two devices, and quite a few fixes as well. On top of that, the Android security patch for October was also included.</p>
      <p>The next stable update is expected in the near future, and chances are it will include most of the changes from the beta update we talked about here.</p>
