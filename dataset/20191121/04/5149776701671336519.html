      <h1>Nottingham Forest building bridges as Reds defender dares to dream</h1>
      <h2>Sabri Lamouchi's Reds will return to action this weekend with a game at Bristol City following the international break</h2>

      <h3>TAYLOR-MADE</h3>
      <p>A fresh insight into Nottingham Forest’s stadium plans has got <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/joe-worrall">Joe Worrall</a> dreaming of wearing the Garibaldi in front of a packed City Ground in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Reds last week <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3540790">released new images</a> of their planned stadium redevelopment, with a planning application expected to be submitted before the end of the year and work due to get underway in 2020.</p>
      <p>And as well as the excitement off the pitch, there is plenty to be optimistic about on the field as Sabri Lamouchi’s men look to mount a promotion push this season.</p>
      <p>Boyhood Reds fan Worrall says <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3552378">the City Ground project</a> - with phase one rebuilding the Peter Taylor Stand to cater for 10,000 fans - is the perfect incentive as the team aim to maintain their top six spot.</p>

      <h3>PITCH PERFECT?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s City Ground redevelopment project “is very much a stadium-wide exercise”.</p>
      <p>And that could also include looking at how to improve the drainage from the pitch.</p>
      <p>A planning application is expected to be submitted before the end of the year, with work to transform the club’s home into a world-class venue hoped to get underway in 2020.</p>
      <p>And asked if modifications to the playing surface could be part of the redevelopment plans, Tom Cartledge, lead architect and CEO of Benoy - the architectural firm behind the project - said: “The stadium in its entirety is part of the bigger conversation.</p>

      <h3>NO WAY JOSE</h3>
      <p>Former Nottingham Forest striker Stan Collymore has questioned Tottenham's appointment of Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is the new manager of Tottenham following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss has signed a three-and-a-half year contract with the London club.</p>
      <p>The appointment comes less than 12 hours after Spurs parted company with Pochettino on Tuesday evening.</p>

      <h3>BUILDING BRIDGES</h3>
      <p>Nottingham Forest’s relationship with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts County</a> is one which continues to flourish, according to the Magpies new owners.</p>
      <p>The two city neighbours have rebuilt their relationship following County’s takeover in the summer, and even struck a deal for the Magpies to use their <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/notts-county-complete-move-nottingham-3378382">Trent Pool training facility</a> which the National League outfit hope will be extended beyond the end of the current season.</p>
      <p>“We are really happy with our relationship,” said Christoffer Reedtz.</p>
      <p>“Nicholas Randall has been really welcoming.</p>
      <p>“We are really pleased with the relationship we are building.”</p>
