      <p>According to some <a href="https://winfuture.de/news,112517.html">information</a> provided by WinFuture, <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/huawei">Huawei</a>'s flagship is coming to Europe next month. The Huawei Mate 30 Pro will launch in Europe in December, but without Google apps / services.</p>
      <p>This is not surprising, as Huawei is not allowed to include GSM on its new smartphones. Huawei has been postponing the global release of the Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro for that reason.</p>
      <p>The company was hoping that the US trade ban will be lifted by now, as the first part of the trade deal is near completion… but that didn't happen. Huawei is still not allowed to do business with Google, hence it cannot use its applications / services.</p>

      <h3>Spain will be the first stop for the Huawei Mate 30 Pro in Europe</h3>
      <p>The source says that the Mate 30 Pro will first reach Spain in December, but will be available in limited quantities. The phone will become available on December 9, it seems. Spain will be only the first stop in Europe for the Mate 30 Pro, it seems.</p>
      <p>It is not exactly surprising that Huawei plans on offering the device in limited quantities. Users in Europe, and generally markets outside of China, are used to having Google apps installed.</p>
      <p>Without GMS, Huawei users do not have access to the Play Store, or any of other Google-made apps. That was they cannot access the Play Store's vast collection of Android applications, and that is a huge problem for people, of course.</p>

      <p>Huawei did well biding its time, and truth be said, without a solution for this issue, it may be best for the company not to release the phone at all. The whole situation with the US will hopefully be resolved soon.</p>
      <p>Huawei is an unfortunate victim in the US-China trade war. The two countries simply cannot agree on a trade deal, and the US decided to hand out some bans a while back.</p>
      <p>The US banned Huawei from doing business with US-based companies, even though it did allow some of them to continue doing so. What does that mean for Huawei? Well, the US companies can do business with Huawei up to a degree, the company can update its existing models with new versions of Android, and continue using Google's OS on those phones, but not new ones.</p>

      <h3>Huawei's flagships were originally announced back in September</h3>
      <p>The Huawei Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro were introduced back in September. Under normal circumstances, Huawei would have released both devices in Europe thus far. That goes for all of its global markets, in fact.</p>
      <p>The Huawei Mate 30 Pro is the more powerful of the two Mate 30 flagships. The device is made out of metal and glass, while it includes four cameras on the back.</p>
      <p>The device comes with a large OLED display, which is also curved, and it includes plenty of RAM. Leica's lenses are also included on the device, and the same goes for a large battery.</p>
