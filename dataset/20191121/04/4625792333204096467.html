      <h1>Biden: 'I come out of the black community'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:21:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:21</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>Joe Biden touted his support from the black community during the Democratic presidential primary debate.</p>
      <p>"Iâ€™m part of that Obama coalition. I come out of the black community, in terms of my support," the former vice president said during the Wednesday debate. "If you notice I have more people supporting me in the black community, that have announced for me because they know me. They know who I am."</p>
      <p>The three-time presidential candidate went on to claim he was endorsed by the only black female senator in history, which met <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/debate-uproar-as-biden-stumbles-saying-only-black-woman-elected-to-senate-supports-him">quick protest</a> from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who pointed out that she was also a black female senator.</p>
      <p>Biden, 77, leads the Democratic primary with the RealClearPolitics national <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html">average</a> of polls, putting him at 30.7% support.</p>
