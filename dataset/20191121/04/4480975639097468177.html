      <h1>EUR/USD: Bearish hammer on D1 ahead of ECB minutes</h1>

          <b>EUR/USD created a hammer candle on Wednesday, warning of an impending bearish move. </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Waning trade optimism will likely keep the EUR on the defensive. </b>
        </li>

          <b>The ECB minutes are likely to show growing opposition to the latest stimulus package. </b>

      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a> is looking heavy ahead of the minutes of the European Central Bank's (ECB) October policy meeting, which are expected to show the members stand divided on which course to take.</p>
      <p>The currency pair carved out a bearish hammer candle on Wednesday, indicating the bounce from recent lows below 1.10 has run out of steam and warning of an impending downside move.</p>
      <p>A bearish reversal, however, would be confirmed if the pair closes below the hammer candle's low of 1.1053 on Thursday.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, a close above 1.1081 would invalidate the bearish hammer and signal a resumption of the recovery rally.</p>
      <h3>Waning trade optimism</h3>
      <p>Markets turned risk-averse in Asia, courtesy of reports stating that phase one" U.S.-China trade deal could slip into next year. Traders are also worried that renewed political tensions between the US and China could complicate matters on the trade front.</p>
      <p>Note that China has warned of retaliation to the US Senate's move to pass legislation to safeguard human rights in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The waning trade optimism may not bode well for the common currency. After all, the German economy, Eurozone'smanufacturing powerhouse, took a big hit over the last 12 months, courtesy of the Sino-US trade tensions.</p>
      <p>A bearish close, therefore, looks likely.</p>
      <h3>Focus on ECB minutes</h3>
      <p>The common currency may pick up a bid if the minutes show growing opposition to the massive easing package announced by the former President Draghi in September.</p>
      <p>Any spike, however, is likely to be short-lived, courtesy of trade tensions. Also, the ECB is unlikely to normalize the policy anytime soon, despite the growing rift among the board members.</p>
