      <p>The University at Buffalo football team needed this win. They needed a 49-30 win against Toledo to earn bowl eligibility but more importantly, to prove to that they weren’t going to fold again in a meaningful game.</p>
      <p>The Bulls did it a resounding fashion, as Jaret Patterson scored a school-record five touchdowns Wednesday at UB Stadium.</p>
      <p>Even with six wins, the Bulls still have something to prove. It isn’t just about being bowl-eligible. With the win against the Rockets on Wednesday at UB Stadium, the Bulls must erase any doubts as to whether they belong in a bowl game when they host Bowling Green in their regular-season finale at noon Nov. 29 at UB Stadium.</p>
      <p>That seventh win will be vital.</p>
      <p>“Six wins is not good enough,” said Patterson, who ran for a career-best 192 yards, became the first UB player in the FBS era to score five touchdowns in a game and tied a MAC record for individual touchdowns in a game. “We need seven to solidify our bowl eligibility. We need to keep playing hard and finish out the season strong.”</p>
      <p>One win down and one to go for the Bulls (6-5, 4-3 Mid-American Conference).</p>
      <p>"We’re in the fourth quarter of the season,” UB coach Lance Leipold said. “One of the things we talked about is, ‘Are we going to let 7-plus minutes of football (at Kent State) define our football team?’ Are we going to let that be the tale of what this team is, or are we going to do something about it and go back and play?</p>
      <p>“For three consecutive years it shows our staff and our program is moving towards the consistent goals we put out, the day we arrived. Now, we’ve got to make sure we’ve got a chance to finish that.”</p>
      <p>If the Bulls want to play in a bowl game, however, they need to leave no stone unturned. Bowl bids aren’t handed out like candy.</p>
      <p>“As we found out two years ago, as a head coach, I’d like to get this program to a point where it’s not just bowl eligibility,” Leipold said. “It’s bowl participation and our first bowl victories.”</p>
      <p>The MAC has five bowl tie-ins and could have as many as seven depending on results in other conferences.</p>
      <p>The MAC now has six teams with a minimum of six wins to become bowl-eligible: UB, Miami (Ohio), Western Michigan, Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan and Toledo.</p>
      <p>The emphatic win against the Rockets was the latest chapter in what has been an up-and-down season for the Bulls.</p>
      <p>They showed promise when they led Penn State 10-7 at the half on Sept. 7, a first-half lead that was a product of lengthy grind-it-out drives and third-down conversions before Penn State took over for a 45-13 rout. There was hope that redshirt freshman Matt Myers would seamlessly transition into the starting job. A week later, the secondary got scorched in a 35-17 loss at Liberty, then UB opened up its offense the following week to thrash Temple, 38-22.</p>
      <p>But then the Bulls dropped their first two games in the MAC schedule and lost vital ground in pursuit of a MAC East Division Title. They lost Myers for the season to an upper-body injury. Kyle Vantrease has performed sufficiently at quarterback, throwing for 605 yards and five touchdowns on 67-of-116 passing, with only one interception.</p>
      <p>The Bulls’ biggest unraveling came last week, when they squandered a 21-point lead in the fourth quarter of a 30-27 loss at Kent State and lost their first (and probably best) chance to earn bowl eligibility.</p>
      <p>“We have to go out next week and get that seventh win,” said Vantrease (13 for 20 passing, 172 yards, touchdown pass, rushing TD). “This season, there’s been a lot of things we’ve had to overcome, a lot of adversity. I think it started to show, especially tonight, that we’re coming together as a team. It’s showing the potential of us as a group.”</p>
      <p>How they responded in the wake of that loss at Kent State wasn’t just going to dictate what will happen in the postseason. It’s also going to dictate perception. Right now, the Bulls are resilient and that on Wednesday, they knew how to get the job done. The players who went through collapses in pivotal games (the 2018 MAC championship game, the 2018 Dollar General Bowl and last week at Kent State) weren’t going to make the same mistakes again. They were going to finish.</p>
      <p>Prior to the Toledo game, Patterson plotted what it would take for the Bulls to respond in a meaningful game.</p>
      <p>“It’s about preparation. It’s about training and a solid 60 minutes, playing a whole game as a team,” Patterson said Monday. “You have to play 60 minutes. You can’t play just 30 minutes. This is college football. You see how fast (Kent) came back. You’ve got to play 60 minutes. Not just half a game.”</p>
      <p>The Bulls did that Wednesday. Now, they’ll need to show more – and show that they belong in a bowl game – next week against Bowling Green.</p>
