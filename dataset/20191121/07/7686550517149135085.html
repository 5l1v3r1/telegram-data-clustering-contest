      <p>If you are planning to come into Cardiff by train to start your Christmas shopping this weekend, you had better check before you travel.</p>
      <p>There are going to be cancellations and disruption on several train lines as "essential" work is being carried out in the city.</p>
      <p>The city's Queen Street station is going to be closed and other lines affected as essential upgrade work is being carried out on Saturday and Sunday (November 23 and 24).</p>
      <p>Services will be amended as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There will be no City Line/Coryton/Cardiff Bay services, alternative road transport will be available (Saturday only for City and Coryton lines)</li>
        <li>Rhymney Line services will terminate at Heath High Level station. Bus services will run between Caerphilly and Cardiff Central.</li>
        <li>There will be reduced frequency on the Merthyr/Aberdare and Treherbert services and they will divert around the City Line (running direct between Cardiff Central and Radyr)</li>
        <li>There will be no train services to and from Llandaff and Cathays. Bus services will run between Radyr and Cardiff Central calling at Llandaf and Cathays and Cardiff Queen Street.</li>
        <li>Penarth, Barry Island and Vale of Glamorgan services will also not call at Cardiff Queen Street, Cathays and Llandaf.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The work comes after Transport for Wales announced that the number of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/wales-trains-transport-wales-sunday-17283805">trains running in Wales on a Sunday is going to increase.</a></p>
      <p>They say the changes which will see a 40% increase in services across the country.</p>
      <p>They have also announced increased capacity trains for weekday services in December, which will include more four-carriage trains on Valley Lines and more modern trains on routes between Maesteg and Cheltenham, Cardiff and Ebbw Vale, and North Wales and Manchester.</p>
