      <p>Scott Fraser of the Grampian Highland Games Association revealed just one team from outside the north-east consistently goes to the ten official tournaments each year.</p>
      <p>He said: “Tug o’ war is amazing to play and watch but it is a struggle to get enough teams to travel to the tournaments.</p>
      <p>“Highland Games do a huge amount to bring tourism and money to local economies and I don’t think that’s reflected by the Government.</p>
      <p>“More funding would certainly help.”</p>
      <p>Tug o’ war, an Olympic event between 1900 and 1920, involves two teams of eight trying to pull each other over a line.</p>
      <p>GHGA organisers will meet Scottish Highland Games Association bosses on Sunday to plot how to drag the sport back to its former glory.</p>
      <p>Aberdeenshire Tory MSP Alexander Burnett said: “The value of Highland Games in strengthening links with the Scottish diaspora is incalculable.”</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government said it has invested £140,000 in Highland Games and gave £2,500 in 2018/19 to the Scottish Tug of War Association.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “We are providing funding and support to ensure the Games thrive.”</p>
