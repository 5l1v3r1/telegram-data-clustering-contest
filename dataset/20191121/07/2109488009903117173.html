      <h1>US makes headway on Huawei trade licences</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:45:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#dianagoovaerts" target="_blank">Diana Goovaerts</a></address>
      <p>The US Department of Commerce (DoC) gave the green light for a select number of domestic companies to resume sales to Huawei, as the agency began processing applications from suppliers hoping to skirt a <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/huawei-lands-on-us-trade-blacklist/">trade ban</a> levied on the Chinese vendor in May, <i>Reuters </i>reported.</p>
      <p>Sources told the news agency the DoC thus far reviewed around half of nearly 300 applications it received for special trade licences. Approximately 75 were granted approval.</p>
      <p>The DoC said in a statement to <i>Reuters</i> the licences cover “limited and specific activities which do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests”. However, it did not disclose which companies or components won approval.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i>Bloomberg</i> earlier this month, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said the government was surprised by the large number of requests it received from suppliers looking to continue sales to Huawei.</p>
      <p>Though Huawei landed on a US trade blacklist in May, the vendor has been able to keep working with US partners on a limited basis under a special temporary licence. Earlier this week, the DoC <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/us-makes-huawei-trade-extension-official/">extended that temporary authority</a> to run through mid-February, but the approvals it is now issuing will provide longer-term certainty for both Huawei and its suppliers.</p>
