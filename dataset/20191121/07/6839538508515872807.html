      <p>A $7 bottle of wine has taken out international Gold at one of Australia’s biggest wine competitions.</p>
      <p>Aldi’s $6.99 One Road South Australian and Heathcote Shiraz won the Great Australian Shiraz Challenge 2019, in a huge win for both Aldi and those of us too cheap to pay more than $10 a bottle.</p>
      <p>The supermarket’s One Road Gouldburn &amp; King Valley Cabernet Merlot 2018 - also an absolute steal for $6.99 - and A.C Byrne &amp; Co Margaret River Cabernet Merlot 2018 - just three dollars more at $9.99 - also took out Blue Gold in the Sydney International Wine Competition 2020.</p>

      <p>Aldi’s popular champagne, the Veuve Monsigny Brut Champagne, on the shelf for just $21.99, also managed to land itself a spot in the top 100 wines of the competition.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the supermarket giant released a list of its top products as voted by Australian customers.</p>
      <p>While the aforementioned champagne was expected to take out the alcohol category, Aldi shoppers instead dubbed the South Point Estate Rosé their top pick, retailing for just $4.99.</p>
