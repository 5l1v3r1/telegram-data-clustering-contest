      <p>This week alone, we clocked everyone from Amal Clooney to Rosie Huntington-Whitely wearing the hottest trend of the season: knee-high boots. Lucky us: On the heels of launching the perfect ankle boot just last month, <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a28590200/everlane-the-heel-boot-review/">Everlane</a> finally produced a knee-high pair that checks all the boxes. Praise be!!! The sustainable brand claims that the boots’ traditional retail value would be priced at more than $520, but it is selling them for just $250.</p>
      <p>For something as basic as these, we predict that strangers will be constantly stopping you on the street asking their origin story. Because, like, look at them...how could they <i>not</i>?!What have I been wearing this winter before I met these boots? I don’t know if it’s Everlane’s dreamy studio lighting, but they just look sooo smooth. Wow, I finally get why everyone is always describing leather as “buttery.” They are so chic, they look <i>just</i> like their runway counterparts but without the runway sticker tag.</p>

      <p>The San Francisco–based label tends to stick to the classics, so these boots mark a more trend-forward approach. This style is all about a clean silhouette, which Everlane nailed with this drop. They fall in line with the fashion industry’s ongoing love affair with the ’70s, so we plan to style them with prairie midi skirts and suede fringe ASAP.</p>
      <p>There’s no bulky side zipper on these knee-highs, so they won’t slouch awkwardly at your ankles and pinch as you walk, but the wide shaft and back pull tab allow you to easily slip them on over jeans. The brand released the style in three easy-to-wear colors. The bone-white boots remind me of vintage go-go boots, but the black and camel colors will be your new everyday shoe. Like Everlane’s other leather offerings, these boots are made in Italy from Italian leather. Designer brands who?</p>
