      <h1>What Hong Kong’s local elections mean for the protests</h1>
      <h2>First poll since unrest erupted is seen as referendum on pro-democracy movement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:01:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:01</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Leahy, Nicolle Liu</a></address>
      <p>Hong Kong will face its first electoral test of public opinion on Sunday since the start of anti-government protests in June. The polls for the city’s 18 district councils are typically focused on humdrum local issues, such as noise pollution and new developments.</p>
      <p>But while they will not fundamentally change Hong Kong’s political system, which critics say is stacked against the pro-democracy camp, they are a timely referendum on support for a protest movement that shows little sign of abating. </p>
      <p>The clashes in the past 10 days have been so severe that there has been speculation that the elections will be postponed. A group of protesters remains holed up in a university after more than a week of fierce fighting between <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8b362e58-09c2-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">police and demonstrators </a>on campuses across the Asian financial centre.</p>
      <p>Even the campaign for this year’s elections has been marred by violence. At least eight pro-democracy candidates or activists have been beaten up or attacked, including one who had part of his ear bitten off. An outspoken pro-Beijing councillor, who has been a critic of the demonstrations, was stabbed, and the offices of some pro-establishment councillors have been trashed. </p>
      <p>Will the elections help ease or inflame the tension?</p>
      <h3>What are the district council elections?</h3>
      <p>The British colonial government established the district councils to generate grassroots support for its policies after riots inspired by China’s Cultural Revolution in 1967. </p>
      <p>This year, 452 seats out of 479 are up for grabs and a record 4.13m people are registered to vote, up 12 per cent from four years ago. Pro-Beijing or pro-establishment parties, which have traditionally had the backing of big business, trade unions and the government, control nearly three-quarters of the seats. But pro-democracy parties are planning to field more than 500 candidates, a record number.</p>
      <p>The elections will be followed next year by a vote for the more important Legislative Council, Hong Kong’s de facto parliament. District councillors take up six of the 70 seats in the Legislative Council. </p>
      <h3>Why is this year's poll so important?</h3>
      <p>The protests, which have drawn popular support, have raised the pro-democracy camp’s hopes of a decisive win offering a chance to build a local support base that could help in the Legislative Council elections.</p>
      <p>District councillors also comprise 117 seats of the 1,200-member election committee that selects Hong Kong’s chief executive. This is dominated by pro-Beijing appointees but a foothold on the committee would provide democrats with a voice in the election.</p>
      <p>The authorities have banned Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigner <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11b3cfba-f70a-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654">Joshua Wong</a> from participating in this Sunday’s district council elections but allowed other hardline protest leaders to run, including some “localists” — those campaigning with the slogan “Regain Hong Kong, revolution of our times”. </p>
      <h3>How do the two sides view their chances?</h3>
      <p>Some pro-establishment candidates and incumbents fear an electoral bloodbath. “Carrie Lam has betrayed us. We sat on the same boat but she never consults our opinions,” said Kam Man-fung, an incumbent pro-establishment district councillor, referring to Hong Kong’s chief executive. </p>
      <p>Other pro-Beijing figures point to their recovery from difficult patches, such as in 2003 when the government’s attempt to pass an anti-subversion law backed by Beijing led to mass protests and electoral losses. “We have been more pragmatic when it comes to community issues,” said Tam Yiu-chung, a senior member of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the territory’s largest pro-Beijing party. </p>
      <p>By contrast, the protest movement has inspired first-time anti-government candidates. “I may not be able to be at the protest frontline fighting but I am fighting the war in the local community and for the minds of the people,” said Kinda Li, a 28-year-old social worker.</p>
      <p>He decided to run because he witnessed a young protester attempting to commit suicide. “We, especially the younger ones, never thought of participating in the election previously. But now we think every . . . aspect of civil society is important. We hope to regain Hong Kong, bit by bit.” </p>
      <p>But academics say it would be very difficult for the pro-democracy camp to win a majority. “That would be a very high bar,” said Ma Ngok, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>
      <h3>What next?</h3>
      <p>Academics warn the election will not quell the violent protests unless the government responds to the movement’s demands. Protesters want universal suffrage for the city’s leader; an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality; an amnesty for those arrested; and for protesting not to be classified as rioting, an offence that carries up to 10 years jail in Hong Kong. </p>
      <p>Sing Ming, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, warned: “If the pro-establishment wins the majority, the protest may worsen.”</p>
