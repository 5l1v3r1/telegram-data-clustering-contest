      <p>Ghanaian rap artiste and recent BET Award winner Sarkodie is in the news again and this time not for winning an international award but for allegedly extorting money from fans in Italy.</p>
      <p>The rapper was fingered in a case of extortion by one social media user, stephanie.frema in a comment section on social media where she accused Sarkodie of allegedly charging his fans €10 for a selfie each during a recent show in Italy.</p>
      <p>The screenshot of her claim was sighted by <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/">Ghbase.com</a> on Instagram gossip page, those_called_clebs.</p>
      <p>It is not known what show he attended in Italy but according to her Sarkodie charged anyone who wished to take a selfie with him an amount of €10.</p>
      <p>She was reacting to a photo of <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/sarkodie-tried-to-subtly-diss-shatta-wale-again-as-he-takes-the-famous-advice-wine-glass-to-4syte-mtn-music-video-awards/">Sarkodie holding a wineglass at the 2019 4Syte Music Video Awards to probably spite Shatta Wale.</a></p>
      <p><b>“no wonder when he came to italy he collected 10 euro from anyone who wanna take pic with him. But @shattawalenima was free and lovely,”</b> she commented.</p>
      <p>To clarify her claim, she asked the gossip to ask anyone in Italy who attended the show.</p>
      <p><b>“Oh yess ask anyone in italy who attended some, he likes maoney paa”</b> she added.</p>
