      <p>The 18-year-old, who has reportedly returned to Auchenhowie, scored in a 3-0 development team win over Partick Thistle on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It's claimed the former Newcastle youngster could now be offered a full-time deal to move to Scotland after his release from the EPL side.</p>
      <p>Former England star Gazza is a legendary figure around Ibrox.</p>
      <p>He joined the club from Italian outfit Lazio and spent three years with the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Light Blues</a> before joining Middlesbrough.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Scottish boxing legend <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4976092/rangers-flanagan-boxing-billy-nelson/">Billy Nelson has praised Gers ace Jon Flanagan</a> and even offered to train all of his team-mates too.</p>
      <p>The defender trained with renowned boxing coach Nelson yesterday as he stepped up extra fitness work to get back into the first team.</p>
      <p>Opportunities in Steven Gerrard's side have been few and far between for the 26-year-old as he battles back from injury.</p>
      <p>He recently featured in the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4962087/wrexham-rangers-celtic-ibrox-challenge-cup/">Rangers Colts side who beat Wrexham 2-0</a> in the Tunnock's Caramel Wafer Cup last week.</p>
      <p>But Nelson, was full of kind words for the Scouser, and admits he would love to help out Gerrard's men gain an extra edge in the title race over <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a>.</p>
