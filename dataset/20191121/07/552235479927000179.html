      <p>Former First Minister <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alex-salmond">Alex Salmond</a> is due to appear in court over a series of sexual assault and attempted rape charges.</p>
      <p>The preliminary hearing is due to take place at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">High Court in Edinburgh</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Salmond faced a total of 14 charges, including two counts of attempted rape, when he appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court later this year on January 24.</p>
      <p>He has previously denied the allegations and said he will defend himself "to the utmost" in court.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The 64-year-old was Scotland's First Minister from 2007 to 2014.</p>
      <p>The result of the 2014 referendum - a 55% to 45% vote to stay in the UK - led to him stepping down as First Minister and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-national-party">SNP</a> leader.</p>
      <p>A full trial is expected to take place early next year.</p>
