      <p>KARACHI: London-based Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain has asked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to grant political asylum to him and his associates.</p>
      <p>He made the request during a speech aired on social media from his London abode earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“If India and Prime Minister Modi allow me to come to India and provide me asylum with my colleagues, I am ready to come to India along with my colleagues because my grandfather is buried there ... my grandmother is buried there ... my thousands of relatives are buried in India. I want to go to their graves and want to pray,” he said in the video message broadcast on social media on Nov 9.</p>
      <p>Mr Hussain, a British citizen who has been living in the United Kingdom for the past 27 years, is currently on bail in a case pertaining to incitement of violence. He was arrested twice in the UK, first in connection with a money laundering investigation and then in the present case.</p>
      <p>His party, now called MQM-London, is facing a ban since Aug 22, 2016 when Mr Hussain made an incendiary speech. The MQM here, now known as MQM-Pakistan, parted ways with him after the controversial speech.</p>
      <p>“[If granted asylum] I will not interfere in any politics, I promise,” assured Mr Hussain to the Indian government in his speech.</p>
