      <p>In a recent post on Instagram, Natasha Khalid Lakhani, owner of Natasha Salon and the grand daughter of Madam Noor Jehan, shared a picture of her expecting self with a heartfelt caption describing her journey to motherhood.</p>
      <p>She started off with a few recitations – possibly to drive away any evil sight, followed by expressing her feelings regarding her current state. “<i>Rabbi innee nazartou laka ma fee batnee muharraran fataqabbal minnee innaka anta alssameeAAu alAAaleem. </i>I am absolutely ecstatic to finally share the news with all of you. I am en route to undertaking my most important creative assignment. My journey as a Mother.”</p>

      <p>Although her beaming smile in the picture while staring at her baby bump was sufficient to deliver how grateful the stylist felt, she went onto add, “For someone who’s biggest passion has been creativity, it’s been a humbling experience to be privy to one of the most beautiful of Allah’s blessings.” She remarked her unmatched credentials in terms of her profession, while hinting at the kind of creative development that is taking form inside of her.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a journey that’s been equally internal as it has external. It has made me more fearless, thankful and has opened my heart in a way nothing has before.” Natasha reiterated her feelings, claiming that they have made her stronger, following which she went onto refer to herself as a ‘woman of this place’, or position.</p>
      <p>“There is so much I want to share with all of you as a woman from this place I find myself at, be it body, beauty, mind or soul. For now, though, I just want to celebrate this moment with all of you, and send tons of love and gratitude towards each and every one of you.”</p>
      <p>Natasha concluded with a request for her followers to remember her and her unborn child in their prayers.</p>
