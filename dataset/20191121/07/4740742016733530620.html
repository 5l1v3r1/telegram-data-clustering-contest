      <h1>Pharmacist's warning over fake Viagra which could kill you</h1>
      <h2>A pharmacist said the ingredients in counterfeit tablets are "dangerous" and "staggering"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Men are being warned about a dangerous fake Viagra containing toxic drywall, road paint and cleaning products, which could be fatal.</p>
      <p>Pfizer, the company who developed the erectile dysfunction drug, states that although there are many websites that claim to sell Viagra, around 80 per cent of these are counterfeits, reports <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/warning-over-fake-viagra-could-3553360">Plymouth Live.</a></p>
      <p>These pills are illegal, can be toxic, unsanitary and in some cases, deadly.</p>
      <p>David Massie, registered pharmacist at Dr Andrews Online Pharmacy, said counterfeit tablets are "dangerous".</p>
      <p>Ingredients found in counterfeit Viagra include, drywall, road paint, detergent, anti-fungal medication, cleaning products, talcum powder and amphetamines.</p>
      <p>Mr Massie said: "The number of dangerous things found in fake Viagra is staggering. The individuals behind the propagation of these counterfeit pills do not consider your health when producing them, only their profits.</p>
      <p>“When a doctor or pharmacist prescribes you Viagra, they consider all the other medications you might taking. Unlicensed sites are concerned only with their financial gain and not with drug interactions – mixing inappropriate medications together can often result in death.</p>
      <p>"At Dr Andrews, we encourage you to be vigilant in ensuring what you are taking is real, approved and regulated Viagra from a registered source.”</p>
      <h3>Here are some ways to ensure what you have is the real deal:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It has smooth edges. Fake Viagra will have rough edges.</li>
        <li>Viagra only comes in packs of four. Any more than four pills to a pack are counterfeit.</li>
        <li>There should be no variations in colour. Viagra will always be solid blue.</li>
        <li>The f in Pfizer should not narrow until the top. In fake Viagra the ‘f’ narrows just past the letter ‘i’.</li>
        <li>A package without an expiration date or a poorly printed expiration date is a fake.</li>
        <li>Pfizer always have a hologram on the boxes. No hologram – not genuine.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you feel something is not right with the Viagra you received, then do not take it.</p>
      <p>If you have already ingested what you believe to be counterfeit Viagra, contact your doctor immediately.</p>
