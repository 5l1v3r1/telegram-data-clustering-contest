      <h3>Duke of York ready to give evidence in US Epstein investigation</h3>
      <p>Buckingham Palace is braced. The Duke of York is preparing to give <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbb8">formal evidence to a US criminal investigation</a> into the disgraced paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In an unprecedented move, the Duke last night announced he was stepping back from public life in the wake of a BBC interview over his friendship with the financier that backfired in spectacular fashion. Read <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbb9">his full statement</a>. Now Chief Reporter <b>Robert Mendick</b> reveals that royal officials are expecting American authorities to <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbba">issue Prince Andrew with a subpoena</a> - requesting he gives testimony under oath over his links to Epstein. Sources have suggested the summons is "imminent". Meanwhile, it can be revealed that the Duke <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbbb">held a secret meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell</a> in London two weeks after US prosecutors announced they wanted to reopen their Epstein investigation.</p>
      <p>A well-placed royal source said the Queen summoned the Duke to Buckingham Palace to effectively sack her second-born son from official duties, ordering him to stand aside. The extraordinary move came four days after Andrew gave a 50-minute interview to Newsnight. He had hoped it would draw a line under his friendship with Epstein. Instead, the Duke's failure to show sympathy for the victims provoked outrage and scorn. <b>Camilla Tominey</b> has a full recap of <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbbc">how the Duke authored his own downfall</a> by deciding to go public in a PR disaster. And why <i>does</i> Fergie feel the need to be <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbbd">her ex-husband's staunchest defender</a>?</p>
      <h3>Elderly will keep homes under Johnson's social care pledge</h3>
      <p>The Prime Minister has vowed to "end the injustice" of people having to sell their family home to pay for social care. <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbbe">Pledging to prevent elderly people being forced to sell up</a>, Boris Johnson announced a £5billion cash injection to ease the funding crisis. Meanwhile, Labour will promise to sweep aside anti-strike laws and <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbbf">reverse Margaret Thatcher's flagship right to buy policy</a> today. It comes as a new Savanta ComRes poll gives the Tories <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbc0">their biggest lead for more than two years</a> - showing almost one in five Labour voters is considering switching to the Conservatives.

      <h3>Extinction Rebellion co-founder sparks Holocaust row</h3>
      <p>One of the founders of Extinction Rebellion is facing possible expulsion from the movement over remarks allegedly questioning the significance of the Holocaust. While <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbc2">comparing the genocide to climate change now</a>, Roger Hallam reportedly said it was "just another f---ery in human history". Meanwhile, Religious Affairs Editor <b>Gabriella Swerling</b> reveals that a Church of England report says Christian anti-Semitism dating back centuries is <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd915418,330bdbac,330bdbc3">to blame for the Holocaust</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Life-saving whales</b> | When Hollywood came up with the plot for Star Trek IV - that whales would one day save the Earth from apocalyptic weather - it was thought to be one of the most far-fetched storylines of all time.
