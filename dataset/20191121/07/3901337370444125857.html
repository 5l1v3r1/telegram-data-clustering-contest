      <p>The Glamour Boys haven’t lifted a single trophy since winning the 2014/15 Absa Premiership title more than four years ago, with Steve Komphela and Giovanni Solinas both unable to continue Stuart Baxter’s impressive trophy haul. </p>
      <p>Now though, with Ernst Middendorp back for his second stint, the Amakhosi are into the Telkom Knockout semi-finals and sitting pretty on top of the Absa Premiership table after 11 games played.</p>
      <p>Bernard Parker, who has been a key performer for the club this season, is eager for them to go all the way in the TKO – the only trophy Chiefs didn’t win under Baxter – starting with a tough game against Maritzburg United on Sunday afternoon. </p>
      <p>Speaking to Chiefs ‘official website, the 33-year-old said, “It’s so important for us to reach the final… It’s do or die time. With the quality that we have, and if everyone gives their all and is fully focused, we can do that. I think we’ve done that well so far, and big ups to the senior players who have kept the guys close. We have our focus which is to play well and win, getting to the final will boost our confidence sky high.”</p>
      <p>Parker, who has scored against the Team of Choice in cup games before, also added, “We have faced them over the years in crucial cup games. I was not really aware that I have scored against them in cup games, it will be good to score again. As much as I am contributing to the team, I would like to add goals to my game to help the team go even further. it is a psychological boost going into this game, and for me to make something out of it, given the chance.”</p>

      <p>Chiefs host Maritzburg at 15h00 on Sunday in Nelspruit, by which time they’ll know whether it is Mamelodi Sundowns or Golden Arrows who will be their potential opposition at Moses Mabhida on December 14. </p>
