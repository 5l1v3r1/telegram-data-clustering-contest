      <h1>Temporary bollards are back in Upper Parliament Street to stop drivers turning right</h1>

      <p>Temporary bollards have been installed a busy road in Nottingham city centre to help alleviate traffic.</p>
      <p>The bollards were previously installed last year to help address traffic problems caused by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/motoring/">drivers</a> turning into and out of the Euro Car Park in Upper Parliament Street during the busy festive period.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/traffic-travel">Drivers</a> heading east along the road in one lane are no longer able to turn right into the car park.</p>
      <p>There are two lanes on the road heading west towards Tollhouse Hill. Drivers are still able to turn left into the car park from that side of the road.</p>
      <p>The bollards span along the road to The Three Crowns pub near the tram tracks and finish just past the Euro Car Park.</p>
      <p>Nottingham City Council previously said the bollards in 2018 had a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/temporary-bollards-upper-parliament-street-2428872">"noticeable improvement" and "positive impact" on traffic.</a></p>
