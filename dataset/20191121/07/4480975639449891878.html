      <h1>Gold flirting with session lows, around $1470 region</h1>

          <b>Gold failed to capitalize on the recent recovery move despite trade uncertainty.</b>

          <b>Fed's patience stance seemed to be the only factor weighing on the commodity.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">Gold</a> edged lower through the Asian session on Thursday and is currently placed near the lower end of its daily trading range, around the $1470 region.<br/> <br/>The safe-haven precious metal witnessed some follow-through selling on Thursday and extended the previous session's late pullback from the vicinity of the 100-day SMA barrier, or near two-week tops, despite uncertainty over a phase one US-China trade deal.<br/> <br/>The US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs if phase one of a trade deal is not signed. Tensions between the two countries intensified further after the US Senate unanimously passed the Hong Kong Humans Right and Democracy Act bill on Tuesday.<br/> <br/>Adding to this, reports on Wednesday suggested that the US and China may not reach a preliminary trade pact before next year, which shattered hopes of a partial agreement and weighed on the global risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> – evident from weaker tone around equity markets.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, some renewed US dollar weakness also did little to lend any support to the dollar-denominated commodity. The fact that <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> minutes on Wednesday indicated to keep policy on hold for a while seemed to be the only factor driving flows away from the non-yielding yellow metal.<br/> <br/>From a technical perspective, the commodity's inability to capitalize on the recent recovery move from three-month tops and repeated failures near a previous strong support-turned-resistance suggests that the recent bearish pressure might still be far from being over.<br/> <br/>Hence, some follow-through weakness, back towards testing weekly lows around the $1455 region, now looks a distinct possibility amid absent relevant market-moving US economic releases on Thursday.</p>
