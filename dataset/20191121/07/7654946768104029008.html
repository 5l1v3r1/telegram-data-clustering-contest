      <h1>Democratic debates: Drag Queen Pissi Myles quizzes Kamala Harris</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:09:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:09</time> by <a rel="author">Marisa Schultz and Ben Feuerherd</a></address>
      <p>The New York City drag Queen who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/drag-queen-pissi-myles-storms-into-trump-impeachment-hearings/">attended an impeachment hearing on Capitol Hill last week</a> traveled to Atlanta Wednesday for the Democratic debate and managed to eek out a question to one of the candidates during a media scrum.</p>
      <p>Pissi Myles — wearing a sequin dress, a huge blonde wig and jewels — joined the gaggle of reporters after the debate and asked Sen. Kamala Harris about Transgender Day of Remembrance, which she said was observed Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“I have a long history of working on this. And to your point today, black trans women are under attack,” Harris told Myles, who was reporting for HappsNews.</p>
      <p>“They are being hunted. And we’ve got to address this in very real way,” she added.</p>
      <p>Myles told the Post that she’s been working as a political reporter for HappsNews since the political director of the media start-up discovered her at a bar in New York and offered her the job.</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday, the award-winning performer was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/drag-queen-pissi-myles-shocked-she-was-most-interesting-part-of-impeachment-day/">spotted stalking the halls</a> of the Longworth building in a red latex dress and giant blonde wig to cover the hearings.</p>
      <p>“It was a lot of fun but it was very serious,” said Myles, 31, whose character is a riff on the actress Missi Pyle.</p>
