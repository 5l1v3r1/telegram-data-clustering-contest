      <h2>The origin story of the Gotham villian has become the highest grossing R-rated film of all time</h2>

      <p>Director Todd Phillips is likely to reteam with star Joaquin Phoenix for a sequel to the $1 billion-grossing R-rated hit <i>Joker,</i> says a source.</p>
      <p>Talk of the sequel has been rife since the film’s critically acclaimed premiere at the Venice film festival in August, but confirmation has proved elusive, reports <i>theguardian.com.</i></p>
      <p>According to the <i>Hollywood Reporter</i>, such a project is now in final-stage discussion, with the publication asserting that Phillips and Phoenix are “likely to reteam”.</p>
      <p>The director will write the screenplay to the sequel along with co-writer Scott Silver, with whom he worked on the original’s script, sources told the <i>Hollywood Reporter.</i></p>
      <p>The initial box office numbers scored by <i>Joker </i>were enough for Warner Bros to agree to Phillips’s request to direct another DC Comics origins story — tipped to be Lex Luthor. <i>Batman</i> is already being shot by Matt Reeves, with Robert Pattinson in the lead.</p>
