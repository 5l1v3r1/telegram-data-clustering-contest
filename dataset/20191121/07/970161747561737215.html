      <p>Robbie Walsh has absolutely no time for ‘unnecessary’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/louis-walsh/">Louis Walsh</a>, following his comments about wife Ayda Field.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity judge recently hit out at the Angels singer for bringing his wife on the panel last year, claiming that Nicole Scherzinger or Sharon Osbourne would have been more suited to the role.</p>
      <p>Side note: That’s probably something you need to take up with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a>, hun.</p>
      <p>But the former Take That star wasn’t too thrilled about his remark, blasting him as ‘feeble’.</p>
      <p>Discussing the jibe, he said: ‘When people say things about me, I know I’ll have the opportunity to get them back. So I’m not alright with it, but I’m like, “right, noted, you’re on the list”.</p>
      <p>‘When it happens to your loved ones… I had a panic attack.</p>

      <p>‘I was like, “I don’t know what to do with this feeling”. It was just uncalled-for and unnecessary. It says something about him. It’s the actions of a feeble man.’</p>

      <p>But, in true Robbie style, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/robbie-williams-it-feels-great-to-say-louis-walsh-is-a-feeble-man-1.4062623">the 45-year-old added to the Irish Times</a>: ‘It’s great to have opportunities to say he’s a feeble man.’</p>
      <p>His words come after Louis mocked Ayda’s stint on the X Factor panel last year, and slammed the singer for asking her to join him.</p>
      <p>‘I thought he was a brilliant booking, but then he went and brought his wife on the show,’ he told The Sun. ‘You don’t bring your wife to work.</p>

      <p>‘Nicole or Sharon would have been better.’</p>
      <p>Well, we thought Ayda was great.</p>
      <p>But Louis isn’t the only one Robbie is slamming, as he also took a second to reignite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/robbie-williams-reckons-oasis-comeback-wouldnt-patch-take-actually-serious-11189410/">his feud with Noel and Liam Gallagher</a>.</p>
      <p>In fact, he claimed that when – not if – the pair reunite Oasis, the Wonderwall singers will have a hard time matching up to Take That.</p>
      <p>Chatting to Music Week, he said: ‘When Oasis eventually get back together in five or 10 years’ time, there’ll be a wry smile that they won’t sell as many tickets as we did..’</p>
      <p>And, just like that, we’re back in the 90s.</p>
      <p>Over to you, Gallagher brothers…</p>
