      <p>After 21 years of marriage, Arjun Rampal and Mehr Jesia are no longer a married a couple.</p>
      <p>Rampal and Jesia, who have two teenage daughters Mahikaa (17) and Myra (13), first made headlines about their separation back in 2011. However, it was only earlier this year, the news was made official.</p>
      <p><i>Mumbai Mirror</i> reports that the principal judge Shailaja Sawant granted the divorce under the Special Marriage Act. It also stated that Mahikaa and Myra will reside with their mother in Bandra.</p>
      <p>A court official was cited in the publication saying, “After a petition for divorce by mutual consent is filed, their plea is scrutinised, registered and then, the couple is referred to a marriage counsellor to attempt a reconciliation. If that fails, the couple is given six more months to work things out. Six months later, if they are resolute in their decision to part ways and have complied with the terms of divorce mutually agreed to between them, a court draws up a decree of divorce.”</p>
      <p>A post by the couple on social media said, “After a 20-year-long beautiful journey filled with love and beautiful memories, we would like to share, that all journeys have different paths. We feel that it is time for us to move on to different destinations henceforth. We have always been solid when it has come to us, we will continue to be solid for each other and our loved ones, as we embark upon a new journey. We are a family, our love for each other is forever intact and we shall always be there for one another and most importantly, for our children Mahikaa and Myra. We would, therefore, appreciate our privacy through this time. Thank all for their support. Relationships can end, but love lives on.”</p>
