      <p>The driver, a 24-year-old man from Sefton, died at the scene.</p>
      <p>The front seat passenger, a 18-year-old man from Sefton – was taken to Aintree Hospital where he remains in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>Police believe the white Audi A1 had been stolen during a burglary in Eccleston, eight miles away, earlier that morning.</p>
      <p>Thieves also stole a red Abarth from the same home and officers believe this car might have been travelling in convoy with the Audi</p>
      <p>The Abarth was discovered abandoned in the Merseyside area. Police said they want to speak to any witnesses who might have witnessed the fatal crash.</p>
      <p>Sgt Paul Maguire said: "Firstly my thoughts are with the family and friends of both of these men at this incredibly distressing time. We have specially trained officers supporting them.</p>
      <p>"I am asking anyone who saw the Audi and also the Abarth travelling in the area, or indeed the collision itself, to come forward.</p>
      <p>"Similarly, if you have any dash cam footage that could assist our investigation, please make contact with us.<br/><br/>"Lastly, I would like to directly appeal to the people who were in the Abarth to speak to the police.</p>
      <p>"A man has died and another is extremely ill in hospital so it’s important we find out exactly what happened."</p>
      <p>A three-mile stretch of the A59, one of the busiest roads in West Lancashire, was closed for around six hours whilst police investigated.</p>
