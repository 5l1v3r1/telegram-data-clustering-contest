      <p>NXT Champion Adam Cole and Dominik Dijakovic faced each other in a Ladder match on tonight's episode of the Black-and-Gold brand. Both the Superstars gave their all to win the battle and eventually, it was the leader of The Undisputed Era who emerged as the victor. Owing to his win, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/adam-cole">Adam Cole</a> and his team will have a significant advantage during their match against Team Ciampa at NXT TakeOver: WarGames this weekend.</p>
      <h3>Adam Cole's reaction</h3>
      <p>The NXT Champion took to Twitter following his match against Dominik Dijakovic to comment on his victory and he seemed pretty confident about leading his team to victory at <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> TakeOver: WarGames</p>
      <blockquote>Bring on #WarGames...not only do we have the advantage, but Iâ€™m on the run of a damn lifetime right now. #UEisNXT #AdamColeBayBay</blockquote>

      <p>At the pay-per-view, Adam Cole, Bobby Fish, Kyle O'Reilly, and Roderick Strong will collide against <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/tommaso-ciampa">Tommaso Ciampa</a>, Keith Lee, Dominik Dijakovic and another soon-to-be-revealed Superstar in a WarGames match. They will have a two-on-one advantage over Team Ciampa from the get-go but as it's a WarGames match, we can't really predict which squad will turn out to be the winner.</p>
      <p>Less than 24 hours after the conclusion of NXT TakeOver: WarGames, Adam Cole is set to defend the NXT Championship against either of Pete Dunne, Killian Dain or Damian Priest at WWE Survivor Series.</p>
      <p>Will the leader of The Undisputed Era be able to make it out of the Survivor Series weekend? We will have our answers very soon.</p>
