      <p>Kumawood actor popularly known as Ogyam has descended heavily on Komfo Kolege (Guy Jesus) and Kobby 1 (Fair Jesus) for imitating Mmebusem ‘Ghana Jesus’.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive interview with GhPage TV, Ogyam fired these Kumawood actors for copying Mmebusem and trying to bring him down.</p>
      <p>Ogyam explained how Salinko decided to introduce Mmebusem to the ‘Ghana Jesus’ idea after he returned from the United States of America.</p>
      <p>He revealed that after the video went viral, Mmebusem requested more money but Salinko refused to heed to his offer which infuriated him and later decided to start his own production.</p>
      <p>Salinko who felt betrayed rained curses on Mmebusem for being ungrateful and ordered him to bring back his ‘Jesus’ attire.</p>
      <p>However, recently two Kumawood actors have also decided to imitate Mmebusem and also act as the local Jesus.</p>
      <p>Popular Kumawood actor Komfo Kolege known for his fetish priest roles has also rebranded himself as Guy Jesus.</p>
      <p>Another Kumawood actor Kobby 1 was introduced by Salinko to replace Mmebusem as the New Jesus.</p>
      <p>According to Ogyam, he cannot comprehend why these actors will imitate Mmebusem while they can also coin their own idea.</p>
      <p>He rained insults on them labeling them as hypocrites adding that this is one of the main reasons why the movie industry is failing.</p>

      <p>Ogyam explained that there is so much hatred, backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, and selfishness in the Kumawood movie industry.</p>
      <p>According to Ogyam, Mmebusem has already been accepted by Ghanaians as the ‘Ghana Jesus’ and no one can bring him down.</p>
