        <b>Jeremy Corbyn  will tell voters Labour will create the biggest affordable-home-building drive since the 1960s as he announces the party’s manifesto.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ambitious scheme will use up half of Labour’s £150bn, five year “social transformation fund”.</p>
      <p>It comes after Boris Johnson last night pledged fresh help for renters and vowed to build one million homes by 2025 if he wins a majority next month.</p>

The manifesto will contain intentions to significantly boost NHS spending, create a £10 minimum hourly wage for all, and tackle climate change by creating jobs in a “green industrial revolution”. A spree of social house building – the largest since the 1960s – will also feature, with a £75 billion plan, paid for through borrowing, to construct 150,000 homes a year. Labour has a lot of support to catch up on before December 12. The latest Telegraph/Savanta ComRes poll gives the Conservatives a double-figure lead of 11 points over Labour – the largest Tory lead seen by the poling company since before the 2017 snap election.</li>

The Prime Minister confirmed he would hike thresholds for National Insurance from £8,600 to £12,500 on a visit to Teesside. A worker at a factory on the River Tees asked him: “”You said low tax, do you mean low tax for people like you or low tax for people like us?” And he told them: “We are cutting tax for working people.” It means anyone earning under £12,500 on Pay As You Earn (through an employer) will be taken out of paying National Insurance altogether in five years. Everyone earning more than that could see a tax cut of around £460 a year by the end of that time. While Jeremy Corbyn’s radical plans to increase taxes for the wealthy could cost the economy £1billion, it was suggested yesterday. Labour proposals would hit the pockets of 1.6million Brits while the actual revenue it would raise is “highly uncertain”, experts claim. The plans will increase the contributions of people earning more than £80k a year from April 2020, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) The IFS suggests this is in line with Labour's commitment for just the top fiver per cent of earners to be asked to pay more. However, the economists also said it would affect “ever more people over time”, with approximately 1.9 million people having incomes exceeding £80,000 in 2023/24. Brits thinks a hung parliament is the most likely outcome after the election, with the Conservatives the biggest party. Pollsters Ipsos MORI found the nation reckon the Brexit nightmare is set to continue, with no party winning an outright majority. They revealed 30 per cent of Brits think Boris Johnson will get more seats than Jeremy Corbyn, but still not enough for an outright majority. In yet another blow to the leftie leader, just 11 per cent think Labour will take enough seats to form a majority, compared to 27 per cent who back the Tories.</li>

The Sun revealed that <u><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10380631/students-registered-to-vote-without-knowledge/">Labour-controlled Plymouth Council broke the law by registering 850 students without their permission</a></u>. That included 247 17-year-olds, who are too young to vote. But it has now emerged that the shady practice that Tories think is a bid to boost the leftwing vote could be taking place nationwide. Multiple reports were made to The Sun today by concerned parents. They said their offspring had been sent polling cards out of the blue at their addresses in university towns all over England, despite never requesting to vote there. Read our full report here.</li>

The party opened an investigation into <u><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10380989/labour-anti-semitism-activist-leaflet/">Kierin Offlands</a></u>, a Labour activist and a former local party official, over a series of tweets inciting hatred towards Jews and comparing Israel to Nazi Germany. Mr Offlands was featured on the front cover of a prominent campaign leaflet sent to thousands of households – titled “Real Change for Young Workers”. After The Sun revealed further <u><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4548219/labour-anti-semitism-row-jeremy-corbyn/">anti-Semitic slurs</a></u> the Labour Party issued a statement announcing they had ditched the leaflet.
