      <p>A young GrabFood delivery rider who helped a senior citizen cross the road and walk over to her block has won praise online. The incident took place outside Toa Payoh polyclinic today (20 Nov), according to an eyewitness.</p>
      <p>Sharing a video of the delivery rider accompanying an elderly woman while wearing his delivery bag and holding onto his bicycle with his free hand, Facebook user Eileena Lee said that she was touched by the delivery rider’s kindness.</p>
      <p>When Ms Lee approached the pair and offered to help the elderly lady so that the young man could continue with his delivery, the young man politely declined and continued taking the senior citizen to her block. Ms Lee recalled:</p>
