      <p>The film is an adaptation of Aravind Adiga’s prize-winning novel of the same name. It follows the extraordinary journey of a self-made man from being a tea-shop worker in a village to a successful entrepreneur in a big city.</p>
      <p>Chopra will also voice the character of Elsa in the Hindi version of the Disney film, <i>Frozen 2</i>. Her cousin Parineeti Chopra has lent her voice for the character of Elsa’s sister Anna. However, the actor’s latest film <i>The Sky Is Pink</i>  got a mixed response from critics and under-performed at the box office.</p>
