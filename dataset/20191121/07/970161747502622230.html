      <p>Don’t get too angry if you didn’t get an invite to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cristiano-ronaldo/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s ‘wedding’.</p>
      <p>The footballer has denied that he has married longtime girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez, following reports they tied the knot in Morocco.</p>
      <p>Italian gossip magazine Novella 2000 reported that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/cristiano-ronaldo-marries-girlfriend-georgina-rodriguez-intimate-moroccan-wedding-11191636/">the couple may have married back in May</a>, with an insider adding that Ronaldo, 34, had changed his will to protect Georgina, 25.</p>
      <p>However, a rep for Ronaldo <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/20/cristiano-ronaldo-not-married-georgina-rodriguez-wedding/">told TMZ Sports</a>: ‘He has not got married’ – with another rep saying the report was ‘fake news’.</p>

      <p>Former shop assistant Georgina admitted in February she would love to become the Portuguese star’s wife but shut down speculation they were already engaged.</p>
      <p>She told glossy Spanish magazine Hola! he had yet to ask for her hand in marriage, but she admitted: ‘Every couple wants to get married and I would love to personally.</p>

      <p>‘Right how we have priorities and a lot of responsibilities, although in the future it would be marvellous to become Cristiano’s wife.’</p>
      <p>Cristiano forged his relationship with Georgina in 2016 during lock-ins at the upmarket clothes store in Madrid where she used to work.</p>

      <p>She soon became his first serious girlfriend since he broke up with Russian beauty Irina Shayk at the start of 2015.</p>
      <p>He moved her into his luxury home on a gated estate on the outskirts of the Spanish capital before setting up home with her in Turin, and they welcomed their first child together, Alana, in 2017.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo is also dad to Cristiano Jr, nine, and two-year-old twins Eva Maria and Mateo, who he welcomed via surrogate.</p>
      <p>Last year the footballer’s mum said of Georgina during a magazine interview about her son’s love life: ‘She is the mother of my grand-daughter. She is a future daughter-in-law. She’s not my daughter-in-law yet. She’s a future daughter-in-law. She’s a very calm person.’</p>
      <p>So perhaps a wedding isn’t too far off.</p>
