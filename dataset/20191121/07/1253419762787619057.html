      <h1>Sea of Thieves November 2019 Update, The Seabound Soul, is now available for download</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:09:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:09</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Rare has announced that the November 2019 Update for Sea of Thieves, The Seabound Soul, is now available for download. This new content update is available for free to all owners of the game, and you can download it via the Microsoft Store.</p>
      <p>The Seabound Soul features a brand-new Tall Tale for players to experience, as they embark on a quest to uncover the mystery of the legendary Captain Pendragon and his ship, the Blackwyche. The update also introduces fire that players can use to set ships alight as an all-new combat and disruption mechanic. Players can also find firebombs across the world that they can shot from cannons to catch enemy ships ablaze.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth noting that this new update adds a total of 40 new achievements. Once you unlock them, these achievements will remain in the game indefinitely.</p>
      <p>This update also comes with a number of bug fixes. For instance, players should no longer become stuck between the shipwreck and dock in the Pirate Legend Hideout, to a tree on Smuggler’s Bay, and between rocks on Ashen Reaches. The update also addresses a clip issue when climbing the southeast ladder on Fort of the Damned.</p>
      <p>Lastly, you can find complete changelog for this latest update for Sea of Thieves <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/release-notes#tall-tales-the-seabound-soul-faq-tall-tales-the-seabound-soul">here</a>.</p>
