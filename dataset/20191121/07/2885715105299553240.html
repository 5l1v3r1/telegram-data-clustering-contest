      <h2>Actor-politician Kamal Haasan, who will be seen next in Indian 2, suffered a compound fracture in his right leg in 2016.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:20:55+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Actor-politician <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kamal-haasan/">Kamal Haasan</a> will be undergoing a surgery to remove an implant in his right leg, said an official statement from <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-does-makkal-needhi-maiam-mean-kamal-haasan-new-party-name-symbol-flag-5073149/">Makkal Needhi Maiam</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“In July 2016, Dr Kamal Haasan had an unfortunate accident resulting in a compound fracture in his right leg for which he had to undergo a surgical procedure during which an implant was placed. Due to his very busy schedule in political and film commitments, there had been a postponement in the removal of the implant. However, now upon his doctors’ advice, Dr Kamal Haasan will be getting admitted in the hospital for the surgical procedure on 22nd November 2019 to remove the implant. Furthermore, he has been compelled to take a break for the next few weeks to physically recoup,” read the official statement, which was issued by Dr R Mahendran, Vice President of Makkal Needhi Maiam.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that the leg fracture added to the woes of Kamal, who was going through some significant challenges in his personal and professional life. The injury happened when the actor was shooting for Sabaash Naidu. The film was a spin-off on the popular character Balram Naidu, which was one of the ten roles played by Kamal in the 2008 film Dasavathaaram. Director TK Rajeev Kumar was set to direct the comedy-thriller. However, just days into the shooting, he fell ill and had to be hospitalised. Following which, Kamal decided to take the responsibility of directing the film. During a scheduled break, Kamal suffered a leg fracture, which forced him to shelve the project for good.</p>
      <p>Around the same time, Kamal Haasan and his then live-in partner Gautami called it quits ending their 13-long-year relationship. While Kamal has so far never spoken a word about it, back then Gautami had written a long blog post announcing the breakup. She had noted that her relationship with Kamal had come to a “painful end”.</p>
