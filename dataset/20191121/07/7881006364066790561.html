      <p><b>Washington</b>: The US Navy on Wednesday began a procedure that could remove from its elite SEALs unit an officer accused of war crimes whom President Donald Trump pardoned last week.</p>
      <p>Along with three other unidentified members of his unit, Edward Gallagher, 40, was "notified today that a process will start to evaluate and look at their continued service as SEALs," spokeswoman for US special forces Tamara Lawrence told AFP.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A panel of Navy SEAL officers would convene in December to decide whether Gallagher can remain in the unit, Lawrence said.</p>
      <p>The panel will give its opinion to the commander of the US Navy special forces, Rear Admiral Collin Green, who will make recommendations to US Navy command, which will make a final decision, she added.</p>
      <p>In July, Gallagher was acquitted of charges related to the stabbing death of a wounded ISIS prisoner in Iraq, and of other killings of civilians.</p>
      <p>But he was convicted of posing with the slain fighter's body in a group picture with other SEALs.</p>
      <p>Gallagher's case was championed by Fox News, which is closely followed by Trump, and last week the president reversed the military court's decision to reduce Gallagher's demotion following his conviction.</p>
      <p>He also pardoned a former US soldier convicted of murder and a Green Beret charged with killing a suspected Taliban bomb-maker.</p>
      <p>Lawrence declined to say whether the proceedings started on Wednesday had been opened in response to Trump's moves.</p>
      <p>"Discussions have been ongoing since before the president's action," she said, but the sailors concerned "were notified today."</p>
      <p>The procedure is administrative and not legal, and even if they are excluded from the SEALs, they will be able to continue serving in the Navy.</p>
