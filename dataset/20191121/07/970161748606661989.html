      <p>The Apprentice’s Ryan-Mark Parsons has revealed that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/the-apprentice-viewers-spot-mystery-man-lying-on-the-floor-of-the-boardroom-and-there-are-so-many-questions-11124100/">mystery man lying on the floor of the boardroom was not him.</a></p>
      <p>The womenswear consultant, who was the latest candidate to be fired from the show, has finally put the record straight – but it means we may never find out who the mystery man really was.</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark’s fellow candidate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/apprentices-thomas-skinner-reveals-mystery-man-lying-boardroom-floor-really-11183963/">Thomas Skinner</a> took to social media to joke that the man lying on the floor of the boardroom was the 19-year-old.</p>
      <p>He originally tweeted: ‘People keep asking me who was the geeza laying on the floor under the table in last tasks boardroom! Well I can actually reveal it was @ryanmarkparsons.</p>
      <p>‘Foot masseuse, the #Pig flys him in from Hamburg every Wednesday to keep his feet relaxed during the boardroom! #TheApprentice.’</p>

      <p>But now our dreams are shattered because Ryan-Mark has confessed that it’s not actually him – and he doesn’t know the mystery man’s identity either.</p>
      <p><b>He told Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘I don’t know why people are accusing me of this, Thomas is stirring the pot, I have no idea who that was.</p>
      <p>‘He was saying that it was me and that my foot masseuse had flown in to give me a massage but I can assure you it wasn’t me.’</p>

      <p>Ryan-Mark, who was the youngest candidate on the show, continued to explain how despite this week’s task being a ‘disastrous’ one, he felt Lord Sugar’s decision to fire him was wrong.</p>
      <p>‘Lord Sugar did not make the right decision, I shouldn’t have been fired,’ he explained.</p>
      <p>‘If you look at Thomas, the only reason he was saved was because he decided to come back to the boardroom, I love Thomas but he has lost seven out of eight tasks and it was a disaster on his side.</p>
      <p>‘Marianne is a naïve person on task, who runs around in her own universe.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘And on task, she would be all over the place, she would be erratic and when it came to the boardroom she would attack you and be very condescending and patronising. She would really go for you.’</p>
