      <h2>Britain's former consul general in New York Sir Thomas Harris said he cannot recall Prince Andrew staying with him in the city when he visited in April 2001, despite the royal's claims that he did</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:55:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Britain's ex-consul general in New York has cast doubt on Prince Andrew's claim he stayed with him and not Jeffrey Epstein on a controversial trip.</p>
      <p>The royal said he stayed with the diplomat over the period that Virginia Roberts claimed to have slept with him in April 2001, when she was just 17-years-old.</p>
      <p>He admitted that he may have visited his paedophile ex-pal Epstein's home on the trip but denied staying at the property.</p>
      <p>Andrew insisted he slept at the consul-general's residence in his interview with BBC Newsnight on Saturday.</p>
      <p>However, Sir Thomas Harris, Britain's consul-general at the time, said he could not remember the royal staying with him.</p>

      <p>Sir Thomas told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7708371/Britains-ex-consul-general-New-York-casts-doubt-dukes-alibi.html">Mail Online</a>: "I have no recollection of him staying at the address in April. I don’t have a note of the dates of all the visits – the Palace will. It doesn’t ring any bell whatsoever."</p>
      <p>The retired diplomat said he no longer had his 2001 diary, which may have contained details about Andrew's activities.</p>
      <p>He added that overnight stays at the consul general's residence were usually logged in the Court Circular, however there was no record relating to the Prince.</p>

      <p>Ms Roberts, one of Epstein's alleged trafficking victims, said one of the three sexual encounters she claims to have had with Andrew took place during his Easter 2001 trip.</p>
      <p>He spent three days in New York and Boston during the official visit, although it is not clear where he stayed.</p>
      <p>At the time, The Mail on Sunday reported that he spent one night as the consul-general's guest and another at Epstein's home.</p>
      <p>The Prince has taken a temporary break from royal duties after the outcry over his BBC Newsnight interview.</p>
