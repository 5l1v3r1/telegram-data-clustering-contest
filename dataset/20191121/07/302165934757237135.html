      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 21 — A local Instagram influencer known as Sara Anna caused a stir online when she claimed that Malaysian men supposedly lack romantic finesse.</p>
      <p>A reposting of her Instagram Story where she lamented about first dates at the <i>mamak</i> went viral on Twitter and has gotten more than 800,000 views so far.</p>
      <p>“Most Malaysian guys like to bring me to the <i>mamak</i> and I don’t like that.</p>
      <p>“Sorry, I don’t want to be picky but I didn’t work hard just to loaf around at the <i>mamak</i>. I want to go for fine dining.</p>
      <p>“If we’ve been a long-time couple, maybe going to the <i>mamak</i> is okay but for the first 10 dates, I want fine dining,” she said in the video.</p>

      <p>The savvy entrepreneur told <i>mStar </i>that she was driven to make those comments due to her negative experiences with Malay men, who she accused of trying to mooch off her wealth.</p>
      <p>"I went out with a Malay guy recently and he invited me to the <i>mamak</i>, so I just followed him.</p>
      <p>“I’m the type to not care about going to the <i>mamak</i> but when it was time to pay the bill, he acted like he didn’t know any better.</p>
      <p>“He was trying to woo me but in the end, I ended up having to pay. It’s not great.</p>
      <p>“How would you like it if you glam yourself up, looking all vogue with high heels and you’re suddenly taken to the mamak?” she was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old went on to express a preference for Caucasian men, who she claimed knew how to treat women better when it comes to dating.</p>
      <p>“I like to befriend Caucasian men because they don’t know who I am.</p>
      <p>“I tell them I’m a cleaner but they still take me for fine dining without even asking me where I want to go. They are more gentlemanly.”</p>
      <p>She also denied allegations of being a gold-digger after social media users began scrutinising her dating history.</p>
      <p>“I tend to date older men. My ex is 40 years old but he’s not my sugar daddy.</p>
      <p>“People get me wrong because I’m always being labeled as a gold-digger but in reality, I’m successful because of my own hard work and effort,” said Sara, who heads companies selling ladies’ fashion and innerwear.</p>
      <p>Malaysians have expressed mixed reactions to her views, with some saying she was within her right to date whoever she prefers while others criticised her lofty standards in a partner.</p>
