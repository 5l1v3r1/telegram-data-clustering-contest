      <h1>Latest On Pirates Defender’s Proposed Move?</h1>

      <p>A proposed move for an Orlando Pirates defender could be snubbed as the January transfer window looms.   </p>
      <p>Following his much talked about move to Pirates at the end of last season, the switch from Chippa United has been a disappointment so far for Tebogo Tlolane. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Tlolane has had one substitute appearance for the Buccaneers so far this season, making him a shadow of the player he was for the Chilli Boys last term. </p>
      <p>The 24-year-old amassed 29 starts last season out of the Eastern Cape club’s 30 Absa Premiership matches.  </p>
      <p>With Chippa coach Norman Mapeza looking at strengthening his squad for the second half of the season, it is believed that Tlolane is one of the players targeted for a move to Port Elizabeth, as reported in edition 1150 of Soccer Laduma. </p>

      </p>
      <p>While Siya sources have confirmed that Chippa are keen on signing Messi, as Tlolane is known in football circles, indications are that the player would opt against the move in preference of continuing with a fight for a place in caretaker coach Rulani Mokwena's team.  </p>
      <p>“I don’t see it (Chippa move) happening. Yes, the boy is not playing at the moment but that doesn’t mean he is not in the plans at Pirates. He is happy at Pirates and working hard while waiting for his chance. I speak to him quite often and he’s not going anywhere as far as I know,” said the source.   </p>
