      <h1>Terrible traffic situation in Lagos is temporary —Commissioner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:36:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:36</time> by <a rel="author">Oluwakemi Abimbola</a></address>
      <p>The Lagos State Government has said that the current terrible state of the traffic situation in the state was temporary and Lagosians would soon get some relief.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by the Gbenga Omotoso, Commissioner for Information and Strategy on Wednesday, the Lagos government said it had noted the discomfort of Lagos commuters and motorists.</p>
      <p>Omotosho said that the government didn’t set out to inflict any pain on Lagosians with its road repair efforts and that it had called on the contractors to speed up work on the road.</p>
      <p>He said, “The Lagos State Government has noted the discomfort commuters and motorists have been experiencing since the beginning of the massive road repairs under ‘Operation 116’ across the State.</p>
      <p>“There is no deliberate action to cause Lagosians any pain; the present situation is temporary. The contractors are speeding up their jobs and they are being encouraged to work at night where possible, even as motorists are being advised to use alternative routes.</p>
      <p>“The administration sympathises with residents on the inconvenience suffered daily but in fulfilment of its commitment to making the roads motorable immediately the rains subside, resources and equipment have been deployed to fix degenerated roads. The discomfort will be short-lived.”</p>
      <p>Omotosho also revealed that relevant agencies have been directed to review traffic control and regulatory policies in a bid to find long term solution to the traffic situation.</p>
      <p>The commissioner also blamed the “daily influx of people” from other parts of the country into the state for the traffic situation. He, however, promised that work on the road would be completed before the Yuletide.</p>
