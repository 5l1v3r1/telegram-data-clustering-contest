      <p>The tenth position has been occupied by the Suzuki Access. It registered a sale of 53,552 units last month. It may be noted here that the Access wasn’t a part of the top 10 selling list of October 2018. While the Hero Glamour, which was on the tenth spot of the previous year’s list, has failed to make it to the last month’s list of best-selling 10 models.</p>
