      <h1>This 18-year-old beast is a ‘boy in a man’s body’ — and has a footy CV most AFL draftees would be jealous of</h1>

      <h3>Not many aspiring AFL draftees can say – or have ever said – they’ve made the Under 18 All-Australian team twice, been part of a national carnival championship team, captained a state side, played a full year of SANFL league footy and won a SANFL league premiership medallion.</h3>
      <p>But Will Gould can.</p>
      <p>A gun South Australian defensive prospect who was described by state coach Tony Bamford as a “boy in a man’s body”, Gould (192cm, 100kg) already has one of the great footy CVs – and that’s at the age of 18, well before he’s walked through the door of any AFL club.</p>

      <p>Which club he eventually joins remains an unknown at this stage. He could be a mid first-round pick, but could easily slide to the second round too.</p>
      <p>Yet of all the aforementioned achievements to date, the latter – the Glenelg premiership medallion – is clearly Gould’s proudest.</p>
      <p>Unlike the other star 2019 SA draft prospects, Gould played in Glenelg’s league team whenever he was available, managing 15 games as a defender. From Round 1 against Norwood – he had 24 disposals and 11 rebounds on debut – until deep into the SANFL finals series, Gould was a sincere team contributor.</p>
      <p>It’s why when the final siren sounded on grand final day, with Glenelg 28-point victors over Port Adelaide, Gould felt genuinely part of the achievement. None of it felt token at all.</p>

      <p>But for Gould, the achievement of the club – not just the team – superseded any sense of personal accomplishment, for it was the Tigers’ first SANFL flag in 33 years. Remarkably, the premiership came just three years after the club faced extinction and launched a ‘Save the Tigers’ campaign.</p>
      <p>Gould soaked it all in. And it was beautiful.</p>
      <p>“It was something I've never experienced before – and I probably won’t experience it for a long time, I think,” Gould tells <i>foxfooty.com.au</i>.</p>
      <p>“The final siren and the excitement in the rooms afterwards was awesome. But then going back to the Bay afterwards and seeing all the supporters and how much it meant to them and the ones that have been through the struggles for 33 years – yeah, they were pretty happy that night.</p>
      <p>“I thought it would mean a lot to everyone at the club and the supporters as well. But it wasn't until I actually got back to the Bay to see how many people were there, with people coming up to you in tears, giving you a hug and stuff like that.”</p>
      <p>When a club triumphs for the first time since 1986, the celebrations last much longer than one night.</p>
      <p>And 18-year-old Gould made sure he threw himself into the fun and frivolity.</p>

      <p>“They were pretty good,” Gould says of the celebrations with a cheeky laugh. “There were a few late nights.”</p>
      <p>Of all the significant post-flag moments for Gould, seeing his father Richard in the rooms was perhaps the most poignant.</p>
      <p>Richard Gould represented Glenelg at Under 17 and Under 19 level before he had to move to a farm located in state’s south-east. He would represent Robe then thrive at Lucindale, where he’d win the 1994 Mail medal for the league’s best and fairest player.</p>
      <p>“He could play a bit, the old man,” Will says with a smile.</p>
      <p>“He's a big softie too. He was trying to hold back the emotions in the rooms, but a lot of people in the rooms were pretty emotional. It was just great for him and my family … it was pretty special day.”</p>
      <p>Gould fondly remembers backyard kick-to-kick with his dad. It was there where Gould learnt and developed his now-outstanding kicking skills – albeit with a constant threat from Richard hanging over his head.</p>
      <p>“Dad made me drop the ball with one hand, so I'd have a wristband on this hand and he said ‘if you don't take the wristband hand off the ball, I'm going to cut it off,” Will says.</p>

      <p>“Fair to say it worked pretty quickly to drop the ball with one hand.”</p>
      <p>AFL talent ambassador Kevin Sheehan earlier this year described Gould as “Shannon Hurn all over again”, as he possesses a scary number of similar traits to West Coast premiership captain: A great right-foot kick, straight-ahead speed, strong rebound and intercept ability and, most notably, a solid build unlike other draftees.</p>
      <p>As a bottom-ager, Gould was part of the successful 2018 SA team – which included Connor Rozee, Jack Lukosius and Izak Rankine – that won the national championships. He impressed so much that he won All-Australian honours as a bottom-ager.</p>
      <p>He backed it up in 2019 as SA captain, winning All-Australian honours for the second straight year.</p>
      <p>Gould has played his best footy as a high half-back flanker – his favourite position to play. Offensively, he’s given whatever side he’s represented ample drive. Defensively, he’s handled key-position forwards well, but AFL clubs have told him he could “get a little bit better at playing on the smalls if I'm going to be playing up on a half-back flank”.</p>
      <p>Gould’s ‘boy in a man’s body’ approach was particularly evident in April when he represented the Australian academy against VFL side Casey Demons at the MCG.</p>

      <p>The Demons gained some early scoreboard ascendancy, but that didn’t hinder the confidence of Gould, who asserted his authority on the game with some big bumps and crunching tackles.</p>
      <p>“I think because I’d played some senior footy and no one else had really played against men, I tried to throw a bit of weight around early and lead from the front.</p>
      <p>“Playing a full year of league footy this year and playing against some AFL-listed boys gives me a bit of confidence that I can do it against the big boys.”</p>
      <p>Yet looks can be deceiving.</p>
      <p>Despite his physique, Gould admits he’s “a little kid on the inside”.</p>
      <p>“On the outside I might look big and scary, but I’m really a bit of a softie,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I love having fun. That’s what I think I’ve brought to the SA side a bit this year, like dressing up very first training in op shop tops, so got the boys having a bit of fun.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever you do, you’ve got to have fun.”</p>
