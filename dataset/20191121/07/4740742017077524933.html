      <h1>What it's like to be in a Bristol City team talk given by Lee Johnson</h1>
      <h2>Dressing room insight given by the Robins players.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City this week published some very revealing insight into the club and how the playing squad perceive the senior coaching team.</p>
      <p>The Robins players were tasked with giving impersonations of the coaching team delivering talks to the group. The results were highly amusing, with the club's Twitter feed showing senior members pretending to be Lee Johnson, Dean Holden and Jamie McAllister. See the videos below.</p>
      <p>If there was any worry that the impressions - with Ashley Williams' rendition of Holden, Bailey Wright's McAllister and Sam Szmodics' Johnson also proving very funny - could lead to repercussions, it was allayed in this week's press conference.</p>
      <p>"The gaffer came up with it on the way up to Barnsley it was, and what a great idea. It shows from a supporter's point of view a little bit behind the scenes, and there's a lot of time spent in hotels and it shows the team spirit we've got as well," <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-transcript-nottingham-forest-3555566">explained Holden earlier this week</a>.</p>

      <p>"We gave them extra points for going quite close to the bone because we thought it might be a bit boring, but Maenpaa on his knees pretending to be the manager, and Rodri carrying the water pretending to be Phil Tart, one of the guys behinds the scenes who carries crates and crates of water everywhere."</p>
      <p>Callum O'Dowda was another player to give a hilarious routine: the Irishman held a talk and several times referenced an expensive watch on his forearm, a watch that the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> head coach has worn many times and drawn attention to at times.</p>
      <p>Szmodics' turn involved pretending to be the head coach and referencing his 500 games as a player and 400 games as a manager.</p>

      <p>The sketches proved a fascinating illumination of how the coaching staff operate, talk and relay messages to the playing staff, with the City players having to perform different scenarios: from providing a half-time team talk when losing to conducting a post-match briefing.</p>
      <p>To add some more colour, specifically blue,<i> Bristol Live</i> can add that from our sources, we have heard how Lee Johnson is happy - like many football managers - to shout and swear to get his point across in team talks, including replacing Luke Williams in the dressing room at one U23s game this season to blast Niclas Eliasson along the lines of: "The fans are on my back wanting me to pick you but you've got to show me that you want it more..." While Famara Diedhiou has been on the end of a tongue lashing once or twice before in training too.</p>

      <p>Regarding the impersonations, it was not just replicating the staff. Other players were involved in doing impressions of their team-mates too, with Nathan Baker reprising the role of friend Tomas Kalas.</p>
      <p>"It was the little things in there," explained Holden further. "We were just chatting about it there, myself, Macca and the gaffer, that every time we come out of a team meeting, the players are obviously picking up on little things all the way through that we don't notice. It was brilliant, really, really good. It's good that you can laugh at yourself but I thought his accent was terrible!"</p>
      <p>The assistant head coach added this week that maybe next time it will be the senior coaching staff giving impersonations of the players.</p>
      <p>With the aim to loosen the inhibitions of the players and show that the players are well capable of making decisions themselves, the humility of the group shines through.</p>
      <p>The videos are likely the closest <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> supporters will get to being given a Lee Johnson team talk unless you play football for one of the local sides where Johnson has lent a hand to repay a charitable donation.</p>
      <p>And they are both laugh-inducing and interesting in equal measure, and highly recommended viewing.</p>
