        <b>On the occasion of World Television Day, we engaged in an exclusive chat with actor Ravi Dubey who spoke about the advent of TV, the changes he would like to see in the industry and finally, credited Ekta Kapoor for her immense contribution to the medium</b>
      </p>
      <p>On World Television Day 2019, we spoke to the talented actor Ravi Dubey who spoke about the importance of the TV medium in his life, his childhood days watching Television and the changes he would like to see happen in the industry.</p>
      <p>
        <b>One change you would like to bring in the Television industry?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The shift timings! As most of the film industry works in Mumbai and commuting here is not easy due to traffic woes. To add to it, working for 12 hours daily isn’t easy. We earn for a living and according to me, a work day shouldn’t extend beyond 8 hours and if you include travelling, it should come around 10; so that you can spend time with your family too.</p>

        <b>What does the word Television mean to you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Television has been the backbone of my life in several ways. It has given me tremendous financial assurance. Most importantly, TV has given me global recognition. So, I will always be indebted to Indian Television.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you think TV helps promote peace in the society or it causes disturbance at times? </b>
      </p>
      <p>Everything has two sides but I would like to see the positive aspect. I read a quote somewhere that says ‘I am an optimist because there is no use of being anything else.’ So I think television has some fantastic potential. It gives you a pedestal where your voice can be heard. One thing I would like to advice those are working to achieve this pedestal are please be responsible with the message you are sending across. People are following suit. They will absorb what you say. They will replicate what you do. If you want to be a hero, be the right kind of a hero. That’s one minor suggestion I would like to give to our audience. And that's one thing me and Sargun categorically like to follow in our lives. So that it can promote peace, prosperity, respect and regard for elders.</p>

        <b>So you mean to say only a disclaimer doesn't work?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, only a disclaimer doesn't work as you need to have some kind of responsibility as millions of people are watching you. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tell us about the first show that you watched on TV?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When I was a child I used to watch a lot of content, right from Malgudi Days to Tara. But the one show and character which I wanted to essay was Byomkesh Bakshi. It's still on my wish-list.</p>

      <p><b>As a child, what impact did Television have on your mind?<br/></b>TV had a beautiful impact on me as there was no one in my life who belonged to this industry; my father is a civil engineer whereas my mother is a Hindi Sanskrit teacher. Door door tak industry se koi association tha bhi nahi and lagta bhi nahi tha kabhi hoga. Still, my first and last dream was always to become an actor.</p>

      <p><b>Lastly, Television is a medium which is being watched by all kinds of audience around the world. What message do you have for them?<br/></b>TV is such a huge medium and all thanks to the people who are trusting the medium and investing in it. Despite the advent of OTT platform, Television has its own loyal audience. Consistently, the audience is adding in. We belong to a country where emotional vibe is always on priority and that's why daily soaps go on for years. In a country like India, TV has a very long way to go.<br/><br/><b>Who do you think has contributed immensely towards the advent of Indian Television? </b><br/>Many great producers should be thanked for it. For instance, Ekta Kapoor walked in to the industry and changed the whole scene. Today, if all of us can boast about being good TV actors, then Ekta should also earn credit for it. And just like her, several other producers have also contributed in a big way to the medium.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- variety, instagram/ektaravikapoor/ravidubey2312</i></p>
