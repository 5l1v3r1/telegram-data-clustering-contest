      <p>Here were the highlights of Wednesday night’s I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <h3>Adele Roberts retching over eating a pig’s uterus</h3>
      <p>Adele Roberts came close to being sick as she took on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-adele-roberts-retches-eating-pig-uterus-disgusting-bushtucker-trial-11187585/">first food-related Bushtucker Trial of the series.</a></p>
      <p>After having us all in stitches over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/">her framed photo of Jane McDonald</a>, the Radio 1 presenter had us in fits of laughter as she went up against Roman Kemp in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-a-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-uses-the-spirit-of-jane-mcdonald-to-wolf-down-camel-anus-and-vomit-fruit-in-foul-bushtucker-trial-11190226/">challenge named Just Desserts</a>.</p>

      <p>Adele was first to take on the pig’s uterus aka piggy pudding – which she compared to the Demogorgon monster from the Netflix phenomenon Stranger Things.</p>
      <p>Roman tried to help his fellow contestant through it and spouted some encouraging words of wisdom, saying: ‘Don’t worry about it. Swallow the juices, focus on the chew.</p>
      <p>‘Think how proud Jane is going to be!’</p>
      <p>The Capital FM DJ couldn’t help but throwing one of his impressions in there as he mimicked the cruise-ship singer to try and take poor Adele’s mind off what she was trying to eat.</p>

      <h3>Caitlyn Jenner opens up about being treated differently as a woman: ‘This girl thing is working out pretty good’</h3>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/04/11/caitlyn-jenner-liberated-after-gender-reassignment-surgery-and-admits-she-was-tired-of-tucking-it-in-all-the-time-6566938/">who had gender reassignment surgery in 2017</a> appeared on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/caitlyn-jenner-appeared-im-celebrity-us-despite-claiming-doesnt-know-show-works-11076568/">American version of the show back in 2003 as Bruce</a>, and she said as a woman, she is treated differently as she exclaimed ‘this girl thing is working out pretty good’.</p>
      <p>Comparing her time as Bruce Jenner on the American show, Caitlyn explained how she ‘did everything for everyone’ but on the UK show, her campmates are always offering to make her cups of tea.</p>
      <p>‘As Bruce I was doing everything for everyone, but here everyone is offering to make me tea.</p>
      <p>‘This girl thing is working out pretty good’.</p>

      <p>Years before she transitioned, Caitlyn appeared on the US show alongside the likes of entertainment reporter Robin Leach and actress Melissa Rivers.</p>
      <p>At the time, Bruce got to the final week of the series but didn’t make it to the last three.</p>
      <p>J Lo’s ex-husband Cris Judd ended up winning the spin-off, beating Joan Rivers’ daughter Melissa and radio presenter John Melendez.</p>
      <h3>I’m A Celebrity’s Jacqueline Jossa grills Nadine Coyle over Girls Aloud beef with Cheryl</h3>
      <p>As the duo were chatting, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-grills-nadine-coyle-girls-aloud-beef-cheryl-brands-fake-news-11191860/">Jacqueline couldn’t help but ask Nadine about her time in the girl band</a> and questioned whether they were put together like Little Mix were on The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>.</p>
      <p>Nadine explained: ‘Really good, really good, I liked being in a girl band. I am one of three sisters and went to an all-girls grammar school so I’m used to being around girls.’</p>

        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nadine-cf24.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C339&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>Nadine said her feud with Cheryl was ‘fake news’ (Picture: ITV)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She continued: ‘The public had voted, it was ITV’s Popstars the Rivals so a girl band and a boy band and the public put us together.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Jacqueline then decided to go one step further by grilling the singer on her alleged feud with Cheryl.</p>
      <p>‘I’d heard you didn’t get on with Cheryl,’ Jacqueline continued.</p>
      <p>Nadine simply responded ‘Fake news’.</p>
      <h3>Ian Wright and Andrew Maxwell clash over crocodile feet</h3>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andrew-maxwell/">Andrew Maxwell</a> had a little disagreement over a crocodile foot (which looked like a chicken wing), as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts and Roman Kemp won the camp a luxury meal for collecting 10 stars during the bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>‘Everyone is a bit cautious on how they think their food should be cooked, if it was on the outside world I may get annoyed but you can’t in here,’ Myles Stephenson began.</p>
      <p>But as the camp tucked into their meal, they all had something to say about it.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a bit like chicken-fish,’ Adele Roberts described.</p>

        <figcaption>Oh dear! (Picture: ITV)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While Jacqueline Jossa added: ‘It was a mixture between pork and chicken but just quite hard and tough.’</p>
      <p>It was when Jacqueline offered Ian an extra bit of ‘chicken’ when things got a bit heated.</p>
      <p>‘Ian everyone has had some there’s two there, go,’ Andrew added.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘Come on seriously Ian.’</p>
      <p>The former footballer calmly responded: ‘I honestly don’t want no more.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It was when Andrew exclaimed: ‘Jesus the drama’ when Ian got a bit snappy (see what I did there) as he raged: ‘I said I don’t want no more f***ing crocodile.’</p>
