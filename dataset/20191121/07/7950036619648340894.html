      <p>Zimbabwean police on Wednesday used batons, teargas and water cannons to disperse Movement for Democratic Change Alliance (MDC) supporters.</p>
      <p>They had gathered outside its building in Harare for a speech by leader Nelson Chamisa.</p>
      <p>But their singing was soon stifled, as police moved in, using batons to disperse supporters.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of police blocked roads leading to the party's headquarters.</p>
      <p>Footage captured by Reuters showed security personnel charging the crowd, hitting men and women.</p>
      <p>Police declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Political tension is rising in Zimbabwe, where the population is grappling with a severe economic crisis.</p>
      <p>It has seen rolling power cuts lasting up to 18 hours a day and shortages of foreign currency, fuel and medicines.</p>
      <p>This latest police action comes as the opposition accuses President Emmerson Mnangagwa of adopting heavy-handed tactics, like his predecessor, the late Robert Mugabe.</p>
      <p>The president has defended himself, saying his administration is opening up political and media space.</p>
      <p>However, just this year, police banned several opposition gatherings, saying they feared the events would turn violent.</p>
      <p>Critics of President Mnangagwa say he has failed to keep promises on economic reforms, attracting foreign investment and rebuilding collapsing infrastructure.</p>
