      <h1>Dog The Bounty Hunter Proves He’s ‘Alive’ By Holding Up Newspaper And Sign After Fans Express Concerns Over His Health</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:56:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:56</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Markus</a></address>
      <p>Fans have been worried about Dog the Bounty Hunter’s wellbeing to the point that he decided to just take a pic with the newspaper reading that day’s date to prove he’s not dead! Duane was also holding a piece of paper on which it was written ‘I’m Alive’ in case it was not clear enough.</p>
      <p>This post comes after rumors started going around that he suffered another pulmonary embolism.</p>
      <p>After losing his wife, Beth Chapman to throat cancer last summer, Duane hasn’t been doing well, be it emotionally or physically.</p>
      <p>Since the man’s health hasn’t been the best either, fans have been worried he was in the hospital after suffering a second pulmonary embolism.</p>
      <p>But Duane made sure everyone knew he was alive and well by sharing that pic.</p>
      <p>Not only is he Okay but Dog was apparently heading out for a workout when he took that photo which proves he is determined to stay healthy and in shape.</p>
      <p>Seeing that so many people on his platform expressed concern over his state, Dog thought it was a better idea to put those to rest by showing them he was doing fine, rather than just telling them that.</p>
      <p>Back in September, he was admitted to the hospital for what was thought to be a ‘heart emergency,’ initially.</p>
      <p>However, it turned out to be a pulmonary embolism, which meant that one or more of his arteries in his lungs were blocked by clots.</p>
      <p>This sort of condition can be deadly but Duane was lucky enough to receive the help he needed in due time.</p>
