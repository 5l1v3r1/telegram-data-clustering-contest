      <h1>Ann Coulter event at UC Berkeley draws masked protesters; multiple arrests reported</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:32:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:32</time> by <a rel="author">Brie Stimson</a></address>
      <p>An appearance by conservative writer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-attacks-wacky-nut-job-ann-coulter-over-twitter-for-criticism-of-border-wall-progress">Ann Coulter</a> at the University of California at Berkeley drew a crowd of protesters Wednesday night, in the latest episode of "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment">cancel culture</a>" on the nation's college campuses.</p>
      <p>Campus police said on Twitter that "multiple" mask-wearing protesters were arrested.</p>
      <p>Covering faces is a violation of campus protest policy, the Bay Area's FOX 2 reported. The station said as many as seven people were arrested.</p>

      <p>Video posted online showed Coulter being quickly escorted past protesters into the building where the event, titled “Adios, America,” was held. It was hosted by the Berkeley campus' College Republicans.</p>

      <p>Coulter started speaking about 15 minutes late because attendees had trouble getting through a “human chain” of protesters who tried to block ticketholders from getting inside the building.</p>

      <p>“They can protest all they want and shout their slogans – free speech – I’m cool with that, but I am not cool with having somebody block our way getting in,” said Derrick Main, a Marin County Republican Central Committee member. He told FOX 2 he paid $45 for his ticket.</p>

      <p>Conservative writer Andy Ngo posted video that appeared to show a woman having her ticket stolen.</p>

      <p>Some of the protesters said they were there to promote left-wing causes.</p>
      <p>“We’re here to show our support for DACA and also to protest white supremacy,” Hamid Hakimi, a student protester, told <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2019/11/20/uc-police-report-several-arrests-on-campus-related-to-ann-coulter-protests">Berkeleyside</a>.</p>

      <p>Some protesters said they wanted to see the event shut down, but others agreed Coulter had a right to speak.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s important that we hear people like her speak to know that this is real,” a student named Aurora told FOX 2.</p>

      <p>“What we’re doing by protesting is showing that her specific speech is not welcome here,” student Gianluca Pedrani told the station.</p>

      <p>There were two protesters inside the event, but only one was removed because the other agreed to be silent, <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/video/627720">FOX 2</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The Berkeley campus is frequently the center for free speech debates. In September 2017, a scheduled four-day event dubbed Free Speech Week was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/milo-yiannopoulos-holds-small-berkeley-rally-after-free-speech-week-nixed">canceled over safety concerns</a>. Protesters had sought to silence a featured speaker, provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.</p>
      <p>Earlier that year, Coulter <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ann-coulter-cancels-berkeley-event-amid-protests-says-decision-a-dark-day-for-free-speech-in-america">canceled an event on the campus</a>, also over safety concerns. She called the situation "a dark day for free speech in America."</p>
