      <p>I'm A Celebrity viewers noticed Dec Donnelly sporting a slight injury in the latest episode of the ITV jungle series.</p>
      <p>Some fans even aired their "worry" for Ant McPartlin's co-host on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , with him confessing he was a little "accident prone" at the moment.</p>
      <p>As Ant and Dec returned for the latest episode, eagle-eyed fans quickly spotted a plaster around one of Dec's fingers.</p>
      <p>While the tiny injury wasn't addressed, fans assumed he'd suffered a cut and wondered what had happened.</p>
      <p>Just days ago Dec addressed a separate injury after fans spotted marks on his arm.</p>

      <p>This time around, Dec did respond to concern with a light-hearted tweet but didn't explain the need for the plaster.</p>
      <p>A fan tweeted to the duo's account: "Dec mate stop with the injuries please, first the burnt arm now you’ve cut your finger?? We worry!!!!"</p>
      <p>Several other fans liked the comment and shared their own concern.</p>

      <p>Dec wrote: “Nothing exciting unfortunately. I scalded myself while sterilising Isla’s dummies!”</p>
      <p>Fans then responded to the news to warn Dec of the hazards of being a father.</p>
      <p>“Oh Dec, life of a dad,” one follower replied - along with a couple of crying-with-laughter emojis.</p>
      <p>“Bless ya Dec you’re a good dad for Isla,” commented another.</p>
