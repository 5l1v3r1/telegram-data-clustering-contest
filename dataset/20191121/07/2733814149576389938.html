      <h1>Google Is Terminating Google Cloud Print</h1>

      <p>Google has <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006">announced</a> that Cloud Print, its cloud-based printing solution, <a href="https://ww.9to5google.com/2019/11/21/google-cloud-print-dead-2020/">is being retired at the end of next year</a>. 9to5Google reports: <i>The announcement comes in the form of a support document for Cloud Print that popped up recently, which is kind enough to remind us that Cloud Print has technically been in beta since it launched a decade ago: "Cloud Print, Google's cloud-based printing solution that has been in beta since 2010, will no longer be supported as of December 31, 2020. Beginning January 1, 2021, devices across all operating systems will no longer be able to print using Google Cloud Print. We recommend that over the next year, you identify an alternative solution and execute a migration strategy." <br/><br/>Google notes that Chrome OS' <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome-enterprise/chrome-enterprise-now-offers-native-print-management/">native printing solutions</a> have been vastly improved since Cloud Print launched in 2010, and also promises that native printing in Chrome OS will continue to get more features over time: "Google has improved the native printing experience for Chrome OS, and will continue adding features to native printing. For environments besides Chrome OS, or in multi-OS scenarios, we encourage you to use the respective platform's native printing infrastructure and/or partner with a print solutions provider."</i></p>
