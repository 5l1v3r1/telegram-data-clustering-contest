      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:17:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:17</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kajol">Kajol</a> undoubtedly remains one of the most loved on screen jodis we have in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a>. The duo has weaved magic on the silver screen with their chemistry in many films. And it also includes the film ‘Dupilicate’! Mahesh Bhatt’s ‘Duplicate’ is still one of the most loved films of the all Shah Rukh Khan fans out there. The Baadshah Of Bollywood played dual role of both protagonist and antagonist in the movie.</p>
      <p>The climax scene of the movie where <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Farida-Jalal">Farida Jalal</a>, who played the role of good SRK’s mother asks both SRKs to pull one arm each so that she can recognise the bad SRK. While this scene still remains one of the most memorable scenes in the film, did you know that the scene also had Kajol in it?</p>
      <p>Yes, you read it right! Remember the scene when Shah Rukh goes to drop Farida Jalal at the station? He is seen quite upset that she is leaving. He is then seen asking Kajol, who is walking past him, ‘Behenji aap mujhse shaadi karogi?’ And Kajol’s reply to that had left all of us in splits!</p>
      <p>Although the film received mixed response, SRK’s portrayal of negative character garnered much appreciation.</p>
      <p>The movie also starred <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Juhi-Chawla">Juhi Chawla</a> and Sonali Bedre in the lead roles.</p>
