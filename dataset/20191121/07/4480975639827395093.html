      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">GBP/USD</a> has been gradually recovering from the downfall it suffered after the televised debate between the leaders of Britain's largest parties. How is cable positioned on the charts? </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">Technical Confluences Indicator</a> is showing that pound/dollar enjoys significant support at <b>1.2919</b>, which is the convergence of the Fibonacci 61.8% one-day, the Simple Moving Average 100-15m, the SMA 5-4h, the SMA 5-4h, the SMA 10-4h, and the Bollinger Band 1h-Middle.</p>
      <p>Further down, another considerable cushion awaits at <b>1.2871</b>, which is the meeting point of the Fibonacci 38.2% one-week and the Pivot Point one-day Support 2. </p>
      <p>Looking up, some resistance awaits at <b>1.2960</b>, which is the confluence of the Fibonacci 161.8% one-day, the Bollinger Band one-day Upper, the PP one-week R1 and the PP 1d-R2. </p>
      <p>Further above, sterling may target <b>1.3013</b>, which is where the six-month high and the PP 1w-R2 meet the price. </p>
      <p>
        <b>All in all, the path of least resistance is to the upside. </b>
      </p>
      <p>This is how it looks on the tool:</p>

      <h3>Confluence Detector</h3>
      <p>The Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a <b>congestion of indicators,</b> moving averages, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci levels</a>, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.</p>
      <p>This tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. This means that one <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin">price level without any indicator</a> or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.</p>
