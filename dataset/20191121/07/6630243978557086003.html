      <h1>Tigray bloc rejects 'unlawful' merger of Ethiopia ruling coalition</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:45:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author">Abdur Rahman Alfa Shaban</a></address>
      <p>The Tigray Peoples Liberation Front, TPLF, has rejected efforts by Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to dissolve the currently four-member ruling coalition, the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front, EPRDF.</p>
      <p>TPLF’s representatives voted against the merger during an Executive Committee meeting held last weekend. The motion, however, passed by 30 votes for and six against.</p>
      <p>The EPRDF’s Council, a 180-member body – it’s highest authority – is expected to vote on finalizing the merger plans today (November 21).</p>
      <p>In a letter sent to the EPRDF secretariat after a meeting of the TPLF’s Central Committee in the regional capital Mekelle, the party cited what it said were procedural and legal shortfalls in its opposition.</p>
      <p>They also declined today’s meeting of the EPRDF Council. The party like the three other blocs were expected to present a quarter of votes, that is 45 members. The other three parties also present the same number.</p>
      <p>“In its planned meeting today, EPRDF’s Council is expected to discuss and possibly approve three major agendas: EPRDF’s merger, Prosperity Party (PP) manifesto, and Prosperity Party’s bylaw.</p>
      <p>“These were the three major agendas approved by majority members of EPRDF’s 36 member Executive Committee (EC) during the three days meeting over the last weekend,” <a href="https://addisstandard.com/news-tplf-cites-legal-procedural-shortfalls-to-decline-merger/">the privately-run Addis Standard said in its report.</a></p>
      <p>The other members of the current EPRDF coalition are Oromo Democratic Party (ODP, the Amhara Democratic Party (ADP) and the Southern Ethiopian Peoples Democratic Party (SEPDM).</p>
      <p>The coalition also has five associate parties that belong in the other semi-autonomous regions of Africa’s second most populous nation. National elections are due in May 2020 despite calls for a postponement citing insecurity.</p>
