      <p>But how is it done? <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/how-make-facebook-cartoon-family-17286080">MEN tells us more.</a></p>
      <p>The site being used actually started off as somewhere to design personalised Christmas mugs.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mademine.com/products/christmas-best-friends-coffee-mugs">MadeMine site</a> allows people to select the number of people and pets in their family, add their names and even choose their hair colour to make it a true likeness - people have been sharing their finished creation on Facebook which has helped spread its popularity.</p>
      <p>Various backdrops are available, though the Christmas tree one does look to be most popular.</p>
