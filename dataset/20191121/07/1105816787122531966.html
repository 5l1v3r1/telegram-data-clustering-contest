      <h1>Pro-Brexit UK candidate harassed anti-Brexit opponent: court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:05:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>LONDON: </b>A pro-Brexit candidate was on Wednesday found guilty of harassing a prominent “remain” figure after a court in London heard she followed her to parliament and called her a traitor.</p>
      <p>Westminster Magistrates Court was told Amy Dalla Mura, 56, targeted Anna Soubry between January and March, on one occasion forcing her to abandon a public speaking engagement.</p>
      <p>Mura is standing for the far-right English Democrats against Soubry, a former Conservative MP who is seeking re-election as an independent in the Broxtowe constituency in central England.</p>
      <p>Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot described the defendant’s behaviour as “oppressive and unacceptable”, assessing that she was “driven by anger at Ms Soubry’s political views on Brexit”.</p>

      <p>She said she was satisfied with Mura’s verbal abuse, including one occasion when she called Soubry a traitor as she was giving a television interview inside parliament, was harassment.</p>
      <p>The judge granted Mura bail pending the completion of psychiatric reports and ordered her to reappear for sentencing on December 16 – four days after the general election.</p>
      <p>As a condition of her bail, the judge banned her from campaigning in person in Broxtowe and ordered her not to mention Soubry by name as she canvassed for votes.</p>
      <p>Last week, a man who sent a death threat to Soubry was jailed for one year after warning Soubry she would suffer the same fate as Jo Cox, an opposition Labour party lawmaker who was murdered by a neo-Nazi days before the 2016 EU referendum.</p>
      <p>More than three years on, and with parliament yet to fully endorse Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s exit terms, opinion has polarised, with MPs facing a barrage of abuse.</p>

      <p>A police unit set up after Cox’s murder said it was probing increasing levels of abuse, threats and intimidation against MPs, their staff or families.</p>
      <p>Safety warnings for the campaign have been issued to candidates.</p>
      <p>Adrian Usher, of the Metropolitan Police’s Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team, arrested and charged Mura, who pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>He said: “Strong political opinions are no excuse for abuse, harassment or intimidation of members of the public or parliamentarians.</p>
      <p>“Police will treat such allegations seriously and seek to bring offenders to justice – as today’s conviction demonstrates.”</p>
