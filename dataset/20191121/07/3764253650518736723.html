      <p>The Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS) directed by President Muhammadu Buhari has been described by the chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in the University of Ibadan, Professor Deji Omole, as dictatorial.</p>
      <p>Omole said that the order that members of ASUU should move to campuses so as to begin enrolment in the IPPIS is a mindless disregard for the law on the part of the federal government in a democratic setting as Nigeria.</p>

      <p>Omole said: <i>“The government’s pronouncement to forcefully enrol university workers is an act of violence against the university system. It is worrisome for a government under democratic dispensation to resort to force rather than dialogue.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Let the government come back to negotiation’s table and let’s discuss the grey areas. Forceful enlistment will not solve the problem."</i>
