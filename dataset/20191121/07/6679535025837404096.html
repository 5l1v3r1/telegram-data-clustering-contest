      <h1>Pragya’s appointment to parliamentary committee on defence unfortunate for the country: Congress</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:40:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:40</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Congress on Thursday slammed the government<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-mp-pragya-thakur-nominated-to-parliamentary-consultative-committee-on-defence/article30035659.ece"> over the appointment of controversial BJP leader Pragya Thakur</a> to a crucial Parliamentary Consultative Committee on Defence and said it was “unfortunate for the country”.</p>
      <p>According to a bulletin issued by the Lok Sabha Secretariat, Thakur will be part of the 21-member committee headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.</p>
      <p>“It is unfortunate for the country that an MP accused of spreading terror has been nominated as member of a defence-related committee. Modi ‘has not been able to forgive her from the heart’ but she has been given the responsibility of important issues such as the country’s defence.</p>
      <p>“That is why if there is Modi, anything is possible,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi.</p>
