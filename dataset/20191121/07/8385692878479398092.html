      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Best Buy</a> is holding its "Beat the Rush" pre-Black Friday sale right now, and allowing you to get Black Friday prices now on a ton of products including this Sony X800G TV.</p>
      <p>This is a 55-inch Sony X800G 4K Android TV that would normally go for $799. Today, it is available for $499 thanks to this sale. And that brings it down to an all-time low.</p>
      <p>This TV from Sony is a really great one to pick up for a number of reasons. Firstly, it does run on Android TV. This allows you to watch all of your favorite movies and TV shows on your TV. Thanks to it supporting apps like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video and much more.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It also has support for both Amazon Alexa and <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/google-assistant-can-now-deliver-a-curated-playlist-of-audio-news.html">Google Assistant</a>. Allowing you to use whichever assistant you'd prefer. And you can control your smart home products from the TV using your voice.</p>
      <p>Sony has outfitted this TV with an LED panel instead of an OLED, hence the much lower price tag. It's going to be great for well-lit rooms, but the colors won't be as great as an OLED TV might be. The blacks are more of a dark gray, mostly due to the backlight that is needed for a panel like this. But the colors are still pretty impressive. Thanks to Sony's 4K X-Reality PRO technology, which is able to make these colors vibrant, and support HDR even if the content does not.</p>
      <p>Speaking of HDR, this TV does support all of the HDR standards. That includes HDR10, HLG and much more. So no matter what standard you need to use, you're covered here.</p>
