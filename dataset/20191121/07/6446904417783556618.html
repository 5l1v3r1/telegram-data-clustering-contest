      <h1>Johnson &amp; Johnson found 'negligent' in pelvic mesh lawsuit in Australia</h1>
      <h2>Lawyers for the women said the devices caused “incontinence, infection and chronic pain”.</h2>

      <p>AN AUSTRALIAN COURT has found that Johnson &amp; Johnson was “negligent” in supplying thousands of women pelvic meshes without adequate testing or health warnings, a ruling that exposes the firm to millions of dollars in damages.</p>
      <p>Federal Court Justice Anna Katzmann upheld a class action from more than 1,000 Australian women who say the mesh – designed to support weakened muscles holding up the pelvic organs – had disastrous side-effects.</p>
      <p>The amount of damages will be set in next year, but the ruling said three companies in the Johnson &amp; Johnson group rushed to get the sub-standard products to market without adequate testing, while vastly underplaying potential dangers.</p>
      <p>“The risks were known, not insignificant, and on the respondents’ own admission, could cause significant and serious harm” the judge said.</p>
      <p>“A far more cautious approach was warranted.”</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the women said the devices caused “incontinence, infection and chronic pain” among a litany of problems.</p>
      <p>“It has been a long journey towards justice for the many women whose lives were destroyed by the defective pelvic mesh and incontinence tape implants.” said Rebecca Jancauskas, special counsel for Shine Lawyers – which helped bring the class action.</p>
      <p>The ruling is just one in a series to hit mesh manufacturers worldwide. Tens of thousands of lawsuits have been lodged in the United States alone.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed to pay $117 million (€105.6 million) to settle some US claims over their vaginal mesh products.</p>
