        <b>Gaborone,</b>
      </p>
      <p>Botswana's national airline has unveiled plans to cut more than half of its staff as part of a restructuring plan that would transfer ground handling operations to a new company.</p>
      <p>The southern African country's carrier owns three aircrafts serving domestic and regional routes.</p>
      <p>It has been running at a loss for more than a decade, mainly because of high maintenance costs for its planes.</p>
      <p>The government has already tried to sell the airline, without success.</p>

      <p>"In terms of the numbers of restructuring ... we have a staff complement of about 450 staff members and the intention is to have about 210 staff members", said Air Botswana director Agnes Khunwana at a media briefing on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The announced retrenchment stems from plans to eliminate the carrier's ground-handling operations, which are to be provided by a private company that has yet to be established.</p>
      <p>"In an effort to unlock value and aid profitability, the airline has taken the first step towards unbundling its operations by forming a ground handling company," said Khunwana in a statement before the briefing.</p>
      <p>She added that most of the laid off workers would be hired by the new company.</p>
