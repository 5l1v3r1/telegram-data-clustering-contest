      <h1>Soper 'happy to be back' after long break</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/Adrian%20Seconi" target="_blank">Adrian Seconi</a></address>
      <p>Blair Soper was not sure if he would ever be fit enough to play cricket at the top level again.</p>
      <p>The Otago left-armer has been named in the 12 for the one-dayer against Wellington in Queenstown today.</p>
      <p>It will be his maiden list A game and first game for Otago in more than three years.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old emerged around the same time as Otago captain Jacob Duffy (2012) and has played 11 first-class games.</p>
      <p>But Soper suffered a shoulder injury in 2014 which required surgery. That put him out of the game for a period of time and the opportunities at the next level dried up.</p>
      <p>He returned in 2016 but only managed 7.3 overs before picking up an injury.</p>
      <p>Soper plugged away for champion club side Green Island and remained on the fringe of the Volts. But an injury to Michael Rae has provided him with a lifeline.</p>
      <p>''I'm happy to be back,'' he said.</p>
      <p>''I wasn't sure I was going to get my body back up to shape but it is hanging in,'' the diesel mechanic said.</p>
      <p>Soper's ability to shape the new ball both ways enabled him to get the nod ahead of the likes of Travis Muller and Tommy Clout.</p>
      <p>''That is pretty much the message for me. I've just got to keep doing what I've been doing.</p>
      <p>''We've only just got on to grass in club cricket now. I sort of struggle on artificials a bit because I don't want to run in and hurt myself.</p>
      <p>''But we've had a couple of weeks and I'm warming into it.''</p>
      <p>Soper is one of two changes to the side which scored a 28-run DLS-method win against Northern Districts in Hamilton on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Neil Broom returns from a forearm issue and replaces back-up keeper Max Chu.</p>
      <p>Broom is the all-time Otago leading scorer in the format and his presence will significantly bolster the top order.</p>
      <p>He will join the likes of Nick Kelly, who scored a century on debut for Otago, and Dean Foxcroft who is rated highly.</p>
      <p>Wellington's Rachin Ravindra (19) will make his one-day debut. He is rated highly by New Zealand cricket and was called up to the New Zealand A squad before playing a domestic match for the Firebirds last season.</p>
      <p>Ravindra's inclusion is one of two changes made to the squad by Firebirds head coach Glenn Pocknall.</p>
      <p>Ravindra replaces Jakob Bhula at the top of the order and Jimmy Neesham returns from New Zealand A duty at the expense of fast bowler Ben Sears.</p>
      <p>The game is a rematch of last season's final which Wellington won. The defending champion started the campaign with a four-wicket loss to Auckland.</p>
