      <p>British Airways flights were facing delays in and out of London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports on November 21 after a technical glitch overnight, the airline said. "Our teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue which is affecting some of our flights," said a spokeswoman for BA, owned by airlines group IAG.</p>
      <p>"We have rebooked customers on to alternative flights and offered hotel accommodation where they have been unable to continue their journeys last night.</p>
      <p>"We are very sorry for the disruption to their travel plans. We plan to operate a full flight schedule today," she added.</p>
      <p>BA warned that there would be knock-on delays -- but declined to comment on the nature of the problem nor the number of flights affected.</p>
      <p>"This is the latest in a long line of British Airways technical glitches causing delays and cancellations," said Rory Boland, editor of consumer magazine Which? Travel.</p>
      <p>"Yet again it's thousands of passengers who are paying the price -- left tired, frustrated and with a lack of information and assistance from the airline."</p>
      <p>BA suffered a computer glitch in 2016 that severely affected its global check-in system.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile only two months ago, the airline was forced to ground its entire UK fleet for two days when pilots went on strike in a bitter and long-running pay dispute.</p>
