        <b>Human rights organisation Amnesty International has found in a study that the «surveillance-based business model» of Facebook and Google’s is incompatible with the right to privacy. The U.S. companies disagree.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/facebook-google-business-models-a-threat-to-human-rights-amnesty-report/a-51342506">German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle</a> reports on Thursday, November 21, that Amnesty International in a report has said tech giants Facebook and Google should be forced to abandon what it calls a «surveillance-based business model» that is «predicated on human rights abuse.»</p>
      <p>«Despite the real value of the services they provide, Google and Facebook’s platforms come at a systemic cost,» the human rights group said in its <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol30/1404/2019/en/">60-page report</a> this week.</p>
      <p>Amnesty believes that by gathering up personal data to feed advertising businesses, the two firms carry out an unprecedented assault on privacy rights.</p>
      <p>Amnesty said that by gathering up personal data to feed advertising businesses, the two firms carry out an unprecedented assault on privacy rights.</p>
      <p>
        <b>U.S. firms disagree</b>
      </p>
      <p>Facebook disagreed with the report’s findings. Steve Satterfield, the company’s public policy director, rejected the notion that the business model was «surveillance-based» and noted that users sign up voluntarily for the service.</p>
      <p>Google also disputed Amnesty’s findings, DW reports.</p>
