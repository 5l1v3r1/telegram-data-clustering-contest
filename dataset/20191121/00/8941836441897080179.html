      <p>MADRID (AP) - Novak Djokovic defeated Benoit Paire 6-3, 6-3 to seal Serbia’s victory over top-ranked France in the Davis Cup Finals on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The result gave Serbia an insurmountable 2-0 lead over the French before the doubles match. Filip Krajinovic had defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-5, 7-6 (5) in the first singles to mathematically secure Serbia in the last eight of the revamped team competition.</p>
      <p>Djokovic had a break in the first set and two in the second to clinch his 14th straight Davis Cup singles victory.</p>
      <p>“I made some crucial breaks at the right time in both sets,” Djokovic said. “It’s tough to play Benoit, he is a very talented guy, very unpredictable.”</p>
      <p>Serbia secured first place in Group A by winning every tie without dropping a set.</p>
