      <p>Gearing up for the release of their new album, <i>Everyday Life</i>, tomorrow, British band Coldplay announced they’ll be stepping back from touring the new record until able to find a way to take on shows that "have a positive impact" on the environment.Frontman Chris Martin spoke to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">BBC</a> about the band's decision: "We're taking time over the next year or two to work out how our tour can not only be sustainable [but] how it can be actively beneficial. The hardest thing is the flying side of things. But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no single use plastic, to have it largely solar powered. We've done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it's no so much taking as giving?"</p>
      <p>To accompany their new release, the band will play just two shows in Jordan ("we wanted to pick somewhere in the middle of the world where we normally don't get to play") that will be broadcast for free to the global public on YouTube. Both gigs will take place in Amman tomorrow, one at sunrise and the other at sunset, as an homage to the two "sides" of their album.</p>
      <p>Coldplay will also perform a one-off concert on November 25 at the Natural History Museum in London and donate all proceeds to an environmental charity.</p>
      <p>While talking to the British news station, Martin also revealed that the album's first single, "Champion of the World," was inspired by the BBC's own reports about a gardener dealing with violence in Afghanistan and a story about leprosy told by a Nigerian composer.</p>
      <p>The band's last world tour took place in 2016 and 2017 and included 122 shows played across five continents.</p>
