      <p>The representative body for corporate interests in greater Sydney has hit out at the NSW Independent Planning Commission's rejection of a 66-storey luxury Pyrmont hotel, labelling the body "out of touch".</p>
      <p>The commission on Wednesday found the benefits of The Star's 237m Ritz-Carlton tower plans did not outweigh the impacts, as it would prove "overly obtrusive" and inconsistent with NSW planning regulations.</p>
      <p>The commission said the new tower would "result in unacceptable visual impacts due to its scale, isolation and visual dominance" in the Pyrmont area.</p>
      <p>The application was referred to the IPC after the NSW planning department rejected The Star's multi-million dollar plan in July.</p>
      <p>The Sydney Business Chamber on Thursday said the decision should "spell the demise" of the IPC's authority over major Sydney projects, and again called for changes to the state's planning regulations.</p>
      <p>"The IPC's outright rejection of The Star's hotel in Pyrmont shows that it's sadly out of touch with Sydney's place as the nation's global city and it's time to rethink the slow and inefficient planning process," Sydney Business Chamber executive director Katherine O'Regan said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The state government on Wednesday said the "door's not closed" on a new hotel and apartment tower in the inner-city precinct, which it hopes will become Sydney's next entertainment and innovation hub.</p>
      <p>The government had previously expressed interest in amending planning controls around Pyrmont to enable large projects, and the Greater Sydney Commission in October found the area's planning controls had "become increasingly complex and difficult to understand".</p>
      <p>The GSC recommended the government develop a fresh Pyrmont precinct masterplan, economic strategy and planning process.</p>
      <p>"We're working on a bold new masterplan for Pyrmont that will allow it to be the city's next entertainment and innovation hub," NSW Planning Minister Rob Stokes said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"We're keen for the Star to collaborate on this work to ensure any new development is delivered as part of a strategic plan for a revitalised peninsula."</p>
      <p>Ms O'Regan said she supported Mr Stokes' plan for change.</p>
      <p>"The Premier and Treasurer have been saying that Pyrmont is open for business, but this decision flies in the face of that sentiment, so it's encouraging that the Government is today signalling that the IPC's decision isn't final and there is a way around it," Ms O'Regan said.</p>
      <p>"The western harbour precinct has been labelled the new frontier for Sydney's growth as a competitive global destination and it urgently needs a definitive plan in order to capitalise on its potential."</p>
      <p>The Ritz-Carlton application's IPC referral came on the heels of objections from the City of Sydney Council and the local community.</p>
      <p>City of Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore welcomed the IPC's decision, saying it was a "win for the community and the integrity of the planning system".</p>
      <p>"Approving this development would have required the most significant departure from planning controls in NSW history," Ms Moore said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for The Star said the company was still "digesting" the decision.</p>
