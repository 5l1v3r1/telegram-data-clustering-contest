      <p>I find that physical health definitely has an impact on burnout; not taking care of ourselves, burning the candle at both ends, not sleeping, eating badly, and not resting - these all contribute to the physical side of burnout. There’s also the mental/emotional side that I look at that has a huge impact on the physical, for example, not being nice to ourselves, negative self-talk, worrying, not giving ourselves a break, spending time with people who exhaust us and aren’t nourishing for our spirit, and giving too much without receiving — these will all also contribute to burnout.</p>
      <p>While the physical aspect is big, the emotional (to me) is bigger, AND, I’ve found in my work that there are other things that can contribute to even more. I write about organizational burnout in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contagious-Culture-Intentionally-Organization-Thrives/dp/1259584577/ref=pd_sbs_14_1/136-5563492-2378814?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1259584577&amp;pd_rd_r=49b0e286-1785-4ea3-94a3-fcae25c85272&amp;pd_rd_w=MN4Cb&amp;pd_rd_wg=YkJQa&amp;pf_rd_p=52b7592c-2dc9-4ac6-84d4-4bda6360045e&amp;pf_rd_r=A651ZJGSAED56S5Y94D3&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=A651ZJGSAED56S5Y94D3"><i>Contagious Culture</i></a> and the 7 factors that go with it. And in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contagious-You-Unlock-Influence-Create-dp-126045410X/dp/126045410X/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1573193592">Contagious You</a> (coming out 11/15/19), I’ve dug deeper going into personal burnout and what creates that.</p>
      <p>In my work, I found the 7Ps of burnout - I’ll give you 4 here because I find that if we get conscious with these 4, it sets the others up well.</p>
      <p><b>Disconnecting from the Presence and the Pause:</b> Not giving ourselves time outs, not being present in the moment (constantly in the past or the future or multi-tasking), and not pausing to appreciate the moment, give ourselves 5 minutes between meetings (or thoughts), or take a minute between projects or big events in our lives.</p>
      <p><b>Disconnecting from Purpose:</b> Forgetting why we do what we do and who we do it for, what’s important about it for us, this is our WHY - it’s fuel. Forget your purpose, and what’s meaningful about what you’re doing, and things get exhausting fast.</p>
      <p><b>Disconnecting from People:</b> Forgetting the people that we’re actually serving and connected with and those we love and lead (and why) - as well as forgetting that we have people who love us, support us, and are here for us too. This is where connection and asking for help comes in. If we forget people, then what’s the point? We have more ways than ever to connect, and I notice we’re often also more isolated than ever. This P is crucial to well-being. (Notice that all Ps work together.)</p>
      <p><b>Disconnecting from Pain, Pleasure, and Play:</b> This is about allowing for full authentic emotion and allowing not only for our pleasure and play but also for our pain. If we override our emotions when we’re hurting, angry, in pain, etc. we’re not allowing ourselves our full experience of our humanness. I see it so often that a leader/human will override the fact that they’re hurt or angry, stifle it (often because they don’t think they can have it “as a leader,” ie. they have to show up “perfectly”), and then it either comes out later and gets projected on their team, or it manifests itself in something even bigger that may require even more support and have even more impact, or they get totally exhausted because they’re not getting the attention and care they need. OR all of the above. Bypassing our authentic emotions takes a lot of energy. We want to allow for all of ourselves and give ourselves the appropriate support and places to do so.</p>
      <p>So those are 4 of the Ps… I find if you address one, the others seem to be affected as well. When we take care of ourselves physically and mentally and work our Ps we’re better armed and in partnership with ourselves to navigate the complexity of our lives and leadership.</p>
