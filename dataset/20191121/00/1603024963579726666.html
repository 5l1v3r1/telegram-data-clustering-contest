      <p>The Centre is considering formulation of the National Textiles Policy in consultation with states, Union Minister Smriti Irani said on November 21. "The National Textile Policy is currently under consideration due to our consultation with the states," she said while replying during Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>Replying to a supplementary question in the Upper House, Irani said in addition to existing markets, 12 new markets have been identified to boost opportunities in the export segment of textiles industry.</p>
      <p>"We are also in the process of ensuring that the small exporters become mid-sized companies through interventions by various government ministries," the minister said.</p>
      <p>She informed the House that under the ATUFS scheme, 1,868 applications have been received from various industry partners who have said that they have received a reported investment of Rs 13,612 crore post the Rs 6,000 package being announced.</p>
      <p>Responding to a supplementary question on refunds of embedded taxes to exporters, Irani observed that taxation was not under the ambit of her ministry (textiles) but assured that the government is seized of the challenges.</p>
      <p>"It is the first time in the history of textile industry in our country that embedded state and central taxes were refunded to our industry and the industry, in its conversation with not only my ministry (textiles) but ministry of finance, commerce and external affairs explores every possibility to strengthen possibilities of our industry," she said.</p>
      <p>To another supplementary question on what would have been effect on textiles industry if India chose to sign Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) mega trade deal, Irani complimented Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present in the House at the time, on behalf of the textiles industry, for taking such a strong stand to protect the interests of India's manufacturing sector.</p>
      <p>"In fact we have been diligently trying to follow up FTA possibilities with nations which for years were never signed," the minister said.</p>
      <p>She thanked the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar for partnering with the Textile Ministry to explore such opportunities.</p>
      <p>In a written reply, Irani stated the export of apparel under special package (October 2016 to August 2019) is Rs 3,27,895 crore which has increased by Rs 16,914 crore as compared with the previous corresponding period. No data on fixed term/direct jobs is available.</p>
      <p>In another written reply, she said under comprehensive Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS), a total of 11.14 lakh persons have been trained during FY 2010-11 to 2017-18, in various diverse segments of textiles covering textiles and apparel, jute, spinning, weaving, technical textiles, sericulture, handloom and handicrafts.</p>
      <p>The training in ISDS also covered 33 states and Union Territories of the country, widely covering all sections such as women (71.27 per cent), Scheduled Castes (20.82 per cent), Scheduled Tribes (6.9 per cent) and divyang jan (0.28 per cent). Out of the 11.14 lakh persons trained so far, 8.43 lakh persons have been employed.</p>
      <p>She said special emphasis is also being laid on upskilling in apparel and garment segment for increasing competitiveness in the industry in global market.</p>
