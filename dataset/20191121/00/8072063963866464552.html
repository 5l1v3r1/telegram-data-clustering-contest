      <p><b>(SKY NEWS) –</b> Germany’s three largest car manufacturers have been fined a total of €100m for forming a cartel to buy steel for their automobile components.</p>
      <p>Germany’s federal cartel office announced the fine for BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler.</p>
      <p>The regulator said that from 2004 to 2013, the carmakers regularly met steelmakers and other companies in the supply chain to discuss paying uniform surcharges when purchasing steel.</p>
      <p>The watchdog added that unlawful prices resulting from the cartel were paid until at least 2016.</p>
      <p>BMW said it would pay a penalty amounting to €28m.</p>
      <p>Daimler will have to pay €23.5m, a spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen, Germany’s biggest carmaker which also owns Audi, declined to comment on the amount it would pay but welcomed the end of the cartel probe.</p>
      <p>The cartel office said that purchasing prices for long steel products – the type of steel affected by the cartel and which is used for crankshafts, gearwheels or steering rods – account for less than 1% of a car’s final value.</p>
      <p>Andreas Mundt, president of the cartel office, said: “Between 2004 and the end of 2013, representatives of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen regularly met twice a year with steel manufacturers, forging companies and large systems suppliers, and exchanged information on uniform surcharges for the purchase of long steel products.</p>
      <p>“Scrap and alloy surcharges account for a substantial part of the purchase prices for long steel.</p>
      <p>“Insofar as the surcharges were no longer negotiated individually with the suppliers as a consequence of these talks, price competition between the companies on these price components was eliminated.”</p>
      <p>The fining decisions are not yet final and can be appealed along with the findings contained in them to the Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court.</p>
      <p>The case is not related to the European Commission’s current investigations into German car manufacturers suspected of colluding on emission control technologies.</p>
