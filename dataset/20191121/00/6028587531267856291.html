      <p><b>Topline: </b>Billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/442/201911219166072442/201911219166072442.pdf">filed paperwork</a> to run in the 2020 presidential race on the Democratic ticket⁠—but it’s still unclear if he’s actually running as a late entry crowded field of 17 candidates. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bloomberg, 77, has previously said he was considering a 2020 run but had not officially made a decision.</li>
        <li>He has already <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/07/billionaire-michael-bloomberg-readies-2020-presidential-campaign/#43c104e52229">filed</a> to appear on primary ballots in Texas, Alabama and Arkansas.</li>
        <li>If Bloomberg ran, he would likely present himself as a centrist candidate in contrast to progressives Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.</li>
        <li>In March he said he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-05/our-highest-office-my-deepest-obligation">would not</a> enter the race, citing “the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”</li>
        <li>Bloomberg has <a href="https://apnews.com/16abd2f36e624f2e8065303d4b8d9c50">also committed</a> $15 million to $20 million for a voter registration drive in five battleground states and $100 million for an online advertising campaign to attack President Trump in four swing states. </li>
        <li>A spokesperson for Bloomberg told MSNBC that the federal filing is “not an announcement and not indicative of a decision.” </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Big number:</b> $100 million. That’s how much of his own fortune Bloomberg might spend on a presidential run, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/26/mike-bloomberg-likely-to-spend-over-100-million-on-a-2020-campaign-for-president-if-he-chooses-to-run.html">according to</a> one of his political advisors in 2018.</p>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>Bloomberg cofounded financial information and media company Bloomberg LP in 1981. He put in the seed funding for the company and now owns 88% of the business, which has estimated revenues of $10 billion. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#46ac34161417"><i>Forbes</i></a> estimates Bloomberg’s net worth at $52 billion. He has also reportedly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/14/bloomberg-signals-he-would-run-for-president-if-biden-struggles-against-warren.html">been in contact</a> with allies to rethink the 2020 race. If he ends up running, he will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/mike-bloomberg-files-federal-paperwork-to-run-for-president-in-2020.html">likely</a> focus on Super Tuesday states and forgo early primaries in Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire. </p>
      <p><b>Tangent: </b>Bloomberg was not the only one considering a last-ditch presidential run as moderate Democrats in the party <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/anxiety-rises-among-democrats-worried-about-partys-prospects-in-2020/2019/10/22/b9c015d4-f4d9-11e9-8cf0-4cc99f74d127_story.html">worry</a> about their chances in a general election if a more liberal candidate gets the nomination. After initially saying he wouldn’t run, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/14/779153382/deval-patrick-makes-a-late-entry-into-the-2020-presidential-race">entered the race</a> on November 14 and is likely to seek out the same centrist voters as Bloomberg.</p>
