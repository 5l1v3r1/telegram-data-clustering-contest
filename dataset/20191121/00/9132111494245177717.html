      <p>Prof. Ransford Gyampo Head of European Studies at the University was captured in a BBC Africa Eye documentary dubbed ‘sex for grades’ persuading a BBC reporter to meet him at the mall where he was caught on camera making “numerous inappropriate demands.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Paul Kwame Butakor, another lecturer at the Department of Teacher Education of the School of Education and Leadership on the other hand, was lustfully admiring and trying to woo a supposed prospective applicant to a Master Degree programme in his Department by telling her that his wife if out of the country and therefore would want to have her [applicant] to make him her side guy.</p>
      <p>Well, in a post on twitter sighted by MyNewsGh.com, it seems something unnatural is about to happen.</p>
      <p>The post was done by twitter user My Leakz with two separate pictures with the caption: "Hello Ghana, I have a surprise for you all. Before the surprise can someone please check if Dr Bu and Prof. Gya are doing well, I don’t want any heart attack. I have a nice video here titled BuGya featuring two most popular Leg lecturers dropping soon…”.</p>
      <p>MyNewsGh.com can not state whether the post or the picture is truly about the two Lectures.</p>
