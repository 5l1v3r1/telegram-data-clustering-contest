      <h1>Frankie Edgar: Facing ‘dangerous’ Cory Sandhagen in bantamweight debut gets me on the ladder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Guillen Jr.</a></address>
      <p>After spending the majority of his mixed martial arts (MMA) career at Lightweight and then Featherweight, former 155-pound champion, Frankie Edgar, will make the drop down to Bantamweight for his next fight.</p>
      <p>Indeed, “The Answer” will face Cory Sandhagen in the co-main event of the upcoming UFC Fight Night 166 event in Raleigh, North Carolina on Jan. 25, 2020. For Edgar, facing the <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/19/20972220/latest-ufc-rankings-conor-mcgregor-continues-fade-shogun-rua-dropped-top-15-mma">No. 3 ranked guy</a> in the division is perfect, as a victory puts him right in the mix.</p>
      <p>“He’s very dangerous. He’s No. 3, and I still want to fight the best guys in my career, and I feel like fighting No. 3 is a good way to debut at this new weight class,” Edgar said in the latest episode of <a href="http://www.ufcunfiltered.com/">“UFC Unfiltered”</a> via <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/frankie-edgar-views-cory-sandhagen-as-opportunity-to-climb-bantamweight-rankings-quickly">MMA Junkie</a>.</p>
      <p>Winner of seven in a row, Cory will look to score his biggest win so far over a former 155-pound champion, a big opportunity for the 27 year-old.</p>
      <p>“For a guy like Cory to come in and fight someone like myself is definitely good for him, but to me I’m looking at it (like) he’s No. 3, and it’s definitely a good way to get myself on a ladder in the 135-pound division,” Edgar said.</p>
      <p>Since 2016, Frankie has amassed an even 3-3 record inside the Octagon, with two of those defeats coming in 145-pound title fights, once to Jose Aldo and the other to Max Holloway at UFC 240 earlier this year (<a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/7/28/8933303/ufc-240-full-fight-video-highlights-holloway-edgar-cyborg-espn-mma-edmonton">highlights</a>).</p>
      <p>Given “The Answer’s” past accomplishments and name value, it isn’t too farfetched to believe he can jump the line a hurry at 135 pounds if he can rack up a couple of impressive wins.</p>
      <p>Handing Sandhagen his first loss since 2017 is a great way to start.</p>
