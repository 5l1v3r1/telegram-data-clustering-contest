        <b>Joe Dodoo is yet to score since joining Bolton Wanderers from Scottish giants Rangers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has provided two assists in seven matches but has gone barren infront of goal.</p>
      <p>Dodoo's contract at Ibrox was terminated on deadline day in the summer but appears his struggles in front of goal has continued unabated.</p>
      <p>Since joining, he’s made seven appearances in all competitions – five in the league, one in the EFL Trophy and one in the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>He impressed in a first league win of the season away at Bristol Rovers last month, and he’s registered two assists to date.</p>
      <p>However, his barren spell in front of goal continues.</p>
