      <p>MCX Gold December has been failing to sustain at higher levels near 38300 levels and reversed on the downside towards 38050 levels. This has been keeping prices in a range.</p>
      <p>International Gold has formed Bearish candlestick pattern in the last session which indicates fall from hereon is possible. We can expect Gold to trade in the range of 37800 and 38150 levels.</p>
      <p>Intraday strategy: MCX Gold December Sell in the range of 38100-38130 with 38220 as stop loss and target of 37900 levels.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Expert: Jateen Trivedi, Sr. Research Analyst - Commodity &amp; Currency at LKP Securities Ltd</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the daily chart, Gold traded flat on Wednesday waiting for triggers. Prices have been trading flat for a week. The ATR has significantly dropped from 500+ in Sep19 to below 400 showing signs of less of trending, and more of a news based reaction market for more than a month now.</p>
      <p>Prices keep trading near 20-Days EMA placed at Rs 38070 and is holding 100-Days EMA placed at 37,398 but majorly trading in the range of 37500-38400.</p>
      <p>For the day, on the upside 38300-38650 shall act as a supply zone, and 38100-37900 is likely to act as a support.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Expert: Hareesh V, Head Commodity Research at Geojit Financial Services .</b>
      </p>
      <p>MCX Gold December: Intraday bias largely on the downside as long as Rs 38300 caps the upside. The immediate support is placed at Rs 38000 which if cleared would extend the momentum towards Rs 37790 followed by Rs 37600 levels. However, consistent trades above Rs 38330 would take prices higher towards Rs 38560 or more.</p>
