      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - With <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Kawhi Leonard</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">Paul George</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lou-williams/">Lou Williams</a> on the court, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Boston Celtics</a> had to pick someone to leave unguarded.</p>
      <p>They chose <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-beverley/">Patrick Beverley</a> and he made them pay.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-beverley/">Beverley</a> shined on both ends, playing his usual ornery defense while scoring 14 points and grabbing a career-high 16 rebounds to help the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Los Angeles Clippers</a> win 107-104 in overtime with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> playing together for the first time Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>“If I was a coach, I’d leave me open all the time,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-beverley/">Beverley</a> said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lou-williams/">Williams</a> scored 27 points, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> added 25 and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> had 17 for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a>, who improved to 9-1 at home after rallying from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <p>In their first season with Los Angeles, injury and rehab had prevented <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> from playing alongside each other for the first 14 games.</p>
      <p>“It’s still tough,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a>, who missed the previous three games with a sore knee. “We’re both on kind of minute restrictions so it’s hard to get a flow.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> said he and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> are trying to get in sync with their other teammates.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to have growing pains,” he said. “The great thing about myself and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Kawhi</a> is it doesn’t matter, we’re going to play basketball. Try to make the right plays and play off each other and just keep the game flowing. I thought in that aspect we were good.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>It was a wild and sloppy game for both teams. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a> committed 23 turnovers (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lou-williams/">Williams</a> had seven while <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> had five each) to 17 for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a>.</p>
        <p>“That was an ugly win, but it was beautiful,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a> coach Doc Rivers said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> blocked Kemba Walker’s potential tying 3-point attempt in the left corner.</p>
        <p>“He got enough separation to get it off against most of the league,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> coach Brad Stevens said. “The problem is, that guy’s not normal. He’s not most of the league, and he made a great play to block it.”</p>
        <p>In overtime, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> hit a 3-pointer after he missed his first attempt and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-beverley/">Beverley</a> got the offensive rebound, then <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> fed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-beverley/">Beverley</a> for a 3 of his own. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a>’s free throw on a technical foul against Stevens completed a run of seven straight points, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a> led 104-99.</p>
        <p>“He literally singlehandedly willed that game with his effort, rebounding, making plays,” Rivers said of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-beverley/">Beverley</a>, who got the game ball. “He’s a tough kid.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> pulled to 104-102 on Jayson Tatum’s basket after a wild sequence in which bodies crashed to the floor as both teams chased a loose ball before Boston got possession.</p>
        <p>“Defensive mistakes, costly turnovers,” Tatum said. “If we would have won it still would have been a learning experience.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-beverley/">Beverley</a> hit a 3-pointer from the corner in front of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a>’ bench for 107-102 lead, revving up Los Angeles fans and quieting the large contingent of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> fans in the stands.</p>
        <p>“It was a playoff atmosphere,” said Marcus Smart, who had 14 points for Boston.</p>
        <p>Tatum’s basket left the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> down by three. Walker, who had 13 points, got free in the corner for the last shot but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> leaped to deflect it.</p>
        <p>Tatum led the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> with 30 points and Brad Wanamaker added 14.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lou-williams/">Williams</a> hit a go-ahead 3 with 31 seconds remaining in regulation.</p>
        <p>With the crowd on its feet shouting “Defense! Defense!” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lou-williams/">Williams</a> stole the ball at the other end and got fouled, making both for a 97-94 lead.</p>
        <p>After a timeout, Tatum hit a 3-pointer with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> falling down defending him to tie it 97-all with 13 seconds left.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a>’s potential game-winning 3 rattled in and out as regulation ended.</p>
        <p>“We’ve got some kinks to work out,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lou-williams/">Williams</a> said. “Just understanding what everybody brings to the table.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> led by 10 early in the fourth but got outscored 13-7 over the final 3:16.</p>
        <p>Boston missed 17 of 18 3-pointers in the first half. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> then made seven 3s in the third quarter, with Tatum hitting four, to go into the fourth leading 75-69.</p>
        <p>Walker’s 3-pointer pushed the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> to their largest lead, 86-76, in the fourth. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a> ran off eight points in a row, getting 3s from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-beverley/">Beverley</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lou-williams/">Williams</a>, to trail 86-84.</p>
        <p>Neither team led by more than 10 points in the game.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> combined to score the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a>’ first 11 points of the third for a 51-45 lead.</p>
        <p>That’s when the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> kicked in from long range, with Tatum hitting back-to-back 3-pointers and Walker following with another. Tatum connected on consecutive 3s later in the period, too.</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a>: They dominated in the paint, 52-32. … Daniel Theis had 14 rebounds and five fouls.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a>: Their bench outscored the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a>’ reserves 43-29. … The teams were even on the boards with 53 apiece.</p>
        <p>DUNK THIS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> got around Smart on his way to the basket and dunked one-handed over Theis in the fourth.</p>
        <p>“That’s Finals MVP,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> said. “He knows when it’s time to take over. He’s been there.”</p>
        <p>MANY MINUTES</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kawhi-leonard/">Leonard</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> each played 37 minutes, which is more than Rivers would have liked. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> had been kept around 28-30 since returning.</p>
        <p>“This is preseason for me in terms of my condition and getting speed and playing at this level,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> said. “I was a little winded.”</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
