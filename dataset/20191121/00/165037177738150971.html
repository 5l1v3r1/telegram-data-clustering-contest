        <b>Real Madrid have a great unknown in their dressing room, Gareth Bale. His exit was in the air, but the flag incident has placed him one step closer to the exit door. It was speculated that Tottenham, now with Mourinho in charge, would like to welcome him, but the Welshman would not agree with the deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>At least, that is what was said on 'El Chiringuito'. According to José Luis Sánchez,<b> Bale </b>would say 'no' to a <b>hypothetical offer</b> from his ex-team, Tottenham.</p>
