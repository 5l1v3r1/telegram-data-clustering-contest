      <h1>AKA Reacts To Burna Boy’s Grammy Nomination</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gbenga Sijuade</a></address>
      <p>South African rapper and songwriter, <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/24/xenophobia-why-burna-boy-must-apologise-aka/"><u><b>Kiernan Jarryd Forbes</b></u></a> known professionally as AKA has congratulated Nigerian born hip-hop star <b>Burna Boy</b> on his Grammy nominations.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> understands that the South African rapper was forced to congratulate him after a fan asked AKA that, “@akaworldwide Burna just got nominated for a Grammy, what do you have to say??”.</p>
      <p>It will also be recalled that <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/20/burna-boy-nominated-for-2020-grammy-awards-full-list/"><u><b>Burna Boy’s nomination</b> </u></a>coincides with the cancellation of his scheduled performance at the Africa Unites Concert in South Africa.</p>
      <p>The concert was reportedly cancelled due to uproar from South Africans. They kicked up a fuss because of Burna Boy’s comments in the wake of xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa earlier in the year.</p>
      <p>When Burna was then announced as a headlining act for the South African concert, AKA and other South Africans demanded an apology from Burna.</p>
      <p>Here is AKA’s congratulatory message below:</p>
