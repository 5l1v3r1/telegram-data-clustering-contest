      <h1>Big Match Focus: Manchester City v Chelsea (Saturday 17:30 GMT)</h1>

      <p>Their title hopes dwindling, Manchester City face another tough assignment when Premier League action resumes this weekend as they welcome Chelsea to the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>The back-to-back English champions lost 3-1 away to Liverpool in their most recent outing and find themselves fourth in the table, nine points adrift of the unbeaten leaders.</p>
      <p>Saturday's visit of Chelsea is far from ideal for Pep Guardiola, then, with Frank Lampard's in-form side sitting a point better off than City after winning six league games in a row. </p>
      <p>Chelsea's youngsters are firing on all cylinders while City's big hitters have seemingly gone off the boil, but the Blues have lost three of their last four top-flight trips to City, including a 6-0 thrashing in this corresponding fixture last season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CHELSEA PUNCHING ABOVE THEIR WEIGHT</b>
      </p>
      <p>The loss of Eden Hazard, coupled with a transfer ban that, as things stand, will stretch into a second window, was supposed to spell the end of Chelsea's top-four aspirations.</p>
      <p>That has been far from the case, however, with Lampard being given freedom to turn to youth in his debut campaign as a Premier League boss.</p>
      <p>A 26-point gap separated the sides last season, yet with nearly a third of the current campaign played it is Chelsea who are better positioned.</p>
      <p>The obvious question, of course, is whether they can last the distance and maintain their push for silverware on multiple fronts.</p>
      <p>Chelsea were also third after 12 games last season, but the mood is far more positive around Stamford Bridge compared to 12 months ago when Maurizio Sarri was in charge.</p>
      <p>The shift to focus on youth has yielded dividends, with Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount thriving, but there is one major flaw to this Chelsea side - an inability to defend.</p>
      <p>They have conceded 17 league goals so far - no side in the top nine has let in more - and shipped four at home to Ajax in the Champions League earlier this month.</p>
      <p>City, too, have had defensive issues of late, highlighted in the defeat at Anfield that saw their makeshift back four opened up countless times.</p>
      <p>Guardiola's men have registered four clean sheets in their last 11 league games, contributing to three defeats already this term - one fewer than in the whole of their title-winning campaign last time out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HEAD-TO-HEAD: SERGIO AGUERO V TAMMY ABRAHAM</b>
      </p>
      <p>Keeping out the opposition has been a problem for both sides, but they have certainly not lacked goals of their own.</p>
      <p>No Premier League team has scored more goals than City's 35 this term, with Sergio Aguero responsible for nine of those.</p>
      <p>Aguero tends to fare well in this fixture, too, having scored 10 top-flight goals against Chelsea - only versus Newcastle United (15) and Tottenham (11) has he managed more.</p>
      <p>The Argentina international has found the net eight times in his last six league appearances against the London outfit, including a hat-trick in the 6-0 thrashing nine months ago.</p>
      <p>Only two players have scored more Premier League goals than Aguero in 2019-20, one of those being Tammy Abraham, who will lead the line for Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Abraham has netted in back-to-back top-flight fixtures and has opened the scoring in five different league games this term - at least two more than any other player.</p>
      <p>Nine of his 10 goals have been scored from open play inside the box - eight with his right foot and one with his head - while Aguero has six open-play goals inside the area.</p>
      <p>Both players have two assists to their name, showing that there is more to their game than just finding the back of the net.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FORM GUIDE</b>
      </p>
      <p>City have been beaten by Norwich City, Wolves and Liverpool in their last eight league matches - as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 26 games in the competition.</p>
      <p>The 2-0 loss to Wolves came at the Etihad Stadium on October 6 and Tottenham drew 2-2 there in August, but City have won 13 of their 15 home league matches in 2019.</p>
      <p>Chelsea beat Palace 2-0 last time out to make it six successive Premier League wins, a feat they last achieved in May 2017 when winning the title under Antonio Conte.</p>
      <p>Away from home, meanwhile, Lampard's side have won five in a row, scoring 18 goals in those matches at an average of 3.6 per game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HISTORY SAYS...</b>
      </p>
      <p>City were penalty shoot-out winners when the sides met in last season's EFL Cup final following a goalless draw and tend to perform well in this fixture.</p>
      <p>The reigning champions have won three of the last four Premier League meetings between the sides, keeping three clean sheets in the process.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have collected just two victories from their last 10 league trips to City, winning 1-0 in February 2004 and 3-1 in December 2016.</p>
      <p>They shipped six goals in the most recent league encounter and have kept only one clean sheet in their last 12 visits to the Etihad Stadium.</p>
