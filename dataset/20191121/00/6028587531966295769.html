      <p>The <a href="http://www.shoppbs.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/filmmore/description.html">telegraph</a> from J.P. Morgan had just one line: "Congratulations, Mr. Carnegie, you are the richest man in the world." Andrew Carnegie had sold his steel empire, netting him a personal payout of $250 million (approximately $7.5 billion today). He would spend the next two decades becoming the world’s greatest philanthropist. Carnegie had gone from an impoverished Scottish immigrant to the pinnacle of American industry. What was the secret behind his remarkable rise? From his earliest days, Carnegie saw every job, no matter how menial, as an opportunity to excel.</p>
      <h3>Climbing the ladder</h3>
      <p>Andrew Carnegie was born in 1835 in a shared single-room cottage in Dunfermline, Scotland. His father was a hand-weaver, a trade that would be nearly eliminated by industrialization. When his father’s business failed, Carnegie and his family faced starvation. In dire straits, they decided to make a new start in America.</p>
      <p>The teenage Carnegie got his first job at a cotton mill near Pittsburgh. He worked as a bobbin boy, changing spools of thread. He spent six days a week at the factory, frequently working 12-hour days, for a weekly salary of $1.20 (less than $40 a week today). Despite the rough conditions, Carnegie felt a profound sense of purpose. In <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17976/17976-h/17976-h.htm">his autobiography</a>, he recalled, “I have made millions since, but none of those millions gave me such happiness as my first week's earnings. I was now a helper of the family, a breadwinner.”</p>
      <p>A local manufacturer observed Carnegie’s work ethic and hired him to run a steam-engine. This job provided a raise to $2.00 per week but proved exhausting. After a few weeks, he was ready to quit. However, he thought about his parents’ sacrifices, and he knew he could not give up. One day, the manufacturer needed help with his bills. Carnegie had spent his free time improving his math skills and now seized the chance to become a clerk.</p>
      <p>About a year later, a local telegraph office manager was looking for a new messenger. Carnegie was mentioned as a reliable and diligent young man. For $2.50 a week, Carnegie would spend his days racing around the city. To help him with this new job, he memorized the streets of Pittsburgh and the locations of important businesses. One night, Carnegie’s boss took him aside, declaring him the best messenger in the office and promising him a bonus. The moment filled him with such pride that he was “moved to tears of joy.”</p>
      <p>Soon after, Carnegie was asked to fill in for a telegraph operator. When an assistant operator job opened, Carnegie was quickly promoted into the full-time role. He took the time to familiarize himself with the telegraph sounds, making him much faster than the other operators at taking messages. When a disaster hit a nearby town, he was dispatched to work the telegraph lines.</p>
      <p>The superintendent of the railway, Thomas A. Scott, noticed this promising young man and asked Carnegie to become his private secretary for $4.00 a week. Scott taught Carnegie about investments and exposed him to a variety of new businesses. When the Civil War broke out and Scott was appointed to manage the North’s railways, he brought Carnegie along as his right-hand man. In this role, Carnegie noticed that the country needed a massive infrastructure overhaul. He was sure that steel would be America’s building material of the future. He poured his accumulated investment earnings into opening a steel mill. The rest, they say, is history.</p>
      <h3>Stand out from the crowd</h3>
      <p>Andrew Carnegie believed that no job was beneath him. Even from his humble beginnings, he showed a dedication to his work that separated him from his peers.</p>
      <p>Many of us have had unpleasant, tedious, and tiring jobs. It is natural for your energy level to match your interest level. However, that is a huge mistake. A dull job often provides a golden opportunity to stand out. If your coworkers are demotivated, your extra effort is more likely to be noticed. In Carnegie’s early career, he worked in some particularly difficult environments, and yet he always found ways for his drive to shine through.</p>
      <p>Regardless of your job, your title, or your salary, every day you can bring a commitment to excellence. You can always go the extra mile for your customers, your managers, or your company. Your enthusiasm may not only open doors, but it can also make you enjoy your job more. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-perception_theory">self-perception theory</a>, behavior informs attitude as much as attitude informs behavior.</p>
      <p>Carnegie said, “the average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity and stands on its head for those few and far between souls who devote 100%.” He was right. If you want to be a success, you need to be all in.</p>
      <h3>A lasting legacy</h3>
      <p>Carnegie believed “the man who dies rich, dies disgraced.” After selling his business, he brought his trademark passion to philanthropy. By his death in 1919, he had given away over $350 million (as a share of GDP, his donations would equal nearly $80 billion today).</p>
      <p>Carnegie believed that education could transform society. He funded the creation of over 3000 libraries across the world. He also gave generously to scholarships and teachers’ pension funds. Perhaps most notably, he founded the Carnegie Technical Schools to educate Pittsburgh’s working-class. The schools <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/about/history.html">grew into the world-renowned Carnegie Mellon University</a> (CMU). In building these schools, Carnegie remarked, “my heart is in the work,” which became CMU’s motto. Looking at Andrew Carnegie’s life, it could have been his personal motto too. </p>
