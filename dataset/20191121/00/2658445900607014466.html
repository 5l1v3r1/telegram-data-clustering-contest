      <p>Forensic science has come of age and will soon become an indispensable apparatus to the  crime investigation and detective intelligence gathering, Prof. Kalu Ogbureke of the University of Texas Health Science Centre, has said.</p>
      <p>He spoke at the first forensic conference last Wednesday at the Julius Berger Hall, University of Lagos (UNILAG).</p>
      <p>The conference was organised by the Society for Forensic and Analytical Scientists Nigeria(SFASN) and Nabraska Institute of Forensic Science, Lincoln USA in conjunction with the department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science of the University.</p>
      <p>Ogbureke highlighted that forensic science covers various fields such as Criminality, Forensic anthropology, Pathology, Biology Toxicology among others which security agents can use in curbing criminal activities.</p>
      <p>He added that forensic science will set the pace for a new, emerging society and national progress, praising President Muhammadu Buhari for signing Forensic Evidence Bill into law.</p>
      <p>Associate Professor, Idowu Taiwo said criminals were taking advantage of the fact that forensic analysis had not been implemented in crime investigations.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“Forensic analytical investigations have come a long way in proffering solutions to problems encountered in various categories of events from the past till now with a view that forensic analysis had created fora for crime and investigations.”</p>
      <p>Taiwo said forensic science analysis would help investigators unravel crimes,  adding that forensic genetics was crucial in crime detection.</p>
      <p>Dr. Matthias Okoye of Nebraska Institute of Forensic Sciences, Lincoln, USA also proffered solutions on crime scene investigations and how documentations should be done, as well as types of samples to be collected and critical issues of DNA samplings.</p>
      <p>Dr. Azeezat Alaafia, spoke about Forensic Entomology as an enabling property for  the identification of victims and unrecognisable casualties in crucial matters.</p>
      <p>The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin  Ogundipe, praised  the Department of Cell Biology and Genetics of the university for making the epoch-making  occasion a reality.</p>
