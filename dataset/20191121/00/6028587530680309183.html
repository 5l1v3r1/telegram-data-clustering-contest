      <h1>Dr. Amy Wechsler Wants To Keep You Looking Fresh, Even After That Second Glass Of Champagne</h1>

      <p>As one of the sole physicians who’s board-certified in both dermatology and psychiatry, <a href="https://www.dramywechsler.com/">Dr. Amy Wechsler</a> understands the behavioral dilemma of holiday excess. The idea that we want so badly to indulge during this time of year, but don’t want to pay the price with dehydrated, blotchy skin and breakouts. So in my effort to have that second piece of cake - and eat it, too - I reached out to the preeminent dermatologist of the Upper East Side, whose best-selling 2008 book, <a href="http://www.dramywechsler.com/mind-beauty-connection-book"><i>The Mind-Beauty Connection</i></a> offers advice on achieving a healthy lifestyle and beautiful skin, to find out what I can get away with this holiday without it showing up on my face.</p>

        <b>The holidays are here! In advance of this gluttonous time of year, what are some steps we can take preventatively to care for our skin now so that we can indulge a bit and not look totally worse for the wear?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In advance of a hectic and gluttonous holiday season, it’s really helpful to get enough sleep (adults need seven-and-a-half to eight hours a night) and to keep up with exercise regimens. Our skin heals and repairs during sleep, and endorphins released during exercise also help the skin to heal and keep moods good when the decrease in light and cold weather negatively affect moods. </p>
      <p>
        <b> For those of us who might be traveling, and whose schedules go awry, what are the some of the regimen rules we can bend and what can we absolutely not skimp out on? </b>
      </p>
      <p>I may sound like a broken record, but getting enough sleep is crucial to healthy skin and overall well-being. That can be tough during travel, especially across time zones, but it’s important to make sleep a priority. It’s also key to continue one’s usual skin care regimen, which means traveling with your own skin care products. I think it’s OK to indulge in foods while traveling, especially ones that are unique and special to the region you are visiting. </p>
      <p> <b>What are some morning-after steps to care for our complexion following a late night out? </b></p>
      <p>Alcohol and sleep deprivation are drying to the skin and give one’s appearance a sallow and dull look. It’s a good idea to rehydrate well, exercise to improve circulation to the skin and moisturize.</p>
      <p> <b>What are the absolute no-no's in so far as skincare, during the holidays, or ever? </b></p>
      <p>Absolute skin care no-no’s are skipping sunscreen and moisturizer. Unprotected sun wreaks havoc on the skin, and dry skin appears more wrinkly and the barrier will not work as well, making one prone to irritation and sensitivity.</p>
      <p>
        <b> What are your general wellness tips in navigating that one extra glass of champagne or slice of pie? And what havoc will this excess wreak on our skin? </b>
      </p>
      <p>For every glass of alcohol, make it a rule to have a full glass of water. Alcohol causes dehydration (by blocking ADH, antidiuretic hormone, therefore making us pee too much), so giving back the hydration, glass by glass, is helpful. That extra slice of pie should not cause skin problems! Eating a high protein snack before a holiday party can cut dessert cravings, but it’s much healthier to eat the pie instead of drinking the extra glass of champagne. If both are consumed, give yourself a break, since the holidays only come once a year!</p>
      <p>
        <b> Can you share any other holiday skincare tips you live by?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think it’s OK to indulge, but in moderation. Trying to be too strict can set you up to fail, and to miss out on some of life’s most delicious treats. Try to maintain a regular skin care regimen – it can be that constant friend during a crazy, hectic time.</p>
