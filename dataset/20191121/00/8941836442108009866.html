      <p>DENVER (AP) - Rule No. 1 in defending <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">James Harden</a>: Throw different looks at him.</p>
      <p>Rule No. 2: See above.</p>
      <p>At least, that was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denver/">Denver</a>’s highly effective blueprint.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikola-jokic/">Nikola Jokic</a> had 27 points and 12 rebounds, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denver/">Denver</a> played smothering defense on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a> and the Nuggets beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> 105-95 on Wednesday night to snap the Rockets’ eight-game winning streak.</p>
      <p>“You have to have rules against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">James Harden</a>,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denver/">Denver</a> coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-malone/">Michael Malone</a> explained. “You can’t play him with your standard defense. Great player defense is required for great players.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>So, the Nuggets tried a little bit of everything to contain <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a>, even rolling the 7-foot <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikola-jokic/">Jokic</a> out high along with another defender.</p>
      <p>The variety of schemes did the trick - as much as it can against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a>’s star playmaker finished with 27 points, snapping his string of eight consecutive games with 36 or more. He was 8 of 16 from the floor as the Rockets were held under 100 points for the first time this season. They were averaging an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-basketball-association/">NBA</a>-best 119.5 per game.</p>
      <p>“We were locked in,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikola-jokic/">Jokic</a>, whose team is 7-0 this season when keeping an opponent below 100 points.</p>
      <p>Still, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikola-jokic/">Jokic</a> found it funny that his team was being lauded for “stopping” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a>.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“That’s crazy when a guy scores 27 and it’s bad,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikola-jokic/">Jokic</a> said. “We know he’s going to score. He’s going to be aggressive. Just make it harder and try to be there. … Just to give them different looks.”</p>
        <p>It worked - this time.</p>
        <p>“They just double-teamed every possession,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a> said. “They got lucky. They got away with one. We didn’t execute how we needed to.”</p>
        <p>The Rockets struggled from 3-point range, hitting 12 of 38. They did make at least 10 for a 71st straight game dating to last season.</p>
        <p>Russell Westbrook finished with 25 points on 8-of-22 shooting and Clint Capela grabbed 21 rebounds.</p>
        <p>“We had open shots,” Westbrook said. “We just didn’t make them.”</p>
        <p>Will Barton scored 15 points, while Torrey Craig and Juancho Hernangomez provided boosts off the bench as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denver/">Denver</a>’s reserves outscored the Rockets’ backups by a 32-21 margin.</p>
        <p>One of the key sequences came in the third quarter, when Paul Millsap blocked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a>’s shot and Barton turned it into a dunk on the other end. That energized the Pepsi Center crowd and sent the Nuggets on a pivotal run.</p>
        <p>It’s not easy making things difficult for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a>, who’s seen just about every defensive scheme imaginable.</p>
        <p>“He’s one of those guys that when you’re watching film it’s like watching a horror movie,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-malone/">Malone</a> said. “He’s that talented.”</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p>Rockets: F Danuel House Jr. hurt his shoulder after running through a screen set by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikola-jokic/">Jokic</a> in the third quarter. House will be evaluated Thursday. … G Ben McLemore was given a flagrant foul for a push in the fourth.</p>
        <p>Nuggets: Gary Harris and Jamal Murray each scored 10 points.</p>
        <p>CRAIG’S D</p>
        <p>Craig played a big role with three blocked shots in helping to limit Westbrook’s damage. Craig knew he was getting under his opponent’s skin when Westbrook lobbied to officials for foul calls.</p>
        <p>“That’s kind of a sign that I’m getting on his nerves a little bit,” said Craig, who also turned in an impressive dunk.</p>
        <p>SPURTS</p>
        <p>The first quarter was filled with plenty of spurts - a 7-0 run by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denver/">Denver</a>, soon followed by a 13-0 run for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> and then a 15-0 run by the Nuggets.</p>
        <p>ELITE CATEGORY</p>
        <p>Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni sees <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikola-jokic/">Jokic</a> in the same sort of category as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a> or Westbrook in being difficult to contain.</p>
        <p>“He’s going to do what he does. Same as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">James</a>,” D’Antoni said. “I don’t care what they do to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">James</a> - if he has a good game, it’s because of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">James</a>. If he has a bad game, it’s because of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">James</a>. Same with Russell. There are a few players that are that special.”</p>
        <p>NO FOULS</p>
        <p>Trying not to foul <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a> is easier said than done. He drew a foul on a 3-pointer the Nuggets challenged, believing he kicked out his left leg, but the call on the floor stood. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a> was 7 of 10 from the free throw line.</p>
        <p>“He’s a master at drawing the foul,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-malone/">Malone</a> said. “They changed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-basketball-association/">NBA</a> rules because of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">James Harden</a>.”</p>
