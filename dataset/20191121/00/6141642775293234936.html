      <p>Labour will pledge to invest £100 billion in Scotland over the next decade as Jeremy Corbyn unveils his party’s manifesto ahead of next month’s General Election.</p>
      <p>It marks an increase from the £70 billion previously announced by shadow chancellor John McDonnell.</p>
      <p>The figure based on policy commitments will include £20 billion of National Investment Bank funds plus £30 billion from the National Transformation Fund and £50 billion in Barnett consequentials.</p>
      <p>Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard hailed the move, saying it would transform Scotland’s “public services, our industries and wider infrastructure”.</p>
      <blockquote><b>Labour's proposed Scotland investment<br/></b>   •  £20 billion of National Investment Bank funds<br/>   •  £30 billion from the National Transformation Fund (up from £20 bn)<br/>   •  £50 billion in Barnett consequentials (up from £30bn)</blockquote>
      <p>He added: “In making this investment Labour is laying the foundations for a better, more just and fairer society where no-one is left behind and where every person is given the opportunities to lead a decent and fulfilling life.</p>
      <p>“This extra investment will provide the funding that Scottish Labour would use to build 120,000 new council and social homes, invest £6 billion in retrofitting homes to the highest energy efficiency standards, and bring dignity back to care workers and care users alike with a 25% increase in investment in social care.</p>
      <p>“This investment is the transformation that only a UK Labour government can make. This is the difference a UK Labour government can make to Scotland.”</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn is to unveil a “manifesto of hope” for the December 12 election to party supporters in Birmingham on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Mr Leonard added: “Back in 2014, many of those who campaigned and voted for independence did so because they saw it as an opportunity to challenge the failed status quo.</p>
      <p>“Now the SNP’s own blueprint for independence prescribes a decade of cuts in a separate Scottish state.</p>
      <p>“This is not a challenge to the status quo – it is a recipe for disaster, and a bid to turbocharge the failed austerity politics that Scotland has suffered for far too long already.</p>
      <p>“Under my leadership in Scotland, and Jeremy Corbyn’s across the UK, Labour is now offering the people of Scotland a chance to break free from the failed policies of the Tories in Westminster, and from the SNP’s cuts, which they would accelerate in a separate Scotland.”</p>
