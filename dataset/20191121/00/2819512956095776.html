        <b>Astronomers have investigated the nature of a very bright and long-duration gamma-ray burst, <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=GRB+190114C">GRB 190114C</a>, by studying its environment.</b>

      <p>Gamma-ray bursts are the most energetic explosions in the Universe, beaming out mighty jets which travel through space at 0.99 times the speed of light, as a star much more massive than our Sun collapses at the end of its life to produce a black hole.</p>
      <p>GRB 190114C was <a href="http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/polarized-radio-signal-gamma-ray-burst-07312.html">detected</a> by a suite of telescopes, including NASA’s Swift and Fermi telescopes, as well as by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov telescopes, on January 14, 2019.</p>
      <p>Some of the light detected from the object had the highest energy ever observed: 1 TeV (Tera electron volt) — about one trillion times as much energy per photon as visible light.</p>
      <p>Follow-up observations were made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to study the environment around GRB 190114C and find out how this extreme emission is produced.</p>
      <p>“Hubble’s observations suggest that this particular burst was sitting in a very dense environment, right in the middle of a bright galaxy 5 billion light years away. This is really unusual, and suggests that might be why it produced this exceptionally powerful light,” said Dr. Andrew Levan a researcher at Radboud University.</p>

      <p>The astronomers used Hubble, together with ESO’s Very Large Telescope and the Atacama Large Milimeter/submilimeter Array (ALMA), to study the host galaxy of GRB 190114C.</p>
      <p>They investigated whether the environmental properties of the host system, which is composed of a close pair of interacting galaxies, might have contributed to the production of these very-high-energy photons.</p>
      <p>GRB 190114C occurred within the nuclear region of a massive galaxy, a location that is rather unique.</p>
      <p>This is indicative of a denser environment than that in which gamma-ray bursts are typically observed and could have been crucial for the generation of the very-high-energy photons that were observed.</p>
      <p>“Scientists have been trying to observe very-high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts for a long time,” said Dr. Antonio de Ugarte Postigo, a scientist in the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía.</p>
      <p>“This new observation is a vital step forward in our understanding of gamma-ray bursts, their immediate surroundings, and just how matter behaves when it is moving at 99.999% of the speed of light.”</p>
