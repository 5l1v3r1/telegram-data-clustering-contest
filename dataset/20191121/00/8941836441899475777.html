      <p>ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) - North Carolina’s famed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cold-mountain/">Cold Mountain</a> is on fire.</p>
      <p>The Raleigh News &amp; Observer reported Thursday at a U.S. Forest Service video shows orange flames and white smoke along multiple spots on the mountain’s ridge.</p>
      <p>The mountain has been featured in a popular novel and an award-winning movie. Charles Frazier’s best-selling book “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cold-mountain/">Cold Mountain</a>” is about a Confederate soldier’s journey through western North Carolina. The book was later adapted into a 2003 movie starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger.</p>
      <p>The forest service didn’t release details on what might have caused the fire or where it started. The Shining Rock Wilderness area is temporarily closed because of the fire.</p>
      <p>The mountain is about 35 miles (56 kilometers) from the city of Asheville.</p>
