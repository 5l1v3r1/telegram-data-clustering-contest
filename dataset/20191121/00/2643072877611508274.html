      <h1>Real Reason We Voted Out PDP In Bayelsa – Alameisegha Family</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Faderera Falade</a></address>
      <p>Former Bayelsa State Governor, Chief <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/diepreye-alameisegha/"><u>Diepreye Alameisegha</u></a></b>‘s family has said that they are one of those who worked with other stakeholders to put an end to the reign of <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/pdp/"><u><b>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</b></u></a> in the state because the incumbent state Governor, <b>Seriake Dickson</b> disappointed the people of Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>The family who spoke under the auspices of <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/am/"><u><b>Alamcoism Movement(AM)</b></u></a>, said Dickson not only insulted the late Alameisegha, he also disrespected Ijaw elders in most of his dealings and utterances.</p>
      <p>The Director-General, of the Movement, Ziriworiten Alameisegha, lamented that the PDP abandoned the template of development and empowerment laid down by the late governor.</p>
      <p><i>“The PDP government disappointed Alameisegha’s family. The Alamcoism endorsed Seriake Dickson but at the end of the day what did he do? He disappointed the family, insulted Alamcoism. So, we decided that since he failed to respect elders, we should teach him a lesson”</i>, he said.</p>
      <p>Alameisegha, warned Lyon against breaking his social contract with the people.</p>
      <p>He called on Lyon to learn from the past governments, and stop listening to rumours.</p>
      <p>He further urged him to focus on human capital development to address the endemic poverty in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>Alameisegha further appealed to the governor-elect to pay attention to the infrastructural development of the state especially the construction of a seaport in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>He also called on Dickson and the PDP to shelve the idea of going to court to challenge the victory of Lyon saying instead of wasting the state money on litigation, they should channel the resources to infrastructural development.</p>
