      <h1>Fewer teachers plan to vote Labour than in the 2017 General Election</h1>
      <h2>A survey found that Labour remains the top choice among teachers, but their share of the vote has fallen, with the Liberal Democrats in second and the Tories third</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Ellis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-ellis/</a></address>
      <p>Fewer teachers plan to vote Labour in the General Election than in 2017, a poll reveals.</p>
      <p>Overall, 45% said they would back <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>’s party compared to the 53% who did last time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> remain their top choice, with the Lib Dems second and the Tories third, the survey of more than 11,000 found.</p>
      <p>At the last <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a>, 19% supported the Tories and the Lib Dems trailed on 15%. Now 22% say they will vote Lib Dem and just 14% say they will back the Conservatives.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> is a key issue, with 80% saying they voted to remain in the EU.</p>

      <p>It was the most influential factor in voting intention, with 36% saying it swayed them, the poll for education weekly Tes showed.</p>
      <p>This could explain the surge in support for the anti-Brexit Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>Asked which party they thought had the best policies on education, 45% said Labour, 13% said the Lib Dems and 10% said the Tories.</p>
