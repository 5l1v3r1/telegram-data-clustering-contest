      <h1>Don Lemon on CNN: It’s ‘mental’ to deny Trump did so</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>CNN primetime host Don Lemon said Wednesday that it’s “mental” for people to to still defend President Trump’s behavior during his July phone call with the Ukrainian president.</p>
      <p>“This was not a good day for the administration,” Mr. Lemon told fellow CNN anchor Chris Cuomo while discussing Ambassador Gordon Sondland’s testimony Wednesday in the impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump.</p>
      <p>“I have to say, at this point if you’re continuing to say that there was no, as they say, ‘quid pro quo,’ or the president didn’t ask, or whether or not it’s impeachable, that is, again, not up for me to decide, not up for you to decide, that’s up for the Senate to decide and the American people,” Mr. Lemon said. “But to deny that the president did not do something wrong, at this point it is…”</p>
      <p>“Political, that’s what it is,” Mr. Cuomo interjected.</p>
      <p>“No, I was going to say it’s mental,” Mr. Lemon continued. “It is mental. If you can look at the mountain of evidence and say, ‘Oh, nothing’s wrong, the president didn’t do anything wrong, he’s just rooting out corruption,’ you’ve got a problem because that is not what happened. The problem is you.”</p>

      <p>Mr. Lemon insisted on his show Tuesday that he’s “not a partisan” while he attacked Republicans for being “hypocritical” in their response to the phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows, even the people who are defending the president, that what he did on that call was not perfect, that what he did was wrong, they’re just trying to figure a defense and how to twist themselves in knots to come up with something,” he said.</p>

        <p>“The Republicans are on the wrong side of history, and they are the most hypocritical,” he added. “I’m not a partisan. I know people think that I’m some liberal Democrat. I’m not. They used to think I was a conservative Republican. I’m not. But I don’t think the Republicans aren’t serving themselves well right now with their defenses or lack thereof of a credible one.”</p>
