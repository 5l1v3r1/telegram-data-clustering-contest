      <h1>Majority of nations in UPR lauded Egypt's report on human rights: Min.</h1>

      <p>CAIRO - 21 November 2019: Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Omar Marwan said that Egypt's report of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) was endorsed by 80 percent of the countries that responded to it. <br/><br/>In an interview with DMC, Marwan said that 133 states responded to the report, noting that the states who gave a negative response used sharp terms, including "abuses" and "torture". <br/><br/>He asserted that the comments of the countries that dispraised the report were politically influenced. <br/><br/>Marwan said Egypt managed to abide by 92 percent of the recommendations of the last UPR, affirming that the recommendations do not mean any condemnation. <br/><br/>The minister also denied accusations of forcible disappearance that is allegedly carried out by the state, saying that such allegations are used for political purposes. <br/><br/>He added that some persons deliberately disappear to join the Islamic State (IS) or for any other reason. <br/><br/>Egypt has received positive international response, following submitting its Universal Periodic Review report on human rights, local media reported, except by Ankara, which has been known for hostile remarks against the Egyptian state. <br/><br/>This echos earlier reports saying that diplomatic responses to Egypt’s interactive dialogue on its human rights situation have reportedly thus far been positive at the UPR. <br/><br/>Egypt’s presentation was attended by many diplomatic and non-governmental delegations, as well as media outlets. <br/><br/>Only Turkey sent recommendation regarding the death of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, which is inconsistent with the statement issued by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, as only one state issued a recommendation on the issue, which indicates that its report was unprofessional and not based on facts. <br/><br/>Refuting doubts about the death of Morsi, Egyptian Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Omar Marwan has told AFP in an interview that Morsi's death took place naturally, during a trial. <br/><br/>“Morsi died in the courtroom in front of everybody,” Marwan told AFP, rejecting a statement issued last week by an independent panel of UN experts. <br/><br/>However, according to Marwan, the general prosecution is still investigating his death and will announce the results as soon as they are reached. <br/><br/>Morsi, who belonged to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was overthrown after a year in power following a popular uprising. <br/><br/>A number of 14 countries demanded that Egypt abolish the death penalty, during the final communiqué to discuss the Universal Periodic Review report submitted by Egypt to the UN Human Rights Council on human rights situation in the African country, local media reported. <br/><br/>They also called for amending legislations in line with international human rights standards concerning the death penalty.</p>
