      <h1>Reps Cry Out To Security Agencies Over Killings In Zamfara State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Faderera Falade</a></address>
      <p>Heads of relevant security agencies have been summoned over fresh attacks on some communities in Zamfara State, following a motion sponsored by Member representing Gummi/Bukkuyi Federal Constituency of Zamfara state, Hon. Sulieman Abubakar Gummi.</p>
      <p>While speaking with journalists after the plenary, Hon Gummi said Zamfara had enjoyed relative peace with booming marketing activities for the past 4 months, until the recent attacks.</p>
      <p>“<i>If you compare the previous 8 years with what is happening now, you’ll see that Zamfara is relatively peaceful because markets are now open. A lot of markets that have not been opened for a while are now open.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Zamfara Local government and other local governments that are not within the borders areas are witnessing peace. You can now travel at night from one local government to the other.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“Gummi/Bukkuyi, my constituency happens to border with Kebbi and Sokoto states and that is where the problem is”</i>, he said.</p>
      <p>Narrating the ugly incident that happened recently, where dozens of locals were unaccounted for, after the attacks of bandits,</p>
      <p>Hon. Gummi who narrated recent happenings in which dozens of locals went missing said, the bandit forced themselves into the houses of many families, while the bandits moved freely within the communities for days.</p>
      <p>He said “<i>These people move from the surrounding bushes, from Sokoto and Kebbi and we believe they came from those areas. They move in hundreds, almost 200 plus on motor circles.</i></p>
      <p>Gunmi said he was in Abuja and had just arrived from Lesotho with the Eagles when he got the first call that bandits in their 100s are attacking the villages.</p>
      <p>He said before he got to Sokoto, they had already attacked the villages.</p>
      <p>“<i>Every second, people were calling, they are heading to so and so location. They are coming from this point to that point. There seems to be good intel on their movement. They know, they are sleeping in so and so secondary school in so and so location.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“The next day they move and continue their attacks, they spent two nights in my constituency, that means there is good intel. If I can get the intel, I am sure the security operatives got the intel too. But why were they not intercepted? That is the question we should ask. That means something is going on.</i>
      </p>
      <p>He said the Bandits are particularly interested in a village called Karaye, explaining that they surrounded that location and destroyed the whole village.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“There is no house that is standing. And what they do is they push a family into a house and set it ablaze and you can’t come out. Once you come out they shoot you.</i>
      </p>
      <p>“<i>If you go to the hospital in Gummi right now you will see 3-year old with gunshot wounds on the leg. If you see the gory pictures from Karaye, you’ll weep. This is something we were seeing in the early advent of Boko Haram; this is what we saw there.</i></p>
      <p><i>“And next day, they attacked another village in the morning and killed about 12 people and left to the forest and they have now disappeared, we don’t know where they are, almost 200 or over 200 militias”,</i> Gummi lamented.</p>
