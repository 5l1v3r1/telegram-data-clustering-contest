      <p><b>Toffees’ </b>U-23 coach, David Unsworth, believes Dennis Adeniran has improved tremendously following his promotion to first-team training at Everton. Adeniran has worked with Marco Silva’s senior side for the entire campaign and despite not being included in a match-day squad, the U-23 manager is pleased with his development.</p>
      <p>“Without a doubt, certainly from a tactical point of view,” Unsworth replied when asked if he had noticed a marked progress in the 20-year-old.</p>
      <p>“He’s a great athlete and has got great power and pace but what we’ve tried to do is teach him the game defensively as a central midfielder.</p>
      <p>“That’s something with young players that takes a little bit of time.”</p>
      <p>“We’ve looked at areas to get him and he loves running with the ball,” Unsworth told <i>Liverpoolecho</i>.</p>
      <p>“There’s loads of development left in Dennis and loads of opportunities for him to get better. He’s another player that is a work in progress to get him in the first-team.”</p>
      <p>Prior to his promotion to the first team, Adeniran was a key player in the young Toffees’ double-winning campaign last term.</p>
