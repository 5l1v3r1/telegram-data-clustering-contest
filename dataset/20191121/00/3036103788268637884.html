      <h1>Showmax launches R49 mobile plan in South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/jamie-mckane" target="_blank">Jamie McKane</a></address>
      <p>MultiChoice has launched a new Showmax mobile-only plan in South Africa.</p>
      <p>At its Media Showcase event in Sandton, Johannesburg, the company said this new plan would be priced at R49 per month and would limit viewing to a single mobile device.</p>
      <p>Showmax has also partnered with Vodacom to offer a promotional monthly package for Vodacom customers.</p>
      <p>The promotion is priced at R99 per month and includes a mobile-only Showmax subscription with 2GB of mobile data every month.</p>
      <p>The Vodacom promotional plan will be billed through Vodacom and includes a Showmax Mobile monthly subscription and 2GB of Showmax mobile data per month.</p>
      <p>“This is all about an African service developing a solution that meets the needs of African consumers. Customer feedback consistently points to local content and sport as some of the things that people value most from Showmax,” said MultiChoice Connected Video CEO Niclas Ekdahl.</p>
      <p>“That’s of course on top of the international series, movies, and kids’ shows that are our bread and butter.”</p>
      <p>“With all of that content now available in a product designed specifically for mobile usage, we’re doing something no other service can offer,” Ekdahl said.</p>
      <h3>Mobile-only plan</h3>
      <p>Showmax’s mobile-only plan is now available for order from its website, along with the promotional Vodacom package.</p>
      <p>Mobile-only subscribers are able to watch on a smartphone or a tablet and can view one simultaneous stream across their account.</p>
      <p>Unlike standard subscribers, mobile-only users do not have access to Showmax’s HD streaming.</p>
      <p>The packages can be cancelled at any time and offer a 14-day free trial with recurring payment. Both the standard and mobile plans include live sport, sport magazine shows, and sport documentaries.</p>
