      <h1>A royal scandal</h1>

      <p>The prince is no stranger to controversy. Queen Elizabeth II’s second son has found himself mired in yet another scandal that has led to charitable partners and educational institutions distancing themselves from the British royal. <br/><br/>Prince Andrew, however, has denied an allegation that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured for him by his friend Jeffrey Epstein. US financier Epstein killed himself in a US prison in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The scandal has escalated since Andrew’s rambling denials and explanations in a disastrous TV interview aired recently. The prince denied sleeping with Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who says she was trafficked by Epstein and had sex with Andrew on three occasions, including twice when she was 17. <br/><br/>The prince attempted to do some damage control over speculation about his role in the Epstein scandal by granting an interview to Emily Maitlis, the presenter of the BBC’s Newsnight programme. But it backfired when he failed to show empathy for the young women who were exploited by Epstein even as he defended his friendship with the American financier. <br/><br/>While Andrew said he regretted staying at Epstein’s Manhattan home in 2010, after Epstein had served a prison sentence for a sex crimes conviction, Andrew defended his previous friendship with the billionaire investor because of the contacts it provided when he was preparing for a role as Britain’s special trade representative.</p>
