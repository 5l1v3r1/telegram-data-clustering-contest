        <b>New Tottenham coach, Jose Mourinho, was presented to the London team and was questioned about his 'Spurs' phrase when he was Chelsea manager, but he also sent a caring message to Mauricio Pochettino.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I come with a bit of sadness for his exit. Pochettino can come when he wants. When he misses the players, when he misses the people he works with. <b>The door is always open for him.</b>” He will find another great club and will have a great future," he explained.</p>
      <p>Mourinho told reporters that he had a good break: <b>"I was a little lost, but I did well</b>. I even learned to be an expert on television."</p>
      <p>Regarding his phrase ("I would never coach <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a>")m Mourinho stated that he said this "before being fired" from Chelsea. "Mr. Chelsea? I am <b>Mr. Porto and Mr. Real Madrid</b> and other clubs as well, I am whatever club I am at", he said.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he analysed his competitive gene and didn't blame anybody for his failures. "If you are happy by losing football matches,<b> it’s difficult to be a winner in any moment of your career. </b>I was always humble but it was in my way. The problem was that you didn’t understand that", he stated.</p>
