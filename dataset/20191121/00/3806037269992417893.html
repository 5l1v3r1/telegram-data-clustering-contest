      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:40:05+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:40</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Montes</a></address>
      <p>Towards the beginning of this month, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/alicia-keys">Alicia Keys</a> enlisted 21 Savage for the official remix of her Miguel-assisted single <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/alicia-keys-miguel-21-savage-show-me-love-remix-stream">“Show Me Love.”</a> Now, the award-winning songstress is back with another new track off her seventh — and currently untitled — studio album, “Time Machine. Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/music/2019/11/20/alicia-keys-time-machine-video-behind-the-scenes/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>, Keys said that “Time Machine” has the “feel” of a “skating song” to her.</p>
      <p>The release of the audio for Alicia Keys’ latest record is being accompanied by the introduction of its visual component, which was put together by director Art Johnson and Cole Cook — Alicia Keys’ brother — and features an appearance by Tiana Whack.</p>
      <p>“I think that, to be totally candid, I have for a long time been very afraid of being excellent,” Alicia Keys previously explained to us during a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/alicia-keys-show-me-love-film-interview">September interview</a>, opening up about her newfound connection to the visual side of her craft. “I just been ready to go to the next level in myself for a bit of a long time. And I don’t think I’ve ever given myself permission to actually do it .. I feel like it’s scary as sh*t to be who you <i>really</i> are. It just is. And it’s easier to kind of default to that one that works like, ‘If everybody knows me like this, Imma just do that.’ And then we’re growing and we’re trying to figure out, ‘Wait, why don’t I feel right in that space anymore?’ And I think it’s because we don’t give ourselves permission to be all the things we are.”</p>
