      <h1>Epstein boasted to teen model that Bill Clinton was his ‘best friend’: suit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:20:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:20</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Saul and Ben Feuerherd</a></address>
      <p>Multi-millionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein boasted to a young girl he allegedly sexual abused in the early 2000s that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/16/artist-who-painted-bill-clinton-in-dress-and-heels-had-no-idea-it-was-hanging-in-epsteins-mansion/">he and former President Bill Clinton</a> were “best friends,” according to a suit filed against his estate on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Epstein’s latest accuser — who is identified as “Mary Doe” in the federal suit — alleged that when she went to his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/jeffrey-epsteins-creepy-nyc-mansion-could-be-worth-100m/">Upper East Side townhouse</a> at the age of 16 in 2004, he showed her a photo that he had of Clinton.</p>
      <p>“Epstein told her that he and President Clinton were ‘best friends,'” the suit states.</p>
      <p>The girl, who came to the US from an unidentified war-torn nation as a refugee years earlier, told the sex criminal that Clinton’s policies made it possible for her and her family to settle in the US.</p>
      <p>“When Mary explained her family’s story, Epstein told her that he would personally thank ‘Bill’ on her and her family’s behalf,” the suit states.</p>
      <p>The woman alleges in the suit that Epstein sexually abused her a number of times when she was teenage model working and living in New York City.</p>
      <p>The abuse drove her to suicidal thoughts and depression, according to the suit. She also alleges that Epstein’s alleged “fixer,” Sarah Kellen, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/10/meet-jeffrey-epsteins-gang-of-accused-slave-recruiters/">aided and abetted the abuse</a> by scheduling her visits to the townhouse and witnessing Epstein force her to perform oral sex on him.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Clinton has repeatedly denied the former president had any knowledge of the abuse carried out by Epstein.</p>
      <p>A rep for Kellen could not be reached on Wednesday. Lawyers for Epstein’s estate also did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
