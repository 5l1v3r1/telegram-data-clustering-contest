      <p>Joining them at the recording that will take place at Family of God (FOG) Auditorium in Bulawayo next Saturday will be Gwanda’s Destiny Life Ministries Church choir and Vocal Ex.</p>
      <p>This will be Mdlongwa’s first recording after he went solo last year and successfully released his six-track gospel EP titled <i>Isabelo Sami</i>.</p>
