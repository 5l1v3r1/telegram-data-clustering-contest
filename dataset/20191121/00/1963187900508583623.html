      <p>CAIRO – 21 November 2019: Liverpool Egyptian winger, Mohamed Salah, will not be able to support his team when they travel to London to face Crystal Palace at the English Premier League according to Sky Sports sources. <br/><br/>The player suffered an injury during the game against Manchester City and he left the pitch to follow the last minutes of his team’s 3-1 victory over the defending champions from the bench. <br/><br/>Salah’s injury forced him to miss Egypt’s first two games at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifiers against Kenya and Comoros in which the Egyptians failed to achieve their first victory at the Qualifiers. <br/><br/>Egypt started their campaign in Alexandria with a 1-1 draw while the second game in Comoros ended with a goalless draw. <br/><br/>Belgium striker Divock Origi is expected to replace Salah and share Liverpool’s attacking line with Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino. <br/><br/>Liverpool players aim to continue their amazing run at the league against a tough opponent like Palace in front of their passionate fans. <br/><br/>Liverpool are leading the league table with 34 points, eight points ahead of Leicester City and Chelsea who share the second place.</p>
