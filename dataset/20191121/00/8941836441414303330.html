      <h1>Man shot by police in struggle on tarmac at Vegas airport</h1>

      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - Las Vegas police shot a man who fought with officers, including one who was knocked unconscious, before dawn Thursday on the tarmac near a terminal at McCarran International Airport, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The wounded intruder and the injured officer were hospitalized after the incident about 4 a.m. in a restricted area outside the boarding gates of the main terminal serving domestic airlines, police Capt. Nichole Splinter said.</p>
      <p>The names of the wounded man and the officers were not immediately made public. The injured officer was treated and released, said Officer Aden OcampoGomez, a department spokesman.</p>
      <p>Police encountered the man outside Terminal 1 about 20 minutes after officers investigated an alarm indicating that someone went through a security door at a separate passenger building, Terminal 3, Splinter said. Officers did not initially find anyone, she said.</p>
      <p>The man became “extremely irate” and attacked the officers while he was being escorted in custody to a public area of the airport near Terminal 1, Splinter said.</p>

      <p>One officer was knocked unconscious and one officer tried using a less-than-lethal device to subdue the man before the third officer fired twice, Splinter said. Police did not immediately disclose whether the officer used a stun gun, baton or other device before shots were fired.</p>
      <p>Splinter said the wounded man underwent surgery at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Cellphone video taken by person who was apparently in Terminal 1, aired by KVVU-TV in Las Vegas, shows three police officers around a man sitting handcuffed on the well-lit tarmac. It does not show a struggle or the shooting.</p>
      <p>OcampoGomez said police believe the man who was apprehended was the same person who entered the secure area at Terminal 3. It did not appear he had a weapon and it was not immediately clear if he was a traveler, OcampoGomez said.</p>

        <p>The officers were equipped with body-worn cameras and OcampoGomez said the details of the struggle would be made public along with the names of the officers and the wounded man in coming days.</p>
        <p>Airport operations and flights were not affected, McCarran spokesman Chris Jones said.</p>
        <p>Terminal 3 primarily serves international flights and would have been quiet at the time, Jones said.</p>
        <p>A paved causeway over a sunken airport access road connects the terminals, serving as a taxiway and connector for baggage carts and airport vehicles. The route passes by the Federal Aviation Administration’s airport traffic control tower.</p>
        <p>FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said the investigation was being handled by local authorities.</p>
        <p>OcampoGomez said police did not know how the man got between the two buildings.</p>
