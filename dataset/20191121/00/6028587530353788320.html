      <h1>What Fintech Can Do For Healthcare</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">William A. Haseltine</a></address>
      <p>In most countries, the process of paying for health coverage is not just costly, but complicated, stressful, and time consuming. It also prohibits people from accessing care.If exorbitant prescription drug prices and out of pocket expenses were not already enough, healthcare consumers must also navigate payment systems known for their obscurity and susceptibility to error. These systems not only overwhelm current users, but also discourages new ones from finding the coverage that is right for them.</p>
      <p>The relationship between a healthcare consumer and their healthcare financing should not—and does not—have to be so fraught. As health services becoming increasingly digital, more opportunities open up for companies to stage data driven interventions that can modernize, and hopefully revitalize, our fragmented healthcare networks.</p>
      <p>Such is the aim of fintech, or financial technology, that brings new and improved digital financial service models into the healthcare space. Fintech companies are leveraging powerful innovations blockchain, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to eliminate the inefficiencies and knowledge gaps endemic to most healthcare payment plans. With few exceptions, what unites them all is their ability to streamline the flow of information and money between patients and providers—and in doing so, save everyone involved precious time and effort.</p>
      <p>Mobile based health savings accounts, low interest loans, and remittances used specifically for healthcare are examples of payment oriented fintech solutions, which increase the access and affordability of care for low to moderate income populations that might otherwise be difficult to reach. Meanwhile data oriented fintech solutions, which simplify the health payment process for all users, use technology to process healthcare data in greater quantities and at greater speeds.</p>
      <p>Blockchain based fintech platforms like <a href="https://enterprise.gem.co/gemos/">GemOS</a>, for instance, give healthcare networks a shared digital infrastructure that makes data sharing more reliable and secure. That shared knowledge base can be augmented by artificial intelligence tools like <a href="https://www.dreamquark.com/">DreamQuark</a>, which use deep learning algorithms to automate data processing and generate recommendations accordingly. By maximizing the clinical knowledge and decision making capabilities of providers and insurance companies, both solutions combined give much needed resources back to patient engagement.</p>
      <p>Patient satisfaction is, after all, a nonnegotiable requirement for fintech success. The phrase “patient centric” appears frequently in descriptions for products targeting healthcare consumers and providers alike, making a direct appeal to organizations that want to do better by the people they serve. Simplee, a data driven platform that tailors health payment options to match patient preferences, even <a href="https://www2.simplee.com/company/about-simplee/">proclaims itself</a> the “founder of the patient financial care movement,” proudly declaring “power to the patients.”</p>
      <p>The heavy emphasis on patient engagement is no mere marketing strategy. Patient centered care, according to the GemOS website, is the “model of the future”—a future in which healthcare networks, like finance companies, compute large amounts of data to fulfill specific individual needs. In restoring a sense of agency, choice, and value to healthcare consumers, personalized payment plans help rebuild trust between them and their providers.</p>
      <p>Looking beyond the United States to countries abroad, the relationship between poor healthcare financing and poor health outcomes becomes even more apparent. In Southeast Asia, rising healthcare costs have driven the household incomes of 65 million people below the poverty line, impoverishing millions more each year. As with any emergent healthcare solution, implementing strong fintech platforms will require extensive research, public private partnerships and good governance to reach the patients who need them most. Healthcare fintech is a frontier with plenty of room for improvement—which is why its trajectory is worth following.</p>
