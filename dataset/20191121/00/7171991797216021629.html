      <h1>Gaze Deeply Into These Infinity Mirror Coasters</h1>

      <p>Infinity mirrors have been gaining in popularity recently, thanks in no small part to the availability of low-cost RGB LED strips to line them with. Generally such pieces are limited to wall art, or the occasional table build, which is what makes these <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Infinity-Mirror-Coaster/">infinity mirror drink coasters from [MnMakerMan] so unique</a>.</p>

      <p>Built from an ATtiny85 and a WS2812B LED strip nestled into a 3D printed enclosure, these coasters are relatively cheap and easy to assemble should you want to run a few off before the holiday party season. [MnMakerMan] mentions the LEDs can consume a decent amount of energy, so he’s included a module to allow recharging of the internal 3.7 V 1500 mAh battery over USB.</p>
      <p>Of course, a couple of PLA pieces and a custom PCB doesn’t make an infinity mirror. To achieve the desired effect, he’s created a stack consisting of a 4″ glass mirror, a 1/8″ thick plexiglass disc, and one-way mirror tint film. The WS2812B strip mounted along the circumference lights up the void between the two surfaces, and produces a respectable sense of depth that can be seen in the video after the break.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first high-tech piece of surface protection we’ve seen around these parts, as some<a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/08/05/supercap-drink-coasters-are-the-life-of-the-party/"> very nice wirelessly charged supercapacitor coasters</a> were entered into the 2019 Hackaday Prize. Of course, if you’re of the opinion that coasters should remain as cheap as possible, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/12/28/coasty-the-coaster-toaster/">we’ve seen a number of automated attempts</a> to <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/12/26/make-an-impression-at-the-bar-with-a-cnc-coaster-plotter/">add some flair to the classic paperboard discs</a>.</p>
