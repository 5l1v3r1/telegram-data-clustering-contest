        <b>Barça is looking for a replacement for Luis Suarez. One of the names in the list would be Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. According to French media, the Catalan team follows the Arsenal player very closely.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/p-aubameyang-101801/">Aubameyang </a>could end up in <b>Barça</b>. The club presided by Josep Maria Bartomeu is reportedly keeping a close eye on the Gabonese player, according to 'Le10Sport'.</p>
      <p>According to this source, Aubameyang has a privileged place in Barcelona's agenda, as the Arsenal striker has been one of the team's targets for a while. </p>

      <p>However, Aubameyang is still not number one the list of priorities. The favourite to become Luis Suarez's successor would be Inter Milan's <b>Lautaro Martinez</b>.</p>
      <p>In any case, Barça has more than one option, Aubameyang among them, but his age could become an issue. He is 30 years old, <b>only two years younger than Luis Suarez</b>. Therefore, he would <b>not be a signing for the long term future.</b></p>
      <p>According to 'El Chiringuito', Barça follows Aubameyang closely. So much so that it wouldn't be ruled out that <b>he could become a January signing</b>. In France also point to this possibility.</p>
