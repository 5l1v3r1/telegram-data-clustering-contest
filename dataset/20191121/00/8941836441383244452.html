      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - The young <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">New York Rangers</a> showed just how well they can do when they play smart and limit mistakes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/artemi-panarin/">Artemi Panarin</a> scored twice, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/henrik-lundqvist/">Henrik Lundqvist</a> stopped 30 shots and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">Rangers</a> beat the short-handed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Washington Capitals</a> 4-1 Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>“I think that was one of our better efforts as of late,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/henrik-lundqvist/">Lundqvist</a> said. “A big part of their success is their power play, so the key really is to stay out of the box. … Us being disciplined is a huge part of this win.”</p>
      <p>Pavel Buchnevich had a goal and an assist, Brett Howden also scored and Kaapo Kakko added two assists for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">Rangers</a>, who ended a two-game skid and improved to 6-3-1 in their last 10 games.</p>
      <p>“This was a true team effort,” coach David Quinn said. “Hank was really good in the net. I thought we defended well, we didn’t give up a lot of crazy chances, we did some really good things offensively, the power play was good and we had a big kill.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/henrik-lundqvist/">Lundqvist</a> earned his 454th win, tying Curtis Joseph for fifth on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a>’s career list.</p>
      <p>“It’s an honor to be in that company,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/henrik-lundqvist/">Lundqvist</a> said. “There’s so many really great guys (on the list). A lot of them have been an inspiration to me growing up. … It means a lot to me. It really does.”</p>
      <p>Evgeny Kuznetsov scored and Braden Holtby made 27 saves for first-place Washington, which lost in regulation for the second time in four games after an 11-0-2 stretch. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a>, who hit iron four times in the first two periods, failed to earn a point for only the fourth time in 24 games, including the second time in 13 on the road.</p>
      <p>“We’ve obviously found different ways to win,” coach Todd Rierden said. “Tonight there were some opportunities. We beat the goalie a few times and it’s an inch off from going in the net. Maybe that’s a different game for us when we get rolling a little bit.”</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> played without suspended right wing Garnet Hathaway and injured center Nicklas Backstrom.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/artemi-panarin/">Panarin</a> made it 2-0 with his second power-play goal of the night on a rebound of Kakko’s shot from the left side for his 11th at 3:57 of the third period.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/artemi-panarin/">Panarin</a>, signed to a big free-agent deal in the offseason, knows he is being counted on to provide the scoring punch the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">Rangers</a> lacked since they went into rebuilding mode in February 2018.</p>
        <p>“I feel I have more responsibility but I try not to think about it,” he said through a translator. “When you think about it, it just gets in the way. The most important thing is we won and we beat a really good team.”</p>
        <p>While <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/artemi-panarin/">Panarin</a>’s goal was being announced, Buchnevich beat Holtby on the right side off a cross-crease pass from Filip Chytil for his third just 23 seconds later.</p>
        <p>Kuznetsov scored from the right circle on a power play at 7:24 for his 10th.</p>
        <p>Howden beat Holtby on the blocker side from in front for his third with 6 1/2 minutes remaining to restore the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">Rangers</a>’ three-goal lead.</p>
        <p>“They make it 3-1, and then we make it 4-1, and that’s a great sign,” Quinn said. “We’ve all talked about us managing our emotions and managing the ebbs and flows of a hockey game. I thought we did a really good job of that tonight.”</p>
        <p>New York’s Brendan Lemieux and Washington’s Tom Wilson fought with 3 1/2 minutes to go, after Wilson ran into Lemieux while he was being hit by Alex Ovechkin near the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a>’ bench.</p>
        <p>Washington pulled Holtby for an extra skater with more than three minutes left but couldn’t score.</p>
        <p>With the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">Rangers</a> still on a power play that carried over from the final minute of the first period, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/artemi-panarin/">Panarin</a> got a pass from Kakko in the left circle and fired it past Holtby’s glove side at 1:14 of the second. That extended <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/artemi-panarin/">Panarin</a>’s point streak to a career-high 12 games.</p>
        <p>After making 10 saves in the first period, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/henrik-lundqvist/">Lundqvist</a> had 14 in the second and was helped out by a post for the fourth time when Lars Eller’s shot clanged off iron during Washington’s power play about 7 1/2 minutes into the middle period.</p>
        <p>NOTES: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/artemi-panarin/">Panarin</a> has seven goals and 19 points during his streak. He also has eight goals and 12 points in 14 career games against Washington. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/henrik-lundqvist/">Lundqvist</a> appeared in his 869th regular-season game, breaking a tie with Grant Fuhr for 10th on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a>’s career list. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">Rangers</a> C Mika Zibanejad missed his 10th straight game due to an upper body injury. … The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> won the first meeting this season, 5-2 at home on Oct. 18. The teams also play March 5 back at Madison Square Garden and March 26 in Washington. … Referee Furman South was hit in the face by the puck on a clearing attempt by Ovechkin with 9 1/2 minutes left in the first period. South was down on the ice for several minutes and tended to by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">Rangers</a>’ medical staff. He stayed in the game and received five stitches during the first intermission.</p>
