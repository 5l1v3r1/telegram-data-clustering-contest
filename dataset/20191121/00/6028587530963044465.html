      <p>Let’s face it, if you’re a seasoned traveler (or even an infrequent one), airline travel isn’t something you look forward to. Do a quick search on your social networks and look for connections raving about how much they love the process. I’m guessing you’re much more likely to find customer-service sob stories.Most airlines are finally starting to<a href="http://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2016/06/21/twitter-customer-service-travel/"> make the jump to social</a> to connect with travelers and personalize their journeys, because in the age of customer experience, passengers are incredibly quick to go online and let airlines know when they’re unhappy. After all, customer interaction is one of the top three factors passengers take into account when choosing an airline.</p>
      <p>As fares continue to rise and the perception of customer service and convenience is rated at an all­-time low, a perfect storm of bottom­line instability has been brewing in the industry for years. Rather than remaining loyal to a favorite airline, customers are more likely to search out the best deals via the web and book their flights accordingly.</p>
      <p>So, what does it take to keep a customer in this age of competitive pricing and the ability to book with any airline at any time, day or night?</p>
      <h3>Connecting the moments that matter most</h3>
      <p>The first time my youngest child traveled by air, her excitement about the journey was palpable. (The enthusiasm levels of myself and my eldest daughter were significantly less.)</p>
      <p>At that point in time, I didn’t have an allegiance to any airline and was dreading traveling over the Thanksgiving holiday. The night before we left, I peeked in at her as she slept. She was clutching a note to her beloved fairies, letting them know we were going on vacation, but that we’d be back. Inspiration struck, and I wrote a note to whoever the person was that I’d meet at the airline desk when we arrived in the morning.</p>
      <p>Once at our gate, I approached the counter, letter in hand, apologizing for the request during such a busy time, saying if they couldn’t assist, I completely understood, then handed it to the woman at the American Airlines desk.</p>
      <p>In the note, I explained it was my daughters first time flying, that she believed her fairies granted us the vacation, and that she couldn’t wait to go. I asked if a crew member could visit her once on board to let her know that a fairy had been spotted nearby.</p>
      <p>It was a long shot, but as a parent, you come to realize that you have a very limited window to create magic for your child, and so when those chances arrive, it’s a matter of throwing yourself into the opportunity.</p>
      <h3>Personalization + Customer Service = Brand Loyalty</h3>
      <p>Once boarding started, I began coming to terms with the reality that this wasn’t one of those moments. The flight was full, running late, and many passengers had a connection to make in Chicago. The captain announced several times that we were a little behind as travelers began flagging the crew down, asking about gate locations and how quickly they could reach them.</p>
      <p>Then, a glimmer of hope: A message from the captain hinted that we’d picked up speed, as though there were some sort of magic assisting, and that we’d arrive in Chicago on time‚ close to the wire—but on time.</p>
      <p>My daughter looked at me and whispered, “<i>The fairies!</i>” There are moments I recall when I need to remember that there is good in the world. Her face in that instant is one of them.</p>
      <p>With about 15 minutes remaining before landing, again we heard from the captain, who conveyed the following, “<i>I do want to make a special announcement. As you can tell earlier today, we had a little magic working in our favor. That magic was actually a message that came across that said some fairies are helping to guide us along our way. More specifically, the message was to a young passenger on board today…</i>”</p>
      <p>He told the passengers where my daughter was sitting, and when she peeked her head up, they started clapping and giving her thumbs-up signs. There were smiles all around and, I confess, some tears from me and at least one other woman that I made eye contact with. As we departed, a stewardess handed us a note that’s now framed: </p>

      <h3>It doesn’t take magic to stand out from the competition</h3>
      <p>Do you remember the last time anyone or anything—let alone an airline—made you feel that all was right with the world? What price would you pay to do business with a company that provided that kind of experience?</p>
      <p>More importantly, what would it take for you <i>NOT</i> to do business with a company that provided that kind of experience?</p>
      <p>Since that flight, I’m traveling more frequently, and have remained solidly loyal to American, staying overnight and waiting hours to fly with them versus a competitor when running into weather issues or scheduling delays. Despite any inconvenience, I’ll always remain their customer thanks to that moment - there’s nothing that I’ve found that overcomes that experience.</p>
      <p>While every flight or travel moment cannot be personalized like ours, they can be tailored to acknowledge people as individuals. A collection of social handles and <a href="https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2018/11/26/how-a-living-profile-builds-customer-trust/">complete customer profiles</a> that allow customized messaging to customers would be an easy way to let passengers know they’re seen beyond a price point.</p>
      <p>Imagine American Airlines responding to me or my daughter when we tweet about our next journey, saying something like, <i>“Looking forward to seeing you soon. Are you bringing the magic fairies along?”</i></p>
      <p>Adding digital to the in-person experience is an extremely powerful combination, one that would encourage any traveler to remain faithful to that brand.</p>
      <p>After all, it wasn’t magic that made me loyal to American Airlines, it was in-the-moment personalization, customer service, and incredible people—no fairies or pixie dust needed.</p>
