        <b>New Ghana FA Cup Committee chairman Wilson Arthur claims he best fits the job and has promised to improve the knockout competition.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The media mogul believes his marketing background and acumen will be a major boot</p>
      <p>"I've served Eleven wise as chairman, I brokered the MTN sponsorship for Kotoko, the division one league sponsor in the erstwhile administration was secured by me. I own a club, Skyy FC and has a FIFA standard pitch, I have invested so much in the game too,'' he told Kumasi FM.</p>
      <p>''I was employed as a consultant for the 2015 MTN FA Cup final between Kotoko and Medeama by MTN, which has been the best so far.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure the good works I did with Mr Kurt Okraku then has earned me this position. He has a lot of trust in me and I promise I won't disappoint. I'm a marketing person and know how to build a brand, we will raise the standard he reached.''</p>
      <p>"Sponsorship for the FA Cup will be enormous in my tenure because I have the records. The FA Cup has a brand and I will build upon the good works of Mr Okraku, I will do everything within my means to lift the standard from where he left it."</p>
      <p>"I admit I'm a busy person but I will delegate most of the duties since we are many but the assurance is that we will deliver."</p>
      <p>Arthur will have Kofi Poku as Vice Chairman of the Committee with George Ofosuhene, Robert Duncan/Salifu Zida (depending on Executive Council election result), Oloboi Commodore, Frederick Agbenyo and Donne Komako serving as members.</p>
