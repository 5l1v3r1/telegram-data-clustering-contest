      <p>Apple has released iOS 13.3 Public Beta 3 for all Public Beta participants. However, with yet another iOS 13 hotfix released earlier this week, iOS 13.2.3, I have to wonder what exactly we're supposed to be testing at this point.iOS 13.2.3 brought with it performance improvements and bug fixes. This is great! Everyone wants less bugs and more performance! However, with these frequent minor iOS updates, the teeth have been taken out of the iOS 13.3 release, which was already sapped by last week's iOS 13.2.2 emergency release that fixed the multitasking issue. </p>
      <h3>What's New</h3>
      <p>Per the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_ipados_release_notes/ios_ipados_13_3_beta_3_release_notes">official release notes</a>, there's nothing new in iOS 13.3 Public Beta 3 that we haven't seen already. If last week's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2019/11/12/ios-133-public-beta-2-gives-us-the-most-secure-safari-ever/">iOS 13.3 Public Beta 2</a> was hiding the performance improvements that were shipped last week, Apple didn't let us know about it. </p>
      <p>So let's take a look at the few things we <i>do</i> know about.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In Screen Time there's a new <b>Communication Limits</b> setting. Instead of just setting time limits, you can specify who can be contacted. </li>
        <li>Don't like Memojis? Tired of seeing the Memoji keyboard next to your emoji keyboard? Now you can turn it off in <b>Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Memoji Stickers</b>.</li>
        <li>If you use physical security keys to make sure no one can access your stuff but you, Safari now supports Lightning, USB, and NFC physical security keys.  </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's Broken</h3>
      <p>Still nothing to talk about in the broken column for iOS 13.3, but that can all change with a single release. Stay alert and log any bugs you find. </p>
      <h3>What's Fixed</h3>
      <p>Unless iOS 13.3 Public Beta 3 is hiding more fixes that will be made public next week in yet another emergency point release, there's nothing of note in the fixed colum.</p>
      <h3>What's Next</h3>
      <p>With all the minor point during the iOS 13.3 beta, this has turned out to be a dud of a cycle. Not only does it leave testers wondering what, exactly, they're supposed to be testing, the frequent releases have to be testing developer endurance.</p>
      <p>There's a case to be made for making the public suffer for a little bit rather than push out constant iterative releases. It gives everyone, testers and developers alike, time to make sure a release is bug free. And it also keeps users on the same page. Between the four iOS 13 devices in my house right now, I can guarantee you that at least one of them has missed the latest update (or two). For a company that prides itself on near-universal OS adoption, it's a befuddling policy. </p>
      <p>I'm hoping that there will be a stronger focus and purpose for next month's iOS 13.4 Public Beta. Given that there's not much left to test in iOS 13.3, I fully expect it to be released next week before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. </p>
