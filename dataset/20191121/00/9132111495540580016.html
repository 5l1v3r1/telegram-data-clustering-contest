      <p>The NDC today skipped the 5th dialogue meant to tackle the roadmap to end political vigilantism in the country.</p>
      <p>The meeting, facilitated by the Peace council, was necessitated by president Nana Akufo-Addo-Addoâ€™s call on leadership of the two main political parties to help find a lasting solution to the menace.</p>
      <p>However not a single member from the opposition party was found present today during the meeting meant to discuss ways to end the utilization of these groups in the country</p>
      <p>With support from technical experts and the two main political parties(NDC, NPP), peace council welcomed the decision to present a working document on the said roadmap following reports from stakeholders at earlier meetings.</p>
