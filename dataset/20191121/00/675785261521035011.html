      <p>The beauty icon's new venture has come just weeks after she split with Danny Williams, 21.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the new signing, an Elite representative said: "Elite London are proud to sign Jourdan Riane to their board.</p>

      <p>"We're very excited about the future with Jourdan."</p>
      <p>Jourdan and Danny met in the villa during 2019's series of Love Island and became one of the quickest couples to go official.</p>
      <p>They even moved in together, but have since split because of "lack of respect, disloyalty and dishonesty."</p>

      <p>"I have to respect me first," Jourdan wrote, "I genuinely had such a great time in my relationship and I don't regret the decisions I've made as far as choosing to give someone a chance however, I have boundaries.</p>
