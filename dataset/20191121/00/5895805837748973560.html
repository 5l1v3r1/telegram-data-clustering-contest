      </p>
      <p>I was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer in early July after a colonoscopy I had put off for three years. I am a 67-year-old happily married man with two adult children. I’ve been a practicing clinical psychologist and psychotherapist for forty years. Throughout the four decades of my work treating patients in a variety of settings, settling for the past 20 years in a successful private practice North of Boston, I provide individual, couple and group <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy">psychotherapy</a>. I also teach group therapy at a local graduate school and do <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/forensic-therapy">forensic</a> evaluations in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma">trauma</a> cases.</p>
      <p>Ironically, my wife Felice and I were at Kripalu, a yoga and health mecca in Lenox, attending workshops and enjoying “R and R” when my symptoms became unavoidable. I had been having these symptoms for a while which interfered with my bowel routine. We believed these symptoms were related to food allergies or gluten intolerance (I had a history of celiac disease as a young child) and I had changed my <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/diet">diet</a> but symptoms still persisted. The day after our return to Boston, I had a colonoscopy I had scheduled. I was convinced results would resemble the last one 13 years before, which were clean. How was it possible, my dismissive, avoidant part claimed, that results could be anything but as I was so fit and healthy and physically invincible? When the doctor sat us down and told us that there was a “moderate to large” sized tumor above my rectum and he was 95% certain it was malignant, the earth moved off its axis, life changed in a New York minute, and we were catapulted into this alien world that I did not recognize, appreciate, or could fathom.</p>
      <p>It was surreal; another dimension had opened and I had been sucked into a black hole. I was on the other side of my life looking back at my happy, rewarding and productive life and could not reach the portal and return to my life as known. I was stuck in this new reality. In this shock phase and overwhelmed, I remember so clearly Felice holding me, looking directly into my eyes and declaring, “I will be there with you every step of the way. You will not be alone in this journey and we will get through it together.”</p>
      <p>Fighting cancer is a full-time job; especially in the early stages. It is not an exaggeration that its consuming, existentially threatening and symptoms (of colorectal cancer) are exceedingly unpleasant, painful, and potentially humiliating. A comprehensive, multi-modal, western/eastern medicine and mind/body approach is needed to combat this scourge. Besides IFS therapy, I do a number of adjunctive treatments and activities which I believe strengthen my own inherent healing capacity and immune system. These include acupuncture, Chinese medicine, diet, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/meditation">meditation</a>, yoga, and a healthy dose of exercise and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sport-and-competition">sports</a>. Social support and the secure <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attachment">attachment</a> of my primary relationship has been crucial in coping and recovery. The treatment for my particular form of colorectal cancer is arduous and tripartite: chemotherapy, radiation, capped off with surgery to dissect and then reconnect the bowel. A colostomy bag is in place as the bowel heals before reconnection. Survival clearly comes with a price; there has never been a doubt that I will pay, but I don’t have to like it.</p>
      <p>The posts to follow will be my journey through cancer in the form of these updates.</p>
