      <p>The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has warned Biafrans and members of his group that picking up arms will not ensure the actualization of the sovereign state of Biafra.</p>
      <p>Naija News reports that the IPOB leader made this statement during a live broadcast on Radio Biafra recently.</p>
      <p>Kanu said the mistake previous Biafra agitators made was to pick up arms, noting that this led to their failures and he (Kanu) will not repeat same mistake.</p>
      <p>The secessionist leader maintained that IPOB members cannot pick up arms without preparation.</p>
      <p>Kanu warned that should IPOB members and Biafrans go to “war now without meeting the necessary people, and important government of the world”, the Nigerian government “will just tag us rebels, terrorists.”</p>
      <p>His words: “When you keep asking what are we doing ? what are we doing ? You think Biafra will just come when you pick up arms unprepared? This is why we failed before and I Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB shall not repeat the same mistake.</p>
      <p>“If we go to war now without meeting the necessary people, and important government of the world, the zoo will just tag us rebels, terrorists and with their influence and wealth, the international communities shall buy into that deceit to join and carry out a second genocide against our people as they did in 1967- 70.</p>
      <p>“Do you know that the zoo has already bought off all the major mainstream media of the world not to discuss Biafra in their platforms.</p>
      <p>“Do you see why I always reverence his Excellency Late General Chukwu Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu for withstanding the world in a defensive battle for 30 months? He is greatest indeed but IPOB is here to complete that mission and we shall surely come out victorious because Chukwuokike has mandated us for this very divine mission,” he added.</p>
