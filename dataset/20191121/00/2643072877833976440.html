      <h1>Anthony Joshua Speaks On Andy Ruiz Jnr. Beating Him Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Faderera Falade</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/anthony-joshua/"><u><b>Anthony Joshua</b></u></a> has said the first defeat he faced with <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/andy-ruiz-jr/"><u>Andy Ruiz Jr</u></a></b>. was because he lacked experience, adding that he had become a “smarter” fighter ahead of December’s rematch.</p>
      <p>Recall Mexican-American Ruiz had defeated Joshua, the previously undefeated world heavyweight champion with a seventh-round stoppage at New York’s Madison Square Garden in June.</p>
      <p><i>“It wasn’t burnout. The issues I faced in the last camp, it’s just down to lack of experience. Even though it was at a high level, we were still finding experience. Andy Ruiz is good but I don’t think he should beat me twice</i>.</p>
      <p><i>I used to hear guys say you have to take a loss and I would think ‘why’? Now I can understand it and know what it takes. I have more understanding now and my ears are open to new information so that’s making me smarter as a fighter,”</i> Joshua said while speaking with newsmen in a new interview.</p>
      <p>The WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight title rematch dubbed the<i> ‘Clash on the Dunes’</i>, is set to take place in Saudi Arabia on December 7 after former Olympic Champion Joshua triggered a rematch clause.</p>
      <p><i>“The blessing is I have a second chance and here we are,”</i> the 30-year-old said.</p>
