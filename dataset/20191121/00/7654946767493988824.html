      <h1>What’s coming in Thursday’s impeachment hearings</h1>

      <p>The House Intelligence Committee will wrap up a marathon week of impeachment hearings on Thursday with the testimony of Fiona Hill and David Holmes — who could be the final witnesses to appear.</p>
      <p>Holmes, a State Department official, said he overheard a July call between Trump and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/behind-gordon-sondlands-rise-to-wealth-and-prominence/">Ambassador Gordon Sondland</a> where the president asked about whether Ukraine would do the investigations.</p>
      <p>Hill, a former White House Russia expert and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/adam-schiff-blocks-republicans-attempts-to-question-impeachment-witnesses/">Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman</a>’s previous supervisor, relayed concerns she and former National Security Adviser John Bolton had with the Ukrainian investigations Trump wanted.</p>
      <p>No more public hearings or private closed-door depositions are scheduled, as lawmakers are slated to be out next week for the Thanksgiving break.</p>
      <p>Spokespeople for the House Intelligence Committee declined to say whether the public phase of their inquiry is now closed.</p>
      <p>And Republicans aren’t expecting any more <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/sinclair-broadcast-group-skips-out-on-impeachment-hearings/">TV testimony</a> at this time, but cautioned they don’t know what else Democrats may have up their sleeves.</p>
      <p>Recesses haven’t stopped impeachment investigators from holding closed-door depositions in the past.</p>
      <p>Democrats, however, may want to avoid a prolonged legal fight with witnesses who have refused to appear and move forward with the evidence they’ve already gathered against Trump.</p>
      <p>In order for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/devin-nunes-spars-with-adam-schiff-calls-impeachment-probe-a-drug-deal/">impeachment to proceed</a>, Rep. Adam Schiff’s House Intelligence Committee must pass the baton to the House Judiciary Committee, headed by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-Manhattan). Nadler’s committee would formulate the articles of impeachment and take a vote on which would then go to the full House for a vote.</p>
