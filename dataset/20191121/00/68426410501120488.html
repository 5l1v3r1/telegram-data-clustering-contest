        <b>Deputy PM Freeland to oversee relations with U.S. and provinces in Trudeau’s new cabinet</b>
      </p>
      <p>Justin Trudeau is leaning heavily on one of his <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-deputy-pm-freeland-to-oversee-relations-with-us-and-provinces-in/">star performers from his last cabinet, Chrystia Freeland,</a> as he seeks to promote national unity, improve relations with China and address concerns over environmental and economic policies that cost the Liberals their majority. Praising Ms. Freeland’s work as foreign affairs minister during the trade talks, the Prime Minister described her as a trusted confidant who will take the lead in attempting to quell anger in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where not a single Liberal MP was elected on Oct. 21.</p>

        <b>‘We followed the President’s orders’: Sondland tells impeachment inquiry Trump withheld aid to press Ukraine on probes</b>
      </p>
      <p>President Donald Trump ordered U.S. diplomats to push Ukraine to investigate his political opponents<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-we-followed-the-presidents-orders-sondland-tells-impeachment/">, a high-ranking envoy told a congressional impeachment inquiry</a>. Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said there was a “quid pro quo” to withhold nearly US$400-million in military aid and a White House invitation for Ukraine’s President to put pressure on Kyiv to launch the probes. And he said several people at the highest levels of the administration knew about the plot and, in some cases, encouraged it.</p>

        <b>Canadian doctors diagnose new vaping-related lung disease in Ontario teen: report</b>
      </p>
      <p>Canadian doctors say they have diagnosed a<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-doctors-diagnose-new-type-of-vaping-related-lung-disease-in/"> new type of severe vaping-related lung disease</a>. The Ontario case, published Thursday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, involved a previously healthy 17-year-old boy from the London, Ont., area who nearly died.</p>
      <p>Doctors are focusing on flavour ingredients in the e-cigarettes he used because his illness, called bronchiolitis obliterans, is remarkably similar to the serious, chronic lung disease experienced by some workers who were exposed to the chemical flavouring agent diacetyl in microwave popcorn factories.</p>

        <b>Prince Andrew stepping back from royal duties after much-criticized interview about relationship with Jeffrey Epstein</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a controversial interview on BBC television, the Duke of York said that he regretted his association with Mr. Epstein, who died in jail while awaiting trial on charges of sex-trafficking dozens of girls. Police are still investigating whether his former girlfriend groomed girls, and several alleged victims have come forward to urge Prince Andrew to co-operate with the probe. The Prince had hoped the interview would address allegations that he slept with a teenaged girl procured by the financier. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canadian-organizations-among-those-cutting-ties-with-prince-andrew/">Instead, the interview only raised more questions</a>. Since then, a growing number of charities and companies around the world have begun cutting ties to him.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mike Babcock, who was expected to change the fortunes of the Maple Leafs, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article-maple-leafs-fire-mike-babcock-amid-six-game-losing-streak/">was fired as head coach on Wednesday</a> with the team in the midst of a six-game losing streak. He will be replaced by Sheldon Keefe, who was in his fifth year as coach of the Toronto Marlies of the AHL. Handed the richest coaching contract in NHL history in 2015, Babcock was unable to get Toronto beyond the first round of the playoffs. The team stumbled out of the gate this season and was 9-10-4 when he was dismissed.</p>

      <p>Picking apples is a fall tradition, but what happens when you end up with 20 pounds of them? Ian Brown revived an unexpected gift of apples from an acquaintance who owned a farm. Then he had to figure out what to do with all of them. If you went apple picking with the kids, or need a recipe for apples, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/article-picking-apples-is-a-fall-tradition-but-what-happens-when-you-end-up/">you can read how he found a culinary solution here</a>. “The point is that an unexpected gift of 20 pounds of apples is still a gift. If you pass the gift along, you also pass along the sweetness of random and unexpected generosity,” said Brown.</p>

        <b>Nov. 21, 1988</b>
      </p>
      <p>Indigenous men such as Louis Riel had come before her. But when Ethel Blondin-Andrew was elected as a member of Parliament on Nov. 21, 1988, she became the first Indigenous woman to win a seat in the House of Commons. By then, it had not even been three decades since First Nations people could vote without relinquishing their treaty status. A former teacher and public servant from the Northwest Territories, Blondin-Andrew unseated Progressive Conservative MP Dave Nickerson in the expansive riding then known as Western Arctic. She served as opposition critic on Indigenous affairs and, after she was re-elected when the Liberals rose to power in 1993 under Jean Chrétien, she became the first Indigenous woman to serve in cabinet, as the secretary of state for youth and training. Her tenure as an MP was marked by several controversies, including criticism for her handling of a public-expense account, and allegations – which she denied – that she tried to dissuade the mother of an alleged sexual-assault victim from pursuing charges against Chrétien’s son (Michel Chrétien was found not guilty in that case). After five terms, Blondin-Andrew was defeated in 2006 by Dennis Bevington of the NDP. <i>— Kathryn Blaze Baum</i></p>
