      <p>Adam Shelton, the UK house and techno artist who runs One Records alongside Subb-an, traces his pivot to electro back to Freerotation festival in 2016. Alex Downey was on the decks, thumping out bombs by the likes of DMX Krew, Underground Resistance and Drexciya. Shelton, a lifelong collector of electro, was blown away. A year later, with the approval of Craig Richards, he played his first electro set at Houghton Festival, warming up for another legend of the genre, Radioactive Man. <br/><br/>Fast-forward two years and we have <i>Zero Point Access</i>, Shelton's first EP under his new alias, A-Future. "No Era," the only original cut, is an impressive debut, all amen breaks, eerie synth licks and explosive gear changes. There's a lot going on, but the noise never overwhelms. Of the two remixes, Alex Jann's electro slammer is the pick: fat, cosmic and ferocious, with wonderfully crisp drums.</p>
