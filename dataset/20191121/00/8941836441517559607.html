      <h1>Joe Biden, the punch line that keeps on giving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/cheryl-k-chumley/" target="_blank">Cheryl K. Chumley</a></address>

        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Joe Biden</a>, during the most recent Democratic debate, told an MSNBC-watching audience that men shouldn’t ever “raise a hand to a woman in anger” — except when he has to, when it’s “self-defense.” And then he went on to talk about society’s need to keep “punching,” “punching,” “punching” away at the culture of violence that’s infested our nation.</p>
      <p>And wait for it, wait for it: That wasn’t even <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a>’s worst debate-related moment.</p>
      <p>Republicans are loving this man. He’s just the laugh track that keeps on playing.</p>
      <p>“No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/11/20/democrat-debate-biden-keep-punching-domestic-violence/4256766002/">said</a>.</p>
      <p>That’s like saying men shouldn’t hit women, except in rare cases. And that’s like saying men sometimes have a right to hit women.</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>He then added: “So we have to just change the culture, period. And keep punching at it and punching it and punching at it.”</p>
      <p>There’s imagery for you.</p>
      <p>No danger of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Joe</a> being asked to serve as a spokesman for Abused Women Of America, is there?</p>
      <p>Then there was that whole stumble over how many black women actually have served in the Senate thing, when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a>, bragging about his support from blacks, said he was endorsed by the “only African American woman ever elected to the Senate” — a reference that seemed to go to Carol Moseley Braun, but that conveniently forgot the woman standing on stage, fourth from his right, Sen. Kamala Harris.</p>

        <p>Funny stuff?</p>
        <p>Forgetful stuff. Forgetful stuff that doesn’t do much to allay the concerns of those who think the guy, at 77, carrying the “Sleepy <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Joe</a>” nickname, might in fact be too old to serve.</p>
        <p>Then there was this: ‘Did I make you proud?’: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a> team blasts out post-debate fundraising plea hours before debate kicks off,” Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/20/biden-team-debate-fundraising-plea-2020-072212">wrote</a> in a headline.</p>
        <p>Too true; <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a>’s team actually sent out an email requesting feedback on his debate performance — fully six hours before the debate even began.</p>
        <p>The email, a fundraiser, no less, kicked off with this: “I’m leaving the fifth Democratic debate now. I hope I made you proud out there, and I hope I made it clear to the world why our campaign is so important.”</p>
        <p>At least with a Biden White House, America would laugh. Any <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a>, not just <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Joe</a>.</p>
        <p>When DNA just confirmed that Hunter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a> is the biological father of a child born to a woman in Arkansas in August of 2018, “Team Trump” <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1197257754404118530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197257754404118530%7Ctwgr%5E363937393b70726f64756374696f6e&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftownhall.com%2Ftipsheet%2Fbronsonstocking%2F2019%2F11%2F20%2Flol-trump-congratulates-joe-biden-after-news-that-dna-confirms-hunter-biden-fath-n2556823">sprang</a> to respond on Twitter with this: “Congratulations, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Joe Biden</a>!”</p>
        <p>You’re a grandfather.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a>’s known for his gaffes. He’s handed free passes on his blunders all the time simply because of his reputation as a gaffe master. But all jokes aside, does America really need a jokester for a president? Or worse: an incompetent.</p>
