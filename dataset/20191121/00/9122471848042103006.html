      <h1>Urban Meyer Has Telling Comment On Potential Return To Coaching</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:19:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The past few months have been quite the adjustment period for Urban Meyer, who retired from coaching after last season’s Rose Bowl. When asked about whether or not he’d potentially return to coaching, the three-time national champion did admit that he still misses it.</p>
      <p>Meyer is currently working as an analyst for FOX Sports. He’s a crucial component of their college football coverage on Saturdays.</p>
      <p>Recently, Meyer appeared on Dan Dakich and Seth Greenberg’s “Courtside” podcast.</p>
      <p>Dakich asked Meyer if he would ever get back into coaching. Even though he didn’t reject the idea of making a return to college football, he did admit that he likes having free time to enjoy other aspects of life.</p>
      <p>“The hardest part of the day is the first 30 minutes of every morning,” Meyer told Dakich and Greenberg. “It’s down to about 30 minutes now. It used to be about an hour or an hour-and-a-half where I just missed it so bad. But I’m so into this FOX college football team that I have. I’m so into other things, whether it be business opportunities or something else. I’m also into my grandchildren and wife and family. We’re traveling and doing some cool things. I played Augusta (National) two weeks ago – when could you have ever done that in the fall? So it’s a nice life out there.”</p>
      <p>Here’s the audio from his interview on the “Courtside” podcast:</p>

      <p>Meyer does sound at peace with his post-football career. That being said, there’s a strong chance he’ll be linked to a few jobs this upcoming offseason.</p>
      <p>Do you think Meyer will return to college football?</p>
