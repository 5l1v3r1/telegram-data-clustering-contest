      <p>A new surfing book features Sumner surfers from the 1940s until now.</p>
      <p>‘NZ SURF: The Collection Volume II’ by photographer, writer and surf historian Warren Hawke is a celebration of New Zealand surfing.</p>
      <p>With more than 400 photos and written content of 60,000 words, it follows up from Hawke’s highly successful volume one which was published in 2017 and has since sold out.</p>
      <p>The book is a smorgasbord of photographic and written material interwoven with surfing history, surfer profiles, environmental articles and their impact on the surfing community and a selection of surfing highlights.</p>
      <p>Ninety-year-old Tony Johnson of Redcliffs has a special place near the beginning of the coffee table style book.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson, with good friend Neil Truscott, built around 100 hollow plywood surfboards in the 1950s and early 1960s.</p>
      <p>These were manufactured under the ‘Dolphin’ label and are an integral and important part of New Zealand surfing history.</p>
      <p>Denis Quane of Moncks Spur, a pioneer builder of fibreglass surfboards from the 1960s, also has a special place.</p>
      <p>It includes an outline of his factory history in Sumner and Redcliffs through until he and his wife Chris opened their first Surf Dive’N Ski shop in the city in 1969.</p>
      <p>Denis is still shaping surfboards at 77 years old.</p>
      <p>His boards are now treasured collector’s items amongst the surfing community.</p>
      <p>Surfing at Scarborough Beach is central to the ‘Logburner Chapter,’ with photos and information about modern longboarding.</p>
      <p>Photographic and reflective essays intertwined with poetry celebrate the rich culture that the regeneration of longboard, logging and the retro style shortboard bring to wave riding.</p>
      <p>The ‘Coming Through’ chapter contains a feature for teenagers based on skills for surfing and skills for growing through the teenage years.</p>
      <p>The author has drawn upon more than 50 years of surfing experience and involvement in researching and assembling this volume.</p>
      <p>His connection includes surfing successfully at a competitive level, organisation and management of major surfing competitions and festivals and the position of chief judge at the New Zealand Surfing Championships.</p>
      <p>Over the past 40 years, Mr Hawke has been a freelance writer and photographer for surfing magazines around the world.</p>
      <p>He has also included material from other surf photographers and writers to extend the content and coverage of New Zealand surf and surfers.</p>
      <p>The design and layout of the book by graphic artist Josh O’Rouke has been a balancing act between content and space.</p>
      <p>His flair and ability has ensured the book presents itself as a volume jam-packed with surfing culture.</p>
      <p>The book is published by Auckland based beach and surf publisher Photo CPL and is available from most book shops and a number of surf shops.</p>
