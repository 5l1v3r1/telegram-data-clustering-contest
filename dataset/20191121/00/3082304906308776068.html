      <p>Anthony Joshua has vowed to “whup” Andy Ruiz Jr and says everyone should bow to his greatness after he wins their world heavyweight title rematch.</p>
      <p>Ruiz sensationally knocked Joshua out to claim his IBF, WBA and WBO titles at Madison Square Garden in June.</p>
      <p>Joshua says it will be a very different story when he steps into the ring with the Mexican in Saudi Arabia on December 7.</p>
      <p>“I’m fighting the best man in the world now,” Joshua told Sky Sports News. “I’m going to whup him, and show how great I am.</p>
      <p>“They think he’s so great, so when I beat him I want everybody to bow to my feet and tell me how great I am.”</p>

      <p>He added: “I couldn’t beat Ruiz Jr before and get the credit I deserved.</p>
      <p>“You saw me in the ring – I wasn’t fighting King Kong, was I? [I didn’t have] that mindset.</p>
      <p>“Apparently I’m fighting the quickest hands and the best fighter in the division. So once I beat him I want everybody to bow to me.”</p>
      <p>Joshua says he has learned from the experience of his first professional defeat in New York.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old stated: “My body is in pain. I know how to fight, I know how to box. That’s a good place to be in – when you don’t second-guess yourself.</p>
      <p>“You go into a boxing ring without questioning yourself. I feel like I can control myself, and I have learned. In the first fight when I put him down, maybe I should have controlled myself more.</p>
      <p>“The blessing is that, out of such adversity, such great opportunity has come to right my wrong and become a two-time heavyweight champion. To prove to the world – no, not to the world. To prove to myself that the changes I wanted to make will pay off. That’s a good place to be in.”</p>
