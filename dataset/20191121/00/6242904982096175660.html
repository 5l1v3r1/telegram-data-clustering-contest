        <b>Ghana midfielder Nasiru Mohammed has returned Levski Sofia training after recovering from a minor injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mohammed has been nursing an injury before the Bulgarian league was put on hold for the international break.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old however made a quick return to training on Wednesday ahead of their duel against Tsarskoe Selo on Sunday. </p>
      <p>Mohammed joined the capital-based outfit on a three-year deal in the summer after spending eight successful years with Swedish side Hacken BK.</p>
      <p>He has performed poorly at the club which has prompted the club’s decision to offload him in the forthcoming winter transfer window.</p>
