      <p>Bong Joon-ho’s black comedy “Parasite” swept this year’s Blue Dragon Awards, one of South Korea’s top film honors, taking home five prizes including best film on Thursday.</p>
      <p>At the ceremony held at Paradise City in Incheon, the film also clinched the awards for best director and art direction, while Cho Yeo-jeong and Lee Jung-eun won the best actress and best supporting actress prizes, respectively.</p>
      <p>It is Bong’s third best film honor at the Blue Dragon Awards, after “Host” (2006) and “Mother” (2009).</p>
      <p>“Thank you for giving this me big prize,” he said after receiving the best director award. “I will be the most creative parasite on the Korean film scene forever.”</p>
      <p>“Parasite” was the strongest candidate for multiple trophies as it already won the Palme d’Or, the highest award at the Cannes Film Festival, a first in Korean film history. It also attracted an audience of more than 10 million people in South Korea alone.</p>
      <p>The film is a family satire that depicts the entrenched social class system through the lives of two families, one rich and one poor, with Bong’s humor and suspense.</p>
      <p>Jung Woo-sung of “Innocent Witness” was named best actor, and the best supporting actor award was given to Jo Woo-jin for his role in “Default.”</p>
      <p>Park Hae-soo scored the best new actor gong for his performance in “By Quantum Physics: A Nightlife Venture,” while Kim Hye-jun was named best new actress for “Another Child.”</p>
      <p>The best rookie director award went to Lee Sang-geun of “Exit,” while “House of Hummingbird” earned best screenplay.</p>
