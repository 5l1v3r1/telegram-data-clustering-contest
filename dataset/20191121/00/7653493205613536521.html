      <p>Officeworks is coming into its Christmas campaign telling all of Australia that no one does Christmas quite like the office supply store, reinforcing their serious commitment to the festive season this year.</p>
      <p>Releasing not just one but two Christmas catalogues, Officeworks has also prepared its first-ever gift guide for the holidays, with 12 pages of quality present ideas, to be placed inside newspapers around the country on 7 December.</p>
      <p>Officeworks General Manager Marketing, Jess Richmond said the idea for the gift guide was to help customers stop making the same gift choices again and again.</p>
      <p>‘We want to put the spark back into Christmas shopping… to inspire people to consider Officeworks as a destination that really does have something for everyone on their list’.</p>
      <p>Inside the 167 stores in Australia and online, Officeworks has built a <a href="https://www.officeworks.com.au/campaigns/shop-gift-ideas#/">gifting destination</a>, to allow customers to shop the Christmas gift range based on popular brands, trending products or based on the personality of people on their Christmas list.</p>
      <p>Plus thanks to extended trading hours and Officeworks 2-hour Click &amp; Collect, grabbing your stocking stuffers and presents for under the tree this Christmas has never been easier.</p>
