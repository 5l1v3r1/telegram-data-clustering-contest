      <p><i>Sucker </i>was the first single that the Jonas Brothers shot for in six years. The reunion was much talked about when it was announced in March.  The video had featured the wives of the Jonas Brothers, Priyanka Chopra, Sophie Turner and Danielle Jonas. In the video, the pairs are seen indulging in fun and hilarious moments.  Some of the behind-the-scenes moments had also gone viral then. The Jonas Brothers would definitely hope to win the top prize, as they’ll be motivated by their victory in the MTV Video Music Awards. They were honoured with the Video of The Year and Best Pop Video awards. <i>Sucker </i>video has a whopping 232 million views on YouTube. </p>
