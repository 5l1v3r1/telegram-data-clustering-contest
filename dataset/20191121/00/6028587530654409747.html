      <p>Yesterday evening's terse, grammatically-challenged statement from HRH The Duke of York declaring his decision to withdraw from public life – more specifically, his retreat from some 200 charities and attendant royal duties – was a curiously revealing Royal Family bombshell in several ways. At a bit over a hundred words, it carried all the minor scars of great haste, a singular verb in the first sentence instead of the correct plural, a split infinitive in the second sentence, that sort of thing. And in fact, Andrew would have been acting in haste as he and what remains of his staff presumably composed it. The Queen's beleaguered third child had just been called down from Windsor to Buckingham Palace by his super-sturdy mother, who, though celebrating her 72<sup>nd</sup> wedding anniversary yesterday, took the time to tell him to pack up and get the heck out of the family office, fast. So, he did.</p>

      <p>Reportedly, the move was discussed by the Queen and her regent-in-effect, Charles, currently on royal duties in New Zealand and the Pacific, before she invited Andrew onto the carpet for the genteel, but firm, maternal edict. Although it's certain that both the Queen, Charles, and arguably Andrew would vastly prefer not to have had it happen as a tactic of crisis management, the axing of Andrew dovetails neatly with Charles' stated plans to form a 'leaner' royal firm going forward.</p>
      <p>In fact, the slow-mo Charles-ian constriction of the larger Court of St. James – thus necessarily diminishing the royal roles played by Andrew and his daughters – is the dragon that the somewhat flat-footed Andrew has spent the last few years fighting. The razor-sharp irony in the current retreat is that Andrew has now written himself out of the picture, leaving his daughters undefended from the winds of change at court. Classically, he, Andrew, was shown the mercy of being able to compose the statement himself, citing the whole-hog withdrawal as his own decision. Courtiers and Royals-beat journalists alike are under zero illusions as to whom was really making the call.</p>
      <p>Regarded through a longer lens, Andrew's position as a heavy-hitter in the Court of St. James has been weakening for years, if not decades, an inexorable process for which there are several reasons. There are now two tiers of heirs to the throne in the Charles line, William and young master George, and the grander focus of the court has shifted and will continue to shift to them and their roles. Andrew's occasional stridency when he perceives himself or his daughters to have been slighted in the pecking order has become increasingly visible – to his great detriment, since the one inviolable Windsor rule and general British specialty is that of the stiff upper lip. In the fishmonger's parlance, Andrew seems to be a bit of a whinger. Finally, but no less important: he faces a great social and professional liability, to which he is apparently blind, in his continued close relationship with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, whose excruciating history of desperate, ill-advised moves, such as attempting to sell access to Andrew in a newspaper sting for $650,000 in 2010, is legendary in Britain.</p>

      <p>It's thought that Ms. Ferguson has remained a close confidant of Andrew's, especially as the flames of the white-hot Epstein conflagration have been licking at his feet, and further, that she was instrumental in urging him to agree to do last weekend's disastrous BBC interview about his friendship with the American felon. The Queen, incidentally, was reported to have been informed last minute of that career-ending broadcast, but only as it was too late to interdict.</p>
      <p>Andrew's recently-hired communications secretary, the formidable Jason Stein, who had come to the palace after a stint working for former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd, argued strenuously against doing the interview. Stein knew the BBC journalist who was to do it. His sound advice was not taken, whereupon Mr. Stein proved a savvy enough courtier to lay down his sword and retire from his post before the interview aired. Apparently he hadn't been on duty long enough even to get paid. It would be fair to say that the Palace wishes that Mr. Stein's warnings had been heeded.</p>
      <p>Hasty as Andrew's royal missive was on the surface, and as revealing as it was of his personal, specific, and combative concerns, the urgency and force of this resignation raise more questions than the letter, such as it was, could or should answer. By contrast, Edward VIII's abdication of throne in December 1936 so that he could marry the American divorcee Wallis Simpson looks positively graceful.</p>
      <p>The business end of the Firm, as the Royal Family is familiarly called, is in patronages. The patronages can be as simple and straightforward as Harry's Sentebale charity, which benefits HIV-affected children in Lesotho and Botswana and which the prince admirably created in 2004 after a gap year in Lesotho. Or, they can be as complex and multifaceted as the business-mentoring scheme from which Andrew has just withdrawn, Pitch@Palace, several of whose big-time corporate sponsors, such as the Queen's own accountants, KPMG, were also busily jumping ship in the volcanic wake of the prince's disastrous interview. Ten global firms resigned from the initiative within 72 hours of the BBC broadcast, an attrition rate that even Buckingham Palace cannot afford.</p>
      <p>Seen this way, Andrew, beloved son, erstwhile fighter pilot and Falklands War combat veteran, had become a crippling liability for the Crown's central business, which is to use the patented thousand-year Windsor <i>glamour</i>, if you will, to attract money to causes. Andrew's years-long association with Jeffery Epstein was not simply endangering the reputation of his family, it was causing a rupture in that ever-so-delicate, tacit, patriotic "agreement" that the Windsors have with their subjects, with their corporate sponsors and with the British government. Paraphrased bluntly, if it were set down, the unwritten law of being a full-time working British royal would look something like this: <i>If you cannot dress, show up and keep it together to remain a money magnet for charity, then what's the use?</i> Andrew never had a problem dressing and showing up. It was that last requirement that snagged him.</p>
      <p>Andrew will be stripped of his Palace office and his approximately $300,000 annual salary with brio. Less clear and in some cases wholly undecided is what will happen to his causes. In cases such as that of the English National Ballet, one senses that the organizations have the brawn and the social depth of bench in other patrons, so that they can soldier on. It's the dozens of smaller causes in the 200 that deserve care and consideration now.</p>
      <p>Aptly, given the substance of the scandal, schools and children's charities who have benefited from the prince's fundraising skills are keenly motivated to remove his name. The administration of the University of Huddersfield, in Yorkshire, had been in support of his assuming the role of Chancellor, but this week, post-BBC interview, the Huddersfield student body has erupted in protest, which at this writing continues. As of today in Britain, it doesn't seem that the avalanche of momentum away from Andrew will stop anytime soon. Rather, the velocity and force of that seems only to be increasing across industries and through the great swaths of British society in which he moved.</p>
      <p>In retreat, he will continue to be harried, first, because the interview did the opposite of drawing a line under his involvement in the scandal, rather, it whetted the appetite to know more, especially across the pond, among the attorneys for Mr. Epstein's victims and any possible prosecutors with the required jurisdiction. It's not as if, now, the Duke of York could pull back to Windsor and quietly engage in a bit of rehabilitative charity to a good cause. Andrew's is the Sackler-family model of disaster – it keeps on ballooning as the universities and museums queue up to have the stonemasons sandblast the names off the grand marble lintels. Ergo, the redemptive option of charity work has dried up for Andrew – that's the smouldering wreckage of his chunk in the family business from which he's now walking. In swiftly distancing him, the Queen and his brother Charles are defending the castle from collateral damage.</p>
      <p>Put differently, if the Queen and her court at the time thought that 1992, the year that Charles and Diana's marriage woes erupted, was, in her famous Latin usage, an <i>annus horribilis</i>, a terrible year, then Prince Andrew's entanglements now surfacing for proper dissection will make 1992 seem like a cakewalk.</p>
