      <p><b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/musa-wada/"><u>Musa Wada</u></a></b> the flagbearer for the <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/pdp/"><u>Peoples Democratic Party, PDP</u></a></b>, candidate in the just concluded governorship election in Kogi State has called on the Nigerian Police to fish out killers of Acheju Abu.</p>
      <p>Recall that during a bloody clash by party supporters on Monday at Ochadamu, Ofu Local Government area of Kogi State, two people were killed.</p>
      <p>The state Police Command’s Spokesman, DSP Willam Aya, who confirmed the development on Tuesday, said that a former councillor in the local government, Mrs Salome Abu and Mr Awalu Zekeri died in the crisis.</p>
      <p>Aya explained that the crisis started following a misunderstanding between Zekeri of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Mr Goodwin Simeon, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p>
      <p>To retaliate , some angry youths in Ochadamu went to the house of Mr Simeon Abuh, who is an uncle to the suspect and set it ablaze.</p>
      <p>He said 60-year-old Mrs Salome Abuh died inside the house after she was burned to death.</p>
      <p>Wada who paid a condolence visit to the family of the deceased on Tuesday called on the Nigeria Police to investigate and arrest the killers of Abu.</p>
      <p>On his Twitter page, he wrote: “<i>Earlier today, I paid a condolence visit to the family of the Late Mrs. Acheju Abu who was burnt alive in her house in Ochadamu, of Ofu Local Government Area of Kogi state. She was a sincere servant of our party and the masses.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I call on the Nigeria Police to investigate and arrest the killers of the Late Achebu. May the good Lord comfort her family for her untimely departure.”</i>
