      <p><b>Best answer:</b> No, as of now, there are no promo codes available for Disney+. However, some great deals are going on right now that can get you discounts on a subscription.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Welcome to the kingdom: <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU81591YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.disneyplus.com%252Fsign-up&amp;token=kbiq-pPu">Disney+</a> (From $7/mo at Disney+)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Disney at a discount</h3>
      <p>With so many streaming services out there and each one having content unique to their service, it's not hard to find yourself with a few different subscriptions — and that means the dollars add up pretty quick. So finding ways to save a buck here and there is a great way to help out the budget while still getting the content you want, and Disney+ is going to have some content you will likely want.</p>
      <p>As it stands now, Disney isn't offering any promo codes. However, there are a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus-free-price">few different ways</a> to get yourself a discount on your subscription.</p>
      <h3>Can you watch me now?</h3>
      <p>If you are a Verizon customer, then you might have the best deal of all. As the exclusive wireless partner for Disney+, it's giving customers a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know">free year of Disney's new streaming service</a>. It's important to ensure you have <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-verizon-unlimited-plans-disney-plus">the right Verizon plan</a> so that your Disney+ streaming comes through without a hitch.</p>
      <h3>Getting the deals</h3>
      <p>While it may not be an outright discount, there is a bundle for $12.99 that gets you Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ together. With this package, you get to catch all your favorite Disney content from Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, NatGeo, and more as well as great shows on Hulu, and all the sports you could want from ESPN. If you were to purchase each of these services separately, you'd be paying about $18.</p>
      <p>Also, if you know that you are going to love Disney+ for at least a year, then you can pay for an annual subscription for $70 — which breaks down to $5.83 per month.</p>
      <p>Disney has a lot to offer on its new streaming service, from classics like Snow White and Mary Poppins to new favorites Toy Story and Coco. Aside from the prominent Disney shows, there is also going to be original content made only available on Disney+, including shows like the Mandalorian, Loki, Monsters at Work, Magic of the Animal Kingdom, and so much more.</p>
      <p>Best of all: signing up gets you a seven-day free trial so you can test the service before committing to a payment plan.</p>

      <p>Disney+ is a great deal on its own, but when you compare it to other streaming services and what Disney has to offer, it's a great deal in general.</p>
