      <p>The new Red Dead Redemption 2 update on PC weighs in at just under 3GB and fixes that annoying “Red Dead Redemption 2 exited unexpectedly” error amongst numerous others. Before we get to the update notes, NVIDIA has also released new GeForce drivers with a hotfix (version 441.34) for the Game Ready drivers released earlier, so if you haven’t updated yet, you can <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4930">grab the GeForce drivers hotfix here</a> that address the issue of the game stalling on some systems with 4-core and 6-core CPU.</p>
