      <p>Late Tuesday night, <a href="http://nixle.us/BFLCF?fbclid=IwAR2ghkZplUN5cOmz1n-oqIEMe8_FRheodO2SQoysSauFuwQC929aJ_AdXKA">police said</a> they responded to the scene to find 23-year-old Amna Ahmed’s car stuck on the train tracks.</p>
      <p>Dashcam video shows an Amtrak train barreling into the car at full speed. The impact sends the car spinning away into a responding officer’s vehicle.</p>
      <p>Authorities said debris pelted another police vehicle and a car belonging to Ahmed’s father, who’d arrived with Ahmed’s sister before police to help get Ahmed’s car off the tracks.</p>
      <p>The officer in the impacted cruiser had gotten out before Ahmed’s car hit it. Police said no one was injured in the incident. Ahmed’s car, however, was destroyed.</p>
      <p>Police said it appears Ahmed had gotten her car stuck after wrongfully turning onto an Amtrak service road. She was charged with DWI and reckless driving.</p>
