      <p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Virginia’s governor is urging the Trump administration to stop a company that makes fish-oil supplements from fishing in the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
      <p>Gov. Ralph Northam has asked U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to place a moratorium on the catching of menhaden in the bay.</p>
      <p>Northam’s letter, dated Wednesday, says the moratorium will protect a fish that’s vital to the bay’s food chain and serves as food for striped bass, dolphins and birds.</p>
      <p>The firm, Omega Protein, harvests menhaden to make fish-oil supplements and other products. The firm defied catch limits in the bay set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The commission is also asking Ross to intervene.</p>

        <p>Omega Protein has said that menhaden aren’t being overfished and that the commission’s harvest cap lacks scientific justification.</p>
