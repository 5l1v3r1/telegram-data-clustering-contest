      <p>There are now 9 confirmed cases of measles from the Serua/Namosi subdivision as two news cases have been confirmed from the subdivision.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services says, the 2 new cases are of a 15-year-old from Wainadoi and a 2-year-old who had been staying in Waibogi, Serua.</p>
      <p>The Ministry says the 2-year-old had returned home to Koronivia on the 18th of November and is currently admitted under isolation at the CWM Hospital in Suva after returning from the Nakasi Health Centre on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They are urging employers to provide their support to the control of this outbreak by not penalizing employees that are placed under quarantine and subsequently are unable to work.</p>
      <p>They say quarantine is needed to protect others from getting the disease, and employees must be allowed to comply with quarantine without fear for loss of income or employment.</p>
      <p>Those under quarantine will be provided with the appropriate medical certification for the quarantine period.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Health is urging people to get vaccinated at any Health Centres and Hospitals around the country.</p>
      <p>The symptoms of measles are fever and a rash with a runny nose, sneezing, cough, red and watery eyes and white spots inside the mouth.</p>
      <p>The rash starts after the other symptoms and spreads all over the body.</p>
      <p>Measles is a highly infectious airborne viral disease that spreads easily through the air through breathing, coughing, and sneezing.</p>
      <p>You are at risk of getting measles if you breathe the same air as someone with the disease and you are not immune if you have not been vaccinated, or you have never had the disease.</p>
      <p>There is no specific treatment for measles, as it is the bodyâ€™s immune system that fights off the disease.</p>
      <p>Most people recover from measles infection in 8-10 days with rest and ensuring that they are eating and drinking to avoid dehydration.</p>
      <p>Some people infected with measles develop severe complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis (brain swelling).</p>
      <p>The last measles outbreak in Fiji was in 2006 and the last cases of measles were reported in 2016 which was brought in by people from other countries.</p>
