      <h1>Bullish on Bank Nifty: Gautam Shah, Goldilocks Premium Research</h1>
      <h2>Speaking about the telecom space, he said: "Telecom has not worked for many years and I wouldn't want to commit too much into telecom stocks."</h2>

      <p>Gautam Shah, founder and chief strategist at Goldilocks Premium Research, on November 21, said that there is a possibility of the Nifty hitting 13,000 in a few weeks as the market is headed higher and it is only going to get better.</p>
      <p>He said that not only the Nifty but broader markets are also likely to get stronger.</p>
      <p>"I think the run has just started. One should not look at it from a short-term perspective because there are much greater games to pay for and in the oil and gas space the charts are really nice. So a 10-12 percent upside over the next 4-6 weeks on the entire oil and gas index looks likely," said Shah in an interview with <i>CNBC-TV18</i>.</p>
      <p>About Nifty Bank, Shah said: "With the price performance in the last couple of months, one would notice that Nifty Bank took a little bit of a time to get past the post-tax announcement high and that happened in the last one-one-and-a-half week and after having done that the Nifty Bank has greater momentum than the Nifty."</p>
      <p>Speaking about the telecom space, he said: "Telecom has not worked for many years and I wouldn't want to commit too much into telecom stocks. The medium-term charts are still very weak and I don’t think this is a good time to be lapping them up. There are much better bets in the market and there is one underperforming space which is going to make a big comeback — pharma. It was in a three-year bear market, I think that bear market got completed 2 months back and if this pharma recovery is for real, which I think is the case, this entire pack can give 20 percent move over the next 2-3 months."</p>
