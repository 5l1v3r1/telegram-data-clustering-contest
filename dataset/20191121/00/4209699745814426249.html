      <p>Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has rejected the ruling of a Kano High Court, which sacked four emirs he recently appointed.</p>
      <p>Justice Usman Na’Abba had in a ruling on Thursday dissolved the four new first-class emirates, stating that the law creating them did not follow due process.</p>
      <p>SaharaReporters had exclusively reported how Ganduje planned and executed a three-step plan to oust Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, and disintegrate the Kano emirate, which had been around for centuries over a personal feud.</p>
      <p>Ganduje in a statement by the Commissioner for Information in the state, Mallam Muhammad Garba, said the state was studying the ruling of the court on the creation of four new emirates with a view to taking immediate appropriate action.</p>
      <p>He posited that the government will not fold its arms and concede such constitutional power in the interest of the well-being of the people and general development of the state.</p>
      <p>The statement said, “Despite the ruling, the government still recognises them as first class emirs and will continue dealing with them as such.</p>
      <p>“The state government therefore advises people to be calm, law-abiding and await further action.” </p>
