      <p>The Brooklyn Nets are currently trying to solve a math problem. After signing Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Caris LeVert to $357 million worth in contracts during the offseason, Brooklyn is struggling to add up enough scoring and defense to multiply its win total.</p>
      <p>After a 2-3 Western road trip and an embarrassing home loss to Indiana, the Nets finally got enough defensive stops and knocked off the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday 101-91 to improve to a middling 6-8. Was it pretty? Hardly, but Brooklyn will take any win it can get as Irving recovers from a shoulder injury that could keep him out of the lineup for his long-awaited return to Boston next week.</p>
      <p>“We’re still trying to build that consistency and be more consistent over long periods,” Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson said before Wednesday’s game.</p>
      <p>Spencer Dinwiddie’s been the main supplier of that offensive consistency, and posted 20 points and eight assists against Charlotte. But it was Taurean Prince’s 20 and eight rebounds and Jarrett Allen’s 22 with 17 boards (both season highs) that provided the offense Brooklyn desperately needed.</p>
      <p>“I definitely have to be more consistent,” said Prince, who’s shooting 39.4% from three but a lackluster 42.2% on twos. “I’ve been up and down, and that’s just not myself.”</p>

      <p>A main theme of the Nets’ season thus far has been allowing big scoring nights to opposing centers like Minnesota’s Karl-Anthony Towns, Indiana’s Domantas Sabonis and Detroit’s Andre Drummond. With Cody Zeller in foul trouble and Bismack Biyombo a non-factor, Allen and DeAndre Jordan took advantage and were the biggest factors in the game.</p>
      <p>That duo helped Brooklyn hold Charlotte to 37% shooting and forced 16 turnovers, much better than its season averages. Before the game, the Nets ranked 29th in the NBA in total turnovers forced and dead last in turnover percentage at 10.8%.</p>
      <p>“Honestly we do play a conservative scheme, but we need to generate more,” Atkinson said. “I think we put in some things that encourage that. It hasn’t turned yet, but we’re aware of it. We’re pushing for more activity.”</p>
      <p>Allen said that activity means being more energized out there, showing your hands on defense and getting those hands into passing lanes. One downside to that, he said, is that sometimes going into passing lanes opens up layups for their opponents. That’s manifested itself in allowing the most points to pick-and-roll ball-handlers.</p>
      <p>“It’s kinda tough because when you’re in the passing lane, you’re gonna give up a layup,” Allen said. “So we need to just keep having our hands active.”</p>
      <p>Brooklyn came into Wednesday’s game ranked 20th in both offensive and defensive efficiency. So Atkinson knows he has to find the right rotations and lineup combinations to get these Nets going on both ends.</p>
      <p>Joe Harris gave Brooklyn solid minutes despite an uncharacteristically bad shooting night— Atkinson wants him shooting way more, even if the shots are contested— and the team got solid minutes from Jordan, Garrett Temple and Dzanan Musa. But the Nets still shot a woeful 39.6% from the field and 10-for-39 from three, which is just not going to get it done on most nights.</p>
      <p>“We’re struggling to score the ball,” Atkinson said. “We’re gonna have to go to the drawing board and find some solutions there. It’s tough to defend when you’re not putting it in the hole.”</p>

      <p>Charlotte’s bench outscored Brooklyn’s 34-27, with Musa, Theo Pinson and newcomer Iman Shumpert playing significant minutes with Dinwiddie and Temple elevated to the starting lineup.</p>
      <p>“We need it. There’s no doubt about it,” Atkinson said regarding scoring from the second unit. “We’ve gotta find a way to generate offense.”</p>
      <p>Jordan, who scored 14 points and had corralled seven rebounds, had a much more optimistic outlook when asked about the team’s offensive woes.</p>
      <p> “I don’t think it’s gonna be a struggle for us to score, we’re just gonna have to score in different ways until we get those guys back,” Jordan said. “This time right now is good for us because we need to get better. And whenever we get those guys back, we’ll be a better team.” </p>

      <p>With Durant out for the season and LeVert still at least a few weeks away with an injured thumb, the Nets are trying to be patient while Irving is on the mend.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he could play through it right now, quite honestly,” Atkinson said. “The shoulder’s sensitive, especially for a point guard. It’s like a quarterback. The way he shoots it, passing, the whole thing.”</p>
      <p>Despite a slow and disappointing start, the opportunity is there for Brooklyn to quickly turn this around. After a home game Friday night against struggling Sacramento, the Nets have road games against New York and Cleveland before a home-and-home against Boston.</p>
      <p>If Brooklyn can find the right rotations, keep its defensive intensity and activity and add up enough points to benefit from a soft schedule, the Nets may be able to actually solve this difficult early season equation after all.</p>
