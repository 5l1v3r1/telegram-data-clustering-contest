      <h1>‘Fun as Hell’: Kawhi Leonard and Paul George Share Court for the First Time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p>The LA Clippers’ stunning offseason haul materialized in full for the first time Wednesday night, with <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/paul-george">Paul George</a> joining new teammate <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> on the court.</p>
      <p>It was “fun as hell” for Clipper Nation as the superstar duo helped engineer a thrilling 107-104 win against the visiting Boston Celtics.</p>

      <p>PG admits, however, that the team is still going through some “growing pains.”</p>

      <p>Per <i><a href="https://apnews.com/f33529e4de614953812d047333e92386">The AP</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“It’s still tough,” said Leonard, who missed the previous three games with a sore knee. “We’re both on kind of minute restrictions so it’s hard to get a flow.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>George said he and Leonard are trying to get in sync with their other teammates.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“We’re going to have growing pains,” he said. “The great thing about myself and Kawhi is it doesn’t matter, we’re going to play basketball. Try to make the right plays and play off each other and just keep the game flowing. I thought in that aspect we were good.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>It was a wild and sloppy game for both teams. The Clippers committed 23 turnovers (Williams had seven while Leonard and George had five each) to 17 for the Celtics.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“That was an ugly win, but it was beautiful,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers said.</i>
