      <h1>Foxtel Brings ABC iview App To iQ3 &amp; iQ4</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/jan-arreza/" target="_blank">Jan Arreza</a></address>
      <p>Foxtel has announced the arrival of the ABC iview app on iQ3 and iQ4 set top boxes, as part of its continuing drive to bring customers the best of TV and on-demand, all in one place.</p>
      <p>ABC iview’s arrival positions Foxtel as Australia’s largest source of streaming content with ABC programming now sitting alongside Netflix and Foxtel content and available to stream on the iQ3 and iQ4 at the touch of a button.</p>
      <p>The addition of ABC iview follows Foxtel’s recent expansion of its long-standing relationship with the ABC, as well as the completion of its roll-out of the New Foxtel Experience across more than 1.1 million iQ3 and iQ4 set top boxes.</p>
      <p>With ABC iview now part of the New Foxtel Experience, customers can stream ABC content directly from the iQ3 and iQ4 boxes, bringing viewers a host of ABC-produced drama, entertainment and documentaries, as well as its highly acclaimed kids programming.</p>
      <p>Popular shows like <i>Total Control, Frayed, Killing Eve, Mystery Road, The Cry, Bluey</i>, and more are now available to stream on Foxtel.</p>

      <p>ABC content can be discovered and watched directly from the ‘Home’ menu, or the dedicated genres section on the set top box user interface, like TV Shows and Kids. Customers can also launch the ABC iview and ABC iview Kids apps directly.</p>
      <p>“We’re pleased to have completed the New Foxtel Experience roll-out across more than 1.1 million iQ3 and iQ4 set top boxes and the feedback from customers has been incredibly positive,” said Alice Mascia, Foxtel’s chief product and strategy officer.</p>
      <p>“Today’s addition of ABC iview to our iQ3s and iQ4s is the next step in our roadmap to bring customers the world’s best and favourite Australian entertainment all-in-one place, at the best value.”</p>
      <p>“The move greatly expands the reach of the ABC’s streaming content to more Australian homes than ever before and adds to Foxtel’s own original content.”</p>
      <p>“Our massive library of shows from the world’s leading studios and integration with Netflix, all available to stream, on-demand, from Foxtel at the touch of the ‘Home’ button of their remote control. It has never been easier to stream all your favourite content on TV.”</p>

      <p>ABC iview will begin arriving for iQ3 and iQ4 customers starting from today and will download automatically to all set top boxes progressively over the next few weeks as part of the New Foxtel Experience, which can be accessed anytime via the ‘Home’ button of the remote control.</p>
      <p>Following the integration of ABC iview on the iQ3 and iQ4 set top boxes, Foxtel is planning to add SBS On Demand on the iQ3 and iQ4 soon after.</p>
