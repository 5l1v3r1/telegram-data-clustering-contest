      <p><i>City physicians say 10 per cent of the cases they attend to are waterborne diseases</i> <br/><br/>Bengaluru’s doctors have a shocking revelation. Nearly 10 per cent of the cases that they attend to everyday are due to unsafe drinking water. A recent study by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) revealed that tap water in Bengaluru was below par. The report revealed that the tested water samples failed on the factors of total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, total hardness, total alkalinity, minerals and metals. It also confirmed the presence of coliform and E Coli bacteria, which can cause severe illnesses. <br/><br/>City doctors say tap water in the city was never safe for consumption and about 10 per cent of the cases they see include gastroenteritis, typhoid and Hepatitis A. <br/><br/>Unsafe water and its effectsDr. Manohar KN, consultant internal medicines, Manipal Hospitals says, “There is no such thing as pure water. The study by BIS shows the presence of organisms like E. coli which is a big concern. <br/><br/>The bacteria can cause UTI (Urinary Tract Infection), Gastrointestinal (GIT) infections and anaerobic sepsis. The ideal pH level of water should be between 7.2 to 7.6. The study does not reveal the mineral and metal content that was found in the tested water sample yet.” <br/><br/>Doctors say it’s not just the source of water that is contaminated but the water can get contaminated even while distribution too. “The water can get contaminated due to naturally occurring chemicals and minerals such as arsenic, radon, uranium; use of fertilizers and pesticides; effluents from industries and overflow of sewage into the water,” says Dr Brunda M S, Consultant - Internal Medicine, Aster CMI Hospital. She adds that tap water is chlorinated. “The filters and RO purifiers do not purify water completely but the water quality is better than the unfiltered tap water. Also when people consume food at restaurants, they cannot be sure of the source of water. <br/><br/>So they must be careful,” she says. <br/><br/>Due to ground water contamination, water becomes unpotable (unsafe for drinking), says Dr Sudha Menon, Director, Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital. She adds, “With the industrial effluents being let into the lake, the water gets contaminated with chemicals leading to water borne diseases such as gastroenteritis, typhoid and Hepatitis A. Also, many do not realise the source of water. Even in bottled water, we cannot be sure if it’s just refilled and resealed.” Dr Srividhya, Consultant Internal Medicine, Columbia Asia Referral Hospital Yeshwantpur says, “To prevent waterborne infection, drinking water should be always boiled and consumed.” <br/><br/><b>Clean Solution</b> <br/><br/>Doctors suggest that the good old method of boiling water before consuming it is the best, especially if you’re unsure of its source. RO Purifiers and other filters, they say, do help to a certain extent but do not purify the water completely, says doctors. Dr Subrata Das, Senior Consultant - Internal Medicine &amp; Diabetology, Sakra World Hospital, adds, “RO purifiers reduce the hardness of water but do not kill the microbes in it.” Dr. Ravikeerthy M, Senior Consultant, General Medicine, BR Life SSNMC Hospital, says, “Even though the companies claim that their water purifiers can trap the bacteria and microbial cysts, these elements still remain in the water. RO Purifiers clean the water to a large extent but it is important to change the candles and filters regularly. If left unchecked for a long time, you may not be consuming safe water.” Doctors say boiling the water, using filters and RO purifiers are the only ways to make water safer for consumption until the sources of water are rid of any pollution or contamination. <br/><br/>One of the most affected groups is young working adults as they tend to consume water at eateries and hotels without realising the source of water, say doctors. <br/><br/><br/><u><b>Most common outbreaks because of contaminations<br/></b></u><br/><i>* Giardia nLegionella * Norovirus * Shigella * Campylobacter * Copper * Salmonella * Hepatitis A * Cryptosporidium * E. coli, excess fluoride <br/>* Skin related disease like eczema, hair fall, dandruff<br/></i><br/><b><u>Testing of drinking water samples<br/></u></b><br/><i>The BIA study was conducted as per the directions of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs Food &amp; Public Distribution to check the quality of piped drinking water being supplied in the country in keeping with the objectives of the Jal Jeevan Mission. In the first phase, samples of drinking water were drawn from various locations across Delhi and in the second phase samples were drawn from 20 other state capitals, and sent for testing as per Indian Standards. None of the samples drawn from Bengaluru complied with the requirements.<br/></i><br/><br/><b><i>Source: Dr. Brunda M S, Consultant - Internal Medicine, Aster CMI Hospital</i></b></p>
