      <p>A Kano State High Court has sacked four emirs appointed by governor of the state, Abdullahi Ganduje.</p>
      <p>SaharaReporters had exclusively reported how Ganduje planned and executed a three step plan to oust Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, and disintegrate the Kano emirate, which had been around for centuries over a personal feud.</p>
      <p>Usman Na’Abba, the presiding judge, gave the order on Thursday, TheCable reports.</p>
      <p>The governor created four additional emirates in Kano in a bid to whittle down the influence of Sanusi, who challenged the action in court.</p>
