      <h1>This Spa Combines Female Empowerment, With Wedding Beauty and Travel Prep</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">J.Q. Louise</a></address>
      <p>The beauty industry has seen lots of changes and growth over the past decade. Millennial women are now more often concerned with wellness and ‘self-care’ and how they affect beauty, rather than simply beauty as a standalone concept. I spoke with Ashley Hilmes the founder of <a href="https://vegavitality.com/">Vega Vitality</a>, a medi-spa in Boston about female empowerment, wedding beauty and travel prep.</p>

      <p>“After ten years working in the cardiac ICU, I felt it was time to live out my dream of creating a health and wellness practice. I wanted to create a place where people could come and focus on their inner beauty and health as much as their outer beauty and that’s how Vega was born.” Says Ashley regarding why she started her business. “We go beyond the surface and offer our clients an all-encompassing approach to their beauty routine with cutting edge medi-spa treatments, acupuncture and nutritional consultations.” Vega Vitality is not your normal day spa. Each practitioner remains their own boss, they lease space from Vega, but customers are able to book multiple treatments through one umbrella and one website.</p>

      <p>When I asked Ashley if female business empowerment was always a goal when she started the business, she answered, “I’ve always felt it was important to support other women in business. I love knowing that within the Vega walls that I’ve built I am helping other woman owned businesses grow and flourish as much as my own. Best of all, I’m able to offer clients a set of services unlike any other. Vega is truly a ‘one stop shop’ for all our clients’ beauty and wellness needs.” Some of the unique services offered at Vega Vitality are: dermaplaning, hydra facials, broadband laser, and IV nutritional therapy. In a city like Boston, these advanced medi-spa treatments are rare to find in a single location.</p>

      <p>Since Vega Vitality has so many powerful facial treatments, they get a lot of brides-to-be coming in for bridal beauty prep. Unlike other spas, the Vega team really goes below the surface. They offer complimentary “bridal beauty consultations” to figure out a client’s goals and a route to get there. They recommend that clients come in at least six months prior to their wedding date for the consultation so they have plenty of time for a long-term solution. And right before the wedding, their in-house lash specialist, “Lashes by Allie” is recommended to give brides the final touch to top off their look, with a fresh set of lash extensions. These extensions could range from a little natural enhancement to a full set of false beauties.</p>

      <p>Vega Vitality is also the place to visit if you are prepping for a big trip as the founder Ashley is no stranger to traveling. She has been volunteering as a nurse for over ten years on trips to Africa, Asia and Central America. “Most recently, I’ve worked with Medical Missions for Children with a team that fixes cleft lips and palates.” Ashley mentioned. And not only does she support international charities, she has made it part of the company culture as well. “We also recently hosted our first annual charity day where 100 percent of proceeds went to charities chosen by the Vega team. It was a great event and I’m looking forward to doing it again next year!”</p>
