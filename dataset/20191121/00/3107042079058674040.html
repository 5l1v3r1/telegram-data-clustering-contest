      <p>The Star has seen a big jump in readership - the biggest percentage increase of any metropolitan newspaper in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The latest Nielsen readership survey shows The Star’s readership has increased by 17 per cent on last year.</p>
      <p>The city’s paid daily newspaper The Press has seen a 24 per cent drop in readership during the same survey period.</p>
      <p>The Star has now overtaken The Press as the most read newspaper in Christchurch for average issue readership.</p>
      <p>The Star editor in chief Barry Clarke said: “The readership growth reflects the great work by our dedicated team of journalists, and our focus on local news and issues which matter to the people of Christchurch.”</p>
      <p>The Star’s regional manager Steve McCaughan said the readership result was great news for advertisers.</p>
      <p>“The Star now has the highest readership of any publication within the Christchurch metropolitan area.</p>
      <p>“Advertisers can be reassured The Star is the most read publication in Christchurch,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The other great news, is Starmax had an increase in readership, with just one advert placement reaching 158,000 readers.</p>
      <p>One ad placement in Starmax now reaches more prospective customers than any other media option available.</p>
      <p>“As advertisers require more effective advertising options in a competitive market, I’m certainly pleased that we can provide the best value, reach and results!”</p>
