      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/general-electric/"><b><u>General Electric</u></b></a><b> (NYSE: GE)</b> reported a substantial loss of $9.3 billion in Q3 2019, which compares with a net profit figure of $104 million in Q2 2019. The primary reason for such a drastic fall in profits was a pre-tax charge of $8.7 billion related to the deconsolidation of its Oil &amp; Gas segment (Baker Hughes). GE sold a total of 144.1 million shares in Baker Hughes for $3.0 billion in cash (net of expenses). This reduced the congolmerate’s ownership interest in Baker Hughes from 50.2% to 36.8% and triggered an after-tax loss of $8.1 billion as a result of the deconsolidation.Trefis analyzes the impact of the Oil &amp; Gas segment deconsolidation on General Electric’s revenue and expenses during the quarter in detail as a part of the interactive dashboard – <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/zCSy2iml/Why-General-Electric-Made-Substantial-Losses-In-Q3-2019-Versus-A-Profit-In-Q2-2019-?fromforbesandarticle=ge191121"><b>Why General Electric Reported A Substantial Loss In Q3 2019 Versus A Profit In Q2 2019?</b></a><b>, </b>parts of which are highlighted below</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>What Were The Major Impacts Of Deconsolidation?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>#1 Net Income Took A Hit Of More Than $9 Billion</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>General Electric’s net income dropped from $104 million in Q2 2019 to a net loss of $9.4 billion in Q3 2019, marking a decline of $9.5 billion during the quarter.</li>
        <li>This decrease in profitability can be attributed to a $4 billion increase in total expenses as well as a $5.5 billion decrease in total revenues.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>#2 <u>General Electric’s Top Line Shrunk Due To The Removal Of A Major Revenue Stream</u></b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>General Electric’s revenue declined by nearly $5.5 billion during the quarter primarily as a result of the absence of the Oil &amp; Gas segment which had revenues of almost $6 billion in Q2 2019. This impact was further exacerbated by a $0.8 billion decline in power segment revenues.</li>
        <li>However, the decline in revenues was partially offset by a $0.8 billion and $0.2 billion increase in Renewable and Aviation segment revenues respectively.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>#3 Total Expenses Swelled 15% Due To One-Time Charges Related To The Deconsolidation</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total expenses increased by $4 billion for Q3 primarily as a result of an $8.7 billion (pre-tax) charge related to the deconsolidation of the Oil &amp; Gas segment, partially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in cost of revenues.</li>
        <li>The primary reason for this surge was an increase in Earnings from Discontinued Operations (net of taxes) from $231 million in Q2 2019 to (-$8.1) billion in Q3 2019.</li>
        <li>Moreover, the company also revalued its remaining investment in Baker Hughes, which resulted in an unrealized loss of $86 million.</li>
        <li>However, the company’s cost of sales shrank nearly 20% sequentially thanks to the deconsolidation – falling from $21.8 billion in Q2 2019 to around $17.3 billion in Q3 2019.</li>
        <li>Additional details regarding <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/zCSy2iml/Why-General-Electric-Made-Substantial-Losses-In-Q3-2019-Versus-A-Profit-In-Q2-2019-?fromforbesandarticle=ge191121"><b>other major expense items that moved during the quarter</b></a><b> </b>are available in our interactive dashboard.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Per Trefis estimates, GE’s adjusted EPS for 2019 is likely to be $0.46. Taken together with a P/E multiple of 25x, this works to a fair value of $12 for <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/hKSXd7HI/General-Electric-Stock-(NYSE%3A-GE)?fromforbesandarticle=ge191121">GE’s stock</a> which is around the current market price.</p>
