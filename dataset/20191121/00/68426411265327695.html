      <p>Following a wave of murders, LGBT+ rights activists in El Salvador on Thursday backed a United Nations appeal for authorities to step up action to protect gay and trans people.</p>
      <p>At least four LGBT+ people have been killed in the impoverished and violence-plagued Central American country in the last month, gay and trans rights groups said, with the latest victim, Oscar Canenguez, a gay man, found dead on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the U.N. called on Salvadorean authorities “to investigate these crimes so that they might punish the perpetrators … and take urgent measures to prevent further acts of violence … against the LGBTI community.”</p>
      <p>The Salvadorean prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After the murder of a trans woman in October, President Nayib Bukele said that authorities were working to end anti-LGBT+ stigma.</p>
      <p>LGBT+ people face persistent discrimination and abuse in El Salvador, where local gang violence and entrenched social prejudices can be a deadly mix. Gay marriage is illegal and trans people cannot change their gender on official documents.</p>
      <p>The country’s influential Catholic Church and most evangelical groups publicly condemn gay marriage and sex.</p>
      <p>According to COMCAVIS Trans, a local advocacy group, some 600 LGBT+ people have been murdered in El Salvador since 1993.</p>
      <p>Campaigners said inaction on LGBT+ rights by the government of Bukele, who took office in June, was partly to blame for the rising violence.</p>
      <p>“The new authorities don’t have justice (or) the prosecution of these cases as a priority,” said Roberto Zapata, secretary general of local advocacy group AMATE El Salvador.</p>
      <p>“This new government is completely silent,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
      <p>Zapata noted with concern that the directorate of sexual diversity, which dealt with LGBT+ discrimination, had been absorbed into the ministry of culture in June.</p>
      <p>The government had yet to convene a roundtable between the justice ministry and local LGBT+ groups, Zapata said – a key forum during the previous administration for discussing issues like the violence facing the community. “There has been a change, but unfortunately it’s been for the worse,” Zapata said.</p>
      <p>Only 12 out of 109 LGBT+ murders recorded between December 2014 and March 2017 went to trial, government data shows, and there has never been as successful conviction, according to Human Rights Watch.</p>
      <p>Three out of four of the latest murders were of trans women, with one victim found in a river and another discovered naked and buried in debris.</p>
