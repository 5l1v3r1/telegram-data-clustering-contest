      <p>Charles Schwab Corp, the largest U.S. discount brokerage, is in talks to buy smaller rival TD Ameritrade and a deal could be announced as early as Thursday, CNBC reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>Shares of TD Ameritrade, which has a market capitalization of $22.41 billion, rose more than 20% to $50.01 in trading before the bell. Charles Schwab dipped 3% to $43.40.</p>
      <p>Both companies did not immediately respond to Reutersâ€™ requests for comment.</p>
      <p>A deal between Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade could be seen as a strategic response to recent disruption in the industry.</p>
      <p>Last month, Charles Schwab said it was eliminating commissions for online trading of stocks, ETFs and options listed on U.S. or Canadian exchanges, a move that was quickly followed by other players, including Fidelity Investments, E*Trade Financial and TD Ameritrade.</p>
      <p>Nimbler rivals such as Menlo Park, California-based startup brokerage Robinhood have been capturing market share in recent years by offering commission-free stock trades.</p>
      <p>If the deal goes through, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade would have combined assets of $5 trillion.</p>
