        <b>The Portrait Salon Awards 2019 celebrate images submitted to, and rejected by, the National Portrait Gallery's Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The awards were founded by Carole Evans and James O Jenkins in 2011. Photographer Peter Dench selected this year's winners.</p>
      <p>"I lived with the portraits for a week and looked at them every day. It was a short, intense and rewarding relationship," Dench said.</p>
      <p>"From the bedroom to the kitchen, the mountains to the sea, the park to posh public school.</p>
      <p>"The selection, I hope, will move you and motivate, inform, encourage and engage. It's what a portrait should do and in my opinion, these succeed."</p>

Florence Nyiramahirwe, 19, is in a relaxed mood as she recollects how she was despondent when she became pregnant at the age of 15.

        <figcaption>"The shoot took its inspiration from portraits of [artists] Gilbert and George. I started off well but inevitably ended up confusing which one was Ant and which one was Dec, constantly calling them by the wrong name. I guess they're used to it." - David Vintiner<cite>David Vintiner</cite></figcaption>
