      <p>It’s been a hot, wild and windy Thursday in Victoria, with temperatures soaring to 40.9 degrees in Melbourne just before 2pm, the equal hottest November day on record.</p>
      <p>The cool change hit the CBD shortly before 3pm and temperatures dipped 10 degrees in 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Wild winds are also lashing the state, causing significant damage.</p>
      <p>Peak gusts of up to 130 km/h have been recorded in the Grampians.</p>
      <p>Some parts of Melbourne have been hit by 80km/h winds.</p>
      <p>The SES has received hundreds of calls for assistance, and more than 70,000 Victorian homes are without power.</p>
      <p>A pedestrian was taken to Box Hill Hospital after they were struck by a falling fence this morning.</p>
      <p>They’re in a stable condition.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a glass panel has fallen some 20 storeys before shattering on Flinders Lane.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, nobody was injured.</p>
