      <p>MP for Ketu South Constituency, Fifi Kwetey has said the New Patriot Party (NPP) is ‘building the country on a platform of deception and untrustworthiness’.</p>
      <p>According to him, the assertion the Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta made during the presentation of the 2020 Budget and Economic Policy that the Akufo-Addo led administration had inherited an economy of mess was nothing but a ‘fallacy’.</p>
      <p>“There’s no government in the 4th republic that has inherited such a solid economy like the Nana Akufo-Addo led government. We the [NDC] handed to them two massive oil fields that produces some 200,000 barrels a day today, yet they claim they have inherited an economic mess”</p>
      <p>“Maybe their own Gross Domestic Product (GDP) today is on the bases of two oil fields that have been handed over to the NPP,” he added.</p>
      <p>Fifi Kwetey made this known on Tuesday, November 20 when the NDC held a public forum in response to the Finance Minister’s 2020 budget statement presentation.</p>
      <p>He added that for the first time in our history, the Mahama led administration handed over to the Akufo-Addo administration, a nation that has resolved the energy crisis.</p>
      <p>“For the first time in our lifetime, we actually had enough power to be able to give electricity to industry and individuals yet our friends [NPP] call this great legacy an economic mess,” he concluded.</p>
