      <p><b><i>Increased drought, flooding and crop failures hamper growth and threaten infrastructure, says study; Angola most at-risk<br/></i></b><br/>Climate change could directly cost the world economy $7.9 trillion by mid-century as increased drought, flooding and crop failures hamper growth and threaten infrastructure, new analysis showed Wednesday. <br/><br/>The Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) Climate Change Resilience Index measured the preparedness of the world's 82 largest economies and found that based on current trends the fallout of warming temperatures would shave off three per cent of global GDP by 2050. <br/><br/>Its analysis, which assesses each country's direct exposure to loss as climate change brings more frequent extreme weather events, found Africa was most at-risk, with 4.7 per cent of its GDP in the balance. In general, developing nations faired poorer in terms of resiliency than richer ones. <br/><br/>"Being rich matters," John Ferguson, EIU country analysis director, said. "Richer nations are really able to be more resilient towards the impacts of climate change, so this really threatens growth trajectories of the developing world as they try to catch up with the developed world." <br/><br/>"When we are already dealing with global inequality, for the impacts of climate change the developing world's challenges are much greater," he added. Of the countries evaluated, Angola stood to lose the most - as much as 6.1 per cent of gross domestic product. <br/><br/><br/>Land degradation in Angola would prove a "significant" economic hindrance, the report said, given that agriculture is its largest employer. <br/><br/>Nigeria (5.9 per cent negative GDP), Egypt (5.5 per cent), Bangladesh (5.4 per cent) and Venezuela (5.1 per cent) were the next most climate vulnerable nations identified in the analysis. The analysis said rising temperatures meant the global economy was projected to hit $250 trillion by 2050, as opposed to $258 trillion with no climate impact. <br/><br/><br/>While the US - still the world's largest economy at market rates - is forecast to be one of the least impacted, the EIU noted that President Donald Trump's policies represented a "temporary setback" in the climate fight. Russia was predicted to lose five per cent of GDP by 2050 and will "suffer more than most other countries in the world from the negative effects of climate change", it said.</p>
