      <p>South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Co. said Thursday it has unveiled its Vision T SUV concept at the Los Angeles Auto Show.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of the SUV concept is in line with Hyundai Motor’s stepped-up efforts to strengthen its SUV lineup amid rising demand for recreational vehicles.</p>
      <p>Hyundai applied its “Sensuous Sportiness” design to the plug-in hybrid SUV concept. Sensuous Sportiness is defined by the harmony between four fundamental elements in vehicle design — proportion, architecture, styling and technology — the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The new design language was already applied to six models that include the all-new Sonata midsize sedan launched in March and the upgraded Grandeur sedan that made a market debut early this week.</p>
      <p>The Vision T concept also comes with a parametric air shutter grille that remains shut at standstill but opens in motion, helping the car improve fuel efficiency, the company said.</p>
      <p>Hyundai also introduced the RM19 high-performance concept car with a 2.0-liter turbo GDI engine at the media day for the LA Auto Show scheduled to run at the LA Convention Center from Friday to Dec. 1 (local time), it said.</p>
      <p>The maker of the Sonata sedan and the Palisade SUV began to develop a high-performance model under the project name of Racking Midship in 2012 as part of efforts to improve its brand image in global markets.</p>
      <p>Separately, Hyundai displayed the G90 flagship sedan under its independent luxury brand Genesis at the show ahead of its planned launch in the U.S. market next year.</p>
      <p>The company plans to launch the G90 mated with a 3.3-liter turbocharged gasoline or a 5.0-liter gasoline engine with an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>
