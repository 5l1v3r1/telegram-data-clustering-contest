      <h1>Senators press Amazon over doorbell camera security concerns</h1>

      <p><b>WASHINGTON</b> - A group of Democratic U.S. senators is questioning Amazon about the security of its Ring doorbell cameras following reports that some Ukraine-based employees had access to video footage from customers' homes.</p>
      <p>A letter to Amazon Wednesday from Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and four other Democrats said the internet-connected devices may pose national security concerns.</p>
      <p>News site The Intercept reported in January that Ring employees in the U.S. and Ukraine had access to personal data from cameras around the world. The report said Ring gave a variety of employees and executives access to recorded and sometimes live video footage from customers' homes.</p>
      <p>Besides citing the report, the senators noted that Ring devices routinely store video recordings and other data on Amazon servers.</p>
      <p>"If hackers or foreign actors were to gain access to this data, it would not only threaten the privacy and safety of the impacted Americans; it could also threaten U.S. national security," the senators wrote. "Personal data can be exploited by foreign intelligence services to amplify the impact of espionage and influence operations."</p>
      <p>The senators asked the company to explain its practices to address security vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>Ring says it's reviewing the letter.</p>
      <p>Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Christopher Coons of Delaware and Gary Peters of Michigan joined the letter.</p>
      <p>The letter comes after Markey on Tuesday released Amazon's responses to separate privacy and civil liberty concerns.</p>
      <p>In the response, Amazon said it has considered adding facial recognition technology to its Ring cameras, calling it a "contemplated, but unreleased feature."</p>
      <p>Amazon said there are no plans to coordinate such a feature with existing partnerships with law enforcement. Amazon has been encouraging police to tap into Ring's Neighbors app, a forum for residents to share videos of suspicious activity captured by their home security cameras.</p>
      <p>Markey expressed alarm that Ring may be pursuing face-scanning technology after a patent application showed the company is exploring a system that could flag certain people as suspicious and automatically alert police.</p>
      <p>More than 600 police departments have signed up to Ring's network since last year and many say it is becoming a useful crime-fighting tool.</p>
