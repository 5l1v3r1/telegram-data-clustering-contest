      <h2>Karan took part in national challenge to encourage young people to read</h2>

      <p>Derby College Group IT student Karan Pabla will soon have his name immortalised in print by a top author after taking part in a national challenge designed to encourage young people to enjoy reading.</p>
      <p>Karan, 20, who studies at the <a href="https://www.derby-college.ac.uk/">Joseph Wright post-16 Academic and Arts college</a>, was amongst thousands of young people and adults across the UK who joined the Reading Ahead challenge to read, rate and review a book of their choice.</p>
      <p>Everyone’s reviews were put into a prize draw by <a href="https://readingagency.org.uk/about/impact/002-reading-facts-1/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh9z3493z5QIVgrTtCh3kkQ_fEAAYASAAEgLFnvD_BwE">The Reading Agency</a> which organises the challenge.</p>
      <p>Karan’s review was picked out and his name will now appear as one of the characters in a future book in the ‘Vera’ series by best-selling crime-writer Ann Cleeves.</p>
      <p>Karan, a former pupil at City of Derby Academy, took part in the challenge during his GCSE Plus programme at JWC. Now studying IT, his goal is to go to university to study Cyber Security.</p>
      <p>Karan said: “I was not a particularly avid reader before this challenge but liked the idea of being able to choose a book that interested us and then review it. I love football so chose a book about the sport which I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
      <p>“I can’t wait to see my name in print – it is a huge honour – although apparently I am not one of the criminals! The book is due to be published next year so I will definitely buy several copies for all the family.</p>
      <p>“Reading Ahead has also encouraged me to read far more. I love being able to immerse myself into a book – whether it is fact or fiction – and just block everything else out.”</p>
      <p>Melanie Lanser, Director of Teaching, Learning &amp; Academic Research added: “Reading Ahead supports young people and adults by changing their perception of reading, opening up opportunities and building their confidence.</p>
      <p>“Research shows that when people to read for pleasure they benefit from far greater opportunities in everyday life, education and employment.</p>
      <p>“We are delighted that Karan has won the national top prize and I hope that this will inspire students here to join Reading Ahead in the future and also develop a love of reading.”</p>
