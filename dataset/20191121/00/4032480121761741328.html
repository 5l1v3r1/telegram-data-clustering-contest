      <p>Shares of Bitcoin mining machine maker <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CAN:US">Canaan Inc.</a> soared and fell in their trading debut before ending the day a penny below their offer price in its $90 million initial public offering.</p>
      <p>Canaan’s American depository shares closed at $8.99 Thursday in New York trading. Earlier, the shares rose as much as 44% and fell as much as 8.8% after Canaan sold 10 million shares for $9 each Wednesday, pricing them at the bottom of the marketed range.</p>
      <p>The Hangzhou, China-based company lost its lead underwriter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CSGN:SW">Credit Suisse Group AG</a>, before the IPO, according to its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Canaan had earlier listed the size of IPO at as much as $400 million.</p>
      <p>Twenty-nine companies based in China or Hong Kong have raised $3.34 billion in U.S. IPOs this year, about half the volume from the same period in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This year’s listings have fallen 9.6% on a weighted-average basis. That compares with a 7% overall increase for all U.S. listings this year and a 15% increase in the S&amp;P/BNY Mellon China ADR Index.</p>
      <p>Canaan filed to list in Hong Kong before the city’s exchange indicated that it was “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-28/chinese-bitcoin-mining-machine-maker-canaan-files-for-u-s-ipo">premature</a>” for crypto-related businesses to go public in the Asian financial hub. While Bitcoin has more than doubled this year to more than $8,000 on Wednesday, its value is less than half of its all-time high in December 2017.</p>
      <p>The offering was led by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/C:US">Citigroup Inc.</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1911:HK">China Renaissance Holdings Ltd.</a> and CMB International Capital Ltd. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CAN.</p>
