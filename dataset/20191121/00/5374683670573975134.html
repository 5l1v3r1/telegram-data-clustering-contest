      <p>IDF Spokesman Brigadier General Hedy Silberman addressed the latest round of fighting against Hamas.</p>
      <p>"We believe that activity against Hamas will be more complex and difficult to manage in relation to the war on the Islamic Jihad," said Silberman. "I'm coming from a briefing with the Chief of Staff. We're dealing with several arenas, near and far, and the situation is that the IDF is required in a large number of arenas."</p>
      <p>He said the north would be even more complex, because the number of rockets would be "much higher."</p>
      <p>After the ceasefire was imposed in the south, Silberman noted that the Black Belt battle plan had achieved its goals.</p>
      <p>"We achieved all goals within 48 hours," said Silberman, "we must continue to focus on the northern arena - Iranian activity is not just in Syria.</p>
      <p>"We used a small part of our capabilities, but we did not fight with Hamas, nor with Hezbollah or with the Iranians," the IDF Spokesman added.</p>
