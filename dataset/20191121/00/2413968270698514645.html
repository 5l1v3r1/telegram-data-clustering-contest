      <p>Mara Phones, a division of the Mara Corporation, recently launched the first African-based smartphone-manufacturing factory in Kigali. President Cyril Ramaphosa opened the second factory in Durban on 17 October 2019. Each factory has a capacity to produce a few million smartphones units per year.</p>
      <p>“We are exceptionally pleased that Nedbank has come on board to partner with Mara Phones, thereby enabling South Africans an opportunity to procure and acquire high quality and affordable smartphones. Our aim is to increase smartphone penetration on the continent by providing problem-solving, tailored solutions to our customers and partners.  This partnership strengthens our vision to change the narrative by demonstrating that Africans can produce high-quality tech products” says Chair of Mara Phones, Ahuti Chug.</p>
      <p>Ahuti continued, “Mara Phones is committed to enhancing and enriching the lives of the people of Africa by making smartphones more affordable to all.  The importance of quality and affordable smartphones cannot be overstated as they enable connectivity and efficiency.  It is part of Mara Phones vision and strategy to partner with financial institutions to offer solutions to consumers, truly Made in Africa solutions”.</p>
      <p>According to Ciko Thomas, Group Managing Executive for Nedbank Retail and Business Banking, the partnership resulted from Nedbank’s recognition of the close alignment of the Mara Phones philosophy with Nedbank’s purpose to use its financial expertise to do good.</p>
      <p>“Like Nedbank, Mara Phones is committed to leveraging technology to enable financial inclusion and enhanced education, healthcare and agriculture outcomes in South Africa and across Africa,” Thomas explains, “and through this transaction, the ability of both organisations to deliver on this vision will be significantly enhanced”.</p>
      <p>“As a bank that is absolutely committed to economic inclusion and development in South Africa, Nedbank is excited at this unique opportunity to put a top-quality, proudly South African mobile device in the hands of our clients,” Thomas says, “thereby helping them to see money differently and become even more effective at managing their finances.”</p>
