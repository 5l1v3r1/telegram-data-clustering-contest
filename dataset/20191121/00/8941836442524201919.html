      <p>MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) - Three of the six men charged in a shooting at a high school football game that led to the death of a 10-year-old spectator are due to make their initial court appearances.</p>
      <p>Michael Mack and Tyrell Dorn, both of Atlantic City, and Vance Golden, of Pleasantville, all face weapons charges and will be in court Thursday.</p>
      <p>The counts stem from Friday’s shooting in Pleasantville, which left a man and two children wounded. One of the children, Micah Tennant, died Wednesday from his wounds, while a 27-year-old man - who authorities have said was the target of the shooting - remains hospitalized in critical condition.</p>
      <p>A 15-year-old boy was treated for a graze wound.</p>
