      <h1>Our Solar System Is Blanketed in a Giant Wall of Fire</h1>

      <h3>Literal Firewall</h3>
      <p>At the outermost edges of our solar system lies a barrier of super-hot plasma — a giant wall of fire from the Sun that defines the edge of interstellar space.</p>
      <p>As Voyager 2 began its journey into interstellar space in late 2018, it recorded temperatures as high as 49,427 degrees Celsius (89,000 degrees Fahrenheit), <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/89000f-wall-of-plasma-solar-system/">according to <i>Nerdist</i></a>. And while the space probe seems to be fine, the plasma shield could pose a problem to NASA as it moves towards its <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-considering-interstellar-mission">planned interstellar mission</a>.</p>
      <h3>Defining Boundaries</h3>
      <p>Scientists are just now measuring the plasma layer, which was created and is maintained by solar winds that blow outward from the Sun to form a giant bubble, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0929-2">according to research</a> published this month in <i>Nature Astronomy</i>.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7530">release</a> from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the new research suggests that Voyager 2 may not actually be in interstellar space yet, but rather stuck in a wide transitional region made of incredibly hot, compact plasma just beyond the outer reaches of the solar system.</p>
