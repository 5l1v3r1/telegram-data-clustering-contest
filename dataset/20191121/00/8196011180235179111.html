      <p>Donoughmore captain Eileen Lyons is hoping Sunday’s All-Ireland Club Ladies JFC final can be the springboard for a bright future at the Cork club.</p>
      <p>National senior champions in 2001 and 2003, the Leesiders also competed in the 2004 and 2009 top-tier deciders. They then went through a difficult period of transition, arriving at a point where they couldn’t field a team for the county championship two years ago.</p>
      <p>However thanks to an influx of underage talent, Donoughmore have bounced back for another shot at All-Ireland glory.</p>
      <p>“At the start of the year we set out to win a county, so we’re in bonus territory. We’re going to be in an All-Ireland now. We’re going to be in it to win it. We got to a county semi-final last year and we were very disappointed after that. It’s great this year to have progressed. We work hard as a team, we work together. That’s important as well,” the full-forward acknowledged.</p>
      <p>“We were struggling for numbers for a couple of years, but it’s great to have a panel back in Donoughmore now again. There’s great girls coming through. We’ve a girl, Claudia Keane. She’s on the Cork minor team and others like her. It’s good to have and good to see in Donoughmore.”</p>
      <p>Keane is expected to line out at midfield this weekend, where she will be joined by legendary former dual star Rena Buckley. Despite announcing her inter-county retirement in 2018 — with a combined 18 All-Ireland winners’ medals to her name — she continues to exert a powerful influence on the club scene.</p>
      <p>“She’s great. When she talks at training you listen. She’s full of wisdom and a very smart footballer. She’s great to have in the panel. The likes of Aisling Barrett as well. Whatever they say in training you listen to,” Lyons said.</p>
      <p>Standing in Donoughmore’s way at Duggan Park, Ballinasloe on Sunday (throw-in 2pm) will be Mayo outfit CL MacHale Rovers — conquerors of Ulster champions Edendork St Malachy’s in the last-four. Full-forward Rachel Kearns was a standout performer in that game, amassing a haul of 1-9.</p>
      <p>It has been a memorable couple of weeks for Kearns, who was named as Mayo’s sole representative on the Ladies Football All Star team for 2019 last Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Lyons admits the Donoughmore defence will need to keep close tabs on her opposite number, while also being wary of the wider challenge posed by their unfamiliar counterparts.</p>
      <p>“She [Kearns] will be a scoring threat up front. It’ll take good girls to mark her. I don’t know much about them to be honest, only that Mayo football is strong enough. It will be a very tough test. Anyone that makes it to an All-Ireland anyway, they’re the two best of the junior competition,” Lyons added.</p>
