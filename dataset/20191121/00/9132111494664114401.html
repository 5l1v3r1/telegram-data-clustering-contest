      <p>Photos in which some Catholic bishops are seen laying their hands on the Auditor-General, Daniel Yaw Domelevo, have gotten people talking.</p>
      <p>Brother of the Auditor-General, Rev Brother Stephen Domelevo, a Catholic priest, shared the photos on his Facebook page with the caption, “Praying for Mr Daniel Domelevo the Auditor-General.”</p>
      <p>In the comments section, he writes, “I am praying for my Brother for his good work.”</p>
      <p>Among the bishops seen praying for him in the photos is the Metropolitan Archbishop of Cape Coast, Rev Charles Gabriel Palmer-Buckle.</p>
      <p>The post on Facebook received numerous comments some of which include, “[Uncle Daniel Domelevo] we know and the scripture also made it clear to us whenever we do the right thing in front of the enemy they stand against it. The Good LORD have [seen] you through already no Matter the tribulations. With the hands stretched toward you by the Good Shepherds of the church you are a winner.”</p>
      <p>The Auditor-General has been in the news for the past few months for what some say, are calculated attacks by some influential persons for his unwavering fight against public sector corruption.</p>
      <p>Recently, Executive Director at the Centre of Democratic Development (CDD), Henry Kwesi Prempeh, said there is a strong perception that Daniel Domelevo’s anti-graft stance was being stampeded by some government officials.</p>
