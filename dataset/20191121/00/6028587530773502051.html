      <p>The U.S. Department of Education <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-delivers-promise-provide-students-relevant-actionable-information-needed-make-personalized-education-decisions">released a much-anticipated, updated version</a> of the College Scorecard this week that includes, for the first time, information on the median earnings of a school's graduates, based on their chosen field of study. Combined with the program-level debt levels that were added to the Scorecard in May, it’s now possible for students intending to study geology, for example, to compare first-year earnings and student loan debt among geology programs at the various schools they are considering. Previously, the Scorecard, first introduced by the Obama administration and since revised under President Trump, displayed only median earnings and median debt at the institutional level. The Scorecard now shows the range of earnings for many of the academic programs an institution offers. </p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesleywhistle/2019/11/20/department-of-education-releases-earnings-data-by-major/#5528714a22dd">other contributors have noted</a>, the new Scorecard is a useful tool not only for students, many of whom consider earning potential as one factor in their college selection process, but also for university administrators as they evaluate the viability of their program offerings - particularly in an environment of shrinking enrollments and fiscal constraint.</p>
      <p>The enhancement of the Scorecard is clearly a welcome development. However, consumers should be aware of several caveats that limit what the new data actually mean. Here are six cautions to keep in mind when using the Scorecard, particularly when comparing the value or worth of fields of study at various colleges.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The data do not measure future earnings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The median earnings are for graduates’ first year in the workforce. They are not a measure of lifetime earnings, which are likely, depending on the field of study, to have very different trajectories.</p>
      <p>“In some fields of study, earnings change quite a bit the first few years out,” observed<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/11/21/federal-government-releases-earnings-data-thousands-college-programs"> Robert Kelchen</a>, associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall. “In other fields they may not change as much, because you basically enter at the top of the salary scale.”</p>
      <p><b>Not all students in a program are included</b>.</p>
      <p>Major groups of graduates are excluded. First, the data set includes only those graduates who received federal financial aid, either as loans or grants. That exclusion is likely to affect very different numbers of students depending on the college, and the excluded students most certainly come from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Second, the data do not include students who aren’t earning any income in their first year after graduation or who attended a school but did not finish.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Scorecard doesn’t include all programs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Academic programs with few students are excluded because the Department was properly concerned about the privacy of individual students graduating from small programs. <a href="https://www.educationdive.com/news/ed-dept-makes-student-debt-earnings-data-searchable-by-program/567753/">According to Third Way’s Michael Itzkowitz</a>, the data set includes only about 20% of all programs.</p>
      <p><b>Median earnings and loan debt estimates involved different students</b>.</p>
      <p>Two different samples of students were used to estimate median earnings and loan debt so consumers should be cautious in comparing the two. Earnings data came from students graduating in 2015 and 2016. Debt data, on the other hand, were collected from students who graduated in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p><b>Program level is not the same as major</b>.</p>
      <p>The Scorecard uses the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/Default.aspx?y=56">Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)</a> to define programs of study. This is not a taxonomy of college majors because the Scorecard uses four-digit CIP codes rather than the more granular six-digit codes, which the CIP also provides. Users should be careful in assuming that a field of study designated by four digits is identical to a specific major. Here’s an example: History at the four-digit CIP level includes nine concentrations at the six-digit level, including American, European, Asian, Canadian and military history - all of which could be separate majors at a given college.</p>
      <p><b>Transparency is not the same as accountability</b>.</p>
      <p>As many others have observed, when the College Scorecard was first launched, it was accompanied by regulations such as the gainful-employment rule aimed at academic programs, typically at for-profit colleges, that enrolled too many students whose subsequent income was swallowed up by huge student debt. The Trump administration has done away with the gainful employment rule, preferring a strategy like the Scorecard that increases transparency about college outcomes.</p>
      <p>Transparency and accountability are not the same. Transparency increases information. Accountability applies consequences. We need both, and Congress should push for both as it considers re-authorization of the Higher Education Act.</p>
