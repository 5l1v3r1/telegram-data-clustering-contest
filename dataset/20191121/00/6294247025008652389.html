      <p>MPILO Central Hospital’s maternity wing is overwhelmed by numbers of expectant mothers seeking its services thereby compromising service delivery.</p>
      <p>The hospital is attending to an average of 200 expectant mothers a day and delivering 35 babies or more yet its capacity is to deliver a maximum of 20 babies a day.</p>
      <p>The hospital’s clinical director Dr Solwayo Ngwenya said the wing has only 14 delivery beds and as such there was overcrowding.</p>
      <p>He said resources were overstretched and staff overworked thereby compromising quality of services.</p>
      <p>Dr Ngwenya said most expectant mothers were seeking services at the hospital because the services were free while council clinics were charging for the same services.</p>
      <p>“Under normal situation we are supposed to deliver an average of 20 babies a day but now its 35 or more babies using infrastructure and other resources meant for 20 deliveries,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dr Ngwenya said there is urgent need to increase staff and other resources to enable the maternity wing to cope with the increased workload.</p>
      <p>He said overcrowding had increased the risks of infection hence the need to expand the infrastructure as well as increase staff and other resources.</p>
      <p>Dr Ngwenya appealed to Government to unfreeze critical posts in midwifery to enable the staff to cope with increased demand for services.</p>
      <p>“At the moment we have about 200 midwives attending to patients 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. The ideal situation is that one midwife should be attending to a single patient but now a midwife is attending to three or four patients. By patients we mean waiting mothers, delivering mothers and those who would have delivered as they all require care,” said Dr Ngwenya.</p>
      <p>He blamed policy inconsistency between Central Government and local authorities which he said had resulted in expectant mothers seeking services at Government hospitals where the services were free.</p>
      <p>“When Government exempted expectant mothers from paying for services, councils continued to charge for the services hence this mass movement to Government hospitals,” said Dr Ngwenya.</p>
      <p>The hospital’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr Leonard Mabandi said the institution was working on modalities to construct another maternity ward to decongest the existing wards.</p>
      <p>“We are now screening the expectant mothers so that those in early pregnancy are separated from those about to deliver in order to reduce overcrowding,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, 71 general nurses and 58 midwives graduated at Mpilo Central Hospital yesterday at a ceremony held at the Large City Hall.</p>
      <p>During the graduation, Dr Mabandi said this year has been one of the toughest for the institution.</p>
      <p>“This year has not been easy, in fact it has been one of the toughest years in a very long time in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>“Our medicines are imported and need foreign currency and for that reason the supply of medicines has not reached our desired levels,” he said.— @michellzvanyanyan2</p>
