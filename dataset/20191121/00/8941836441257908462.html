      <p>FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) - Quarterback Matt Ryan and receiver Julio Jones returned to practice for the Atlanta Falcons and appear set to start against Tampa Bay.</p>
      <p>Ryan, nursing a sore ankle, and Jones, bothered by a sore foot, went through Thursday’s full session with no problems. Neither practiced the day before.</p>
      <p>Cornerback Desmond Trufant (toe) was a full participant, too.</p>
      <p>The Falcons (3-7) have won two straight as they prepare to host the Buccaneers (3-7). Atlanta might be without tight end Austin Hooper (knee), running back Devonta Freeman (foot) and defensive end Takk McKinley (shoulder). All three have yet to practice this week.</p>
      <p>Defensive ends Adrian Clayborn (groin) and John Cominsky (ankle) were limited. Safety Kemal Ishmael (concussion) will miss his second straight game.</p>
