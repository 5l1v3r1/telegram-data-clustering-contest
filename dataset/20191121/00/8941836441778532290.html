      <p>EAST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Authorities say a fox that was killed after it attacked five people and tried to attack a police officer has tested positive for rabies.</p>
      <p>Glen Ridge police say the first bite attack was reported Friday morning.</p>
      <p>As officers from that department and the Bloomfield Animal Control agency searched for the fox, authorities learned two other people had also been bitten.</p>
      <p>Officers found the fox about two hours later near the New Jersey Transit railroad tracks. It was euthanized after it attempted to attack one of the officers.</p>

        <p>The three bite victims were treated at hospitals for their wounds and haven’t shown any symptoms of rabies. But anyone who had direct contact with a fox in the area from Nov. 14-15 is being urged to seek medical attention as a precaution.</p>
