      <h1>Vindman's lawyer requests Fox News issue retraction over guest's espionage allegation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:15:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Catherine Garcia</a></address>
      <p>A lawyer for Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6555531-VIndman-Boies-LETTER.html">sent a letter to Fox News on Wednesday,</a> requesting that the network either retract or correct a "deeply flawed and erroneous" segment that aired during the Oct. 28 episode of <i>The Ingraham Angle</i>.</p>
      <p>Vindman is the National Security Council's Ukraine expert, and the <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/874943/fox-news-already-attacking-lt-col-alexander-vindman-next-house-impeachment-witness-msnbc-notes">segment aired</a> prior to his closed-door testimony as part of the House impeachment inquiry. Host Laura Ingraham said it was "kind of an interesting angle" that Vindman "is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president's interest, and usually, they spoke in English." Yoo replied, "I found that astounding. Some people might call that espionage."</p>
      <p>In his letter, lawyer David Pressman wrote that Vindman "had never in his 20-year career of service to his country been accused of having dual loyalties or committing espionage," which is a felony punishable by death. This falsehood was repeated by others, Pressman said, and Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient who served in Iraq, and his family "have been forced to examine options, including potentially moving onto a military base, in order to ensure their physical security in the face of threats rooted in the falsehood that Fox News originated."</p>
      <p>In a statement, Fox News said that "as a guest on Fox News, John Yoo was responsible for his own statements, and he has subsequently done interviews to clarify what he meant." Yoo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/alexander-vindman-fox-news-espionage.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage">told <i>The New York Times</i></a> in an email that he "didn't say that Lt. Col. was a spy or that he had committed espionage. I had no reason to question that he was doing his duty as an officer. But I think the Ukrainians are engaged in espionage against us." That argument, Pressman said, is "as legally irrelevant as it is factually incredible."</p>
