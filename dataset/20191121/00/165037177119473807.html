      <p>"Sometimes<b> it seems like you have to get injured in order to be given a foul</b>, Cuellar wrote on Instagram after being kneed in the face. </p>
      <p>In addition, the referee, Ricardo de Burgos Bengotxea and the VAR, Ignacio Iglesias Villanueva, did not give a foul. As a result,<b> Leganes presented a formal complaint to the RFEF</b>, saying that Cuellar had a bruise on his right hand. </p>
      <p>The rivalry between Suarez and Cuellar<b> comes from a long way in the past</b> when the goalie was still at Sporting Gijon. <b>The animosity between them is still noticeable </b>on the pitch. </p>
