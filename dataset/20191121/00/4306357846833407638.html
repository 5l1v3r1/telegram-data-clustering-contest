      <h2>Pat Nevin looks ahead to Chelsea FC's clash with Man City in the Premier League on Saturday night</h2>

      <h3>Pat Nevin has suggested that Chelsea FC have “little or nothing to lose” when they take on Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday.</h3>
      <p>The west London side head into the game in fine form, having won their last six matches in the top flight to leave them in third place in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC have been earning lots of praise for the performances that they have produced in recent weeks as Frank Lampard puts his faith in youth.</p>
      <p>The Blues are set to come up against a Manchester City side who will be keen to return to winning ways in the Premier League following their 3-1 loss to Liverpool FC last time out.</p>
      <p>Defending champions Manchester City will be the clear favourites heading into Saturday evening’s game at The Etihad.</p>
      <p>However, former Chelsea FC star feels that Lampard’s side do not have much to lose heading into the showdown.</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for Chelsea FC’s <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/11/19/pat-nevin--steep-learning-curve-for-young-blues---but-why-worry-">website</a>, Nevin said: “City are currently like a wounded animal, desperate to make amends for their mauling at Anfield two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>“On top of this, the game is away from home where City only lost three games in the two previous Premier League campaigns.</p>
      <p>“Even so, I must admit to looking forward to this game and I am not in the least apprehensive.</p>
      <p>“Every challenge these kids have been set, and there have been many huge ones already this season as detailed above, they have faced up to with bravery and the same ‘can-do’ attitude every time.</p>
      <p>“We are so far ahead of the expectation curve that this is almost a free hit with little or nothing to lose for us. City on the other hand have everything to lose.</p>
      <p>“If they do not pick up all three points then Liverpool might already be almost out of sight by the end of our game, if Jurgen Klopp’s men beat Palace at Selhurst Park earlier in the day.”</p>
      <p>For us, this in many respects is just another test of how far we have come in such a short time. Even if we lost heavily, it would not be a disaster, it would simply show us how high the next step is.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are aiming to try and maintain their place in the top four this season after they finished third last season under Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>The Blues will return to Champions League action on Wednesday night with a trip to Valencia.</p>
