      <h4>What are we looking for?</h4>
      <p>U.S. home-builder stocks with attractive valuations in a sector that has been outperforming the broad U.S. market.</p>
      <p>The SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (XHB-NYSE) is up 39.5 per cent year-to-date as it holds near record highs this month. Housing is strong in the United States and the market is reflecting it. Is there still value to be found in a booming home building sector?</p>
      <h4>The screen</h4>
      <p>We will be using Trading Central Strategy Builder to search for U.S. home-builder stocks that have good valuations combined with strong return on equity and low debt levels.</p>
      <p>We begin by searching for stocks exclusively in the home building and construction sector.</p>
      <p>We want companies with a strong return on equity ratio of 10 per cent or more to see how effective management has used invested capital to generate income. The screen will also focus on stocks with a price-to-earnings ratio lower than 14 in order to find below-average valued companies when compared with the average P/E of the S&amp;P 500 index, which sits at around 20.</p>
      <p>To focus on companies with low levels of debt in case interest rates start to rise again, we will also filter to include only companies with debt-to-equity ratios of one or less. The higher the ratio, the more leveraged the company is.</p>
      <p>Finally, we require a minimum market capitalization of US$2-billion because of the greater stability and safety larger companies offer.</p>
      <p>We have also included annual dividend yield, year-to-date and one-year return with a requirement of positive performance.</p>
