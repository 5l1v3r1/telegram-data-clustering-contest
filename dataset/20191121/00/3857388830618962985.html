      <p>Sudan's new transitional authorities, tasked with leading the way to civilian rule after the ouster of Bashir, have vowed to bring peace to these conflict zones.</p>
      <p>At the first round in October, Khartoum agreed to allow humanitarian relief into the three war-torn states, where years of conflict have left hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CONFLICT</b>
      </p>
      <p>The conflict in the western region of Darfur erupted in 2003 when ethnic African rebels took up arms against Bashir's Arab-dominated government, accusing it of marginalising the region economically and politically.</p>
      <p>Similar conflicts also erupted in South Kordofan and Blue Nile during the secession of Sudan's south from the north in 2011.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CHANCE AT PEACE</b>
      </p>
      <p>"The chances of achieving comprehensive peace in the country have grown" since the revolution, Taayushi said.</p>
      <p>"This paves the way for turning the page of war and realising the desired change to full democratic transformation and sustainable development."</p>
      <p>During the two weeks of talks last month, Khartoum announced a "permanent ceasefire" in the three conflict zones.</p>
      <p>An unofficial ceasefire had been in place since Bashir was ousted by the army in April in a palace coup that followed nationwide protests against his decades-old rule.</p>
      <p>Sudan is currently ruled by an 11-member joint civilian-military sovereign council, tasked with overseeing the transition to civilian rule as demanded by protesters.</p>
