      <h2>The company said its 2019 Fall product release includes more than 400 new features.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Amy Gesenhues</a></address>
      <p>Sprinklr, the once-upon-a-time social media listening and management tool that now bills itself as a customer experience platform, has released its latest list of fall <a href="https://blog.sprinklr.com/announcing-sprinklr-fall-2019-release/">product updates</a>. The company says it is rolling out more than 400 new features, with updates across multiple product lines. There are new integrations with Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Trustpilot, a “Smart Compliance” content review feature, a comprehensive planning tool for editorial calendars and more.</p>
      <p><b>The latest integrations.</b> Two major platform integrations announced by Sprinklr include Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Trustpilot. The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector that is now available across all of Sprinklr’s family of “Modern” products — marketing, advertising, research, care and engagement solutions — allows users to engage with their customers via social and messaging platforms within the Microsoft Dynamics 365 environment. “Or, social care teams can work within the Sprinklr platform and take advantage of seamless, bi-directional data synchronization with Dynamics 365,” reports Sprinklr.</p>
      <p>The Trustpilot integration, now part of Sprinklr’s Modern Engagement product, makes it possible to engage and respond to company ratings and reviews received via the Trustpilot platform. (The Modern Engagement product also has enhanced search options within the Social Asset Manager to locate assets more quickly.)</p>
      <p><b>AI-powered features.</b> The Modern Marketing product now comes with a “Smart Compliance” feature that the company says uses AI to review and analyze content — both text and visuals — so that the content complies with predefined campaign guidelines and ensures consistency across brand, voice and imagery details.</p>
      <p>There is also a new “Smart Bidding” feature that is part of Sprinklr’s Modern Advertising platform. The AI-powered bidding technology is designed to help advertisers determine the “ideal bid strategy” across channels and campaigns by identifying the lowest bid amount required to me meet pacing goals.</p>
      <p>Other AI-powered additions include a “Smart Quick Insights” tool that provides quick answers to questions submitted via Sprinklr Explorer (the research product), and “Smart Alerts” that provide real-time notifications about brand and competitor activity, for example, accelerated outbound publishing activity, surges in engagement or steep rises in follower counts.</p>
      <p><b>A Global Planning Timeline for ad campaign managers.</b> Sprinklr has rolled out a master Global Planning Timeline tool as part of its editorial calendar solution that lets advertisers manage non-social and paid campaigns across all channels, markets and business units.</p>

      <p>“The interactive timeline provides a single view of all planned content and campaigns with zoom-in, zoom-out and smooth scrolling features,” writes Sprinklr.</p>
      <p><b>Why we should care.</b> Sprinklr is investing heavily to join the ranks among leading all-inclusive marketing platforms. Earlier this month, Sprinklr CEO Ragy Thomas told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/11/07/well-look-at-starting-ipo-process-within-two-years-sprinklr-ceo-says.html">CNBC</a> that the company could announce plans for an IPO within the next 12 to 24 months. With these updates and integrations, Sprinklr can increasingly function as marketing teams’ planning and operations hub.</p>
