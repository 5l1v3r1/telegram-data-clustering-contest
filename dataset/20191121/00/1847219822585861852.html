        <b>Latvia maintained budget discipline in its next year’s budget plan, the deficit is within acceptable borders, but the tax portion’s decline before the economy generally does not allow for rapid increase of public expenditures, including wages, pensions and benefits, the European Commission admits.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Looking and the general government budget plan for 2020, the EC also admitted that it generally fits the Stability and Growth Pact. At the same time, the budget plan project in Latvia may cause a slight diversion from the state medium term budget goal.</p>
      <h3>The commission also notes that the previous tax reduction had resulted in a drop of the tax portion before the economy, which does not allow for rapidly increasing public expenditures, including wages, pensions and benefits.</h3>
      <p>«Structural deficit of Latvia’s budget for 202 is expected near the medium-term goal. Budget structure shows a decline of budget revenue and expenditures in relation to GDP. As a result of previously adopted tax reform between 2018 and 2020, budget revenue have declined by approximately 1 percent point from GDP, reducing also budget expenditure growth capabilities,» as noted by EC Vice-Chairman Valdis Dombrovskis.</p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>As reported, on 11 October, Latvia’s government approved Latvia’s general government budget plan project for 2020. In accordance with EU requirements, the budget plan was sent to the European Commission and Eurogroup for coordination.</p>
      <p>If the EC finds any critical violations of EU’s fiscal discipline requirements, the institution may reject the budget plan and request the member state to add changes and then submit it again. Additionally, EC may include recommendations for the plan’s improvement. The procedure provides that national parliaments take into account EC’s recommendations when approving budgets in final readings.</p>
