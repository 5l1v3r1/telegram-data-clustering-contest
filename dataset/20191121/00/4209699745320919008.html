      <p>The Nigerian Senate has passed the Finance Bill, which seeks to amend seven Acts of the National Assembly relating to taxes payable in the country.</p>
      <p>The bill, which scaled through on Thursday, seeks an increment of the value-added tax from five per cent to 7.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>It also seeks an increment in the companies income tax, Customs and excise, petroleum profit tax, stamp duties, personal income tax and capital income tax.</p>
      <p>Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, and Senators Ifeanyi Ubah, Gabriel Suswan and Abba Moro, however, raised objections to the bill, according to a report byÂ PUNCH.</p>
      <p>They said the increment in taxes would further compound the suffering and pains of Nigerians.</p>
