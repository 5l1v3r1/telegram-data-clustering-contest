      <p>According to the latest <i>Counterpoint Research</i> report, 46% of all smartphone sales in India happened online during the July-September period. This is a 55% increase over the same period last year and is the result of the large scale aggressive promotions during the festive season in India.</p>

      <p>Retailers Flipkart and Amazon were the preferred destinations for buyers. Flipkart in particular led the way with a 57% market share, followed by Amazon with 33% and Mi.com with 9%. According to Counterpoint’s own Anshika Jain, the growth in the online channel came as a result of the retailers’ shipping expansion to more regions, improved customer service and attractive discounts.</p>
      <p>In terms of brands, Xiaomi was once again the top seller with an estimated 38% of all sales during the period. This was driven by strong demand for devices like the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_7a-9716.php">Redmi 7A</a>, <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_7_pro-9521.php">Note 7 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_7s-9707.php">Note 7s</a>.</p>

      <p>Realme was the biggest gainer with very impressive yearly growth figures thanks to its affordable and feature-packed phones in the INR 15,000 and under range. Samsung did well too thanks to solid sales of the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_m30s-9818.php">M30s</a> on Amazon. vivo rode the wave of success backed on the increased demand for devices like the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_u10-9890.php">U10</a>, <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_z1x-9820.php">Z1x</a> and <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_z1pro-9743.php">Z1Pro</a>.</p>
