      <p>President Barack Obama appeared on stage with Marc Benioff, billionaire founder and CEO of  Salesforce, on Thursday at the software giant’s annual Dreamforce mega-conference in San Francisco to discuss many topics—including philanthropy, climate change and youth leadership—but one topic put Benioff to the test: the importance of diversity on corporate boards and executive teams. Obama stressed how important it was to have African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and women in leadership. “Marc, I think you’ve seen the data,” Obama said. “It shows that if you don’t have a bunch of women on your boards—do better.”   </p>
      <p>Benioff didn’t reply to Obama’s comment, but it may well have been directed to the Salesforce chief. The company’s board of directors has 12 members, three of whom are women (one is African American) and one other minority: an African American male. The software giant’s executive team also has 12 members, of whom three are women and only one member belonging to a minority group. </p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/center-for-board-effectiveness/articles/missing-pieces-fortune-500-board-diversity-study-2018.html?id=us:2el:3pr:diversity:eng:boardef:011619">study</a> published by the Alliance for Board Diversity, which looked at diversity for boards of Fortune 100 companies in 2018, the average percentage of board seats held by women was 25%. This puts Salesforce right in line with that average. But the company falls below the 19.5% average the study found for minorities on the boards of Fortune 100 companies.</p>
      <p>This is an issue that Benioff has acknowledged before. “Do we have enough women on our board of directors? Do we have enough women in our management team?” the billionaire asked in a podcast interview with <i>CNN</i> in November 2017. “The answer is generally no, we don’t.” Benioff has taken steps within middle management to equalize the playing field in his company, including dedicating $6 million between 2015 and 2017 to rectify pay gaps between men and women employees across Salesforce. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/marc-benioff/#4ad2c46a3ee0"><i>Forbes</i></a> estimates that Benioff has a net worth of $6.9 billion.</p>
      <p>The most recent woman to be appointed to the Salesforce board is Neelie Kroes, former vice president of the European Commision, who joined the board in 2016. The other two female board members are Robin L. Washington, chief financial officer of biotech company Gilead Sciences Inc., and Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. </p>
      <p>“Diversity is not charity,” said the former president of the United States, explaining that having different perspectives at the leadership level is actually crucial to running a corporate organization. “It is not something you do to be nice.” </p>
      <p>The conversation was neither live-streamed nor recorded, but could be watched in person or via four off-campus viewing centers in the heart of San Francisco’s financial district. Some 180,000 people registered for the Dreamforce conference, though it was impossible to tell how many watched the conversation between Obama and Benioff. Last year, an estimated 170,000 people registered to attend the massive conference. </p>
      <p>Perhaps with this nudge from Obama, Benioff will find the time to start looking for more female leadership on his board and executive team. </p>
