      <p>Christchurch track and field star William Stedman will vie for medals in two disciplines at the Tokyo Paralympics next year.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old, who lives in Hillmorton and goes to Middleton Grange School, put in a strong performance to take bronze in the 400m T36 final at the World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai.</p>
      <p>He also finished fifth in the long jump, which enhanced his belief he can compete in both events at Japan.</p>
      <p>“Next year, Tokyo 2020, medals in the long jump and the 400m is the goal,” he said.</p>
      <p>The 400m and 800m Rio de Janeiro Paralympic bronze medallist has cerebral palsy.</p>
      <p>He also competed in the T36 100m, 400m and long jump at the World Para Athletics Championships.</p>
      <p>He missed the final in the 100m but said he tried to conserve energy in the heats of his favoured 400m event.</p>
      <p>“I went out for the first 200m at my normal pace, just trying to get out fast and practice for tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“Then I had around 120m to go and saw that I was ahead so slowed down a bit, and then slowed even more for the last 50m."</p>
      <p>Stedman crossed the line in 54.28sec and the race was won by Australian James Turner in a new world record time of 51.71sec.</p>
      <p>Silver went to Evgenii Shvetsov of Russia in 53.18sec.</p>
      <p>“It’s the second fastest time I’ve ever run so I was pretty happy with that.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t quite run the first 200m quite as quick as I should have, so that may have affected the time slightly, but overall I think I ran well and I’m really happy with the bronze medal.”</p>
      <p>Stedman also competed in the long jump T36 final.</p>
      <p>He had a best jump of 5.39m and finished fifth overall in the competition.</p>
