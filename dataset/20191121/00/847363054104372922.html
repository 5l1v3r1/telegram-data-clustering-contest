      <p>Press Release – Business Central – Wellington<br/>Wellington’s increasing uptake of ultra-fast broadband will help cement our reputation as a creative capital where high-tech start-ups want to be.</p>
      <p>“The government’s fibre roll-out programme means 44 per cent of Wellington’s households and businesses are now accessing the internet at lightning speeds,” says Chief Executive John Milford.</p>
      <p>“This is really impressive infrastructure that enables businesses to dramatically improve their productivity and reach markets they could never dream of before.</p>
      <p>“It demonstrates what is possible when the government thinks ahead and partners with private companies to deliver 21st century infrastructure.</p>
      <p>“The government’s goal is to deploy fibre-to-the-premises to 87 per cent of the country by 2022, so far they are ahead of schedule having reached 87 per cent of their goal.</p>
      <p>“I encourage all businesses and families to check out their ability to access ultra-fast broadband and see for themselves how everyday tasks like watching a movie or doing their accounts can be made so much easier.</p>
      <p>“The challenge now is for more Wellington businesses to adopt faster broadband and the advantages it brings.</p>
      <p>“Wellington is home to an exciting mix of online companies and start-ups. Having innovative companies so close to their new customers will push further development.”</p>
