      <h1>DStv has the lowest repeat rate in the world – MultiChoice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/hanno-labuschagne" target="_blank">Hanno Labuschagne</a></address>
      <p>DStv boasts the lowest broadcast repeat rates in the world, according to MultiChoice General Entertainment CEO Yolisa Phahle.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a panel discussion at the Multichoice Group’s Media Showcase in Sandton on 21 November, Phahle defended the African broadcasting giant’s programming schedule against criticism regarding repeated shows and films.</p>
      <p>“We actually have the lowest repeat rate in the world, there’s just no question about it,” Phahle said.</p>
      <p>“Every time a supplier comes here or a third party channel, Aletta [General Manager of Content at Multichoice] will say ‘What more have you got?’ ”</p>
      <p>“How can we bring people more content and reduce our repeats and we’re always told that our repeat rate is incredibly low?” Phahle said.</p>
      <p>According to Phahle, the reason why South Africans still grapple with the issue of broadcast repeats is that the average African household watches twice as much television as the average consumer in the rest of the world – about five to six hours a day.</p>
      <p>“We have to have so many more fresh hours than other operators across the world,” said Phahle.</p>
      <h3>On-demand services improve sentiment</h3>
      <p>Phahle added that subscribers who have access to on-demand content on services like DStv Catch Up tend to be much happier with their choice of viewing.</p>
      <p>“We often find that where repeats are an issue, it is where there isn’t Catch Up. It’s where you can’t go and choose what you want to watch.”</p>
      <p>“People are used to being able to pick and they are used to people giving them recommendations based on what they like,” Phahle stated.</p>
      <p>She said that MultiChoice is constantly adapting its broadcast offerings according to the tastes of its viewers and to give them more choice.</p>
