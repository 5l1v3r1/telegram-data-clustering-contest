      <p>The U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed the release of the two Western professors and expressed hopes that their release would lead to ceasefire in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>“We join families of Kevin King &amp; Tim Weeks in celebrating their release from Taliban captivity. Thanks to President Ghani for his courageous support,” Trump said in a Twitter post.</p>
      <p>He added “Let’s hope this leads to more good things on the peace front like a ceasefire that will help end this long war. Proud of my team!”</p>
      <p>The Taliban group released the two kidnapped professors of the American University of Afghanistan on Tuesday, hours after three senior leaders of Haqqani network arrived in Qatar after being released by the Afghan government.</p>
      <p>The prisoner swap took place amid ongoing efforts to revive peace talks which President Trump called off following a series of deadly attacks in Kabul in September.</p>
