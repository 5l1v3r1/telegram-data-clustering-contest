      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/seagate-technology/"><b>Seagate’s</b></a> (NASDAQ: STX) operating margin has grown from 4% in 2016 to around 14.3% in 2019. This comes as a huge surprise, given that total revenue has dropped from $11.16 billion to $10.39 billion over the same period.You can view our interactive dashboard- <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/rlIPARv7/A-Look-At-The-Trend-In-Seagate-s-Operating-Margin?fromforbesandarticle=stx191121"><b>A Look At The Trend In Seagate’s Operating Margin</b></a>– to find out more about what drove this rapid growth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why did this happen?</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Seagate’s total operating expenses have dropped from $10.71 billion in 2016 to $8.9 billion in 2019.</li>
        <li>This has largely been due to a drop in the cost of revenue from $8.54 billion in 2016 to $7.46 billion in 2019, on the back of an overall semiconductor supply glut driving down raw material prices.</li>
        <li>A drop in memory demand has also led to a drop in product development and marketing costs, which have dropped by around $200 million each.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>What does this mean?</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apart from the semiconductor glut, Seagate’s revenues have also taken a hit due to a large-scale migration toward cloud storage and streaming services.</li>
        <li>With the semiconductor market expected to recover from its state of oversupply, Seagate needs to invest in research toward more relevant technology, or even consider making the switch to retail cloud services.</li>
        <li>This would, in the near-term, drive up both research and marketing expenses, and may weigh on operating margins going forward.</li>
      </ul>
