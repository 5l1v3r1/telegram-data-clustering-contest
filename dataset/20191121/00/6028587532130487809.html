      <p>Tomorrow’s <i>Fortnite </i>challenges have leaked online. The ‘Trick Shot’ mission bundle includes ten challenges and a special loading screen with the hidden letter “T” in it.The challenges were leaked by L<a href="https://twitter.com/Lucas7yoshi/status/1197093995530391558">ucas7Yoshi on Twitter</a>. They include a good mix of combat challenges, harvesting challenges, dancing and so forth.</p>
      <p>Here’s what to expect tomorrow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eliminations with 50 health or less (0/2)</li>
        <li>Consume Foraged Apples at The Orchard (0/3)</li>
        <li>Eliminations at Weeping Woods or a Landmark (0/3)</li>
        <li>Dance at the Pipeman, the Hayman and the Timber Tent (0/1)</li>
        <li>Gain Health with a Small Fry, a Flopper and a Slurp Fish (0/1)</li>
        <li>Eliminations with Pistols (0/3)</li>
        <li>Visit Named Locations in a single match (0/3)</li>
        <li>Damage with Shotguns (0/500)</li>
        <li>Save yourself from fall damage by landing in a Hideout (0/1)</li>
        <li>Heal yourself within 10 seconds after taking damage from an opponent (0/1)</li>
        <li>Search the hidden “T” in the Trick Shot Loading Screen</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are fairly interesting challenges. I like the “save yourself from fall damage” one because it reminds me of leaping off of towers into haystacks in <i>Assassin’s Creed.</i></p>
      <p>What I very much do not like is how Epic continues to lock challenges behind completion of other challenges, meaning you have to pretty much do them in order instead of completing the ones you want at your leisure. This is very annoying and has made me less prone to completing challenges this season (and in Season X) than ever before in this game. I find it really hampers my motivation.</p>
      <p>In any case, these will go live Thursday morning so stay tuned for all our guides and tips.</p>
