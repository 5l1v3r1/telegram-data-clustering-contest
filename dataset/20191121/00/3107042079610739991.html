      <p>Britain's Prince Andrew is stepping down from public duties for the foreseeable future after being engulfed in a scandal involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Andrew, the Queen's second son, denies an allegation that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre)  procured for him by his friend Epstein, the American financier who killed himself in prison earlier this year while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>

      <p>The scandal has escalated since Andrew's rambling explanations in a disastrous TV interview aired on November 16 left many viewers incredulous, and his apparent lack of compassion for Epstein's victims drew widespread condemnation.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued by Buckingham Palace, Andrew (59) said the scrutiny had become a "major disruption" to the work of the royal family and the charities associated with him.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission," he said.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>
      <p>Andrew recently apologised over his friendship with Epstein. He said he only visited Epstein's New York home in 2010 after his release from prison in order to break off the friendship. </p>
      <p>Epstein (66) was found dead in his  Manhattan jail cell on August 10. He had pleaded not guilty to the latest charges.</p>
