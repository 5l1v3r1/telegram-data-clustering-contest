      <h1>PayPal Buys Shopping Site Honey</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/dwr/" target="_blank">David Richards</a></address>
      <p>Popular discount shopping site Honey which is already profitable has been sold to Pay Pal for $5.8 Billion.</p>
      <p>Popular in Australia PayPal Holdings said that Honey is its largest-ever acquisition with up to 17 million people using Honey apps or web browser extensions to find discounts at online shopping sites.</p>
      <p>The start-up was profitable in 2018, PayPal said in a statement. Shares of the payments failed to move on the news.</p>
      <p>According to Bloomberg Honey is valued at almost twice what PayPal paid for its next-largest deal, iZettle, the Swedish provider of small-business services it purchased in 2018 and marks the first major acquisition this year.</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman has signalled that PayPal, with more than $10 billion in cash, is on the hunt for more deals after a string of takeovers last year that included Hyperwallet and Simility.</p>

      <p>Honey, which was founded in 2012, will keep its base in Los Angeles, and the founders will continue to run the business. The company’s services include a browser extension that automatically applies coupons at e-commerce sites. In a statement, PayPal said that Honey’s capabilities will give its customers a better shopping experience, and help merchants drive sales, partly with more timely and personalized offers.</p>
      <p>Mark Palmer, an analyst at BTIG, said the acquisition would help PayPal make “significant advances” toward becoming more relevant to users. It could also give customers and merchants a reason to choose PayPal “in the face of increasing competition from tech companies, such as Facebook Pay.”</p>
