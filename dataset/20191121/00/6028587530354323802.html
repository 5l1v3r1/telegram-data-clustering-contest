      <p><b>Topline</b>: As Facebook and Twitter have drawn attention for their policies surrounding misinformation in paid political ads, Google has largely stayed silent—until now. The company <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ads/update-our-political-ads-policy/">announced</a> Wednesday that it will limit microtargeting in political ads, but would not adjudicate each political claim or ban them altogether.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The policy update applies to paid ads from politicians including video ads on YouTube, display ads placed on third-party websites through Google’s ad network and ads that appear as search results.</li>
        <li>Before the change, advertisers could target ads to users with particular political leanings based on public voting records and other political affiliations. Now ads can only be targeted to users by age, gender and general location (based on zip code). </li>
        <li>Google’s VP of product management for Google Ads Scott Spencer wrote that the company will still allow contextual targeting, which would allow advertisers to serve ads to people based on what they were reading or watching (for example, targeting people reading about climate change or abortion).</li>
        <li>Spencer said the policy update also makes it more clear that “deep fakes” (doctored and manipulated media), misleading claims about the census process, ads “making demonstrably false claims that could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process” and ads falsely claiming that a candidate has died are prohibited.</li>
        <li>Google won’t fact-check individual political ads but will take action on “clear violations.” </li>
        <li>The policies will go into effect in the U.K. within a week, in the EU by the end of the year and in the rest of the world on January 6, 2020.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote</b>: “Of course, we recognize that robust political dialogue is an important part of democracy, and no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim, and insinuation. So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited—but we will continue to do so for clear violations,” Spencer said.</p>
      <p><b>News peg:</b> Leading up to the U.S. 2020 presidential election, Facebook and Twitter have been criticized for allowing politicians to lie in political ads. Facebook has said that it won’t fact check or remove false ads, citing concerns about free speech, while Twitter opted for banning political ads from politicians altogether. After intense backlash, Facebook is now <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/07/facebook-targeted-campaign-ad-limits-067550">considering</a> limiting microtargeting ads as well, though nothing formal has been announced.</p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Critics say that robust microtargeting in paid political ads allows bad actors to spread misinformation without accountability. “It is easy to single out susceptible groups and direct political misinformation to them with little accountability, because the public at large never sees the ad,” Federal Election Commission chair Ellen Weintraub <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/01/dont-abolish-political-ads-social-media-stop-microtargeting/">wrote</a> in an op-ed earlier this month. </p>
