        <b>Chris Berrow and Leigh Milner review Death Stranding.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chris - It's a really hard game to describe as to what on earth actually happens in Deathstroke. It's bonkers and it's. I'm going to say it's like delivery man simulator. So you're a guy called Sam Porter Bridges. OK but his name is Sam Porter. And then he works for a company called Bridges. But everybody seems to have the same surname as the company that they work for. So now he's Sam Porter Bridges. I can't explain this story because it genuinely doesn't make any sense. Like in a metal gear solid game is long cut scenes say why you wouldn't like this at all. So if you don't like essentially a film where you occasionally play then it is definitely want to miss. But you basically you pick up packages you take them from a to b and then you go to the next place you take it from a to b and your mission is to connect America back up again to the main base but your accent again. Now I think we're okay actually. No time no time. So you go from main mission control essentially you go to the next place delivering packages and you hook it up and they go Hooray. We've connected to the next hot point across America. Off you go to the next one and you just keep going and going and going. However there are some evil bad guys. And if you go to near them then everything goes black around you it's like oil. And the sea raises up from the ground in a massive way dark it is dark a massive whale attacks you. And it's doesn't really make any sense to you. You carry a baby on your front in a glass container. Ignore the story but I love it. </p>
