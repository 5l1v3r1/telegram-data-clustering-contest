      <p>During the third episode of the Borderlands Show, the first major and paid DLC for Borderlands 3 was announced. Launching on 19 December for PS4, Xbox One and PC, Borderlands 3 Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot will see players take on the “ultimate casino heist” with brand new missions, loot and more.</p>
      <p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-update-1-09-nerfs-the-already-nerfed-725-shotgun/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Update 1.09 Nerfs Already-Nerfed 725 Shotgun</a></p>
      <p>The DLC marks the first of four story expansions planned for the game and will be available as part of the season pass if you own the package. If you don’t, you will be able to purchase the content separately when it launches on 19 December 2019.</p>
      <p>The expansion will take players to Handsome Jack’s casino which is a giant space station taken over by psychos and Hyperion forces. Moxxi claims Handsome Jack stole all her designs to create the casino and sends the players to claim them back. There may be some riches in store for those who attempt the task.</p>
      <p>Borderlands 3 Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot will come with its own set of story missions, side missions, crew tasks, boss fights, cosmetics and of course legendaries. It will be accessible to anyone at or above level 13 in the main game and will scale to your level from that point. Players will be required to complete the opening prologue to access the content.</p>
      <p>Gearbox Software also revealed the plans for the Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite raid which is live on 21 November, and a number of changes coming to the game including a vault space increase, bug fixes and performance enhancements. Gearbox Software is also working on overhauling the Borderlands 3 Mayhem mode to what they are calling Mayhem 2.0.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, take a look at the reveal trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/handsomejackpot/">Borderlands 3 DLC</a> down below and prepare to raid the casino.</p>
