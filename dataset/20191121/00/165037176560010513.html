      <h1>The advantages and disadvantages of Luis Enrique's return</h1>

        <b>Robert Moreno's stage as the head of the Spanish national team is already in the past. Now, Luis Enrique starts his second spell in charge there and we ask ourselves: which players come out winning and losing (in minutes) with the change?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now that the drama has passed regarding the coach of the Spanish national team, the moment has arrived to analyse the different consequences that he could have on Spain.</p>
      <p><b>Luis Enrique's return</b> brings with him a series of changes in regards to what we saw with Robert Moreno. At least, that's what the minutes given out by the Asturian during his first spell in charge makes us think.</p>
      <p>It is true that he must consider the different moments that each player is having at their respective clubs. <b>Players on form and in a great state of mind,</b> injuries and other aspects that may have influenced both coaches choices in that precise moment.</p>
      <p>Luis Enrique based his starting XI for the Spanish national team, on players who Robert Moreno hardly gave protagonism to.<b> De Gea, Inigo Martinez, Ceballos, Isco and Morata</b> formed the back bone of Enrique's team, that disappeared with Moreno.</p>

      <p>The former coach trusted more in <b>Kepa, Albiol, Saul, Fabian and Gerard Moreno, </b>although the Villarreal forward has been involved in this start of the season as he has played a few games.</p>
      <p>Under Robert Moreno's orders,<b> Bernat</b> also went ahead of <b>Gaya</b> in left-back, just like <b>Jesus Navas did with Sergi Roberto.</b> In midfield, Rodri was also called to attention instead of <b>Busquets.</b></p>
      <p><b>Rodrigo Moreno</b> has remained with minutes similar to those that he had in Luis Enrique's first stage in charge, who also bet on a <b>Marco Asensio </b>who, being injured, has seen how <b>Mikel Oyarzabal</b> has gained prominence in the Spanish attack.</p>
