      <p>News from NZ Police<br/>Hutt Valley Police investigating arson at a school in September have arrested two people in relation to the fire.</p>
      <p>On the evening of Sunday 1 September, a large section of Upper Hutt College was extensively damaged by a fire, causing about $1.5 million damage.</p>
      <p>The damage led to the school being closed for two weeks, which meant significant disruption for the community.</p>
      <p>Yesterday and today, Hutt Valley CIB executed two search warrants in Upper Hutt and one search warrant in Palmerston North.</p>
      <p>During these warrants Police located evidential material and arrested two people in relation to the arson. They are due to appear in Youth Court at a later date.</p>
      <p>Fires such as these cause enormous harm to our community and can cause costly damage.</p>
      <p>Police hope these arrests reassure the community that we are committed to investigating acts of wilful damage and arson thoroughly, and holding those responsible to account.</p>
