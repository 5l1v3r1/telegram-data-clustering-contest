        <b>Ethan Ampadu is not enjoying the minutes he was hoping to have with his loan to RB Leipzig. Chelsea could cancel it and bring him back for the second half of the season, but this does not seem likely.</b>
      </p>
      <p>At least, this is what the 'London Evening Standard' states. <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/e-ampadu-319485/">Ampadu</a>, one of last season's revelations at <b>Chelsea</b>, went out on loan to <b>RB Leipzig</b> in the summer, but his situation leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

      <p>At this stage in the season, the young, <b>19-year-old</b>, has <b>only played 66 minutes</b>, in three games. He has <b>played more with Wales than with RB Leipzig</b>, to put things into perspective.Â </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/chelsea-fc">Chelsea </a>could, if they wanted,<b> cut the loan short and bring the player back</b>, either as a reinforcement for the second half of the season or to loan again to another club in which he is guaranteed more minutes, <b>but it does not seem that they are going to do so.</b></p>
