      <p>Former first lady <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michelle-obama/">Michelle Obama</a> was nominated for a Grammy Wednesday for her memoir’s audiobook.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michelle-obama/">Ms. Obama</a> may add the award to her mantle after she was nominated for best-spoken word album for the audiobook narration of her autobiography “Becoming,” which was released in November 2018.</p>
      <p>This could be <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michelle-obama/">Ms. Obama</a>’s first Grammy win but the Obamas third, as President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michelle-obama/">Obama</a> won in the same category for narrating his two books “Dreams of My Father” and “The Audacity of Hope” in 2006 and 2008, respectively. </p>
      <p>The former first lady will <a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/winners-nominees/219">face</a> off against John Waters’ “Mr. Know-It-All,” Sekou Andrews &amp; The String Theory, Eric Alexandrakis’ “I.V. Catatonia: 20 Years As A Two-Time Cancer Survivor” and Michael Diamond and Adam Horovitz’s for the “Beastie Boys Book.” </p>
