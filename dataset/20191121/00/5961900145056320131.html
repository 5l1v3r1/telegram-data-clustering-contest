      <p>Anyone who followed season 1 of Love Island Australia was shooketh to their core yesterday, when <b>Justin Lacko</b> announced out of the bloody blue that he’s expected une bebe next year.</p>
      <p>In case you missed it, Justin uploaded this Instagram:</p>

      <p>The second pic if you slide across is him and a girl we’d never seen before – whose account is (probably understandably tbh) set to private.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nowtolove.com.au/reality-tv/love-island/justin-lacko-baby-60422">Now To Love</a> got in touch with Justin off the back of the mysterious announcement, and he’s given a bit more background to the whole thing.</p>
      <p>The woman is <b>Anita Barone Scott</b>, and it turns out she and Justin were dating – although they aren’t anymore.</p>
      <p>“We aren’t together anymore but we are very supportive of one another and will be loving and caring for our child. Best friends for life,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also reiterated how exciting the news is as a closure on his 20s.</p>

      <p>“This is such a great feeling and a perfect way to celebrate the last year of my 20s,” he told the publication, adding that he will be making a “little Zoolander” out of the kid, which is mildly alarming because I don’t think he’s joking.</p>
      <p>Look, congrats Justin and Anita, and thank you for the wonderful tea you poured into Instagram yesterday because all I care about in this world is juicy mysterious life announcements from ex reality TV stars.</p>
