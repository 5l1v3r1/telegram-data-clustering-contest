      <p>Popular fetish priest Kwaku Bonsam says he is willing to serve as President of the proposed National Shrine if government goes ahead to construct it.</p>
      <p>The Minister of Chieftaincy and Religious AffairsSamuel Kofi Dzamesi has said government will not rule out the possibility of establishing a national shrine.</p>
      <p>According to him, some traditional groups have been canvassing for a national shrine and government will explore the possibility of constructing one.</p>
      <p>“Since I took office, as I said, we have a national mosque and now we are in the process of building a national cathedral. And few times, some traditional groupings have also approached me. There was a group of Wulom?i [Ga Traditional Priests] who also approached me and actually asked for a traditional shrine,” he disclosed at the Meet the Press series Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He continued: “I think that since the constitution allows freedom of worship, we will study it very well and see how possible that will also be. We are not ruling out traditional shrines”.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Starr News, Mr.Bonsam said building the shrine will ensure fairness on religious front.</p>
      <p>“We need a National Shrine also just like the Christians will have the National Cathedral. We also deserve it as citizens. When the National Shrine is built, we’ll need a leader and I’m ready to take on that task as a President of the National Shrine Association. The traditionalists have lots of herbs we can use to heal sicknesses. Enough of the foreign drugs,” he told Morning Starr host Francis Abban.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a lecturer of religion at the University of Ghana Ben Willie Golo has asked government not engage in matters of faith.</p>
      <p>“Government shouldn’t be biting more than it can chew. Let’s leave religious structures to religious bodies to take care of. Just as Christians who are citizens are given a National Cathedral, other citizens of different faiths will also make demands. That is what we are seeing. This national thing that has to do with religion is not necessary in a circular Ghana if you ask me”.</p>
