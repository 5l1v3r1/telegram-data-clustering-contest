      <h1>Review: The best offers on vehicles that come with winter tire credits</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Tai</a></address>
      <p>Drivers take the science behind winter tires for granted, but they could very well be the most important aspect of your vehicle during harsh Canadian weather. Comparing the size and weight of a vehicle with the small amount of rubber that connects the vehicle to the ground can provide some valuable perspective on the importance of winter tires.</p>
      <p>They have several advantages over all-season tires, such as 10 per cent more traction, improved responsiveness and shorter stopping distances, which make them <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/article-are-winter-tires-worth-the-investment/">well worth the investment</a>. Though winter tires don’t come cheap, some automakers are offering winter-tire credits to help customers put safety first.</p>
      <p>We’ve featured some of our favourite offers this week on vehicles that come with winter-tire credits. If you don’t find an offer that suits you, be sure to check out the <a href="https://buildandprice.unhaggle.com/buildandprice/?utm_source=DOW&amp;utm_medium=Content&amp;utm_campaign=DOW1_2019-10-28&amp;pid=2746">Globe Drive Build and Price Tool</a> to see the latest incentives and discounts on any new car, truck or SUV.</p>

Its new angular headlights, prominent fog lights and updated dynamic shield grille evoke the sporty design language pioneered on its sibling, the <a href="https://buildandprice.unhaggle.com/buildandprice/?make=Mitsubishi&amp;model=Eclipse+Cross&amp;utm_source=DOW&amp;utm_medium=Content&amp;utm_campaign=DOW2_2019-11-18&amp;pid=2746">Eclipse Cross</a>.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Mitsubishi RVR SE makes 168 horsepower and 167 lb.-ft. of torque thanks to a 2.4-litre, four-cylinder engine. Available All-Wheel Control gives the driver the ability to switch between two-wheel and four-wheel drive modes. An eight-inch multimedia display enables control of the SE trim’s six-speaker sound system and is compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. LED exterior lighting is standard on all 2020 RVR trims.</p>
      <p>For a limited time, <a href="https://buildandprice.unhaggle.com/buildandprice/mitsubishi-Canada/?%20utm_source=DOW&amp;utm_medium=Content&amp;utm_campaign=DOW2_2019-11-18&amp;pid=2746">Mitsubishi</a> customers can get up to $1,000 in credits with their purchase of a new 2020 Outlander, 2020 Eclipse Cross or 2020 RVR, which can be used either to reduce the purchase price of the new vehicle or purchase winter tires.</p>
