      <p>Sky News identified the stowaway as Paul Manyasi about a fortnight ago, opening up a Pandora's box as questions emerged on the real identity of the illegal passenger.</p>
      <p>According to the report by Africa Correspondent John Sparks, the "family of Paul Manyasi" had "confirmed" it was their son on board the KQ flight from Nairobi to London.</p>
      <p>But Kenyan authorities disputed the report, saying the man named in the report was not the dead stowaway.</p>
      <p>Paul’s ‘father’, who had been named by Sky News as Isaac Manyasi, also changed his name to Isaac Betti as the family denied any relations with ‘Paul’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MYSTERY DEEPENS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Betti told a local newspaper that his son’s name was Cedric Shivonje and that he was alive but in remand.</p>
      <p>Shivonje was arrested for defilement and locked up at the Industrial Area Remand Prison in Nairobi, he said.</p>
      <p>The Nation met Shivonje at Kamiti Maximum Prison, where he was moved to for security reasons.</p>
      <p>His emergence from the cell deepens the mystery of the hitherto unidentified stowaway, whose body is still in London. No family has claimed it.</p>
      <p>Flight records show the KQ plane had been to South Africa after taking off from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport en route to London on the early morning of June 30.</p>
