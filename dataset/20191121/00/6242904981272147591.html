        <b>Molde FK  have become the latest club to show an interest in Edwin Gyasi as CSKA Sofia brace themselves for a series of bids for their coveted Ghana winger.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Norwegian champions have been tabs on the player's situation after returning to Bulgaria following his loan spell at Major Soccer League side Dallas FC.</p>
      <p>Reports in Norway claim Molde FK have already made their move for the 28-year-old while Turkish media have added Trabzonspor and Besiktas  to the list of potential suitors that also includes Norwich and Wolves.</p>
      <p>A bidding war could push Gyasi's market value beyond the  £2 million mark.</p>
      <p>The Ghana international joined the Major League Soccer side on a season long loan from the Bulgarian side in July this year with an option to make it permanent.</p>
      <p>But the Ghanaian has been restricted by lack of playing opportunities, forcing him to cut short his loan contract, <a href="https://ghanasoccernet.com/exclusive-unhappy-ghana-winger-edwin-gyasi-to-return-to-cska-sofia-in-january"><b>GHANAsoccernet.com reports.</b></a></p>
      <p>The wideman is growing frustrated and has voiced his concerns over lack of playing time.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands-born winger has returned to the Bulgarian first-division team CSKA Sofia to sort out his long-term future.</p>
      <p>Gyasi will be keen to get back on the pitch to aid his return to the Black Stars.</p>
      <p>He has been capped fives time by the four-time African champions.</p>
