      <p>News from Taxpayers Union<br/>In the wake of Wellington City Councillors voting for a <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/117549172/first-things-first-wellington-city-councillors-vote-on-giving-themselves-a-pay-rise">28 per cent increase in their base salaries</a>, the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union is questioning Iona Pannett’s decision to take a second salary.</p>
      <p>Taxpayers’ Union Executive Director Jordan Williams says: “Iona Pannett is engaged in an extraordinary case of double-dipping. She’s paid by ratepayers for the full-time job of being a City Councillor, while also collecting a second sizeable salary as CEO of Birthright NZ.</p>
      <p>“Ratepayers forking out $111,000 for Cr Pannett’s full-time salary should expect her to be engaged in the role, not moonlighting for 30 hours a week running a nationwide NGO.”</p>
      <p>A Wellington City Councillor is generally expected to work 30-50 hours per week. The Taxpayers’ Union has been informed that Cr Pannett spends around 30 hours as Birthright CEO.</p>
      <p>“To make things worse, Birthright is largely taxpayer-funded, meaning Cr Pannett drinks from two public gravy pots at once.</p>
      <p>“As for the latest pay hike at Wellington City Council, it casts doubt on the Remuneration Authority’s fiscal sense. If the authority is willing to reward a heavily-indebted council with large pay rises, how can we trust it to determine MP salaries?”</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister gave the Authority the charge of determining MP salaries in August this year.</p>
