      <p>On November 20, 2019, the Los Angeles Clippers and Boston Celtics played an epic regular-season game with an intense playoff atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Some awesome highlights resulted, none bigger than the game-sealing block by Kawhi “The Klaw” Leonard, the Clippers newly acquired mega-star. It was a great play made by an all-world talent.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, as great as that play was, all <a href="https://nesn.com/2019/11/kawhi-leonard-gives-on-brand-breakdown-of-huge-dunk-ot-shot-block-vs-celtics/">everyone seems to want to talk about is his instant reaction</a>.</p>
      <p>Or more accurately, the lack thereof.</p>

      <p>As you can see in the clip above, Leonard barely reacts after making the game-saving play. He calmly walks off the court, barely looking anyone in the eye. In his post-game interview, Kawhi remains monotone. You can’t tell if he just won a playoff atmosphere battle or just ate a decent bowl of cereal.</p>

      <p>Media members gave a soft chuckle at his response, but this is an opportunity to look at something deeper. Let’s ask why Kawhi might have a problem emoting. To do so, let’s talk about a formative event in his teenage years.</p>
      <h3>The event</h3>
      <p>Kawhi’s father, Mark, used to own a Compton car wash. Kawhi would work there on weekends and during the summer. On January 18, 2008, Mark was shot and murdered on those very same business grounds. Kawhi was only 16 years old at the time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nba.com/article/2019/10/29/mark-leonard-kawhi-leonard-feature">NBA.com recently put out an article specifying the details of the crime</a>. Police still haven’t solved the case. And while Kawhi <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-sondheimer8mar08-column.html">decided to play basketball in a high school game barely a day after his father’s death</a>, he’s likely still dealing with the after-effects of that trauma now.</p>
      <h3>Trauma and Emotional Processing</h3>
      <p>Research shows that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">childhood</a> trauma has a lasting impact on an adult’s life. That impact can include changes to someone's ability to process emotions. A <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2014.311">study by Marusak, Martin, Etkin and Thomason </a>provided evidence that trauma-exposed youth were less able to regulate emotional conflict. They found evidence that:</p>
      <blockquote>"Aberrant amygdala response to emotional conflict was related to diminished reward sensitivity”</blockquote>
      <p>In other words, rewards drew less of a response.</p>
      <p>Sound like someone you know?</p>
      <h3>Silence of the Klaw</h3>
      <p>I’m not saying this is <i>the</i> reason Kawhi Leonard reacts the way he does. Accounts from Leonard’s friends and family express he was always more reserved. But it’s one more data point to help us understand one of the NBA’s most mysterious megastars.</p>
      <p>We expect NBA athletes to be showmen, especially those we recognize as perennial all-stars. Sport is an entertainment product, after all. That’s how endorsements are struck.</p>
      <p>But this gives us reason to empathize with Kawhi's lack of emotionality, and reminds us that even though a human can be <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/resilience">resilient</a> and thrive after trauma, <i>they still went through</i> that trauma. They still have to deal with the effects.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, we can all use this knowledge to be a little more understanding of the Klaw, and anyone else who’s suffered a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma">traumatic</a> event, in the future.</p>
