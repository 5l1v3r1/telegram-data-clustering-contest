      <h1>Trump awards arts medal to Jon Voight, Alison Krauss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/tom-howell-jr/" target="_blank">Tom Howell Jr.</a></address>
      <p>The star of “Midnight Cowboy,” a best-selling author, a versatile Grammy-winning singer and the man behind a 3-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michelin/">Michelin</a>-star restaurant in Virginia were among eight people awarded presidential medals recognizing achievements in the arts and humanities on Thursday.</p>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> showed special affection for Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight, an outspoken <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> supporter who once said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.</p>
      <p>“Actor and friend, Jon Voight is one of America’s greatest living legends in cinema,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> said at a medal ceremony in the White House East Room. “He has captivated audiences for more than half a century, starring in dozens of Hollywood blockbusters.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> said Mr. Voight’s performance as a boxer in “The Champ” was especially moving.</p>
      <p>“Everyone was crying at that movie. I tried not to, Jon, but it wasn’t easy,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> said.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> also awarded the Medal of Arts to Allison Krauss, a bluegrass, folk, gospel and country singer; Sharon Percy Rockefeller, a champion of the arts and wife of former Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia; and the musicians of the U.S. military.</p>
      <p>The arts medal was first awarded by President Ronald Reagan in 1985.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> awarded the National Humanities Medal to James Patterson, a prolific author and philanthropist, and Patrick J. O’Connell, a renown chef whose Inn at Little Washington in Virginia was awarded a coveted three <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michelin/">Michelin</a> stars.</p>
      <p>“I think the first lady and I will have to stop by very soon, because it sounds good to me,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a>, who unlike President Obama does not frequent capital-region restaurants — unless they’re located at properties bearing his name.</p>

        <p>The president also awarded the humanities medal to the Claremont Institute for championing the nation’s founding principles and to Teresa Lozano Long for promoting the arts through scholarships and philanthropy.</p>
        <p>The humanities medal has been awarded since 1997.</p>
