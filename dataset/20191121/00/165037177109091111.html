        <b>Granada defenders Germán Sánchez and Víctor Díaz received the all-clear on Thursday after training normally with the Granada squad at their training centre. They will be available for the match against Atlético Madrid on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Victor Diaz already trained on Wednesday at the <b>same pace as his teammates</b>, although it was not until this Thursday when he was discharged after missing the last match against Valencia due to a fracture in the lumbar transverse process.</p>
      <p>His team-mate Germán hadn't been training with the group all week due to a <b>muscular contracture</b> from which he has also recovered.</p>

      <p>Both defenders are <b>undisputed starters</b> for Granada manager Diego Martinez and are expected to be part of his team's starting XI in their home match against Atlético.</p>
      <p>The only Granada player who remains out, according to the medical report offered by the club, is Colombian central defender <b>Neyder Lozano</b>, who is recovering from a fissure in the tibia suffered in pre-season.</p>
      <p>Granada will complete their preparation for the match against Atlético with training, also behind closed doors, scheduled for this Friday in their training centre.</p>
