      <p>The Krontihene of the Sunyani Traditional Area in the Bono Region, Oboaman Bofotia Boa Amponsem II, has expressed dissatisfaction with police investigations into crimes and high rising murder cases, particularly, in the Sunyani Municipality.</p>
      <p>Nana Boa Amponsem II expressed worry that crimes and murder cases are on the increase in Sunyani, but police investigations to bring the perpetrators to book are unsatisfactory to the residents.</p>
      <p>He noted that a “suspected criminal or murderer named Desmond Adusei was hooked in front of his door on Friday dawn at 5:30 am on November 8, and handed over to the police in Sunyani, but, till date, the police could not interrogate to ascertain the suspect`s mission.”</p>
      <p>According to Nana Boa Amponsem II, “Adusei (the suspect), in his middle 20s, affirmed he was sent by one Charles Sekyere, and came to his house at 11:00 pm of Thursday night on November 7, till daybreak on Friday.”</p>
      <p>Nana Boa Amponsem II emphasised that “Adusei confessed before the police on Friday that he was sent by Mr. Charles Sekyere, from one Kwasi Duku`s family, who is the Chairman of Sunyani Tailors Association Zone Two.”</p>
      <p>“The suspect was given bail by Mr. Sekyere on Saturday without the police knowing his mission,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Krontihene was worried that his life was in danger, and the “entire Kronti family is living in fears if the police, who we know are our protectors, could not interrogate Adusei and the brain behind his mission in my house throughout that night.”</p>
      <p>“I am handicapped now, and I don’t trust the system, in terms of the kind of investigation conducted by the police,” he stated.</p>
      <p>This is “because, before this case, Mr. Sekyere had threatened to ‘de-stool’ me at a public gathering, and the suspect told the police he went to this same Mr. Sekyere for something that particular night, before coming to the house.</p>
      <p>“If the police, till date, have not been able to let him tell the actual thing he went for and interrogate this young man and his mission, then we are in danger in Sunyani,” Nana Boa Amponsem II said.</p>
      <p>“The police should be up and doing in their investigations, because people are living in fear and have no trust for police protection,” he entreated.</p>
      <p>“This confirms a press statement circulating about the insecurity situation in the city without police actions to curtail [the] canker,” the Krontihene said.</p>
      <p>“Ritual killing and sakawa boys’ activities in the Municipality are heightening, but no arrest has been done to serve as a deterrent, but it seems the police don’t care,” he stressed.</p>
      <p>Nana Boa Amponsem quizzed, “how sure am I if a different group would be contracted to accomplish such an agenda?”</p>
      <p>When contacted, Mr. Nicolas Aformanor, at the Criminal Investigations Department of the Ghana Police Service in Sunyani, confirmed the incident on Monday, and said the suspect was arrested on Friday, November 8, but had been granted bail, adding that the suspect would be sent to court soon.</p>
