      <p>Two Fijian nationals who arrived in Tauranga in New Zealand on a commercial vessel earlier this week, have been arrested for allegedly being in possession of at least 34 kilograms of methamphetamine on board.</p>
      <p>The NZ Customs Service says the drugs are worth NZ$17 million.</p>
      <p>The arrested men, both in their 30s have appeared in the Tauranga District Court.</p>
      <p>They face charges for the importation and possession of a class A controlled drug, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
      <p>The drug seizure has prevented up to NZ$42.1 million of potential social harm to New Zealand communities.</p>
      <p>The vessel arrived in Tauranga from Fiji on Monday and a subsequent search of the vessel located the methamphetamine hidden in bags in various locations onboard the ship.</p>
      <p>Approximately FJ$16,000 found onboard has also been seized by NZ Customs.</p>
      <p>NZ Customs Investigations Manager, Bruce Berry says this seizure is a reminder that Customs is active in seaports across the country.</p>
      <p>We will have moreÂ later this afternoon.</p>
