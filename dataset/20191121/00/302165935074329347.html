      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 21 — French luxury group LVMH has raised its bid to acquire US jewellers Tiffany by over US$1 billion (RM4.17 billion), two sources close to the matter told AFP yesterday.</p>
      <p>LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moet &amp; Chandon increased its bid for the storied New York-based company to around US$130 per share from US$120 per share, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The move lifts the overall value for Tiffany to around US$16 billion from US$14.5 billion.</p>
      <p>Neither LVMH nor Tiffany immediately responded to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>LVMH, which is led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, has sought to acquire Tiffany as a means to boost its presence in the US market.</p>
      <p>The transaction has also been seen as way forward for Tiffany, which has not matched some rivals in terms of sales growth in recent years.</p>
      <p>Some analysts have predicted a price hike would seal the transaction. — AFP</p>
