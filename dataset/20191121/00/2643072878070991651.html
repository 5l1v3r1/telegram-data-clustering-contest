      <p>The national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has sent a high powered delegation to resolve the crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the party.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State have been at loggerheads.</p>
      <p>Recall that <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/02/just-in-thugs-attack-obaseki-oba-akiolu-others-at-oshiomholes-residence/"><u><b>thugs attacked the convoy of Governor Obaseki, Deputy Governor Philip Shuaibu and the Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu</b></u></a> at Iyamoh the country home of Oshiomole.</p>
      <p>The Pro-Chancellor of Edo University, Iyahmo, Prof. T.O.K Audu was also in the convoy.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the youths carried out the attack in retaliation to an alleged<b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/13/thugs-attack-adams-oshiomholes-residence-in-benin/"><u> attack on Oshiomhole’s Benin City</u></a></b> home.</p>
      <p>The youths attacked the convoy after sighting the man alleged to have led the attack on Oshiomole home, Andrew Momodu.</p>
      <p>Obaseki, Oba Akiolu, Audu and other guests had attended the maiden convocation ceremony of the Edo University, Iyahmo, Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the Oba of Lagos alongside Obaseki were on their way to honour a lunch invitation at Oshiomhole’s house when the youths descended on their convoy.</p>
      <p>Following the attack, the state chapter of the APC <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/12/breaking-edo-apc-suspends-national-chairman-adams-oshiomhole-see-why/"><u>announced the suspension</u></a> of Oshiomhole from the party.</p>
      <p>In a counter-attack, the group in the state chapter loyal to the former Edo Governor, the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM) also suspended Obaseki and his deputy.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the national leadership of the APC announced that the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje will head the party’s five-member fact-finding committee to the state.</p>
      <p>Other members of the committee are: Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Bello Masari; former governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi; former governor of Borno State and serving senator, Kashim Shettima and Honourable Ahmed Wadada (Secretary).</p>
      <p>The Committee is expected to meet with all disputing interests and present its findings to the party, APC spokesman, Lanre Issa Onilu, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It recalled that <i>“that the party took a decision earlier in the week to constitute a committee of prominent party leaders on the lingering crisis in our party in Edo State.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“This marks another step in our party’s effort to find a lasting solution to the crisis and ensure our party comes out of it even stronger.”</i>
