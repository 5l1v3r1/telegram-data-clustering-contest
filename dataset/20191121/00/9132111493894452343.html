      <p>Chairman for Mines and Energy Committee in parliament, Emmanuel Kwasi Gyamfi, has said the National Democratic Congress (NDC) should forget about another term in government considering they have established themselves as the originators of power shortage also known as ‘dumsor’ in the country.</p>
      <p>According to him, the power shortage under the NDC was a ‘devil’ introduced by John Mahama brought a lot of torment to Ghanaians, especially on the job front.</p>
      <p>He however commended the Akufo-Addo administration for ending ‘Dumsor’ as soon as they assumed office.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Kwasi Gyamfi who was speaking on the floor of parliament during the 2020 budget debate Tuesday said the Akufo-Addo led government is delivering every promise they made in their 2016 manifesto and must therefore be praised. The achievement he says includes a massive facelift in the energy sector.</p>
      <p>“For almost 4 years, between 2012 and 2016 we were experiencing what we called dumsor. Dumsor was a devil that was introduced by the previous government led by John Mahama. It was a devil because it cost of dumsor to Ghanaians. Jobs were lost, lives were lost and people’s livelihood suffered. Never again would we allow NDC to come back to power to bring back dumsor.’ He said.</p>
