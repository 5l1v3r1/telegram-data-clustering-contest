        <b>Forward Andre Ayew is confident Swansea City can extend their unbeaten run when they face Millwall in the English championship on Saturday. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Swans have been on a run of three games without defeat after wins against Cardiff City and Wigan before drawing with Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The vice captain of Swansea has been a key cog in Steve Cooper's side's recent run of form and believes the team will get another against Millwall.</p>
      <p>“We will prepare properly. We’ve had good results in our last three games so we must make sure we hit the ground running again,” says Andre Ayew to the club's website.</p>
      <p>"“We want to try to get a good win at home against Millwall. It’s going to be a hard game but, with the quality we have, I’m confident we can get a result," he added.</p>
