      <h1>Made by Google releases fun ad for fabric Pixel 4 Cases [Video]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:55:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>Made by Google’s <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_4_case_fabric">fabric cases</a> for Pixel phones are widely regarded as being excellent and unique. Sold alongside the phone at most retailers, the company today released a short ad for Pixel 4 Cases.</p>
      <p>Posted to the Made by Google YouTube channel this evening, the Pixel 4 Cases ad is quite short at 15 seconds. It’s likely intended and most suited for viewing online.</p>
      <p>The general ad style is identical to the one Google has been using for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. It uses the company’s four primary colors and pink. It features sliding transitions and visual bursts with the cased Pixel 4 in every frame.</p>
      <p>All four case colors are shown during the clip: Could be Coral, Just Black, Blue-ish, and Sorta Smoky. Just like the device they protect, these names feel right at home and could very well be rejected Pixel 4 designations.</p>

      <p>The cases feature a microfiber lining to prevent scratching, and raised-edge to protect the camera bump and screen when the Pixel 4 is face down. Both the volume rocker and power button are covered, with the latter featuring its own splash of color. The nylon fabric exterior can be washed, while there’s a polycarbonate internal.</p>
      <p>“Google Pixel 4” appears at the very start of the video, while “Pixel 4 Cases” and a Google logo closes it out. There are no URLs during the ad, with all information in the video description along with the song used.</p>
