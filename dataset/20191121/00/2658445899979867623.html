      <p>Old Students Association of Acquinas College,Akure (ACAOSA) has spent about N100m on the development of the college.</p>
      <p>ACAOSA President  Justice Adesuyi-Olagbegi (retd) disclosed this while presenting some sports equipment to the school.</p>
      <p>The items were 20 pairs of ruuning vest and pants, 10 pairs of tights, 15 track suits, 15 pairs of soccer boots, 10 pairs of spike shoes and 15 pairs of hose.</p>
      <p>Olateru-Olagbegi noted that the philanthropic gesture of the association was borne out of its readiness to sustain and uplift the known standard of the college for qualitative  education.</p>
      <p>He added that it was obvious that the state government alone was incapable  of  funding and maintaining the set standard  considering the high wage bill of the government.</p>
      <p>According to him, the association has built 1,000-seater capacity hall, refurbished the school’s laboratories and renovated some dilapidated buildings of the school.</p>
      <p>The president, who stated that  the sport equipment cost N500,000, said that the equipment would boost  students’ morale to sport activities in the college.</p>

      <p>Olateru-Olagbegi, therefore, urged the state government to return the college to its original owner,the Catholic Mission,so that the school would not rest on its oars of success.</p>
      <p>He said the association during its visit discovered that the school’s situation was disturbing, troublesome and unacceptable.</p>
      <p>The Chairman of ACAOSA Sports Committee, Prof Babatunde Asagba, said  Aquinas college had made a unique landmark in sports and academics nationwide.</p>
      <p>Asagba frowned at the present state of sports in the college , adding that it should return to the golden years of the past.</p>
      <p>He said: “One of the reasons for this fall is the taking over of the school by the government.</p>
      <p>“We know it can be nursed to stardom again and to encourage this comeback to limelight in sports, the ACAOSA has decided to start supplying these sporting equipment for the use of students.</p>
      <p>“More shall come as plans are on the way to help surpass previous records of our alma mater,” he said.</p>
      <p>The state Commissioner for Education, Femi Agagu who was represented by Mr, Olabanji Ogundele, thanked the association for the intervention, saying  the gesture was highly commendable.</p>
      <p>The school’s principal, Babasola Ayibiowu, noted that it was a rare privilege to be a student of the college, saying  the school was doing well in national competitions both in academics and sports.</p>
