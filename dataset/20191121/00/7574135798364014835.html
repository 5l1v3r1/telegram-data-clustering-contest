      <p>You can browse our full <b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events">NYC show calendar</a></b> for all of tonight’s shows, but here are some highlights…</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/angel-olsen-installation-in-brooklyn-this-weekend-more-tour-dates-added/"><b>Angel Olsen, Zsela @ Brooklyn Steel</b></a><br/>Angel Olsen went in a more atmospheric direction on this year’s great <i>All Mirrors</i>, and she’ll bring the new songs to life — and play a few old favorites and probably her recent Mark Ronson collaboration — at her three-night Brooklyn Steel run, which begins tonight.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tours-announced-bob-weir-tennismolly-burch-colin-hay-protomartyr-more/"><b>Vagabon, Aerial East, Binki @ Villain</b></a><br/>Vagabon is opening a large chunk of Angel Olsen’s tour, but tonight she plays this free Noisey Nights show. Earlier this year, she released her first album for Nonesuch.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/fka-twigs-played-chicagos-riviera-theatre-pics-video-setlist/"><b>FKA twigs @ Kings Theatre</b></a><br/>It took FKA twigs over five years to finally release her sophomore album <i>Magdalene</i>, but it was worth the wait. It’s widely (and deservedly) considered one of the year’s best albums, and it’s proof that her hyped debut was no buzz-artist fluke. Tonight’s her second of two shows at Brooklyn’s gorgeous Kings Theatre in support of it. In the afternoon, she does a sold-out <a href="https://www.roughtrade.com/events/rough-trade-nyc-fka-twigs">signing at Rough Trade</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/robyn-hitchcock-shares-new-video-working-on-more-music-w-andy-partridge-expands-tour/"><b>Robyn Hitchcock, Tanya Donelly @ Murmrr Theatre</b></a><br/>This should be a terrific night of great songwriting via the always entertaining Robyn Hitchcock and Belly frontwoman Tanya Donelly. Hopefully they’ll do a few songs together, too.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/magnetic-fields-gothic-archies-future-bible-heroes-playing-stephin-merritt-nyc-residency/"><b>Future Bible Heroes, Stephin Merritt @ Symphony Space</b></a><br/>Stephin Merritt continues off his four-show Symphony Space residency tonight with a performance by Future BIble Heroes, his synthpop project with Book of Love’s Chris Ewen and Claudia Gonson.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/high-on-fire-power-trip-devil-master-creeping-death-announce-tour/"><b>High on Fire, Power Trip, Devil Master, Creeping Death @ Elsewhere</b></a><br/>This is a ridiculously stacked bill for fans of punk/metal crossover with long-running sludge greats High On Fire, modern-day crossover thrash staples Power Trip, rising thrashy death metallers Creeping Death, and rising blackened punks Devil Master. This is their first of two Brooklyn shows this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/weatherbox-share-new-song-playing-brooklyn-bazaar-one-off/"><b>Weatherbox, The Hotelier (solo), The Obsessives, Sal Show @ Brooklyn Bazaar</b></a><br/>Weatherbox went on hiatus a few years ago, but they recently started playing very select shows, and this is a rare chance to see them in action. It’s also one of the last chances to get to Brooklyn Bazar before it closes, and a rare chance to see The Hotelier’s Christian Holden in solo mode.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tours-announced-black-marble-jesca-hoop-beach-bunny-sheena-anika-augusta-more/"><b>Jesca Hoop, Chloe Foy @ Mercury Lounge</b></a><br/>Singer/songwriter Jesca Hoop recently released her very solid new album <i>Stonechild</i> and then guested on a new Elbow song, and now she’s on a tour that hits NYC tonight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dr-martens-presents-combo-chimbita-tickets-69775168407"><b>Combo Chimbita @ Barbès</b> </a><br/>Brooklyn tropical futurists Combo Chimbita, who have played Barbes many times, play this special.Doctor Marten’s presented show. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dr-martens-presents-combo-chimbita-tickets-69775168407">RSVP</a> here.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/david-byrne-now-on-broadway-cast-recording-released-check-out-an-opening-night-video/">David Byrne’s American Utopia @ Hudson Theatre</a></b><br/>David Byrne has retooled his acclaimed “untethered” 2018 for the Broadway stage and while the setlist and arrangements are much like what they were on his tour, songs are now threaded together with new monologues from Byrne, making for a much more theatrical experience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thekitchen.org/event/roland-p-young-and-l-rain"><b>Roland P. Young, L’Rain @ Public Records</b> </a><br/>The Kitchen presents this show featuring classically trained jazz clarinetist Roland P Young and L’Rain, the project of multitalented Taja Cheek.</p>

Bohannon @ Baby’s All Right</a></b><br/>It’s a late night DJ party whose tendrils stretch across Baby’s, with the great DāM-FunK, but the the other spinners are cool and diverse as well.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/microwave-discuss-10-songs-that-influenced-their-heavier-new-album/"><b>Boston Manor, Heart Attack Man, Selfish Things, Microwave @ Gramercy Theatre</b></a><br/>This post-hardcore package tour hits Gramercy Theatre tonight, and most of note to us are Microwave and Heart Attack Man, both of whom put out solid albums this year.</p>
