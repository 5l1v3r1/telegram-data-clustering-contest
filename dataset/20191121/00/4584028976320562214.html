      <p>Gregg Popovich cut a frustrated figure as he reflected on yet another defeat for the San Antonio Spurs, whose losing streak now stretches to seven games.</p>
      <p>The Spurs went down 138-132 to the Washington Wizards on Wednesday and have not endured such a torrid run of form since the 1996-97 season.</p>
      <p>It left coach Popovich in no mood to get too deep into analysis as he summed it up with some simple logical reasoning.</p>
      <p>"All in all, if you score 132 points, you should probably have a pretty good chance to win a game," he said.</p>
      <p>"The bad news is, if you give up 138, you are not going to win.</p>
      <p>"I'm a really smart guy. I'm figuring that's logical. I could be wrong. There's not much else to say."</p>
      <p>DeMar DeRozan struck an even more downbeat tone than his boss, despite his own contribution of 31 points.Â </p>
      <p>"Every single game we've lost feels worse than the last game," said the four-time NBA All-Star.</p>
