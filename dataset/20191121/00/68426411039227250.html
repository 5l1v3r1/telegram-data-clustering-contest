      <p>After 20 years of celebrating non-fiction writing, organizers say the RBC Taylor Prize will shut down next year.</p>
      <p>The Charles Taylor Foundation says the prize, which comes with a $30,000 cheque, will be awarded for the last time in March.</p>
      <p>First awarded in 2000, the prize honours late Canadian writer and historian Charles Taylor’s commitment to literary non-fiction.</p>
      <p>In a news release Thursday, the foundation says it became clear in recent years that its original mandate had been “more than fulfilled.”</p>
      <p>It says trustees and prize sponsor RBC Wealth Management conducted an “in-depth analysis” of the state of literary non-fiction and found the genre has developed into “a major component of Canadian publishing.”</p>
      <p>The foundation says it will hold a celebration of all past laureates before the final winner is announced.</p>
