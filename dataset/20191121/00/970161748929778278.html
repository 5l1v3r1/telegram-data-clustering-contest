      <p>Burns victims could soon no longer be scarred for life, thanks to a ground-breaking new study starting in the UK.</p>
      <p>The Scar Free Foundation has announced plans to launch the world’s biggest study of children with burns, in partnership with University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
      <p>Over at least the next five years, researchers will collect blood and small tissue samples from victims across Britain.</p>
      <p>They will then analyse the genetic information to try and identify factors and causes which lead patients to either scar badly or not at all.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>This will then create a bank of data, which the Scar Free Foundation hopes can be used to create a scar free world within a generation.</p>
      <p>For children like Elizabeth Soffe, five, healing her scars could mean being going swimming without any pain or not being stared at in the street.</p>

      <p>The youngster suffered extensive burns to her body at just six months old, after an air conditioning unit caught fire in her family’s home in Qatar.</p>
      <p>She has scarring to her legs, face and arms, and lost her hair, a lot of her fingers, part of her nose and one of her ears in the blaze.</p>
      <p>Parts of her body that weren’t burned were used to provide skin grafts and she has restricted movement due to scarring on her elbows, wrists and other joints.</p>
      <p>Answering questions with her mum Sinead, Elizabeth revealed that people often stare at her or say ‘mean things’ to her, including calling her ‘ugly’.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘My scars stretch and hurt and they are itchy, I can’t hold onto the bars in gymnastics because I don’t have very many fingers and it hurts my arms.</p>

      <p>‘People say mean things because I look different to them, but I know I’m beautiful.’</p>
      <p>Elizabeth has to have frequent operations and skin grafts, and her scars itch constantly which can keep her awake at night.</p>

      <p>She also has to have cream massaged into her skin several times a day and daily physiotherapy to help her movement.</p>
      <p>Her dad Liam said: ‘Elizabeth just wants to do the things that other five-year-olds enjoy – playing with friends, swimming and having fun.’</p>
      <p>Simon Weston, 58, was badly burned at the age of 20 during the Falklands War, when the RFA Sir Galahad was destroyed in the Bluff Cove Air Attack in 1982.</p>
      <p>He was the closest person to the bomb to survive and suffered severe burns to 46% of his body.</p>
      <p>The veteran is now known for his motivational speaking and charity work, and was awarded a CBE in 2016.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘As people with scarring, our contribution is as valuable as all the clinicians and the researchers. We’ve been the tapestry for them to work with.</p>
      <p>‘There’s a heck of a lot of work to do – we need to have something in place to minimise scarring and eventually eradicate it. To end up with a scar free world, wouldn’t it be wonderful?’</p>

      <p>It is expected that the new study will officially launch early next year.</p>

      <p>Brendan Eley, Chief Executive of the Scar Free Foundation, said: ‘The NHS provides excellent burn care within the boundaries of what is currently possible.</p>
      <p>‘However, we want to highlight that burn care – particularly the prevention of scarring from burns and scalds – has not moved on in the way that other areas of medicine have, which is why we need more medical research in this area.</p>
      <p>‘Burns patients tell us that they are most concerned about longer term scarring and the impact that it has on their movement and quality of life.</p>
      <p>‘We want to help people living with scarring achieve their full potential, as well as moving forward towards a scar free future.</p>
      <p>‘A cohort study would be groundbreaking – enabling us to map the DNA of an enormous range of children with burns, so we can isolate those factors which influence the severity of scarring and improve patients’ lives.’</p>
