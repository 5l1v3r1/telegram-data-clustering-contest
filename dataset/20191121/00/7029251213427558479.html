      <h1>EAC denies reports that summit was put off due to tensions</h1>

      <p>Arusha. The East African Community (EAC) denied yesterday that the heads of state summit initially scheduled for November 30 in Arusha was postponed because of regional tensions.</p>
      <p>EAC secretary-general Liberat Mfumukeko said cordial relations exist among member states, adding that reports that the postponement was an indication of widening cracks within the six-nation union were inaccurate.</p>
      <p>“The partner states work together. If one country is missing, no meeting will take place.</p>
      <p>“Any country has the right not to turn up provided its leader consulted with other presidents,” he told journalists at the EAC headquarters.</p>
      <p>The summit was cancelled because of lack of quorum after one member state, believed to be Burundi, reportedly requested for its postponement.</p>
      <p>Burundi asked that the annual meeting of regional leaders be rescheduled, citing important domestic issues, including preparations for the country’s 2020 elections.</p>

      <p>Mr Mfumukeko defended the EAC against criticism, saying it was unfair to focus on problems facing integration efforts alone without acknowledging notable achievements such as road construction.</p>
      <p>He said despite all the challenges, the East African region was more integrated today than some years back, thanks to infrastructure development.</p>
      <p>“There are things we need to appreciate. If our people are united, it is a big plus,” Mr Mfumukeko said, adding that pessimism hanging over the regional body was partly due to a scarcity of resources to implement some of its key projects.</p>
      <p>He added, however, that member states were still struggling with poverty.</p>
      <p>“EAC economies are still weak. We are not strong. Half of our citizens are still struggling in poverty.”</p>
      <p>Mr Mfumukeko said the infrastructure sector was the main beneficiary of the regional organisation’s drive to mobilise resources and coordinate implementation.</p>
      <p>He cited $2.5 billion in financial support pledged last year by the African Development Bank (AfDB) for implementation of various infrastructure projects in the region as a vivid example.</p>
      <p>The funds, extended as loans and grants, would be spent to implement major road projects, including construction of the $800 million (Sh1.84 trillion) Bagamoyo-Tanga-Horohoro-Mombasa-Malindi road.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, EAC deputy secretary-general Steven Mlote said the media has been unfairly criticising the community.</p>
      <p>He cited recent reports of delayed remittances to EAC coffers by some partner states despite the situation having improved.</p>
      <p>Mr Mlote said 40 per cent of funds expected from member states in the 2019/20 financial year have been remitted.</p>
