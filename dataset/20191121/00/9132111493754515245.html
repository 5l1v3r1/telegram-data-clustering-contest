      <p>Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo, the National Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), has said in an interview on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen program that the NPP government should stop deceiving Ghanaians.</p>
      <p>The General Secretary of the NPP, John Boadu, at a news conference on Monday, described as shocking the position taken by the opposition on the referendum and said it was a stab in the back because the NDC has been part of series of conversations on the referendum.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Ofosu-Ampofo in the interview monitored by MyNewsGh.com said all those allegations are false and the NPP government is just deceiving Ghanaians.</p>
      <p>“We have not stabbed NPP in the back. We have not met anywhere and there has been no agreement on the referendum so NPP should stop deceiving Ghanaians,” he said.</p>
      <p>Chairman Ofosu-Ampofo added that the NDC never took any decision on the referendum before a U-turn and their position is one and has been communicated.</p>
      <p>Chairman Ofosu-Ampofo, addressing a press conference to state the party’s position on the December referendum, urged Ghanaians to vote ‘No’.</p>
