      <p>LOS ANGELES -- The <a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-nominees-list">Grammy nominees</a> have been announced and it's a bittersweet honor for murdered rapper Nipsey Hussle.</p>
      <p>He received three posthumous nominations.</p>
      <p>His song "Racks In the Middle" is up for best rap performance and best rap song.</p>
      <p>"Higher" - a collaboration with DJ Khaled and John Legend that was one of the last songs Hussle recorded - is nominated for best rap/sung performance.</p>
      <p>Nipsey was shot and killed outside his clothing store in Los Angeles' Hyde Park neighborhood on March 31.</p>
      <p>Police later arrested Eric R. Holder, Jr.</p>
      <p>Holder and Hussle allegedly had a discussion or argument in front of the store that day, and Holder returned a short time later and started shooting, according to police.</p>
      <p>A judge earlier this month confirmed <a href="https://abc7.com/nipsey-hussle-murder-suspect-will-stand-trial-judge-rules/5698746/">Holder will go to trial,</a> rejecting a defense motion to dismiss the case.</p>
