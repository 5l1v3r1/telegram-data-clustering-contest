        <b>Europe’s leading airline <i>Ryanair</i> has been fined by a court in Spain that ruled that asking a fee for hand baggage is excessive.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50497629">British public broadcaster BBC reported</a> on Wednesday, November 21, Ryanair had been taken to court by a passenger, who had been fined by the airline for taking a bag in the cabin without a special ticket.</p>
      <p>The passenger was forced to pay a EUR 20 fine to bring her 10kg extra luggage on board.</p>
      <p>Ryanair allows only small bags as hand luggage if they can be stowed beneath the seat in front.</p>
      <p>The airline has a policy of charging customers an additional fee for carrying anything more than one personal item on board. Larger bags can also require a luggage fee.</p>
      <p>In its ruling, the Commercial Court ruled that the woman should be refunded with interest as it evaluated that the baggage could easily have fitted in the cabin, and ruled the policy to be null and void and told Ryanair “to remove it” from its terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ryanair not to change baggage policy</b>
      </p>
      <p>«This ruling will not affect Ryanair’s baggage policy, either in the past or in the future, as it is an isolated case that misinterpreted our commercial freedom to determine the size of our cabin baggage,» it said in a statement.</p>
