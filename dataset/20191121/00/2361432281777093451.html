      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/reid-nakamura/" target="_blank">Reid Nakamura</a></address>
      <p>Lizzie McGuire will reunite with her best friend Gordo in the upcoming Disney+ revival, with original star Adam Lamberg set to reprise his role, Disney announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Lamberg originated the character David “Gordo” Gordon on the original “Lizzie McGuire” series, starring opposite Hilary Duff for two seasons on the Disney Channel as well as in the follow-up theatrical release, “The Lizzie McGuire Movie.” He will return for the revival in a recurring role.</p>
      <p>“Gordo was an essential piece of the puzzle to what made the original ‘Lizzie McGuire’ so authentic and beloved,” said Duff, who will executive produce the revival in addition to starring. “I couldn’t imagine the series without him. I can’t wait for fans to see what he’s up to 15 years later and how he fits into Lizzie’s adult world.”</p>

      <p>As previously announced, Hallie Todd, Robert Carradine and Jake Thomas have also signed onto the revival to reprise their roles as Jo, Sam and Matt McGuire, Lizzie’s parents and little brother.</p>
      <p>The new “Lizzie McGuire” will pick up as Lizzie is just about to turn 30. Per Disney, “She seemingly has it all – her dream job as an assistant to a fancy New York City Interior Designer, her dream guy and a picturesque Brooklyn apartment – but things aren’t always as they seem. With a little help from her old friends and some new ones to come, her well-meaning family and her 13-year-old alter-ego in animated form, Lizzie navigates the ups and downs of adulthood.”</p>
      <p>Terri Minsky, creator of the original series, returns as showrunner and executive producer of the Salty Pictures, Inc. production. Hilary Duff and Rachel Winter will also executive-produce, while Ranada Shepard serves as co-executive producer.</p>
