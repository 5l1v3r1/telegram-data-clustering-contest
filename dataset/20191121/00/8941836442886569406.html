      <h1>Vanderbilt heats up in second half to beat Austin Peay 90-72</h1>

      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - When Vanderbilt’s top three guards are clicking, the Commodores are tough to beat.</p>
      <p>Wednesday was one of those nights.</p>
      <p>Aaron Nesmith scored 26 points and freshman point guard <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scotty-pippen-jr/">Scotty Pippen Jr.</a> added a career-high 21 to give Vanderbilt a 90-72 win over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/austin-peay/">Austin Peay</a>.</p>
      <p>Nesmith, the top scorer in the Southeastern Conference and league-leader in 3-pointers, hit four from beyond the arc and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scotty-pippen-jr/">Pippen</a> had three.</p>
      <p>“(Aaron) is getting shots and he’s doing it in a lot of different ways,” Commodores coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-stackhouse/">Jerry Stackhouse</a> said. “He’s not hunting them. He’s allowing the game to come to him. I can’t remember one that he really forced. When a guy’s got it going the way he’s got it going, you could take a bad one or two.”</p>

      <p>Nesmith, a 6-foot-6 sophomore, hit 10 of 17 from the floor, including 4 of 8 from 3-point range.</p>
      <p>“He never misses,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/austin-peay/">Austin Peay</a> coach Matt Figger said. “He was 17 of 30 (from beyond the arc) going into this game. He’s got size, a picture-perfect jump shot.</p>
      <p>I’ve known the kid since he was a freshman in high school because I was at South Carolina when he was at Porter Gaud (High School).”</p>
      <p>Saben Lee scored 19 points and led Vanderbilt (3-1) with a career-high nine assists.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scotty-pippen-jr/">Pippen</a> and Nesmith hit consecutive 3-pointers to give the Commodores a 46-42 lead early in the second half.</p>
        <p>Jordyn Adams led the Governors with a career-high 25 points, including four 3-pointers. Reginald Gee added 14 points and Terry Taylor had 13 for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/austin-peay/">Austin Peay</a> (1-3), which suffered its third consecutive loss, all coming on the road.</p>
        <p>“Whatever my team needed, I was just trying to provide,” Adams said. “It just wasn’t enough tonight.”</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt closed the first half with a 6-0 spurt to take a 38-37 lead. Lee’s second-chance layup with two seconds left capped the run as the Governors went the final 3:08 without a basket.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/austin-peay/">Austin Peay</a>: The Governors fell to 1-17 in the series against the Commodores. … They were outscored in the paint 44-12. … The Governors’ last win against an SEC team was in 2012 against Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt: The Commodores rebounded from Thursday’s overtime loss at Richmond with a second-half rally against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/austin-peay/">Austin Peay</a>. … It was the first of three games in six days for the Commodores.</p>
        <p>HEATED MOMENT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/austin-peay/">Austin Peay</a> assistant coach Sergio Rouco, who appeared to be upset about a Lee dunk late in the second half, had a short but heated exchange with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-stackhouse/">Stackhouse</a> in the handshake line.</p>
        <p>“Saben just had a lapse right there, but that’s something that I’ll correct with my team and not something that anybody else is going to correct with my team,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-stackhouse/">Stackhouse</a> said. “I’m always going to stick up for my guys. That’s all I told him. I’ll coach my team and you coach yours.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scotty-pippen-jr/">PIPPEN</a>’S BIG NIGHT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scotty-pippen-jr/">Pippen</a> hit 6 of 9 from the floor in 30:37 of playing time. “I was just getting what the defense gave me,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scotty-pippen-jr/">Pippen</a> said. “Some games it’s coming out and getting my teammates open, but tonight it was scoring.”</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/austin-peay/">Austin Peay</a> hosts Southeastern Louisiana on Saturday.</p>
