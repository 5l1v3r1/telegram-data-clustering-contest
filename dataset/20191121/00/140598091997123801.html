      <h1>Dr Richard Freeman downloaded research documents before ordering banned testosterone patches</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-sport/" target="_blank">Telegraph Sport</a></address>
      <p>Doctor Richard Freeman downloaded details from a website about testosterone-boosting drugs a month before he ordered the banned product Testogel to be sent to the headquarters of British Cycling and Team Sky, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2019/11/15/british-cycling-physio-alleges-shane-sutton-bullied-dr-richard/">a tribunal in Manchester</a> heard on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Freeman is contesting a charge by the General Medical Council (GMC) that he ordered 30 sachets of Testogel from an Oldham-based supplier, Fit4Sport. Freeman claims that he was bullied into sourcing the banned substance by head coach Shane Sutton to treat the Australian's alleged erectile dysfunction â€“ a suggestion that Sutton strenuously denies.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, a panel appointed by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, heard details about articles from academics which had been downloaded by Freeman.</p>
      <p>His laptops have since been seized by investigators. One of these articles concerned Sildenafil (usually known as Viagra) which scientists say can increase testosterone levels in men. It was downloaded in April 2011, a month before Freeman made his order for Testogel.</p>
      <p>Freeman also is said to have downloaded a 2008 article about the effects of endurance exercise on testosterone levels in men.</p>
      <p>Freeman has already admitted to 18 of the 22 GMC charges. He faces being struck off.</p>
