      <p>The General Secretary of National Democratic Congress has passionately appealed against the motion of introducing partisanship into the local government structure in Ghana.</p>
      <p>Explaining his party’s “No” vote campaign in the impending December 17 referendum on JoyNews’ Pm Express, Mr Johnson Asiedu Nketia tracked the history of Ghana’s local government system and why the structure was not diluted with partisanship by neither the British colonial rulers nor post-independent leaders.</p>
      <p>The former Deputy Agriculture Minister was deeply troubled about the fact that the current attempt to tinker with the structure of administring governance at the community level, will have dire consequences far more than any potential blessing.</p>
      <p>For instance, he said that making local government partisan will completely alienate chiefs from community leadership since the constitution debars them from partisanship.</p>
      <p>“Even having given them space at the local level they still complain that it is inadequate for which reason they are fighting for inclusion at the higher levels. What happens if you now go and exclude all of them up to the unit levels?” He asked.</p>
      <p>The following video has more of Mr Nketia’s presentation on Wednesday.</p>
