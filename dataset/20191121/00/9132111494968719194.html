      <p>The Weija High Court has slapped a GHC1,800 fine each on a commercial vehicle driver, Albert Ansah, 33 and his conductor, Francis Buabeng who brutally assaulted a police officer at Weija.</p>
      <p>The court presided over by Justice Bernard Bentsil imposed a fine of 150 penalty units each on the two.</p>
      <p>They will face 12-month jail-term should they default.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Prosecutors, the policeman was attached to the Visibility Unit of the Accra Regional Police Command and was on duty on the Kasoa-Mallam road to maintain law and order on the road on March 14, 2019.</p>
      <p>While on duty, Buabeng, who was driving a Sprinter bus, with registration number AW 855-14, parked his vehicle in the middle of the road and was loading, which obstructed other road users.</p>
      <p>The policeman approached the accused persons to move the vehicle to allow for the free flow of the traffic, but they failed to take the advice.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, a motorbike hit a private vehicle, after which the driver of the Sprinter bus drove off, while Constable Ekpe, who was riding a motorbike, gave him a chase and finally caught up with him at the Mallam Junction Bus Stop.</p>
      <p>The two men then pounced on the complainant and started beating him mercilessly.</p>
      <p>The assault was captured on video by a bystander who is yet to be identified, after which the video went viral on various social media platforms.</p>
      <p>Constable Ekpeâ€™s uniform was torn by the accused persons, who abandoned their vehicle in the middle of the road at the Mallam Junction and fled.</p>
      <p>A report was made to the Odorkor Police and the vehicle was towed to the police station and impounded.</p>
      <p>The two men were subsequently arrested.</p>
