        <b>Since joining Bayern Munich for a reported €10million from Borussia Monchengladbach, Michael Cuisance has made two Bundesliga appearances.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Michael Cuisance's</b> lack of game time at <b>Bayern Munich </b>shows he should never have left Borussia Monchengladbach.</p>
      <p>That is the view of Gladbach sporting director <b>Max Eberl</b>, who reluctantly sanctioned the French midfielder's<b> €10million switch in August this year</b>.</p>
      <p>Cuisance has made a pair of Bundesliga substitute appearances for Bayern, remaining unused on the bench on <b>11 other occasions in all competitions</b>.</p>
      <p>Minor adductor and groin setbacks have also hindered the 20-year-old, whose former club sit four points ahead of Bayern at the top of the table after 11 matches.</p>

      <p>"We told him for three months that he would have been better staying here <b>because he had found in Gladbach a club where he could develop</b>," Eberl told Sport1.</p>
      <p>"He had a great development last season. <b>He did not want to settle for that and had other goals in mind for himself</b>, which he has now pursued."</p>
      <p>Cuisance will hope the installation of interim head coach Hansi Flick brings about a change of fortunes.</p>
