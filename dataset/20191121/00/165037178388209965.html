      <p>The season has not started off great for <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United.</a> Ole-Gunnar Solskjaer's team can't get out of the middle of the table, so the 'Red Devils' will turn to <b>the winter market </b>to sign footballers that will push them into the European positions.</p>
      <p>One of the names sounding strong for the next market is <b>Borussia Monchengladbach</b> midfielder, <b>Denis Zakaria</b>, who has sounded more than once to strengthen United's midfield.</p>
