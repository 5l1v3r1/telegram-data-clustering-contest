      <p>Ranking member for Education, Peter Nortsu-Kotoe has said that the double track system and the situation of overcrowding in schools could have been avoided if government had completed some community day schools which were started by the erstwhile Mahama administration.</p>
      <p>He said “ Mr. speaker let us make sure that the budget makes provision for these schools so that they can provide the necessary needed quality education. That is why you realize that president Mahama, knowing very well that this problem will arise, started the 200 A blocks. 183 were at different stages of completion before they left office. Since 2017, only 27 have been completed according to the Deputy Minister for Education. What are they doing with the remaining numbers?” He asked</p>
      <p>“If they had completed these projects, I know very well that, that double track will not even come because we would have gotten enough space to accommodate students in our institution,” he said.</p>
      <p>In a rebuttal, Deputy Minister for Education, Dr. Yaw Osei Adutwum debunked the above claims adding that the double track is the engine for Free SHS and Akufo-Addo is transforming the education sector without making noise about it.</p>
      <p>“The era we are entering demands that we change things in our education system and that is what Nana Addo has empowered the Ministry of Education to do. We are transforming education without making too much noise about it but we know for a fact that we are doing basic STEM. We are changing education.”</p>
      <p>“…because of the good will of government GNPC have constructed 50 classroom block across the country” he added.</p>
