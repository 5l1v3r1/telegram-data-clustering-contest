      <h1>Exasperating Weather Could Make This Winter's First Gas Draw A Non-Event</h1>

      <p>According to popular winter lore, the higher the squirrel builds its nest before Christmas, the colder it’ll be. Weatherman John Belski says he spotted <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/weather/local/winter/2019/11/08/kentucky-weather-forecast-what-kind-winter-can-we-expect/3951459002/">squirrels nests at record heights</a> in Louisville, Kentucky early this month, suggesting frigid days ahead. How natural gas bulls would wish he was right.</p>
      <p>From early forecasts of super cold in the East Coast and other U.S. regions that use gas as the primary heating fuel, readings now show moderate chill at best — significantly diminishing the fortunes of those who bet big bucks on gas prices going stratospheric in their first major pre-winter breakout.</p>
      <p>Gas did rally beyond the expectations of many over the past month. But it did not stay higher, and we can blame the weather for that.</p>
      <h3>More Than A Third Of Early Winter Rally Wiped Out</h3>

      <p>At Wednesday’s settlement, the <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/natural-gas">front-month December futures contract</a> for gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled at $2.56 per million metric British thermal units. That was a staggering 35 cent drop from the eight-and-a-half month highs of $2.91 per mmBtu hit on Nov. 5.</p>
      <p>In just two weeks, bulls in the market have had to give back more than a third of the 21% bounty they had built between the closing week of October and the first week of this month.</p>
      <p>And there could be more pain for traders staying long, say those parsing both the latest winter readings and technical price charts.</p>
      <p>Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina, says he’s surprised December gas was still holding the $2.50 support.</p>
      <h3>Support At $2.50 Intact, But Eventual Price Looks LIke $2.30</h3>
      <p>Says Shelton:</p>
      <blockquote>“I thought $2.50 was the first level to get to. I still think that the spreads are going to weaken in 2020 with Q1 possibly flat to summer, which suggests that the eventual price is closer to $2.30.”</blockquote>
      <p>Dan Myers, analyst at Houston-based gas risk consultancy Gelber &amp; Associates, notes that gas for both April and May 2020 are already trading below $2.30 on expectations that the current oversupply in the fuel will push into next year.</p>
      <p>But like in the case of the December contract, the market is still hesitant to completely discount the remaining winter months through March, says Myers.</p>
      <p>However, that doesn’t mean it is poised for another major rally either, he says.</p>
      <h3>Oversupply Isn’t Helping</h3>
      <p>Adds Myers:</p>
      <blockquote>“Given the oversupply in the market at normal temps, a moderately cold to normal period isn’t enough to sustain elevated prices.”</blockquote>
      <p>Betting on something as fickle as the weather is never an easy thing, but that’s what the heating-and-chilling game of gas is all about.</p>
      <p>Traders surprised by the turn in the temperature over the past two weeks would probably wish the squirrels in Kentucky had been as accurate as the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2012/12/20/any-monkey-can-beat-the-market/#7df560bc630a">monkeys that beat Wall Street traders</a> by picking the right stocks. Considering how the stock market has performed all year, the human cousins of those primates can be considered a lot luckier, but that’s another story altogether.</p>
      <p>Back to the weather situation in gas, the pricing dilemma for the trade comes ahead of the first <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/natural-gas-storage-386">storage withdrawal</a> that the U.S. Energy Information Administration is expected to report today.</p>
      <h3>First Draw Of This Winter Could Be A Non-Event</h3>
      <p>A consensus of analysts polled by Investing.com shows the EIA could cite a withdrawal of 89 billion cubic feet for last week versus the previous week’s build of 3 bcf.</p>
      <p>In the normal scheme of things, that should have been enough to please the bulls.</p>
      <p>But not now, amid questionable demand for heating and unrelenting record highs in production week after week, says Myers.</p>
      <blockquote>“There is potential for last week’s demand to push an even stronger (storage) pull near triple-digits.” “Though this won’t quite match last year’s mid-November pull, it could come in nearly three times the size of the five-year average.”</blockquote>
      <p>“Nevertheless, the reversal to mild weather late this month will tamp down” the market, he adds.</p>
      <p>Dominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at the Energy Management Institute, says temperatures will be below normal in Western United States, with a potential for significant cold anomalies, especially in the northern Rockies/Great Basin.</p>
      <p>But above-normal readings are anticipated in the South Central/Southeast U.S. and more seasonable conditions are forecast across the North Central and Northeast, he says.</p>
      <p>Adds Chirichella:</p>
      <blockquote>“Confidence remains low during this time period, with a bit of model disagreement and poor run-to-run continuity, even among ensembles. Additional shifts in the forecast are likely as we get closer.”</blockquote>
