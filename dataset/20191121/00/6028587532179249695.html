      <p>There is no business school quite like the Harvard Business School. The MBA at Stanford GSB is more selective, the business school at Wharton has been around longer, the five-year ROI at Chicago Booth is stronger, the three-month placement rate at MIT Sloan is better, the aims achieved scored by Kellogg graduates are rosier, and the median base salary of Columbia MBAs is higher.But the HBS admissions office receives more full-time MBA applications than any other school. <i>Where and what did the 930 admits study before they went to Harvard?</i> </p>
      <p>Critics claim that the case method developed at Harvard is showing signs of its age, and naysayers fret that corporate scandals involving HBS graduates show few signs of slowing. It sometimes feels like the iconic business school on the banks of the Charles River is a punching bag for everything that is wrong with the business world.</p>
      <p>But no MBA matches the global brand recognition, network and pulling power of Harvard Business School. <i>Where did the 930 admits work before they went to HBS?</i></p>
      <p>Every year many thousands of strategy consultants, IB associates, and PE analysts join engineers, military and product managers throwing their hat into the ring to see if they are among the lucky ones to secure a place in the Harvard MBA classroom. And every year the school publishes a short summary of the incoming MBA Class, with the percentage of women, international students and U.S. ethnic minorities. They include average GPA and GMAT scores, and a broad sweep of undergraduate majors (Econ/Biz; STEM; Humanities) and pre-MBA industries.</p>
      <p>What if you could review not just every feeder college to the Harvard MBA, but could also see which undergraduate institutions in the U.S. and around the world supplied the most admits, and which majors were the most popular?  </p>
      <p>And if you could see which companies were the best and least represented, and the job titles candidates held when they successfully applied? That would give you a much better idea of the individual paths that caught the eye of the HBS admissions office.</p>
      <p>Well now you can: <a href="https://fortunaadmissions.com/2019/11/21/fortuna-admissions-harvard-business-school-mba-deep-dive-analysis/">The Deep Dive Analysis of the HBS Class of 2020</a> identifies the feeder colleges and companies for over 90% of the Harvard MBA Class. It has taken the Fortuna Admissions team weeks to compile, and the results are fascinating.</p>
      <p>Through Fortuna Admissions I have spoken at length with over ten thousand MBA applicants in the last eight years. That is slightly more than the 9,886 that applied to the HBS Class of 2020. Close to half indicated that they would apply to HBS. Of those, a growing number were pursuing an approach of Harvard, Stanford, Wharton or nothing. Many others were targeting the M7 or top 10 and wanted to try their luck with HBS. A few were encouraged by their family or friends to give HBS a shot.</p>
      <p>Whatever their motives, our discussion would inevitably end with the question, “So, Matt, what do you think are my chances?” By that time, we had discussed personal and professional achievements, reviewed GPA and GMAT/GRE data points, talked about recommenders, pinpointed patterns of leadership, assessed levels of engagement and positive impact, factored in the influence of their network, listened for signs of humility, and placed everything into the context of the over-represented and under-represented professional and demographic profiles that make up the HBS applicant pool.</p>
      <p>I wouldn’t say I’m the best predictor of HBS admission success outside of Dillon House, but in the words of Brian Clough “I’m probably in the top one”. Tongue-in-cheek immodesty aside, I’m always reminded of the words of my Fortuna colleague and former HBS Associate Director, Karla Cohen who says that “you can have an absolutely flawless interview on the heels of your exceptional application and still not get an offer.” </p>
      <p>The intimidating stats in the HBS Incoming Class Profile give a varnished image of outstanding credentials that can make admission to HBS feel like a moon-shot. Did I go to the right school? Are my employer credentials sufficient? </p>
      <p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattsymonds/2019/09/18/feeder-colleges-and-companies-to-stanford-gsb-deep-dive-analysis-of-the-mba-class-of-2020/">Deep Dive Analysis of the Stanford GSB Class of 2020</a> that we published last month – the most extensive Stanford MBA analysis ever published – we took on the research for an HBS class that is over twice the size. By meticulously sifting through LinkedIn profiles our team extracted the educational and professional backgrounds of 893 of the 930 admits who entered HBS last year. That gives us a 96% sample size, and a landslide of previously unavailable insights about what Harvard’s MBA Admissions Office really wants.  </p>
      <p>Some findings were no surprise: Nearly a quarter of the HBS class of 2020 has an Ivy League undergraduate degree, and some 21% of admits worked full-time for McKinsey, BCG or Bain (MBB) at some stage between college and heading to HBS. But would you have expected a state school like the University of Texas to send as many students to HBS as MIT (15), and more than Columbia (14)? Or that you can major in Industrial Management at the University of Cincinnati (US News Rank is 139) before building your career at Toyota in R&amp;D to win a seat in Harvard’s MBA classroom?  </p>
      <p>Here are some of the fascinating insights we lifted from our deep dive analysis of the HBS Class of 2020, and what it means for HBS hopefuls: </p>
      <p>
        <b>Elite feeder schools dominate</b>
      </p>
      <p>23.2% of MBA admits to HBS secured an Ivy League undergrad degree, and the top three feeder schools are Harvard (46), University of Pennsylvania (39) and the West Coast’s Stanford (35). In the Class of 2020 there are more graduates from Yale than from Brown and Columbia combined. Nearly half the class (49%) came from just 24 institutions, which each had 10 or more admits.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Surprises among the top feeder schools</b>
      </p>
      <p>Duke was the sixth highest feeder college, with 23 students, just behind Princeton. Notre Dame tied with Cornell to send 18 admits, while Georgetown accounted for 14, the same number as Columbia. The US Naval Academy with 12 admits had a clear edge over West Point in the Class of 2020, with Canada’s McGill University the biggest non-US feeder college with 6 admits. Collectively the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have provided 12 of the HBS Class of 2020. </p>
      <p>
        <b>HBS favors grad degrees, especially from Harvard</b>
      </p>
      <p>An impressive 213 admits already have another graduate degree on their profile. Ten have passed the bar exam and 20 are doctors. There’s clear preference for Harvard graduate degrees (roughly 1/3 of all graduate degrees) with Stanford a distant second. The most popular graduate degrees were in STEM, followed by Finance/Economics/Management degrees, and Public Policy. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Dozens of students earned their undergrad at a state school </b>
      </p>
      <p>You’d expect to see UC Berkeley well represented, which sent 10 admits. But that’s the same number as the University of Michigan and UNC Chapel Hill, and less than the 11 who come from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The top state schools are the University of Texas (15) and University of Virginia (12). The University of Kansas (US News Rank 130) featured for 4 admits, the same as Amherst College. And while many top research institutions are represented, there are also admits who hail from the Louisiana State, University of South Carolina and University of Nebraska - Lincoln. For the rankings obsessed among us, it may be heartening to see admits from respectively obscure colleges like St. Olaf College in Minnesota or William Carey University in Mississippi (US News rank 281).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Universities in the UK and India tie for sending the most students outside US</b>
      </p>
      <p>37% of the HBS Class of 2020 are international, but only one quarter of them earned their undergraduate degree outside the US, at institutions from 40 different countries. Graduates of universities in India and UK sent the most students (11% each), closely followed by Canada (10%). The University of Cambridge won hands down over Oxford in the boat race to HBS. Chinese universities sent very few students – we identified only 7 admits among close to 900 – but that may indicate that more Chinese students pursue undergrad degrees in the US. </p>
      <p>Nearly 5% of the class, or 44 students, earned their undergraduate degrees in South or Central America. Graduates from Chilean universities outnumber those from France, with University de Los Andes sending 6 grads. Admits from seven Brazilian universities are the most represented in South and Central America, with 17 admits. But there are also graduates with degrees from universities in Lebanon, Ireland, Taiwan, Ukraine, the Philippines, and Nigeria – just to name a few.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>McKinsey dominates among MBB feeder companies, Goldman for finance</b>
      </p>
      <p>McKinsey was by far the best employer to have worked for, sending 41 admits directly, while no less than 82 have McKinsey on their resume since graduating form college. By contrast, only 36 came directly from BCG and 27 from Bain. All told, MBB accounted for 104 (11.4%) of direct admits, and 21% of the class had worked at one of these three employers at some point. Among the Big Four there’s a strong showing by Deloitte – 8 admits came direct but 27 have the company on their resume – and Accenture also scored well (8 direct and 17 on resume).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Goldman Sachs leads among finance firms by a huge margin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Like McKinsey for consulting, Goldman dominates finance firms, sending 14 admits directly (44 on resume) versus 8 for Morgan Stanley (26 on resume) and 4 from Bank of America (17 on resume). Some 126 of the HBS admits we examined worked at some point for Goldman, JP Morgan, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America or Citi. But only 32 were admitted directly out of one of these – suggesting it is a good place to start out your career before moving on to other pursuits. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Big tech companies win favor at HBS over smaller tech companies or entrepreneurs </b>
      </p>
      <p>HBS seems to prefer big tech to smaller tech companies: Uber had the most direct admits of any tech company (11), with strong showings by Google (9 direct admits), Apple (7) and Microsoft (6). These numbers make us wonder, is the HBS class a bellwether of the unicorns that have peaked? When star employees see the writing on the wall they might start hedging bets with business school? In that case we can imagine that the HBS Class of 2022 will receive a glut of apps from WeWork staff.</p>
      <p>Only 21 students are entrepreneurs in a variety of disciplines, and only three of those are in tech apps/services. The largest startup segment was education, followed by nonprofit/social enterprise. This indicates HBS may be somewhat risk averse.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Good news for older candidates – some admits have 7, 8, even 11 years of work experience</b>
      </p>
      <p>Close to 100,000 Forbes readers have viewed a piece I wrote <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattsymonds/2016/03/08/why-older-mba-applicants-need-to-be-wiser/">about older MBA applicants</a>, and how they can leverage the experience they would bring to any MBA classroom. Sifting the stats in the HBS class offers a richer picture of what’s possible. While the average years of work experience continues to be 4.7, several admits spent more than 8 years in the workforce, like the Westpoint grad who majored in nuclear engineering and ascended the ranks to US Army Commander. But not all older candidates are military; there’s the Spanish &amp; Sociology major from Vanderbilt who hails most recently from Facebook. Or the Architectural Engineering major from U of Texas who spent over 8 years at Turner Construction Company. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What it takes: Fusing credentials with a captivating story</b>
      </p>
      <p>Take the Greek mathematician and professional handball player with a PhD in Education who’s passionate about helping kids learn statistics using digital games. While much of her career is at the intersection of tech and education, she found the time to found a startup in the hospitality industry. Or the French and Film major at University of Nottingham whose post college career includes stints in healthcare (Babylon health) as well as consulting with Strategy&amp; and finance at PwC. Then there’s the Boston U grad coming from the Boston Mayor’s office after a White House stint as a policy advisor for intergovernmental affairs.</p>
      <p>In our video strategy session, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/wat">What HBS Really Wants</a>, my Fortuna colleague Karla quipped that staying awake was her biggest challenge at application review time at HBS. Says Karla, “Once you’ve reached a certain level of exceptionalism in terms of being brilliant, dedicated and driven, it’s about your story.” </p>
