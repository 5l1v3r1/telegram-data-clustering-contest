      <p>The Crown is closing its case against the man accused of murdering Grace Millane, telling the jury the defendant "eroticised" the death of the British backpacker.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old denies murdering Ms Millane, who died in his apartment after they met on a Tinder date on the night of 1 and 2 December last year just before her 22nd birthday.</p>
      <p>His defence team says her death was accidental after they engaged in consensual choking during sex.</p>
      <p>Crown prosecutor Brian Dickey delivered the prosecution's closing address to the jury of seven women and five men this morning.</p>

      <p>Ms Millane's parents grew visibly emotional as Mr Dickey held up seven explicit photographs the accused took of their daughter's body, telling the jury they were "trophy" images.</p>
      <p>"When Grace Millane was dead he took that photograph there, when she was dead," he said.</p>
      <p>"We know he has a sexual interest in feet; in fetishes. He took that as well; he took those two of her; he took that one of her; and he took those; and she was dead.</p>
      <p>"He has eroticised the death of British backpacker Grace Millane, which occurred under his hand-hold, and on her birthday."</p>
      <p>He said the photographs showed the defence's proposition - that there was no motive in the case - was not true.</p>
      <p>Mr Dickey said while CCTV cameras had captured the pair's movements before and after Ms Millane's death, only they knew what happened in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>He told the jury they would rely on his actions after she died in determining his guilt.</p>
      <p>"What he did next will tell you so much about what he had done before. That is just normal, rational, deductive reasoning."</p>
      <p>Mr Dickey also told the jury the Crown did not have to prove murderous intent; that there was a second pathway of "reckless intent" to murder.</p>
      <p>"That is conscious risk-taking. If you kill somebody by conscious risk-taking in this country that is murder, and it has been murder in this country for generations and generations."</p>
      <p>He also pointed out that, by the defence expert's own opinion, it would take five to 10 minutes to cause death by strangulation and during that period the victim would pass out and the person strangling them would have to continue.</p>
      <p>"This defendant, this gentlemen in the back here, would have had to have her under his grip, suffocating her, strangling her, for a total of what would be approximately five to 10 minutes. At some point of which she lost consciousness and would have become under his hand-hold unconscious and limp and lifeless and he had to carry on. </p>
      <p>"And if that's not reckless murder in this country ladies and gentlemen, somebody will have to explain to me what is."</p>
      <p>Mr Dickey said it wasn't "sex play" or "restricted breath games"; telling the jury the photographs were powerful and inescapable evidence.</p>
      <p>"This is holding a person's neck and throat and wrapping your hand or hands around it, however you did it, for an extended period of time - feeling their struggle - and she must have struggled for her life, and going limp and going into unconsciousness, and you carry on."</p>
      <p>"That, ladies and gentlemen, is murder."</p>
      <p>The accused man's lead defence lawyer, Ian Brookie, will close the defence's case this afternoon before Justice Moore sums up tomorrow morning.</p>
