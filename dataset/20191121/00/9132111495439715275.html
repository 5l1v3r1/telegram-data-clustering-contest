      <p>The Minister of Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi has denied media reports suggesting government’s intention of building a national shrine for traditional worshipers.</p>
      <p>The report attributed to the Minister, had indicated that the construction of a shrine was a step in the right direction since Christian and Islamic faiths in the country will have a national cathedral and mosque respectively.</p>
      <p>“Since I took office, as I said, we have a national mosque and now we are in the process of building a national cathedral. And few times, some traditional groupings have also approached me. There was a group of Wulom?i [Ga Traditional Priests] who also approached me and actually asked for a traditional shrine,” he’s quoted by GraphicOnline.</p>
      <p>He continued: “I think that since the constitution allows freedom of worship, we will study it very well and see how possible that will also be. We are not ruling out traditional shrines”.</p>
      <p>But the Minister in a reaction on Anopa Kasapa on Kasapa 102.5 FM said the report is false insisting that he’d been misquoted.</p>
      <p>“I never said that; what is trending now is a misquotation and that’s not what I said. I never said government is going to build a national shrine as being purported.”</p>
      <p>He admitted that indeed there have been several requests for such project, but was quick to add that this was not a priority for government.</p>
