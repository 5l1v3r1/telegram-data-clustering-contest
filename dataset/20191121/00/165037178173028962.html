      <p>Milan finished fifth last season, missing out on a return to Champions League football <b>by just a point to city rivals Inter.</b></p>
      <p>They have had a poor start to this campaign and are <b>14th after 12 games </b>before they host last year's runners-up Napoli on Saturday in the San Siro.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic played for two seasons between 2010 and 2012 with AC Milan, helping them to their last Serie A title, and scoring <b>42 goals in 61 league appearances.</b></p>
      <p>He also won <b>three league titles with Inter Milan, and two with Juventus</b>, which were both revoked following the 'Calciopoli' match-fixing scandal.</p>
