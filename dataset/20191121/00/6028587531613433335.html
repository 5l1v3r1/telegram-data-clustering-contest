      <p>Google employees are holding a rally in San Francisco on Friday, November 22, to call for the reinstatement of two workers that the company placed on administrative leave for what those involved in the protest describe as retaliation for their organizing efforts. It’s the latest public action pitting Google workers against management, which in the past year has included protests on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/03/google-employee-protests-as-part-of-new-tech-resistance.html">company policies and business practices</a> and simmering tensions over issues like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/12/nlrb-orders-google-to-allow-employees-to-discuss-politics-at-work.html">information restrictions</a> and <a href="https://about.google/community-guidelines/">changes to internal communications</a>. </p>
      <p>Organizers of Friday’s rally describe the administrative leave of their colleagues as a “brute force intimidation attempt” and write that the employees placed on leave had spoken out about Google’s contracts with <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/14/20805562/human-rights-concerns-google-employees-petition-cbp-ice">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18758741/google-lgbtq-employees-sf-pride-removal-celebrations-san-francisco">hate speech on YouTube</a>, and other business and workplace issues. In a memo circulated internally, rally organizers call on co-workers to “demand an end to the escalating pattern of intimidation” and write that “together, we can save Google’s open culture.”</p>
      <p>The organizers also claim Google has increased surveillance of employees and cracked down on dissent since <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/01/google-employees-walk-out-in-protest-of-sexual-misconduct-handling.html">a massive employee walkout</a> about the company’s handling of sexual misconduct in fall 2019. They cite Google’s implementation of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/google-accused-of-creating-spy-tool-to-squelch-worker-dissent">a tool for tracking large meetings</a>, its work with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html?searchResultPosition=3">firm known for its anti-union efforts</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-war-over-diversity-inside-google/">changes to “community guidelines</a>” as examples of Google’s oversight.</p>
      <p>A Google spokesperson says that it investigates and takes action against violations of company policies, but denies the specific reasons that protest organizers say the two employees were placed on leave.</p>
      <p>In the past, employee activists at Google have successfully pushed for changes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/04/25/a-post-walkout-google-goes-public-with-updated-harassment-and-discrimination-policies-promises-to-listen/#794b68876b15">to the company’s arbitration policy</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/04/02/google-to-require-temp-and-contract-workers-to-receive-healthcare-and-parental-leave/#30a85067615e">contract worker agreements</a>, and halted efforts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/27/read-google-employees-open-letter-protesting-project-dragonfly.html">for censored search in China</a>, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html">contract with the Department of Defense</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/04/04/google-cancels-its-ai-ethics-board-less-than-two-weeks-after-launch-in-the-wake-of-employee-protest/#2f4e0dd6e281">an artificial intelligence ethics council</a>. However, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/11/1/20942234/google-walkout-one-year-anniversary-unionization-organizing-tech-activism-we-wont-built-it">trust between management and workers has deteriorated</a> in general, and organizers of Friday’s protest say that recent changes “make it harder for us to fight back on issues of systemic racism, sexual harassment, harmful technologies, hate speech on our platforms, and business relationships with organizations that engage in human rights abuses.”</p>
      <p>They write that placing the two employee organizers on leave is akin to “an attack on all people who care about transparency and accountability for tech.” </p>
      <p>The protest will take place near Google’s San Francisco office at 11 a.m. on Friday.</p>
