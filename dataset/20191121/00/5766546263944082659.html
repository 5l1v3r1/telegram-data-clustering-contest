      <p>Monrovia – Nobel Prize Winner Leymah Gbowee will headline the 4th Annual Kids Engagement Education Project fundraising dinner Saturday, as guest speaker, the organization announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>“This means a lot to us as when we started 5 years ago, the Gbowee Peace Foundation was the first organization that donated to our work followed by ActionAid Liberia,” says Brenda Brewer Moore, KEEP’s Executive Director.<br/><br/>The Gbowee Foundation has been a strong supporter of KEEP and Moore says the organization is looking forward to hearing a fountain of knowledge from the Nobel Laureate.</p>

      <p>Founded in in 2015, KEEP provides various resources that would facilitate access to primary education by engaging with parents, community leadership, established community structures and other partners. The organization also seeks to promote social justice and development of vulnerable children and youth by strengthening their capacities and envisages the upliftment of the Liberian children through educational empowerment regardless of social and geographic status.<br/><br/>With the support of its development actors, ActionAid-Liberia, Universal Outreach Canada, Monrovia Rotary Club, APM Terminals, Alpha Phi), KEEP has been able to reach more than 8,000 children and counting in 76 communities across rural and urban Montserrado, Gbarpolu and Grand Gedeh Counties in Liberia. It also has provided “Back-to-School” bags for beneficiaries in the greater Monrovia area with support from the Liberia Telecommunication’s Authority. Each book-bag contained one dozen notebooks, half dozen pencils, crayons, sharpeners, erasers, geometry sets, etc.</p>
      <p>In recent years, KEEP successfully completed several projects for ActionAid-Liberia by establishing Girls Forums in 10 communities in Gbarpolu &amp; Grand Gedeh counties and provided life skills training to the girls as well. We also created awareness to school administrators, parents, teachers and students on the rights of a child and the promotion of girls’ education in Gbarpolu. KEEP successfully coordinated and established after school tutorials for over 2000 children in Grand Gedeh &amp; Gbarpolu and provide life skills training.</p>
      <p>The organization has since transitioned in providing sustainable actions at the grassroot community levels – providing various support in the educational sector, particularly at the primary school level. KEEP also engages in women &amp; girls’ empowerment, economic livelihood, access to justice, promotion of rights in schools, strengthening youth education through computer and reading literacy programs, child sponsorship and advocacy.</p>
