      <h1>‘It’s interesting’: Sky Sports pundit discusses Mourinho’s appointment as Tottenham boss</h1>
      <h2>Jamie Redknapp has his say on Jose Mourinho's appointment as Tottenham Hotspur's new manager</h2>

      <h3>Jamie Redknapp has suggested that he is not sure whether Jose Mourinho is the right man for Tottenham Hotspur after he was appointed as the club’s new manager on Wednesday.</h3>
      <p>Mourinho has been brought in as the Lilywhites’ new boss after Spurs opted to sack Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night following their poor start to the new season.</p>
      <p>Spurs currently find themselves down in 14th place in the Premier League table, having won just three of their opening 12 games in the top flight this term.</p>
      <p>Mourinho takes over at the London Stadium after having spent around a year out of work following his sacking by Manchester United in December 2018.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach will be aiming to bring silverware to the north London club and will surely be hoping for backing in the forthcoming transfer windows.</p>
      <p>However, former Spurs midfielder Redknapp is not quite sure whether Mourinho is the right fit for the north London club.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/11865330/mourinho-named-tottenham-head-coach">Sky Sports</a>, Redknapp said: “Is he the right fit for Tottenham? It’s interesting, as Jose likes to spend money, and Daniel doesn’t, and Jose would want to get some really big names into the building.</p>
      <p>“He likes experience, and isn’t really one for playing young players, but you can’t argue with what he’s done in the game.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur will return to Premier League action on Saturday when they take on West Ham United at the London Stadium in what will be Mourinho’s first game in charge.</p>
      <p>They will then host Olympiakos in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday 26 November.</p>
