      <p>The University of Ghana chapter of the Tertiary Students Confederacy (TESCON) has in a statement debunked allegations by the General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress, Johnson Asiedu Nketia that the Deputy Commissioner of the Electoral Commission, Dr Bossman Asare once served as a patron of the Legon Chapter.</p>
      <p>In a statement copied to Ghanaweb.com the leadership of UG-TESCON described the assertion allegedly made by the NDC chief scribe in an interview on Okay FM’s morning show hosted by Afia Pokua on Wednesday, 20th November, 2019 as an ‘elaborate fictitious assertion’</p>
      <p>The group affiliated to the ruling New Patriotic Party in the statement stated that “Dr. Bossman Asare has at no moment in the history of UG-TESCON served as a Patron neither has he ever inched closer to our activities.”</p>
      <p>Describing the allegations as “a product of an overheated imagination orchestrated to justify what the group sees to be an impending loss of the NDC in the 2020 presidential elections,” the group outlined that Dr. Ebenezer Owusu, a senior lecturer and Head of Botany Department has been UG-TESCON Patron for well over a decade.</p>

        <b>Read the full statement below</b>
      </p>
      <p>The attention of University of Ghana TESCON has been drawn to an elaborate fictitious assertion by the General Secretary of the NDC to the effect that Dr. Bossman Asare, Deputy Chairman of the Electoral Commission of Ghana has served as a Patron of the TESCON chapter of the University of Ghana, Legon. Mr. Asiedu Nketia made this misleading statement when he granted an interview on Okay FM’s morning show hosted by Afia Pokua on Wednesday, 20th November, 2019</p>
      <p>We, without any fear of equivocation or contradiction, want to state that Dr. Bossman Asare has at no moment in the history of UG-TESCON served as a Patron neither has he ever inched closer to our activities. This is only a product of an overheated imagination in their continued orchestration to justify the final funeral rites of the NDC in the 2020 elections. For the avoidance of doubt, Dr. Ebenezer Owusu, a senior lecturer and Head of Botany Department has been UG-TESCON Patron well over a decade.</p>
      <p>As budding political activists, we look up to the calibre of Mr. Asiedu Nketia in view of his garnered experience as a veteran politician and we expect that he should be guided in his utterances and not fall for the temptation of pedestrian political commentary popular with the opposition NDC. It is sickening and unimaginable the extent the NDC operatives are willing to go, to engineer allegations out of thin air to pollute the political space.</p>
      <p>We, at University of Ghana TESCON, strongly take exception to the attempt to use our guild as a tool to debase and contaminate the political discourse. On the basis of this, we entreat the generality of the public to treat the assertion of Mr. Asiedu Nketia with the severest contempt it deserves.</p>
