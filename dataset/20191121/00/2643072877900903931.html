      <h1>Social Media Bill Not Targeted At Online News Platforms – Senate Spokesperson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/godiya-akwashik/"><u><b>Godiya Akwashiki</b></u></a>, has noted that the social media bill which has passed the second reading is not against the media.</p>
      <p>Senator Akwashiki stated that the bill targeted at <i>“regulating the activities of social media, people that are interested in posting things and to make sure you don’t post things that will harm your neighbour. It is not targeted at New Media”.</i></p>
      <p>The controversial bill which was sponsored by the Senator representing Niger East senatorial district, Mohammed Sani Musa, passed <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/20/social-media-bill-passes-second-reading-in-the-senate/"><u>second reading</u></a></b> at the Senate plenary on Wednesday, <b>Naija News</b> earlier reported.</p>
      <p>Akwashiki while speaking with the National Assembly New Media Forum on Wednesday stated that no cause for alarm as the bill is targeted at ending falsehood through social media platforms.</p>
      <p>When asked if the Bill had any relationship with the proposed regulations of social media by the federal government, Akwashiki said, the Bill was a private lawmaker’s Bill and not executive Bill sent by the Federal Executive Council.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker charged online news platforms to make a presentation for or against the bill during the public hearing, “if it is targeted at the New Media”.</p>
      <p>Akwashiki why speaking on President Muhammadu Buhari accusing the National Assembly of wasting N1trn on constituency projects said the President may have been quoted out of context.</p>
      <p>According to him, the President was yet to write to the National Assembly over the subject matter.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Quote me, the press can be funny sometimes. Maybe what we are reading is not the way Mr. President said it, and he has not written to National Assembly to say this or that. So, there is no cause for alarm or for anybody to disturb himself”.</i>
