      <p>The City of Hamilton says billions of litres of untreated wastewater spewed into a creek over a period of four years.</p>
      <p>The city says an investigation showed 24 billion litres of storm water runoff and sewage was discharged into Chedoke Creek between 2014 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The probe also showed the discharge happened after a bypass gate in the sewer overflow tank was left partially open on Jan. 28, 2014.</p>
      <p>The details of the spill, which was discovered in July 2018, were first reported by the Hamilton Spectator on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The city says its investigation could not determine why the gate was opened.</p>
      <p>It says it is working with the province’s Ministry of the Environment to figure out how to remediate the creek.</p>
