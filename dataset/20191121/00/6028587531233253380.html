      <p>Growing your e-commerce revenue, paying half of what you pay now for your website traffic, increasing the conversion rate of your landing pages – that all takes a lot of work, doesn’t it? After all, don’t substantial results always require major effort? Well, Tanner Larsson – the CEO of <a href="http://buildgrowscale.com/">Build Grow Scale</a>, a company which uses a process called “revenue optimization" with e-commerce brands like Guthy Renker, Discovery Channel, M Cuban Companies and more to grow and scale their businesses – believes massive results are often found in the details. “Just a 10% improvement of the right metric can radically change how many sales you make every month,” he says. He calls this “The magic of 10%.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Magic Of 10%</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the results that Larsson describes seem magical, it’s actually just cold hard math. “Imagine that you get 1,000 visitors to your website every day and you pay $500 for that traffic. You would then deduce that you’re paying $0.50 per visitor. Except, you’re not,” explains Larsson. “There are many different elements which affect your traffic costs, one of which many people overlook is their bounce rate, which reveals how much traffic hits your website and then just leaves – they bounce. Assuming that you have a 90% bounce rate, which isn’t that unusual by the way, the number of visitors who are actually viewing and considering your products or services drops to just 100 people. That is, 10% of your total website traffic. This means that you’re actually paying $5.00 per visitor, not $0.50 per visitor ($500/100 = $5) – that’s your real cost per visitor.”</p>
      <p>Bounce rate is an important metric for e-commerce stores because it reveals how many visitors view only one page and then leave. The higher the bounce rate, the worse the conversion rate and sales (typically). “By decreasing that bounce rate by just 10%, from 90% to 80%, e-commerce stores can cut their real traffic costs in half – from $5.00 to $2.50,” says Larrson. Since a 10% improvement in bounce rate doubles the amount of “real traffic” – from 100 visitors to 200 visitors (1,000 x 80%BR = 200). “Additionally, assuming that you have a 10% conversion rate on real traffic, you’ve also doubled your sales from 10 sales per day to 20 sales per day.” The best part is, you don’t have to spend extra money to drive that additional traffic or sales, you just have to optimize your store’s bounce rate. </p>
      <p>And the more traffic your store currently has, the greater sales impact you’ll see by improving your bounce rate. In fact, Larsson explains that a lot of big e-commerce stores still aren’t doing it right. “You’d be surprised. A lot of big-name brands just depend on massive ad spend to drive revenue. Their websites aren’t all that optimized, they have high bounce rates, high abandonment rates, and below-average conversion rates.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>How To Reduce Your Bounce Rate By 10%</b>
      </p>
      <p>Decreasing your e-commerce website’s bounce rate can generate more revenue and sales from the traffic that your website already receives. But, practically speaking, how do you actually do it? What changes can you make to quickly reduce the bounce rate?</p>
      <p>Larsson, who’s helped some e-commerce stores get their bounce rate as low as 35%, recommends focusing on speed to start: “Assuming that you’re branding is done right, that you have a decent conversion rate, and that you’re using social proof on your store, bounce rate is then heavily influenced by how quickly your store loads.” And the data is on his side; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2017/07/17/why-site-speed-design-can-make-or-break-your-google-ranking/#38391e773ce9">40% of users are likely to abandon a site</a> if it doesn't load within three seconds or less. </p>
      <p>“To improve load speed, you can use tools such as <a href="http://imageoptimizer.net/">Image Optimizer</a> to compress image size,” Larsson explains. “That includes logos, trust badges, product images, testimonial images – everything. We also remove any left-over code from previously removed apps and reduce the DPI on all images from 96 to 72, which doesn’t make a noticeable difference in visual presentation, but massively speeds up image load times.”</p>
      <p>“These are just the first steps – the low-hanging fruit to improving your load speed,” Larsson adds. “There’s clearly a lot more that goes into improving conversion rates, lowering bounce rate, and decreasing traffic costs. But these are a few steps that anyone can take to start seeing results right away.” </p>
      <p>As it turns out, just 10% can make a big difference. Big results don’t always require big action; they just require the right action. And you can use this simple strategy to improve the bounce rate of your own store by 10% and reap the benefits of reduced traffic-acquisition costs and an increase in sales.</p>
