      <p>This option has been reactivated by<b> the unity generated on club presidential nominations.</b> The absence of it was the main reason for Maradona's farewell from the club.</p>
      <p>Gabriel Pellegrino, current president of Gimnasia, was the main supporter of the arrival of Diego. But his figure, at first, <b>was out of the electoral race</b>, meaning they were convinced to let him leave.</p>
      <p>However, there has also been a change of plans here. Now,<b> his name could be included for some position, </b>which again activates the possible continuity of the technician.</p>
