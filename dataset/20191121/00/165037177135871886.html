        <b>Jose Manuel Llaneza spoke about the arrival of VAR to La Liga and made it clear that it is something that directly harms Real Madrid and Barcelona.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>VAR is currently in its second season in Spain.</b> Now fully in place, although constantly trying to improve, <b>VAR </b>should be that tool so that referees can decide more safely.</p>
      <p><b>Llaneza</b> also wanted to talk about this, who directly suggested that without it, Real Madrid and Barcelona would have more points due to the referee's mistakes. <b>A statement that will not go unnoticed.</b></p>

      <p>"There is equality, <b>the six or seven points that Madrid and Barça would have are gone</b>. Now they are wrong with them and against them," said the vice president of Villarreal to 'AS'.</p>
      <p>"Nor do they agree with VAR because<b> those six or seven points are gone.</b> Before, a play at the edge of the doubtful area was a penalty for them. <b>That possibility soon went away.</b>.." he closed.</p>
