      <p>WWE got on the board with its first ratings win of the Wednesday Night Wars, and it certainly wasn’t for a lack of effort with a loaded NXT show that boasted the biggest stars across all three shows ahead of WWE Survivor Series. Following <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/11/14/aew-dynamite-trounces-wwe-nxt-in-seventh-straight-ratings-win/#47671ee749ff">last week’s decisive victory</a> for AEW Dynamite, WWE NXT drew an average viewership of 916,000, up 22% from 750,000<b> </b>viewers last week and its highest number since the September 25 broadcast. NXT also shot up to No. 14 for the night among the 18-49 demographic.</p>
      <p>AEW Dynamite <a href="http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-11-20-2019.html">garnered 893,000 viewers</a>—down 7% from 957,000 last week. Despite losing this week’s ratings tilt, AEW held its ground as No. 8 for the night in the Cable Top 150 in the 18-49 demographic. Compared to NXT, Dynamite won every demographic with the exception of 50 and over.</p>
      <p>After the month of October delivered <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/10/14/wwe-friday-night-smackdowns-1-million-viewer-drop-suggests-there-will-be-no-wrestling-boom-period/">sobering statistics about viewership patterns</a> for the Wednesday Night Wars—which are now light years away from transcending pro wrestling to a mainstream audience the way the Monday Night Wars once did—November has been a month full of desperation, particularly in WWE.</p>

      <p>With no head-to-head victories headed into its Survivor Series go-home show, the worldwide leader gleefully exploited the Raw vs. SmackDown vs. NXT dynamic of its Big Four pay-per-view with an all-hands-on-deck, hotshot broadcast. WWE’s lack of advertising main roster stars for the November 6 broadcast led to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/11/07/wwe-nxt-surges-to-within-9000-viewers-of-aew-dynamite-after-raw-invasion/#20e0a8ab6d01">paper-thin loss</a> as AEW topped NXT by just 9,000 viewers.</p>
      <p>WWE learned its lesson this time around as Raw went off the air with Triple H <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/11/18/wwe-raw-results-news-and-notes-after-triple-h-dares-main-roster-stars-to-come-to-nxt/#7e2f54832442">challenging all main roster stars to appear on NXT.</a></p>
      <p>Seth Rollins, Becky Lynch, Drew McIntyre, Ricochet, Cesaro, The Revival, Nikki Cross, Carmella and Kairi Sane were just some of the main roster names with a strong presence on NXT as wild, interpromotional brawls and matchups dominated the show.</p>
      <p>WWE’s apparent sledgehammer-to-ants mentality extended to WWE Backstage on FS1. Backstage’s <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/wwe-backstage-premiere-draws-less-than-50-661832/">disastrous premiere</a> only drew a shockingly low 49,000 viewers. The very next week (on a broadcast which drew 100,000 viewers), CM Punk even more shockingly showed up on the fledgling studio show. Punk’s first advertised appearance <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/wwe-backstage-draws-180-662462/">translated to 180,000 viewers</a>, a sizable 80% bump.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth noting that AEW, which <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/aew-full-gear-estimated-ppv-buys-662219/">drew a flat number of around 100,000 buys</a> for its most recent Full Gear pay-per-view despite having weeks of national television to promote it, also reportedly made a big-money offer to Punk according to Bryan Alvarez of Wrestling Observer Live (h/t <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/cm-punk-reportedly-turned-down-a-lot-of-money-from-aew-662154/">Wrestling Inc</a>). Should AEW continue to struggle on pay-per-view, and/or in the ratings, expect more WWE-like acts of desperation.</p>
      <p>Whether WWE was to succeed or fail in the latest battle of the Wednesday Night Wars, all signs point to the always inevitable occurrence of Vince McMahon’s influence creeping into the product. A head-to-head win over AEW Dynamite would likely incentivize WWE NXT to continue its open-door policy as a means to use marquee names to better combat the rival promotion. Another ratings loss despite having main roster stars all over the show very well could have been an embarrassment; one warranting a complete overhaul of the product as desperation would turn to a possible week-to-week meltdown at Full Sail University.</p>
      <p>In this instance, WWE’s<b> </b>victory is a bittersweet one as this hotshot formula is far from sustainable.</p>
