      <p>Want to be an entrepreneur or are you already one? The data below shows just how increasingly popular the career move is becoming. Whether you crave freedom, creating your own way of delivering outcomes or filling in a gap in the market, the entrepreneurial road can be rewarding, and yet, stressful at the same time. It's a bit like parenting, and when you have the two combined, a lack of self-care and stress can really creep up on you if you're not intentional. I found <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/entrepreneur-statistics/">these statistics</a> on our economy, entrepreneurial trends and perhaps the future of work noteworthy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are 582 million entrepreneurs in the world.</li>
        <li> 22.5% of small businesses fail within the first year.</li>
        <li>62% of US billionaires are self-made - Wealth-X.</li>
        <li>62% of adults believe entrepreneurship is a good career –Babson.</li>
        <li>11.9 million small businesses in the US are owned by women – American Express.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Just as entrepreneurship is growing, our relationship with burnout is also becoming more prevalent. Long work hours, passion, uncertainty and a lack of support and community can all contribute to the cycle of stress and, eventually, burnout. As you know, I'm committed to doing all I can to help career-driven individuals like you make wellness intertwined with your career success.</p>
      <p>I caught up with NY Times best-selling author and Girlboss CEO, Sophia Amoruso. She candidly shared her thoughts on our relationship with work and wellness. </p>
      <p>"It's not about fashion. Wellness is the new luxury."</p>
      <p>"Our tolerance for the grind has changed."</p>
      <p>To dig deeper into how Sophia makes these statements practical in her life and how you can beat burnout as an entrepreneur, I sat down with her to talk about what she does to stay calm and focused while building an empire. </p>
      <p><b>Rachel Montanez: </b>What part does community play in burnout? </p>
      <p><b>Sophia Amoruso: </b>Community is the mesh that catches us when we fall. It's the grass instead of the concrete. We aim to create a community at Girlboss, and we're doing that through our new professional development platform. We realized that everyone was embracing the identity of what it means to be a Girlboss, and the hashtag has been used around 17 million times on social media. So, our new professional network for women allows you to go deeper with how you'd like to be viewed. You can create a portfolio of your life experiences, and that helps make it a rich, professional environment – our personal lives aren't separate from our careers and business ventures. We want the Girlboss community to be one that picks people up when they're feeling down in their careers.</p>
      <p><b>Montanez: </b>How does your daily routine help you avoid burnout?</p>
      <p><b>Amoruso: </b>I make sure I make time for creativity and have learned how to say, "no gracefully." Also, simple things like taking care of myself by getting enough water and knowing my limits. Being aware of your limits is powerful, and sometimes, the only way to know them is to reach them. Calendar reminders are great too. Sometimes, it helps to put self-care reminders on the calendar. Tea is a big part of my routine, also. Taking time out to be in the moment and drinking something like Japanese Green Tea.  </p>
      <p><b>Montanez: </b>Any other advice you’d like to share with entrepreneurs wanting to avoid burnout?</p>
      <p><b>Amoruso: </b>In addition to gaining support and finding a community, it's really crucial to be mentally well-nourished and kind to yourself. You may also have a 2nd album. What I mean by that is that it can take time to make it "big." Make time to stop, reflect and count your wins. </p>
      <p>In thinking about being in the moment and learning through reflection, what can you do today to make sure you don't enter into a battle with burnout? It really can be a battle in that it can take a lot of resources to overcome. It's like I recently said to a business coaching client, your business will only thrive if you are. Your wellness and professional and personal growth are just as important as the service you deliver.  </p>
      <p>If you feel like you already are burnt out, daily routines, intentional self-care and being patient and realistic about how much you can do may help. Getting support through a professional network or business coach can also help you mitigate risks and speed up your learning curve.</p>
