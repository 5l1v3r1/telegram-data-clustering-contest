      <p>Just shy of its 10th year in business, Outclass has set up shop in a spacious new location on Toronto’s Roncesvalles Avenue. This move from a previous storefront in Little Italy has been a long-time dream for partners Matteo Sgaramella, creator and designer, and director of operations Rebecca Sarracini, and offers Outclass a unique position as the sole dedicated men’s wear boutique in the close-knit neighbourhood. “We wanted to keep it really simple, let the clothes shine, make sure it feels really warm and welcoming but also clean and aesthetically pleasing,” Sgaramella says. To that end, the duo tapped the expertise of MSDS, a local design studio, that incorporated a Scandinavian-inspired minimalist palette complete with touches of natural oak and ash wood.</p>

      <p>When creating his clothing designs, Sgaramella turns to his Italian heritage, sticking to a pared-down, timeless aesthetic over chasing the latest fads. “What people are wearing and the way people present themselves in Italy is so different from Canada. I always try and bring a little bit of that back here,” he says. With the exception of their Italian footwear, the entire Outclass line is manufactured within a 20-kilometre radius of the boutique. Fabrics are sourced locally or in Europe. “We’ve definitely noticed a huge shift in the last three years in terms of people being prepared to spend a little bit more on made in Canada,” Sgaramella says. “They like that they can trace where it comes from.”</p>
