      <p><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/07/just-in-court-takes-decision-on-mainas-bail-application/"><u><b>Abdulrasheed Maina</b></u></a> was on Wednesday arraigned before Justice Abubakar Kutigi of the FCT High Court in Gwagwalada over fresh charges of contract racketeering and stealing.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/02/just-in-dss-hands-over-ex-pension-boss-maina-to-efcc/"><u><b>Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)</b></u></a> arraigned Maina on nine counts bordering on alleged N738.6m contract scam.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the embattled former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team was arraigned alongside one Ann Olachi, who was his secretary.</p>
      <p>Maina was alleged to have abused his position as PRTT chairman to award fictitious contracts for purported biometric enrolment of pensioners, an offence punishable under section 317 of the Penal Code Act, Cap532, Vol. 4, Laws of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria 2007.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson for the EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, had said Maina and his cohorts also allegedly made claims for fictitious allowances during the course of the purported biometric enrolment assignment.</p>
      <p>He stated that the proceeds of the fictitious contracts were allegedly remitted into his account through the second defendant.</p>
      <p>The prosecuting counsel M. Abubakar told the court on Wednesday that the matter was slated for arraignment and applied that the charges should be read to the defendants to take their pleas.</p>
      <p>Maina and Olachi pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>The case has been adjourned till November 28, 2019, for ruling on bail application.</p>
