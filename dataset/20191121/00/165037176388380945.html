        <b>Mauricio Pochettino has now become part of Tottenham's past, not future. The club fired the Argentine coach this Tuesday, with José Mourinho taking over, and the move will cost them almost 15 million euros</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tottenham's poor performance has forced the entity to unilaterally terminate Pochettino's contract, but<b> the Argentine will not leave empty-handed.</b> </p>
      <p>The manager, who <b>consistently delivered good results</b> and even took Spurs to a <b>Champions League final</b>, should receive a compensation of around <b>14.6 million euros</b>, as reported by 'The Independent'.</p>

      <p>But that's not all there is to it, because the coaching staff will also be receiving part of that compensation. Therefore, the total amount of the operation will reach <b>23.3 million.</b></p>
      <p>In this way, Levy had no qualms about demonstrating Spurs' economic powers. Meanwhile, <b>José Mourinho</b>, the new coach, will receive 17 million a year, more than <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/new/mourinho-will-earn-almost-double-pochettino-747984">double what Pochettino was receiving.</a></p>
