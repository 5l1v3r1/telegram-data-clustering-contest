        <b>Valuation and Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>We believe CSB Bank (CSB) IPO provides good scope of growth as well as a favourable investment opportunity focused in SME and Gold loan portfolio for investors. CSB has posted turnaround results in 6MFY20 and has improved its operational and financial performance compared to its history performance. We believe the bank should do well with the recent capital raise and its strong risk management frameworks. It has to deliver the best on its core strength supported by the private equity Fairfax, which holds promoter stake. On valuation front, at the upper end of the price band, CSB is demanding a market cap of Rs 3382 Cr and valued at a 2.2x P/BV. Considering turnaround performance and focusing on implementation of strategic changes in business model to function efficiently as a full service new age private sector bank backed by FIHM, the Promoter, we stand positive on the investment rationale and recommend investors to <b>“SUBSCRIBE”</b> to the issue for short term basis as well as for listing gains.</p>
