      <p>Waterloo Brewing Ltd. says it has lost $2.1 million after scammers convinced the company to send money to a fraudulent third-party account.</p>
      <p>The Ontario brewery said Thursday that the “sophisticated” attack in November involved the impersonation of a creditor employee asking for multiple wire transfers.</p>
      <p>After discovering the scheme, the company said it initiated an analysis of all other transaction activity across all of its bank accounts, as well as a review of its internal systems and controls that included its computer networks to prevent further attacks.</p>
      <p>“The company...is working with its auditors and bank to ensure that appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate the chance of any future occurrences of similar cyberattacks,” it said in a news release.</p>
      <p>The brewer said it does not believe that its systems were breached, or that any personal information of its customers is at risk.</p>
      <p>It said it was still actively trying to recover the funds, and has notified relevant authorities, but said there are no assurances any money is forthcoming.</p>
      <p>The brewery is just the latest to fall for online schemes where fraudsters impersonate actual employees to ask for money transfers.</p>
      <p>MacEwan University in Alberta lost $11.8 million in 2017 after fraudsters impersonated a vendor and asked the university to transfer accounts payable to a new bank account.</p>
      <p>This past April, the City of Ottawa treasurer transferred nearly US$100,000 to a fake supplier after scammers posed as the city manager.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre recommends employees know how to verify requests for money before making payments.</p>
