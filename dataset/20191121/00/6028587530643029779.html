      <p>Amidst plenty of skepticism about the liberal arts and majors such as English, it turns out a tiny shift in context can change everything. Want to know how to sell English as a major? Pair it with an industry-recognized credential and voilà – you have a lean, mean marketing machine.In a national survey of 2,000 U.S. adults conducted last week, my team at University Partners and Quest Research asked the following question:</p>
      <p>Imagine you are a hiring manager for a top employer. Which candidate would you hire among the following recent graduates?</p>
      <p>A.     A graduate with a bachelor’s degree in English</p>
      <p>B.     A graduate with a bachelor’s degree in English and an industry-recognized designation in cybersecurity</p>
      <p>C.      A graduate with a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity</p>
      <p>Here’s how the results played out:</p>

      <p>It was a landslide victory for the English major with an industry-recognized credential. U.S. Adults are four times more likely to say they’d hire an English major with a credential over an English major with no credential and they are nearly three times more likely to say they’d hire an English major with a credential over the fast-growing STEM major in cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>What does this simple question and its results tell us? It’s not the English major that’s the problem. It’s an industry-recognized skill attached to the English major that’s the <i>opportunity</i>. I’ve long advocated for a rebranding of the term liberal arts. Americans generally and employers more specifically value the elements of a liberal arts degree such as critical thinking and skilled communication. But the words “liberal” and “arts” get in the way as a poor (and poorly understood) branding term against the backdrop of why we value higher education the most: to get a good job. In fact, <a href="https://www.gallup.com/education/231746/higher-education-drop-term-liberal-arts.aspx">research</a> has shown that parents would chose “no college at all” ahead of a “liberal arts degree” as the best path to a good job for their child.</p>
      <p>Despite all the negativity about liberal arts at the surface level, there continues to be evidence that its underlying value proposition is strong. <i>If </i>it’s combined with an industry-recognized credential. Employers love the blend of general skills such as critical thinking and communication with specific industry-relevant skills. And parents and students are increasingly looking for colleges and universities that provide them with a stronger ROI in the marketplace.</p>
      <p>This combination of a student getting both a bachelor’s degree and an industry-recognized credential is what I call a “credegree.” Credegrees will play a major role in the future of higher education, as I’ve written <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonbusteed/2019/03/11/why-college-will-soon-be-about-credegrees-and-co-ops/#4974ac543159">previously</a>. They represent the perfect mix of what students and employers want with the best of what higher education provides. Long live the English major who can both write and code!           </p>
