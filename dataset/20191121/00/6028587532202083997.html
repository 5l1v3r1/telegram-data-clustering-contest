      <p>The woes of Victoria’s Secret, and the reality of how far it has lost its hip quotient, showed few signs of easing on Wednesday as the largest U.S. lingerie label was the biggest culprit behind parent L Brands’ sharply wider fiscal third-quarter loss.L Brands’ loss was six times wider than a year earlier, growing to $252 million from $42.8 million, thanks to a whopping $285 million pre-tax write-down of some of Victoria’s Secret’s stores and assets in markets including the U.K. and China. Total company sales in the quarter that ended Nov. 2 dropped 3.5%, to $2.68 billion, also hurt by faltering demand at Victoria’s Secret.</p>
      <p>As sister chain Bath &amp; Body Works continued to shine with another better-than- expected 9% increase in comparable sales, Victoria’s Secret’s dropped 7%. Customers visited its stores less, contributing to an 8% comparable-sales drop at the brand’s 1,100-plus stores in the U.S. and Canada. Worse yet, at a time when struggling retailers can often at least boast of an online boost, Victoria’s Secret’s e-commerce sales dropped 6%. </p>
      <p>Once a profit-driving crown jewel for the Columbus, Ohio-based L Brands, the Victoria’s Secret unit swung to an operating loss of $81 million last quarter, from a profit of $14 million a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Demand for Victoria’s Secret’s namesake lingerie label dropped in the “low double digits,” after the company’s decision to cut back on discounts hurt bra sales, L Brands said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, sales of the brand’s Pink line—targeting younger, college-age consumers—fell in the “mid-single digits,” with waning demand for T-shirts and other tops.</p>
      <p>In what appeared to be one bright spot, Pink’s sports bras, bralettes and panties posted “strong growth.” But that gain came only with increased promotions and a bigger assortment of lower-priced entry-level items that are “more accessible” to its core customers. </p>
      <p>“We have more work to do, and we recognize that it will take some time to see improvement in the business,” the retailer said in prepared remarks, adding that its new chiefs for Victoria’s Secret and Pink “are very focused on getting close to our customers and making improvements to our merchandise assortments and marketing.”</p>
      <p>Still, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/08/21/theres-no-sign-victorias-secret-is-getting-its-sexy-back-yet/#149157f07cbc">knowing there’s a problem</a> is one thing; coming up with the right answer to fix it is another, especially against a backdrop of declining traffic to malls that house many of Victoria’s Secret’s stores and with the fashion industry losing a growing portion of consumers’ budgets to tech gadgets as well as restaurants and other experience offerings.</p>
      <p>Victoria’s Secret’s traditionally sexualized image, represented by its “Angels,” has lost favor to a growing array of direct-to-consumer rivals like Third Love touting size-inclusive choices and body-positive messages. A traditional mall rival, American Eagle’s Aerie, has won younger shoppers from the Pink label as well, thanks to its pitch of real-life, untouched images of customers. </p>
      <p>The brand message is just one thing. Products that failed to resonate were what alienated many customers to begin with.</p>

      <p>Victoria’s Secret has fallen to the No. 13 spot among teens’ favorite apparel brands in investment bank Piper Jaffray’s semi-annual <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/10/08/teens-are-shopping-differently-and-that-spells-promise-or-trouble-for-these-brands/#11982ccb27a6">Taking Stock With Teens</a> survey in fall 2019, from No. 5 in spring 2018. American Eagle, on the other hand, claimed the No. 2 spot.</p>
      <p>Although still No. 1, Victoria’s Secret’s share of the growing $13 billion U.S. lingerie market fell to 24% in 2018, from 32% five years earlier, while <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/03/08/american-eagle-urban-necessities/">American Eagle</a>’s Aerie <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2018/07/12/heres-the-real-problem-behind-victorias-secrets-dramatic-fall/">doubled</a> its share during the same period, Euromonitor data has shown. </p>
      <p>L Brands stock closed at $16 Wednesday, a sharp slide from a peak of near $100 in late 2015.</p>
      <p>While Victoria’s Secret is trying—for instance, a recent email campaign from Pink featured a plus-size model who also looked untouched—it remains to be seen whether moves like that can appear authentic to today’s discerning shoppers and help the company eventually win back those lost to other brands. The company also confirmed Thursday it won’t host its annual fashion show extravaganza this year.</p>
      <p>Victoria’s Secret is “not out of the woods,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Kate Fitzsimons said in a report late Wednesday.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2018/11/19/victorias-secret-facing-a-slide-in-sales-and-profit-is-in-need-of-a-new-brand-pitch-fast/#453c5f7c4d70">the time</a> Victoria’s Secret needs to turn itself around may not be on its side.</p>
