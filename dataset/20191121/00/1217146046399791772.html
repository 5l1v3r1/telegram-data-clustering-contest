      <p>The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) warned customers of the threat behind ongoing DoppelPaymer ransomware attacks and reminded them about misleading info on how it spreads.</p>
      <p>"There is misleading information circulating about Microsoft Teams, along with references to RDP (BlueKeep), as ways in which this malware spreads," MSRC Director of Incident Response Simon Pope says.</p>
      <p>"Our security research teams have investigated and found no evidence to support these claims. In our investigations we found that the malware relies on remote human operators using existing Domain Admin credentials to spread across an enterprise network."</p>
      <h3>Ransomware guidance for home and enterprise users</h3>
      <p>Pope mentions good credential hygiene, least privilege, and network segmentation as key measures to take for protecting enterprise networks against ransomware attacks.</p>
      <p>Following these best practices can help security admins block the cybercrime gangs behind DoppelPaymer and other ransomware operations from disabling their security tools, as well as using previously stolen privileged credentials to destroy their data or hold it for ransom.</p>
      <p>"We want to help businesses and governments around the world better protect themselves from these attacks," <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/11/20/customer-guidance-for-the-dopplepaymer-ransomware/">Pope also adds</a>.</p>
      <p>"Protection from Dopplepaymer [sic] and other malware is already available for customers using Windows Defender, and we will continue to enhance these protections as we identify new emerging threats."</p>
      <p>Microsoft lists the following measure customers should take to block ransomware attacks and prevent data loss:</p>
      <p>• Keep your Windows Operating System and antivirus <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/help/updatesoftware.aspx">up-to-date</a>. Upgrade to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade">Windows 10</a>.<br/>• Regularly back-up your files in an external hard-drive.<br/>• Enable file history or system protection. In your Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 devices, you must have your file history enabled and you have to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/17128/windows-8-file-history">setup a drive for file history</a>.<br/>• Use OneDrive for Consumer or for Business.<br/>• Beware of <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office365security/how-to-review-and-mitigate-the-impact-of-phishing-attacks-in-office-365/">phishing emails</a>, spams, and clicking malicious attachment.<br/>• <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/12/16/smartscreen-drive-by-improvements/">Use Microsoft Edge to get SmartScreen protection</a>. It will prevent you from browsing sites that are known to be hosting exploits, and protect you from socially-engineered attacks such as phishing and malware downloads.<br/>• <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2016/02/24/locky-malware-lucky-to-avoid-it/">Disable the loading of macros in your Office programs</a>.<br/>• Disable your Remote Desktop feature whenever possible.<br/>• Use two factor authentication.<br/>• Use a safe and password-protected internet connection.<br/>• Avoid browsing web sites that are known for being malware breeding grounds (illegal download sites, porn sites, etc.).</p>
      <p>While Microsoft recommends disabling Remote Desktop Services if possible, in many cases it is required in enterprise environments.</p>
      <p>If so, admins should make sure not to make Remote Desktop servers accessible from the Internet as they will be targeted by brute-force attacks to gain access to the network behind them. Instead, only make them available after a user logs into a corporate VPN.</p>
      <h3>Large ransoms and BitPaymer connections</h3>
      <p>On November 10th, Mexico's state-owned oil company PEMEX (Petróleos Mexicanos) suffered a DoppelPaymer ransomware attack, with the DoppelPaymer gang asking for a 565 bitcoins ($4.9 million) ransom to decrypt files. </p>
      <p>In a later statement posted on Twitter, Pemex said that they were back operating normally and that their fuel production, supply, and inventory were not affected in the attack.</p>
      <p>DoppelPaymer has been making victims since at least mid-June 2019, and it's asking for hundreds of thousands of US dollars in ransom from its victims.</p>
      <p>The strain has at least eight variants with a continuously upgraded feature set, with the earliest one having been discovered in April.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-doppelpaymer-ransomware-emerges-from-bitpaymers-code/">DoppelPaymer got its name from BitPaymer</a>, with which it shares large portions of code but includes modifications that make it superior like a threaded encryption process for quicker operation.</p>
      <p>"Both BitPaymer and DoppelPaymer continue to be operated in parallel and new victims of both ransomware families have been identified in June and July 2019," CrowdStrike's research and threat intel team says.</p>
      <p>"The parallel operations, coupled with the significant code overlap between BitPaymer and DoppelPaymer, indicate not only a fork of the BitPaymer code base, but an entirely separate operation."</p>
