      <p>MONTREAL (AP) - The only authorized anti-doping laboratory in southeast Asia has been forced to suspend operations, leaving a gap in coverage for much of the region.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/world-anti-doping-agency/">World Anti-Doping Agency</a> has ruled the National Doping Control Centre in Thailand can’t test samples for up to six months because of “non-conformities” found during inspections.</p>
      <p>WADA’s statement late Wednesday didn’t specify the lab’s exact shortcomings.</p>
      <p>“Relevant samples must be securely transported to another WADA-accredited laboratory for analysis,” WADA said.</p>
      <p>“This is in order to ensure continued high-quality sample analysis, which also helps preserve athletes’ confidence in this process and the wider anti-doping system.”</p>

      <p>That leaves the nearest authorized lab in Beijing, nearly 3,300 kilometers (2,050 miles) away.</p>
      <p>A WADA crackdown on substandard testing led to the suspension of the lab in India in August and the complete shutdown of a facility in Kazakhstan in 2017.</p>
      <p>That leaves Asia with only five laboratories and large distances between them. They are in Turkey and Qatar in the west, and Japan, China and South Korea in the east.</p>
      <p>Shipping substances long distances generally means higher costs for national anti-doping agencies. Many southeast Asian countries’ agencies already struggle for funding and conduct a fraction of the tests done by European countries.</p>

        <p>The Bangkok lab tested 3,429 samples in 2017, the last year for which statistics are available, ranking it among the world’s smaller facilities.</p>
