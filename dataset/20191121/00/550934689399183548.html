      <h4>Violence against officials has become an increasing problem in German football. Recently, referees in Berlin and Cologne have gone on strike in protest against attacks on those trying to implement the laws of the game.</h4>
      <p>An amateur footballer in Germany was banned for three years on Thursday after he punched a referee in a regional league match last month.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred in a match between two 11th-tier sides, FSV Münster and TV Semd, and the game was abandoned in the 85th minute as a result.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 22-year-old referee was knocked unconscious by the punch and airlifted via helicopter to a nearby hospital, according to local reports at the time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No place in football</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thursday's ruling, which also includes a six-month suspension for FSV Münster and a €500 ($553) fine for the club, was the right decision according to Theodor Greiner of the Hessian Football Association (HFV).</p>
      <p>"Something like that does not belong on a sports pitch and the three-years are fully justified, it was the highest possible penalty," he told news agency SID.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-football-referees-strike-over-player-violence/a-51287190">Cologne referees went on strike</a>, protesting against growing player violence at local-level matches. The officials cited spitting and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/italy-footballer-mario-balotelli-threatens-to-quit-match-after-racist-chants/a-51099367">racist abuse</a>, as well as physical attacks.</p>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>Horizontal stripes<br/></b>Aren't horizontal stripes supposed to make you look fat? Then again, that's not a problem for members of the Geman national team. Assuming they are fit next summer (and are selected by coach Joachim Löw), this is what Timo Werner, Serge Gnabry and Nico Schulz will be wearing at Euro 2020. And no, they aren't all wearing captain's armbands on both arms!</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>Distinct lack of color<br/></b>This one won't go down as one of the favorites, but that has nothing to do with the aesthetics of the garment. This was the kit Germany wore in their disastrous bid to defend their World Cup in Russia in 2018. Toni Kroos, Mesut Özil and Mats Hummels were part of a team that disappointed an entire nation. It would also turn out to be Özil's last tournament before he ended his national team career.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>World Cup winner<br/></b>The 2014 jersey was inspired by the jersey that Germany wore in in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Apparently the three shades of red are meant to represent the black red and gold of the German flag. Instead of the traditional black shorts Germany went with white. Mario Götze will be forever held dearly in German fans' hearts for his winning goal in extra time of the final against Argentina.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>Men in Black<br/></b>Prior to World War II, Germany played in black, and the color was brought back for the alternate jersey at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Germany finished third in South Africa, partly thanks to a Sami Khedira (right) goal against Uruguay in the match for third place. Per Mertesacker also looks pumped. Wait a minute… aren't players meant to hate playing in third-place consolation games?</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>Summer fairy tale<br/></b>The 2006 World Cup in Germany is remembered in the host nation as the "summer fairy tale." With Michael Ballack in midfield, Germany played more attractive football than they had in years. Italy proved to be Germany's nemesis though, knocking them out with two goals late in extra time of their semifinal. As for the jersey, just a splash of gold and red broke up the white - plus the black trim.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>France 1998<br/></b>While keeping the traditional mainly white home kit, the jersey Jürgen Klinsmann and Co. wore next door in France in 1998 featured the horizontal black, red and gold stripes of Germany's flag across the chest. Another new element was the three stars above the eagle for Germany's three World Cup titles. It didn't end well for Germany though, as they fell to Croatia in the quarterfinals.</figcaption>

The jersey Germany wore when "football came home" to England differed from its predecessors because it featured a white eagle on a black crest.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>Upside down in the United States<br/></b>Lothar Matthäus and coach Berti Vogts didn't really have a good time in the United States in 1994. The tournament, which saw Steffen Effenberg sent home early, was largely one to forget, with Germany losing to Bulgaria in the quarterfinals.. As for the jersey, one can only wonder who decided it was a good idea to turn the colors of the German flag upside down…</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>Italia 1990<br/></b>West Germany started wearing this jersey in the 1988 European championship, which the still divided country hosted. Two years later, West and East Germany were just months from becoming one country, and players from both sides featured in the national team that won the 1990 World Cup in Italy.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>Green<br/></b>West Germany and Germany have often worn green as their alternate kit. Captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and his teammates made it to the final against Argentina in Mexico City's Azteka Stadium in 1986. Rummenigge scored, but his side were second-best to an Argentine team led by a Diego Maradona at the height of his powers. Argentina won 3-2 to hoist the World Cup for a second time.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Eagle on the chest: Germany football kits over the years<br/><b>1974 World Cup <br/></b>In the 1970s West Germany jerseys were an all-but all-white affair. One notable feature of the jersey worn here by Gerd Müller and Wolfgang Overrath was an eagle that is somewhat bigger than the one on more recent kits. This classic jersey is remembered fondly for the fact that Müller and the rest of the Nationalmannschaft earned the right to lift the World Cup in 1974 in Munich.</figcaption>

West Germany upset the magic Magyars led by the legendary Ferenc Puskas in the World Cup final 3-2. The match was played on a waterlogged pitch in the Swiss capital. This World Cup title, West Germany's first, would be dubbed "the miracle of Bern."<br/>Author: Chuck Penfold</figcaption>
