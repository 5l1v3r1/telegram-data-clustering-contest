      <p>Members of the Jockeys Association of India (JAI) are satisfied at last. The owners are pleased and the racing buffs are delighted that the thunder of the hooves <br/>will provide a lyrical ring rather than the ominous tone on Friday. <br/><br/>The jockeys who had declared that they would not risk riding on the treacherous track at the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC), were satisfied after testing the track in two mock races on Wednesday. They agreed to accept rides in the competitive 10-event card framed for Friday. <br/><br/>Last Friday, punters went on a rampage after three jockeys sustained injuries in the opening event on the first day of the winter season and one horse, Will To Win, was euthanised. They broke furniture and television sets. <br/><br/>The next day, stewards of the BTC decided to rectify some of the portions of the treacherous track after the jockeys made it clear that they would not ride on it until it was fixed. <br/><br/>JAI president Pradeep Chouhan said that the track now appears to be firm after the club worked hard to fill and bind a few loose portions of it after the unfortunate incident on the first day. <br/><br/>BTC chairman Vinod Sivappa said that he is delighted and announced that racing will resume. <br/><br/><br/>“Now that all the things have been sorted out, winter racing will provide a perfect platform for the best horses to catapult to fame,” he said. <br/><br/>He pointed out that the conditions are on par with the other premier racing centres. <br/><br/><br/>When asked if the BTC committee has met Additional Chief Secretary (Finance) ISN Prasad after H K Patil, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), disclosed that the club owes 32.8 crore arrears and directed that all racing activities be suspended from December 2, Vinod said, “ We will meet him on Saturday and seek his advice on the issue.</p>
