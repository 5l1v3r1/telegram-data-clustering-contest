      <h1>This App Takes a Picture of You From a Satellite</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>“Spelfie”</h3>
      <p>If you’ve ever wondered what you look like from orbit, a new app called Spelfie may be able to help.</p>
      <p>The premise is simple, <a href="https://www.space.com/space-selfies-app-spelfie.html">according to <i>Space.com</i></a>: go to a big event — there aren’t enough satellites to go around otherwise — and sign in, and an Airbus satellite will snap a picture of your coordinates from space. You won’t be able to <a href="https://futurism.com/earthi-vividx2-satellite-high-resolution">spot yourself</a>, but it is a neat way to interact with ongoing space programs.</p>
      <h3>Big Goals</h3>
      <p>Spelfie was first used to highlight the growing pollution problem in Bali by capturing images of activists in the area, according to <i>Space.com</i>. The first image taken through the app showed activists standing in formation on a beach to spell “Act Now,” the name of a United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/take-action.shtml">climate action campaign</a>.</p>
      <p>CEO Chris Newlands gave a statement to <i>Space.com,</i> saying “Spelfie is a movement of people who want to change the world and make a difference through social media and imagery.”</p>
