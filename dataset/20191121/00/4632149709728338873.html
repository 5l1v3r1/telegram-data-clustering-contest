      <p><i>Rain over next two days may cause dip in temperature</i> <br/><br/>Bengalureans, it’s time to take your warm clothes out of the closet. Weathermen say temperatures in the city may dip further due to rain over the next two days. The meteorological department predicts rains until November 22 due to a cyclonic circulation. <br/><br/>Sundar Maitri, director, Indian Meteorological Department, says that one can expect light to moderate showers with thunderstorm in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka such as Tumakuru, Kolar and Mysuru. SSM Gavaskar, scientist, Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), says it was predicted a couple of days ago that the city, Malnad and southern Karnataka can expect good amount of rains until November 22. <br/><br/>“The northeast wind has become active. As it is harvest season, rain is not good news for the agrarian community. The harvest can be affected and it can lead to crop loss too. Usually, rain subsides by November but the clear skies over the last few days caused heat exchange in the atmosphere and the movement of moisture due to Northeastern winds has led to the formation of clouds. In the isolated Western Ghats regions, heavy rains is predicted,” he says. <br/><br/><b>Take good care</b> <br/><br/>The sudden change in the weather can lead to viral infections and respiratory issues. Doctors advise to stay warm and avoid public places without any protection as the infections spread through the air. Dr Mahesh Kumar, Consultant, Internal Medicine, Narayana Health City, says, the cyclone Bulbul has created depression in Indian Ocean leading to dip in temperature.</p>

      <p>–SSM Gavaskar, KSNDMC<br/><br/>“This has caused many complaints of respiratory infections, dengue like viral infection with high grade fever and severe body pain which refuses to settle even in four days. The experts say that influenza A is also on the rise. “I see 10 to 15 patients with high grade fever every day,” he says. Dr Jyothsna Krishnappa, Senior Consultant - Internal Medicine, Apollo Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road, adds patients with underlying medical conditions such as asthma and cardiac issues are more prone to these infections. “They should consume adequate water and keep themselves warm. One should stay indoors if they are already unwell and seek medical care in case fever persists for more than a day to avoid any complications,” she says. She adds though flu shots are recommended during the months of June and July but in some cases now, we do suggest shots even now.</p>
