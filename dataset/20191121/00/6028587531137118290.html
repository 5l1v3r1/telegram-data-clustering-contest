      <p>I love skiing and have been writing on alpine ski travel for over 20 years. But I also love cross country, and I think it gets overlooked when it comes time for winter vacation planning. The advantages are many: even more interaction with beautiful nature, more exercise, more time off the snow, more flexibility over your day and schedule, much less specialized gear required, no crowds or lines, no $200 lift tickets and no overpriced and mediocre cafeteria style lunches. From a travel perspective, you can consider an entirely different set of resorts and destinations. I would argue that some of the top places you can go for a cross country vacation are better than the finest ski-in/ski-out slopeside luxury hotels in the country. You can also easily combine the two and do a downhill ski vacation with some time for cross country, or vice versa.</p>
      <p>But perhaps most of all, you can enjoy a Nordic ski vacation even if you do not know how to ski! You can learn the basics and hit the trail in under an hour.</p>

      <p>Cross-country is a Nordic discipline (along with ski jumping and telemark skiing), while alpine disciplines include downhill skiing and snowboarding. It comes in two main forms, but classic, which involves sliding one leg at a time in two parallel groomed slot-like tracks, with the skis never losing contact with the snow, is by far the most popular. This can literally be learned in minutes and mastered in a day, yet it never ceases to entertain or challenge, with trails marked green, blue and black (easy, intermediate, difficult) just like downhill. Skating is the high-output fitness version, where skiers push themselves with a V-shaped stride like ice skating, lifting one foot off the snow at a time, usually at a faster pace and on a wider groomed path with no tracks. One thing they have in common is very comfortable lightweight boots, a big bonus for downhill skiers who complain about sore feet.</p>
      <p>Classic is more popular and pretty much any place that offers cross country trails has them groomed for this, while skating is typically found only at more dedicated or serious Nordic facilities. It is more of a fitness pursuit, and if you want to try it, you should definitely take lessons. In either case, for the most part you can make due with the same kind of clothing you would wear for winter running, fat tire biking, or any cold weather highly aerobic pursuits, and you don’t need the more waterproof gear and extras like goggles associated with downhill.</p>

      <p>In many cases you can enjoy a leisurely breakfast by a roaring fire, then head out for an hour or two or three, come back, have lunch, have a massage, hit the hot tub, and go back out in the afternoon. Or you can combine sessions of Nordic skiing with snowshoeing, fat biking or myriad other activities. Sometimes you can take guided naturalist ski tours through National Parks or Forests, and maybe even go out at night under the light of the full moon or a headlamp. It lends itself to a more customized, well rounded, and often quintessentially romantic style of winter vacation.</p>
      <p>There are several kinds of options for where to go. There are Nordic focused destination resorts; dude ranch type properties with extensive trail systems, which tend to be off season and thus good values in the winter; hut-to-hut networks for more of a wilderness adventure trip; and Nordic areas at established downhill skiing resorts in ski towns. Here are some of the best of each type.</p>

      <p><b>Cross Country Skiing Resorts:</b> <a href="https://www.devilsthumbranch.com/">Devil’s Thumb Ranch Resort &amp; Spa</a> in Colorado is often rated the top Nordic ski resort in the country, and for good reason: it has a staggering system with over 70-miles of trails, offers both skating and classic as well as trails for fat tire winter mountain biking, and has a fully-equipped cross-country ski shop offering lessons for all abilities. While it has a variety of upscale lodging and dining options and a large spa, it is not all-inclusive like most dude ranches, and is quite comfortable but certainly not a top tier luxury property. The main selling point is amazing skiing, plus easy access, just an hour and a half from Denver.</p>
      <p>On the East coast, the <a href="https://www.trappfamily.com/">Von Trapp Family Lodge</a> in Stowe, Vermont was the nation’s very first Nordic center, and the first to install snowmaking. It offers a full-blown cross-country vacation resort experience with Austrian flavor in the heart of the best and most vibrant Eastern ski town - you can even ski to the resort’s brewpub for lunch.</p>

      <p>In New Hampshire’s Mt. Washington Valley, the heart of the White mountains, one notable new option is the 68-room <a href="https://theglenhouse.com/">Glen House</a>, which was just named the state’s Best New Hotel of 2019 by Yankee Magazine. Adjacent to the hotel is the Great Glens Trails Outdoor Center with nearly 30-miles of groomed classic and skate trails, plus fat biking, with full rental shop and ski school.</p>
      <p>Two true top tier luxury boutique resorts with extensive on-site private cross country ski offerings are the Forbes 5-Star <a href="https://www.twinfarms.com/">Twin Farms</a> in Vermont, one of the nation’s finest resorts period (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2011/05/21/hotels-i-love-twin-farms-vt/#2a19282666ab">read more here about why</a>), and another personal favorite of mine, <a href="https://www.duntondestinations.com/hot-springs/">Dunton Hot Springs</a>, outside Telluride, Colorado (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2013/12/20/hotels-of-the-year-2013/#566a1d653876">read more here</a>) a historic ghost town turned one-of-a-kind luxury resort. Both are deluxe all-inclusives with amazing food, lodging and pampering.</p>

        <figcaption>You'll hardly be roughing it at top XC ski vacation spots like the Forbes 5-Star Ranch at Rock ... [+] Creek, MT.<cite>Ranch at Rock Creek</cite></figcaption>

      <p><b>Dude Ranches:</b> The best dude ranches in the country are among the most luxurious resorts as well, and many of the most acclaimed such properties feature cross-country as a main winter activity, with large groomed trail networks. But on top of this they typically offer a wide slate of other things to do, from dog sledding to horseback riding, plus great food and lodging. They also tend to be very family friendly and all-inclusive. Top choices include the Forbes 5-Star (and Relais &amp; Chateaux) <a href="https://www.theranchatrockcreek.com/">Ranch at Rock Creek</a>, Forbes 4-Star <a href="https://www.triplecreekranch.com/">Triple Creek Ranch</a> (also Relais &amp; Chateaux), the Forbes 4-Star <a href="https://www.pawsup.com/">Resort at Paws Up</a>, and <a href="https://lonemountainranch.com/">Lone Mountain Ranch</a>, which sits very close to the world-class Big Sky downhill, has more than 50 mile of trails and was rated the nation’s best Nordic resort by <i>Cross Country Skier</i> magazine. All four are in Montana.</p>

      <p><b>Hut to Hut:</b> Most of these systems are designed for more experienced skiers, and in many cases with heavier duty alpine touring (AT) gear. One delightful user-friendly exception that is welcoming even to novices is the <a href="https://mainehuts.org/">Maine Hut &amp; Trails </a>system, which was designed with all sorts of users in mind, not just the savviest adventurers. It is perfect for average cross-country skiers using classic gear and even those on snowshoes, which requires little more expertise than knowing how to walk. Because they offer an option to have your luggage gear transported by snowmobile, you don’t have to carry a pack, and the system is well mapped and easy to navigate, though private guides are available.</p>
      <p>The Maine Huts &amp; Trails system includes four fairly luxurious “huts” connected by 80 miles of trails, with eight more huts planned for the future. These are basically large log and stone cabins with cozy leather furniture, heat, power, hot water and showers. Accommodations are a mix of private and communal bunk rooms, with common areas featuring big stone fireplaces and stocked with board games and lending libraries. Each hut has a full commercial kitchen and live-in staff, who serve tasty dinners and breakfasts to overnight guests. The non-profit trail organization has partnered with local farms and purveyors and focuses on sustainably raised meats, fresh veggies and grains, and they offer craft beer and wine.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Ski Towns:</b> For those who want to try cross-country without giving up downhill, or for people who do not alpine ski but still want to experience what the classic ski town vacation is all about, most major ski resorts have Nordic trail systems. A top choice is Whistler/Blackcomb, British Columbia, which has both the largest and most popular ski resort in North America and a comprehensive modern Nordic center purpose built for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. You can take an array of lessons, skate or classic, and even try your hand at the rare shooting and skiing discipline of biathlon here, while enjoying all the trappings of the famous village and luxury lodging choices like the Four Seasons and Fairmont.</p>
      <p>Other standout places for combining world class cross-country and downhill skiing with luxury lodging and the full ski vacation experience are Beaver Creek, Colorado; Sun Valley, Idaho and Tahoe’s Kirkwood in California.</p>
