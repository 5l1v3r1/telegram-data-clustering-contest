      <p>Premier Doug Ford says his government is still working toward its commitment to an open cannabis retail system, and more stores will be opening in the new year.</p>
      <p>The Progressive Conservative government had initially said there would be no cap on the number of retail pot shops after cannabis was legalized.</p>
      <p>But a supply shortage prompted the Tories to move to a lottery system, capping the initial number of pot retail licences to just 25, and later holding a second lottery for 42 more.</p>
      <p>BNN Bloomberg reports today that the government is looking to scrap the lottery system and move toward an open allocation system as early as January.</p>
      <p>Ford says he believes in letting the market dictate how many stores can be supported, now that there is enough supply.</p>
      <p>He says the ultimate goal is to get rid of the black market.</p>
