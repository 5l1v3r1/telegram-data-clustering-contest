      <p>On Amazon’s jobs site, a keyword search query for Amazon Go yielded 3,500 results, seeking to fill positions manning the cashierless stores and looking for a head of marketing for the concept and a wide variety of engineers and program managers.Meanwhile, six months after the first Amazon Go <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/06/26/amazon-gos-even-bigger-rollout-is-not-a-matter-of-if-but-when/">opened in New York</a> in May, six stores are in operation in the city, including four located less than a mile from one another in Midtown Manhattan. Two more are scheduled to open soon in the city.</p>

      <p>Those job postings and the fact that Amazon Go is cropping up in busy commercial sections of New York are just the latest signal of the Seattle giant’s ambition to further expand its Just Walk Out Shopping concept, which features in-house-built computer vision, sensor fusion and deep machine learning technologies similar to those used in self-driving cars. They allow customers to just grab what they need and walk out without scanning products or waiting in line to check out items. </p>
      <p>Amazon Go has 21 convenience stores—located in San Francisco, Chicago and its Seattle home market, in addition to New York—less than two years after it opened to the public its first location. Some of the stores serve hot coffee and espresso.</p>

      <p>With the concept a hit, Amazon is aiming high. Bloomberg, which previously reported Amazon was targeting 3,000 Amazon Go convenience stores by 2021, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/01/20/six-key-retail-tech-trends-to-watch-for-2019-and-its-not-just-about-amazon/#323adcae66fc">reported Wednesday</a> that the tech and retail giant plans to open a much larger Amazon Go supermarket next year in Seattle, as well as pop-up shops. It also reported the company is in talks with other companies to license its technology. </p>
      <p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. </p>
      <p>Those reported moves make sense. For one, the computer vision technology that helps power Amazon Go cashierless stores is already available to Amazon’s AWS cloud service customers, including many rival retailers.</p>

      <p>Licensing to other merchants would help Amazon cover the cost behind the concept. The hardware for each Amazon Go convenience store costs about $1 million on average, and it would take about two years for Amazon to break even, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/01/13/why-amazon-go-may-soon-change-the-way-we-want-to-shop/#2af7dbb26709">has estimated</a>. </p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, just as Amazon has now made two-day shipping (and now even one-day delivery) the new industry norm, retailers and other venues are eager to create their own version of an Amazon Go experience to satisfy consumer demand.</p>
      <p>In global consultancy A.T. Kearney’s 2019 Consumer Retail Technology Survey,<i> </i>72% of the consumers surveyed ranked technology that allows them to reduce time spent checking out among their most coveted in-store <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/01/20/six-key-retail-tech-trends-to-watch-for-2019-and-its-not-just-about-amazon/#323adcae66fc">retail technologies</a>, far above other tech bells and whistles and more than double the 31% who said they desired a feature that allows them to customize products. </p>
      <p>Many young startups with their own cashierless technologies are eager to arm Amazon’s rivals and other merchants with checkout-free bragging rights. </p>
      <p>For instance, Tesco, the U.K.’s largest grocer, in October made an equity investment in Israeli startup Trigo. It’s testing Trigo’s technology inside a 3,000-square-foot store located at Tesco's headquarters that will soon begin testing with Tesco employees, Trigo said, adding that it’s also working with Israel’s largest grocery chain and is talking to other U.S. and European grocers. </p>
      <p>French retail giant Carrefour SA is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spurred-by-amazon-supermarkets-try-swapping-cashiers-for-cameras-11562491800">reportedly</a> running tests with French startup Qopius Technology. Back in the U.S., several venture-capital-backed startups born out of the Bay Area have unveiled their own checkout-free technology. Three-year-old Grabango, headquartered in Berkeley, is testing its cashierless technology at supermarket chain Giant Eagle’s Pittsburgh store “in passive mode” before going live with Giant Eagle customers. Two other unannounced stores are testing its concept in Northern California.</p>
      <p>For sports fans, the Worcester Red Sox recently inked a deal to have startup Standard Cognition build an “autonomous checkout store” in the Polar Park pro sports and entertainment venue that is under construction and is scheduled to open in April 2021. </p>
      <p>Golden 1 Center has worked with startup Zippin and opened an in-arena checkout-free convenience store about a month ago for Sacramento Kings home games and concerts at the arena. In August, Zippin signed “a strategic partnership” with Brazil’s largest retailer to deploy its checkout-free technology in stores in that country.</p>
      <p>“We got traction after Amazon Go,” Krishna Motukuri, CEO and cofounder of Zippin—and a former Amazon employee—told me <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/01/20/six-key-retail-tech-trends-to-watch-for-2019-and-its-not-just-about-amazon/">in an interview</a> this year. Retailers started to take its cashierless technology more seriously after Amazon Go opened to the public, he said. He said on Thursday that the store at the arena is “doing really well.”</p>
      <p>The elephant in the retail industry continues to make a disruptive, and game-changing, impact.</p>
