      <p>HOWELL, Mich. (AP) - A factory in Livingston County has been ordered to stop emitting a chemical linked to cancer.</p>
      <p>The county health department says tests revealed high levels of trichloroethylene, or TCE, in the air near Diamond Chrome Plating in Howell. The levels are high enough to be considered a health hazard.</p>
      <p>Diamond Chrome has complied with an order to stop the emissions. A public meeting is planned Thursday at 7 p.m. at Parker Middle School.</p>
      <p>The health department says elevated levels of TCE can cause birth defects and raise the risk of kidney cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>

        <p>Diamond Chrome uses TCE to remove grease from metal parts. Consultant Jim Colmer tells the Daily Press &amp; Argus that the company is taking steps to correct any issues.</p>
