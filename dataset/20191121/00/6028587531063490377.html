      <p>The crowds aren’t as summer-rush huge, which means you can probably get a seat at the park’s most famous watering hole after a day on the trail.</p>

        <figcaption>YOSEMITE VALLEY, CA - OCTOBER 7: A layer of stratocumulus clouds float across the Valley and the ... [+] Sierra Nevada Mountain Range on October 7, 2019, in Yosemite National Park, California. With the arrival of fall, the tens of thousands of monthly visitors begins to drop off but the usual weekend traffic congestion and on-going road construction projects continue to provide challenges for getting around in the Park.

      <h3>John Muir is calling...</h3>
      <p>The famous naturalist – one of the driving forces behind this remarkable space being named a national park – is still a steady presence at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">Yosemite</a>. His famous quote, “The mountains are calling and I must go,” is emblazoned on all sorts of merch.</p>
      <p>He would likely be aghast at the long lines of cars snaking through Yosemite Valley during the busy season. But when the weather turns chill, the number of visitors drops off. You might have trouble believing that if you get stuck in the conga lines that form on the popular trails to Bridalveil Fall and Cook’s Meadow Loop.</p>
      <p>Take solace in finding openings at the daily photo workshops given by the <a href="http://anseladams.com/ansel-adams-gallery-in-yosemite/">Ansel Adams Gallery</a>, or that you won’t have to wait long for a table in the recently renovated lounge at The Ahwahnee, the iconic hotel that’s been around since 1927.</p>

      <h3>Steeped in history</h3>
      <p>The park’s famous hotel – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suziedundas/2019/07/16/the-majestic-yosemite-hotel-finally-gets-restored-to-its-former-name-the-ahwahnee-is-back/#777d0b9d2e40">recently returned to its original name following a three-year legal dispute</a> – is often packed with visitors, many drawn to the beautiful bar.</p>
      <p>When the Ahwahnee first opened, that space actually served as an entrance. There was no bar because the nation was in the middle of Prohibition. That bit of trivia makes the craft cocktail menu make a lot of sense, as it’s filled with classic creations that are freshened up with modern twists.</p>
      <p>Take the signature Ahwahnee Manhattan, for instance. That old-school favorite was given an update by head bartender Steve Randle, who swapped Woodford Reserve Bourbon for the traditional rye. The hint of fragrant sweet vermouth quality comes from Carpano Antica, considered the best in its class. <a href="https://www.feebrothers.com/products/bitters/black_walnut_bitters.php">Fee Brothers black walnut bitters</a> give the up drink a California kick.</p>
      <p>Other retro-cool cocktails include a Mai Tai, the Whiskey Side Car and that boozy blast from New Orleans, the Corpse Reviver.</p>
      <p>Judging from the snacks headed to guests during a recent happy hour, the over-sized pretzel seems just about the right choice for a pre-dinner snack.</p>

      <h3>Reservations recommended</h3>
      <p>Unlike the more casual bar, reservations are recommended in the dining room because the hotel is home to a long list of special events during the fall and winter seasons.</p>
      <p>Like the bar, its menu nods to the past but with modern updates. We’re looking at you, duck confit lumpia, California lamb osso bucco and vegan-friendly falafel cake. Beware looking too closely at the dessert menu, which like the savory dishes, lists calorie counts. Maybe if you share the 1,500 calorie chocolate hazelnut layer cake...</p>
