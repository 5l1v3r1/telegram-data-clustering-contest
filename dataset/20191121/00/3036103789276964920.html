      <h1>Gmail integration for Outlook in testing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft is testing a new feature that will allow users to add Google Services to their Outlook accounts, reports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973889/microsoft-outlook-web-gmail-google-drive-calendar-integration-support-features"><b>The Verge</b></a>.</p>
      <p>This was first revealed by Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/flobo09/status/1197103010138247170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197103010138247170&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F11%2F20%2F20973889%2Fmicrosoft-outlook-web-gmail-google-drive-calendar-integration-support-features"><b>Florian B</b></a>, who was able to access the feature and take screenshots of it.</p>
      <p>Once a user’s Google account is linked to their Outlook account, they will be able to view their Gmail emails, Google Drive Documents, and Google Calendar entries from their Outlook.com email client interface.</p>
      <p>This feature looks similar to Microsoft Outlook for iOS and Android, as there are separate inboxes and side-by-side calendar integration.</p>
      <p>The feature is far from finished, however. According to Florian B, users who can access the test can only add a single Google Account and any attempt to switch between one’s Outlook and Gmail accounts results in the page refreshing.</p>
      <p>Microsoft confirmed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/20/microsoft-gmail-integration-outlook/"><b>Engadget</b></a> that it is testing the feature on a small group of users.</p>
      <p>“We are always looking for new ways to extend the best email experience to our customers and can confirm that we’re experimenting with a small set of Outlook.com users to learn and gather feedback,” said Microsoft.</p>
