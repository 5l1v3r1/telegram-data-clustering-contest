        <b>Andrea Iannone says his RS-GP caught fire during the MotoGP Valencia test because Aprilia was trying an "extreme" gearbox solution to find more power.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Iannone caused a red flag a couple of hours into Wednesday's running at the Valencia test when his Aprilia burst into flames on the main straight on the run into Turn 1.</p>
      <p>Aprilia had no new items to test in Valencia - which Aleix Espargaro branded as <a href="https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/147253/espargaro-no-new-bike-at-test-unacceptable">"not at all" acceptable</a> - but were trying different set-up solutions to apply to the development of its radical 2020 bike.</p>
      <p>One such solution was to try and run the Aprilia's gearbox with shorter gear ratios like its rivals in a bid to improve its speed.</p>
      <p>However, the Aprilia engine had never revved as high as it did during that test and ultimately led to Iannone's bike catching fire.</p>
      <p>"We're not used to using a high speed like on Wednesday morning," Iannone said.</p>
      <p>"We tried an extreme solution, because we understood that our opponents use much shorter gearboxes and consequently much higher engine revs.</p>

      <p>"Our bike has never been [run] so high. We tried it and there was a risk."</p>
      <p>Commenting on the moment the fire erupted, he added: "I was so scared because it happened on the straight and the bike caught fire.</p>
      <p>"I felt very warm on my feet and oil was [landing] on the brake lever. "You are angry at the time, but I think that's normal.</p>
      <p>"We tried different solutions because we want to find a few more horses [horsepower].</p>
      <p>"We know that we need to improve and last night [Tuesday] we found some very interesting things."</p>
      <p>Iannone called Aprilia racing manager Romano Albesiano "very brave" for suggesting the idea to run shorter gear ratios, though branded the situation as "very dangerous".</p>
      <p>"Romano is a very brave person in this respect, because maybe we shouldn't have risked this situation," he added.</p>
      <p>"But he led us to find something. Let's say it went wrong in one way and good in another.</p>
      <p>"It was a dangerous situation and obviously frightening."</p>
