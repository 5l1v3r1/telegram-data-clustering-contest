      <p>The pay dispute between Melbourne tram workers and Yarra Trams continues, as negotiations on a new workplace agreement remain at an impasse.</p>
      <p>Tram workers walked off the job <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/city-file/article/melbourne-tram-workers-strike">in August</a>, led by the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU). They will do so again the next two Thursdays.</p>
      <p>On November 28, and again on December 5, about 1500 drivers and customer-service personnel will stop working between 10am and 2pm.</p>
      <p>The RTBU is currently seeking a six per cent annual pay rise over three years, while Yarra Trams is offering a four per cent pay rise over four years. Yarra Trams also wants to lift the cap on the number of part-time workers in its workforce.</p>
      <p>Buses will replace trams during the strikes but will run less frequently.</p>
