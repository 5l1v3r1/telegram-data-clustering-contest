        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you believe President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> will release his financials prior to the election, I shall sell you a used car as new or even a government-financed bridge in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york/">New York</a> (“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> promises to release ‘statement’ on his finances before electio” Web, Nov. 21). As is true of most billionaires, the finances of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> present a picture of legal tax evasion, and in his case a history of failed financial efforts. While neither of these should disqualify him for running for or holding office, their disclosure would remove any picture of invincibility.</p>
      <p>The question that should be asked is whether the American electorate will accept a flawed but vocal president with a reasonable agenda or instead favor a possible radical, even socialist democratic candidate. The choice between a Democrat and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> may depend on whether we want a bipartisan leader or a partisan one.</p>
