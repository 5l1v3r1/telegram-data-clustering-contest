      <h1>Glitch in Medicare drug plan finder could cost consumers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">WASHINGTON</a> (AP) — A glitch in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a>’s revamped prescription plan finder can steer unwitting seniors to coverage that costs much more than they need to pay, according to people who help with sign-ups as well as program experts.</p>
      <p>Serving some 60 million <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> recipients, the plan finder is the most commonly used tool on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a>.gov and just got its first major update in a decade. The Trump administration has hailed the new version and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> Administrator Seema Verma says it will empower beneficiaries to take advantage of their coverage options.</p>
      <p>But as open enrollment goes into the home stretch Thanksgiving week, critics say the new tool can create confusion by obscuring out-of-pocket costs that seniors should factor into their decisions.</p>
      <p>“I want to make sure people are given the most accurate information and they’re making the best decision - because they are the ones stuck with it,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ann-kayrish/">Ann Kayrish</a>, senior program manager for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> at the National Council on Aging, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for seniors and provides community services.</p>
      <p>Government programs mixing health care and technology have faced struggles. Despite billions spent to subsidize electronic medical records, getting different systems to communicate remains a challenge. The Obama administration’s launch of HealthCare.gov resulted in an embarrassing debacle when the website froze up the first day.</p>

      <p>The leading Democrat on the Senate Aging Committee said he’s hearing concerns from constituents and organizations that assist <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> beneficiaries. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey said he will ask <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> to grant seniors who’ve had problems a second chance to sign up, called a “special enrollment period.”</p>
      <p>“It’s obviously an effort that needs a lot more work to meet the legitimate expectations of seniors,” said Casey. “Especially when you launch something new, (it) can go awry. People steered in the wrong direction should get a measure of fairness.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> plan finder’s issue stems from a significant change the agency made for 2020.</p>
      <p>The plan with the lowest premium now gets automatically placed on top, with the monthly premium displayed in large font.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a>’s previous plan finder automatically sorted plans by total cost, not just premiums.</p>
        <p>But premiums are only one piece of information.</p>
        <p>When out-of-pocket expenses such as copays are factored in, the plan with the lowest total annual cost is often not the first one shown by the plan finder.</p>
        <p>It takes extra work for a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> enrollee to discover that.</p>
        <p>“If they pick the plan based solely on the premium they are likely getting a plan that could cost them thousands more in a calendar year,” said Christina Reeg of the Ohio Department of Insurance. She heads a program that helps <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> enrollees try to find the right plan.</p>
        <p>In a statement, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> said the monthly premium is a cost that consumers understand and will always be an important decision factor. But the agency also said total cost paid out-of-pocket is at least equally, if not more important, particularly for people who take prescription drugs - as do most seniors.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> said it chose to prominently display premiums because user testing showed that’s what consumers are familiar with. The total annual cost is included, but in smaller font.</p>
        <p>That’s puzzling to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ann-kayrish/">Kayrish</a>. “The default sort right now is by lowest premium but that doesn’t necessarily translate to lowest cost over the year,” she explained.</p>
        <p>Consumers using the plan finder first enter their medications and dosages. To get it to find plans by lowest total annual cost, they must take a few more steps, said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ann-kayrish/">Kayrish</a>.</p>
        <p>After the screen displays initial search results, consumers should look for the drop-down menu on the right of the screen. Next, she said, select the feature that lets you re-sort plans by “lowest drug + premium cost.”</p>
        <p>A reporter’s sample search on a list of six medications for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes returned 29 plans in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-dc/">Washington, D.C.</a>, area, topped by a lowest-premium option for $13.20 a month.</p>
        <p>But after re-sorting for the lowest total cost, the best deal was a plan with a monthly premium of $25.80.</p>
        <p>When out-of-pocket expenses were factored in, the second plan cost about $5,800 less a year than the initial lowest-premium option the plan finder displayed.</p>
        <p>Costs can vary so much because plans have different coverage designs and they don’t pay the same prices to drugmakers.</p>
        <p>And <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ann-kayrish/">Kayrish</a> said there’s another issue: The new plan finder can return options that don’t cover all of a patient’s medications.</p>
        <p>If a low-premium plan has very high out-of-pocket costs, it’s a clue that some of your drugs may not be covered. Check plan details.</p>
        <p>Some academic experts compared the old and new versions of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> plan finder and confirmed the problems flagged by hands-on users.</p>
        <p>Their review also found improvements. Among them:</p>
        <p>- The new plan finder automatically fills in all of a consumer’s medications that that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> paid for, if the enrollee enters their <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> number. (Consumer advocates recommend double-checking this list.)</p>
        <p>- The new tool can be used more easily on mobile devices and tablets.</p>
        <p>- The revamped plan finder allows consumers to compare across Part D drug plans and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> Advantage plans, which offer comprehensive medical coverage.</p>
        <p>“The new plan finder is in many ways improved, but it did take a meaningful step backward by not doing more to highlight its most useful output- the total cost estimate,” said Brian McGarry, an assistant professor at the University of Rochester in New York. He’s the lead author of a recent online article about the plan finder for Health Affairs.</p>
        <p>Seniors have until Dec. 7 to pick or switch “Part D” prescription drug plans or, if they’re seeking comprehensive medical care through a private insurer, a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> Advantage plan. Coverage takes effect Jan. 1.</p>
