      <p>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - The state of Delaware has teamed up with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a> to help people seeking treatment for opioid addiction.</p>
      <p>The News Journal reported Thursday that words related to the opioid crisis are searched for in Delaware more than in any other state. But the top set of results won’t lead to local information or someone who can help.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a> is trying to change that. It will curate an information box for people searching for addiction treatment. It will include a hotline as well as a link to information specific to Delaware.</p>
      <p>Delaware is the first state to team up with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a> as well as the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids.</p>
      <p>The initiative comes at a time when the state is on pace to match last year’s record-setting death toll of 400 fatal overdoses.</p>
