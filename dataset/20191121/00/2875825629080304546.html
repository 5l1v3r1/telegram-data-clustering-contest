      <h2>Moreno has led Spain to next summer's Euro 2020 finals after taking the reins from Enrique in March - but now former Barcelona boss is back in charge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:21:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:21</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Robert Moreno said the end of his spell as Spain boss was "bittersweet" as he released a lengthy statement after being replaced by Luis Enrique.</p>
      <p>Enrique returned to the Spain hotseat this week, despite Moreno having overseen seven wins in nine games and qualified for next summer's Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>Moreno had stepped in back in March after Enrique's daughter Xana had been taken ill having been diagnosed with cancer. She passed away in August.</p>
      <p>But Enrique now makes an emotional return to the international post for Euro 2020 and has been handed a contract until the 2022 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Moreno left the Wanda Metropolitano in tears after Spain wrapped up their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a 5-0 victory over Romania.</p>

      <p>And in a statement released on Wednesday, Moreno said: "After what happened in these last days and after the agreement reached on Tuesday, November 19, I feel the need to make a statement to thank the support received during these months and say goodbye to the position of national coach.</p>
      <p>"Faced with an extreme situation like the one we lived in Malta, I had to assume the leadership of everyone's team. The objective of the classification entrusted to me has been achieved comfortably. I wish this situation had never occurred. Now we would be equally classified.</p>
      <p>"Assessing the last hours in office or even the last days, would only serve to enter a spiral of reproaches and justifications for each of the parties.</p>
      <p>"I am not going to do it. I don't see any sense. I have a clear conscience. It is impossible to please everyone, but I sincerely tell you that I respect all and all opinions.</p>
      <p>"I have always maintained that I am a man of my word, which would not be an impediment in the event that Luis Enrique decided to retrain.</p>

      <p>"I have done so even though it has meant my departure. I wish him well because his joys will be ours.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to all the players for their dedication and delivery in all concentrations. I have tried to be fair, honest and direct with them. I wanted to help them develop their task in the field in the best possible way.</p>
      <p>"I want to emphasize that it would not have been possible for me to develop this task without Luis Enrique, Rafel, Joaquín and Jesús.</p>
      <p>"I don't lose a staff, what I leave behind are friends. Without forgetting the auxiliaries, very important people in a team and who are never sufficiently recognised.</p>
      <p>"I have felt the affection of the people and I can only say thank you. Thanks to the hundreds of strangers who have come to cheer me up and congratulate me. I carry you forever in my heart.</p>

      <p>"I thank all the members of the Royal Spanish Football Federation for the treatment received during my stay in the national team. I have felt loved and respected.</p>
      <p>"And finally a special mention to the media for the treatment you have given me at all times. You have been very insightful in all press conferences.</p>
      <p>"I have tried to be respectful to everyone and I have tried to serve without distinction and trying to be kind and sincere.</p>
      <p>"I hope you value me for what I have done, not for who I am. It is what I have tried to do in the selection with the players in each call.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to stop apologising to anyone who feels offended for not giving the last press conference. Circumstances prevented me.</p>
      <p>"My experience as an absolute coach began and ended in the same way, with bittersweet flavor. I have to look forward and face new challenges as a coach in my passion, football. I am prepared to face the challenge of leading new projects."</p>
      <p>Moreno had previously been Enrique's assistant at Spain as well as at Roma, Celta Vigo and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> .</p>
