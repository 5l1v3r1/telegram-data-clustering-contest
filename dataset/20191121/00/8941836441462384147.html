      <p>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Rhode Island House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello says he’ll consider whether to ban the sale of flavored vaping products in the next legislative session.</p>
      <p>Massachusetts lawmakers passed a groundbreaking ban Thursday on the sale of flavored tobacco and vaping products, sending it to the governor.</p>
      <p>Mattiello, a Democrat, said Thursday the House will address vaping, a “very serious health concern.” He says he anticipates robust committee hearings and looks forward to testimony from medical experts.</p>
      <p>A Senate spokesman says the Senate president also expects legislation to be submitted and reviewed after they convene in January.</p>
