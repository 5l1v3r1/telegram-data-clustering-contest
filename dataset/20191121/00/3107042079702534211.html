      <p>The liquor licence application for a contentious planned liquor store in Christchurch has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/star-news/star-christchurch/local-board-joins-fight-against-bottle-shop">A record-breaking 207 objections were submitted to the city council over the proposed bottle shop on Memorial Ave in Fendalton</a>.</p>
      <p>The applicant, Manpreet Kaur, who also owns Sockburn Bottle-O, withdrew the application on Wednesday for an off-licence consent for the Memorial Ave store.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, starnews.co.nz revealed the Fendalton-Waimairi-Harewood Community Board requested the right to voice its opposition to the planned bottle shop at a district licensing committee hearing.</p>
      <p>Fendalton resident and neighbour of the proposed shop, Isobel Anderson, was "absolutely ecstatic" the application had been withdrawn.</p>
      <p>"I just didn't think that could ever happen," she said.  </p>
      <p>"It was so frightening someone could come in and upset a whole community. It's just such a relief."</p>
      <p>Those who made submissions against the liquor licence were notified about the withdrawal by the district licensing committee on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Fendalton resident Ashley Seaford said the result was good news for the community and its young people.</p>
      <p>"From the number of submissions clearly there was no, or little, support for this business in our neighbourhood," he said.</p>
