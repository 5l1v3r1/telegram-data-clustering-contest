      <p>You no longer have to choose between sound quality and portability when buying a new pair of headphones. Wireless headphones, in general, used to distort audio a lot, but these days they’re getting pretty close to wired sound quality. Fortunately, this Black Friday there are all kinds of extravagant deals on some of these wireless wonders. Some of the biggest retailers on Earth are rolling out incredible deals on Bluetooth headphones from some of the leading manufacturers in the industry. Target, Walmart, and Best Buy all have massive savings on wireless headphones from Bose and BeatsByDre this holiday season.</p>
      <p>Here are the best Black Friday deals on Bluetooth headphones for the music lover in your life. Or maybe just for yourself, if you're looking to save big on studio-quality sound. Some of these deals may not be available just yet, but they should closer to the actual Black Friday event.</p>

      <p>Even a few years ago, if you wanted good sound quality, you had to go with a pair of over-the-ear headphones. You wouldn't want to enjoy bass-heavy music <i>and </i>have a good hair day, or maybe, you know, wear a hat when it's freezing outside.</p>
      <p>The Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones changes all of that. They offer Bose's trademark top-of-the-line sound quality, with smooth, even frequency response across the entire human hearing range. Now you can listen to your favorite music of any and every genre without having to resort to bulky earmuff-style headphones.</p>
      <p>You'll be able to listen to no matter where you or what you're doing, as well. The Bose SoundSport are designed for intensive workouts, so they're water- and sweat-resistant. You won't have to worry about them slipping, either, with Bose's patented StayHear+ design. These earbuds will stay where you put them, for as long as you want them in. Which can be a long time, if you so choose, with a healthy 6-hour battery life.</p>
      <p>You'll enjoy impressive savings, as well, if you pick up a pair of Bose SoundSport headphones from Walmart this year. They're on sale for the low price of $129, on sale from $149.</p>

      <p>Beats By Dre's flagship Bluetooth headphones, the Solo3, are available at an unbeatable price from Target this Black Friday. After selling out on Black Friday, these headphones are back at a Black Friday price for a limited time. </p>
      <p>All of BeatsByDre's headphones have a reputation for their low-end response, but this is particularly true of the Solo3, thanks to their over-the-ear design. For the hip-hop lover and dance music aficionado, these are the Bluetooth headphones for you. BeatsByDre makes no pretension about creating flat, studio-like monitoring headphones. These are for people who love their bass and love it <i>loud</i>. Just because it's fierce doesn't have to mean it's unintelligible, however.</p>
      <p>There are all the other features you'd expect from a good pair of Bluetooth headphones as well. Most notably is the exceptional 40-hour battery life, the longest we've found so far on the market. There's also the hands-free connectivity, to answer phone calls or integrate with your virtual assistant.</p>
      <p>Then there's the design. You'll feel like you're wearing a cloud, with the Solo3's unbelievably comfortable cushioned ear cups. You can get them in a wide array of colors, as well. The BeatsByDre are available in Brick Red, Turf Green, Asphalt Gray, and Break Blue so you can color coordinate with your favorite outfits or sneakers.</p>
      <p>The BeatsByDre Solo3's are an unbeatable deal at only $180, on sale from $300, saving you 40 percent.</p>
