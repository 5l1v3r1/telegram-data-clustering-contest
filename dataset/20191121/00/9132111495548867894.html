      <p>“A ‘No’ vote is a victory for a good decision for Ghana. We are better off with the current system at the Assemblies because partisanship at the Assemblies would bring confusion,” Ofosu- Ampofo said in an interview monitored by MyNewsGh.com.</p>
      <p>The National Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) Speaking in an interview on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen, explained a ‘YES’ vote will further restrict the nation, particularly local communities along the lines of New Patriotic Party (NPP) and NDC.</p>
      <p>“The same violent situation at the national level would happen at the local level if the Assemblies’ election becomes partisanship and if we don’t take care we would have NPP and NDC sanitation days. We don’t need partisanship at the local level,” he said.</p>
      <p>According to Chairman Ofosu-Ampofo, the party’s position on the referendum has been one and already communicated.</p>
