      <p>In September this year, Valve surprisingly released a new <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/valve-deploys-new-half-life-2-update-fixing-a-five-year-old-blinking-issue/">Half-Life 2 update</a> and fixed an NPC blinking issue that has plagued the game for more than five years. Today, it is Portal 2’s turn as a new Portal 2 update has been released, improving the local co-op multiplayer experience.</p>
      <p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/new-steam-sale-unleashed-to-celebrate-the-full-launch-of-remote-play-together/">New Steam Sale Unleashed to Celebrate the Full Launch of Remote Play Together</a></p>
      <p>The new Portal 2 update was released on Steam alongside the new Steam sale and the launch of the Remote Play Together feature. The biggest addition in the new Portal 2 update is that you can now play local co-op with one player using a controller and the other a mouse and keyboard combo, making it easier than ever to enjoy some Portal 2 local co-op.</p>
      <p>With the release of Remote Play Together, it is also now possible to play Portal 2 in split-screen co-op with someone over the internet who doesn’t even own the game. Check out the details of the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/56268/">Portal 2 update</a> from Valve below.</p>
