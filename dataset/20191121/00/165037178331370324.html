      <h1>Bielsa backs Pochettino to land top job after 'brilliant' Tottenham work</h1>

        <b>Mauricio Pochettino will capitalise on the credit he built up at Tottenham elsewhere, according to former mentor Marcelo Bielsa.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b> will get the chance to<b> take charge of one of the best teams in the world </b>due to his efforts at <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham,</a> <b>Marcelo Bielsa says.</b></p>
      <p>Spurs sacked Pochettino this week afte<b>r just five wins in 17 matches </b>in all competitions this season and replaced him with former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United manager<b> Jose Mourinho.</b></p>
      <p>The<b> 47-year-old</b>'s departure came less than <b>six months after he led Spurs to their first Champions League final, </b>where they were beaten 2-0 by Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Bielsa, who<b> coached Pochettino as a young player </b>at Newell's Old Boys and has been credited with<b> influencing his post-playing career,</b> says reaching that final showed just how well the Spurs side had been constructed even in a season in which no players were signed.</p>
      <p>Bielsa <b>now expects Pochettino to be given a chance</b> by one of the world's top clubs.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to talk, not about the relationship I have with Pochettino, but for <b>what I have observed in English football," </b>the <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/leeds-united-afc/">Leeds United</a> boss said on Thursday.</p>

      <p><b>"The work Pochettino has done is brilliant.</b> In the last year, he put Tottenham in a high level in the world. For any coach, it's a very important achievement. For Pochettino, I think it's even more important because the team that played in the Champions League last year was <b>a team he built very carefully."</b></p>
      <p>"The performance of this team was more<b> linked by collective play rather than top players being bought</b> for them. They didn't buy big players to achieve this. This reality makes <b>Pochettino's work even more important".</b></p>
      <p>"People who work professionally like that<b> earn absolutely deserved credit.</b> Maybe he couldn't enjoy this credit at Tottenham. But he will take this credit and <b>big teams in the world will look to capitalise on it".</b></p>
      <p>"For sure, he is a manager who will lead one of the best teams in the world. <b>He made Tottenham one of the most important teams in the world".</b></p>
      <p><b>"I have a lot of affection and respect for Mauricio.</b> When something that is not good happens to him, I can't ignore it. If we look at the close effect of the situation, we can be sad. <b>I feel sad".</b></p>
      <p>"But in 15 days, he'll be at the top again, because when you see things from a distance, without looking at recent facts, then you can realise what you've really achieved".</p>
      <p>"Now, he leaves a team that is attractive to Mourinho – that <b>has a lot of value.</b> The next team who take him will express again the respect Pochettino has created."</p>
