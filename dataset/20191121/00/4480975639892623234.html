      <p>Extending its sustained run-up beyond 200-day SMA and a descending trend line since May-end, USD/CAD is all set to challenge 1.3340/50 supply-zone while taking the bids to 1.3315 during early Thursday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad">Loonie</a> pair’s successful break of the key <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> (now support) pushes buyers towards another upside barrier that comprises multiple highs marked since early-August and 50% Fibonacci retracement of December 2018 to July 2019 downpour, around 1.3340/50.</p>
      <p>Also supporting the pair’s rise are bullish signals from 12-bar Moving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD).</p>
      <p>However, September month high near 1.3385 and 61.8% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> retracement level of 1.3420 become crucial for bulls to conquer ahead of aiming at the yearly resistance-line, at 1.3460 now.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, pair’s declines below 1.3280/75 support confluence, including 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and multi-month-old falling trend line, could recall 1.3200 on the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> whereas a three-week-long rising support line, at 1.3170, could challenge bears afterward.</p>
