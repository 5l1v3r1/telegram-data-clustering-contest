      <p><b>Benghazi.</b> Forces loyal to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar said they shot down an Italian drone in western Libya, flying in a zone under their control.</p>
      <p>"We shot down the Italian drone with an anti-aircraft missile, north of Tarhouna," the rear base of Haftar's forces, southeast of Tripoli, said Haftar's spokesman Ahmad al-Mesmari.</p>
      <p>"We are still waiting for an explanation about the reasons why the drone flew over Libyan territory," Mesmari added.</p>
      <p>Italy's ministry of defence said earlier that the drone "crashed on Libyan territory while carrying out a mission" to ensure the safety of oil platforms and fishermen off Libya.</p>
      <p>"An investigation is under way to determine the causes of the incident," Rome said in a brief statement, adding that "the flight plan was previously communicated to the Libyan authorities".</p>

      <p>The pro-Haftar forces initially announced that they had shot down a Turkish drone.</p>
      <p>It comes days after the UN's Libya envoy pleaded with foreign actors to honour an arms embargo.</p>
      <p>Ghassan Salame said "external parties" were operating drone strikes that are increasing civilian casualties, adding that the growing use of experienced mercenaries was intensifying the conflict.</p>
      <p>Libya has been mired in chaos since a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p>
      <p>The UN-recognised Government of National Accord is contested by a parallel administration in the east, backed by Haftar.</p>
      <p>Haftar launched an offensive on April 4 with his self-proclaimed Libyan National Army to take the capital, but the conflict's frontlines have moved little.</p>
      <p>Faced with a standoff, the two sides have turned to sophisticated weaponry in the hope of gaining an advantage in a battle that has killed over 1,000, injured close to 6,000 and forced 120,000 people from their homes, according to UN figures.</p>
      <p>Haftar is backed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE, while Turkey and Qatar back his rival.</p>
