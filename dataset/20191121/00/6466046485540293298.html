      <p>Houston - Shortages of <b>low-sulfur fuel </b>oil could appear at some ports in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia next year, but most major ports around the world will have adequate supplies, panelists at a shipping industry conference said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards take effect Jan. 1 that <b>cap the sulfur content</b> of shipping fuel at 0.5% unless vessels use exhaust-cleaning scrubbers. The mandate aims to improve human health by reducing air pollution from sea-going vessels.</p>
      <p>Overall, supplies of the <b>cleaner-burning fuel </b>will be available at the start of the year, said panelists at a Mare Forum USA conference. However, shortages in some places force vessels to detour to ports with ample supplies, said Maria Burns, a supply chain specialist. She said any diversions would be costly for fuel sellers and ship owners.</p>
      <p>Only about 6%, or <b>3,000</b>, of the worldâ€™s 55,000 ocean-going vessels are expected to have scrubbers installed by 2020, far less than originally expected, said Burns, an assistant professor at the University of Houston.</p>
      <p>Global marine fuel oil consumption could reach 5 million barrels a day (bpd) by 2020 and rise to <b>8 million bpd by 2040</b>, she added. Compounding supply issues, global refiners have not been able to guarantee the quality and compatibility of the shipping fuels they supply, said Sean Kline, a director at industry group Chamber of Shipping of America.</p>
