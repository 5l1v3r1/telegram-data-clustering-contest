      <p>The partnership of cereal manufacturer Kellogg’s and Deliveroo could be dismissed as a PR gimmick, but in fact it points toward a future where food manufacturers act more like restaurants brands and deliver unique and personalized food at scale.Kellogg's Kitchen Creations on the Deliveroo platform offers 27 sweet and savoury dishes, all made with Kellogg’s ingredients. Coco Pops Bubble Crepes, Bran Flakes Falafel Wrap and Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut Peanut Butter Shake are on the menu for Deliveroo customers in Blackwall and Canary Wharf, London. All dishes are vegetarian and vegan.</p>
      <p>The tie-up is a clue as to the future of how food brands reach and sell to consumers. And that clue in lies in both Deliveroo and an unrelated UK robotics company.</p>

      <p>Karakuri is a small London-based startup that combines robotics, automation and machine learning to help, “restaurants remain viable in challenging times,” according to the website. “We enable people to do what they do best, be creative and interact with customers, rather than wasting time doing mundane repetitive jobs.”</p>
      <p>In May 2019, Karakuri received <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2019/05/09/ocado-makes-first-tech-startup-investment-in-robotics-firm-karakuri/#c5e47ac725b4">£4.75 million of investment from Ocado</a>. But the goals of Karakuri don’t necessarily sit in innovation for restaurant operators alone, but in better serving consumers, no matter where they come from. “We believe that by using robotics we can offer the consumer a greater choice of healthy food, allowing them to customise their meals to suit themselves,” the website explains.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And why is the investment from Ocado significant? Ocado CEO Tim Steiner says Karakuri robots are a “potential game-changer in food to go”. The DK-One model can currently use up to 48 ingredients to create individualised and personalised meals or food items, producing up to 360 meals each hour, or one every 10 seconds.</p>
      <p>This means that Ocado can start thinking about food as a personlized solution, offering its retailer customers Karakuri’s technology and offering food and drink brands the ability to offer personalised food to shoppers.</p>
      <p>So what’s this got to do with Deliveroo? In May 2019, Deliveroo announced that Amazon planned to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2019/05/17/amazon-leads-575-million-investment-into-food-delivery-startup-deliveroo/#1e13ab25618c">invest $575 million</a> into the takeaway delivery service. And Deliveroo’s ambitions go way beyond delivering takeaways, as the company’s founder has stated he wants Deliveroo to become the definitive food company and aim to deliver people three meals a day.</p>
      <p>If you are Kellogg’s – or any other packaged food and drink brand – this means that the future of food shopping means moving beyond physical supermarket stores and into emerging sales channels, such as Deliveroo. But how does a brand such as Kellogg’s – used to making lots of the same product – satisfy consumers that become increasingly used to endless options in endless scroll apps? They figure out how to move beyond ambient packaged goods and into offering hot food and ambient individualized food items.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>While Kellogg’s trial with Deliveroo is a small-scale production kitchen today, it’s not too much of a leap of the imagination to picture ‘dark kitchens’ (i.e. kitchens not accessible to the public) staffed with Karakuri robots, making persoanalized menu items delivered by Deliveroo or Ocado.</p>
      <p>This combination of food manufacturer brand recognition, with modern robotics and logistics allows packaged good manufacturers to provide personalization at scale and remain relevant to the Deliveroo generation. Imagine, Nestle allowing you to make your own customized Kit Kat ice creams, or Birds Eye allowing you to take one of its family meals and tweak it to each family member’s taste, food preferences or allergies.</p>
      <p>When the robots take over, they’ll come with takeaways from brands that became famous in the 19th and 20th century.</p>
