      <h3>Invictus Obi To Forfeit N280m To FG</h3>
      <p>A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos State has ordered <b>Obinwanne Okeke</b>, popularly known as <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/invictus-obi/"><u>Invictus Obi</u></a></b> to finally forfeit to the Federal Government, the sum of N280,555,010 traced to him.</p>
      <p>The order was given on Thursday by Justice Rilwan Aikawa following the submissions of the <b>Economic and Financial Crimes Commission</b> (EFCC) Counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo.</p>
      <p>The EFCC had told the court that the funds were domiciled in Nigerian bank accounts of Invictus Oil and Gas Limited and Invictus Investment Limited, respectively.</p>
      <p>Recall the court had earlier in October, approved the <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/07/court-approves-forfeiture-of-n280m-linked-to-invictus-obi/"><u>temporary forfeiture</u></a></b> of N280,555,010.65 found in bank accounts belonging to two companies owned by Obinwanne Okeke also known as Invictus Obi.</p>

      <p>It will be recalled that Okeke is standing trial in the United States of America for an alleged $11m cyber fraud following his indictment <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/08/23/full-list-of-nigerians-arrested-by-fbi-for-alleged-involvement-in-internet-fraud/"><u>alongside 77 other Nigerians</u></a></b>.</p>
      <p>Okeke was in 2016 celebrated by Forbes International as one of Africa’s most outstanding 30 entrepreneurs under the age of 30 and described by the magazine as “proof that there is hope for Africa.”</p>
      <p>But he was arrested in August this year by the American Federal Bureau of Investigation as the ringleader of a cybercrime syndicate, which had defrauded a number of American citizens to the tune of $11m “through fraudulent wire transfer instructions in a massive coordinated business email compromise scheme.”</p>
