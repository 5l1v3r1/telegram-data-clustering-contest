        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Gordon Sondland</a>, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, entered the House intelligence committee hearing on impeachment as the Democrats’ best hope of bringing the hammer to President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s head.</p>
      <p>He left atop a wave of presumption.</p>
      <p>In other words: The anticipated big bombsheller dropped a big nothingburger.</p>
      <p>He started by insisting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> was guilty, through his attorney Rudy Giuliani, of demanding <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> announce an investigation into the 2016 elections, into Joe and Hunter Biden, into the Burisma Holdings company that paid Hunter Biden a reported $50,000 per month to serve as a board member. And so on. He finished by saying that all this insistence was actually presumption and assumption.</p>
      <p>Based on what he thought and how he interpreted, he presumed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> was guilty of a quid pro quo. He assumed that’s what Giuliani meant.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Here’s the you-gotta-be-kidding-me moment, though: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a> even testified to the fact that he was told explicitly by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> — directly, not through another source; not by another’s mouth — that he, the president, did not want a quid pro quo.</p>
      <p>The exact quote?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a> said when he asked the president what he wanted in respect to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> (who was in a bit of a grumpy mood that day) said: “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell [President] Zelensky to do the right thing.”</p>
      <p>Bam.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Exoneration.</p>
        <p>But not so fast, says a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>-hating press. The left must have its pound of flesh.</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a>’s impeachment testimony proves <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> foreign policy is run by corrupt clowns,” USA Today <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/11/21/sondland-impeachment-testimony-shows-trump-dangers-corruption-column/4251763002/">said</a> in a headline.</p>
        <p>“Gordon Sondland Leaves Us With No Other Option,” The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/opinion/gordon-sondland-impeachment-ukraine.html">wrote</a>. “The case is simple, and the evidence supporting impeachment is now crystal clear.”</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a> ‘absolutely convinced’ delay in aid was linked to investigations,” CBS News <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMgIclly_3w">wrote</a>.</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a> confirms quid pro quo in impeachment hearing,” CNN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDNcnlaKIhk">reported</a>.</p>
        <p>What a joke.</p>
        <p>Here’s the truth: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a> confirms he presumed quid pro quo was the president’s intent. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a> assumed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> wanted aid withheld in return for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> stating publicly its government was kicking off an investigation into Team Biden, circa 2016.</p>
        <p>But impeachment is not a matter for assumption and presumption.</p>
        <p>Democrats seem to be trying to weave together a string of anecdotal evidence based on second- and third-person hearsay, presumption, assumption and interpretation — that last, of not just words but thoughts and motivations and mindsets of the president — and hoping, based on repetition, that an impeachable offense sticks. But that’s neither just, nor justice.</p>
        <p>And shame on the media for playing along.</p>
        <p>“[Adam] Schiff: Trump Doesn’t Need To Say Words ‘I Am Bribing The Ukrainian President,’ ” NBC News reported, in context of describing the standards to prove quid pro quo, or bribery, or whatever, and impeach.</p>
        <p>No. No <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> doesn’t.</p>
        <p>But the witnesses the Democrats bring to testify that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> committed an impeachable offense should have something more than a presumption. After all, this is America. There is no such thing as thought crime — but there is such a thing as innocent until proven guilty.</p>
