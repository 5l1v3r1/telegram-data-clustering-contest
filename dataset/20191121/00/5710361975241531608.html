      <h1>Oil declines as U.S.-China standoff extends beyond trade</h1>

      <p>LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Thursday as fresh tensions between the United States and China over protests in Hong Kong fueled concern that a deal to end a trade war between the world's top two economies may be further delayed.</p>
      <p>Brent crude (<a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/brent-oil">LCOc1</a>) fell 28 cents, or 0.4%, to $62.12 a barrel by 1122 GMT, while West Texas Intermediate crude (<a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil">CLc1</a>) was down 23 cents, or 0.4%, at $56.78.</p>
      <p>Both benchmarks had risen strongly on Wednesday due to bullish data on U.S. crude inventories.</p>
      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign two bills passed by Congress intended to support protesters in Hong Kong. That followed a Reuters report that completion of a "phase one" U.S.-China trade deal could slide into next year.</p>
      <p>The potential delay could mean the U.S. administration will implement new tariffs on imports from China, escalating the tensions, experts say.</p>
      <p>"Under this scenario, both equities and oil are expected to come under pressure. As talks hit a snag, an upside breakout from the current trading range all of a sudden has become less imminent," Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM said.</p>
      <p>However, in an attempt to allay fears, the Chinese commerce ministry said that China would strive to reach a "phase one" trade agreement with the United States.</p>
      <p>The Wall Street Journal also reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources, that China had invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of talks in Beijing.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, data from the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude stocks had risen by a less-than-expected 1.4 million barrels in the week to Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>OPEC and its allies are likely to extend oil output cuts until mid-2020 when they meet next month, with non-OPEC producer Russia supporting Saudi Arabia's push for stable oil prices amid the listing of state oil giant Aramco.</p>
      <p>OPEC sources told Reuters that formally announcing deeper cuts looked unlikely for now although a message about better compliance with existing curbs could be sent to the market.</p>
      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Russia and OPEC had "a common goal" of keeping the oil market balanced and predictable, and Moscow would continue cooperation under a global deal cutting oil supply.</p>
      <p>"Russian commitment on an extended supply-curb deal, though supportive of oil prices, will continue to struggle against headwinds on global trade issues," said Benjamin Lu, analyst at Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures.</p>
