      <p>The band was created by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett and consists of four animated members including Stuart "2-D" Pot, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle and Russel Hobbs that exist in a phantasmic universe. The documentary, <i>Gorillaz: Reject False Icons, </i>directed by Denholm Hewlett, was filmed over the course of three years, two albums and one world tour.</p>

      <p>It features appearances from Vince Staples, Pusha T, Danny Brown, Yasiin Bey and more. We expect more content after this new film as Albarn has also stated that a new album is in the works.</p>
