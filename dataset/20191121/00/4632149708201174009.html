      <p><i>The Homegrown stage of the upcoming FiveSixZero music summit and festival is all about partying with your favourite Bengaluru DJs. Are you ready? </i><br/><br/><b>DJ Ivan</b> <br/>He needs no introduction. DJ Ivan’s versatility and grasp over various genres of music, combined with his integration of captivating imagery and strongly written words, have ensured that a night with him at the console will create an ambience that is not only a celebration of his unique style but also of music in general, as he oscillates between sounds that thrill, soothe and entrance the music fans. His talent isn’t confined to the console and decks. He is quite well known for his encyclopedic knowledge of music. <br/><br/><b>Rishav Chhabra</b> <br/>What distinguishes him from others is his ability to weave a story in every set he plays. That’s because he believes that a DJ set is not complete unless he can possibly take his listeners on a journey of music with him. <br/><br/><b>Roan Shenoy</b> <br/>He kicked off his musical career at the age of 21, by opening for some of the city’s biggest DJs that time. He followed this up by starting his own radio show/podcast Redemption Radio, where he invited up and coming DJs from all over the world. After that, he flew to London to study production at Point Blank Music School. There, he met like-minded musicians and started experimenting with different sounds. Finally, in 2017, he dropped his first single. And guess what? Two weeks later, two-time No 1 DJ, DJ Hardwell premiered that track on his show, Hardwell On Air. There has been no looking back for this young champ since. <br/><br/><b>Shine</b> <br/>He has been spinning the decks for about a decade now and that’s got him open for some of the best DJs in the world. <br/><br/><b>Fake Tattoos<br/></b><br/>His sounds are inspired by eastern oriental, desert house, Indian and Sufi music. Mix that with the electronic music and you get a new genre called mystic genre, which he’s developed. His famous India-inspired house single Rupaiye Wala is still aired on BBC Radio at times and another single Pardesi was aired on BBC Asian Network for a consecutive 10 weeks. All this and more has made him a global name and won him support from legends such as Tiesto and Cedric Gervais. He also believes musicians must collaborate and push the boundaries of their art. <br/><br/><b>Martin Dsouza</b> <br/>He is a man of many talents. When he isn’t deejaying, he loves to dabble in acting and a little bit of creative writing. <br/><br/><br/><i>Attend the FiveSixZero music summit and fest from November 22 to 24, at The Lalit Ashok, Kumarakrupa Road, tickets on bookmyshow.com, details on fivesixzero.in</i></p>
