      <p>Department store major <b>Kohl’s (NYSE: KSS) </b>saw its stock price decline by about 20% on Tuesday, on account of a weaker than expected set of Q3 FY’20 results (FY ends January). While the company’s adjusted EPS stood at $0.74 versus the consensus estimate of $0.86, same-store sales growth came in at 0.4%, missing the consensus of 0.8%. The company’s margins also took a hit on account of higher competition, which has led to discounting, and also due to higher expenses. Kohl’s also cut its full-year EPS target to $4.75 to $4.95 from $5.15 to $5.45, indicating that the Holiday quarter is likely to be a difficult one for the company.We ‘step back’ from these recent swings to review Kohl’s<b><i> </i></b>performance over the last few years, as a context for what might come next.
