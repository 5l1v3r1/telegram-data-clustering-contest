      <p><b>TD CEO Bharat Masrani knows when to hold, or fold, when the stakes are high: </b>Do you ever watch poker tournaments on TV?

Toronto-Dominion Bank chief executive Bharat Masrani is one of those card sharks, caught in the late stages of a high stakes game in the U.S. discount brokerage industry. By all accounts, Mr. Masrani is about to do the sensible thing, and fold. It’s in keeping with an approach that colleagues say drives all the TD boss’s strategic decisions: Don’t do anything that could blow up the bank. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-td-ceo-bharat-masrani-knows-when-to-hold-or-fold-when-the-stakes-are/">Opinion</a> (Andrew Willis)</p>
