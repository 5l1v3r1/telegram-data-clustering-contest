      <p><i>Top cop says SIT has been formed to probe deeper into scandal </i><br/><br/>KPL players were honey trapped and blackmailed into match fixing by bookies,” revealed city police commissioner Bhaskar Rao on Wednesday. Speaking to the media about the on going investigation by the CCB into the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) match fixing, he said that he has formed a Special Investigation team (SIT) inside the CCB to investigate the matter. <br/><br/>He said that a few players and team owners had made Indian Premier League (IPL) and Karnataka Premier League (KPL) a big business to make huge money out of it. <br/><br/>“During the investigation it was revealed that bookies had been sending players to foreign tours. They made them stay in five-star hotels where they laid a honey trap for them and then blackmailed them to fix matches. Since the beginning of IPL, KPL and other domestic leagues, betting and match-fixing has become rampant. They make money like this and not by winning trophies,” he said. <br/><br/>He said regulatory bodies of the game like BCCI and KSCA have remained “mute spectators” despite knowing everything. Rao said it is very much in their domain, they should take action. “We have issued notices to all teams asking for videos, scoresheet, details of the managers and others. I have formed a small SIT (Special Investigation Team) within the CCB to go deep into this. Let’s see where it goes,” he added. <br/><br/>He stressed on the fact that there are more people watching cricket than those playing it on the field. “They spend their hard-earned money and watch cricket matches without knowing that the result of the match is already decided by the bookies. Several senior players have expressed the need to cleanse cricket and that the guilty should be booked,” he said, adding action should also be taken against those who remain silent despite knowing things. <br/><br/>The CCB had recently issued a Look Out Circular against the Bellary Tuskers team owner Arvind Venkatesh Reddy while Belagavi Panthers owner Asfak Ali Thara had been arrested earlier. Two players C M Gautam and Abrar Kazi were also recently arrested.</p>
