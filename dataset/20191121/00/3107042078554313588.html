      <h1>A&amp;P show to feature 'spectacular' line-up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/richard.davison%40odt.co.nz" target="_blank">Richard Davison</a></address>
      <p>Organisers are expecting increased entries - and visitors to match - at the West Otago A&amp;P Show on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Society president Robert Kane said the annual celebration of town and country in Tapanui was entering its 106th year ''in good heart''.</p>
      <p>''We've avoided some of the clashes with other events that have occurred in previous years, so we've got boosted entries in some sections, and are expecting a bumper crowd in bright sunshine, if I've prayed to the right weather gods.''</p>
      <p>A ''spectacular'' programme of entertainment, stalls and traditional A&amp;P events had been lined up by the organising committee.</p>
      <p>Included were a demonstration car rescue by the Tapanui Volunteer Fire Brigade, a remote-controlled helicopter display, dog trials, shearing, wood-chopping and pet displays.</p>
      <p>Entertainment would be provided by magician Jonathan Usher, the Otago Museum, fairground rides and several local musicians and dance troupes.</p>
      <p>''The A&amp;P committee always comes up with new and exciting events, as well as the traditional and ever-popular activities.''</p>
      <p>In common with many other A&amp;P shows this summer, cattle would be making a ''welcome'' return to West Otago, following a hiatus because of M. bovis.</p>
      <p>''All the cattle this year will have pre-entered from properties with clear M. bovis history.''</p>
      <p>There would be gaps between each exhibitor in the stalls.</p>
      <p>''The animals will not be making nose-to-nose contact in the showroom or stalls.</p>
      <p>''We're also disinfecting and washing everything down between exhibitors, ensuring full biosecurity measures are in place.''</p>
