      <p>Google Stadia is looking more like Google Plus than Gmail at the present moment, when it comes to its impact on the industry it’s trying to disrupt, but even if the concept of game streaming still does not seem to be taking off, that is not stopping another tech giant from moving ahead with its own plans.That would be Amazon, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-stadia-wants-to-be-the-future-of-gaming-so-do-microsoft-sony-and-amazon/">which CNET reports</a> is still set to announce a rumored game streaming service next year, with most believing it will arrive in time to compete with Xbox Scarlett and PlayStation 5, the next generation of consoles which will be here in the fall.</p>
      <p>Amazon’s history with video games is rather all over the place. Amazon owns Twitch, the market leader (by far) for video game streaming, despite recent inroads by YouTube and Microsoft’s Mixer. But Amazon also has been developing video games with Amazon Game Studios for years, but has yet to produce a substantive title (any big “New World” fans out there?). But now because they believe they have the infrastructure and reach to support it, they’re also going to try to get into game streaming alongside Google Stadia and Microsoft xCloud, among others.</p>
      <p>The fate of Google Stadia is not yet clear, considering it only just launched this week, and many of its games and promised features still have not yet arrived. And yet best case scenario, when reviewed by critics who did not have any problems with the tech (that uh, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/18/google-stadia-launch-review-a-technical-conceptual-disaster/">was not me</a>), the central question about who this is <i>for</i> remains unanswered.</p>

      <p>Cloud game streaming makes more sense when you have something like xCloud that can work as an extension of your current Xbox library or Game Pass roster. But in Google Stadia’s case, it feels like a solution in search of a problem. The gaming industry is enormous, dwarfing all other forms of entertainment, and it’s gotten there with people being perfectly content using hardware to run their games, whether that’s game consoles, PCs or phones. You can’t really say “oh people don’t want to buy consoles” when the industry is selling…hundreds of millions of dollars worth of consoles a year, easily. The tech that allows game streaming to be possible is cool, but something like Stadia’s model, which costs a subscription, plus the purchase of new games, plus most titles don’t share save files across platforms, seems very limited in scope.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear what Amazon’s model will be, but I have to believe everyone over there is looking at the Stadia launch and taking notes. In theory, a true “Netflix” model, where a subscription opens up cloud streaming for a bunch of big name games that don’t have to all be individually purchased, seems like it could find a market and be a welcome alternative to traditional consoles. And yet the games industry does not seem ready for something like that, as if Google can’t convince more games to be a part of its “Pro” plan, I’m not sure why Amazon would have any better luck. And like Google, Amazon has no first party games of note unlike Sony or Microsoft who can at least offer up its own titles as part of subscription plans. Otherwise, it’s like subscribing to Netflix, but then also being forced to purchase each season of a show individually.</p>
      <p>I have no reason to expect an Amazon game streaming service would make any more of an impact than Stadia seems to be at the moment, short of some sort of massive shift in the model that unveils a huge catalog of games offered as part of a low cost subscription. And perfectly working tech, of course. But just because an industry doesn’t <i>need</i> the intrusion of another big tech company, doesn’t mean they won’t try to invade it and plant their flag anyway, so we’ll see how this goes some time in 2020, it seems. Good luck Amazon, you’ll need it.</p>
