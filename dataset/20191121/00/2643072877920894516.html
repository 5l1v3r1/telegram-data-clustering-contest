      <h1>South African Former  Security Minister Arrested For Corruption</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gbenga Sijuade</a></address>
      <p>A former security minister of South Africa and close ally of former<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/05/20/south-africa-ex-president-jacob-zuma-pushes-for-his-corruption-trial-to-be-dropped/"><u><b> president Jacob Zuma</b></u></a> has been arrested on corruption-related charges and appeared in court on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Naija News understands that Bongani Bongo who is also a lawmaker becomes the first high-profile person to be arrested and charged with graft in recent years</p>
      <p>Bongo is accused of offering a bribe to a lawyer who was building the state’s case in a 2017 parliamentary inquiry into the troubled state-owned power utility Eskom.</p>
      <p>Bongo, who currently chairs the home affairs committee in parliament, appeared before a magistrate court and was freed on bail of 5,000 rand (306 euros, $340).</p>
      <p>He was ordered to return to court on January 31.</p>
      <p>Zuma appointed Bongo state security minister just two weeks after he allegedly tried to bribe lawyer Nthutuzela Vanara during a parliamentary probe into Eskom. He lasted only four months in the job before he was removed in a cabinet reshuffle.</p>
      <p>Under Zuma, state-owned companies were at the centre of corruption scandals known as “state capture”.</p>
      <p>Zuma was forced to resign as president in February 2018 by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party after a nine-year reign marred by corruption allegations and dwindling popularity.</p>
      <p>He was ordered to return to court on January 31.</p>
