      <p>Though a brand's purpose isn't necessarily always to make the world a better place to live in, often it is. Ideally, brand purpose is meant to be about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefffromm/2019/10/10/brand-say-vs-brand-do/#40b2f9b45d27">taking some sort of positive action</a>, in genuine, meaningful ways. Brand purpose is more about the brand's values and where the brand is going. Sometimes brands, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/16/daymond-john-backed-sock-start-up-bombas-is-bringing-in-millions.html">like Bombas socks</a>, just remind us to look out for the underdogs in a world of behemoth, heritage brands. With the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/business/business-roundtable-ceos-corporations.html"><b>Business Roundtable's</b></a> recent acknowledgement that the ‘shareholder first’ philosophy is now to be considered <i>passé</i>, and that corporations and their brands have a responsibility to make decisions based on the best outcomes for <i>all</i> stakeholders (shareholders, employees, vendors, customers, and society), the opportunity exists for brands to blaze a trail with their social purpose. The challenge for both new and existing brands is to champion a genuine purpose that is a good fit for the brand, one that helps build long-term relationships with consumers. As for profits, many successful purpose-driven brands have been shown to <a href="https://www.unilever.com/news/press-releases/2019/unilevers-purpose-led-brands-outperform.html">outperform their profit-driven counterparts</a>. </p>
      <p>Aside from better stock performance, better employee morale, and better relationships with loyal customers, brand purpose can also serve as a brand driver. It can serve as a "north star" for decision-making and problem-solving.</p>
      <p>Take the example of Northern California-based <a href="https://www.ju.st/en-us/get-just-egg">JUST Egg</a> (formerly Hampton Creek Eggs). JUST eggs are plant-based, cholesterol-free egg substitutes made from the protein-packed mung bean. JUST eggs are also dairy-free, non-GMO, and their ingredients require less water and emit fewer carbon emissions. Heart- and body-friendly as well as earth-friendly, JUST eggs look, scramble, and taste just like old school eggs.</p>
      <p>One might assume that the JUST egg was created by a well-funded team of corporate scientists. The idea was actually spearheaded by JUST co-founder and CEO Josh Tetrick, who grew up as an undernourished kid, and who wanted to make protein-based nutrition more accessible to the less privileged all over the world. Tetrick's life experience is truly woven into the JUST Egg brand purpose.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The JUST Egg Purpose</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I was raised in Birmingham in the American South, and was pretty much fed a steady diet of cinnamon rolls out of vending machines, nachos and cheese from 7-Eleven, Burger King chicken sandwiches, [and] pretty crappy cafeteria food," says Tetrick. "For much of my life growing up in Alabama, I was on food stamps, and when you're growing up in America and you're on food stamps, you're typically not eating very well, right? You're eating in a way that is not the best for your body, certainly not the best for the planet, and I was no different. That's how I was raised."</p>
      <p>Tetrick had dreams of playing football professionally, but realized after some time at West Virginia University that he didn't feel good enough to play on WVU's team. He considered that maybe football wasn't really his life's calling.</p>
      <p>"I eventually decided to throw my life into something different," he says. "[I] went back and forth in Sub-Saharan Africa. I lived in Kenya for a bit, in Liberia, some other countries. And went there to try to help kids mostly. Help get kids off the streets and into schools."</p>
      <p>While working with the Liberian government and other entities, Tetrick became frustrated working with government and non-profits, and particularly with the (slow) pace at which he felt meaningful change could be implemented.</p>
      <p>"I also saw a lot of kids struggling, saw a lot of kids hungry, saw a lot of kids not eating well," Tetrick recalls. "Even though they were eating differently than I was eating in the South, I certainly saw the connection to them, and that we both were growing up not eating very well."</p>
      <p>After a decision to return to the United States, Tetrick feels fortunate enough to have partnered with someone whom he refers to as a "best friend," also named Josh (Balk). </p>
      <p>"[He] really inspired me to think about making our food system better, healthier, more sustainable, [and] better tasting in [the hope] that if we could figure out a way to do that, we'd end up doing a lot of good for a lot of people, a lot animals, and a lot of our environment," Tetrick says.</p>
      <p>After several months of brainstorming (and living on a friend's couch), Tetrick and Balk settled on tackling a big protein category.</p>
      <p>"It turns out that the egg is one of the most universal proteins on the planet," Tetrick says. "If we could figure out a way to make that one of the world's most universal proteins even better, even healthier, even more cost effective, well then we would have something really exciting. We'd have an entirely new protein category. And the name JUST for us is about healthy, and sustainable, and accessible, and the name Egg is a nod to this universal of all proteins. And we got to work. That's how it started."</p>
      <p>2019 marks the first full calendar year of JUST Egg production and distribution, and the product can be found in <a href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/08/21/JUST-Inc-CEO-The-company-is-JUST-Egg-and-JUST-Egg-is-the-company">20 of the 23 top retailers in the U.S.</a> Early 2019 saw JUST Egg ship the equivalent of the brand's three-millionth egg. Almost eight years after its conception, JUST Egg is <a href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/02/12/Plant-based-JUST-Egg-is-already-outselling-established-liquid-egg-brands-at-retail-claims-Just-CEO">outselling established liquid egg brands</a> like Egg Beaters (ConAgra Brands), and All Whites (Crystal Farms) in dollar sales per store, according to Tetrick.</p>
      <p>JUST has expanded its offerings to include six flavors of <a href="https://www.ju.st/en-us/products/consumer/mayo">JUST Mayo</a>, the brand's non-GMO, egg- and gluten-free mayonnaise substitute. JUST continues looking to expand what it offers with cell-cultured meats like chicken and beef, as well. But for now, the company's primary focus is the egg.</p>
      <p>"Really, really trying to continue to make [JUST Egg] better and for us," Tetrick says. "We're on version 2.0 of the product and we want to make it healthier, [with] more and better protein [and] antioxidants. We want to make it more cost effective so that it's shortly one of the most cost-effective proteins on the planet. And we want to continue to make it taste better. That's a lot of our focus as a company."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Overcoming Challenges</b>
      </p>
      <p>As brands often, if not inevitably, do, JUST has faced its fair share of hurdles.</p>
      <p>Creating a palatable, credible meat or egg substitute in and of itself poses a challenge. Then there's branding, distribution, marketing, etc. The list goes on. </p>
      <p>So a genuine brand purpose isn't generated by the marketing department, it’s ensconced into all elements of the brand's functioning, including the office culture, identity, branding efforts, and operations. A brand's purpose can be part of the brand story.</p>
      <p>The main takeaway here is that genuine purpose truly moves beyond being merely a promotional ploy <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefffromm/2019/10/24/american-express--honest-company-living-their-brand-purpose/">to become a brand's <i>raison d'être</i></a><i>.</i> And that is what truly connects with consumers.</p>
