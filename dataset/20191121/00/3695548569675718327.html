        <b>Renault's Nico Hulkenberg says he does not feel like he is leaving Formula 1, and that he will be ready for any race opportunities in 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 32-year-old driver is currently without a race seat for 2020. He was most recently linked to a deal in IndyCar with Ed Carpenter Racing, though team boss Ed Carpenter said this would not happen on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In F1, he had been holding on to the slim possibility of a seat at Alfa Romeo before it extended Antonio Giovinazzi's deal.</p>
      <p>Hulkenberg had already acknowledged that he would not return to Williams, which is expected to name Formula 2 frontrunner Nicholas Latifi - who is currently a junior driver for the team and has taken part in free practice sessions for the squad - alongside the already confirmed George Russell.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on his current situation, Hulkenberg said: "No regrets.</p>
      <p>"Of course I've done mistakes, like we all do sometimes that I would have liked to avoid, a few moves or things I'd do differently now, but that's always easy to say with hindsight.</p>
      <p>"So all-in-all, I'm at peace with what I've achieved and I don't feel I'm retiring as a race driver.</p>
      <p>"I don't feel I am leaving F1, I might not be on the grid, but if there's an opportunity I'm going to be ready."</p>

      <p>As well as IndyCar rumours, Hulkenberg has also been linked with a drive in the DTM, though he played down the likelihood of such a deal happening.</p>
      <p>"I haven't signed anything, and I won't do for the foreseeable future," Hulkenberg added.</p>
      <p>"I received calls from different, let's say racing series, teams, but nothing is really happening at the moment.</p>
      <p>"To be honest, my state of mind is quite relaxed.</p>
      <p>"I will finish the season anyways and I want to be as successful as possible and then after that, I want to rewind a little, take a moment for myself or two or three, and see what I want to do, what seems of interest.</p>
      <p>"I'm certainly not having the feeling that I want to rush into something, just to race, so I am pretty relaxed.</p>
      <p>"I feel a decade of F1 is intense, living at that high-pace, so that's why I just need to see when the new year starts, how I feel and how things develop and evolve and in which direction.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, at the moment, I just don't know."</p>
      <p>Any hypothetical switch to IndyCar would have to be road-course only for Hulkenberg, as he has confirmed that he does not want to contest oval rounds in the series.</p>
      <p>"Ovals, I've always said I'm not a big fan of it, just doesn't strike me and I think I have too much respect for that, it just seems not my thing," he added.</p>
      <p>"So yeah, I'd keep it limited to the road courses."</p>
