      <h1>Bale's agent about the trouble with the flag: "It's ridiculous"</h1>

        <b>Gareth Bale's representative, Jonathan Barnett, referred to the controversy that has arose regarding the famous flag, that reads "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order."</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It's more than ridiculous". Barnett bluntly said to 'Talk Sport' about <b>the trouble with the flag </b>that Welsh players, <b>including </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Bale</a>, wore after winning a ticket to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>His words, short but clear, had some continuity in 'ESPN'. In this way, the <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Madrid</a> player's agent clarified who was<b> the receiver of the message and that image.</b></p>
      <p><b>"The message was dedicated to the media,"</b> Barnett stated, before speaking about how all this has made the number '11' feel: <b>"He is not worried about the reactions".</b></p>

      <p>Madrid did not welcome this with much enthusiasm. Above all, after the trouble that Bales caused by being called up for the Wales squad when <b>he hadn't played for Real Madrid since the 5th October.</b></p>
