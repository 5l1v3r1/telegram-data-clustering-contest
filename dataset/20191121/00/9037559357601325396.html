      <p>LAHORE: People on Thursday protested against the police's failure to register a child kidnapping case here in the Chuhang village on the city's outskirts, blocking the traffic as they occupied Multan Road.</p>
      <p>Residents of the area, as well as the abducted child's neighbours, staged their protest outside Chuhang police station and chanted slogans against the authorities for their sluggish response to the child's kidnapping.</p>
      <p>The protesters had blocked Multan Road, causing long queues of vehicles that halted in front of the demonstration. They said unidentified men had abducted a child a day earlier but that the police had not registered a first information report (FIR) over the matter even after 24 hours had passed since the alleged kidnapping.</p>
      <p>Protesters dispersed peacefully only after the police held discussions with them, assuring them that an FIR would be filed and the culprits arrested soon.</p>
