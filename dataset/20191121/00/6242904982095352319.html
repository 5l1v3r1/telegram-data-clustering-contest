        <b>Midfielder Kwadwo Asamoah will miss Inter Milan's clash against Torino in serie A on Saturday as he continues with his recovery from a knee injury. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ghana international has been out for weeks now after picking an injury in his side's 2-1 win against Brescia.</p>
      <p>He has however started training separately but Conte will rest him together with Stefano Sensi and Robertyo Giglardini, who are all making swift recoveries from injury.</p>
      <p>It's unlikely that any of these three players will appear for the Nerazzurri in their upcoming game against Torino on Saturday, with even a bench appearance for any of the three unlikely as Conte looks to recover his squad fully in order to avoid exacerbating any injuries.</p>
      <p>Inter are hoping that all three will return in time for their decisive Champions League clashes against Slavia Prague and Barcelona, both must win games</p>
