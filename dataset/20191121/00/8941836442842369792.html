      <h1>Keefe: Toronto has enough talent for quick progress</h1>

      <p>GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) - New <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-maple-leafs/">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Sheldon Keefe</a> spent a decent chunk of a 30-minute morning skate on Thursday teaching instead of running drills.</p>
      <p>There’s a lot for his new team to learn and not much time to do it.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a> is now in charge of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-maple-leafs/">Maple Leafs</a> after veteran coach Mike Babcock was fired Wednesday with the team mired in a six-game losing streak.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a> was officially introduced Thursday morning as the 31st head coach in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-maple-leafs/">Maple Leafs</a> history. He’s got a long history with general manager Kyle Dubas, who hopes <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a> is the right choice to help <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> bounce back from a disappointing 9-10-4 start.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a> believes it can be done.</p>

      <p>“We’ve got a lot of talent and the ability to make life hard on the other team in a lot of ways,” he said. “Focusing on that, we believe, will produce positive results. Because the players are good enough for that to happen.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a> inherits a roster that includes talented forwards like Auston Matthews, John Tavares, Mitch Marner and William Nylander.</p>
      <p>Tavares said there were “many mixed emotions” because Babcock was so dedicated and committed to the team. He said the team feels a burden because it hasn’t played up to expectations but is “turning the page” and moving forward.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Sheldon</a>’s got a great mind for the game,” Tavares said. “We’re excited about the energy and the things he’s bringing and trying to improve from where we’re at.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a> will make his coaching debut during <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a>’s game against the Arizona Coyotes on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Dubas said the franchise must show patience as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a>, a first-time NHL coach, embarks on the difficult task of taking over a team midseason and trying to quickly turn things around.</p>
        <p>He’s confident the players understand there will be ups and down.</p>
        <p>He’s also aware that outside perception might be a little less forgiving.</p>
        <p>“It’s all part of what makes working and playing in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> great,” Dubas said. “You can’t go anywhere in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> without people caring deeply about the team. I read the greatest quote this morning on the way here: ‘You can look at it as a burden or look at it as a trampoline.’”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> is a team that needs quite a bounce.</p>
        <p>The 56-year-old Babcock went 173-133-45 in his four-plus seasons with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> and made the playoffs the past three years, though the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-maple-leafs/">Maple Leafs</a> lost in the first round each time. When the team started slowly this season, Dubas and team President Brendan Shanahan knew it was time for a change.</p>
        <p>Shanahan flew to Arizona on Wednesday to break the news to Babcock, whom he hired in 2015.</p>
        <p>He acknowledged it was a hard day. Some more hard days may follow as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a> tries to quickly implement his system, though the franchise is confident it’s headed in the right direction.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a> was in his fifth season as head coach of the American Hockey League’s Toronto Marlies. He was 199-89-31 with the Marlies and helped the franchise win its first Calder Cup championship in 2018.</p>
        <p>Several of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-maple-leafs/">Leafs</a>’ current players were coached by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-keefe/">Keefe</a> when he was with the Marlies, which is the franchise’s top minor-league affiliate.</p>
