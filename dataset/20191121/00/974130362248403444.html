      <h1>Another Irish Boxer Lands Lucrative Fight With World Champion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Aonghus Ó Maicín</a></address>
      <p>Cork boxer Gary 'Spike' O'Sullivan will face unbeaten Mexican Jaime Munguia, the WBO light middleweight world champion, in San Antonio, Texas on January 11.</p>
      <p>However, the Cork man will not be fighting for Mexican's belt at the Alamodome as Munguia has opted to move up to the 160-pound limite to take on the mustachioed bruiser. The 35-year-old will be returning to the ring for the first time since defeating Khiary Gray in March, though he was preparing to face Diego Adrian Marocchi in August until visa complications postponed the bout.</p>
      <p>Fellow Irishman Dennis Hogan came close to breaking Munguia's unbeaten record last April, a controversial decision meaning the fight was ultimately awarded to the home fighter on home soil. Although promising a rematch, Hogan's efforts have been in vain and he will now instead fight Jermall Charlo for the WBC world middleweight title in New York next month.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless O'Sullivan carries a hefty reputation too having fought David Lemieux, Chris Eubank Jr and Billy Joe Saunders throughout his career. Though he came out on the wrong side of those tussles his name still clearly carries considerable clout with the upcoming fight set to be broadcast on both Dazn and Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>After the announcement O'Sullivan said:</p>
      <blockquote>For me it’s a dream come true to fight the undefeated champion of the world and the number one ranked fighter in the world It makes it even better that he’s Mexican.<br/>I grew up watching the great Mexican champions and to get the opportunity to fight Jaime is an honor. I will leave no stone unturned in my preparation for this fight. I can’t recall feeling more motivated by any other fight in my career thus far. I believe this fight will be a war that the fans will talk about for many years to come.</blockquote>
      <p>Packie Collins will once again be in O'Sullivan's corner at the renowned Texas venue. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>Spike always knew in the back of his mind that one day he would have to fight Jaime Munguia. We have gone through every different scenario of how to approach this fight if it were to take place.<br/>I would like to thank both Jaime, Golden Boy and Murphy’s Boxing for handing Spike this huge opportunity. Come Jan 11, Spike will be ready for whatever Jaime Munguia turns up on the night of the fight.</blockquote>
