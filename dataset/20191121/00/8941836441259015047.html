      <p>TAOS, N.M. (AP) - Taos Air has announced it will begin direct charter flights from Taos to Los Angeles and San Diego area.</p>
      <p>The company said this week it will start direct charter flight service to and from Hawthorne Municipal Airport in Los Angeles and McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, California, beginning Jan. 9.</p>
      <p>Taos Air says it will provide flights under two and a half hours one way at prices comparable to commercial services. That will make it easy for Southern Californians to experience northern New Mexico’s ski resorts.</p>
