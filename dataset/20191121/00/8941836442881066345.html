        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Democrats keep focusing on the negative effects of the Trump delay in providing aid to Ukraine, but they forgot that first, when Russia invaded the Crimea region, then President Obama did not offer any real assistance to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>In 1994 the United States, U.K., Russia and Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum of Security Assurances (renewed in 2009), with Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. In return, it would not need to tolerate an invasion into it or an attack on its sovereignty, and if either happened, the matter would be a fast-track issue for the U.N. Security Council.</p>
      <p>With the Russian-controlled rebel invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Obama provided blankets and Meals Ready to Eat, not defensive weapons. President Trump, on the other hand, provided significant defensive weapons and other aid, and the delay in furnishing these was for a valid reason.</p>
