      <p>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) - Court officials say the upcoming trial of a white man charged with making racist threats against a black activist in Virginia has been postponed.</p>
      <p>A federal judge on Thursday pushed back the trial date for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-mcmahon/">Daniel McMahon</a> of Brandon, Florida. The trial was originally scheduled to start Dec. 23 at the federal courthouse in Charlottesville, but the judge set a new trial date of June 15, 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-mcmahon/">McMahon</a> was charged in August with posting social media messages intended to intimidate activist Don Gathers and interfere with Gathers’ plans to run for a seat on Charlottesville’s city council. An indictment says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-mcmahon/">McMahon</a> expressed white supremacist views on his social media accounts.</p>
