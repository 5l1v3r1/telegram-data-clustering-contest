      <p>Earlier this year, I wrote about the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianvigo/2019/03/01/e-cigarettes-redux-a-society-in-fear-of-mistakes/">cultural differences</a> in how e-cigarettes are approached from North American to Europe and how various countries approach vaping in entirely different manners. Where in the UK vaping has widely been embraced as a stop-smoking tool, in the US there has been far more concern around its use, especially among teenagers. Where <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-an-evidence-update">one report</a> in the UK claims that there is “no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers,” another <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/vaping-teen-smoking-habit/">study</a> in the US “showed a negative correlation between vaping and cigarette habits, where between 2011 and 2015, vaping increased among U.S. high schoolers from 1.5% to 16%.”The debate on whether e-cigarettes help to curb traditional smoking habits or not rages as many medical experts like <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-vaping-help-you-quit-smoking-2019022716086">Robert H. Schmerling</a>, MD of Harvard Health Publishing have weighed in positively on the positive results of those who have either weaned themselves off of tobacco through vaping while others laud vaping in tandem with either <a href="https://qz.com/1721299/doctors-are-prescribing-nicotine-replacements-to-teens-who-vape/">nicotine replacement</a> or <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/online-therapy/">online therapy</a> for addictive behavior among myriad solutions to nicotine dependence.</p>
      <p>Over half a year later, however, greater concern has emerged after the deaths of 42 people in the US alone with the CDC having created a page specifically to update the public on what they have classified as an “outbreak.” Add to this the fact that the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has recently updated its <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">literature</a> on e-cigarettes homing in on E acetate as a “chemical of concern among people with e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI).” Where the CDC has noted that in 29 patients from 10 different states showed vitamin E acetate, as a thickening agent in THC-containing e-cigarette, in all samples it has also underscored the need for future research into these products: “While it appears that vitamin E acetate is associated with EVALI, evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to EVALI. Many different substances and product sources are still under investigation, and it may be that there is more than one cause of this outbreak.” </p>
      <p>While many e-cigarette companies are <a href="https://www.salon.com/2019/11/17/a-regulatory-haze-vape-marketers-are-online-creating-new-headaches-for-feds_partner/">hitting back</a> at the recent wave of deaths in the US as they play around with FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and FTC (Federal Trade Commission) regulations that touch upon the use of influencers and advertising methods, the reality is that companies that review e-cigarettes and online sites like <a href="https://www.vapeactive.com/">Vapeactive</a> and <a href="https://smokefree.net/">Smokefree</a> that cater to this industry are entirely unregulated and are actually pulling a “<a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/news/20191117/vape-companies-borrow-from-big-tobacco-ad-playbook">rinse and repeat</a>” from big tobacco advertising of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
      <p>As the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/irish-heart-foundation-calls-on-state-to-ban-e-cigarette-advertising-1.4086315">Irish Heart Foundation</a> recently called on the government to ban e-cigarettes and editorials in Canada’s <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-its-time-to-treat-e-cigarettes-like-cigarettes/"><i>Globe and Mail</i></a> state that we need to treat e-cigarettes as another type of cigarette assessing Health Canada’s pro-and-con approach to vaping, it is clear that governments are divided as to how urgent vaping deaths are to the public health landscape. Yet how is it that the CDC’s recent evidence that vitamin E acetate is the “primary site of injury within the lungs” for vaping deaths is not making its way north of the border or across the pond despite <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-two-senators-call-for-immediate-action-to-ban-vaping-ads-targeting/">some politicians</a> urging for reform and regulation around vaping? If <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/15/vaping-apps/">Apple</a> can react with a ban on all vaping products, why cannot governments with far less to gain and far more to lose?</p>
      <p>Even aside from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/28/20936888/vaping-lung-illness-symptoms-death-cdc-report">health ramifications</a> associated with vaping, the <a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/10/21/neuroscience-culture-and-the-sins-of-vaping/">social</a> pressures and repercussions linked to vaping are nonetheless <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20191001/Peer-pressure-at-school-influencing-teen-vape-use.aspx">well-documented</a> across North America and Europe. And the Philippines has recently demonstrated that those with vaping health-related issues who have limited <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/16/19/new-public-health-menace-house-leader-wants-vaping-ban-for-minors">financial capacities</a> are exhausting government resources. There are also vested economic interests within the industry as financial backers like <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/tilt-rolls-up-financing-vaping-wins-but-it-still-faces-burned-investors-15155285">TILT</a> enter the vaping market. Despite one’s wealth or poverty, e-cigarettes are proving to be a public relations disaster for socialized medical systems as well as the private health sector. What was just a couple of months ago called a “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/cdc-says-stop-vaping-as-mystery-lung-condition-spreads/">mysterious lung condition</a>” is now understood as a health crisis and was earlier this Fall assigned the name <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vaping-related-illness-has-a-new-name-evali/">EVALI</a> (e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury).</p>
      <p>Still, governments across the planet seem to be on entirely different pages as to how to respond to what many regard as a health emergency. While the division between those politicians who still view vaping as preferable to tobacco consumption among teens and those who see it as just another health threat, the cultural and scientific vaping war continues to be waged.</p>
