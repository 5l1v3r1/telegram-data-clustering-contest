        <b>Leigh Milner and Chris Berrow review the new version of MediEvil!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chris - First released in 1998. So it's 21 years old now actually athleticism massively improved version from the original but then I never played the original whereas you had sort of do you think.</p>
      <p>Leigh - I think the graphics are the biggest change. I think it's much smoother. I think I can actually see what he looks like is a bit pixilated before it was wasn't it. You know how the old games looked on the PlayStation everything was chipped to bear and you kind of sometimes you look through walls and you think I shouldn't see that no. That's not so. Yeah.</p>
      <p>Chris - The concept for this game is that one of the funniest concepts I've ever heard. So basically you're this hero and he is supposed to defeat is an evil wizard. But the truth is that actually he got shot by an arrow in the eye and died. And if one just pretended that he defeated the big boss. So now that this big boss has returned and revived everybody from the dead it's like Oh right a bear actually defeat the big boss this time because it's my real chance to do that. Let's say a new play is this kind of. Yeah. It is like blessed. You know he's giving his best go. But there's sword combat and stuff. It's actually really good.</p>
