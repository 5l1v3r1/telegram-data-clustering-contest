      <p>The government is expected to launch India’s first fixed income Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in December, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/first-fixed-income-etf-of-bluechip-psus-may-be-launched-next-month-6129475/">reports</a> The Indian Express. The ETF is expected to be sized around Rs 15,000-20,000 crore and will contain debt securities of a dozen state-run companies.</p>
      <p>The fund will include only AAA-rated papers of the public sector units (PSUs). It could offer a return of over seven percent for investors, higher than the 5.5 percent post-tax return offered by most fixed bank deposits.</p>
      <p>The proceeds will go to the PSUs involved in the ETF, unless it also includes government securities and bond papers.</p>
      <p>Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.</p>
      <p>“We already held some roadshows and hope that the debt ETF will be launched by December,” a government official source told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Large central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) will most probably participate in the ETF, the report said.</p>
      <p>There are a few gold and equity traded ETFs in India, but no debt funds, except for two securities based ETF which have not seen much interest from investors.</p>
      <p>The tax rules applicable for debt mutual funds will apply to the debt ETF as well, the report stated.</p>
      <p>In FY19, the government had sold several tranches of ETFs, generating Rs 45,730 crore.</p>
