Equipped with an ultra wide angle 48MP AI-enabled triple camera to deliver outstanding photography, the Huawei Y9s also features a 6.59-inch HD Full-View display and perfectly integrated front-facing pop-up camera for a boundary-free viewing experience.</p>
      <p>With looks to match the outstanding specifications, Y9s’ design is inspired by the concept of ‘time aesthetics’. Available in two styles; ‘Breathing Crystal’ and ‘Midnight Black’ the mobile phone combines nature’s beauty with modern craftsmanship in a stylish design that sets a new standard for entry-level smartphones aesthetics.</p>
      <p>As a new addition to Huawei’s entry-level lineup, the device offers a captivating mix of features and superb performance. With the perfect blend of quality craftsmanship, the Huawei Y9s takes entry-level devices into a new aesthetic era.
