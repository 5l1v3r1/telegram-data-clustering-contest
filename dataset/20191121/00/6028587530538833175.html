      <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-t-lupfer-6bbbb111/">Tim Lupfer,</a> 69, entered West Point at the age of 17 in 1968, and four years later he graduated first in his class. He served in various combat-ready units in the US and Germany, and he attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. He also served as an Assistant Professor at West Point, where he taught military history. In 1990 and 1991, he commanded a tank battalion (over 700 soldiers) in combat in Desert Storm.After retiring from the army in 1992, he entered the business world. Lupfer served as an executive at R.H. Macy and Company while the company emerged from bankruptcy, and then became a management consultant, starting his consulting career with McKinsey. During his 16-year consulting career, Tim worked with a wide variety of organizations. Lupfer is the author of the new book, <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Leadership-Tough-Love-Examining-Leaders-ebook/dp/B07YXHG6N6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=leadership+tough+love&amp;qid=1574299993&amp;sr=8-1"><i>Leadership Tough Love</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Lupfer helped companies from a wide variety of industries in establishing ethics and compliance programs and in developing codes of conduct. He has given numerous presentations on ethics and compliance throughout his consulting career. He retired as a Managing Director at Deloitte Consulting in 2011.</p>
      <p>A baby boomer with a broad, diverse work background, Lupfer has been a mentor to many people leaving the military trying to find their way in the civilian world. He has some crucial advice for those searching for that new job, discussing the world of work they will find and how it compares to military life.  </p>
      <p>"If you are making the transition from your military role, do not listen to anyone who says how easy the transition is – it's NOT," he said. He noted some key observations:   </p>
      <p>o The military is a culture that takes people in at a young age and keeps them there. It is a self-enclosed culture. You will have to break away from this. Almost no business organization is like this at all, so don't look for a mirror of the military.</p>
      <p>o The military takes a long view since it is preparing for the next conflict. Business doesn't do this; business is in constant competition.</p>
      <p>o Therefore, an employer isn't looking so much at your potential – it's looking at what you can deliver right now.</p>
      <p>o The military has an organizational structure that goes back, directly, 400 years, and some aspects are as old as the ancient Roman Empire. Business is nothing like that: positions are often poorly defined, and they change. You have to do a lot of self-defining of your role, and quickly, and be prepared for frequent changes.</p>
      <p>Lupfer continued to offer more job search advice. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Research the new culture</b>. Review companies' websites and read company reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm">Glassdoor.com.</a>  </li>
        <li><b>Evaluate</b> <b>your experience. </b>Translate what you do into what business people will understand. Note the number of people you led and the dollar amount you handled. You may have to do some research and ask some questions to get these answers. This translates to the level of responsibility you have had, and that is something business people understand. </li>
        <li><b>Talk about NOW.</b> A company wants to know what you can contribute to them now. They are not interested in your potential. They want you to articulate precisely how you can lead, how you can handle the supply chain, outline your data analytic skills, and so on. You must show the value you bring right away. </li>
        <li><b>Finalize your new location.</b> The government owes you one relocation, so while on active duty, go on interviews, visit places you may want to settle in. Then make a decision and start job hunting in that specific region. Saying you'll move anywhere is too broad. Fine-tune it to one place or two before you depart, and then you can zero in on jobs in that region. </li>
        <li><b>Show your leadership. </b>Picture the people you are presenting yourself to in an interview or in a resume, as the parents of someone you would lead in the military. You want to come across as a leader they would trust with their children. You have learned to take excellent care of your subordinates. You won't find many people doing this well in the business world, but noting how you are an outstanding manager of people is an excellent way for you to shine. </li>
        <li><b>NETWORK! </b>Talk to people who have made the transition. Make as many contacts as possible. Ask about their transition and a few inquiring questions about their job and what their company is like. This will help educate you more on the world you are entering and allow you to be able to communicate more effectively with business people. You should go to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn.com</a>, set up a profile and search out veterans. </li>
        <li><b>Talk their language in the interview. </b>A lot of military people try to save their leave so they can get paid for it after separating. It's wiser to use some of this time to go to job interviews. You'll need to not talk like you would to fellow soldiers. Don't say "yes sir, yes ma’am" as that isn't how business people converse. Dress as they do. Talk like they talk. Do not use any military jargon or acronyms. Don't say, "I commanded a company" say "I led 100 soldiers." Be careful about discussing combat or warfare experience as the business person is very far removed from this and doesn't want to hear about bombs and killing the enemy.</li>
        <li><b>Lose the military look. </b>Invest in a new suit and business-casual clothing meaning for mean dress slacks, collared button-down shirts with long sleeves, and some nice shoes. Grow your hair out just a bit. You don't want to reinforce the stereotype of military people. Women should buy some conservative dresses and skirts, a business suit, dress pants and sweaters or blouses that aren't see-through. Be sure to have a contemporary hairstyle. And be friendly with a firm handshake and warm smile. It would help if you were engaging, and not quiet. </li>
