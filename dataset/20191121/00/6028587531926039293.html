      <p>David Stearns' <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2018/10/29/brewers-offseason-starts-with-big-decisions/#669e961b5a3d">off-season to-do list</a> just got a little bit longer. The Milwaukee Brewers' president of baseball operations already had a lot on his plate this winter with needs all over the field.But now, he'll also need to find another catcher after Yasmani Grandal agreed to a four-year <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonywitrado/2019/11/21/yasmani-grandals-contract-with-the-white-sox-signals-their-win-now-mentality/#382c1dd81bfc">$73 million deal with the White Sox</a>. Grandal came to Milwaukee in a surprise move a year ago.</p>
      <p>After allegedly spurning a four-year offer from the New York Mets, he instead<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2019/01/09/brewers-agree-to-one-year-deal-with-c-yasmani-grandal/"> inked a one-year deal worth $18.25 million with the Brewers</a> and went on to post career-best numbers in home runs (28) and RBIs (77), while also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2019/06/30/brewers-send-four-all-stars-to-cleveland/#114b794c36af">earning his second career All-Star invitation</a>.</p>
      <p>He also led the Brewers with 153 games played — the most among MLB catchers — and 141 starts while walking over 109 times to finish with a .380 on-base percentage.</p>
      <p>Grandal's contract contained a $16 million mutual option with a $2.25 million buyout for 2020 that he was expected to decline — and did on Oct. 31, putting himself on the open market for a second consecutive winter.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think it’s particularly controversial that I’d love to have both of them back," Stearns said of Grandal and fellow free agent Mike Moustakas at his annual end-of-season press conference. "They are two very good players that fit with our organization and fit with our team very well. Whether the realities of the market permit that and whether the realities of the free agent market permit that is something we will have to evaluate as we go through the off-season.”</p>
      <p>After the deal with the White Sox was announced, Grandal took to Instagram to thank the Brewers and their fans for their support over the last year.</p>
      <p>"You guys took my family and I in with open arms and made it a very special year," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Iq7x-lyCc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Grandal said in his post</a>. "We are grateful for all the love you showed us."</p>
      <p>His absence leaves the Brewers with just three players currently on the roster who batted at or above the league average last season but also creates a glaring void behind the plate where Grandal, long regarded as one of the best pitch-framers in the game, was a valuable asset to Milwaukee's pitching staff.</p>
      <p>For now, veteran Manny Pina is the front-runner heading into spring training. Pina served as Milwaukee’s primary catcher in 2017 and ‘18 but slid into a backup role behind Grandal a year ago and batted .228 with a .724 OPS in 76 appearances.</p>
      <p>Pina, 32, signed a one-year, $1.75 million contract with Milwaukee ahead of the 2019 season that contained a $1.85 million team option for 2020, which the team exercised earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Should the Brewers not find another backstop on the free agent or trade markets, Jacob Nottingham could find himself on the Opening Day roster.</p>
      <p>Acquired from Oakland along with Bubba Derby for Khris Davis in February 2016, Nottingham has gone through a slow but steady development process in the Brewers' farm system. Nottingham ,24, slashed .231/.313/.355 with 5 home runs, 40 RBI and a .668 OPS in 83 games for Triple-A San Antonio last season and went 2-for-6 with a home run and four RBI in nine games with the Brewers.</p>
      <p>If Nottingham doesn't get the nod, Milwaukee could also turn to veteran David Freitas, who the Brewers acquired last April from Seattle.</p>
      <p>Freitas led the Pacific Coast League with a .381 batting average and .461 on-base percentage in 2019 and went 1-for-13 with three walks in 16 pinch-hitting appearances for the Brewers as a September call-up. Since making his debut with the Braves in 2017, Freitas has appeared in 59 MLB games and is a .200 batter with a home run and eight RBI in 143 plate appearances.</p>
