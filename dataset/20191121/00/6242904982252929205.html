        <b>Mukarama Abdulai bagged a brace for Tyler Junior College Apache Ladies in their 3-2 win over Snow (Utah) to secure a semi-final berth in the NJCAA Championship.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ghanaian female star opened the scoring for her side as they coasted to victory.</p>
      <p>The win means Tyler Junior College Apache Ladies are one win away from playing in their fourth straight national soccer championship match.</p>
      <p>The Apache Ladies, seeded No. 3, will play in the noon semifinal against host and No. 2 seed Eastern Florida State (16-0-0) on Friday.</p>
      <p>The other semifinal will pit No. 1 Monroe (New York) (13-0-0) against No. 11 Lewis &amp; Clark (Illinois) (20-3) at 9 a.m. Friday.</p>
      <p>The winners advance to the national championship game that is scheduled for 6 p.m. Saturday.</p>
      <p>Snow tied the game at 2-2 with 11:50 on the clock in the second half but TJC’s Nukarama Abdulai, a 5-8 freshman forward from Tamale, Ghana, scored the go-ahead goal and the eventual game-winner with 9:54 on the scoreboard.</p>
      <p>The victory gave the No. 3 seed Apache Ladies the Pool C championship over No. 10 Seminole State of Oklahoma (1-1) and Snow (0-2).</p>
      <p>Abdulai scored the first goal of the game for a 1-1 tie and Vicki Adams, a 5-3 freshman from Gyongyos, Hungary, gave TJC a 2-1 lead.</p>
      <p>Patricia Estupinan, a sophomore from Spain, had two assists, while Abdulai had an assist.</p>
      <p>Sydney Malmstrom, a sophomore from Whitehouse, was in goal for the Apache Ladies.</p>
      <p>TJC has won six straight games.</p>
      <p>The Apache Ladies have won three national soccer championships — 2009, 2011 and 2017.</p>
