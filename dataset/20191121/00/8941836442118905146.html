      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - As the internet slowly is being revived across <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> after a dayslong, government-imposed shutdown amid demonstrations, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling on Iranians to send the U.S. videos “documenting the regime’s crackdown on protestors.”</p>
      <p>Pompeo’s tweet early Friday comes as pockets of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> saw internet over landlines restored.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “The U.S. will expose and sanction the abuses.”</p>
      <p>Authorities have said the internet may be entirely restored soon, suggesting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s government put down the demonstrations that began Nov. 15 over government-set gasoline prices rising.</p>

        <p>Amnesty International says protest unrest and a subsequent security crackdown killed at least 106 people. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> disputes that figure without offering its own. A U.N. office earlier said it feared the unrest may have killed “a significant number of people.”</p>
