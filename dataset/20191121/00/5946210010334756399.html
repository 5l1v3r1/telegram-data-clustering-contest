      <h1>How Impeachment Played at the Democratic Debate in Atlanta</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/amy-davidson-sorkin" target="_blank">Amy Davidson Sorkin</a></address>
      <p>After a full day of hearings before the Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, the Democratic <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/presidential-debate">Presidential-primary debate</a>, which was held that night, in Atlanta, turned out to be something of a respite from talk of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/impeachment">impeachment</a>. The issue came up—it is both fundamental and unavoidable—but, with few exceptions, only when the candidates were asked. No one mentioned “quid,” or “quo.” Unlike in the previous debate, there were candidates who didn’t get much of a chance to address the issue at all. The reason may have been that, at this point, there are few contrasts between the candidates on the basic question of whether the President should be impeached; the more revealing aspect of the discussion was how the candidates used the issue to point out something else they wanted voters to know.</p>
      <p>The first impeachment question, and the first question over all, went to Senator <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>, of Massachusetts. Rachel Maddow, one of the moderators for MSNBC, which co-sponsored the debate with the Washington <i>Post</i>, gave a quick summary of the day’s big headline: Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, had “buttressed the case” that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">President Trump</a> tried to use the threat of withholding military aid to extract investigations of his political enemies from the Ukrainian government. Maddow noted, though, that Warren didn’t need any buttressing; she had already said that she thinks Trump is guilty. As a senator, Warren will get to cast a vote on that guilt when the proceedings advance, as they almost certainly will, to the trial stage. Maddow asked, “Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And, if so, how?” “Of course I will,” Warren said. “And the obvious answer is to say, first, read the Mueller report, all four hundred and forty-two pages of it.”</p>
      <p>That is not, in fact, a very obvious answer for persuading Republicans, who have touted the Mueller report as an exoneration. But it did serve to establish that Warren is no impeachment latecomer, which was, perhaps, more the point she wanted to make. She added that it is basically a matter of principle, and then said that she wanted to focus on a different aspect of the day’s testimony: “How did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: he wrote a check for a million dollars.” (Sondland is a hotelier; he noted in his testimony that the million dollars paid for a “V.V.I.P. ticket” to Trump’s Inauguration, and he agreed, with a smile, that it was “a lot of money.”) Warren said that she had taken a pledge not to accede to requests from big donors for ambassadorships, adding, “I asked everyone who’s running for President to join me in that, and not a single person has so far.” She managed, in what is becoming the Warrenesque fashion, to turn a question about how to reach out to Republicans into a dig at fellow-Democrats.</p>
      <p>Maddow turned next to Senator <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/amy-klobuchar">Amy Klobuchar</a>, of Minnesota, who, like Warren and three other candidates—Senators <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cory-booker">Cory Booker</a>, of New Jersey, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>, of California, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>, of Vermont—would serve as an impeachment-trial juror. Maddow noted that Klobuchar had previously said that she would wait to hear the trial evidence before saying whether she would convict. “After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?” Maddow asked. “I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct, and I’ve called for an impeachment proceeding,” Klobuchar said. “I just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count and make a decision.” That answer spoke to how the senator has tried to present herself: principled, reasonable, and tough without wanting to tear the process apart. Klobuchar then noted what <i>she</i> thought the proceedings were really about: “Our democracy at stake.” Trump, she said, had put his private and partisan interests ahead of the country’s; instead of getting into the Ukraine details, she pointed to “a pattern” that includes not only “sucking up to Vladimir Putin” but failing to support American farmers and the Kurds. She closed her impeachment answer with former Vice-President (and onetime Minnesota Senator) Walter Mondale’s assessment of his time in office, a statement quoted on a wall in the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum, in Atlanta—“We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace”—a neat connection between her home state and the evening’s host city, but also another assertion of Midwestern centeredness.</p>
      <p>This was a strong debate for Klobuchar, who made droll comments about campaign finance (for her first campaign, she called everyone she knew and “set what is still an all-time Senate record. I raised seventeen thousand dollars from ex-boyfriends”) and about the obviousness of the truth that women are held to a higher standard than men (“Otherwise, we could play a game called Name Your Favorite Woman President”). She also confronted Mayor <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a>, of South Bend, Indiana, about his lack of experience in a way that was effective but not, in any sense, cheap. (He said that he supported proposed legislation regarding voter suppression and gerrymandering; she pointed out that she had been the one “leading eleven of the bills” he referred to.) The same could be said about Buttigieg’s response to her, in which he offered a definition of experience that went beyond political office, and of an earlier answer to Harris, who had been prompted by moderators to address the question of his appeal to minority voters. (Buttigieg, because of his surge in Iowa and New Hampshire polls, was the evening’s predictable target.) Harris had talked about the importance of real, long-standing community connections; Buttigieg said that he wanted to talk to voters about what was “in my heart,” which led into a well-wrought, delicate statement of how both his faith and his experience as a gay man had prepared him to, as he put it, realize “just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.” Somehow, all three of them came out of the exchanges looking better. (The same cannot be said of Representative <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/tulsi-gabbard">Tulsi Gabbard</a>, of Hawaii, who tried to portray Buttigieg as a warmonger lacking in courage, and misfired badly.)</p>
      <p>Maddow, after her impeachment question to Klobuchar, turned to Sanders, and asked how “central” impeachment would be to his campaign. “Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a President who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt President in the modern history of America,” Sanders replied. But he warned that being “consumed” by Trump meant losing the election. Luckily, he said, “the Congress can walk and chew bubble gum at the same time.” The walking, presumably, had to do with securing health care for Americans and fighting the corruption of the political system by billionaires, two subjects he addressed. Buttigieg, who got the same question, had a similar answer, adding in the threats of climate change and gun violence. He said that he was focussed on the “tender moment” in the life of the country when Trump would no longer be President. For both Buttigieg and Sanders, Trump was already chewed-up bubble gum.</p>
      <p>Politicians, in debates, like to say that something is “personal” for them; the next impeachment question, from Maddow’s colleague Andrea Mitchell, to former Vice-President <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>, was, as Buttigieg might say, tender in that respect. She noted that, in the course of the hearings, Republicans were calling for investigations “not only of you but also of your son.” (Mitchell did not name Biden’s son, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/hunter-biden">Hunter</a>, or get into the allegations, which involve Hunter’s well-paid presence on the board of a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma; neither did any of the other candidates. Both Bidens deny any wrongdoing.) Mitchell continued, “How would you get those same Republicans to work with you?” Biden replied that he was the candidate who could both defeat Trump and help to gain House and Senate seats in purple and even red states. He said that two things he had learned from the impeachment proceedings were that “Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee” and “Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be President.” But that response didn’t really resolve the dilemma that Mitchell posed: Biden’s appeal, for many moderate voters, is his capacity for bipartisanship, and yet his family has become something of a linchpin in a very partisan fight.</p>
      <p>Harris was next, with a more open-ended query—“Your thoughts about that?”—and she spoke forcefully about Sondland providing evidence of “a criminal enterprise engaged in by the President,” in which Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney were also implicated. (Each has disputed Sondland’s account.) But what it meant, she said, was that “there are clearly two different sets of rules for two different groups of people in America”—the powerful and everybody else. She then spoke about people being hit with penalties for late credit-card payments and being sent to jail for shoplifting. She said that she was campaigning for justice.</p>
      <p>With that, Mitchell ended the opening line of impeachment questioning, and went back to Warren with a question about divisions in the country. Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, both businessmen, had not spoken yet, and neither, at that point, had Booker or Gabbard, and none of them were ever asked directly about impeachment. They did have openings to address it—for example, when questions about Russia and the integrity of the electoral process came up—that they didn’t quite take up, although Yang said that, after winning, in his first call to Vladimir Putin, he’d tell the Russian President, “I’m sorry I beat your guy.” Yang and Booker both had very good nights, and Steyer had a decent one. And the directions they went in were often valuable. Yang, in his answer on Putin, went on to mention China’s treatment of minorities, a reference to the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/uighurs">Uighurs</a>—a subject that Biden also brought up—and the need for “a new world data organization.” Booker, in response to a question on China, talked about the use of U.S. military assets “to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children,” and the need for congressional action on that issue.</p>
      <p>There were some further references to impeachment, later in the debate, including in Klobuchar’s closing statement. (She praised the courage of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/attacked-by-republicans-alexander-vindman-testifies-to-the-power-of-truth">Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman</a>, one of the witnesses at this week’s hearings.) The most extended one came in a back-and-forth between Sanders and Biden, after Maddow asked Sanders about the chants of “Lock him up!” that were directed at Trump at a World Series game. This was a play on the Trump-rally “Lock her up!” chant, which also speaks to the impulse behind Trump’s Ukraine dealings: demand investigations of your opponents. Should such calls be discouraged, or was Sanders “O.K. with it”? Sanders said that the American people are “catching on”: Trump thinks that he is above the law, and he isn’t. Biden, whom Maddow turned to next, cautioned that Democrats should not “model ourselves after Trump.” He called for civility. But he added that, when Trump’s Presidency ends, a new Attorney General will be free, in a way that is independent of the White House’s directions and political needs, to launch criminal investigations.</p>
      <p>“I think Joe is right, that is the function of an independent Department of Justice,” Sanders said. “But my inclination is that the American people do believe that this President is in violation of the law.” That might not be enough in a Senate trial. But perhaps it will be when those Americans cast their votes, next November.</p>
