      <p>Takealot’s 2019 Blue Dot Sale take place from 29 November to 3 December and will offer big discounts on technology products, TVs, appliances, toys, and gaming products.</p>

      <h3>Early Access deals</h3>
      <p>In the build-up to its Blue Dot Sale, Takealot is holding an Early Access Sale which will run from 24-28 November.</p>
      <p>Takealot said this Early Access Blue Dot Sale will feature “excellent deals” which will not be beaten over the Black Friday period.</p>

      <h3>Big growth expected</h3>
      <p>Takealot CEO Kim Reid told MyBroadband they expect Black Friday 2019 revenue to increase by 80% compared to 2018.</p>
      <p>Takealot made R196 million on Black Friday 2018, and the retailer hopes to reach around R353 million in revenue this year.</p>
      <p>In 2018, simultaneous active users peaked between 70,000 and 100,000 on Takealot’s website during Black Friday, and Reid said they expect traffic to increase by 120% this year.</p>
      <p>Reid added that the company has taken steps to reduce the possibility of service interruptions and issues with online payments.</p>
      <p>It expects to ship at least one order every second, with roughly 10,000 boxes leaving their warehouses every hour over the shopping season.</p>
      <p>To facilitate the large number of customers, Takealot will grow its call centre staff complement from 380 to 750 for Black Friday 2019.</p>
