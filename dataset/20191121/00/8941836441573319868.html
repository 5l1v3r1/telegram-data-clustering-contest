      <p>DALLAS (AP) - Jamie Benn backhanded a tiebreaking goal with 4:21 left and the rolling <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Dallas Stars</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a> Jets 5-3 Thursday night after blowing a three-goal lead.</p>
      <p>Mattias Janmark returned from injury to score the first of three <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> goals in the second period, all assisted by Corey Perry.</p>
      <p>Patrik Laine got his 17th goal in 15 games against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a>, and Luca Sbisa tied it with 4:46 left in the third.</p>
      <p>Benn scored 25 seconds later, skating across the slot and slipping a shot into the right side of the net. He has four of his five goals this season in the last three games. Tyler Seguin added an empty-netter with 35 seconds to play.</p>
      <p>In a game between two of the NHL’s hottest teams, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> won their fifth straight to go to 12-1-1 in the last 14 games and move ahead of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a> for third place in the Central Division. The Jets had won 5 of 6 and five in a row on the road.</p>

      <p>Ben Bishop made 23 saves in his sixth straight win. The Jets’ Connor Hellebuyck stopped 31 shots.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a> failed to connect during an extended power-play chance in the first. The Jets controlled the puck for more than a minute following a tripping penalty by Andrew Cogliano and got three shots on goal before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> could force a whistle. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a> had no shots during the 2-minute power play.</p>
      <p>Janmark scored at 7:37 of the second period. Perry dropped the puck back to Andrej Sekera at the right point. Hellebuyck made a pad save on Sekera’s shot, but the rebound went to Janmark for a wrist shot.</p>
      <p>Dickinson gave the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> a 2-0 lead at 9:43 when he tipped Taylor Fedun’s shot from the blue line over Hellebuyck’s left shoulder. The Jets challenged, claiming the play was offside, but the video replay upheld the goal.</p>

        <p>Faksa’s shot from the right faceoff dot popped into the air in front of the net and the puck was knocked across the goal line at 13:19.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a>’s first goal came 39 seconds later, when Connor put a wrist shot past Bishop.</p>
        <p>NOTES: Janmark missed four games because of a lower-body injury. … Faksa has an eight-game point streak. … Perry has a goal and four assists in the last two games, and two three-point games this season. His three assists were his most since he had four for Anaheim at Toronto Feb. 5, 2018. … Winnipeg C Mark Scheifele, who assisted on Connor’s goal, has 31 points in 27 games vs. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a>.</p>
