      <h1>Little Flash Charges In 40 Seconds Thanks To Super Capacitors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/dammitcoetzee/" target="_blank">Gerrit Coetzee</a></address>
      <p>We’ve all committed the sin of making a little arduino robot and running it off AA batteries. <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/165604-little-flash">Little Flash is better than that</a> and runs off three 350 F capacitors.</p>
      <p>In fact, that’s the entire mission of the robot. [Mike Rigsby] wants people to know there’s a better way. What’s really cool is that 10 A for 40 seconds lets the robot run for over 25 minutes!</p>
      <p>The robot itself is really simple. The case is 3D printed with an <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/09/27/line-follower-with-no-arduino/">eye towards simplicity.</a> The brains are an Arduino nano and the primary input is a bump sensor. The robot runs around randomly, but avoids getting stuck with the classic reverse-and-turn on collision.</p>
      <p>It’s cool to see how far these capacitors have come. We remember people wondering about these high priced specialty parts when they first dropped on the hobby scene, but they’re becoming more and more prevalent compared to other solutions such as coin-cells and solder tab lithium batteries for PCB power solutions.</p>
