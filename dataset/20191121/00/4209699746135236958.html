      <p>A sales attendant, Ekuyik-Ebitu Warri, has been docked at a Magistrate Court sitting in Akure, Ondo State, for allegedly stealing goods worth N1m.</p>
      <p>Warri was arraigned before the court after she was accused of stealing the property of Golden Tripod International LTD where she worked.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old lady was dragged before Chief Magistrate Charity Adeyanju on one count charge of stealing.</p>
      <p>She committed the offence on October 22, 2019 at about 10:00am at New Station Road Akure, according to the police.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor of the case, Mr Uloh Goodluck, told the court that there were four witnesses ready to testify in the case.</p>
      <p>He, however, pleaded with the Magistrate Adeyanju to give him time to assemble all of them and asked for an adjournment.</p>
      <p>Although, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the offence.</p>
      <p>In her judgement, Mrs Adeyanju granted the defendant a bail in sum of N1.5m and one surety in like sum.</p>
      <p>She asked that the surety must be a resident in the jurisdiction and provide the evidence of tax payment for this current year.</p>
      <p>She later adjourned the case to January 15, 2020 for hearing.</p>
