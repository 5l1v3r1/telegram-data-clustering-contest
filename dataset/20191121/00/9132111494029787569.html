      <p>CEO for GIHOC distilleries Maxwell Kofi Jumah has lambasted the minority in parliament, describing the opposition party as a slogan hitting party.</p>
      <p>According to him, the group on the left side in parliament can’t stand up to any in-depth discussion.</p>
      <p>Mr Jumah who was on the Starr Chat with Bola Ray Wednesday said “the minority has not been effective, they are a slogan hitting party. The minority is just making noise and can’t stand up to any in-depth discussion.”</p>
      <p>The former MP for Asokwa said however that Ghana’s parliament has institutional challenges that must be fixed especially owing to the fact that MP’s can’t execute a bill.</p>
      <p>He praised Majority Leader Osei Kyei Mensah-Bonsu for doing ‘his best’ as a majority leader.</p>
      <p>Mr Jumah has also declared a ‘yes’ vote for the upcoming December 15 referendum.</p>
