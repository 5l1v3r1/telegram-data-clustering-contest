      </p>
      <p>This is in response to Minister for Defence and National Security, Inia Seruiratu who said in parliament that SODELPA members should ask Rabuka to step down as it will benefit the party and the nation.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Seruiratu also claimed in parliament that there is a lot of apprehension and fear in our communities and in the business community as well because of Rabuka's return to parliament.</p>
      <p>Bulitavu says Seruiratu’s antics were a cheap attempt to shift the focus in the face of the devastating incompetence of the FijiFirst Government in its thirteenth year in office.</p>
      <p>He says Seruiratu failed to explain to the nation the cause of the rapidly deteriorating law and order situation in the country.</p>
      <p>Bulitavu says the fact that the Minister for Defence volunteered to join the military when Rabuka was the Commander is a clear indication that he supported the Leader of Opposition’s actions in 1987.</p>
      <p>He says Seruiratu cannot hide from the fact that the RFMF consolidated the new Republic established in 1987.</p>

      <p>Bulitavu further says Seruiratu was a senior officer in the RFMF when the events of May 2000 took place, and again in December 2006.</p>
      <p>He says SODELPA will not shy away from its duty to hold the FijiFirst Government to account and present alternative policies and programmes.</p>
      <p>Bulitavu says Seruiratu should also inform the nation that he was Agriculture Minister when Grace Road Church established itself in Fiji in 2014.</p>
      <p>He says  SODELPA remains steadfast in its call for the Prime Minister and Fiji Government to resign and allow the President to call fresh elections.</p>
