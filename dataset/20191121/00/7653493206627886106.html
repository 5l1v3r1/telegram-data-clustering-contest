      <p>It offers several improved features from its predecessor, including 50% more battery life; a smaller, more secure, comfortable fit; 4-microphone call technology; and enhanced noise and wind reducing algorithms.</p>
      <p>Specifically designed to provide enhanced comfort through its optimal earbud shape and size, the earbuds have been extensively tested for secure fit, so users can be confident that the buds will stay put, regardless of the activity they are engaging in.</p>
      <p>The Elite 75t offers 28 hours of battery life with the charging case and 7.5 hours without, and also comes with fast USB-C charging. A wireless charging variant is expected to be introduced to the market at a later date.</p>
