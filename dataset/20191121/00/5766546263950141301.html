      <p><b>Monrovia – </b>Mighty Barrolle alias the ‘Rollers’ is expected to play in the First Division stage of Liberia Football Association (LFA) 2019/2020 national league after spending three years in the Second Division.</p>
      <p>Barrolle, through the intervention of her current president, Mr. Alex Tyler, bought Barrack Young Controllers (BYC) space for the team but a former defender of former LFA second division side Exodus FC had voiced that for the team to play good football against her opponents in the LFA upcoming national league, she needs to buy more skillful players.</p>
      <p>It can be recalled that Barrolle ended the LFA 2018/2019 national league at fourth position in the second division table but her new president has vowed to bring the team back among the best playing teams in Liberian football.</p>
      <p>Moses Z. Jackson highlighted that Mighty Barrole is one of the most successful teams in Liberian football but for the past seven years, it had failed to perform to expectation against her opponents especially in the second division stage of the LFA national league where it spent more times all because the leadership at the time failed to buy skillful players.</p>

      <p>It can be recalled that in September 2019, a new leadership headed by former Speaker Alex Tyler as president took over the leadership of Barrolle and vowed to bring back the teams among the best play teams in Liberian football.</p>
      <p>But for Mr. Tyler’s dream to come to reality, Jackson wants for the team’s leadership to sign more skillful players, sign a qualified coaching staff and also provide quality sporting equipment with good salary for the players. He further stated that any team that has an experienced coach, skillful players, and quality sporting equipment with good salary for the players, those players will always battle to deliver the necessary result for their team against their opponents.</p>
      <p>Says Jackson: “Barrolle’s failure to deliver the necessary result for its fans and sympathizers against her opponents for the past seven years was caused by the team’s past leadership’s failure to buy skillful players, sign qualify coach and also provide quality sporting equipment with good salary for the players but if Mr. Tyler leadership can listen to the call of football analysts and buy experienced players, sign qualified coach and also provide quality sporting equipment with good salary for the players the team would be able to finish the league among the first three or four teams.”</p>
      <p>Mighty Barrolle and Invincible Eleven (IE) are the two most successful teams in Liberian football but for the past seven years, they have not been performing well against their opponents which led to their relegation to the LFA second division and also the relegation of IE to third division stage where she still stands.</p>
