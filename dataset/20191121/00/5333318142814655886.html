      <h1>Stockholm has the smarts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.innovatorsmag.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Staff reporter</a></address>
      <p>Sweden’s capital was named the world’s smartest city at the Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona this week. Stockholm won the accolade, in a large part, for its leadership of <a href="http://www.grow-smarter.eu/home/">GrowSmarter</a>, Europe’s leading smart cities project.</p>
      <p>GrowSmarter ‘brings together cities and industry to integrate and demonstrate ‘12 smart city solutions’ in energy, infrastructure and transport, to provide other cities with valuable insights on how they work in practice and opportunities for replication’. The goal is to build a market for these solutions to facilitate the transition to a smarter, sustainable continent.</p>
      <blockquote>“Stockholm is proof of what a connected, smart and sustainable city is. Winning the World Smart City Award is a testament to the huge journey we have been on both in the GrowSmarter project and in the City as a whole. That journey is never ending, but GrowSmarter has taken us an important step on the way,” project managers in the City of Stockholm Sigrid Granström and Lisa Enarsson said.</blockquote>
