        <p>STREAKS, STATS AND NOTES - Matchup of teams involved in one of most influential games in NFL history 51 years ago. Jets held 32-29 lead late in game when NBC switched to show film “Heidi” - and Raiders rallied to win 43-32 while irate TV viewers wondered what happened to game. … Raiders coming off having swept three-game homestand for first time since 1980. … Oakland held Cincinnati to 10 points last week, matching fewest points allowed in game in past six seasons. … Raiders’ last road win vs. Jets came in 1996. Oakland lost last six games at Meadowlands complex since beating Giants 28-10 on Nov. 25, 2001. … Raiders have most yards from scrimmage (1,676), TDs (14), yards rushing (937), receptions (73), sacks (10) from rookie class. … Oakland is first team since sacks became official stat in 1982 to get at least 10 TDs, 10 sacks from rookies in first 10 games of season. … Oakland QB Derek Carr leads NFL with 9.2 yards per attempts in past six weeks. … Rookie RB Josh Jacobs’ 1,067 yards from scrimmage are ninth most for Raiders player through 10 games. … Oakland DE Maxx Crosby became fourth rookie to get four sacks in game last week, joining Leslie O’Neal (five in 1986), Cornelius Bennett (1987) and Brian Orakpo (2009). … Raiders made at least five sacks in consecutive games for first time since 2011. … Oakland allowed 73 net yards passing last week, fewest in game since Nov. 9, 2008, when Carolina had 57 in 17-6 win vs. Raiders. … Jets looking for first three-game winning streak since Weeks 3-5 of 2017 season. … Jets averaging nearly 29 points and 338 yards while going 2-1 - including consecutive wins over Giants and Redskins - in last three games. … QB Sam Darnold has completed 65.7% of passes with six touchdowns and two interceptions during stretch. … Jets have scored TD on opening possession in four straight games. That comes after New York had gone 30 consecutive games without getting into end zone on first drive. … In win at Washington last Sunday, Darnold became youngest player in Jets history to throw four TD passes in game; Joe Namath was nine days older when he did it in 1965. … RB Le’Veon Bell averaging career-low 3.2 yards per carry and hasn’t cracked 100 yards in any game this season. … Despite Bell’s struggles, New York totaled 115 yards rushing against Washington, first time it went over 100 as team. … TE Ryan Griffin had five catches for 109 yards - first 100-yard game of career - and TD at Washington. He has 25 receptions for 269 yards and career-high four TDs while becoming reliable target for Darnold. … S Jamal Adams had three sacks vs. Redskins and two previous week vs. Giants. His six sacks are already franchise’s single-season record for defensive backs. Adams needs two to tie Arizona’s Adrian Wilson (2005) for most by DB in one season in NFL history. … New York allowing league-low 79.1 yards rushing per game after holding Washington to 54. Jets have allowed one 100-yard rusher: Dallas’ Ezekiel Elliott, who had 105 on 28 carries in Week 6. … Opponents averaging league-low 2.98 yards per carry vs. New York. … Fantasy Tip: Could be tough sledding for Jacobs vs. Jets’ stout run D, but WR Hunter Renfrow might be solid start vs. New York’s suspect secondary. Renfrow becoming more involved in passing game lately, with 15 catches on 18 targets in last three games for 162 yards and one TD.</p>
