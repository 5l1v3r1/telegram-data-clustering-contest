        <b>CBD has caught the public's imagination as an ingredient offering a host of potential health benefits. But for all the hype, CBD also courts controversy. To move from a trending ingredient to an ingredient trend, the sector will need to address some significant challenges.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In our new <a href="https://www.cbd-global-summit.com/?utm_source=FNE&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=launch"><b>CBD Global Summit</b>​</a>​, in partnership with our sister publications NutraIngredients, CosmeticsDesign and The Grocer, FoodNavigator will profile the pioneering brands, cutting-edge science, regulatory know-how and consumer insight that businesses need in order to capitalise on the cannabidiol (CBD) opportunity.</p>
      <p>The two-day event, held in London’s Park Plaza Victoria hotel on 16-17 March 2020, will bring together key themes linking the consumer demand and innovation that is propelling CBD, to the tough questions around science, supply and legality.</p>
      <p>Specialist speakers and panellists will weigh in to discuss the role CBD can play across the food, drink, nutra and beauty aisles.</p>
      <p>Experts from disciplines including food and drink, health and beauty, retail, pharma, medical science and biotech will probe the business, science and regulation around CBD.</p>
      <anchor name="eztoc_1_1_1">
        <h3>Key themes for the 2020 event will include:</h3>
        <p><b>Consumers &amp; Markets:</b>​ A consumer-centric approach to innovation will be crucial to support future growth in CBD. What is motivating the CBD consumer? What do shoppers want from the category? And how can innovators meet these needs?</p>
        <p><b>Retailers &amp; Brands:</b>​ What approaches are top retailers taking to CBD ranging? How are trailblazing brands driving growth in the area? We’ll profile the most exciting disruptors delivering products with a unique positioning around CBD.</p>
        <p><b>Regulation:</b>​ The biggest headache in 2020 for manufacturers working in CBD will be navigating a challenging regulatory environment. Unlike hemp – which is legal in the EU and other markets – the legal status of products containing CBD is far from clear. To succeed in the sector, manufacturers must consider the risks and opportunities presented by this difficult landscape.</p>
        <p><b>The Science Behind CBD:</b>​ CBD has been associated with various health benefits, resulting in it being hailed as something of a ‘wonder drug’. But for all the hype, much of the research into CBD’s impact on health is still in its early stages. It is vital that claims linked to CBD products remain credible if the category is to maintain consumer trust. We look at the science behind CBD to ask exactly what claims stack up.</p>
        <p><b>Safety &amp; Quality:</b>​ Booming demand for CBD products presents manufacturers with challenges around quality of supply. The need to deliver traceable and safe products is paramount. A significant health or safety scare has the potential to stop the high-growth but fledgling CBD sector in its tracks. We will hear top tips from industry experts about how CBD manufacturers can shore up their supply chains and guarantee high quality finished products.</p>
        <p>The full agenda will be available online shortly.
