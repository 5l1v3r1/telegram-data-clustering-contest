      <p>Leigh - Okay so in someone's office it's like my old bedroom gets my e-mails email. Yeah. Cause like being back at work. Thanks for taking over the P.C. shop for me. Sorry it's not the best day. Few things come in. Companies aren't doing very well. There's no money in the bank account. The rents and energy bill. Is this you sent this so these emails are going very badly for this company. I had the job and the guy we should help with the rent see email below. Flip it back is like being at work. Got to pick up a parcel. Well I don't want that I don't want to read it. I want to blow something up or raise something I'm currently picking up a parcel I'm walking round an office block.</p>
      <p>Chris - You're on minus 15 dollars. You need this job. I've done my best effort. Did you need the computer. Lee Milner. Is going to go down the path of paper to a kitten and the puppy and I plugged it in and turned it on.</p>
      <p>Leigh - Well let's say you are if you help me out in the shop I'll give you 10 percent. If I ever get bored of journalism or presenting I will definitely give PC Building Simulator a go!</p>
