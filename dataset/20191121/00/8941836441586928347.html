        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>If anything concrete has come from the Democrat-fueled impeachment hearings being spearheaded by House Intelligence Chairman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-schiff/">Adam Schiff</a>, it’s this: Witnesses acknowledge Hunter Biden’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma Holdings</a>‘ post came in at “less than comfortable” on the old ethics scale.</p>
      <p>So why isn’t Capitol Hill and the media more focused on this as an investigation?</p>
      <p>“Impeachment witnesses suggest <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hunter-bidens-burisma-holdings/">Hunter Biden</a>’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> ties could be conflict of interest,” The New York Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/impeachment-witnesses-suggest-hunter-bidens-ukraine-ties-could-be-conflict-of-interest/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Ya think?</p>
      <p>And yet: There’s a double standard being played here.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>On Biden, where the quid pro quo intent was obvious — where Joe Biden actually bragged about threatening to hold up $1 billion in U.S. aid to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> unless then-President Petro Poroshenko fired a prosecutor who was investigating, in part, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma Holdings</a>, where <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hunter-bidens-burisma-holdings/">Hunter</a> <a href="https://www.voanews.com/europe/ukraine-urges-wests-support-reform-it-seeks-stolen-billions">served</a> as a board member — it’s all conspiracy theory and tin hat crazy to suggest anything nefarious, to call for deeper scrutiny. Biden, we’re told, was simply rooting out corruption, taking a tough-guy approach, and after all, that’s what a good vice president who loves his country should do. Right?</p>
      <p>But on President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>, where a quid pro quo with newly elected <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> President Volodymyr Zelensky is alleged but denied and unproven — it’s impeach, impeach, impeach. It’s automatically assumed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>, by simply <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Unclassified09.2019.pdf">referencing</a> “Biden’s son” in a July 25 telephone call to Zelensky, was making a not-so-veiled threat to tie U.S. aid for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> to an investigation of Hunter Biden’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma</a> dealings, and of Joe Biden’s influence in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>. It’s automatically alleged that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> was using his presidential position as a platform to bribe, for political gain.</p>
      <p>Why the different standards when the allegations are so similar?</p>
      <p>It makes one wonder: How come a quid pro quo is automatically seen as commendable in a Democrat, but nefarious in a Republican?</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The trail of red flags that the Bidens and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma</a> leave is so, so, so much longer than the one <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> leaves, after all.</p>
        <p>Here are the pertinent bullet points about the Bidens: In 2002, Mykola Zlochevsky <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hunter-biden-ukraine/what-hunter-biden-did-on-the-board-of-ukrainian-energy-company-burisma-idUSKBN1WX1P7">co-founded</a> the oil and natural gas company, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma Holdings</a>, located in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> but registered in the well-known tax haven of Cyprus. Red flag number one.</p>
        <p>During the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, and while still <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/04/766579412/what-to-know-about-the-ukrainian-company-at-the-heart-of-trumps-biden-allegation">owning</a> <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma</a>, Zlochevsky also served as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s minister of natural resources — a conflict of interest in itself. Red flag number two.</p>
        <p>In 2014, amid accusations of money laundering and questions about shady-looking gas drilling permit sales, and amid a chaotic national uprising and economic crumbling, he was forced to flee <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>. Red flag number three.</p>
        <p>Enter Hunter Biden, joining <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma</a> as a board member — as a board member who’s paid $50,000 a month, according to the Wall Street Journal. Over the next couple years, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma</a> and Zlochevsky faced more scrutiny and investigations, in part by a prosecutor general named Viktor Shokin. Over these same years, image be <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/hunter-biden-served-as-ceremonial-figure-on-burisma-board-for-80000-per-month/">danged</a>, Hunter Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/13/20912336/hunter-biden-resigns-chinese-firm-impeachment-inquiry-joe-trump">maintained</a> his board position. Red flag number four.</p>
        <p>Now enter Joe Biden, circa 2016.</p>
        <p>That’s when he pressured <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> to oust Shokin as an investigator into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma</a> corruption. How? By threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees.</p>
        <p>Biden, recalling his conversation to Poroshenko before a Council on Foreign Relations audience in January, 2018, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/11/donald-trump/trump-ad-misleads-about-biden-ukraine-and-prosecut/">said</a> this: “I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor [Shokin] is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ “</p>
        <p>And guess what?</p>
        <p>“Well, son of a bitch,” Biden <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/09/27/flashback_2018_joe_biden_brags_at_cfr_meeting_about_withholding_aid_to_ukraine_to_force_firing_of_prosecutor.html">said</a>, during this 2018 CFR talk, “he got fired.”</p>
        <p>Zlochevsky, meanwhile, returned to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> in 2018, free and clear of any charges.</p>
        <p>Whether Shokin, who was <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/11/donald-trump/trump-ad-misleads-about-biden-ukraine-and-prosecut/">alleged</a> to have been corrupt, deserved to be fired or not is not the deeper point. The deeper point is this: Hunter Biden didn’t resign his <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma</a> board position until 2019.</p>
        <p>And when he did resign, it was to save his campaigning father political face. It wasn’t because of concerns about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> corruption. That just begs the question: Why would Hunter want to associate with such a known corrupt entity — and for so many years? </p>
        <p>“Transparency International’s most recent Corruption Perceptions Index ranks <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> 120th out of 182 countries, making it the second most corrupt country in Europe after Russia,” National Interest <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/ukraine-one-world%E2%80%99s-most-corrupt-countries-49712">reported</a> in March. “Similarly, a recent Freedom House survey assesses the level of corruption in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> today as only slightly better than at the height of the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, who was toppled four years ago in the Maidan revolution.”</p>
        <p>Add to that a 2014 conference in Britain where talk centered on recovering money embezzled from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> — and the freezing of millions of dollars in one of Zlochevsky’s accounts — along with a 2017 conference, again in Britain, where Poroshenko begged for help in combating his country’s corruption, and it’s clear: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s reputation for corruption is well-known.</p>
        <p>It’s not as if Hunter Biden could plead ignorance.</p>
        <p>It matters for various reasons, but mostly because we’re now watching an impeachment hunt orchestrated by the Democrats against a president who’s accused of doing something one of their own has actually bragged about doing — yet they’re turning blind eyes to their own. </p>
        <p>Turning blind eyes — even while admitting there’s certainly something to see there.</p>
        <p>“Impeachment witnesses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yShDnDlS0RE">concede</a> Hunter Biden’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma</a> role raised ‘conflict’ concerns, after [Rep. Elise] Stefanik grilling,” Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-witnesses-say-hunter-bidens-burisma-role-raised-conflict-concerns-under-stefanik-grilling">reported</a>.</p>
        <p>Concede, yes. Pursue? No. Not now, not during the impeachment inquiry.</p>
        <p>It’s true, multiple investigations have cleared Zlochevsky and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma-holdings/">Burisma</a> of any wrongdoing (minus some tax paybacks, that is). Same with both Bidens; they’ve committed no wrongdoing that has brought them trouble with the law. But questions linger for a reason. Perception matters. Democrats themselves know that; they’re pinning their whole impeachment hopes on selling perceptions against this president, for crying out loud.</p>
        <p>And that’s what’s most maddening about this whole <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> mess. What’s good for the goose certainly isn’t being seen as good for the gander.</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-schiff/">Adam Schiff</a> refuses to allow this committee to call Hunter Biden,” Stefanik <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/stefanik-constituents-concerned-hunter-biden-burisma">said</a>, on Capitol Hill this week.</p>
        <p>On the one side: a long, long trail of big money, big corruption, big chaos, big investigations and the Bidens — and nothing to see here, folks, go home. On the other, a telephone call, a transcript and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> — and it’s impeach, impeach, impeach.</p>
        <p>At best, it’s a missed story. At worst, it’s a coverup of one, hatchet job of another. Either way, it’s a double standard — and the American people deserve better. If what the Bidens did in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> is no cause for alarm, then what <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> said during his July 25 call with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s president is no cause for alarm. The left can’t have it both ways.</p>
