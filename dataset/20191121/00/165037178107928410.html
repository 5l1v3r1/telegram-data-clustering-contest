        <b>In an interview to 'FOX Sports', Wesley Sneijder made a controversial comment regarding his talents, claiming he "could have been like Cristiano or Messi", but his commitment to football just wasn't at the 100% that level requires.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I have to be honest and admit that I could have been mentioned in the same breath as <b>Messi and Ronaldo</b> if I had been 100% committed. I know that,” Sneijder told Fox Sports NL.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman's words have caused a strong reaction in the media, a few months later after the player announced he is <b>hanging up his boot at 35 years old.</b> </p>
      <p>The player says he has no regrets: "I did not want to do that and I have no regrets about it. It’s not that I didn’t have it in me, but I simply didn’t want to do it."</p>

      <p>“I <b>enjoyed my footballing career as it was</b>, both on and off the pitch. I won every trophy I could win at club level, so I have no regrets at all. I am a team player and I like to be successful as a team."</p>
      <p>When asked about his individual awards, he also claims to not look back on it. “People still approach me to tell me that <b>they feel I should have won the Ballon d’Or in 2010,</b> but I keep telling them that winning the Champions League was nicer than an individual trophy. Of course, it would have been the icing on the cake, but it’s <b>satisfying enough that people tell me I should have won it</b>.”</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old was also asked about who he thinks was the best player he even shared a pitch with, choosing his former Real Madrid teammate <b>Guti</b>.</p>
      <p>“Best player I ever played with? Then I choose Guti,” he said. “<b>He impressed me the most</b>. Me and Guti found each other blindly on the pitch, that man was phenomenal. Of course I played with lots of big players but he impressed me the most.”</p>
