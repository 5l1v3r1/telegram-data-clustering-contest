      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Faderera Falade</a></address>
      <p>A Certificate of Return has been presented by the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/inec/"><u><b>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)</b></u></a> to the Bayelsa State Governor-Elect, Chief <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/david-lyon/"><u>David Lyon.</u></a></b></p>
      <p>Recall that in the gubernatorial election, which took place last Saturday, Lyon of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/apc/"><u><b>All Progressives Congress (APC)</b></u></a> defeated 44 candidates including the candidate of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/pdp/"><u><b>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</b></u></a>, Senator Douye Diri, to win a keenly contested election.</p>
      <p>A certificate of return was also presented to Charles Daniel, a member of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly representing Brass Constituency 1, whose supplementary election was concluded on November 16.</p>
      <p>The State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Pastor Monday Udoh, in his welcome address, said the election conducted by INEC was adjudged right in the eyes of the world.</p>
      <p>According to him, the process, which started in May 2019, was characterised by a lot of tension following fears that it would be marred by violence and killings.</p>
      <p>But he noted that through various engagements with stakeholders, civil society groups, alternative dispute mechanism and security agencies, the election was free, fair and credible.</p>
      <p>He said despite pockets of skirmishes in some areas, no life was lost in the election.</p>
