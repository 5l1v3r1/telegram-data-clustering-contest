        <b>The now ex-Spain coach Robert Moreno broke his silence when he was interviewed by the waiting media after his sudden departure as Spain head coach.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>"I don't know what happened, ask Luis Enrique</b>," Robert Moreno responded loud and clear when the waiting journalists asked him about his dismissal. </p>
      <p>After some journalists asked him why Luis Enrique did not want him to stay on as his number two, Roberto said: <b>"I don't know, ask him</b>."</p>
      <p>He followed up these comments <b>by saying that the best thing to do was to remain silent </b>because of possible consequences if he decided to speak out. </p>
      <p>"I think the best thing for both parties is for it to remain between us. If the other side want to speak, they can speak.<b> I have nothing to say because I don't think it's good for anybody</b>," Robert said to the press. </p>
