      <p>To expand its global presence, Spicejet has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Gulf Air, the national carrier of the Kingdom of Bahrain.</p>
      <p>The deal will involve an interline and codeshare agreement that will allow both the carriers to offer better connectivity and flexibility on sectors between India and Kingdom of Bahrain.</p>
      <p>Commenting on this new partnership, Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, Spicejet said, “I am extremely happy at the signing of this MoU and the beginning of this new partnership between Spicejet and Gulf Air. This partnership will immensely benefit the two airlines and our passengers in times to come.</p>
      <p>“These are exciting times for SpiceJet as we pursue our international expansion plan. We are developing an extensive portfolio of destinations both at home and in international markets. The middle east has always been among our top priority markets. This agreement is going to play a very important role for Spicejet’s next phase of growth as we continue to explore the innumerable opportunities around us.”</p>
      <p>In addition to the interline and codeshare, the deal will also look at Spicejet and Gulf Air enhancing their coordinated cargo and engineering services. The two airlines will also collaborate in the field of pilot training.</p>
