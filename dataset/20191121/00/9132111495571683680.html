      <p>The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) continues to justify why they made a u-turn and decided to campaign against the upcoming referendum.</p>
      <p>The Minority in Parliament supported the amendment of Article 55 of the 1992 Constitution until the National Chairman of the NDC at a press conference indicated a change of mind and called on Ghanaians to vote ‘No’ in the December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>This decision has been met with some criticisms from the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) who feel the NDC acted in bad faith.</p>
      <p>The National Communications Officer of the NDC, Sammy Gyamfi reacting to the NPP on UTV's morning show 'Adekye Nsroma' queried; "we have changed our mind and so what?"</p>
