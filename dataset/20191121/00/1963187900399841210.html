      <p>CAIRO â€“ 20 November 2019: Removing the piles of accumulated waste off the roads and service areas in 6th of October City in Giza has started, in a bid to maintain a clean environment and a decent appearance. <br/><br/>The waste is collected from vacant areas in the northern area of the city, estimated at more than 5 million cubic meters. <br/><br/>Sherif el-Sherbeiny, the head of the 6th of October City Development Authority, said that the move comes as part of a cooperation protocol signed between the Military Production and the Urban Communities Authority, represented in the 6th of October City Authority. <br/><br/>The waste removal procedures are supervised by a committee from the authority and are carried out in coordination with the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency. <br/><br/>A total of 80 million tons of garbage are collected in Egypt each year, with most of them ending up in piles in the streets. The government has taken several steps over the years to contain the growing waste crisis in the country by raising awareness and announcing fines of up to LE 20,000 for littering streets. <br/><br/>Sherbeiny further said that the city is prepared to face rainwater accumulation during winter season, adding that areas with accumulated water will be linked to the main sewer network. <br/><br/>Sherbeiny explained that such steps are taken within the framework of the city's efforts to face the heavy rains and floods.</p>
