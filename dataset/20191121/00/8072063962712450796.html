      <p><b>(PRESS RELEASE) –</b> The Department of Infrastructure, Ports and Energy informs the motoring and pedestrian public of the start of the second and final phase of the Sandals to Choc Road Widening Project on Saturday November 23, 2019. These finishing works which include Milling and Asphalting are schedule to be complete in eight days.</p>
      <p>All works will be undertaken between 10pm and 6am in an effort to minimize public inconvenience.</p>
      <p>Motorists are informed that there will be temporary diversion of vehicular traffic only during construction hours.</p>
      <p>The Northbound Lane from Friendship Inn to Choc Roundabout will be closed to normal traffic. The Southbound Dual Lanes between Choc and the Friendship Inn Roundabouts will be converted into two-way traffic, which means that one lane will accommodate southbound traffic while the other lane will accommodate northbound traffic.</p>
