      <p>Just two weeks remain in the regular season before the college football championship games Dec. 6-7. The College Football Playoff (CFP) rankings remained unchanged for the top seven spots from Tuesday’s third CFP poll. But previously unbeaten Minnesota and Baylor both lost close contests last week with the Bears falling in the closing minutes to Oklahoma 34-31 after leading 31-10 at halftime.No. 4 Georgia held its spot in the rankings after holding off Auburn’s fourth quarter rally with a 21-14 road win as a 3-point favorite. The Bulldogs have secured their spot in the SEC Championship game Dec. 7 as the SEC East champs.</p>
      <p>The other six teams in the CFP top-7 all won in blowout fashion last week with LSU’s 58-37 rout of Ole Miss the closest margin of victory. LSU quarterback Joe Burrow threw five touchdown passes to become the clear favorite to win the <a href="https://www.thelines.com/odds/heisman/">Heisman Trophy</a>. DraftKings Sportsbook has Burrow (-1115) the prohibitive Heisman favorite followed by Ohio State QB Justin Fields (+700) and Oklahoma QB Jalen Hurts (+1200).</p>
      <p>Burrow has passed for 3,687 yards with 78% completion and 38 touchdown passes to just six interceptions this season. Burrow’s Heisman Trophy opening odds in February at the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas were 200-1. His odds were still 100-1 at many sportsbooks at the start of the season, and dropped to 20-1 at FanDuel Sportsbook following a five touchdown performance in Week 1 in a 55-3 rout of Georgia Southern. In Week 2, Burrow threw for 471 yards and four touchdowns to beat Texas in Austin, 45-38. His Heisman odds dropped to 5-1 and it’s been clear sailing since leading LSU to an undefeated season and No. 1 ranking after <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayginsbach/2019/11/14/college-football-playoff-rankings-lsu-moves-to-no-1-after-beating-alabama-in-biggest-bet-game-of-season/#340118ba7acd">beating Alabama</a> 46-41. LSU is now a 44-point favorite over Arkansas this week, and a Tigers win secures a SEC Championship game appearance against Georgia following next week’s home game against Texas A&amp;M.</p>
      <p>Alabama is still on the outside looking in and now given just a 13% chance to make the College Football Playoff after star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a season-ending injury in last week’s 38-7 win over Mississippi State. Tagovailoa had successful hip surgery Monday, and sophomore QB Mac Jones will lead the Crimson Tide offense this week against Western Carolina and in next week’s rivalry game at Auburn.</p>
      <p>Just three college football teams remain undefeated, and LSU (10-0), Ohio State (10-0) and Clemson (11-0) are heavy favorites to make the four team College Football Playoff. According to FiveThirtyEight.com’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-college-football-predictions/">statistical probability and predictions</a>, Clemson has a 90% chance to make the College Football Playoff followed by LSU (68%) and Ohio State (64%). Georgia (45%), Oregon (37%), Oklahoma (31%), Utah (25%), Alabama (13%), Penn State (12%) and Minnesota (6%) round out the top 10 teams chances of making the playoff.</p>
      <p>Those percentages will change in the final weeks leading into the conference championship games. Some of the biggest games of the season remain that will determine the College Football Playoff, New Year’s Six bowl games, rivalry weekend bragging rights and bowl eligibility for teams looking to secure their sixth win.</p>
      <p>The biggest games this weekend in the <a href="https://www.thelines.com/college-football-week-13-lines-2019/">Top 25 </a>that will also produce the most betting interest include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No. 8 Penn State at No. 2 Ohio State (-18.5) - 12:00 ET on FOX</li>
        <li>Texas A&amp;M at No. 4 Georgia (-13.5) - 3:30 ET on CBS</li>
        <li>Texas at No. 14 Baylor (-5.5) - 3:30 ET on FS1</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Falling out of the Top-25 this week are Kansas State, Navy and Texas. Moving into the Top-25 are No. 25 SMU, No. 23 USC and No. 22 Iowa State after the Cyclones held off Texas 23-21.</p>
      <p>A big upset by Penn State (9-1) over Ohio State (10-0) this weekend would put the Nittany Lions in the Big Ten Championship game as long as they beat Rutgers next weekend. A win by Ohio State would secure the Big Ten East title for Ohio State regardless of the outcome of next week’s rivalry game at Michigan. Ohio State is currently 7-0 on conference play while Penn State is 6-1. The Big Ten East winner plays Big Ten West champion, Minnesota or Wisconsin, in the Big Ten Championship game.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is an 18.5-point favorite over Ohio State at <a href="https://twitter.com/williamhillus">William Hill </a>Sportsbooks. The Buckeye’s have beaten the Nittany Lions each of the last three years in closes contests by scores of 24-21 in 2016 as a 19.5-favorite, and then 39-38 and 27-26 the last two years when both teams were ranked in the AP Top-10. The huge point spread as a three touchdown favorite this week caught the attention of many bettors. Yet the Buckeye’s are still attracting more than 60% of the spread bets as noted at <a href="https://www.sportsinsights.com/ncaaf/">Sports Insights</a>, which provides live odds and betting data from a consensus of seven <a href="https://osga.com/top-online-sportsbooks.html">leading online sportsbooks</a>. Top-10 teams installed as an underdog (Penn State) of 18 or more points are 0-7 SU and 2-5 ATS.</p>
      <p>In addition, there are some major rivalry games this weekend prior to the biggest rivalry week Nov. 30.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>UCLA at No. 23 USC (-13.5)</li>
        <li>California at Stanford (-2.5)</li>
        <li>Duke at Wake Forest (-7)</li>
        <li>No. 20 Boise State (-8.5) at Utah State</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is still much to be decided in both the College Football Playoff race along with the teams to play in the 11 conference championship games. Ten of those games are on Saturday, Dec. 7 and only five teams have secured a spot in their conference championship games thus far.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clemson in the ACC Championship</li>
        <li>Georgia in the SEC Championship</li>
        <li>Miami (Ohio) in the MAC Championship</li>
        <li>Alcorn State in the SWAC Championship</li>
        <li>Oregon in the Pac-12 Championship (Friday, Dec. 6)</li>
      </ul>
