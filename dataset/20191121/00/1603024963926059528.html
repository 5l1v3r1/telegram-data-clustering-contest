      <p>Japan's ruling coalition has called for an extra budget including $92 billion in spending to revive slowing growth, party officials said on November 21, raising concerns among analysts about the strain this would put on the already heavily indebted economy.</p>
      <p>The agreement, made in a meeting between senior officials of Japan's ruling coalition on Wednesday, highlights the concern among lawmakers about the economic outlook thanks to a sales tax hike in October and slowing global demand.</p>
      <p>"Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe told us to compile a sizable package to take all possible steps on the economy," Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"We want to craft a strong economic package, taking into account the economic situation, global economy and damage caused by typhoons, which were larger than last year, so as to get the economy on a solid growth path."</p>
      <p>But analysts expressed doubt about Abe's ability to spend such a large amount given that Japan's government debt is already twice the size of its $5 trillion economy, making it the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden.</p>
      <p>Major infrastructure spending programmes could also face serious execution problems given that the country's labour market is tighter than it has been in decades as the population ages rapidly.</p>
      <p>"Even if the government secured a budget for big public works, it would be difficult to implement it smoothly," said Kiichi Murashima, economist at Citigroup Global Markets Japan.</p>
      <p>"Chances are low for the government to compile a supplementary budget worth 10 trillion yen ($92 billion). We expect the size of this fiscal year's extra budget to fall short of 5 trillion yen."</p>
      <p>The government will compile a supplementary budget for the current fiscal year ending March 2020, as well as next fiscal year's budget plan in December, allowing funds to be disbursed over a 15-month period, sources said.</p>
      <p>Both budget drafts need parliamentary approval to take effect.</p>
      <p>Supplementary budgets of more than 10 trillion yen have only been compiled four times in the past, including after Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011.</p>
      <p>The ruling bloc's requests focus on spending for disaster relief from a string of typhoons that struck Japan earlier this year and funding to help farmers cope with the fallout from a U.S.-Japan trade deal that opens the market to some U.S. goods.</p>
      <p>The government also aims to step up efforts to encourage corporate investment.</p>
      <p>It plans to establish a 220 billion yen fund to help the private sector develop post-5G ultra high-speed communications technology. It also aims to set up a framework to help small firms, which employ seven out of 10 workers in Japan, spur capital expenditure on condition that they increase pay, the Nikkei business daily reported.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Abe ordered his cabinet to compile a package of stimulus measures to cope with external risks and large natural disasters, and support the economy after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>"We need a huge supplementary budget sized at least around 10 trillion yen," Abe's Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) heavyweight Toshihiro Nikai told reporters earlier this week.</p>
