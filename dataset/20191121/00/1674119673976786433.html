        <b>Chris Berrow and Leigh Milner review the latest CoD game.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chris - When I finally finally managed to get to the game I started off playing the single player which is I like to do but a single play. Before we launch into the online because that's what modern warfare is all about you know playing on moments like this game that it's super serious. One of my favorite super super smooth hits you know that the shooting is amazing the story's pretty good actually some of the favorite characters make an appearance again like soap. It's a guy called Soap because backing out different is a very similar very similar if he played a cooler duty modern warfare before you have played essentially this game. This the second mission though quite violent and it's terrorism on the streets of London. And for me it didn't sit right. That's a commission that it felt a bit odd. It seems okay when it's kind of you know notionally random bad guys but when it's when it was on the streets of London especially given recent times that I don't know that it feel right to me to do that.</p>
      <p>Leigh - Yeah. Some people would say you know it's fictional and fighting goes on all the time all over the world and we see that in games.</p>
      <p>Chris - I mean I'd say six out of ten for the solo. Now the multiplayer which is what it's really all about when it comes to culture says the best yet. Super super smooth. The best online experience I've had playing ecology. There's this thing called Hardcore Team Deathmatch which is my ideal my ideal way of playing this game.</p>
