      <p>Data is omnipresent. As a result, data privacy becomes a critical issue for organizations large and small. Increased regulation on data privacy -- ranging from General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) -- at the local, national and global scale, coupled with increased consumer awareness and changing expectations, are bringing change to the forefront. Today, there is a more distinct focus on operationalizing data privacy than ever before, with major companies investing larger portions of their budget, hiring top security talent and developing key guidelines around privacy.At its core, data improves products and enriches services for a personalized experience. While tech behemoths, such as Google, Apple and Facebook, are driving AI-enabled technology and bringing about exciting changes to nearly every industry, this technology is built on a foundation of potentially problematic metadata.</p>
      <p>Recently, some of the brightest minds in data privacy gathered at a dinner event hosted by ElevateData, a leadership initiative focused on scaling practical knowledge sharing among data executives, to discuss these issues. Collectively, these data privacy experts identified major trends in the space today and what challenges and solutions might look like tomorrow.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Four Pillars Of Data Privacy Today</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Data privacy operationalization is a multilayered problem.</b> When it comes to ensuring data privacy, the collection, storage and usage of data is critical, in addition to machine learning algorithms, deletion and more. Nimble technology companies have pounced on the opportunity to provide solutions for each of these factors: compliance software, tools and systems are on their way to the market.</p>
      <p><b>Using existing tools.</b> Today, there are companies that offer solutions to ensure the visibility, security and accountability of data flow between applications and data sources. Existing compliance software helps satisfy GDPR requirements, while more comprehensive software helps the integration and operation of data that flows between organizations. These tools are important to navigate difficulties such as data purging and metadata that lingers on third-party cloud services.</p>
      <p><b>Limitations of solutions.</b> External solutions tend to be focused on a narrower set of data and product development technologies. Almost all of the companies in the current environment operate on a diverse technology stack, making it difficult to find a single privacy solution to fit an entire organization’s needs. Currently, finding the best solution is a balanced mix of internal, semi-external and external technology solutions. As the technology sector matures, we expect more comprehensive technology to emerge. In the meantime, we’ll have to be more piecemeal with our solutions.</p>
      <p><b>Anonymizing datasets. </b>There has been significant progress made on the de-identification and anonymization of data. Tokenization platforms in the future will be able to provide a layer of assurance and comfort for consumers in mass data sharing. Apple and Google’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11787006_1">differential privacy</a> systems seek to share data without identifying details. Similarly, <a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45648">federated learning</a>, a new approach to machine learning pioneered by Google, keeps sensitive information on devices while enabling sharing at scale.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Challenge: Tapping And Developing The Right Talent</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The talent pool is nascent. </b>Operationalizing privacy solutions requires a specialized talent skill set, and companies across all sectors are struggling to find the right technical talent to meet demand. Additionally, there has yet to be a consensus around the definition of privacy-focused roles, such as privacy engineer or privacy product manager, which makes it even harder to find the right talent. The privacy problem touches all aspects of an organization and will require a diverse pool of people to tackle it, ranging from the aspirational metadata experts to the privacy product manager.</p>
      <p><b>Educate, train and equip future privacy pioneers. </b>To bridge this talent gap, it will be critical to internally develop the right talent by creating opportunities for training and regulatory literacy in this field. We need engineers and product managers who can develop products with a privacy perspective, and we must develop programs to cultivate and enrich engineers who have the skills and passion for security. That might look like offering focused training, creating relevant incentives around privacy or career development opportunities to those eager to grow into a new privacy-focused role. The demand for formal education is growing, too. As an example, Carnegie Mellon currently offers a Master of Science in privacy engineering, and other educational institutions are following suit.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A Path Forward: Bridging The Gap Between Policy And Technology</b>
      </p>
      <p>A central focus of privacy efforts across organizations will be mobilizing legal and compliance teams alongside technical and engineering teams in lockstep. Organizational structures will need to evolve in order to bring engineering and nonengineering teams together with the right ownership and incentives.</p>
      <p>This will drive a new paradigm shift for organizations. In many companies, engineering dominates development budgets. Specifically, this budget goes to increasing the speed and development of features that directly serve the end-user experience. Adding more privacy features often slows product development, despite its importance and investment. There is an immense opportunity for C-level leadership alignment to prioritize the shift to data privacy in product development. Long term, this might look like the collaboration and alignment of data privacy design principles, goals and incentives to adopt a “privacy by design” mentality.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Getting Started</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here are three steps that can give your organization a kick-start to begin operationalizing data privacy.</p>
      <p>1. Understand the data available in your organization and key internal and external flows.</p>
      <p>2. Evaluate risks associated with the data, and benchmark with your peers.</p>
      <p>3. Start building out a privacy team, beginning with key technical talent.</p>
      <p>The full adoption of privacy operations, design and execution is a critical project that requires multiple stakeholders, fresh talent and buy-in from leadership. As emerging technology principles and strategies develop around privacy and come to market, the landscape will look much different than it does today. Until then, leaning on existing solutions, focusing on developing the right talent and aligning internal incentives can help you get started operationalizing data privacy across your organization.</p>
