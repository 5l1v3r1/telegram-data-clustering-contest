      <h1>Ensure win, or lose your job: Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa to ministers during meet</h1>

      <p>Ensure that BJP candidates win or be ready to lose your ministerial berths,” is what Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa has told his Cabinet colleagues.<br/><br/>The Chief Minister’s stern warning came during an informal chat soon after the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. <br/><br/>The BJP has to win at least eight of the 15 Assembly byelections if Yediyurappa has to continue in power. <br/><br/>Aware of this precarious position, the Chief Minister deployed every minister in his Cabinet to each of the 15 constituencies going for polls and told them to take up door-to-door campaign. <br/><br/>“Go the constituencies assigned to you by Friday and camp there until the campaign ends on December 3,” he is said to have told all his Ministers including three deputy Chief Ministers. <br/><br/><br/>“Winning elections is not an easy task. Take the task assigned to you seriously. I will get all information about what you are going to do. If anyone fails to win, be ready to be dropped from the Cabinet,” he warned them, a source said. <br/><br/>Asking his Ministers to take every local leader together, the Chief Minister told them to sort out any differences among leaders with the sole intention of winning the polls. When a few Ministers asked Yediyurappa to change the constituencies assigned to them, the latter is said to have turned down the proposal. <br/><br/><br/>“I am not bothered about all this. All I want is to win elections. You do whatever it takes to win the byelections,’ he is said to have told them.</p>
