      <p>A scheduling clash has been blamed for the postponement which was to feature Kate Ceberano and band, John Morrison's Swing City Band featuring Jacki Cooper, The Aston Martinis and The Djangologists<i>.</i> A new date has been announced for Saturday, October 31.</p>
      <p>"We hate to change the date of any event, however the clash has left us no other option. We had hoped to find a date a bit sooner, but on the back of Ms Ceberano's recent success on 'The Masked Singer' her touring schedule for the early months in 2020 is understandably full," Michael Hope said.</p>
      <p>"For those who hold a ticket for the December 2019 show, tickets will automatically transfer to the new date with an upgrade or gift on us. For those who prefer a refund, they can contact us via email info@hopeestate.com.au."</p>
