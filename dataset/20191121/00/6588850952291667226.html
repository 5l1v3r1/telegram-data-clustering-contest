      <p>Veteran journalist, Kwesi Pratt, has expressed fear that the 2020 general election is likely to be characterized by violence, if stringent steps are not taken to ‘sanitize the Electoral Commission”.<br/><br/>He says the conduct of the 2020 elections could have significant consequences for the democratic trajectory of the country if characters like Dr Eric Bossman Asare remain in office.<br/><br/>The Managing Editor of the Insight newspaper said this on <i>Metro TV</i> on Wednesday while commenting on Dr Bossman Asare’s recent call for a ‘Yes’ vote in the upcoming referendum.<br/><br/>The Deputy Electoral Commissioner’s call for a ‘Yes’ vote has attracted widespread criticism from political watchers and opposition politicians.<br/><br/>Kwesi Pratt emphasized that Ghana was at a threshold of monumental disaster if drastic measures were not taken to check EC officials who publicly misconduct themselves.<br/><br/>He said the country is heading for doom if it fails in its continued fight against dubious persons who occupy sensitive positions at public institutions.<br/><br/>“I am scandalized by his conduct. Is this the EC that is going to conduct the 2020 elections? What confidence do I have participating in this election when I know that its vice chairman has a position?<br/>“I am shocked by his conduct and this is not the type of electoral commission we want in this country,” Mr Kwesi Pratt stressed.<br/><br/>Next month’s referendum is to enable citizens to vote on the proposed amendment of Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution that bars political parties from participating in District Level Elections.<br/><br/>Article 55 (3) which is an entrenched position states that: “…Subject to the provisions of this Article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character, and sponsor candidates for elections to any public office other than to District Assemblies or lower local government units”.<br/>The provision can only be amended through a referendum which per Article 290(4) of the 1992 constitution, can be approved when at least 40% of persons entitled to vote, vote at the referendum and at least 75% of the persons who vote cast their votes in favour of passing the bill.<br/>If carried, the proposed amendment will introduce multi-party participation in the local government system in Ghana.
