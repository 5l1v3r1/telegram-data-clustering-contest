      <p>In the past few years people have started building and buying <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sherikoones/2019/10/18/why-millennials-are-buying-smaller-more-efficient-houses/#22fc11eb4558">smaller houses</a>. One of the main reasons for this is the saving in building cost, but there is also the savings in energy costs and the reduced maintenance required for a small house. Many people today, both millennials and older people want to live a simpler life, in a smaller space, with less “stuff” around. People are also more concerned today than ever about the carbon footprint of building a large house. Along with building smaller houses come smaller kitchens. In the past few years there have been a preponderance of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sherikoones/2019/03/18/small-scale-appliances-for-small-and-tiny-kitchens/#2afe36401c3a">small appliances</a> coming on the market. And when a kitchen is small, it is very helpful when as many of the kitchen small appliances are as multi-functional as possible, to save on space. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, the appliance market is adapting to the upswing in smaller kitchens with not only smaller appliances but also multifunctional smaller machines. </p>
      <p>One of the newest small appliances to come on the market is an air fryer oven. I could never have appreciated the advantage of having an air fryer until I recently saw a demonstration of some vegetables being air fried and them coming out quickly, not only cooked, but also browned. For those with a small kitchen space, where space is at a premium, what a great invention to have - an air fryer that now comes along with a small oven that bakes, broils, roasts, toasts and warms up food.  Several companies produce air fryers, including <a href="https://www.bydash.com/">Dash Appliances</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GoWISE-USA-12-7-Quarts-Rotisserie-Dehydrator/dp/B07LBZGD97/ref=sr_1_5?crid=GQJJS41B4X2H&amp;keywords=gowise+air+fryer&amp;qid=1574367934&amp;sprefix=GoWISE+%2Caps%2C159&amp;sr=8-5">GoWise</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chefman-Digital-Air-Fryer-Rotisserie/dp/B07KWFC5Y7/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=22SS3ONSXNQ07&amp;keywords=chefman+air+fryer&amp;qid=1574367832&amp;sprefix=chefman%2Caps%2C153&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQlVXOTJSNTc0TEVDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjU3NDcxM0I1Q0NBR0JDVjIwRiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTM0MTg5MUFWNlMzVkpDTTlTTCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=">Chefman</a> with multifunctional options.  Each of these products have a variety of functions such as rotisserie oven, and roasting, baking and dehydrating elements.</p>
      <p>Another appliance that is multifunctional is the <a href="https://www.zeny.us/search?q=pressure+cooker&amp;type=product&amp;product_cat=al">Zeny</a> pressure cooker, rice maker, steamer, sautér, yogurt maker and warmer. This appliance is programmable for all of these functions.</p>
      <p>Most people who cook like to have a stand-up mixer, but now that can be combined with a blender to avoid having so many appliances.   These are available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CHEFTRONIC-SM1086-Silver-Standing-Mixer-Silver/dp/B07QX9C4SR/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=cheftronic+stand+mixer+tilt-head&amp;qid=1574368254&amp;sr=8-4">Cheftonic</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nurxiovo-Kitchen-Stainless-Blender-Extracter/dp/B07XXCHGXM/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=blenders+and+stand+up+mixers&amp;qid=1574368370&amp;sr=8-13">Nurxiovo </a>. Food processors can also be had with a juicer and food processor by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081T8H7LX/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1YAS2NA4XXBR0&amp;keywords=cuisinart+kitchen+central+with+blender%2C+juicer+and+food+processor&amp;qid=1574368601&amp;sprefix=cuisinart+kitchen+central%2Caps%2C139&amp;sr=8-2">Cuisinart</a>.</p>
      <p>With Thanksgiving coming this week, a great tool to have is an immersion blender by <a href="https://www.qvc.com/Geoffrey-Zakarian-330W-Immersion-Blender-with-Attachments.product.K49326.html?colorId=X64&amp;sizeId=000&amp;ref=GBA&amp;cm_mmc=GOOGLESHOPPINGFEED-_-GShopping%7CL%7CBrandProduct%7Ccooking+dining%7Csmall+appliances-_-pla-_-s%7Cdc_41632030546_aud-716512967714:pla-810698441278__K49326-X64-000_&amp;mkwid=s%7Cdc_pcrid_41632030546_810698441278_pkw__pmt__productid_K49326-X64-000&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAiNnuBRD3ARIsAM8KmlswrST5H7rExw2Re6HfPW2jFOq25ufg9OnkmycsK87IiWx86KaDXWgaAjeuEALw_wcB&amp;TZ=EST">Geoffrey Zakarian </a>, which comes with attachments to blend soup, mix a batter, whisk and mash - all in one</p>
      <p>A new evolution of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/George-Foreman-5-Serving-Multi-Plate-GRP4842RB/dp/B00NPYJWE8/ref=sr_1_3?gclid=Cj0KCQiAiNnuBRD3ARIsAM8Kmlty-QhwacjO5U5Z0XfEssps6WlASL38MZPLgwi1auROF6gw0BvfLbcaAnzCEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=241598345663&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9003436&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvrand=140464760836233247&amp;hvtargid=kwd-29837442897&amp;hydadcr=20216_10157688&amp;keywords=george+forman+grill+evolve&amp;qid=1574369300&amp;sr=8-3">George Forman grill</a> now allows the home cook to grill a steak, make waffles, muffins, and grilled sandwiches.</p>
      <p>Another item that is extremely useful in the home is the <a href="https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/wolf-gourmet-multi-cooker/?Kenshoo=b57354a0-2449-4d3a-97b6-99264b56c816&amp;cm_ven=NonBrandSearch&amp;cm_cat=Google&amp;cm_pla=NonBrand_Search_DSA&amp;cm_ite=&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAiNnuBRD3ARIsAM8Kmls819Qf68ODh5OhOiS6d8NJGi6DHJONao_LBWge6rem_XaQxDMq7rgaAlI7EALw_wcB">Wolf slow cooker </a>which also sears and braises, and simmers rice with the inner pot also functional on the stove top.</p>
      <p>With the recent popularity of tiny and small houses, there are apt to be many more multifunctional appliances coming on the market in the future. </p>
