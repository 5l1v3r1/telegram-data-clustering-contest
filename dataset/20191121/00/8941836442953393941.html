      <p>LONDON (AP) - The British band Coldplay has decided not to launch a global tour because of environmental concerns.</p>
      <p>Frontman Chris Martin told the BBC Thursday that the band is not going on tour to promote its latest album because it wants to take time to determine how a tour can be beneficial to the environment.</p>
      <p>He said: “We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral.”</p>
      <p>He says the band has had a number of major tours and wants to find a way to make the next tour more about giving than taking.</p>
      <p>The album “Everyday Life” will be released Friday.</p>
