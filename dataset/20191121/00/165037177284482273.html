        <b>Gerard Piqué gave an extensive interview to 'Mundo Deportivo'. The FC Barcelona central defender went over all Barcelona related news: his retirement, Griezmann, Valverde, the Davis Cup, his more personal side...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before returning to the pitch after the international break, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-pique-23560/">Gerard Pique</a> is promoting the new Davis Cup that is currently being played in Madrid. A key player for Spain and one of Barcelona's captains, the player spoke at length in a personal interview.</p>
      <p>The central defender, beloved by fan, openly recognized he is thinking about the end of his time as a footballer: "I've always said, <b>my last team will be Barça</b>. I don't see myself wearing any other shirt than Barça's. For me, being in Barça is the greatest dream of all, no matter how much the creating f the new Davis Cup is also one of my dreams."</p>
      <p>"My intention is to stop playing by 2022, but I do not have a crystal ball and I do not know if I will be able to. If I see that I lose importance or I see that I am not at the level I have no problem in leaving before. I think it will not happen because I know me and<b> I see myself able to hold until 2022</b>, but you never know, "he added.</p>
      <p>The captain showed his<b> love for Barcelona</b>, but he's never been secretive about the fact that he has other interests. In this regard, <b>Davis Cup</b> is his new hobby: "There are players who have restaurants or other businesses, others play video games, spend their days on their phones, others devote their time to being with their families ... <b>each devotes his time to what he thinks fills him most</b>."</p>

      <p>Also, Piqué continued in the same line: "We know that our careers are short, limited and when it is finished I would like to be able to do other things and <b>make sure that it's not all over with "Pique the player", </b>I would like there to be more than just football".</p>
      <p>Finally, Barça's '4' showed his more personal side and spoke of his ritual before the games. "On match days I sleep 10 hours at night and nap for two hours. If it's true that there are some days I sleep less, but not just to organize the Davis Cup, it's also because I like the NBA and the games are late, I'm sure other people do it," he concluded.</p>
