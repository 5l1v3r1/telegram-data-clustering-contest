      <p>The Confederation of African Football (CAF) have announced that the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN) will be held in April in Cameroon.</p>
      <p>The CAF Executive Committee on Thursday decided the biennial football competition will run from 4th to 25th April, 2020.</p>
      <p>The tournament is played between the best national teams of Africa, exclusively featuring players who are active in the national championships and qualified to play in the ongoing season.</p>
      <p>Expatriate players, regardless of where they play, even in Africa, are not qualified to take part in the tournament.</p>
