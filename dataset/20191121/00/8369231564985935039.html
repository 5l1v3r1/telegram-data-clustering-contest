      <p>Scientists are predicting a rare meteor outburst this week that may be brief but incredibly intense.</p>
      <p>A brilliant flurry in the sky near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoceros">Unicorn constellation</a> is expected Thursday night over the eastern half of North America and all South America.</p>
      <p>The action should unfold early Friday morning over the western portions of Europe and Africa.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of shooting stars may be visible as Earth plows through the dusty tail of an unidentified comet.</p>

      <p>The alpha Monocerotids - named after the constellation Monoceros or the Unicorn - most recently produced an outburst in 1995.</p>
      <p>NASA's Ames Research Center scientist Peter Jenniskens and the Finnish Fireball Networks' Esko Lyytinen anticipate another good show.</p>
      <p>They encourage stargazers to look up, but get out early because peak viewing time is short.</p>
