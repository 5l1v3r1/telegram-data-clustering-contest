      <h1>CircuitPython Sculpture Clock Adds Character To Any Desk</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/cornbreadninja/" target="_blank">Kristina Panos</a></address>
      <p>We can probably all relate to the origin story of this one. [Alex] was working on a bigger, more involved clock project when <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/165822-circuitpython-7-segment-character-clock">this cute little desk clock idea</a> caught his mind’s eye. Who wouldn’t want a clock with character and a little bit of an attitude?</p>
      <p>This little guy’s brain is an ItsyBitsy M0 Express, and he gets his time data from an Adalogger FeatherWing RTC. Those antennae aren’t just for looks – [Alex] chose the ItsyBitsy because it can easily do capacitive touch out of the box without extra components. In the brief demo after the break, [Alex] shows how touching them triggers either an animated face or a still face before switching to the clock face.</p>
      <p>We love functional circuit sculptures, especially ones with this much character. [Alex] was inspired by <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/11/19/flywire-circuits-at-the-next-level/">[Mohit Bhoite]’s breathtaking circuit sculptures</a> and seems to follow his great example of laying it all out on paper first. Incidentally, our last HackChat before Supercon starred [Mohit] and his circuit sculptures. Missed it? Read the transcript <a href="https://hackaday.io/event/167692/logs">here</a>.</p>
