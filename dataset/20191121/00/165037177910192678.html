        <b>Spanish newspapers have criticised Gareth Bale after he was pictured behind a banner that read: "WALES. GOLF. MADRID... IN THAT ORDER".</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Gareth Bale's</a> popularity in Spain <b>appears to have sunk to an all-time low </b>as he heads back to <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> following international duty.</p>
      <p>Not sighted in LaLiga for well over a month, the winger made his second Wales start in four days as Ryan Giggs' men secured Euro 2020 qualification with a 2-0 win over Hungary on Tuesday. <b>Bale's timely return to fitness prompted suspicion</b>, and his actions after the game have attracted more scorn in certain sections of the Spanish media, <b>who have routinely criticised him for spending too much time </b>on the golf course.</p>
      <p>In Cardiff, he was pictured celebrating with Wales team-mates <b>behind a banner that read: "WALES. GOLF. MADRID</b>... IN THAT ORDER".</p>
      <p>Madrid newspaper Marca, <b>said to have close links to the powerful club</b> that employs Bale, did not take kindly to what has been perceived as a mocking gesture. The front page of its Thursday edition featured Bale and the headline: <b>"DISRESPECTFUL. WRONG. UNGRATEFUL</b>. IN THAT ORDER".</p>

      <p>AS,<b> also headquartered in the Spanish capital</b>, depicted the four-time Champions League winner sinking a close-range putt alongside the headline: "BALE IS IN A HOLE".</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, online newspaper El Espanol captured the order of priorities supporters expect – "MADRID. MADRID. MADRID. IN THAT ORDER" – while columnist <b>Tomas Roncero summed up what appears to lay ahead</b>.</p>

      <p><b>The media message crossed borders ahead of Madrid's meeting</b> with Real Sociedad on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In an interview with The Athletic, ex-Madrid president Ramon Calderon called Bale "childish" and <b>claimed fans were "very angry" with the one-time €100million signing</b>.</p>
