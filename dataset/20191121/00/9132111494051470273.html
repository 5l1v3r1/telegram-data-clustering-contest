      <p>A former director-general of the Ghana Health Service (GHS) Dr. Elias Sori has expressed concerns over the controversy surrounding the removal of the new director-general by the President.</p>
      <p>Dr Baffour Awuah who was appointed by the President on November 5,2019 has had his appointment withdrawn days after some health workers claiming to be members of the ruling party petitioned the President over his loyalty to the NPP.</p>
      <p>We the health fraternity and true party members of NPP would like to draw the presidents attention to this greatest mistake NPP can ever make in health, so is the party saying no faithful member is qualified enough to occupy the position of Director General-GHS after Dr Nsia Asare other than Dr Baffour Awuah we all know his party affiliations and biases, what happened to we have the men mantra we have always shouted.</p>
      <p>“So the NPP government led by Nana Addo Dankwa Akuffo Addo is telling the well-meaning Health workers who sacrificed everything and went against all odds that their efforts don’t deserve a reward by appointing a true party person to steer the affairs of this important office in health and take over from Dr Anthony “Drone” Nsia Asare,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the development, Dr. Sori told Francis Abban on the Morning Starr the appointment of the GHS director over the years has had nothing to do with politics. ‘</p>
      <p>“When Prof. Akorsah said he was not going to extend his stay as DG, an advert was placed both nationally &amp; internationally to have him replaced and I applied. A list was given to Publishing Service who conducted an interview and reported back to the President for appointment to be made.The advert that was put up at the time didn’t have any party color. The person who heads the Ghana Health Service is not to be a party person. You come in as an expert to assist the Minister and President.</p>
      <p>“I have been in the public service for a very long time. I never held a party card for any political party and I have never owned one”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, labour consultant Austin has asked the dismissed GHS boss to petition the President over his removal.</p>
      <p>“Under normal circumstances, if I were the President I’ll engage the relevant stakeholders and get the man back to work. We should stop doing this evil to ourselves. If someone belongs to another political party but can serve the nation under another government why deny him/her the opportunity”.</p>
