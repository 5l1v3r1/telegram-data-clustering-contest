      <p><b>lana el samman</b>, a lebanon-born interior designer, embraces the heritage of sharjah, UAE, in a modular table-cum-shelf collection called <b>mokaعab</b>, which translates as ‘cube’ from arabic. it builds upon the traditional architectural practice of women weaving palm fonds for wall and ceiling decorations, floor mats, handheld fans and baskets. the designer has intertwined these centuries-old silhouettes with modern patterns, folds and geometric shapes. here, camel leather and khoos are intricately woven into a top surface. a wooden structure, made from hard-carved tubes and connected by metal angular components, create a uniform shape that can be attached and stacked together. the versatile furniture can then be adapted to its changing surroundings, from a side table to a set of shelves.</p>

      <p><b>lana el samman’s mokaعab collection</b> is the result of <a href="https://tashkeel.org/"><b>tashkeel</b></a>’s intensive development program called <b>tanween</b>, which encompasses a residency year of labs, workshops and mentoring for creatives. set up in 2013 by tashkeel, an art facility, it challenges upcoming designers in the region to respond to the rapidly developing contemporary scene in the UAE. it does so by nurturing the growth of art and design whilst also establishing and continuing to connect makers with artisan skills, materials and production. the results, like el samma’s collection, engage in cross-cultural dialogue.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://binchyandbinchy.com/">binchy and binchy</a>’s ten tables collection</b> mixes rich, local heritage with revolutionary materials. with the UAE-based architectural practice understanding that architecture should be an extension of a certain time and place in history, their range of design objects, which appear as tables, captures this philosophy on a smaller scale. each of the 10 pieces reference one of their architectural projects, either in their form, materials or both. although looking incredibly sturdy as if constructed from stone, granite or concrete, the bases are actually made from a process that compresses thousands of paper sheets. the tops, however, offer a distinct contrast. they feature bespoke, intricate patterns made from luxurious materials that encapsulate traditional symbolism, culture and ethnic elements.</p>

      <p>spanning across the middle east, north africa, and south east and central asia, <a href="http://irthi.com/"><b>irthi contemporary crafts council</b></a>’s program of creative, cultural and commercial initiatives is designed to empower women through indigenous craft. ranging from sculptural totem-like chair stacks to hand-blown palestinian glass, their latest exhibition at downtown editions displays a range of crafted design objects that exemplify rich hand-making heritage of sarjah and the UAE. their two initiatives encourage the sharing of knowledge: <b>crafts dialogue</b> forms collaborations between UAE and global designers to exchange art and production techniques; and<b> design labs</b> acts as a residency where bidwa artisans, enrolled in the bidwa social development program, are paired with regional and international designers.</p>

      <p>in crafts dialogue, <b>emirati clay x italian murano glass by fatima al zaabi and matteo silverio</b> fuses emirati and european materials to craft an intricate vase, lamp and phone charger collection. it not only juxtaposes the fragility of glass with the sturdiness of clay into single objects, but also blends handmade and computerized techniques. here, parametric design and digital fabrication tools were used to create molds while artisans hand-manipulated the glass and clay.</p>

      <p>inspired by the local region in terms of both craft and visual cues, <b>safeefah by ghaya bin mesmar and mermedlada estudio</b> is a palm fond-weaved chair collection. it was inspired by a single image of a desert house – made from the namesake weaving technique – that had been blown down by the wind to resemble a cone shape. this form was mirrored in the chairs to allow for both privacy and protection from the elements. its conical back welcomes users within. the design modernizes the traditional safeefah weave by adding a unique, vibrant color range.</p>

      <p>in irthi’s design labs initiative, the <b>safeefah x sand casting by irthi and nadia taryam, faisal tabbarah and khawla al hashimi of architecture and other things</b> is a collection of sand-casted furniture. forming a table and a set of stools, the range began as an experiment of different combinations of water, sand, concrete, clay and soil. the resulting rock-like material was set into special frames to form these soft yet monolithic shapes. safeefah-weaved camel leather is then laid on top of the structures, before falling down towards the floor.</p>
