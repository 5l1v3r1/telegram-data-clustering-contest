      <p>The Office of Vice President Jewel Howard-Taylor extended deepest condolences to the Liberty Party, Brumskine family, Grand Bass County and the people of Liberia for the passing of Cllr. Brumskine, describing him as a legal luminary whose contributions to Liberia’s Justice system and political sphere will truly be missed. “His death is not only a great loss for his family, partisans of the Liberty Party and the great people of Grand Bassa County, but for the entire Country. Our thoughts and prayers also go to the judiciary, the Liberia Bar Association and all those broken by this great loss.”<br/><br/>On the social medium Facebook, expression of sympathy also poured from a cross section of Liberians including former Foreign Minister Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan who described the fallen politician as an erudite lawyer and astute Liberian politician and statesman. “He has run his earthly race and has transitioned from mortality to immortality. During his earthly sojourn, the erudite statesman contributed immensely to the consolidation of the Liberian democracy and was a towering personality who left large, indelible footprints on the Liberian political landscape over the past three decades.”<br/><br/>The former foreign minister said Cllr. Brumskine was a true Liberian leader. “I personally admired his integrity, eloquence, legal brilliance, and dogged determination to stay the course even when the road was rugged and the sea was turbulent. The passing of this astute Liberian leader is a truth we wish were a lie; the present we wish were the future; and the future we wish were a mirage.”<br/><br/>Gabriel Nyanti lamented that Liberia has lost a rare breed. “I was mesmerized and regaled given the array of unequalled sense of patriotism, and an engaging discourse he advanced on national development. A man never understood by our generation. Most certainly, Liberia grieves a role modeled benevolence of integrity, diligence and a phenomenal devotion to bolstering the rule of law even in troubled times. A man never known by our generation.”</p>

      <p>Rep. Larry Yanquoi(Nimba County Electoral District #8) extended sympathy to the Liberty Party family for the loss of its vision bearer. “For Counselor, as we fondly referred to him, actually loved Bassa; their food (the Dumboy) and the language. He was such a unique personality as far as patriotism to Bass was concerned.”</p>
      <p>Rep. Yanquoi says the fallen political icon specifically remembered for being the first Liberian Politician to expose him to National Politics by allowing me to serve as the founding Chairman of the Liberty Party in 2005, a position in which he served till the party’s first National Convention in Gompa City, Nimba County, later that year. “Counselor, I will remember you for your saying to most of our younger colleagues in FRIENDS OF BRUMSKINE ( FOB) earlier on in 2003-2004, that ” guys, you are my children, but Larry is my Friend”. Your said stance, which was the sign of respect for me, clearly distinguished the youths from me as we cruised through the campaign in 2005 and beyond. Though we politically parted ways later on, our respect for each other never withered.”<br/><br/>Former Information Minister Cletus Sieh says those who have had the opportunity to interact with Cllr. Brumskine have no doubts that he was an icon of peace, honesty and integrity. “Serving as Secretary General of the then Liberia Unification Party, I witnessed the tenacity of a true patriot when his Friends of Brumskine (FOB) joined LUP. Also, his role in bringing peace to the mother land when he and Hon. Isaac Mannah represented LUP at the peace talk in Ghana which produced the Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA) in 2003. I was an observer as Secretary General of LUP.”<br/><br/><b>‘Hats Off to a Noble Hero’</b></p>
      <p>Mourning Cllr. Brumskine’s loss, Robert Kpadeh wrote: “We doff our hats to this noble Hero for his outstanding service to the homeland. His widow, Mrs. Brumskine and kids are in our prayers. Take your bow, Sir!”<br/>Richard Tingbeh expressed his condolences to the family and constituents of Cllr. Brumskine’s stronghold: “My deepest condolences to the bereaved family, the Liberty Party ,the people of Grand Bassa County &amp; All Legal Practitioners of Liberia. Sleep on…. A Proud Son of Grand Bassa County.”</p>
      <p>Prince Maxwell paid homage to the peaceful passing of a father, who was one of Liberia’s outstanding sons, Family man, Patriot, Hero and Scholar.</p>
      <p>Geebah Kaba said Cllr Charles Walker Brumskine’s departure will be a serious setback in Liberia’s political atmosphere. “You will always be remembered Cllr. Rest in peace Papay. Nothing last forever, you did what was expected from you.”</p>
      <p>J Alben Greaves recalled a phenomenal lawyer with sharp instincts for the law and a phenomenal memory that enabled him face the political and legal dispensation whenever he felt laws were transgressed. “What a loss to Liberia”, he chimed.</p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>Greaves recalled a 2008 episode during which he extended an invitation to Cllr. Brumskine to speak to the students at Cuttington University. “He accepted my invitation and spoke to students at Cuttington and youth leaders in Gbarnga. He financed the construction of a student palava hut and regularly kept in touch. Since that day he had been a mentor in my legal profession. He lectured me at the law school and we continued to share mutual respect irrespective of age, thoughts and beliefs….Today, we mourn his transition to the great beyond but also celebrate his contributions. Rest in peace till we meet again!!”</p>

        <b>‘Best President Liberia Never Had’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nvasekie Konneh says the 2017 election afforded him the opportunity to be around Cllr Brumskine and got to know him more. “From all indications he was a visionary leader and patriot who dearly loved his country and wanted the best for it. He sought the presidency in the three general elections from 2005. In two of those elections he came third and perhaps his best predictable shot at the presidency was 2017. Now that the esteem counsellor has joint our ancestors, we join his family, friends, partisans of Liberty Party and other Liberians in sympathy and pray that his soul rest in eternal peace. Fare you well counsellor. You fought a good fight and you will be missed but remembered well by all true Liberian patriots.”<br/>Thomas Mambu Kolenky expressed deep pains. “Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can’t heal “. Deeply pained to know about the passing away of Liberia’s veteran lawyer and a true nationalist. In him we have not only lost a distinguished lawyer but also a great human who was full of life.”<br/>Julius T Jaesen II wrote: “I believe that Cllr. Brumskine has lived up to this duty to country. His mark on the future of our country is indelible. Therefore, I can only say sleep for eternity, counsel! My prayers are with you Charlyne M. Brumskine. — ￼feeling broken with Charlyne M. Brumskine.”</p>
      <p>Adolphus Teewah recalls an extraordinary statesman and legal luminary. “I remembered our encounter once, through your daughter Charlyne Brumskine at the peace cafe in Sinkor, we had a chat for about a minute and your words of encouragement resonated well in me till now, RIP as you take a bow from the theatre of life to the great beyond. To my friend Charlyne, please take solace in the lord. My deepest condolences to you and the family.”</p>
      <p>Attorney Lamin Kpargoi declared Cllr. Brumskine as the best president Liberia never had whose passing extinguishes the possibility of that country benefiting from the transformation he definitely would have ensured. “Boss man was the term of endearment he and us, who were closest to him, used to refer to each other. Boss man is gone, but the quest for a better Liberia has never been more necessary. My deepest condolences to his wife and children. Rest in peace boss man. The struggle for a better Liberia continues!”</p>
