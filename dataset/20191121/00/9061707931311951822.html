      <h1>Derby mum Nardesh wins at Asian Apprenticeship Awards</h1>
      <h2>Glittering event at Edgbaston Stadium</h2>

      <p>A Derby mum has discovered she can do anything she puts her mind to, as she accepted an award for her commitment to her apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>Nardesh Samra-Burhm was named as the Charity, Voluntary Organisations &amp; Public Services Apprentice of the Year at the <a href="https://asianapprenticeshipawards.co.uk/">Asian Apprenticeship Awards</a> at Edgbaston Stadium in Birmingham. Nardesh works for <a href="https://babington.co.uk/">Babington</a> and is based in Derby.</p>
      <p>Nardesh has come to her apprenticeship as a mature student. For almost 30 years, she has raised two children, as well as working as a project administrator within her family’s consultancy business. After the family spent seven years in Singapore, she took on an administration role at a Derby college. However with her two children embarking on their own careers, Nardesh wanted to gain formal training and qualifications in a project management role.</p>
      <p>She applied for a Programme Support Officer job at <a href="https://babington.co.uk/">Babington</a> in Autumn 2017. Having been out of education for many years, she felt daunted by the prospect of training at college in a classroom setting. Instead she wanted a more ‘hands on’ experience, where she could work in an office environment and develop her skills through real-life projects to make an immediate and positive impact.</p>
      <p>Nardesh began her Associate Project Manager Level 4 programme in December 2017 and is on target to complete her qualification by December 2019. When she first started, Nardesh lacked confidence in her skills as well as navigating the IT systems and software used in the business. In March 2019, she successfully achieved her Functional Skills Maths and English, overcoming years of self-doubt over her abilities by passing first time and living up to the mantra she had always instilled in her own children: “you can do anything, if you put your mind to it!”</p>
      <p>Nardesh has also been very conscious of her status as a role model for mature women in her community. She is passionate about raising the profile of vocational education with women in the Asian community and has worked on a projects to motivate women to embark on training and education to improve their social mobility. As part of <a href="https://babington.co.uk/">Babington</a>’s Staff Volunteering Scheme, Nardesh is planning to work with her local Asian community in Derby, attending the city’s Gurdwara’s to share her experience of apprenticeships and raise aspirations amongst her peers.</p>
      <p>Isa Mutlib is the Director of the <a href="https://asianapprenticeshipawards.co.uk/">Asian Apprenticeship Awards</a>. He commented: “The awards are in the fourth year and the quality of entries gets higher each year. The Awards celebrate the brightest and best British Asian Apprentices and the commitment of their employers and learning providers.</p>
      <p>“Nardesh is a very positive example of someone choosing the apprenticeship route later in her career. She has shown that you can take your previous work and life experience and use it as a stepping stone to career success. Her activities to support other women in her community to consider their options are particularly to be commended. Congratulations to her on winning this award, and I wish her well in her future career.”</p>
      <p>“We hope we have encouraged more British Asians to consider apprenticeships, and more employers to provide opportunities to benefit from the skills that apprentices bring. We are grateful to our headline sponsor, the Royal Air Force, for their support in running the event.”</p>
