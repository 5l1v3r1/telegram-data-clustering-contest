      <h1>Moto2™ and Moto3™ suffer washout on Day 2 in Jerez</h1>
      <h2>Only Joe Roberts in Moto2™ and Deniz Oncu in Moto3™ managed to set a lap time today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dorna Sports</a></address>
      <p>American Racing KTM’s Joe Roberts was the only rider in the Moto2™ class to set a lap on day two of the first 2020 test for the intermediate class. Petronas Sprinta Racing’s Xavi Vierge closed the opening day at the top of the timesheets but further rain throughout the day on Wednesday meant nobody saw any point in riding.</p>
      <p>In the Moto3™ class, rookie Deniz Oncu, riding for the Red Bull KTM Tech 3 squad, was the only rider to set a lap but Romano Fenati also exited pitlane for an out lap aboard the brand-new 2020 Husqvarna, which he will pilot for the Sterilgarda Max Racing squad next year.</p>

      <p>The intermediate and lightweight classes are back in action next week at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia, where they will, without doubt, be hoping for better weather.</p>
