      <p>CAIRO - 21 November 2019: The Petroleum Ministry said Thursday that its program to convert vehicle fueling system from gasoline to compressed natural gas (CNG) achieved "unprecedented results". <br/><br/>This came in a report that was received by Petroleum Minister Tarek el-Molla on natural gas vehicles (NGVs) in Egypt. <br/><br/>According to the report, nearly 17,125 vehicles were converted to bi-fuel vehicles using CNG or LNG (Liquid Natural Gas) from July to October 2019. <br/><br/>Nearly 192 million cubic meters of natural gas were sold for dual-fuel vehicles, the report said. Two fueling stations were opened in September, it added. <br/><br/>A plan has been outlined and a committee was formed in accordance with the prime minister's decision to convert about 147,000 new taxis to natural gas-fueled cars, in addition to the establishment of 366 filling stations to supply these vehicles with CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) within three years starting of January 2020 at the rate of 50,000 vehicles annually. <br/><br/>A cooperation protocol was signed with the National Petroleum Company to add natural gas supply and conversion activity to its service stations. Nearly <br/>20 contracts were signed to implement the first stage of the project.</p>
