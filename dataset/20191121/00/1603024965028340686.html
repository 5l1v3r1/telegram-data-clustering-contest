      <p>"This is a routine process in the course of the investigation", the sources said adding the search operations were conducted at the Rose Valley officer's residence in New Town and the flat of Subhra Kundu, the company chairman's wife, in South City. During the probe several Trinamool Congress leaders had been interrogated and jailed.</p>
      <p>The leaders included TMC MP Sudip Bandopadhyay and MLA Tapas Pal.</p>
      <p>They were granted bail by Odisha High Court as both of them were taken for further questioning to Odisha.</p>
      <p>The ED had also questioned Bengali film personalities like Rituparna Sengupta and Prosenjit Chatterjee for acting in films produced by the Rose Valley group.</p>
