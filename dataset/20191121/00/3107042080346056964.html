      <p>A man who allegedly punched and stomped on a pregnant woman at a western Sydney cafe and left her "emotionally and physically traumatised" will remain behind bars until at least next month.</p>
      <p>Stipe Lozina, 43, appeared before Parramatta Local Court on Thursday charged with affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old woman, who is 38 weeks' pregnant, was with friends at the eatery on Church Street in Parramatta about 10.30pm on Wednesday when Lozina allegedly approached their table.</p>
      <p>After briefly speaking, Lozina allegedly leaned over and punched the victim several times in the head and upper body, causing her to fall to the ground as her friends tried to hold him back. He then allegedly stomped on her head.</p>
      <p>Police say CCTV footage shows one of the woman's friends using a chair to hit the man, causing him to stumble, before other patrons restrained him.</p>
      <p>The woman did not know her alleged attacker but he was known to police.</p>
      <p>Lozina on Thursday was refused bail to next appear on December 5.</p>
      <p>NSW Police Inspector Luke Sywenkyj on Thursday morning said the woman suffered a number of bruises and has some swelling.</p>
      <p>She was taken to Westmead Hospital but was discharged on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"As a result of the assault, she does seem somewhat emotionally and physically traumatised," Insp Sywenkyj told reporters in Sydney.</p>
      <p>"Our police investigation at this stage is still in its infancy but the assault would appear to be completely random and unprovoked."</p>
      <p>Insp Sywenkyj said he wanted to personally commend members of the community for coming to the woman's defence.</p>
      <p>"If it was not for the brave actions of all these members of the community in stopping the assault the victim may very well have sustained much more serious injuries."</p>
