      <p>The legendary Beaujolais wine producer <a href="http://www.duboeuf.com/">Georges Duboeuf</a> released their first Beaujolais Nouveau Rosé last year, and this year in its second vintage it was made by Georges’ 22 year old grandson, Aurelien. Despite Aurelien working hard, everyday, learning every aspect of the business from the ground up, working in the vineyards, cellars and in exports markets, it is fitting that his first official international acknowledgment of his participation in the company is with the vinification of this fun, fresh harvest rosé as it was a project that his father, Franck, had envisioned for a long time.<b>Beaujolais Nouveau</b></p>

      <p>The idea of making a Beaujolais Nouveau wine has been around just as long as farmers have been making wine to celebrate the end of the tough harvesting period. Yet it was Georges Duboeuf, born and raised near the wine region of Beaujolais, who decided to find a way to bottle and preserve the bright fruit flavors that could eventually be shipped around the world starting in the 1960s. While Georges was a proponent of bringing the more serious cru wines from tiny producers to the export market, telling the stories of people who became dear friends, nouveau was just as important in regards to the spirit of Beaujolais that enchanted Georges with their festive parties and strong sense of community. Beaujolais Nouveau, released on the third Thursday of November, became a signal for the world that the holiday season of merriment, connection with those we love, gratitude for the year we survived and the hope for the year to come had begun.</p>

      <p>Knowing that Beaujolais Nouveau is about showing the youthful exuberance of a vintage it seems surprising that the Duboeuf family didn’t make a rosé<b> </b>sooner. But Georges Duboeuf, although embracing the fun of nouveau, takes the wine very seriously as it represents the heart of the people. Like with anything that is extremely successful Beaujolais Nouveau eventually came under attack as time went on with disparaging comments about it being a simple wine that only consisted of sweet fruit flavors (the wine is dry yet fruit dominants the profile) that appealed to the masses. But anyone who is not looking for a fruity, light red wine that can be enjoyed by wine aficionados and wine neophytes alike will not understand nouveau and its idea of bringing people together.</p>
      <p>So when Georges’ son, Franck, suggested making the rosé Georges expressed concern about Beaujolais Nouveau being further criticized; but finally last year Duboeuf made the rosé for the first time and it sold out within a short amount of time. It is a symbol of the personal contributions that Franck has brought to the family business as well as the beginning of his son taking a serious role in the business. Albeit Franck notes that his father, who is in his mid-80s, is still vital to major decisions.</p>

      <p>The 2019 Beaujolais Nouveau, two reds (regular and Beaujolais-Villages) and rosé, was very different from the 2018 that was marked by a easy growing season with high quantity and quality as it was plagued with harsh weather conditions that included frost and hail; Franck estimated the yield to be “just under 25% in relation to the past five years.” But it is not only the top Beaujolais Cru wines that had strict selection but also the grape bunches for Beaujolais Nouveau need to be perfect as the process highlights the pure fruit flavors.</p>

        <b>Generational Change</b>
      </p>
      <p>The generational change at Duboeuf seems to not be so much about reinventing the Beaujolais Nouveau style that Georges Dubeouf brought to the world, as he is always clear that he didn’t invent it but discovered it, but to fully embrace everything that is delightfully joyous about the wine and the next step of following the natural progression of its off-springs such as the rosé. When one takes a step back it seems absurd to apologize or even downplay the value of Beaujolais Nouveau as so many people do enjoy it and it would be a pretty dull world if the only things that existed were bland enough to neither offend nor inspire. Every person wants to get to the point in her life where she is completely comfortable in her own skin and celebrates all the nuances that may sometimes garner critics and it seems Beaujolais Nouveau is reaching that phase in its life; in a nutshell Beaujolais Nouveau is living loud and proud now, no excuses, no apologies, and either it is not someone’s thing or maybe, just maybe, someone decides to join the party to celebrate the idea that no one should have to apologize for what makes her standout.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>2019 Georges Duboeuf, Beaujolais Nouveau:</b> 100% Gamay. Darker fruit notes came out of this 2019 nouveau with black cherries and hints of gravel that had a white pepper finish. Suggested Retail Price: $12.99.</p>
      <p><b>2019 Georges Duboeuf, Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau: </b>100% Gamay. Beaujolais-Villages is the richer version of the nouveau family as it is sourced from villages that have more granite and schist in the terroirs from older vines. More body with richer black and blue fruit notes that carried more weight yet still has that nimble quality that finished with notes of crumbly rock and spice. Suggested Retail Price: $14.99.</p>
