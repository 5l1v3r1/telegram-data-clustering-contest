      <p><a href="https://taftclothing.com/">Taft</a>—the Utah-based, direct-to-consumer men’s shoe brand—managed to rise the ranks in an overcrowded footwear market, gaining a cult following on social media and fans like Ryan Reynolds, Lucky Blue Smith, and Tan France. Top venture capitalists like Fifth Wall and basketball players Dwyane Wade and Andre Iguodala took notice of Taft’s bold designs, bringing outside investment to the brand for the first time in 2018 after earning $20 million in less than four years. Now Taft, which uses materials like suiting wool and woven upholstery fabric is moving into its first brick-and-mortar designed by Bobby Redd at 135 Prince Street in SoHo, one of New York City’s most famed shopping neighborhoods. I quizzed Kory Stevens, Taft’s founder and CEO, about Taft’s rise, its best-sellers, and how the managed to gain a loyal following so fast. <b>How did you come up with the idea for Taft?</b></p>
      <p>Taft started as a men’s no-show sock brand, since I loved beautiful shoes. To showcase the socks, we featured footwear images alongside in ads and on social media. Our unique taste amassed quite a following of shoe-lovers because of that content. A chance post on Reddit about our socks went viral, which lead to us releasing some imagery of shoes I had been designing in my free time. The post resulted in 400 pre-sales overnight. After that we had an emerging footwear business, and haven’t produced another pair of socks since.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>What is your background?</b>
      </p>
      <p>People laugh when I tell them I studied linguistics in college, but there was a time when I was sure I would work for the government as a linguist. I’ve always loved the nuances of language so it was a perfect fit for me. On a personal level, though, I’ve always loved fashion. My mom was a fashion designer when I was growing up, so she was always creating and instilled in me a love of good design. In high school, I started buying and selling shoes on eBay to make some extra money. So I guess my love of shoes really started then. I don’t have any qualifications as a designer, yet designing our shoes has truly become my favorite part of running Taft.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How would you explain Taft's aesthetic?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I would say the Taft aesthetic is updated, urban takes on the classic silhouettes. I’m not re-inventing shoes; I’m just building cool, new versions of the classics. One of my goals when I design is to make the product stand out and be really, really different. Not just another brick in the wall. It seems like when all the other shoe brands out there zig, we zag.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Who is your target market?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When speaking quantitatively, our target market is 25-40 year-old men in big cities. When speaking qualitatively, which I prefer, we are going after the people that want to stand out, be a little different, and take pride in how they dress. People that like attention, people that don’t mind the compliments and the off-the-cuff conversations in the streets about where they got their shoes. Client-facing people that will have eyes on them each day. Those are our people. </p>

        <b>How did you gain a following of celebrities, athletes, and influencers?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’ve always believed that if you start with a great product and give time some space to work it’s magic, good things will inevitably follow. We’ve created a product I’m really proud of, and that resonates with people regardless of socioeconomic or cultural status. Amongst our team, we’ve always said Taft is the party that everyone is invited to, and we mean that, so we’ve made kindness a priority for our brand. We strive to have it permeate everything we do, and I think that resonates with people as well. We love making genuine friendships, whether with a potential customer with 200 followers, or with a famous athlete who loves our shoes. We love good shoes, but we love good people even more. </p>
      <p>
        <b>How did you get NBA stars Dwyane Wade and Andre Iguodala as investors?</b>
      </p>
      <p>That was a lucky break that I can’t take any credit. One of those rare times where you happen to know the exact right person who also knows the exact right person to make it happen. The stars aligned on that one, and as a major sports fan, it’s something I still have to pinch myself about. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are your best-selling styles?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our <a href="https://taftclothing.com/products/the-dragon-boot-in-tobacco?_pos=1&amp;_sid=151f93e0a&amp;_ss=r">Dragon Boots</a> and <a href="https://taftclothing.com/products/the-jack-boot-in-nightfall?_pos=3&amp;_sid=6cea363fa&amp;_ss=r">Jack Boots</a> are our bestsellers but the <a href="https://taftclothing.com/products/the-viking-boot-in-stone?_pos=7&amp;_sid=bf246ab78&amp;_ss=r">Viking Boot in Stone</a> is my personal all-time favorite. </p>

        <b>How did you go about finding the best shoe factories? Why is Spain an ideal place to produce shoes?</b>
      </p>
      <p>This was another area where everything just fell perfectly into place. Back when we were producing socks, but posting pictures of shoes, we started to have a lot of factories reach out to us. We disregarded most of their messages, but when one came through that was particularly impressive we jumped in. I flew out to visit the factory two weeks after my second child was born and we hit it off instantly. We’ve added other factories since, but that original relationship is one that I’m forever grateful for. The members of the factory have become like family. We produce shoes in both Spain and Portugal and for us it was a no-brainer—our factories consist of artisans who were raised in the craft of shoemaking, they learned it from their grandfathers and uncles and take their work seriously. Couple that with the fact that I speak Spanish and it was the perfect fit.</p>
