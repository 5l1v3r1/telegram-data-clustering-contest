      <p><b>Wilfred Ndidi </b>will make his 100th Premier League appearance for Leicester City if he features in Saturday’s home clash against Brighton, Sports Extra reports.</p>
      <p>The Nigeria international will join the elite list of Nigerian players to have made a centurion of appearances in the EPL.</p>
      <p>Nwankwo Kanu, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, Mikel Obi, Joseph Yobo, Victor Moses and Alex Iwobi are the notable Nigerians to have surpasssed the milestone.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old midfielder joined the Foxes from Belgian club, Genk, for £17m in 2016 and has been an integral part of the club, racking in 99 appearances and scoring six times.</p>
      <p>With Leicester, Ndidi has recorded 40 wins and drawn 37, with 13 ending in defeats.</p>
      <p>He made his EPL debut for Leicester City in a 3-0 loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and went on to make 17 appearances in his debut season, scoring twice.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Saturday’s game, Brendan Rodgers extolled Ndidi’s virtues admitting that the former Nath FC player remains a vital part of his team.</p>
      <p>“You can only do that so much when you defend well and you have to be able to press the game,” Rodgers told Leicester City Mercury.</p>
      <p>“From the very top of the pitch from Jamie Vardy, who is tactically so good – he (Ndidi) is that reference to start our press.</p>
      <p>“And then whenever we can, we are tight on our lines and win it.</p>
      <p>“Ndidi is a key part of our game, and he recognises where it looks good but every player collectively has a job to do, on how to read the game and press the game.”</p>
      <p>Leicester City are currently second in the EPL table, eight points behind Liverpool on 26 points.</p>
