      <h1>Coldplay stops touring until concerts are more environmentally friendl</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>British band Coldplay won’t be touring for their new album “Everyday Life” while they take a break to try to develop more environmentally friendly concerts.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it’s not so much taking as giving?” frontman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chris-martin/">Chris Martin</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">told</a> BBC News. “All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job.”</p>
      <p>“We’re taking time over the next year or two, to work out how our tour can not only be sustainable [but] how can it be actively beneficial,” he added.</p>
      <p>Coldplay’s last tour for their 2015 “A Head Full of Dreams” album included 122 shows and spanned five continents.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chris-martin/">Mr. Martin</a> said their goal for the next major tour is to be carbon neutral.</p>

      <p>“Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,” he told the BBC. “We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral.</p>
      <p>“The hardest thing is the flying side of things,” he said. “But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no single use plastic, to have it largely solar powered.”</p>
      <p>Friday’s release of “Everyday Life” will be followed by two concerts on the same day in Amman, Jordan — one at sunrise and one at sunset — which will be broadcast for free on YouTube.</p>
