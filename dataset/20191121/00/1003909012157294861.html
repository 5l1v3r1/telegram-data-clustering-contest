      <p>The UCP government has moved to scrap the former Notley government’s farm and ranch safety legislation, replacing it with a new bill that exempts small farms and ranches from some of the existing rules.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Agriculture Minister Devin Dreeshen introduced the Farm Freedom and Safety Act, a bill that repeals and replaces the former NDP legislation. That legislation, commonly known as Bill 6, was passed by the Notley government in 2016 — when Alberta was the only province in the country where farm and ranch workers didn’t have the same kind of workplace rights and protections as other industries.</p>
      <p>Bill 6 made Occupational Health and Safety rules mandatory for farm employers and extended mandatory WCB coverage to farm and ranch workers. However, the bill quickly incited fury among agricultural producers who feared they would be burdened by red tape, paperwork and rules that don’t reflect the reality of farm life.</p>
      <p>The UCP campaigned on a pledge to scrap the bill, and spent the summer consulting farmers about what it should be replaced with. While the new Farm Freedom and Safety Act will retain existing employment standards rules for large agricultural operations, it will exempt small farms (with five or fewer employees). Farms with five or fewer employees will also be exempt from workplace insurance requirements, while larger farms will have the option of choosing private insurance instead of WCB coverage.</p>
      <p>“We heard from farmers they wanted to have this special consideration for small farms, and that’s where I feel we struck the right balance,” Dreeshen told reporters. “At the end of the day, we got the feedback from farmers and to them . . . that type of regulation, the extra costs they would have to go through, really stresses them on the margins.”</p>
      <p>The UCP is also removing farm and ranch operations from the Labour Relations Code, effectively removing agricultural workers’ right to strike. The NDP had brought agricultural operations under the umbrella of the Labour Relations Code for the first time, but Dreeshen said the move was unnecessary.</p>

      <p>“Farmers would tell us there’s no real place for a union on the farm. And it hasn’t been an issue,” he said. “There’s been no certification of unions on a farm since 2017, when they could have actually had unions. It’s never come up.”</p>
      <p>Tom Steve, general manager of the Alberta Wheat Commission and Alberta Barley, said most farmers will be pleased with the UCP’s bill.</p>
      <p>“Backing away from the more aggressive labour component of the overall approach and focusing more on what the industry really needs is what’s encouraging to us,” he said. “And just turning the page on what was a very unpopular piece of legislation.”</p>
      <p>“This is more of a common-sense approach,” said Kevin Bender, who farms near Sylvan Lake and sits on the board of the Alberta Wheat Commission. He said small farms in particular often hire friends or retired neighbours to get through peak busy periods, and it doesn’t make sense to subject them to the same rules as large industrial operations.</p>
      <p>“There’s certain parameters to agriculture that are different than many other forms of employment or industries,” Bender said. “I think too many of us felt (Bill 6) was a blanket approach.”</p>
      <p>But farm worker advocate Eric Musekamp, co-founder of the Farmworkers’ Union of Alberta, said creating an exemption for small farms sends the message that the rights and protections of those who work on them is not important.</p>
      <p>“We believe that farm workers are the same as and equal to every other Canadian, and we’re entitled under the law to be treated as such,” Musekamp said.</p>
      <p>He added that Alberta’s agriculture industry is suffering from a serious and growing labour shortage, and said the UCP’s bill could have the unwanted effect of compounding that.</p>
      <p>“One of the very big factors in retaining workers is treating them equitably, so if you take away their rights and protections, it makes them not want to work in that sector,” he said.</p>
      <p>NDP Labour critic Christina Gray said the elimination of mandatory WCB coverage is a real concern, in part because having all farm workers covered by WCB meant that workplace injuries and deaths on farms were publicly tracked and reported.</p>
      <p>“It gave us the information we need to then proactively go into workplaces and improve health and safety,” Gray said. “But now not all injury information will be available, in part because some workers won’t be covered at all and in part because some workers will be covered under private insurance.”</p>
