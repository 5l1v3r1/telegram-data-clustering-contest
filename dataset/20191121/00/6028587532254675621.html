      <p>French hoteliers are up in arms over the new partnership between the International Olympics Committee (IOC) and Airbnb, which they say is unjust.</p>

      <h3>The partnership between the IOC and Airbnb offers “guaranteed” accommodation at Olympic events</h3>
      <p>During the upcoming Olympic events–Tokyo 2020, Beijing 2022, Paris 2024, Milan 2026, Los Angeles 2028–Airbnb will offer “guaranteed” accommodation in a deal <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d5e5684-09d0-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">reportedly worth $500 million by the <i>Financial Times</i></a>, although the real value has not been disclosed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sofialottopersio/2019/11/18/airbnb-olympic-partnership-ahead-ipo/#7394eb9b57a1"><i>Forbes</i> reported</a> that the move is in line with current Airbnb strategy to become a key partner in large-scale events, where building hotels to host millions of people just for a few weeks is unfeasible. It’s a timely move for Airbnb–worth $31 billion–who announced plans in September to float an IPO.</p>

      <h3>French hoteliers have responded angrily</h3>
      <p>France is hosting the Olympic games in 2024 in Paris and its hoteliers are not happy that Airbnb has been given such status. The UMIH (Union des Métiers et des Industries de l’Hotellerie), the major organization representing Parisian hotels and restaurants, issued a public statement slamming the decision.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/services-conseils/jo-2024-outres-par-le-partenariat-dairbnb-les-hoteliers-suspendent-leur-participation-1149599">Quoted in French business newspaper <i>Les Echos</i></a><i>,</i> the president of UMIH, Roland Héguy, who was at its annual conference in Biarritz, called the partnership “disrespectful to hotel industry professionals” <a href="https://twitter.com/UMIH_France/status/1197104463212924928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197104463212924928&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesechos.fr%2Findustrie-services%2Fservices-conseils%2Fjo-2024-outres-par-le-partenariat-dairbnb-les-hoteliers-suspendent-leur-participation-1149599">on Twitter</a> and declared its organization “was surprised.”</p>
      <h3>French hoteliers have declared they will no longer be involved in Olympic planning</h3>
      <p>In a joint statement, the president of the National Group of Hotel Chains (CNG), Jean-Virgile Crance, and the president of the Hotels division for UMIH, Laurent Duc, both organizations called the partnership, “untimely” and claimed it was outrageous to make Airbnb a partner of the IOC when it advocated deregulation around the world.</p>
      <p>Laurent Duc said that UMIH members had already earmarked 40,000 rooms for athletes and spectators, rendering the Airbnb partnership unnecessary. In response to the announcement, the UMIH will suspend its involvement in the preparation meetings taking place for the Parisian Olympic games.</p>

      <h3>The partnership puts added pressure on the relationship between Airbnb and Paris’ city hall</h3>
      <p>One of the main tenets of the 9-year partnership between Airbnb and the IOC is that it allows Airbnb key advertising opportunities across the cities where Olympic events are being held.</p>
      <p>This would exacerbate the already tense relationship between Airbnb and Paris City Hall, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2019/10/06/airbnb-and-its-second-largest-global-market-can-france-rein-the-travel-giant-in/#266541867c89">which is fighting the sharing platform for its role in rising rents, lack of affordable housing and allowing people to flout city taxes</a>.</p>
      <p>Airbnb and the UMIH have both been contacted for comment.</p>
