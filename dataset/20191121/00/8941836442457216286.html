      <h1>Divisive Democrats in D.C. City Hall?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/deborah-simmons/" target="_blank">Deborah Simmons</a></address>

        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The field of Democrats running to kick President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> out of the White House was as divisive as ever Wednesday in the Land of Tyler Perry, whose newly minted entertainment compound in Atlanta hosted the presidential candidates’ debate.</p>
      <p>“The Generals” — Sen. Bernard Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — took on each other regarding health care, while Sen. Kamala Harris sounding like a Washington Redskins cheerleader, admonishing voters to root, root, root for the home team … the Democrats, that is.</p>
      <p>What all 10 Dems seem to forget to remember is that “all politics is local,” as Tip O’Neill espoused in a partisan 1982 reelection bid for the U.S. House.</p>
      <p>Instead, the major media help prove the far-left is precisely that, and with each debate and each impeachment hearing proving that the far-left is turning on itself.</p>
      <p>Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the doyenne of Left Coast liberalism as the Speaker of the House, first didn’t want a quick vote on the impeachment of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a>. Yet, here we are with a fresh take on daytime soap operas — sans Ivory soap commercials.</p>

      <p>Leave it to a D.C. politician to pick up on the far left’s scent. As if Ms. Pelosi had handed him a rod and staff, D.C. Council member David Grosso appears to be training for a run against the chairman of the council.</p>
      <p>His major beef? Quid pro quo. No joke.</p>
      <p>Mr. Grosso claims that Chairman Phil Mendelson promised Mr. Grosso could hold onto his chairmanship of the Education Committee if he voted to repeal Initiative 77, the ballot measure that voters had approved to increase the minimum wage for tipped workers.</p>
      <p>Well, the council approved the repeal and Mr. Grosso remains chairman of the Education Committee — and he’s publicly bad-mouthing Mr. Mendelson. But that’s a distraction.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Mr. Mendelson is a progressive. Mr. Grosso is a progressive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mendelson runs citywide for the chairman’s seat. Mr. Grosso runs citywide for his at-large seat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mendelson is a Democrat. Mr. Grosso is a Democrat who disguises himself as an independent in order to maintain his seat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grosso’s political problem is twofold: 1) He said he’s not seeking reelection in 2020, and 2) D.C. voters have never elected an independent as council chair or mayor or congressional delegate.</p>
        <p>Though you can’t tell from the debates, the Democrats really do provide a united front: They’re united on one issue, and that issue is named <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>.</p>
        <p>When it comes to local politics, Mr. Grosso is a prime example of what happens when Democrats unmask themselves. They become divisive — and the lone man out when there’s a race afoot.</p>
