      <p>Humana’s continued shift from fee-for-service medicine to value-based payments for physicians is shaving more costs for seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, the insurer says, citing an annual new internal study.Medical costs were 20% lower for seniors enrolled in Humana Medicare Advantage plans that paid physicians via value-based models in 2018 compared to costs of those in traditional fee-for service Medicare, the Louisville-based insurer’s study, released Thursday showed. Humana said that percentage reduction translates to “$3.5 billion in avoided covered medical expense that would have been incurred had patients been enrolled in original Medicare.”</p>
      <p>The study comes as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/06/18/private-medicare-advantage-could-hit-70-market-share/#50eaaa6720ca">more Americans flock to Medicare Advantage plans</a>, thanks in part to new rules that allow them to cover more supplemental benefits. Medicare Advantage plans contract with the federal government to provide extra benefits and services to seniors, such as disease management and nurse help hotlines, with some even providing vision and dental care and wellness programs. The new supplemental benefits in some plans include ride-sharing, telehealth connections to doctors and other added coverage.</p>
      <p>Humana and other health insurers are also stepping up their efforts to document reduced expenses and improved quality for seniors enrolled in private Medicare Advantage as some Democrats running for their party’s nomination for President like U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders want to uproot the private insurer’s role in administering any government-subsidized health benefits.</p>
      <p>But health insurers say it’s these extra benefits and coordinated care orchestrated by private health insurers that encourages health plan members to get better care upfront in a doctor’s office or other low-cost settings. Therefore, that is helping reduce costs, the report indicates. “Prevention screenings, improved medication adherence and effective management of patient treatment plans all contributed to creating a 20.1% reduction in medical cost between Humana’s MA value-based care programs and expenses associated with Original Medicare’s fee-for-service model,” the report said.</p>
      <p>Humana’s report also outlined 27% fewer hospital admissions and 14.6% fewer emergency rooms visits for health plan members whose doctors were paid via value-based models when compared to original fee-for-service Medicare.  </p>
      <p>“The Medicare Advantage plan serves as a rich laboratory for value-based care, as it allows for integrated and coordinated management of chronic conditions, and a holistic view of the patient,” <a href="https://www.humana.com/provider/news/publications/humana-your-practice/humana-welcomes-new-cmo">Humana’s chief medical officer, Dr. William Shrank,</a> said in a statement accompanying the new report.</p>
      <p>But the health insurer said medical care providers need to buy into these new models for them to be successful.</p>
      <p>“Moving the industry forward with a focus on value is not something we can do alone,” Shrank said. “Our dialogue with physicians, community organizations and other health care providers is essential to developing a sustainable system that improves population health and reduces costs for everyone.”</p>
