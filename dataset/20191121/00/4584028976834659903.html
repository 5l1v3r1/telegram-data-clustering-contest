      <p>Ben Stokes is the scalp most prized by Neil Wagner after the England batsman finished day one of the first Test with New Zealand on 67 not out.</p>
      <p>The tourists overcame a slow start and recovered from 120-3 to reach 241-4 by the close at Bay Oval.</p>
      <p>Stokes – described by Wagner as "a bit of a freak" – was key to their revival, compiling his timely knock patiently as he faced 114 balls, sending nine to the boundary rope.</p>
      <p>The all-rounder has proven a thorn in the Black Caps' side before, most notably in a superlative display at the Cricket World Cup final in July.</p>
      <p>And left-arm seamer Wagner is determined not to give Stokes any more footage for his ever-expanding highlights reel.</p>
      <p>"Ben is that sort of a player," said Wagner. "He is a special talent and he is a bit of a freak at times.</p>
      <p>"For us, everyone wants to get him out because you know how important a wicket he is."</p>
      <p>At the top of the order, Rory Burns made a half century but could have been sent packing with only 10 runs to his name when he appeared to edge Trent Boult.</p>
      <p>However, the appeal was tame and dismissed, with no review taken, which proved a mistake – although an understandable one, according to Wagner.</p>
      <p>"It's quite a tough ground. There was another one that sounded like a nick and was nowhere near the bat," he explained.</p>
      <p>"When it's windy – and you don't always feel that from the grass banks – it's quite hard to hear those things.</p>
      <p>"There was a little bit of a noise [for the Burns chance] but it was a bob each way; [sometimes] you want to take that risk but also you want to keep hold of them for when you do need them."</p>
