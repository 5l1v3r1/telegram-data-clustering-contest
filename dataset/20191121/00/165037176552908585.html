        <b>Pep Guardiola has once again been linked to Bayern Munich in the last few days. According to 'Kicker', the Spanish coach would opt for a year out rather than returning to German football.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>When Guardiola cuts ties, it's usually forever. </b>Already based in <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>,<b> Pep has the most difficult task yet</b> in trying to surpass a very comfortable first placed Liverpool. Beyond sporting performance, many are wondering <b>what will become of his future.</b></p>
      <p>With the recent departure of<b> Niko Kovac from Bayern Munich,</b> Germany has come link Guardiola with<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/bayern-munchen/"> Bayern Munich</a> once again, raising the possibility of<b> a return to the Allianz Arena.</b></p>

      </ul>
      <p>However, as shown by 'Kicker', this is not something very realistic...<b> atleast not in the coach's mind.</b> Whether or not he stays at City, he has<b> no intention of returning to the Bundesliga.Â </b></p>
      <p>In fact, as this source states, he would rather opt for a year out to try to put his mind at rest and<b> renew ideas for future projects.</b></p>
      <p>Months ago he said he'd like to be able to <b>coach a national team someday</b>. Who knows if Pep's next adventure has to do with putting himself at the helm of a national team...</p>
