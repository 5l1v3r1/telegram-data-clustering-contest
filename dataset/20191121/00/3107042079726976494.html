      <p>An Omakau man who stole $85,000 from his disabled brother over 10 years acted out of ''greed'' and has destroyed family relationships, the Alexandra District Court has heard.</p>
      <p>Christopher David Boks-Wilson (62) appeared before Judge Emma Smith yesterday, charged with theft by a person in a special relationship in Alexandra between July 4, 2008 and November 30, 2018.</p>
      <p>Boks-Wilson cared for his brother after he had been injured in a car crash in 2008 and during that time was in charge of his brother's finances.</p>
      <p>He spent his brother's earnings on various items during that time, including motor vehicles and parts. He also broke 27 term deposits and took money from cash machines.</p>
      <p>Crown solicitor Craig Power said his motive was ''purely for greed''.</p>
      <p>Mr Power said Boks-Wilson could not offer a reason for his behaviour and instead blamed his victim for his offending.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyer Justine Baird said that was not the case - ''he did care for his brother'' and made sure his brother ''didn't miss out on anything''.</p>
      <p>''He's not blaming his brother and he knows what he did was wrong.''</p>
      <p>Boks-Wilson had also bought items his brother needed.</p>
      <p>Judge Smith said the victim had been able to function normally up until the car crash and had been employed and ''saved a substantial amount'' throughout his working life.</p>
      <p>''He had achieved financial stability and had money invested in term deposit accounts. He became completely reliant on people closest to him. What your victim did was entrust you to take care of his financial affairs.''</p>
      <p>She said the impact of Boks-Wilson's offending on his family had been high.</p>
      <p>''You have destroyed familiar relationships, potentially beyond repair''.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to 12 months' home detention, ordered to pay $85,000 reparation and $130 court costs.</p>
