      <h1>Police Reports: Meth, Heroin, Cocaine Found at Tesla Factory</h1>

      <h3>Giggedy</h3>
      <p>Enigmatic entrepreneur Elon Musk apologized to SpaceX employees after he puffed a joint on-air with Joe Rogan, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-apologized-spacex-smoking-weed">claiming in a mass email</a> that “SpaceX maintains a drug free workplace<i>.”</i></p>
      <p>But according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1197313164402020354">cache of police reports</a> obtained by government transparency group PlainSite, the Nevada “Gigafactory” operated by Tesla — Musk’s other venture — is anything but drug-free.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Drugs</h3>
      <p>The reports, obtained from police in Storey County, Nevada, describe an environment in which workers repeatedly left drugs out in the open.</p>
      <p>One report, titled “Possible Heroin,” <a href="https://twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1197326480734220288/photo/1">describes</a> a “brown square” found on the floor of a Tesla restroom. Another <a href="https://twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1197318371596857345/photo/1">tells of</a> a “small pouch,” found near a workstation, filled with a white powder that tested positive for cocaine. Another <a href="https://twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1197348836059930625/photo/1">recounts</a> an incident involving a bag containing methamphetamine and a pipe, also found in a restroom.</p>
      <p>Not all the reports are related to narcotics. One <a href="https://twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1197313164402020354/photo/1">disturbing report</a> describes how a commercial truck pulled out of the Tesla facility and hit a horse, injuring it so badly that the officer had to kill the animal with a shotgun.</p>
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>Let’s be clear: Tesla employs tens of thousands of workers, so it’s statistically reasonable that a handful would run into trouble with the law.</p>
      <p>Still, the newly released documents aren’t the first signs that Tesla has had trouble with drugs — last year, a former Tesla employee <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/the-dea-says-it-would-not-have-notified-tesla-of-an-ongoing">alleged that</a> the electric carmaker failed to disclose a federal investigation into a drug<b>–</b>trafficking operation at the same Nevada factory.</p>
      <p>Tesla didn’t reply to a request for comment. We’ll update if they get back.</p>
