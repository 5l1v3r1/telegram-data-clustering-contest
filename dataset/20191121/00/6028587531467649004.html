      <h1>Why Has A.O. Smith Stock Rallied And What To Expect From The Company?</h1>

      <p>A.O. Smith (NYSE: AOS), a maker of water heaters and boilers, saw its stock price rally by close to 15% over the last month. While the stock has seen significant volatility this year, on account of the headwinds in the Chinese business and higher steel prices, there have been some positive trends in recent months. Firstly, the company’s Q3 results were largely in-line with expectations, as it benefited from a reasonably strong performance in North America, where sales were up 6%, driven by demand for commercial water heaters and boilers, with margins also trending higher. Separately, the company has increased its share repurchases and dividend this year and this is likely a positive sign for investors.We ‘step back’ from these recent swings to review A.O. Smith’s performance over the last few years, as a context for what might come next.
