      <p>Recently, the VP of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) posted <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201911/rnoti-p1778.pdf">an essay</a> arguing that the implementation of policies requiring applicants for faculty positions to submit Diversity Statements constitutes a method for screening candidates based on their <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/politics">politics</a>.</p>

      <p>This is just the most recent in a rising tide of intolerant academic outrage mobs. I've written about this problem for <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rabble-rouser/201708/the-psychology-the-new-mccarthyism">Psychology Today here</a>.</p>

        <figcaption>Source: Lee Jussim</figcaption>

      <p>I have also written about this for <a href="https://areomagazine.com/2018/03/17/the-reality-of-the-rise-of-an-intolerant-and-radical-left-on-campus/">AreoMagazine here.</a> To be sure, these essays are not intended as a general indictment of the liberal or reasonable left, nor is it vindication of views one sometimes finds on the right (especially, the extreme right), including but not restricted to white supremacy and ethnonationalism. My point is not about politics or ideology at all. It is about intolerance and willingness to attempt to punish and sanction people for expressing views with which one disagrees or opposes.</p>
      <p>Below you will find two things: 1. Examples of mathematicians on Twitter trying to gin up an outrage mob to punish Thompson for expressing her views about the politicized nature of diversity statements; and 2. My letter to the AMS supporting her.</p>

      <p>To the American Mathematical Society,</p>
      <p>I endorse Abigail's statement that appeared in Volume 66, #11 of Notices of the American Mathematical Society. Even if I did not endorse it, I would strongly endorse her right to publish something with which I disagreed, without <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/punishment">punishment</a> triggered by protests or outrage mobs, including outrage mobs of academics.</p>
      <p>Although I am speaking entirely for myself, I have chaired my Department's Diversity Committee, and, currently, I am Chair of the Psychology Department at Rutgers Committee, and, currently, I am Chair of the Psychology Department at Rutgers University. Through these positions, I have had more than ample opportunity to initiate practices that advance diversity.</p>
      <p>For example, as Chair, I have arranged for our Diversity Committee to play a proactive role in faculty hiring by assisting all search committees. We also recently submitted a proposal to our administration to create a new postdoctoral position in order to facilitate creating a pipeline of scholars who will advance the diversity of the faculty here and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I say this to communicate to you that this is not some thinly veiled attempt to oppose diversity efforts. Far from it. Regardless, Thompson's essay is an eloquent description of how, whether intentional or not, implementation of required Diversity Statements at universities constitutes a political litmus test for hiring. Universities should not be in the business of requiring applicants to meet political litmus tests.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Thompson is wrong in believing this. Perhaps I am wrong, as well, for agreeing with her view. Even if that is the case, academia is the last place on Earth where someone should be sanctioned or punished for expressing objections to policies and practices on any grounds, including but not restricted to political ones.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Lee Jussim</p>
      <p>Distinguished Professor and Chair</p>
      <p>Rutgers Psychology</p>
      <p>————————————————————————————————</p>
      <p>I have a sincere Diversity Statement that I chose to put online at Rutgers, which you can find <a href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/lee-jussim/diversity-statement/">here</a>. I am pretty sure I was the first Rutgers Psych Professor to have such a statement. This was by my choice, no one urged or pressured me to do it. Rutgers has a very demographically diverse student body, and it is genuinely important to me that students know that, regardless of their racial, ethnic, political, religious or other <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/identity">identity</a> background, they are welcome here and in my lab.</p>
      <p>However, I also respect faculty who would rather not provide a diversity statement. People who strive for excellence in their field of expertise, say, teaching and research for many academics, should not be excluded from positions because they are not sufficiently fluent in the lingo of social justice.</p>

      <p>I also have one <a href="https://quillette.com/2019/02/24/my-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-statement/">here</a>, in which I point out the politicized nature of such required statements. Here are some excerpts:</p>
      <p>I am not afraid of Social Justice.</p>
      <p>I am afraid of those who will punish others for not subscribing to a toxic and oppressive view of social justice. I am afraid, not of actual social justice, but of what some people are willing to do, and are in fact now doing, in the name of social justice.</p>
      <p>This reads almost like a prediction for what is happening to Thompson.</p>

      <p>I think you have come to the same conclusion as I have. I'm more afraid of the permanent consequences of not fighting back against justice mobs than the temporary blowback of fighting them.</p>
      <p>The justice mobs are actually small in number but very vocal and in my opinion, very Cluster B. More disturbing is the silence of the rational majority.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Anonymous on November 21, 2019 - 7:35pm</p>
      <p>What concerns me in addition to having a political litmus test, is the worthlessness of such statements. People either sign out of expediency or sign and consider that sufficient. If you want to support diversity, get to know those who are different from you as individuals, not as representatives of a group. Read opinions you disagree with. Listen to those you disagree with or don't understand with a goal to better understand their perspective, not just long enough to formulate arguments to counter theirs.</p>
      <p>It is fine to reach different conclusions from others, but we need the humility to realize that life is too complex for anyone to be completely right or wrong. Finally, don't assume you know why those you disagree with think differently about an issue. If you would find it offensive for someone to tell you why you hold an opinion, so do those you disagree with.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by John on November 21, 2019 - 8:30pm</p>
      <p>There is a video on Youtube titled, "Susan Buchanan: "You stop it, you are a white male!".</p>
      <p>It shows a recent meeting of the trustees of Oak Park, Illinois. The business at hand was to update the board's diversity statement.</p>
      <p>In the video, Susan Buchanan literally tells two white male colleagues that they don't get to have an opinion on the subject, and to "shut up".</p>
      <p>Buchanan's rant is as follows: I don't want to hear what you have to say." "You shouldn't have an opinion on that. That is the point. Why do you have an opinion on equity?" "You have been white from birth," Buchanan told fellow trustees Dan Moroney and Deno Andrews. "Why are you arguing what is a system of oppression? You've never experienced one, so shut up! I don't want to hear from you! Just stop Dan, just stop Deno. You are not oppressed and people in Oak Park and we are trying to recognize that as a community."</p>
      <p>One of the proponents of "diversity" just showed what diversity is really all about: excluding those who are white and male.</p>
      <p>I would have told Ms. Buchanan about how I met with the minister several times to get my conscientious objector paperwork in order - something she never had to think about - as well as my employment settlement for black racism.</p>
