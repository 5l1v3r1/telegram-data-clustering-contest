      <p><b>CLEVELANDÂ (AP)</b> - Authorities say a woman repeatedly stabbed another at an Ohio church for wearing fur.</p>
      <p>Cleveland Heights police say 35-year-old Meredith Lowell stabbed the victim in the arm and abdomen Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Police say a man wrestled Lowell to the floor and held her until officers arrived. The victim remained hospitalized Thursday. Her condition was unclear.</p>
      <p>Officials say the victim had taken children she was babysitting to a Presbyterian church for choir practice.</p>
      <p>Police Chief Anne Mecklenburg says Lowell was previously charged with a knife attack on someone wearing fur last November in neighboring University Heights. That case is pending.</p>
      <p>A telephone number to seek comment from Lowell's attorney couldn't be found.</p>
