      <h1>How Arsenal could line up against Southampton</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a> will be looking to return to winning ways when they host <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/southampton/"><b>Southampton</b></a> on Saturday afternoon.</h2>

      <p>The Gunners are currently on a five-game winless run in all competitions, while they have not been victorious in the Premier League since <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/result/result-david-luiz-scores-first-arsenal-goal-in-win-over-bournemouth_374223.html">beating Bournemouth</a> at the start of October.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a>'s side will enter this weekend's matches in sixth position in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">the table</a>, some eight points off fourth-placed Manchester City on the same number of games.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how the capital side could line up at the Emirates Stadium.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dani-ceballos/"><b>Dani Ceballos</b></a> (hamstring)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sead-kolasinac/"><b>Sead Kolasinac</b></a> (hamstring)</p>
      <p>Arsenal will again be without the services of Dani Ceballos due to a hamstring problem, while Sead Kolasinac faces a late test on the hamstring issue he picked up on international duty.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kieran-tierney/"><b>Kieran Tierney</b></a> could therefore come into the side at left-back, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/granit-xhaka/"><b>Granit Xhaka</b></a> is in line to return to the squad for the first time since being booed off the field by the Arsenal fans against Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Emery has revealed that the Switzerland international is now ready to return and a call on his possible inclusion will be made after Friday's training session.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mesut-ozil/"><b>Mesut Ozil</b></a> could again join <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alexandre-lacazette/"><b>Alexandre Lacazette</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pierre-emerick-aubameyang/"><b>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</b></a> in an attacking position, while it would not be a surprise to see <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nicolas-pepe/"><b>Nicolas Pepe</b></a> return to the starting side.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lucas-torreira/"><b>Lucas Torreira</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matteo-guendouzi/"><b>Matteo Guendouzi</b></a> should continue in the middle of the park, although Emery is likely to ditch the 3-4-3 formation that struggled against Leicester City last time out in favour of a 4-3-3.</p>
