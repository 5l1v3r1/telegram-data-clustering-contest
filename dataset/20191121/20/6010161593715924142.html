      <p>Rocket League will no longer contain loot boxes or keys when the next update goes live.</p>
      <p>Loot boxes and keys will disappear in Rocket League when the game’s update goes live on December 4.</p>
      <p>As we previously told you, crates and keys <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/02/rocket-league-blueprints-credit-system-replaces-loot-boxes-and-keys/">will be replaced by Blueprints and Credits</a>.</p>
      <p>Once the update is live, players will also be able to browse and purchase a rotating selection of <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/news/the-item-shop--a-closer-look/">in-game items with the new Item Shop</a>. The Item Shop will include all types of in-game items like Painted Cars, Player Banners, Exotic Wheels, Goal Explosions and more which can be purchased with credits.</p>
      <p>Keys that are still in your inventory on the day of the update will be converted to 100 credits. These can then be used in the shop to build items from Blueprints or upgrade to Rocket Pass Premium. You can buy packs of credits just like you could Keys, plus you can earn them in Rocket Pass Premium.</p>
