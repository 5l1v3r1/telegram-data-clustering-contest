      <p><b>(CNN) -</b> If you haven't seen the final season of 'Game of Thrones' and plan to - we suggest clicking out of this story. There are spoilers ahead.</p>
      <p>The finale left many fans dismayed. How could Jon Snow be sent back beyond the Wall? And Bran as king?</p>
      <p>If you yearned for another ending, there's good news. One of the stars of the show told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/game-thrones-cast-filmed-alternative-ending-season-8-well-never-see-reveals-tormund-star-kristofer-hivju-11179830/">metro.co.uk</a> that they shot one.</p>
      <p>Kristofer Hivju, who played Tormund Giantsbane in the HBO series, teased an alternate ending in an interview, but he kept mum about the storyline.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian actor said the other ending was actually shot, but a representative for HBO suggested to CNN that Hivju made the whole thing up as a joke.</p>
      <p>Sounds like something people in Westeros would be sent beyond the Wall for.</p>
