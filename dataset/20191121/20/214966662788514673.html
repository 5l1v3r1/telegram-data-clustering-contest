      <p>Teens appear to be putting on their best behaviour as Schoolies celebrations begin to come to an end on the Gold Coast.</p>
      <p>Police say they were pleased with the “overall behaviour” of the large crowd that headed into the Surfers Paradise CBD overnight.</p>
      <p>Just three male schoolies were arrested on eight charges, which were mostly in relation to public nuisance and drug possession offences.</p>
      <p>It was a great improvement on the same night last year, which saw 11 schoolies arrested.</p>
      <p>Three non-schoolies were also taken into custody overnight on 6 charges.</p>
      <p>The toolies were busted mainly for public nuisance and drug related offences.</p>
      <p>It was a busier night for paramedics however, with 68 schoolies treated at the on-site Emergency Treatment Centre.</p>
      <p>33 females and 35 males were assessed, with six requiring further assessment at hospital.</p>
      <p>The final night of schoolies begins tonight.</p>
