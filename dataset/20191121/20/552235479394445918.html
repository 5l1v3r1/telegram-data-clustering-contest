      <p>A knife thug who stabbed a man in the buttock during a gala day clash has been told he faces a prison sentence.</p>
      <p>Lewis Findlay was found guilty after trial of assaulting Connor McClung to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/whitburn">Whitburn</a> Gala Day in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/west-lothian">West Lothian</a> on 23 June last year.</p>
      <p>A jury at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Livingston Sheriff Court</a> returned a majority verdict convicting him of serious assault and unanimously found him guilty of possessing a knife in a public place.</p>
      <p>He was cleared of assaulting another man, Peter Brown, by striking him on the chest with a knife to the danger of his life after the jury found the charge not proven.</p>
      <p>He was earlier acquitted of causing a drunken disturbance by brandishing a wooden pole and damaging a wall at a house in High Academy Street in nearby Armadale the same day after the prosecution withdrew the charge.</p>
      <p>Findlay, 20, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/whitburn">Whitburn</a> , who had denied all the charges, wept in the dock as the jury’s verdicts were read out. </p>
      <p>Sheriff Kenneth Maciver called for background reports and told Findlay to return to court for sentence next year.</p>
      <p>He warned the accused: “You now stand convicted of charges for being in possession of a knife and for stabbing an individual with that knife.</p>
      <p>“You should understand that you face custody for that. Be in no doubt about that.</p>
      <p>“In spite of that I’m satisfied that your bail should be continued until a report is ready and you are sentenced and that will be on 6 January.”</p>
