      <p>LARGO, Fla. â€” A Largo veteran and widower was in for a special surprise on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Neighbors gave Bruce Bird a very special gift. He served in Vietnam in the late 60s.</p>

      <p>Bird was also a purple heart recipient along with many other awards and honors.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Bird received a Quilt of Valor. It's given to wounded service members and veterans all over the nations.</p>
      <p>"Just so honored to have it presented to me," Bird said.</p>
      <p>Bird's family up north nominated him for the quilt, but they could not be there for the event.</p>

      <p>His wife died just before Christmas in 2018. So, when Bird's neighbor Betty Sharp found out he was nominated, she rallied the troops in their mobile home park.</p>
      <p>"I'm very proud of him and I had at one point four brothers in service, so I know what it would mean to them," Sharp said.</p>
      <p>Bird said it meant the world to have his friends and neighbors there to support those who served and continue to serve.</p>
      <p>"Glad that people appreciate other service men that served their country to give you something like this," Bird said.</p>
