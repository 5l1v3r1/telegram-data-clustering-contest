      <p>A young healthcare worker from Queensland has become Australia’s newest multi-millionaire after scooping the entire $40 million jackpot overnight.</p>
      <p>The shocked Cairns man held the only division one winning entry nationally, and also managed to nab division two 19 times, bolstering his total prize to a whopping $40,430,542.90.</p>
      <p>After realising he had won, the man admitted all he could think of to celebrate was to take a… shower.</p>
      <p>“I thought I would check my ticket before bed. I was quite calm. I knew I had some of the numbers and thought I might have won division six,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Then I had another look and thought ‘no, you b******s are wrong!’. I had a look again. Then I went and had a shower.”</p>
      <p>The winner credited his beloved cat for alerting him to the confirmation call from Golden Casket.</p>
      <p>“It feels fantastic. It’s still very hard to accept, but you’ve rung me now so it must be true,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Actually, when the phone rang, my cat ran over to the phone. She never does that. I was really surprised. That’s why I answered the phone.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to believe only one person won it and that one person is me!</p>
      <p>“It’s amazing. You dream about these things but when it happens you don’t believe it.”</p>
      <p>The happy man, who wishes to remain anonymous, says he will sharing the prize money with family.</p>
      <p>“I’ll be sharing this with my family. I will buy a new house and go on holidays. I think I’m going to retire early too,” he said.</p>
      <p>The winning numbers in Thursday’s Powerball draw were 1, 12, 3, 2, 25, 13 and 23 and the lucky Powerball was number 1.</p>
