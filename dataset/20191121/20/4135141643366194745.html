        <i>Welcome to the 2019-20 edition of the Bucks Weekly Spotlight. Each Thursday we’ll track the progress of the players who are trying to help Milwaukee make a championship run, give updates on other players from the previous week and sometimes take a look at who is lighting it up for the Wisconsin Herd.</i>

      <p>
        <i>This is the 3rd edition of the 2019-20 Bucks Weekly Spotlight</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>SPOTLIGHT ON …</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Center Brook Lopez</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lopez garnered a lot of notice for his 3-point shooting last season. For good reason.</p>
      <p>Lopez made 187 3s last season, eclipsing his career high by more than 50 and setting a record for a 7-footer. He’s still putting up 3-pointers this year, making at least one in 13 of Milwaukee’s first 14 games, including all four of the Bucks’ games last week, entering Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The ability for the big man to hit from outside (often way outside) earned Lopez the nickname “Splash Mountain.”</p>
      <p>But don’t forget the latter half of that nickname. Lopez is stepping up in blocked shots and also to a lesser degree rebounding.</p>
      <p>In Milwaukee’s four games last week, Lopez had 12 blocks, including two games with five (at Indiana and at Chicago).</p>
      <p>That gives him four games already with 5+ blocks this season in just 14 games. Last season, Lopez had a career-high seven games with 5+ blocks … in 81 games.</p>
      <p>Lopez was fourth in the NBA in blocks per game last season with 2.2. He’s third this season at 2.4, and also is third in block percentage at 7.8% (last season: 6.5%, fourth in NBA) and second in blocks (34).</p>
      <p>Playing slightly fewer minutes than last year (28.7 to 26.9), Lopez’s blocks per 36 is 3.3. He’s topped 2.5 just once in his career – 2.8 in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Lopez isn’t the rebounder he was during his younger days, in part because he spends a lot more time on the outside, but his 5.1 rebounds per game average and 9.3 total rebounding % are his best rates since 2016-17.</p>
      <p>He’s also had two double-digit rebounding games, including 10 against the Bulls this past Monday. Earlier this season, on Nov. 6 at the L.A. Clippers, Lopez pulled down 12 boards, his highest total in a game since the 2015-16.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BUCKSHOTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in Giannis: 32.5 points, 12.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 2.0 steals and 1.0 blocks while shooting 60.0% from the field over Milwaukee’s four games. Antetokounmpo has a double-double in every game and has a streak of 10 straight games with 25+ points and 10+ rebounds. Since Giannis entered the league in 2013-14, only Kevin Love from Jan. 29-Feb. 25, 2014 has had a longer streak – 11. This century, only one other player has a longer streak than Love – Shaquille O’Neal, who did it in 13 games over two seasons from March 26-Oct. 30, 2001. With stats available back to 1983-84, only Karl Malone, who did it in 15 games over two seasons in 1988 and in 10 games in 1992, have reached a double-figure streak in 25+-point, 10+-rebound games.</p>
      <p>— Eric Bledsoe’s streak of double-digit scoring games ended at eight, but he rebounded with a 28-point effort Wednesday at Atlanta. He also had a season-high 31 points on Nov. 14 vs. Chicago.</p>
      <p>— After scoring six points combined in four games from Nov. 6-14 , Donte DiVincenzo has put up games of 14, 15 and 11 points. He connected on 55.6% of his shots in those three contests including 43.8$ from 3.</p>
      <p>— Sterling Brown might have only average 6.5 points over 22.7 minutes per game last week, but his box score +/- of 57 (14.3 average) was highest on the Bucks over that span.</p>
      <p>— Cameron Reynolds, who is on a two-way contract, averaged 21.3 points as the Wisconsin Herd won all three of their games last week. The Herd are 5-1 on the year; in 2018-19 they won just 12 games all season.</p>
