      <h1>ESPN Analyst Thinks Tua Tagovailoa Should Return To Alabama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:20:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>After a hip injury ended Tua Tagovailoa’s season last week, just about everyone thinks it’s a no-brainer for him to forego his senior year and enter the NFL draft. But at least one ESPN analyst thinks that there’s some merit to returning to Alabama in 2020.</p>
      <p>On Thursday’s edition of <i>Get Up!</i>, ESPN analyst Emmanuel Acho asserted that from a monetary standpoint, it might make sense for him to go back. Acho explained that Tua has already potentially lost draft position – and money by extension – because of his injuries.</p>
      <p>Acho ultimately concluded that if Tua plays another year and doesn’t get injured in 2020, he could regain top prospect status the season after.</p>

      <blockquote>“It pains me to say this, I think Tua has to go back to school,” Emmanuel Acho said. “And it is monetarily speaking, what does Tua have to lose by going back to school? If he gets hurt again, he already has the injury notion that he is injury prone but if he goes back and he plays clean, you are talking about 15-plus million dollars guaranteed … I’m not for college athletes going back typically but in this case, Tua has more to gain by going back.”</blockquote>

      <h3>It’s a fair argument that Acho is making, but one that comes with a lot of risk to boot.</h3>
      <p>For starters, Tua would be leaving money on the table by going back to school, and would thus go another year without a paycheck for putting his body on the line.</p>
      <p>Another more obvious risk is that he might get injured again, and tank his draft stock even further.</p>
      <p>And of course there have also been plenty of prospects that returned to college to try and improve their stock. That hasn’t always gone as planned…</p>
      <p>We could argue for hours over whether Tua should return to Alabama or go pro in 2020. But it’s a decision that only he can make, and we should all ultimately respect whichever decision it is.</p>
