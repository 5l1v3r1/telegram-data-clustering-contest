      <h2>Mystery still surrounds the death of Minnie Lawson in the idyllic village of Ogle, Northumberland, more than 80 years later</h2>

      <p>It was a village cut off from the rest of the world, where strangers were rare and residents felt so secure they never locked their doors at night.</p>
      <p>But the grisly murder of one the community’s best known residents changed life in a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> hamlet for ever.</p>
      <p>And the mystery of who killed shopkeeper Minnie Lawson has hung over the village of Ogle, near Belsay, ever since.</p>
      <p>We're exploring some of the most shocking <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/crime">crimes</a> of years go by.</p>
      <p>Today we lift the lid on the horrific 1935 slaying of widow Minnie, which shook the community to its core, and to this day remains unsolved.</p>
      <p>Minnie’s murder hit our front page on Monday August 12 1935, after her body was found lying in a pool of blood by the bed in her picturesque cottage by 16-year-old neighbour Betty Graham.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old widow who ran a local shop from her home had been beaten to death with a hammer. Her bed was set alight, in an apparent effort to destroy evidence, and her home was in disarray as if an intruder had been searching for something.</p>
      <p>Betty, who lived at the local post office ran out into the street screaming and attracting the attention of neighbour Jacob Watson who extinguished the burning bed before calling the police.</p>
      <p>As a manhunt swung into action to find the killer Supt Wight of Northumberland Police was recalled from his holiday to take charge of the investigation.</p>
      <p>A description of the scene in the Chronicle read: ‘Mrs Lawson was found dead in her kitchen with severe head wounds, which had been inflicted during the night. A hammer-head and poker, blood-stained, have been found.</p>

      <p>“The bed was smouldering, but had not been slept in. A quantity of paper had been set on fire under the bed.</p>
      <p>“Missing from the house, a lady’s silver watch. No money appears to have been taken. The nature of the wounds suggests that the assailant may have spots of blood adhering to his clothing.’</p>
      <p>Minnie’s relatives were called to the cottage and could be seen speaking to Supt Wight.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/">Chronicle</a> reporter approached another officer at the scene, Insp Taylor, who very candidly told the journalist; “At present we are at a dead end.”</p>
      <p>Minnie had lived in her home, Ivy Cottage, for 28 years and her husband passed away five years before the murder.</p>
      <p>Our reporters also spoke to Mr Watson in the 24 hours after he walked into the scene of the murder.</p>
      <p>He said: “When Betty Graham ran through the house and shouted to us we though at first that Mrs Lawson might have fainted. My wife went in, and then my mother-in-law and myself followed. We found the room was full of smoke so I opened the windows and threw several pales of water over the bed.</p>
      <p>“We couldn’t see Mrs Lawson at first until the smoke cleared.</p>
      <p>“I touched her leg and I knew she had been dead several hours.”</p>
      <p>It emerged that Minnie had been a cautious woman, who would always lock her door, which was unusual a the time in such a quiet village, and rarely answered late night calls.</p>
      <p>On the Saturday before she August 11, Minnie opened her village shop. She stayed open until 9pm, when neighbours saw her shutting up. At around midnight, police believe she opened the door to her killer.</p>

      <p>Remote even today, life in Ogle in 1935 was even more so. The village was inhabited by a self-sufficient community made-up of just 80 residents, who all knew each other</p>
      <p>No-one in the village had seen a stranger in the two weeks before the murder. But the good weather that summer had made Ogle busier than usual with hikers and cyclists passing through.</p>
      <p>The long sunny days and increased custom prompted Minnie to keep her shop open later at night, it was reported.</p>
      <p>But unlike other Ogle residents Minnie would always lock her door at night.</p>
      <p>The shop-keeper was fond of young people, and she encouraged them to use her cottage-cum-shop as a meeting place, and the local farm hands that would congregate there called her ‘Aunt Minnie’.</p>
      <p>After questioning residents about strangers seen in the village, police were quick to reveal to the Chronicle that they were hunting three men over the killing. And officers mysteriously announced that one of the suspects they were looking for had ‘glaring eyes’. While another was described as being ‘a very fast walker’.</p>
      <p>The Chronicle printed detailed descriptions of all three men on its front page.</p>
      <p>But as the investigation wore on two suspects were ruled out, and detectives began to explore the theory that Minnie had been killed by a local, Neighbours said she would have been unlikely to open the door to someone she did not know.</p>
      <p>And after questioning everyone in the village detectives had learned that locals had found it odd that Minnie was so conscientious about locking her door at all times, leading to the rumour that she was keeping a stash of cash or something else of value in the cottage.</p>
      <p>A week after the tragedy Minnie was Buried next to husband in Walton, and police arrested a local farm labourer and charged him with murder.</p>
      <p>But with little evidence the case collapsed within days.</p>
      <p>The man’s life was said to have been ruined by the accusation.</p>
      <p>No-one else was ever charged with Minnie’s murder.</p>
      <p>And life in Ogle changed forever. The village’s tranquillity and innocence was broken, and residents began to lock their doors at night for the first time.</p>
