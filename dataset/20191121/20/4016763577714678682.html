      <h1>Grimes Believes Artificial Intelligence Will Make Live Music “Obsolete”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:24:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Fu</a></address>
      <p>Prior to becoming a full-time musician, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Grimes">Grimes</a> learned how to use the production software Logic for her neuroscience studies at Montreal’s McGill University. The Vancouver native brought her unique perspective to Sean Carroll’s <a href="https://art19.com/shows/sean-carrolls-mindscape/episodes/5f206f62-1d24-48a1-a466-47c6ff48e0a0"><i>Mindscape</i> podcast</a>, where she spoke about artificial intelligence’s growing capacity to create music.</p>
      <p>“I feel like we’re in the end of art, human art.” said Grimes, who is now going by the name c in reference to the speed of light. “Once there’s actual AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), it’s gonna be so much better at making art than us… Once AI can totally master science and art, which could happen in the next 10 years, probably more like 20 or 30 years.”</p>
      <p>She also predicted that AI will reach a point when it will be building and creating art for itself. “It’ll be able to see great art and it’ll be able to understand what true innovation is, probably even better than we can,” she explained. “I think this is both great and bad, but I think part of the reason it’s great is that I feel like that we’re kind of in this amazing time where we might be like the last artists ever, which feels fun.”</p>
      <p>From there, Grimes proceeded to speak about why she believes live performances are no longer valued as much. “I think live music is going to be obsolete soon,” she said before pointing out “DJs get paid more than real musicians.”</p>
      <p>To further illustrate her point, Grimes said people prefer the glossier version of reality presented by Instagram filters.</p>
      <p>“People are actually just gravitating towards the clean, finished, fake world,” she said. “Everyone wants to be in a simulation. They don’t actually want the real world. Even if they think they do and everyone’s like, ‘Yeah, cool, live music!’ if you actually look at actual numbers of things, everyone’s gravitating towards the shimmery perfected Photoshop world.”</p>
      <p>Following the podcast appearance, Grimes <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1197279332068020224">clarified her comments</a> about the end of human art on Twitter:</p>
      <blockquote>Recommend reading the forward [sic] of <i>Life 3.0</i> by Max Tegmark. he illustrates a cool example of what could happen when AGI gets to a point where it can be generating groundbreaking art very quickly. Not saying humans will stop making art – just saying it will be hard to compete w this and therefore art will be forever changed. So it’s a cool time to be creating now, as were [sic] presumably nearing the end of human-only art.</blockquote>
      <p>Fittingly, Grimes <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/grimes-announces-new-album-miss-anthropocene/">previously described</a> her next album, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Grimes/Miss-anthropocene"><i>MIss Anthropocene</i></a>, as “a concept album about the anthropomorphic goddess of climate Change” in which “each song will be a different embodiment of human extinction as depicted through a Pop star Demonology.” The project is slated to arrive on February 21, 2020.</p>
