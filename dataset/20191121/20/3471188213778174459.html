      <p>This Black Friday, you don’t need to shop online to grab a bargain on some fun new technology; ALDI is getting in on the action with specials on a range of TVs, a mini portable projector, a couple of wireless chargers and a power cube which – if you’re like me – you’ll love on your desk at work.</p>
      <p>These specials go on sale next Wednesday 27 November, so you’ve got plenty of time to work out which store you’ll get to before – as usual – these things all sell out.</p>

      <p>The headline special is a <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/special-buys/special-buys-wed-27-november/wednesday-detail-wk48/ps/p/58-ultra-hd-tv-with-hdr/">58-inch Ultra HD TV with HDR display for just $444</a>. Featuring all the normal features you’ve come to expect in a smart TV – including USB media playback, 4 HDMI ports, connections for soundbars and HiFi systems, the ability to record live TV and play back 4K Ultra HD content, this TV has you sorted for a rock bottom price.</p>

      <p>Fancy something smaller? This <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/special-buys/special-buys-wed-27-november/wednesday-detail-wk48/ps/p/32-hd-smart-tv/">32-inch Smart TV is just $222</a>, and features built-in Netflix, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, as well as 2 HDMI ports, digital tuner, and connections for your soundbar or HiFi needs. Like the larger TV, it can record live TV to watch later, and features an HDR display.</p>

      <p>Have you got a smartphone that charges wirelessly? There’s a couple of wireless chargers on sale for $24.99 too, including <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/special-buys/special-buys-wed-27-november/wednesday-detail-wk48/ps/p/alogic-qi-wireless-fast-charger/">a desktop/bedside table model</a> and <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/special-buys/special-buys-wed-27-november/wednesday-detail-wk48/ps/p/alogic-car-air-vent-wireless-fast-charger/">one that clips onto your car air vent</a> for wireless charging on the go. Featuring 10W fast charging on both, these are designed to charge your wireless-charging devices just a little bit quicker.</p>
      <p>For my money, though, I’d get the desk one and probably avoid the car mount one – in the car, I want my phone connected up for Android Auto, making wireless charging kind of pointless.</p>

      <p>My favourite pick of the Black Friday specials has to be this <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/special-buys/special-buys-wed-27-november/wednesday-detail-wk48/ps/p/power-cube-1/">Cocoon Power Cube for $19.99</a>. With just one wall socket, you get 4 power outlets and 2 10W USB outlets and you can use all of them easily without chargers blocking other ports as happens on power boards all the time.</p>
      <p>With a mounting accessory and adhesive strips in the box, this might be just what you need for your desk at work. I know I’ll be grabbing one for my desk, because I’m sick of a powerboard taking up room on top of the desk when I could stash one of these under the desk and get those unsightly cords out of the way.</p>
      <p>These and other <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/special-buys/special-buys-wed-27-november/">Black Friday specials go on sale at ALDI next Wednesday, 27 November 2019</a>. Be quick, they always disappear quick.</p>
