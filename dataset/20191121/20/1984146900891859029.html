      <h1>From swearing on air to goal drought and fan power: Full transcript of Allan Saint-Maximin on BBC Newcastle</h1>
      <h2>Here's everything Allan Saint-Maximin had to say in his interview on Total Sport on BBC Newcastle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:08:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Knight</a></address>
      <p>Allan Saint-Maximin has opened up on his life at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> in a revealing in-depth interview.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman spoke with Simon Pryde and John Anderson on BBC Newcastle's Total Sport show on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old faced a host of questions on a range of topics including adapting to life in England and the Premier League, and his goal drought on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>Saint-Maximin also discussed his sporting hero, who the fastest player at United is, and why he feels a special connection to the fans already</p>
      <p>Here's the full transcript on everything <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/allan-saint-maximin">Allan Saint-Maximin</a> had to say:</p>
      <h3>How's life been like in Newcastle so far?</h3>
      <p>"Good. It's not the same like Nice. I like the city. It's a small city but you have everything here.</p>
      <p>"I prefer to be in Newcastle with a lot of fans in the stadium because my job is to play football than live in Nice - good weather but not a lot of people in the stadium.</p>

      <h3>How have you been enjoying the Premier League?</h3>
      <p>"It's amazing. It's not the same - it's what I say always, in France it's really different.</p>
      <p>"If you lose one-zero, they don't go for two, three, four five. If they can lose one-zero, it's one-zero.</p>
      <p>"But here, it's really different because everyone runs everywhere and they want to score again, and again.</p>
      <p>"You see the game against West Ham, we win and have a lot of action but when you look at the game it's 3-2. It's good."</p>
      <h3>No matter what happens on the pitch, you seem to enjoy yourself with a smile on your face. You seem to be one of these players who loves playing football</h3>
      <p>"Of course, I love to play football. I started very young. It's not only my job, it's my passion.</p>
      <p>"When I do four against four in the street, it's a little bit the same for me.</p>
      <p>"I just want to enjoy and see what happens after."</p>
      <h3>The one thing you must be desperate to do - and you've come so close - is score a goal?</h3>
      <p>"I know. I have a lot of opportunities and I'm really happy.</p>
      <p>"When you're a striker like me and you finish a game and you have no opportunities to score, you can be really angry.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"But when you have opportunities and don't score, you just have to keep going. I can only do that, I can not say I lose this reaction and stop.</p>
      <p>"I know if I walk like this, a lot of things will come quick."</p>
      <h3>Do you get worried about not scoring goals, or do you just do what you do?</h3>
      <p>"I don't care. I care if I don't score and we lose. It's different.Â  If the team wins and I don't score, I'm happy because the most important thing is to win.</p>
      <p>"I don't give a f*** after the game if we win and I don't score. I don't play for myself, if I don't score and the team wins I'm happy."</p>
      <h3>Looking at the stats, of the nine games you've played there's only two defeats. The team have done pretty well since you've been playing</h3>
      <p>"I don't know if it's me but I'm happy because we win and I'm on the pitch."</p>
      <h3>How have you found the Premier League? Are you still adapting to the pace?</h3>
      <p>"It's different because in France you don't run like this. You don't run everywhere, when I start to come to the Premier League I get injured I think because of adaptation.</p>
      <p>"After that I keep going, I keep walking, I talk to the trainer and said it's really important for me and my body because I run a lot and it's a strong run.</p>

      <p>"I'm not a midfield player, I run like a striker. We take our time and now I'm really happy because I feel much better.</p>
      <p>"I play one game - better. I play a second game - better. And everything else feels better.</p>
      <h3>So what you're saying is there's still more to come?</h3>
      <p>"Yeah, of course."</p>
      <h3>Thierry Henry is someone you admired growing up, wasn't he?</h3>
      <p>"Yeah, he's an amazing striker. I have been lucky to talk one time with him when he came to Monaco.</p>
      <p>"I see him and he's a great guy. We can watch the game and the finish and you can learn, and this is really good for me."</p>
      <h3>You've never played for an English club before. Some people might be surprised your English is good. You obviously learnt so you could play in the Premier League?</h3>
      <p>"When I was young, I said to my mother I want to play in the Premier League. Thierry Henry, Arsenal, Robert Pires, every player, I enjoy a lot when I look at the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"My mother said if you want to play there, you have to speak English because if you don't speak English there, it will be more difficult for you.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes when you talk with a lot of players and you look in the papers, the adaptation is difficult.</p>
      <p>"If you can not speak with your partner or you can not speak with the trainer, it's really difficult for them to understand you and this is important to play better.</p>
      <p>"I said to my parent I need to play one against one, and if I cannot speak it's difficult to say. For this, I'm really happy because my mother said I have to learn English when I'm young and I listen because when I'm in school I listened - more than if my mother said to me nothing!"</p>
      <h3>Are there any of your team-mates you can't understand? Maybe because of their accents?</h3>
      <p>"Dwight - really difficult accent! I have a lot of players I understand good when they speak slow."</p>

      <h3>Do you not think when you try and get away from these defenders, rather than trying to blast the ball in, should you be trying to place it?</h3>
      <p>"If I score, nobody can say anything to me. I try to because normally I want to shoot like a little bit like Thierry Henry to the right of the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>"But I feel [against Bournemouth] I have to shoot strong in the middle and I have no luck because it's the crossbar and the ball goes away."</p>
      <h3>Would you prefer to play on the right-wing rather than the left-wing?</h3>
      <p>"I prefer to play on the left but my best position is number 10 because I'm more free, I can go everywhere.</p>
      <p>"But the left is better for me. I can play everywhere and just enjoy."</p>
      <p>"Sometimes when I play I have this problem a lot of times in France, it's difficult to move when the defender stays and the winger comes back and the midfielder comes.</p>
      <p>"But when you play number 10, you can go everywhere. If I want to go to the middle of the field, the defender can not come with me."</p>
      <h3>Are you still learning to play with Joelinton and Miguel Almiron?</h3>
      <p>"We're still learning because not too many times I play. I think it will be the same about Almiron, he runs a lot and works hard but hasn't scored many goals. I know it's really important to score but the job and what he does on the pitch is amazing, it's not just to score.</p>

      <p>"Against West Ham I was alone and want to score and I give him the ball and he loses it. After I want to kill him!"</p>
      <h3>Who would win a race between you, Almiron and DeAndre Yedlin?</h3>
      <p>"Really, I don't know. I don't feel like I'm too fast without the ball. I know with the ball I run quick, but without it I don't know.</p>
      <p>"It would be DeAndre, he's really fast."</p>
      <h3>The fans loved Hatem Ben Arfa and his skill and style of play. Did he inspire you at all, and do you hope to have the same type of connection with the fans?</h3>
      <p>"I love Hatem Ben Arfa. He's a really good player and we're born in the same country.</p>
      <p>"He's like me, we play four against four. I'm a little bit disappointed because he was injured in Newcastle and this would be more difficult for him, but he did great things in Newcastle and I think he loved a lot Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"If the fans love me, I can only be happy."</p>
      <h3>Did you speak to any players about Newcastle and what influenced your decision to join?</h3>
      <p>"I speak only a little bit with Hatem but not too much. I think for me it's the club and the trainer do a big difference because they talk to me about what they want to do.</p>

      <p>"They want Newcastle to be much better, buy some players, and make a good team. For me, this is important and I want to stay here and do everything here.</p>
      <h3>You had only been at the club a very short time but you went to the West End Foodbank. It's something you think is very important to do?</h3>
      <p>"For me, it's really important because I know where I'm from. I know before playing football, my mother worked a lot because my mother is a teacher and the father is the same.</p>
      <p>"They said the same thing to me always, you have to work and work hard and sometimes in life it's difficult.</p>
      <p>"I know I'm in a good position now but I know some people who cannot buy things. I like to go here because I feel good.</p>
      <p>"I remember about my life before and I enjoy a lot."</p>
      <h3>How have the fans responded to you?</h3>
      <p>"Yeah, I enjoy when I see the kids with the big smiles. I love it because I feel I do good things, I give a smile.</p>

      <p>"It's not only about playing and money, I give a smile and it's really important. I know sometimes I'm an example and it's really good."</p>
      <h3>Was football your first love, or did you have ideas about other sports and jobs you might do?</h3>
      <p>"No, not really. Always football."</p>
      <h3>When did someone first realise your talent and sign you up for a club?</h3>
      <p>"In Saint-Etienne. I have a lot of people see me play because before I play in a club not too good, and my mum was teaching somewhere a little bit bad.</p>
      <p>"I talked to my mother and sid I can do something in football. Before my mother said to me you're not too good, stop, it's better to go to school.</p>
      <p>"I said Mama believe me, I can do some things and she believed me. After we moved together to some better club and changed work, and after everything came quick.</p>
      <p>"I had a responsibility and she changed her work, I felt I can not go and play bad!</p>
      <p>"Because of this a lot of clubs came to me, I go to Clairefontaine and when you go there every club comes to see you.</p>
      <p>"After I go to Saint-Etienne and everything went up afterwards."</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Who is the best player you've played with?</h3>
      <p>"For this, I have a lot of good players. Kylian [Mbappe] for me is the best one.</p>
      <p>"Bernardo Silva, Fabinho, every player at Monaco was an amazing player."</p>
      <h3>Apart from the weather, how have you found settling in?</h3>
      <p>"It's a little bit difficult. It's Nice, the weather is really good and different.</p>
      <p>"Everything is different because in France I have everything, my friends and my family, I can see my parents and my sister.</p>
      <p>"Here, I'm good because I enjoy my work. If my job is good, I'm okay."</p>
      <h3>How have you interacted in training with Andy Carroll and Dwight Gayle, and do you think there's potential for you to score and provide on the pitch with those players?</h3>
      <p>"He's a good player Andy, he's a big man. Dwight, what he does is crazy, because I see a lot of things before when he plays in the second division and scored a lot of goals.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"I think he's a good striker. You have a good team with good strikers doing good things, and this is good because every players know we have to play good.</p>
      <p>"If Joe or some player plays bad, you have Andy and Dwight. You have a lot of good players."</p>
      <h3>Your family appears to be so important to you. Does this family strength stay with you always even when they're not with you?</h3>
      <p>"Yeah, always. My mother works a lot and my fathr is the same. When they can, I can talk a little bit.</p>
      <p>"I love my parents but I'm not always like Mama, Mama, Mama. I think it's normal because I want to work and do my job.</p>
      <p>"They like it and they are coming for Manchester City, I'm happy."</p>
      <h3>I guess St James' Park is the best stadium you've played in as a home stadium?</h3>
      <p>"Yeah, of course. Sometimes you can be to a big stadium with a lot of people but if they don't cheer you don't feel everything.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"Before I came, I talked with Patrick Vieira and he said to me the first or second game he played against Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"He said to me the fans were crazy, they cheer a lot. I feel okay, I want to see. I now know why they said that to me."</p>
      <h3>Who since you've come to the club has been your mentor?</h3>
      <p>"Steve Agnew helped me a lot. He showed me a lot of things so I can be the best player to help Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"When you have people believe in you, you think okay I can do that, I don't want to disappoint.</p>
      <p>"I want to do a great job so he can be happy."</p>
      <h3>Is it true you pick up the most fines?</h3>
      <p>"Ah, [Christian] Atsu said that! You know why, it's about my rings. In France we don't have this problem and here, the trainer doesn't like when you come in the club with the rings.</p>
      <p>"Before I don't know that, the players saw me with the rings and don't say nothing!"</p>
      <h3>What are your feelings on social media?</h3>
      <p>"I like Twitter because before a lot of people say to me what are you doing, don't speak with the fans. When you play good every fan is here, if you play bad they kill you.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"For me, it's like they give me a lot of things. They cry my name and give me power, and after they can give me a chance to play better.</p>
      <p>"If I play better, a lot of good things can come to me and I don't forget this. Sometimes I talk to a fan, and I feel like they can talk with me and I'm happy if they are happy."</p>
      <h3>What are your ambitions at Newcastle?</h3>
      <p>"If Newcastle can be a great club, I can stay - no problem. I want to do everything for Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"Steve said to me the club will do great things and the team will do much better and buy players every year.</p>
      <p>"I think this is good. If they stay like this I don't have to move because I feel good even if it is really cold!</p>
      <p>"It's really good in your head when you are somewhere and you know you can be bigger."</p>
      <h3>Is that a big ambition to represent your country?</h3>
      <p>"Yeah, it's normal. I can not say to you I don't want to play.</p>
      <p>"I want to play for my national team but I know it's difficult. They won the World Cup, they have a good team and they have great players.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes you have great players like Anthony Martial and Kingsley Coman who don't go. I know I have to work hard and after if I go, I'm happy, but if I don't go I'm happy in Newcastle."</p>
      <h3>You've been a team-mate of Mario Balotelli. What's he like in the dressing room?</h3>
      <p>"He's a good guy. It's different because he has a strong character, you have some players when you say some things they don't care, they don't listen.</p>
      <p>"But Mario, he don't like when you say s*** things about him."</p>
      <h3>You had a bit of a bad boy image but he can't understand where that's come from. Have you felt like you've had an image that isn't fair?</h3>
      <p>"I don't know where this comes from because I never do things like a bad boy.</p>
      <p>"But in France, the people judge you more than In England. When I walk in Newcastle or London, the people walk and smile and don't look at you like what's he doing, where's he from?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"In France it's like this. If you come in a good car or good clothes, [they think] he wants to be bigger than me and it's a different mentality. I don't know why."</p>
      <h3>Who is the most difficult player you've faced so far?</h3>
      <p>"I'm young when I played against him but [Jerome] Boateng. He's a really strong defender and is not slow, and I play against him when I was at Saint-Etienne and he's a really good player.</p>
      <p>"But I didn't have the same power like now!"</p>
      <h3>There's a big tradition of French players at Newcastle isn't there?</h3>
      <p>"Yeah, it's really good because I think a lot of French players come here it's because they feel good here and the club likes French players."</p>
      <h3>What is your celebration going to be?</h3>
      <p>"I have a plan - I wait a lot but I have a good celebration!"</p>
      <h3>Do you go out and socialise with the other players, and who is your best friend at the club?</h3>
      <p>"I like Willems but I like everybody, Jonjo and Andy too. I stay a lot with Willems because we came a little bit at the same time and we stay always together."</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>It seems like the spirit is very good with the players?</h3>
      <p>"Yeah. I play at some clubs and it's really not like this. I like what they do even with the young players.</p>
      <p>"I remember at Saint-Etienne and a lot of players tried to do some things not too good with me.</p>
      <p>"With Matty [Longstaff], everybody come to him because before he didn't play. When you have opportunity to score, everyone is happy for him.</p>
      <p>"I think this mentality is really good because if it's different in the dressing room it can be not too good, and I think this is really important.</p>
      <p>"Football is with eleven, it's not like tennis. You need to play with the team."</p>
      <h3>Who or what is your biggest inspiration?</h3>
      <p>"When I'm young, it's Robinho. I love this player. Now, I have not a player where it's like wow, amazing.</p>
      <p>"Before, you can look at Zidane, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo."</p>
      <h3>What about outside of football?</h3>
      <p>"I like boxing. I like Floyd Mayweather and Rafa Nadal in tennis. I like the mentality.</p>
      <p>"I like every sport, I don't just like football. I like to watch basketball, tennis, and everything.</p>
      <p>"I like Michael Jordan, he did great things."</p>
      <h3>If you had to pick between the top scorer, the most assists or the most nutmegs in the season, what would you pick?</h3>
      <p>"I want to score more goals and assists. If after I can do some nutmegs, it's good!</p>
      <p>"I like it because sometimes the player is tired and they don't think about nutmegs. But me, I always think this.</p>
      <p>"[In training] Not a lot because always when I come with the ball, they close everything! They prefer I run away."</p>
      <h3>How did that rapport with Willems come about?</h3>
      <p>"It's like you can remember the action against Man United. Everybody thinks I run and I don't see Jetro.</p>
      <p>"But I know where Jetro is because I don't know, I feel like when you play a lot and talk a lot you can understand more.</p>
      <p>"For this, I see a lot of good things coming. If I know Miggy and Joe like Jetro, I can give a better ball and play better and everything can be much better.</p>
      <p>"I think I'm good with Jetro because he does a lot of dribbling too and I like it."</p>
      <h3>What are your feelings ahead of the Aston Villa game?</h3>
      <p>"I feel good because we have confidence. You win two games and work hard to win and now you work hard, run a lot and I think everyone feels good.</p>

      <p>"Everyone wants to win this game before Manchester City."</p>
      <h3>Have you got a final message for the fans?</h3>
      <p>"I just want to say thank you. They let me feel good, if I came to Newcastle and everyone feels like who is this player, where's he from, you can't have the same good feeling.</p>
      <p>"They don't know me, but they watch a lot of games and videos and I can only say thank you.</p>
      <p>"I want to work hard, do everything to score and want to say thank you."</p>
