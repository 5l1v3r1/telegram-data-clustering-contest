      <h1>How to watch Tesla’s ‘cybertruck’ reveal tonight in Canada</h1>
      <h2>The event starts at 8pm PT/11pm ET</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:43:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>Tesla is set to reveal its first-generation electric truck tonight live from the west coast.</p>
      <p>If this event is anything like the Model Y event, Tesla will live stream it on its website and it might even run a little late. The Model Y stream was at this <a href="http://livestream.tesla.com/">URL</a> last time, so it’s likely at that URL again. If it changes, <i>MobileSyrup</i> will update the post.</p>
      <p>Tesla also has a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TeslaMotors/videos"> Youtube channel</a> that might broadcast the reveal as well.</p>
      <p>We don’t know very much about the truck so far, but Musk has revealed a few details. You can <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/06/tesla-reveal-cyber-truck-november-21/">read our previous post</a> to learn about the already announced features.</p>
      <p>As always, <i>MobileSyrup</i> will be watching the event as it unfolds, and we’ll have a post to detail all the new truck’s information shortly after it’s announced.</p>
