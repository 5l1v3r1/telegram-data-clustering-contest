      <h1>Latina women will finally earn the same as white men – in 2224</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:04:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/international" target="_blank">Poppy Noor</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, nearly 23 months after the start of 2018, the average Latina woman in the US finally earned what a white man earned in a year.</p>
      <p>That’s because Latina women were paid barely half of what a white man was in 2017 – earning <a href="https://iwpr.org/publications/gender-wage-gap-2017/">53 cents</a> to every white man’s dollar. That pay gap has also widened at an alarming rate: in 2016, Latina women were paid 67 cents to every white man’s dollar.</p>
      <p>When you lump all women from all demographics in together, they collectively have to <a href="https://www.pay-equity.org/day.html">work up until 2 April 2019 before they earn as much as white men</a> did in 2018 (the equivalent of four extra months).</p>
      <p>Native American women earn 58 cents to every dollar earned by a white man; black women earn <a href="http://www.equalpaytoday.org/equalpaydays">61 cents for every dollar</a>. White women and Asian women in the US are a little closer, earning 77 cents and 85 cents, respectively.</p>
      <p>Research suggests that this gap persists for Latina women <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/latina-workers-have-to-work-10-months-into-2017-to-be-paid-the-same-as-white-non-hispanic-men-in-2016/">regardless of their education, </a>experience or where they live.</p>
      <p>What’s more, research by the <a href="https://iwpr.org/issue/employment-education-economic-change/pay-equity-discrimination/">Institute for Women’s Policy</a> suggests that at the current rate of (non-)improvement, it will be 205 years before <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/11/178844/latinas-equal-pay-day-2017">Latinas get pay equity</a> in the US.</p>
      <p>Let me spell that out for you: this would mean Latina women can’t expect to earn as much as white men until 2224.</p>
