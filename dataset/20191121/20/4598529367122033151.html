      <p>Former National Security Council senior director Fiona Hill confirmed an anecdote that effectively proved her resolve on Thursday — and delivered a moment of comic relief at the same time.</p>
      <p>During Hill’s testimony, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) asked Hill about a story in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/who-is-fiona-hill.html">New York Times report</a> that claimed a boy in her class set one of her pigtails on fire while she was taking a test.</p>
      <p>“I understand when you were 11-years-old there was a school boy that set your big tails on fire. And you were taking a test. You turned around and with your hands snuffed out the fire and then proceeded to finish your test,” Speier said. “Is that a true story?”</p>
      <p>Hill responded that “it is a true story” and that she “was a bit surprised to see that pop up today.”</p>
      <p>“It’s one of the stories I occasionally tell,” Hill said. “Very unfortunate consequences afterwards. My mother gave me bowl hair cut.”</p>
      <p>After Hill’s remark drew laughter from the audience, she added that she “looked like Richard III.”</p>
      <p>Speier then told Hill that she thought “it underscores the fact that you speak truth” and that she is “steely.”</p>
