      <h1>Victoria’s Secret Officially Ditches 2019 Fashion Show After Lagging Sales</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:51:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author">By David Adams</a></address>
      <p>The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show has officially been axed for 2019, after the parent company of the world-famous lingerie brand found the catwalk extravaganza was no longer converting celebrity buzz into sales.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/21/victorias-secret-fashion-show-2019-cancelled/">Fortune</a> reports that in a Wednesday earnings call, L Brand’s CFO <b>Stuart Burgdoerfer</b> said VS “will be communicating to customers, but nothing similar in magnitude to the fashion show.”</p>
      <p>Burgdoerfer said there was no real “short-term sales response” in the aftermath of recent shows. It’s also been noted that bar a slight uptick in early 2018, Victoria’s Secret’s sales have fallen each quarter since late 2016.</p>
      <p>The decision to wind down the catwalk event, which last year included models <b>Adriana Lima</b> and<b> Candice Swanepoel</b>, plus appearances from musos like<b> Shawn Mendes</b> and <b>Halsey,</b> is not a massive surprise. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph earlier this year, Australian VS Angel <b>Shanina Shaik</b> <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/style/shanina-shaik-victorias-secret-show-2019/">said it won’t be happening in 2019,</a> presaging Burgdoerfer’s big announcement by months.</p>
      <p>All of this comes amid an interesting time in Victoria’s Secret history. Once the go-to brand for folks seeking celeb-endorsed lingerie, VS now finds itself combating upstarts like <b>Rihanna</b>‘s Savage x Fenty line.</p>

      <p>Then there’s the slight matter of L Brands’ CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/jeffrey-epstein-fallout-les-wexner-under-pressure-as-l-brands-reports-earnings.html"><b>Les Wexner</b> once being real tight with <b>Jeffrey Epstein</b></a>, and even gave the convicted sex offender power of attorney. Is that link directly correlated to the VS show falling through? Well, in all likelihood, no. But in an age where the <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/prince-andrew-steps-down-royal-duties/">Duke of York retires from royal duties for defending his ties to Epstein</a>, it’s worth mentioning nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Anyway! No VS show in 2019. That’s the story. Back to looking through catalogues and company Instagram pages, we guess.</p>
