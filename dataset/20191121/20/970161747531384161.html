        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a>’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-warren-plant/">Joe-Warren Plant</a>) behaviour has been getting out of hand in Emmerdale since he learned that sex abuser Maya Stepney (Louisa Clein) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-paedophile-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184198/">had been released from prison</a>, but he reached a new low last night when he slept with Leanna (Mimi Slinger) and then proceeded to walk out on her. Tonight, Dr Liam Cavanagh (Jonny McPherson) discovered the truth — and he was less than pleased.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leanna was devastated when Jacob <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-jacob-maya-pregnant-age-leanna-return-11187552/">walked out on her after they’d slept together</a>. Afterwards, the young man texted her asking if she was on the pill — and she was hurt once more by his blunt question.</p>
      <p>Feeling rejected, she opened up to Bernice (Samantha Giles) about what happened, confirming that she’d slept with Jacob. However, she asked Bernice to keep it a secret.</p>
      <p>Bernice was conflicted over what to do for the best, but when Leanna threw up in front of Liam after she took the morning after pill, she was left with no choice but to reveal everything.</p>

      <p>Liam was fuming, and — after berating Bernice for keeping this from him — he wasted little time in storming round to the shop to have it out with Jacob. He accused Jacob of forcing his daughter into sleeping with him, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/emmerdale-spoilers-dr-liam-cavanagh-attacks-jacob-gallagher-over-shocking-leanna-sex-allegation-10972112/">before punching him</a>.</p>

      <p>Upon learning of the reason why Liam attacked Jacob, David (Matthew Wolfenden) and Leyla (Roxy Shahidi) were disgusted with the young boy — and proceeded to tell him as much.</p>
      <p>However, it appeared as if Jacob was determined to get his own back, as Liam found himself being arrested on suspicion of assault as the episode came to a close.</p>
      <p>What does this mean for Liam?</p>
      <p>Will Jacob carry through with his accusation?</p>
