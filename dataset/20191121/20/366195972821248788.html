      <p>Rod Wave has been slowly buzzing throughout the year but 2020 is looking like a very promising year for him. The rapper's ability to blend in his experiences in the streets with vulnerability through his soulful music has made him a new voice for the streets. He is only a few weeks removed from the release of his latest project, <i>Ghetto Gospel</i> which was executive produced by <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/KevinGates/profile">Kevin Gates</a>. The project has undoubtedly built a base for him to continue to prosper in the future.</p>
      <p>Today, he came through with a brand new track titled, "Dark Clouds." The new single finds Rod Wave delivering his signature soulful delivery with a gospel touch as he details some of the darker times in his life. It's another promising song from him.</p>
      <p>Check it out below.</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>Hey mama, I've been feelin' homesick<br/>These demons inside my heart and I can feel 'em growin'<br/>I brought people around me without even knowing<br/>They all had secret agendas they wasn't showing</p>
