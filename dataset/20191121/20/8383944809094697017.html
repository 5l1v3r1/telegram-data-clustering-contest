      <h1>Measure recognizing 1915 events as 'genocide' blocked again in US Senate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:26:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author">DAILY SABAH WITH AFP</a></address>
      <p>A Republican lawmaker on Thursday blocked a US Senate resolution recognizing the 1915 events as "Armenian genocide," the second time in a week.</p>
      <p>Senator David Perdue prevented a bipartisan effort to pass the resolution by unanimous consent, arguing that its passage during a sensitive period "would undermine the administration's commitment to overcoming real challenges in our bilateral relationship with Turkey."</p>
      <p>The move angered Senate Democrat Robert Menendez, whose effort had been rebuffed the previous week after Republican lawmakers met with visiting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>
      <p>"It is amazing to me that the greatest superpower on the face of the earth just can't speak truth of history," Menendez fumed.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to relent," he said.</p>
      <p>Turkish officials have condemned the House resolution, while Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield to express Ankara's strong opposition to the bill.</p>
      <p>Turkey objects to the presentation of the 1915 incidents as a "genocide," rather calling them a tragedy in which both Turks and Armenians suffered casualties in the heat of World War I.</p>
      <p>Ankara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia under the supervision of international experts to examine the issue.</p>
