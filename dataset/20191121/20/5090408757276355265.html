      <p>After a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hunter-biden-father-of-luden-roberts-child-dna-test-2019-11">DNA test revealed Hunter Biden was the father of a baby in Arkansas</a>, the child’s mother has asked Biden to pay the $11,000 cost of her paternity case.</p>
      <p><a href="https://contexte.aoc.arkansas.gov/imaging/IMAGES/DMS/CK_Image.Present2?DMS_ID=E7EEA610F2D3292C8FDAF9278BD020619A9FB67EEA99B6D03A2552F5052D93E0951CAAD3DDB929EBA69385A1DA46501CC197D2D6B57980F5F7044AF05215453F&amp;amp;i_url=https://contexte.aoc.arkansas.gov/imaging/IMAGES/DMS">According to court documents filed on Wednesday</a> in Independence County, Arkansas, the baby’s mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts, spent $11,057.80 trying to prove Biden was the father of her child.</p>
      <p>Her lawyers said Roberts incurred the costs “as a direct result of [Biden]’s refusal to continue to support his child and the course of the litigation in this case.”</p>
      <p>She’s asking that the court award her $11,057.80 and “all other just and proper relief to which she might be entitled.”</p>
      <p>Roberts first filed a paternity case against Biden in May. She said she had been in a relationship with Biden, which resulted in a child that was born in August 2018.</p>
      <p>Her paternity petition asked that Biden pay <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hunter-biden-outed-dna-match-secret-child-failed-child-support-2019-11">child support and healthcare for the child</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time the child was born, Biden was dating his late brother Beau’s widow, Hallie Biden. <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/04/30/hunter-biden-splits-from-brother-beaus-widow-hallie/">Page Six reported in April</a> that Hunter and Hallie Biden had recently broken up. In May, he <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/06/12/hunter-biden-secretly-marries-south-african-beauty-melissa-cohen/">married Melissa Cohen</a>.</p>
      <p>Wednesday’s filing also mentioned Hunter’s father Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>The filing said Biden is “considered by some to be the person most likely to win his party’s nomination and challenge President Trump on the ballot in 2020.”</p>
      <p>It also noted that members of the Biden family are protected by the US Secret Service, suggesting that the child would also need protection.</p>
