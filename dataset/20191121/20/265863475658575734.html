      <h1>Fans Chooses Sides In Leanne Locken And Kary Brittangham Feud After Episode Airs Where Leanne Mocks Kary’s Ethnicity</h1>

      <p>The first of a string of <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/rhod-leanne-locken-calls-co-star-kary-brittingham-a-chirpy-mexican-fans-slam-her-for-being-racist-and-dandra-simmons-comments-337570/">problematic episodes of Real Housewives of Dallas</a> aired Wednesday night. Leanne Locken has come under fire for making racial comments about her co-star Kary Brittingham.</p>
      <p>During the latest installment of RHOD, the ladies travel to Thailand where Kary and Leanne bump heads.</p>
      <p>First, the group visits a few temples where Locken tells Kary to take off her hat multiple times. She then says to a co-star Kary should respond to her in ‘Mexican words’ after they get into a mini spat.</p>
      <p>Then, at a dinner where D’andra Simmons wore Leanne’s infinity dress as a joke, Locken was offended by Brittingham who took it as an opportunity to make fun of her creation.</p>

      <p>While telling Stephanie Hollman how upset she was about Kary’s actions, Leanne said: ‘You don’t have the balls to be courageous. C’mon Mexican, I thought you were all Mexican and strong. F*** that b**** you ain’t survive s*** and I’m tired of it. ‘</p>
      <p>Immediately, viewers took to social media to state their opinions.</p>
      <p>One person tweeted: ‘It seriously grosses me out very time LeeAnne impersonates and mocks @karybrittingham ’s accent and (sometimes)broken English. It’s disgusting and disrespectful to Spanish speaking cultures #RHOD.’</p>

      <p>‘As much charity work Leann claims she does it surprises me on how ignorant her comments toward kary were. You live in Texas wise up!!!’ added another.</p>
      <p>One viewer revealed: ‘So! Leanne blocked me because I stated that her statements tonight came off as racist and prejudice. They did! It was offensive to MANY. She always speaks about owning up to things I would’ve thought this would’ve been ignored or a simple discussion. #RHOD.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, others came to her defense due to Kary and D’andra’s actions.</p>
      <p>One viewer tweeted: ‘Omg what’s wrong with Kary &amp; D’Andra!!! On &amp; on &amp; on &amp; on!!!! Good on @BrandiRedmond loving her this season!!!! @LeeAnneLocken you handled that horrible situation so well!!’</p>

      <p>This person added: ‘D’Andra already starting the Thailand trip on some bullshit. And Kary of course co-signing. #RHOD,’</p>
      <p>Do you think that Leanne is racist?</p>
