      <p>Bolgatanga, Nov. 21, GNA - Civil Society Organizations (CSO) in the five regions of the North have held a consultative meeting to review the progress of the implementation of the Beijing global policy on achieving gender equality and women’s rights.</p>
      <p>The meeting held in Bolgatanga was aimed at identifying achievements made after the Beijing meeting in 1995 and participants discussed gaps in the implementation of the policy both by Government and CSOs, and the way-forward.</p>
      <p>The one day review meeting, which was organized by the Network for Women’s Rights (NETRIGHT) and the Widows and Orphans Movement (WOM) was funded by the African Women’s Development Fund (AWDF).</p>
      <p>Participants discussed a draft report on the critical areas worked on by thematic working groups from the CSOs and access interventions made by government and CSOs in the implementation of the identified critical areas in the advancement of women’s rights.</p>
      <p>Ms Abigail Fati Abdulai, the Executive Director of WOM, said the outcome of the meeting would also enable the CSOs to make a parallel report in March 2020 during a UN conference.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with the Ghana News Agency on the side lines of the meeting, Ms Abdulai said the representations at the meeting in Bolgatanga were a force to reckon with in the march towards global equality for women, “this meeting is also serving as a learning platform for some of the participants, and will create opportunities for other organization to understand the gaps in the policies”.</p>
      <p>The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BfPA) was adopted by 189 countries including Ghana in 1995, where 12 critical areas of concern with respect to women and the achievement of gender equality were identified.</p>
      <p>Some of the critical areas identified included, women and poverty, women and economy, Education and training of women and girls, violence against women, and women and armed conflict.</p>
      <p>The other areas were human rights of women, women in power and decision making, women and media, women and environment and institutional mechanism for the advancement of women.</p>
