      <p>It's common knowledge that the pay cheques for I'm A Celebrity differ vastly from star to star but there is one this year who is on significantly more than the rest.</p>
      <p>You might be surprised by just how little - or how much - some of the celebrities earn from their stint in the jungle.</p>
      <p>A TV insider confessed to The Sun that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> bosses have splurged over £1.4 million on the 2019 line-up and while Kate Garraway and Jacqueline Jossa have reportedly agreed on £75,000 for their fees.</p>
      <p>Rugby star James Haskell and DJ Adele Roberts fall slightly behind with their rumoured £50,000 cheques, there is one star who the channel is said to have broken the bank to get into the jungle.</p>
      <p>And it might not come as too much shock to learn that celeb is Caitlyn Jenner, who is thought to be taking home around £500,000 - which works out at around £25,000 a day.</p>
      <p>Nearest to Caitlyn on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> earnings table is said to be Ian Wright, who is getting £400,000, while Nadine Coyle isn't too far behind on £250,000.</p>
      <p>While he has just gone into the jungle as a new arrival, Andrew Whyment, better known to millions of viewers as Kirk Sutherland on Coronation Street, is said to be on £100,000.</p>
      <p>This year's lowest paid celeb is thought to be Myles Stephenson, a member of Rak-Su, who won The X Factor in 2017. His total cheque is said to be £25,000, what Caitlyn is earning per day!</p>
      <p>ITV have declined to comment on any of the pay cheque reports.</p>
