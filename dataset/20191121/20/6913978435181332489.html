      <p><b>BERLIN —</b> Germany on Thursday condemned Iranian security forces for using excessive force as they sought to quell protests sparked by a hike in petrol prices.<br/><br/>"We are shocked by reports of the deaths of more than 100 victims, and condemn the disproportionate action by Iranian security forces. The right to peaceful protest must be respected," a foreign ministry spokeswoman said in a statement.<br/><br/>"We call on the Iranian security forces to exercise the greatest possible restraint," she added.<br/><br/>Demonstrations erupted in sanctions-hit Iran on Friday, hours after the price of petrol was raised by as much as 200 percent, and unrest spread to scores of urban centers.<br/><br/>Officials have confirmed five deaths, but Amnesty International said on Tuesday that more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed and that the real toll could be as high as 200.<br/><br/>The full extent of the bloodshed is difficult to ascertain given a near-total internet blackout.<br/><br/>Berlin also urged Tehran to "completely lift" the blockade on the Internet, said the foreign ministry spokeswoman. — AF{PFP</p>
