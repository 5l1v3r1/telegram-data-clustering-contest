      <p>There were 2,290 cases of lung injury linked to vaping as of November 20, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>That's an increase of 118 cases from last week, when there were 2,172 cases of vaping-related lung injuries.</p>
      <p>The vaping injuries have been reported in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Alaska remains the one state without any vaping-related injuries reported to the CDC.</p>
      <p>The CDC also reports 47 confirmed deaths in 25 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
      <p>CDC recommends that people not use e-cigarette products that contain THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. While it appears that vitamin E acetate, a thickener used in some vaping products, is linked to the lung injury cases, the agency can't rule out other chemicals, it said.</p>

        <b>Trump to hold e-cigarette meeting on Friday</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, according to the White House, President Donald Trump has scheduled a meeting for Friday related to a separate issue around e-cigarettes: the rise in youth use and how e-cigarettes should be regulated.</p>
      <p>"President Trump will hear from outside stake holders on the issue of youth usage of e-cigarettes and the government's role in regulation," White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere told CNN in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Participants will include a diverse group of advocacy, industry, non-profits, medical associations, and State officials," Deere said.</p>
      <p>"As the President has said, there is a serious problem among our youth and their growing addiction to e-cigarettes. The policy making process is not stalled -- it continues to move forward. This meeting will allow the President and other Administration officials an opportunity to hear from a large group, representing all sides as we continue to develop responsible guidelines that protect the public health and the American people."</p>
      <p>On September 11, Trump announced the US Food and Drug Administration would be putting out "some very strong recommendations" regarding the use of flavored e-cigarettes in "a couple of weeks." At the time, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the policy would see "all flavored e-cigarettes other than tobacco flavor" removed from the market.</p>
      <p>No policy has been announced yet.</p>
      <p>Trump tweeted earlier this month about the vaping meeting, saying it would be "to come up with an acceptable solution to the Vaping and E-cigarette dilemma."</p>
      <p>"Children's health &amp; safety. Together with jobs, will be a focus!" he said.</p>
      <p>Trump also recently told reporters outside the White House that raising the age to buy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/health/trump-vaping-age-21-bn/index.html">vaping products to 21</a> is also a possibility.</p>
