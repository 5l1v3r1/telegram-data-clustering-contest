      <p>PORTUGUESE DUO JOAO Sacramento and Nuno Santos are to leave their jobs as coaches at Lille in order to become part of compatriot Jose Mourinhoâ€™s staff at Tottenham Hotspur, the French club said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Sacramento, 30, was the assistant coach to Christophe Galtier in northern France. He initially joined Lille in January 2017 and worked under former coach Marcelo Bielsa, who was sacked later that year.</p>
      <p>Santos has worked as goalkeeping coach at Lille since the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>Now 46, he was a goalkeeper on the books at Benfica in 2000 when Mourinho began his coaching career with the Lisbon giants.</p>
      <p>Both men were close to Luis Campos, the Portuguese transfer guru who works as an advisor for Lille and is also close to Mourinho.</p>
