      <h1>Tarkwa LMC receives One million cedis to commerce work</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:24:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author">Erica Apeatua Addo, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tarkwa (W/R), Nov 21, GNA - The Deputy Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Mr Benito Owusu-Bio, has presented a seed capital of One million Ghana cedis to the Tarkwa Local Management Committee (LMC) to facilitate the development of Tarkwa and its environs.</p>
      <p>Mr Owusu-Bio, who was assisted by the Chairperson of the Minerals Development Fund (MDF), Madam Esther Happy Edjeani, said the donation was to fulfil President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo's promise to improve upon the state of mining communities in the country.</p>
      <p>Inaugurating and swearing- in members of the Tarkwa LMC under the Mining Community Development Scheme of the MDF at the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Mr Owusu-Bio said it was time for mining communities to see the worth of the minerals exploited from their soil.</p>
      <p>"Government after government have made strides to establish laws and policies to govern the use of mineral royalties in the country. Previously, all royalties were lodged and managed through the Consolidated Fund," he said.</p>
      <p>According to him, in order to promote direct development in the mining communities in the country, the government in 2016 passed the Minerals Development Fund Act, (Act 912).</p>
      <p>"The main objective of the Act is to provide financial resources for the direct benefit of mining communities, holders of interested land within mining communities, traditional and local government authorities within mining communities, and institutions responsible for the development of mining in Ghana," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Owusu-Bio stressed that though there were several socio-political, environmental and economic issues bedevilling the mining sector, the current government would eradicate the challenges.</p>
      <p>He said the government would continue to introduce sustainable measures to counteract mining bottlenecks.</p>
      <p>"We are also aware of the 12 per cent capping affecting the mineral royalties and we are in talks with the Finance Ministry to stop the capping on the MDF," Deputy Minister said.</p>
      <p>He used the opportunity to express his appreciation to the various mining companies who have contributed significantly to the Fund in the form of royalties, adding that, they would be coming to them for more donations as prescribed by the MDF Act section (18).</p>
      <p>Mr Owusu-Bio entreated stakeholders in the Municipality to support the committee with developmental ideas, and through other viable means possible, since they would account for every pesewa released into the coffers.</p>
      <p>He was hopeful that under the new strategic Scheme the development of Tarkwa would reflect the wealth its soil produces, to eliminate agitations by the youth and also uplift the face of the Municipality into the long-desired “Gold City”.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources in collaboration with the MDF would organize annual Minerals Development Achievements Award (MDAA), he announced.</p>
      <p>The MDAA Awards, he said, would be used to reward mining companies that have contributed immensely to the Fund, the best LMC, the most complied beneficiary institutions and individual, and those who have also made significant charities to the Fund.</p>
      <p>The seven-member committee, chaired by Mr Benjamin Kwaku Asabil, a businessman and the New Patriotic Party (NPP) Constituency Chairman of Tarkwa-Nsuaem is to oversee the direct development of the mining communities as well as initiate developmental plans in consonant with the National Medium Development Plans for implementations.</p>
      <p>Other members of the committee are ; Mr Glibert Kenndy Asmah, Municipal Chief Executive of Tarkwa-Nsuaem, Mr Desmond Boahene, Inspector of Mines from Minerals Commission, Mr Stephen Adjei representative from AngloGold Ashanti (Iduapriem) Limited, Nana Kwesi Atobra II, Divisional Chief of Essuoso Traditional Area, Miss Eunice Addo, and Mr Collins Ntim representatives of women and youth groups respectively.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the committee, Mr Asabil pledged to let transparency and accountability prevail as they begin their term in office.</p>
