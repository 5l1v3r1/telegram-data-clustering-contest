      <p>उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् ॥</p>
      <p>
        <i>Udaara charitaanaam tu vasudhaiva kutumbakam</i>
      </p>
      <p>This mantra defined ‘Glocal’ millenia before the term could be coined. And for a town like Mangaluru which being on the coast has always been a mini cosmopolitan melting pot of culture, hosting, boosting and accomodating a myriad of cultures, this mantra defines its very fabric.</p>
      <p>And it is with this thought that the <a href="http://mlrlitfest.org/">Mangaluru Lit Fest</a> came to be - a celebration of and a deliberation on ‘The Idea of Bharat’.</p>
      <p>And in ten days from now, the city will host the second edition of the festival, titled ‘The Idea of Bharat - Today and Tomorrow’. And the weekend affair has been curated to host the best of minds from across the globe as well as natives whose work and vision has redefined the ‘Idea of Bharat’.</p>
      <p>Inaugurated by Jnanapeeta awardee, poet and folklorist Dr Chandrashekara Kambara, the festival will also celebrate local art, culture, folk music and regional language literature.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the venue decor has been designed by local artists showcasing local kavi art on ecofriendly medium like paper and fabric in a bid to say not to plastic banners and flexes in the venue.</p>
      <p>Organised by Mangaluru Literary Foundation, in association with Kannada and Culture Department, the<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MlrLitFest/"> Lit Fest</a> this year will present the Lifetime Achievement Award to renowned researcher, author and historian Dr M Chidananda Murthy. The maiden edition <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/culture/mangaluru-lit-fest-honouring-six-decades-of-the-man-who-reinvented-the-idea-of-bharat">presented this award</a> to novelist S L Bhyrappa, who right then handed over the award cheque to Shri Rama School of Kalladka, which had made news after being denied funds from Kollur temple by the previous government.</p>

      <p>When: November 29 and 30</p>
