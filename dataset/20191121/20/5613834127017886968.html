      <h1>Gary Dauberman Says Second Season of “Swamp Thing” Was Set to Explore “More Twisted Horror Tales”</h1>

      <p>DC Universe’s short-lived <b>“Swamp Thing”</b> managed to work in some fun “monster of the week” type craziness, but the ten episodes we got were primarily centered on the origin storyline of Alec Holland/Swamp Thing and his relationship with Abby Arcane, along with a heavy focus on Avery Sunderland and his dirty deeds. But if a second season had been ordered up by DC, co-creator/writer/executive producer <b>Gary Dauberman</b> explained in a chat with <a href="https://www.comicbookmovie.com/tv/dc/swamp_thing/swamp-thing-executive-producer-and-writer-gary-dauberman-reveals-scrapped-season-2-plans-exclusive-a171702">Comic Book Movie</a> this week, the series would’ve been free to cut loose a whole lot more.</p>
      <p>“<i>I think if you’re interested in what the other seasons were going to be like, you can go back to the source material</i>,” Dauberman told the site, specifically referring to Alan Moore’s run.</p>
      <p>“<i>Season one is very much like a movie in that it has a beginning, middle, and end, and is one story told over the course of ten episodes and what I liked a lot about the comics is that there’s like werewolf in a hospital and things like that, <b>so we would have had episodes like an anthology with standalone stories</b></i>,” Dauberman continued. “<i>The swamp is very much the kitchen sink of supernatural terror and, as you know, you can go into different subgenres of horror with that and <b>I was really looking forward to exploring that in season two and getting into some of the more twisted horror tales from the later comics</b></i><b>.</b>”</p>
      <p>He added, “<i>It just would have got weirder. For people who don’t know the character, season one was telling people what Swamp-Thing was all about but<b> season two was going to be more about getting into the deeper, twisted, weirder, and gross ideas</b>.</i>”</p>
      <p>The first season of “Swamp Thing” didn’t quite end up living up to its potential, but the creative team’s season two approach sounds WAY more in line with what I was hoping to see more of from the series overall. Needless to say, it’s a huge bummer that DC Universe pulled the plug as quickly as they did, as the show could’ve gone on to become something pretty special.</p>
      <p>Alas, we’ll never know what could have been…</p>
