      <h1>REPORT: Nike’s Value Up $26.2 Billion Since Colin Kaepernick Endorsement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:55:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:55</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Remember the outrage that came 14 months ago when Nike signed Colin Kaepernick to an endorsement deal and making him one of the faces of the company’s infamous “Just Do It” ad campaign?</p>
      <p>His face appeared on billboards, television commercials and online ads and people swore that Nike would fall because of it.</p>

      <p>Those people were so wrong. Nike’s sales figured reportedly boomed in the ensuing months after the deal and it’s only gotten bigger since then, according to<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nikes-value-is-up-262-b-since-colin-kaepernick-endorsement-now-its-close-to-unveiling-his-shoe-150012824.html"> Yahoo</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“As of Wednesday, Nike’s stock rose over 18 percent since the announcement of the Kaepernick deal, adding a whopping $26.2 billion to the company’s bottom line and valuing it at nearly $146 billion. While that bump is associated with a wide range of factors across the corporation, the notion of a Kaepernick-centered campaign being an albatross for sales and popularity has never come close to materializing.”</blockquote>
      <p>Kaepernick has also had quite the influence on the footwear and apparel company when he complained about a Betsy Ross-themed shoe before it hit circulation, which in turn had Nike recalling nationwide shipments just days before its release.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick has been out of the league since the end of the 2016 season. No team has signed the free agent quarterback, in large because of the controversy surrounding his decision to kneel during the playing of the national anthem.</p>
      <p>Since then, Kaepernick has filed a legal grievance against the league and settled in earlier in 2019 and recently held a workout at a local Atlanta area high school for several NFL teams to check out his talent.</p>
