      <p>As the ill-fated <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/uncharted_4_a_thiefs_end">Uncharted</a> movie and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/05/sony_establishes_new_unit_to_adapt_games_for_film_and_tv">recently established PlayStation Productions can attest</a>, Sony’s a fan of video game adaptations. The problem it has is getting its ideas off the whiteboard and into actual cinemas. The two (!) <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/psminis/angry_birds">Angry Birds</a> films prove that it’s capable, though, and there are all sorts of rumours swirling around a <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/psone/crash_bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> conversion right now.</p>
      <p>According to website <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/wegotthiscovered.com/movies/animated-crash-bandicoot-movie-development-sony-pictures/">We Got This Covered</a> – citing unnamed sources it claims have shared accurate information with it in the past – the manufacturer has a new flick featuring its former mascot in the works. Given that Activision retains rights to the manic marsupial, this is more likely to be a Sony Pictures joint than a PlayStation project.</p>
      <p>Of course, it does make sense: <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a> and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/crash_team_racing_nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> have reignited interest in the character, and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/crash_bandicoot_buses_invade_britain">he’s currently plastered all over PlayStation 4 bus banners in the UK</a>. The hero also seems like a solid fit for some kind of animated movie, perhaps similar to the recent <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/ratchet_and_clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> adaptation. (Although hopefully better than that!)</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/is_sony_teasing_a_new_crash_bandicoot_game_in_latest_tv_ad">With talk of a new game also in the pipeline</a>, it seems like the future is bright for the popular PSone protagonist. And that’ll come as good news for fans of the franchise, after he spent almost a decade dormant. Indeed, whether this rumour turns out to be true or not, it’s clear that the outspoken ‘coot’s got a lot of life left under all of that orange fuzz.</p>
