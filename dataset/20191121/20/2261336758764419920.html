      <p>It finally happened, after several years it looks like the UFC is trying to muscle us out of the bad fight watching business... At least, that’s what I have to assume after last week’s UFC Sao Paulo: Blachowicz vs. Jacare fight card. Any more, the UFC schedule is so packed that it seems a chance to watch bad fights on our own time rarely comes around anymore. So, enjoy it while it lasts, since who knows when we’ll get another chance!</p>
      <p>Oh... wait, next week?... Okay, we’ll actually just be back next week.</p>

      <p>This week’s show focuses on the careers of former great champions, and some of their most listless, un-fun late career losses. Notably Chuck Liddell, Renan Barao, and Tito Ortiz (we’ve already done a full BJ Penn epsiode). We’re starting out the show with Chuck Liddell vs. Keith Jardine from UFC 76, and following that up with Renan Barao vs. Andre Ewell from last year’s UFC Fight Night Sao Paulo, and wrapping it all up with Tito Ortiz vs. Matt Hamill from UFC 121. We thought about just doing Renan Barao’s last five bouts, but that seemed too grim, even for us.</p>
      <p>As always, we’re watching each of these videos over on Fight Pass. If you’d like to follow along with us, just start the video at the beginning, along with Zane’s countdown. Or, if you’re watching them through some other means, Connor will do his best to tell you when round 1 starts, so you can sync up that way.</p>
