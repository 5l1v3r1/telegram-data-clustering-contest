      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite passes through the FCC sporting 6.7 inch display</h1>

      <p>If it seems like a long time since Samsung released their Galaxy S10 series it’s because it is. That hasn’t stopped them from cashing on the Galaxy S10 success with the development of a mid-range Galaxy S10, the S10 Lite.</p>
      <p>Although we already have a lower specced Galaxy S10e, Samsung have decided to attempt to bring the S10 series to more people with a more affordable S10 Lite. Slashleaks has uncovered some FCC documents on a Samsung model number SM-G770F, the S10 Lite.</p>

      <p>The size of the phone is far from small with it being 160mm tall and 75mm wide resulting in a diagonal display measurement of 170mm. The 170mm display size is 6.7 inches — making it bigger than the S10+ but the same size display as the Galaxy S10 5G.</p>

      <p>There is very little revealed about the device other than that but previous leaks place a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and 8GB of RAM onboard it — hardly the specs you would expect from a “Lite” phone. The rear camera is expected to be a triple camera setup and a single front-facing camera.</p>
      <p>Samsung mid range phones sell really well here in Australia so when it is released we may well see it here but that depends on their plans for the A series in Australia. If this is a “Lite” phone then I can’t wait to see what’s next in store for a premium smartphone.</p>
