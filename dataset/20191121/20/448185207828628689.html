      <p><b>London</b><b>: </b>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn locked horns over several issues including Brexit in their first TV election debate. Johnson on Tuesday promised to “end this national misery” and slammed Labour for offering “only division and deadlock”, BBC reported. Whereas, Corbyn said Labour would “get Brexit sorted by giving you, the people, the final say”. The first half of the debate was dominated by questions on Brexit. Johnson wants to win a majority in December 12 general election so that he can get the Brexit deal, agreed with the EU, into law and take the UK out of the bloc on January 31 and begin talks with Brussels on a permanent trading relationship. Corbyn says he would tear up Johnson’s agreement and negotiate a new deal with the EU. (IANS)</p>
