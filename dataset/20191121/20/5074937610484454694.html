      <p>Accra, Nov. 21, GNA - The Electoral Commission (EC) today handed the final Certificates of Registration to two newly formed political parties; Ghana Union Movement (GUM), and Power Unity Party (PUP).</p>
      <p>This brings to 27 the number of registered political parties in the country, which would be seeking to contest the 2020 Presidential and Parliamentary elections.</p>
      <p>Mrs Jean Mensa, the Chairperson of the EC, who presented the certificates to them on Thursday, said it was in partial fulfillment of Section (8) sub-section (2) of the Political Parties Act 574.</p>
      <p>She explained that the presentation signified the two had satisfied the requirements of the Political Parties Act that includes national, regional and district representation and the consistency of the parties’ internal organisation with the 1992 Constitution. </p>
      <p>Mrs Mensa said they were mandated to, within 90 days after the issuance of the certificate, to submit to the EC a written declaration giving details of all their assets and expenditure, including contributions and donation in cash or in kind.</p>
      <p>“Should your party refuse or neglect to comply with this provision your certificate will be cancelled,” she noted.</p>
      <p>“You will be required to submit to the Commission, the names, titles and address of your offices at the national, regional, district and constituency levels and at such other organisations as the Commission may direct.”</p>
      <p>Mr Samuel Tettey, the Deputy Chairman in-Charge of Operations, EC, said the Commission was running an open-door policy and welcomed constructive criticism to enhance its work. </p>
      <p>“Do not go and sleep until elections. Work hard and let your presence be felt,” he said. </p>
      <p>Rev Christian Kwabena Andrew, the Founder of the GUM, in a brief remark, said his Party sought to improve the livelihoods of the people by adding value to agriculture produce.</p>
      <p>As part of the Party’s Manifesto, he said, it would improve the current Free Senior High School programme by providing free “provisions’’ to students when elected into power.</p>
      <p>Mr Eliyahu Boateng, the Founder of PUP, stated that the Party would also prioritise agriculture to employ more youth.</p>
