      <p>Award-winning singer Cher has raised doubt about Jeffrey Epstein’s death as she took to Twitter to share her opinion about the scandal involving his high-profile acquaintances. In her post, the star sounded suspicious about whether the once powerful financier and convicted paedophile had actually killed himself.</p>
      <blockquote>“Nite [sic] Jeffery Epstein died…or… whatever. What really happened?! Don’t know ‘all’ the info, but its [sic] always those with ‘no power’ who see the wheels and smell the gasoline first”, she posted, adding that “rich&amp;powerful men’s lives are over if they are found to be pedophiles” and that they are holding on to power.</blockquote>

      <p>​Although the response to her tweet was far from sweeping, as less than 1,000 people commented on it, many appreciated her speaking up.</p>

      <p>​Although the disgraced financier died under suspicious circumstances in August, the official verdict that it was a suicide is <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911061077234421-pewdiepie-weighs-in-on-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-controversy/">debated</a> by many commenters. Over the past several weeks, thousands of netizens have joined the meme craze “Epstein didn't kill himself” on social media.</p>

      <p>​US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who rubbed shoulders with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and was Prince Andrew’s friend, was arrested in July for allegedly trafficking underage girls at his mansion for sex. He pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. If convicted, he could have faced up to 45 years in jail. However, he died on 10 August at the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in New York. The official cause of his death was suicide, but this has been widely disputed by forensic experts and others.</p>
      <p>Recently, two prison guards <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911191077352172-two-prison-guards-charged-with-conspiracy-falsifying-records-in-connection-with-epstein-suicide/">were charged</a> with conspiracy and falsifying records in connection with Epstein's suicide. The jail workers, who were tasked with monitoring the unit of convicted sex offender Epstein at the time of his death, were taken into custody, as earlier reports suggested. The guards had to check on Epstein every 30 minutes, but instead slept for hours and falsified records, a report by The New York Times said, quoting officials familiar with the matter.</p>
