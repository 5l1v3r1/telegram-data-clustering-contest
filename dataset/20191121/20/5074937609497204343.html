      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:00:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dennis Peprah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sunyani, Nov 21, GNA - The New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) are already deeply involved in the District Assembly Elections (DLEs), Mr. Kwasi Ameyaw-Cheremeh, the Majority Chief Whip in Parliament has said.</p>
      <p>He observed the situation had worsened to the extent that the two major political parties organised primaries, clandestinely to elect candidates to contest the local elections which breached the Constitution.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission EC) will be organising DLEs and Referendum to amend article 55(3) of the 1992 Constitution, which prohibits political parties from sponsoring a candidate, the use of existing political party symbols and canvassing for votes on the platform of a political party in DLEs.</p>
      <p>It shall start at 0700 hours and close at 1700 hours on Tuesday, December 17 this year.</p>
      <p>The Referendum is in fulfillment of the 1992 Constitutional requirement for the electorate to approve or reject the amendment of Article 55(3) for the introduction of multi-partisan system into local level elections.</p>
      <p>According to the EC, neither the Referendum nor the DLEs was an election of MMDCEs.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a public forum on the Referendum,in Sunyani, Mr. Ameyaw-Cheremeh, the Member of Parliament; for Sunyani East said the electorate would do a great disservice to the nation if they rejected the need to amend the Article 55 (3), which was an entrenched provision in the constitution.</p>
      <p>The Parliamentary Select Committee on Local Government and Rural Development is organising the nationwide forum to explain and sensitise the electorate on the Referendum for them to make informed decision by voting "Yes" on the polls day.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ameyaw-Cheremeh explained that framers of the District Assembly Concept did not consider and include partisanship in it because around 1988 and 1989 there was no existence of political parties.</p>
      <p>He said considering the level and strength of Ghana's internal democracy, the amendment of Article 55(3) was necessary to consolidate the gains of our democracy.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ameyaw-Cheremeh advised the electorate to shun nation-wreckers and vote "yes" during the referendum so as to obtain the required 40 per cent voter turnout and 75 per cent or more ‘Yes’ votes required for the amendment of the entrenched clause in the Constitution.</p>
