      <h1>Environmental group’s lawsuit seeks to quash ‘anti-Alberta’ inquiry</h1>
      <h2>UCP launched inquiry into where Canadian environmental charities get their funding</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:28:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:28</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>An environmental law firm is asking a court to strike down Alberta’s inquiry into the role that foreign money has in financing the activities of charities that oppose the oilsands.</p>
      <p>Ecojustice claims the province’s inquiry into what it calls anti-Alberta activities is politically motivated, prejudges conclusions and is outside provincial jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>“It really means something when a government decides to use the judicial process to silence people,” said Devon Page, the lawyer who filed the lawsuit in Calgary Court of Queen’s Bench on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Soon after the election last spring, the United Conservative government <a href="https://www.ponokanews.com/news/alberta-to-hold-2-5m-inquiry-into-how-oil-and-gas-opponents-are-funded/">created a $2.5-million inquiry</a> to examine concerns that U.S. environmental charities are funnelling money to their Canadian counterparts in an effort to landlock Alberta oil to benefit U.S. energy companies.</p>
      <p>Inquiry commissioner Steve Allan has already been conducting interviews.</p>
      <p>The inquiry’s factual premise has been seriously challenged several times, but this is the first challenge to its legality.</p>
      <p>“The inquiry has been called not to address a matter of pressing public interest, but to justify a predetermined intent to harm the reputations, economic viability and freedom of expression of certain organizations,” says the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The inquiry’s terms prejudge its findings, alleges the lawsuit, because they assume that such campaigns exist, that they spread lies and that there is a plot to frustrate an industry assumed to have been doing a good environmental job.</p>
      <p>The document notes that the government’s order in council applies perjorative terms such as “anti-Alberta” to those who may be subject to the inquiry.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit also alleges that inquiry commissioner Steve Allan was a donor to the UCP leadership campaign of Doug Schweitzer, now Alberta’s justice minister, who appointed him to the job.</p>
      <p>Those concerns, it claims, “(transform) the inquiry from an independent fact-finding mission into a predetermined demonstration of misconduct, resulting in a reasonable apprehension of bias.”</p>
      <p>Two government spokespeople emailed identical responses to the lawsuit: “A foreign-funded activist group opposing the inquiry on foreign-funded attacks on Alberta’s oil and gas workers is not surprising and speaks for itself.”</p>
      <p>Ecojustice says about 14 per cent of its funding comes from outside Canada.</p>
      <p>Jonah Mozeson of Alberta Energy forwarded an article to The Canadian Press from the Daily Telegraph newspaper in London that suggests Russian money has also fuelled energy disinformation campaigns.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time concerns have been raised about the inquiry.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International has said it threatens freedom of expression and freedom of association.</p>
      <p>Last week, a longtime Edmonton charitable foundation that doesn’t fund environmental groups or receive U.S. money <a href="https://www.ponokanews.com/news/hyperbolic-longtime-edmonton-charity-questions-anti-albertan-inquiry/">released an open letter</a> that said the inquiry’s assumptions come “dangerously close to government direction of speech and thought.”</p>
