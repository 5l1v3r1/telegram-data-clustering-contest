      <h1>Salim Mechant on not being paid royalties by Yash Raj Films</h1>

      <p>Popular music composer, Salim Merchant, one half of the Salim Sulaiman duo, has alleged that they have not received royalty payments for their songs by Yash Raj Films.</p>
      <p>In a revealing interview with <i>The Quint</i>, Merchant said, “Yash Raj has been collecting money on behalf of the composer and lyricist — that much I know — but I don’t know whether they have paid anyone. They have certainly not paid me and Sulaiman.”</p>
      <p>The claim was made after the Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS) filed an FIR against Yash Raj Films on 20th November. This was down to Rs. 100 crore collected by the production giant, which is said belongs to IPRS members.</p>
      <p>Merchant added, “I know Javed Akhtar sahab has not been paid, for sure… you know he’s not been paid. Sulaiman and I have not been paid – any royalties that have come from Yash Raj, we have not been paid.”</p>
      <p>Adding further spice to the story, Merchant claimed that T-Series had also not cleared all of his royalty payments.</p>
