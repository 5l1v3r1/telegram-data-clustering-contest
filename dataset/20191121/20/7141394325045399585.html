      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:18:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Rainn Wilson, widely known as Dwight from The Office, is asking crypto fanatics to turn over their ‘bananas’. Quoting billionaire venture capitalist Mark Cuban, who said he’d rather have bananas than Bitcoin, Wilson is asking for charitable donations in cryptocurrency on behalf of the <a href="https://www.monafoundation.org/">Mona Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization that supports grassroots initiatives dedicated to delivering education and gender equality.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the foundation supported education initiatives for more than 411,000 students in 16 projects in 10 countries to help the poor to excel with a focus on women and girls.</p>
      <p>The organization’s <a href="https://www.monafoundation.org/give-bitcoin/">new portal</a> is now accepting several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). Donations are processed through Coinbase with 100% of every gift going directly toward education, while operating costs are covered by private donors.</p>
      <p>In a new promo video, Wilson tells “Bitcoin owners, cryptocurrency fanatics and alternative financing fans” to donate.</p>
      <p>Wilson has been working with the Mona Foundation for over 10 years. He’s ready to help the organization take a boatload of bananas off anyone’s hands.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I hope you’ll consider giving your worthless cryptocurrency to the Mona Foundation.”</i>
