      <h1>The Voice: Gwen Stefani Looked "Good as Hell" Performing a Lizzo Cover With Her Team</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Gwen-Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a> feels "Good as Hell," and she wants the world to know it. On Tuesday night's episode of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/The-Voice"><b>The Voice</b></a>, Stefani joined her team members — Joana Martinez, Myracle Holloway, and Rose Short — on stage to perform Lizzo's hit for a live audience. Their rendition was so energetic, the team had Stefani's fellow judges bopping in their seats — except <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Kelly-Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a>, who stood and danced along the whole time!</p>
      <p>It's a rare treat for <b>The Voice</b>'s judges to perform with their team throughout the course of a season. Stefani and Clarkson both had the chance to belt it out with their crew on Nov. 19, and it's likely <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/John-Legend">John Legend</a> and Blake Shelton will follow suit. Maybe we'll get a coaches quartet before the season finale, too! We'd love <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/voice-coaches-more-than-words-performance-video-46618020">a "More Than Words" reprise</a>. Watch Stefani's awesome Lizzo cover above.</p>
