          <b>I rarely purchase clothes through <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/amazon">Amazon</a>, but I was tempted to see if I could find a great pair of affordable jeans.</b>

      <p>Jean shopping isn’t easy. I’ve tried countless fits, washes, and styles over the years, and have yet to find my perfect pair, though I did come close with a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/clothing-rental-box-nuuly-and-it-changed-how-i-shop-2019-9">$245 pair from a clothing rental service</a>.</p>
      <p>I usually like to try clothes on in the store to ensure they fit before buying them, especially when it comes to jeans. However, this week, I decided to try something a little different.</p>
      <p>I shop on Amazon for most things, from laundry detergent to socks and cookware. However, I rarely buy clothes through the global online retailer.</p>
      <p>I decided to put Amazon’s reviews sections and incredible prices to the test and order the highest-rated pair of jeans on Amazon under $25, not including taxes and fees.</p>
      <p>Here’s what happened when I tried a pair of Amazon-approved jeans.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>First, I adjusted my search filters to find the best pair under $25.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>I made sure every pair I was viewing had received an average rating of more than four stars and was priced under $25. I also only considered jeans that could be delivered with Prime shipping.</p>
      <p>Right away, I noticed a couple of pairs that were more out-of-the-box than I was going for. For this experiment, I was looking for a pair of classic jeans that would never go out of style and maybe, just maybe, last for years.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>It was then that I decided on a pair of Signature by Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Gold Label skinny jeans.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd6a013fd9db23ba54c2315.png"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Marked as an “Amazon’s Choice” item, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Signature-Levi-Strauss-Gold-Label/dp/B07L9PYXTZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=newsroom_affiliate_112119_highest-rated-jeans-amazon-20&amp;amp;linkId=c4910485afb98e85080d42c218eba203&amp;amp;language=en_US">the jeans were $24.99 with Prime shipping</a>. I ordered them in a size 6 regular, my usual size, in a medium to dark wash.</p>
      <p>I figured these jeans would be a safe bet and they looked like they would be decent quality. Knowing the Levi brand, I had high hopes for the jeans.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The jeans had an average 4.5-star rating from 3,829 reviews, which was extremely positive compared to other jeans I saw on the site.</h3>

      <p>One <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077R57GTT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1#customerReviews">reviewer</a> said she loved them so much, she wanted a second pair, while others showed off their jeans in photo reviews.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>When my jeans arrived, I was excited to see how they would compare to other skinny jeans I’ve purchased in the past.</h3>

      <p>When I removed them from the Amazon package, I immediately liked what I saw. They seemed high quality.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>They were well-packaged and didn’t look like they had ever been tried on.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>This was definitely a plus, as I’ve tried jeans on in-store before and felt like they weren’t as fresh as they could have been after being tried on multiple times.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The stitching looked well-done, and the actual material of the jeans was thick.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The pockets also appeared well-constructed.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Examining them more, I really liked the slightly-faded wash and the fabric.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>These felt like really good quality jeans – even more so than pricier jeans I currently own.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Slipping them on, they had the perfect amount of stretch.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Honestly, these jeans fit me better than any other jeans I’ve ever owned – including my <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/newsroom_affiliate_112119_highest-rated-jeans-amazon/https://www.madewell.com/roadtripper-jeans-in-jansen-wash-K1877.html">$75 Roadtripper jeans from Madewell</a>.</p>
      <p>They were tight but didn’t dig in anywhere. When it comes to skinny jeans, it can be hard to escape that “10-pound sausage in a 5-pound bag” feeling, but I felt confident in these.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Sometimes when buying cheap jeans, you end up with something similar to a legging. However, these were clearly well-made.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>They came with four pockets, a button, and a zip. They were comfortable, very flattering, and true to size. I also think that people one size higher or lower could most likely fit into them, due to the stretch of the fabric.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>My colleagues, upon hearing I was reviewing jeans from Amazon, asked if they could feel how thick they were — and they were impressed.</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Me wearing the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Gold Label skinny jeans.<cite>Caroline Fox/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Everyone was pleasantly surprised at the quality – and wanted to order a pair for themselves.</p>
      <p>Not only was I impressed with my purchase, but I would buy more pairs of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Signature-Levi-Strauss-Gold-Label/dp/B07L9PYXTZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=newsroom_affiliate_112119_highest-rated-jeans-amazon-20&amp;amp;linkId=c4910485afb98e85080d42c218eba203&amp;amp;language=en_US">Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Gold Label skinny jeans</a> in other colors. My only note is that while the jeans were marketed as “mid-rise,” I felt they were more high-waisted since they went up past my belly button.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>I would rate these jeans 5 stars, especially considering they were under $25.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Paired with blazers or a going-out top, I know I’m going to get a ton of wear out of them.</p>
      <p>Next time you’re in the market for a pair of jeans, maybe consider checking out Amazon’s clothing selection. You might just find your new go-to pair.</p>
