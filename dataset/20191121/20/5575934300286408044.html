      <p>The Victoria’s Secret fashion show, which has aired annually around the holidays since 1995, is officially cancelled this year.</p>
      <p>The lingerie brand’s parent company, L Brands, confirmed the fate of the iconic show in an earnings call on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We’ll be communicating to customers, but nothing that I would say is similar in magnitude to the fashion show,” L Brands CFO Stuart Burgdoerfer said.</p>
      <p>He made the remark in response to a question about how the company planned to make up for the publicity that typically accompanied the iconic show.</p>
      <p>“Did we see specific material impact on short term sales response to the airing of the fashion show? As a general matter, the answer to that question is no,” Burgdoerfer said. “So if you’re like, ‘Oh my God, Stuart, are you freaked out about the day after the fashion show result and what’s going to happen?’ – it did air at different times over the years and we didn’t see a material impact on the next few days’ results.”</p>
      <p>The annual fashion show, which features top models called “angels” wearing lingerie, has seen a severe decline in viewership over the last several years.</p>
      <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/victorias-secret-fashion-show-2018-viewership-drops-2018-12">3.3 million people tuned in</a> to watch the show, down from 9.7 million viewers in 2013.</p>
      <p>Victoria’s Secret model Shanina Shaik said in July that the lingerie brand had cancelled this year’s fashion show. The company refused to comment on or confirm her remarks at the time.</p>
      <p>L Brands previously revealed that it was thinking about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/victorias-secret-might-kill-fashion-show-report-2019-5">making changes</a> to the annual fashion show, but didn’t say whether it would be outright cancelled.</p>
      <p>L Brands CEO Les Wexner said in a memo to employees that the company didn’t think “network television is the right fit” for the show.</p>
      <p>He said the company is rethinking “literally everything” about its business and is focusing on “developing exciting and dynamic content and a new kind of event – delivered to our customers on platforms that she’s glued to.”</p>
