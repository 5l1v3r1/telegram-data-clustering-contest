      <p>While commonly referred to as Baby Yoda, the 900-year-old Yoda had already become one with The Force years before <i>The Mandalorian's</i> timeframe. The creature's connection to the Jedi Master, if any, has yet to be revealed.</p>
      <p>Created by Jon Favreau, <i>The Mandalorian</i> stars Pedro Pascal, Gina Carano, Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposito, Emily Swallow, Omid Abtahi, Werner Herzog and Nick Nolte. The first two episodes are streaming now on Disney+.</p>
