      <h1>Parents urged to invest in their children</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:05:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:05</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Owusu Duodu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sefwi Debiso (WN/R) Nov 21, GNA-Apostle Robert Kwabena Andoh, Sefwi Essam-Debiso Area Head of the Church of Pentecost, has called on Parents to spend quantity time and resources towards the upbringing of their children.</p>
      <p>He said marriages, families and homes, formed the basis for the survival of every society hence there was the need to churn out well nurtured, well cultured and disciplined children to grow into responsible adulthood and citizenry.</p>
      <p>Apostle Andoh said this at the closing session of a marriage seminar organised as part of activities to mark this year’s Area Week Celebration of the church at Sefwi Debiaso, in the Bia West District of the Western North region.</p>
      <p>The theme for the celebration was, “Possessing the Nation, Through Transformed Marriages”.</p>
      <p>He noted that when parents spent quality time and money towards their children’s upbringing and education, the nation and the larger world would benefit immensely, however, if parents neglected their responsibility, the larger society suffered.</p>
      <p>“Most of the hardened criminals such as armed robbers, thieves, drug addicts and prostitutes, tormenting our lives today, could be traced to the effect of broken marriages and homes, which leave the children without proper care, control and emotional security and stability and thus, seek  solace in bad companies, groups and unscrupulous individuals” he lamented.</p>
      <p>The Area Head therefore, urged parents and Ghanaians in general, to help build strong and successful marriages and families because they formed the foundation of societal stability, growth and development.</p>
      <p>“When we succeed at home, our schools, churches, workplaces and the larger Ghanaian society, we will also be successful, and make our nation a better place to live in,” the Man of God admonished.</p>
      <p>For his part, Pastor Paul Asante, Debiso District Pastor of the Church of Pentecost, urged the participants at the programme, to put all lessons learnt into practice and begin to make a difference in all their endeavours, in order to impact positively on the society.</p>
