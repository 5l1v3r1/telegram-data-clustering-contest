      <p>Police have shared these pictures of a van which overturned on the M4.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on the busy road near <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/morriston">Morriston</a>, Swansea on Thursday evening. Traffic monitors showed slow traffic on the M4 eastbound at Ynysforgan.</p>
      <p>Tweeting the images at 7.17pm, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/south-wales-police">South Wales Police</a> wrote: "Luckily all occupants walked away with just minor injuries as they were wearing seatbelts. A quick check of the tyres shows a possible cause. Always check your tyres and always wear a seatbelt."</p>
      <p>Shortly afterwards, there was an accident on the M4 which left the Briton Ferry Bridge partially blocked and caused very slow traffic.</p>
