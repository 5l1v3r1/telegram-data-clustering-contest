      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telefonica">Telefonica </a>has signed a contract to use the so-called last-mile network of its U.S. ival <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/at-t">AT&amp;T </a>in Mexico, the local chief executive of the Spanish telecommunications company said on Thursday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telefonica">Telefonica </a>Mexico CEO Camilo Aya said the deal with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/at-t">AT&amp;T </a>was not exclusive and that the Spanish company's traffic would remain completely separate from that of its U.S. competitor.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>compete in Mexico with America Movil, the company controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, which has long dominated the telephone market in Latin America's no. 2 economy.</p>
      <p>Aya said the agreement was part of a trend that was taking place globally to better position <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>against rivals.</p>
      <p>"You need a lot of scale to compete in this business," Aya told reporters at an event in Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Miguel Calderon, vice president of regulation at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telefonica">Telefonica </a>Mexico, said the deal would ensure the firm remained in Mexico.</p>
      <p>The company was open to working with the Mexican government on its telecom projects, Calderon added.</p>
