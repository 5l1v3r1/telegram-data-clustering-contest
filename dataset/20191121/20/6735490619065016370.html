      <p>Kathie Lee Gifford was looking for a sense of community following the death of her husband.</p>
      <p>The former “Today” show host opened up about her life after Frank Gifford’s passing in an interview with <i><a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/franklin/2019/11/15/kathie-lee-gifford-nashville-because-she-was-dying-loneliness/2554705001">Nashville</a></i><a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/franklin/2019/11/15/kathie-lee-gifford-nashville-because-she-was-dying-loneliness/2554705001"><i> Tennessean</i></a>. Gifford, 66, said she yearned for a sense of community in the aftermath of her husband’s death in 2015. That prompted her to move from Connecticut to Nashville.</p>

      <p>“I moved here because I was dying of loneliness,” she explained. “It’s a culture of kindness in Nashville,” she continued, describing locals as “authentically kind” and “joyful.” Of her Connecticut mansion, she said, “that huge beautiful memory-filled home was like a morgue to me.”</p>
      <p>Gifford also touched on how her family life, or lack thereof, allows her more time to pursue writing and other projects.</p>

      <p>“Here’s the bad news – I’m a widow, an orphan, and an empty-nester. The good news is, I have the freedom of a widow, an orphan and an empty-nester,” she said. “I’ve got all the time to spend my days writing. I’m having the life I could’ve only ever dreamed of.”</p>
      <p>Frank died of natural causes at his Greenwich, Connecticut home, a week before his 85th birthday. Gifford and her husband share two children: Cody, 29, and Cassidy Erin, 26.</p>
