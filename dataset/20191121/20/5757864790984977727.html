      <p>If there's any life in this solar system outside Earth, we likely won't find it on Mars or even on another planet. Saturn's moon Titan is the place in our celestial neighborhood that's most similar to our own home, and it's where scientists think we have one of the best chances of discovering life. Now, as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03539-8"><i>Nature</i></a> reports, newly visualized data shows just how much Titan has in common with Earth.</p>
      <p>Between 2004 and 2017, the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7542">NASA</a> spacecraft Cassini performed more than 100 fly-bys of Saturn's moon. Titan is unique in that it's the <a href="https://www.space.com/15257-titan-saturn-largest-moon-facts-discovery-sdcmp.html">only moon</a> in the solar system with clouds and a dense, weather-forming atmosphere. This has made it hard to study from space, but by flying close to the surface, Cassini was able to capture the landscape in an unprecedented level of detail.</p>

      <p>NASA's new map of Titan, published in the journal <i>Nature Astronomy</i>, reveals a varied world of mountains, valleys, plains, and sandy dunes that starkly contrast with the desolate wastelands we've seen on neighboring planets. It's also home to seas and lakes, making it the only place in the solar system other than Earth with known bodies of liquid. But instead of water, the pools mottling the moon's surface consist of liquid methane.</p>
      <p>Even with its Earth-like geology and atmosphere, chances of finding life on Titan are still slim: Temperatures on the surface average around <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/first-map-earths-deranged-twin-and-saturns-moon-titan-completed-180973607/">-300°F</a>. If life does exist there, it's likely limited to microbes in the moon's craters and icy volcanoes.</p>
      <p>It will be a while before NASA is able to study Titan up close again: NASA's next drone mission to the body is set for <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasas-dragonfly-will-fly-around-titan-looking-for-origins-signs-of-life">2034</a>. Until then, scientists have plenty of data recorded by Cassini to teach them more about how the moon formed and continues to change.</p>
