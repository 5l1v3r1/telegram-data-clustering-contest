      <p><i>‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling be both desert runners end with R? So much imagination!‚Äù </i>Unfortunately so, dear reader; it appears that Volkswagen has been slacking a bit with the nomenclature. The Ford Motor Company has an excuse because they were first, but then again, let‚Äôs not forget that VW has the Golf R. It‚Äôs a bit of a hodgepodge when you think about it, so let‚Äôs turn the page over to the 4x4 racer.</p>
      <p>Atlas Cross Sport R has little in common with the five-seat version of <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/volkswagen-produces-100000th-atlas-in-chattanooga-129224.html">the Atlas</a> mid-sized crossover, and the changes start with the totally different chassis. A 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder engine with WRC and Rallycross know-how is hiding under the hood, capable of cranking out 600 horsepower. Because reliability is of utmost importance in the scorching heat of Mexico‚Äôs deserts, Volkswagen decided to detune the plant to approximately 480 horsepower. Remember, crossing the finishing line is more important than breaking down next to a cactus and a teeny-weeny armadillo.</p>
      <p>The vehicle in the photo gallery is a testbed for further development before the 2020 Baja 1000, and the man in charge of the steering wheel is Tanner Foust. The ARX Rallycross champion has also introduced the Atlas Cross Sport R during the Los Angeles Auto Show, and he‚Äôs <i>‚Äúitching to get behind the wheel.‚Äù </i>Can‚Äôt blame him for the enthusiasm given that he‚Äôs familiar with the drivetrain.</p>
      <p>Called Teramont X in China, the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport-revealed-with-bling-bling-exhaust-finishers-138215.html">Atlas Cross Sport</a> for North America was previewed six (!!!) years ago by the CrossBlue Coupe concept. The 2.0 TSI comes standard, and the most suck-squeeze-bang-blow on offer is 276 horsepower for the V6 engine. Speaking of which, the mill is actually a VR6 with a 15-degree angle between the cylinder banks. Looking back at the history of this interesting engine design, the VR layout was pioneered by Lancia with the V4 series in the 1920s.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúVolkswagens competed at the very beginning of Baja racing, and we‚Äôre excited to help keep the fun, youthful spirit of the competition alive,‚Äù</i> said senior vice president of marketing Saad Chehab. The Atlas Cross Sport R will contest the Class 7 Open Production Unlimited competition for race trucks, and the Baja 1000 is planned to kick off on November 19th. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>20 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>Volkswagen will return to the prestigious off-road race next year, entering an Atlas Cross Sport R race truck in Class 7 Open Production Unlimited. Unveiled today at the LA Auto Show, the prototype race truck is the first look at the vehicle that will compete in the SCORE Baja 1000 next November.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúRacing as a sport has historically been limited to a very privileged group,‚Äù said Saad Chehab, Senior Vice President, VW Brand Marketing. ‚ÄúHowever, Volkswagens competed at the very beginning of Baja racing, and we‚Äôre excited to help keep the fun, youthful spirit of the competition alive by way of our Atlas Cross Sport R.‚Äù</p>
        <p>Developed in conjunction with VW driver Tanner Foust and Baja race veteran Rhys Millen, the Atlas Cross Sport R will be the first four-wheel-drive vehicle to enter Baja Class 7 competition. Power will be distributed to the wheels from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, first developed by Volkswagen Motorsport for use in its WRC and Rallycross programs. Capable of running up to 600 horsepower‚Äîor 300 hp per liter‚Äîthe engine will be detuned to roughly 480 horsepower for an optimized balance of performance and reliability. Currently in concept form, the vehicle is being tested for further development and finalization before the 2020 race.</p>
        <p>Fresh off his victory as 2019 ARX Rallycross champion, Tanner Foust helped introduce the Atlas Cross Sport R during Volkswagen‚Äôs LA Auto Show press conference. Foust, who will also be one of the drivers, said: ‚ÄúI know what this combination of engine and drivetrain is capable of. I‚Äôm really excited to see this bit of Beetle DNA live on in the Atlas Cross Sport R and am itching to get behind the wheel.‚Äù</p>
        <p>Driving the ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs racing event‚Äù spirit of the Baja a step further, Volkswagen will invite designers from schools and colleges nationwide to participate in the design of the Atlas Cross Sport R‚Äôs race livery. Full details on the competition will be released in early 2020.</p>
        <p>Even though a race program might seem to stray away from Volkswagen‚Äôs commitment to the environment and meeting the goals of the 2050 Paris Climate Accord, the Baja program will be fully carbon neutral thanks to a carbon offset initiative via The Conservation Fund. This will plant more than 1,000 trees, or one per mile raced.</p>
