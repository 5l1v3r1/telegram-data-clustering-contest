      <h2>A high school senior in Zimmerman, Minnesota, recently made a touching tribute to her best friend who passed away last year.</h2>

      <p>Haley Donley and Heather Doucette had been close friends since elementary school. “We did pretty much everything together. And we’re still together,” Haley <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/land-of-10000-stories/student-poses-for-senior-photo-with-best-friend-killed-in-car-crash/89-6ad6fd13-0f28-4607-ba46-71edaeef7d8f">told</a> KARE 11.</p>
      <p>Tragically, Heather died in a single-car rollover accident on a slippery road near Cloquet in 2018. Her mother, who was driving at the time, and Heather’s younger sister survived the crash but suffered from serious injuries.</p>
      <p>“Most devastating phone call I’ve ever gotten in my life, for sure,” Haley <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZwWJVrEaqg">said</a> of the day she lost her friend.</p>
      <p>“Heather was a part of her. They were more than best friends, they were sisters,” Haley’s mother, Lori Donley, said of their close bond.</p>
      <p>Since they met in fifth grade, their yearbook photos had always been side by side. This year, Haley wanted to use her senior photo as a way to remember her best friend, so she posed while holding a beautiful portrait of Heather.</p>
      <p>When it came time for Haley’s <a href="http://www.jackiv.com/">photographer</a>, Jacki Vaughn, to help the senior choose a picture for the yearbook, the teenager knew exactly which one she wanted.</p>
      <p>“I was stunned,” Vaughn said when Haley chose the portrait of herself and her best friend’s photo. “Haley just pointed and said, ‘That’s the one. That’s the one I want for my senior picture.’ And then I cried.”</p>
      <p>Vaughn contacted the school to get permission to print the photo in the yearbook with both girl’s names underneath, and they agreed.</p>
      <p>“Now she’ll be right there next to me in the yearbook like we’ve dreamed of since fifth grade,” the graduating senior commented.</p>
      <p>Heather’s mom, Amanda Valerius, said Haley’s love and loyalty towards her daughter means everything to her.</p>
      <p>“It’s been kind of bittersweet watching her friends posting all their senior pics. Now I got to see my baby girl on a senior photo,” she stated.</p>
      <p>“The only way to get her to graduate with me was bring her along,” Haley said, adding, “I appreciate her being my best friend the years we had together.”</p>
