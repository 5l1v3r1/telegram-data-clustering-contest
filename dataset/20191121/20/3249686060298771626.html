      <p>1.Even on a week day the seats are all full</p>
      <p>2.They are the best</p>
      <p>3.Pearl red never dies</p>
      <p>4.TVXQ is the tour king</p>
      <p>5.Wow, it's a week day. Great!</p>
      <p>6.What's TVXQ's charm? (I'm not trying to downgrade them, I just wonder how a group can still have a lot of loyal fans in a foreign country for over 10 years)</p>
      <p>7.No group can match TVXQ's stage presence</p>
      <p>8.Wow, even the most popular J-pop artists can't fill the venue in a week day</p>
      <p>9.TVXQ is really a big idol for their juniors</p>
      <p>10.Honestly their stage performances are much better than the album. They are sweeping all the money away</p>
      <p>11.It's a week day, most of people in Japan work until night</p>
      <p>12.They even sold the limited-view seats. How can people watch them?</p>
      <p>13.They're performing there for 3 week days, all of them were sold out, even limited view seats.</p>
      <p>14.Wow, is this possible?</p>
      <p>15.165,000 spectators in 3 days.</p>
      <p>16.Let's sweep the YEN away~</p>
      <p>17.They've been doing this only with 2 people...</p>
