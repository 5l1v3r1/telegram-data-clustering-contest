      <h1>TTC to retire its CLRV streetcars on Dec. 29</h1>

      <p>The TTC is retiring its fleet of Canadian Light Rail Vehicle (CLRV) streetcars, which have been in service for four decades, at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The CLRVs will make their final run on Dec. 29, the transit agency said in a news release on Thursday, adding that with the retirement, all TTC bus and streetcar routes will be serviced by accessible vehicles</p>
      <p>Starting on Nov. 24, CLRVs will operate on 511 Bathurst seven days a week until Dec 28. In addition, CLRVs will also be deployed as an extra service on 501 Queen on weekends between Roncesvalles Avenue and Greenwood Avenue.</p>
      <p>The first CLRV arrived on Dec. 29, 1977, and went into service two years later on the 507 Long Branch route, the transit agency said.</p>
      <p>According to the TTC, a total of 196 CLRV streetcars were purchased with the last one delivered in 1982.</p>
      <p>For those who want to hitch a final ride on the CLRVs, the TTC said you must enter a contest on their Instagram and Facebook pages between Dec. 2 and Dec. 6.</p>
      <p>Ten winners from each social media platform will be randomly selected and awarded a seat for them and a guest on the final CLRV ride, the agency said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the TTC retired the last of its <a href="https://www.cp24.com/news/ttc-to-retire-its-final-two-articulated-streetcars-on-monday-1.4570391?cache=%3FclipId%3D64268">'bendy' streetcars</a>.</p>
      <p>The agency said its 204 Bombardier low-floor streetcars will replace the fleet.</p>
