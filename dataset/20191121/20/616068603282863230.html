      <p>The Penticton Fire Department is announcing a new open burning bylaw, as well as taking the opportunity for a seasonal reminder about safety during the holiday season. </p>
      <p>A new Open Burning Smoke Control Regulation came into effect in September, which prompted a change to the fire department's bylaws to stay current. </p>
      <p>"The new open burning smoke control regulation focuses on air quality risk minimization,” said fire prevention officer Cpt. Mike Richards. </p>
      <p>“The objectives of the new regulation encourage compliance and reducing the impact on human health, while still supporting the agricultural industry in their operations.”</p>
      <p>All open burning permits issued prior to January 2020 have been rescinded. Updated open burning permits are now available at the Penticton Fire Department Station 201, commencing the effective date of Jan. 1 2020.</p>
      <p>Some of the changes to the Open Burning Bylaw include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Availability of special permits for diseased vegetation, wildfire risk reduction and land clearing through new cleaner burning technologies, custom ventilation forecasting and alternative measures.</li>
        <li>Smoke complaints will be regulated under the Good Neighbor Bylaw 2012-5030, Part 8 Nuisance Smoke and OBSCR (both provide for penalties)</li>
        <li>Updated list of prohibited burning materials</li>
        <li>Smoke Sensitivity Zones (SSZ) defined as High, Medium and Low – Penticton is classified as a “High Sensitivity Zone”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The changes to the bylaw only apply to the Penticton Fire Department Protection Area, not the RDOS. For more information, Richards can be reached at mike.richards@penticton.ca.</p>
      <p>Richards has also provided the public with a list of safety precautions during the holiday, addressing common safety hazards associated with indoor and outdoor holiday decorations. </p>
      <p>Fire and electrical accidents become more likely during the holiday season. </p>
      <p>"Avoid a tragic festive time of year,” Richards said. “Enjoy a fire-safe holiday season by following simple safety precautions.”</p>
      <p>His tips are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Carefully inspect each electrical decoration for cracked or frayed sockets bare wires, and loose connections that may cause a serious shock or start a fire. Follow the use and care instructions that accompany your electrical decorations.</li>
        <li>Stapling or nailing through electrical wires or extension cords may damage the wire or insulation, which could cause electrical shock or fire.</li>
        <li>Check packaging to determine the maximum number of strings that may be linked together. Avoid overloading electrical outlets.</li>
        <li>Turn off electrical light strings, candles, and other decorations before leaving home or going to bed. Automatic timers are available for both indoor and outdoor applications.</li>
        <li>Waterproof all electrical connections, and keep them elevated so that water won’t drain into the connection and cause a shock or a short circuit.</li>
        <li>Use lights that are approved by an independent testing laboratory, such as Underwriters/CSA.</li>
        <li>Be sure chimney and fireplaces have been inspected and cleaned.</li>
        <li>Whenever possible, choose holiday decorations made with flame-resistant, flame-retardant or non-combustible materials.</li>
        <li>Inflatable outdoor ornaments can easily become dangerous projectiles.  Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for securing them.  It is best to shut off the fan blowers when it’s windy, when you are not going to be home for long periods or at bedtime.</li>
        <li>Have working smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, develop and practice a Home Escape Plan.</li>
      </ul>
