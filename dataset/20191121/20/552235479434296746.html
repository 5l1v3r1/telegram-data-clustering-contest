      <p>A young girl has been taken to hospital after being knocked down in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilwinning</a> tonight.</p>
      <p>The town's big Christmas lights switch-on has been overshadowed following the incident on Lauchlan Way.</p>
      <p>Police were called at approximately 6.55pm with reports of a female having been struck by a vehicle.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Paramedics raced to the scene and have taken the youngster to Kilmarnock's Crosshouse Hospital, police confirmed to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Ayrshire Live.</a></p>
      <p>The age of the girl and her condition are unknown at this stage and the road remains closed as officers try to establish exactly what happened.</p>
      <p>Stagecoach West Scotland informed passengers that the closure meant their No 11 and 25A services would be diverted.</p>
