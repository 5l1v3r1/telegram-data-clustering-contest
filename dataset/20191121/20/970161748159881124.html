      <p>A frightened child sex abuse victim tried to hide behind her pet dog to stop a pedophile abusing her, police say.</p>
      <p>The stricken girl unsuccessfully attempted to use the animal to build a barrier between herself and alleged pervert Juan Manrique, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Manrique, 37, is said to have attacked the girl, who was aged around 13 or 14, while he thought she was sleeping at her home in Wichita Falls, Texas.</p>
      <p>He is on trial this week, with the court told Wednesday how his alleged abuse came to light when his young victim was taken to a nurse suffering from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anxiety/">anxiety</a>.</p>
      <p>That visit, in August 2016, led to the girl telling the nurse and her mother about what had happened, and he was subsequently arrested.</p>
      <p>Indictments seen by <a href="https://www.timesrecordnews.com/story/news/2019/11/20/manrique-trial-24-counts-child-sex-crimes/4252889002/">Times Record News</a> allege that Manrique molested that girl and her older sister, who was around the same age when the attacks allegedly began.</p>

      <p>He reportedly began abusing one of the two girls in 2010, with his relationship to them not disclosed to protect the girls’ identities.</p>
      <p>Speaking in court Wednesday, the older girl said the attacks had left her suicidal.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘I would always think about taking pills or cutting myself enough. I just didn’t want to be alive anymore.’</p>
      <p>The other girl was reportedly targeted by Manrique from February 2016 to August 2016, and is said to have been attacked a total of 52 times.</p>
      <p>Both girls are said to have suffered intimate touching and sexual assaults at the hands of their abuser.</p>
      <p>Manrique faces 24 counts of continuous sexual abuse of a child, indecency with a child, and aggravated sexual assault of a child.</p>
      <p>He has been held in jail in lieu of $2million since March 2017, and faces spending the rest of his life behind bars if convicted of all counts he faces.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
