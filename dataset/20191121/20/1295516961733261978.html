      <p>The Rock says... the Justice Society of America are coming to the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-adam-film/">Black Adam</a> movie!</p>
      <p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson -- who is set to star as Black Adam in the DC Comics villain/anti-hero's upcoming solo film -- has confirmed that while the movie will not feature an appearance by Zachary Levi's Shazam, it will introduce DC's original superhero team to the DC Extended Universe: the JSA.</p>

      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/black-adam-movie-jsa-justice-society-dceu/">Screen Rant</a>, Johnson was asked if <i>Black Adam</i> would see a confrontation between the titular character and Levi's Shazam. "Without giving too much away, it’s not in the plans right now," he replied. "I think the approach that we’re talking I feel really good about, and all of the filmmakers do too as well. It’s an origin story and that’s where we start it and we root it, and then we build out from there. Now, not to say Shazam isn’t on my radar. Of course Shazam is, but so is all of DC."</p>

      <p>It was at this point the Justice Society of America came up. "JSA," Johnson said. "We will introduce you to that, the world to JSA."</p>
      <p>Notably, the character of Black Adam has played a role in DC's <i>JSA</i> titles over the years. What's more, Shazam (formerly known as Captain Marvel) is fairly synonymous with the Justice Society a well, with the two arch-enemies even being members of the team at the same time at one point.</p>

      <p>That being said, it remains unclear how exactly the JSA will factor into Black Adam's cinematic origin story, as well as which members of the seminal superhero squad will actually be featured on-screen. As such, JSA fans will simply have to wait and see what <i>Black Adam</i> has in store for them when the film arrives in two years' time.</p>
      <p>Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, <i>Black Adam</i> stars Dwayne Johnson. The film is scheduled to arrive in theaters Dec. 22, 2021. Production is <a href="https://www.cbr.com/black-adam-production-start-date-dwayne-johnson/">expected to kick off</a> this July.</p>
