      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/blossoms-confirm-third-album-finished-say-inspired-talking-heads-primal-scream-2546485">Speaking to NME in September</a><i>,</i> Blossoms described the record as “a pure celebration of love in all of its splendid and baffling guises, toying with the so-called sins of lust and forbidden infatuation.”</p>
      <p>The album, which is reportedly inspired by <a href="http://nme.com/artists/talking-heads">Talking Heads</a>‘ ‘Stop Making Sense’, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/u2">U2</a>‘s ‘The Joshua Tree’ and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/primal-scream">Primal Scream</a>‘s ‘Screamadelica’, also features <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-two-new-songs-blossoms-your-girlfriend-2511765">their June single ‘Your Girlfriend’</a>.</p>

      <p>Although the record is still some weeks from release, the Stockport band have <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/blossoms-confirm-they-theyre-starting-working-on-album-number-4-next-month-2567524">already started working on its follow up</a>.</p>
      <p>Frontman Tom Ogden told Gordon Smart of <i>This Feeling TV</i>: “We’re going to America for Christmas so got to kind of do a few rehearsals for that. Then there’s boring stuff that goes into the album like picking the booklet photos.</p>
      <p>He then revealed: “We’re actually gonna go in the studio in December and start the next album.”</p>
