      <p>TORONTO — High school teachers in Ontario will start an administrative work-to-rule campaign on Tuesday, coinciding with similar job action by elementary teachers.</p>
      <p>Harvey Bischof, the president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation, says the campaign will also include information pickets, but they won't prevent or delay students from getting into schools.</p>
      <p>He says the job action will include not putting comments on report cards, not participating in standardized testing, and not taking part in unpaid staff meetings outside school hours.</p>
      <p>Education Minister Stephen Lecce announced earlier in the day he is backing off a plan to mandate that high school students take four online courses in order to graduate, instead requiring two.</p>
      <p>Bischof calls that "stumbling halfway towards the right solution."</p>
      <p>The major education unions are in bargaining with the province, and are expressing frustration with a lack of progress at the table.</p>
