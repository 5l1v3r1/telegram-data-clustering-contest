      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bruno-tonioli/">Bruno Tonioli</a> is saddened that the same sex routine on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/strictly-come-dancing-sex-routine-johannes-radebe-graziano-di-prima-sparks-200-complaints-bbc-11193004/">drawn almost 200 complaints from viewers.</a></p>

      <p>In a report about their most complained about moments of the month so far, the BBC revealed that 189 viewers had time on their hands to complain about a performance starring Strictly pros Johannes Radebe and Graziano Di Prima.</p>
      <p>The two men performed to Shine by Emeli Sande during a recent results show.</p>
      <p>Bruno, a judge on the hit Saturday night show, said described the news as ‘very sad’.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: ‘It’s hard to believe after such progress in society and many other topics going on that over 200 people felt so upset they complained when 2 men danced with each other… I just don’t know what to say… Very sad. #bbcstrictly.’</p>

      <p>Fellow pro Anton Du Beke told Metro.co.uk <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/strictly-come-dancings-anton-du-beke-defends-johannes-radebe-graziano-di-primas-sex-routine-amid-complaints-storm-11195219/">that he didn’t get what the fuss was about.</a></p>

      <p>‘As a dancer, you just dance. It’s a sort of creative process, you’re just dancing,’ Anton said of Johannes and Graziano’s routine. ‘That’s what you do as a performer, you create, we’re creating dance.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘I don’t think there’s anything controversial in the number itself. ‘I danced with Vincent Simone years ago on Strictly and I also did a number with Brucey [Forsyth].</p>
      <p>‘I can’t say why they complained, it’s their own personal opinion about it but dance is dance, they’re just dancing. That’s all it is. All you’re doing is performing and you hope people enjoy it.’</p>
      <p>The performance came after Strictly admitted back in August that they would be proud to welcome same-sex pairings in the future.</p>
      <p>‘Strictly Come Dancing is an inclusive show and we are proud to have featured same-sex dancing among the professional dancers in group numbers in previous series,’ a spokesperson told Metro.co.uk at the time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile ITV is set to make history on Dancing On Ice with Ian ‘H’ Watkins from Steps and skater Matt Evers forming the show’s first ever same sex pairing.</p>
