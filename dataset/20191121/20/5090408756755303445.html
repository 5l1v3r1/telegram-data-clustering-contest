      <h1>Elizabeth Warren is running for president in 2020. Here's everything we know about the candidate and how she stacks up against the competition., Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:32:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author">Eliza Relman, Business Insider US</a></address>
      <h3>Who is Elizabeth Warren?</h3>
      <p><b>Current job:</b> US Senator from Massachusetts. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-president-announcement-2020-election-shes-officially-running-for-2019-2">Running for president</a> of the United States as a Democratic candidate.</p>
      <p><b>Age: </b>70</p>
      <p><b>Family:</b> Warren is married to law professor Bruce Mann. She has two children, Amelia Warren Tyagi and Alexander Warren.</p>
      <p><b>Hometown:</b> Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</p>
      <p><b>Political party:</b> Democratic</p>
      <p><b>Previous jobs:</b> Advisor to President Barack Obama on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2010 to 2011. Chair of the congressional oversight panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) from 2008-2010. Tenured law professor at Harvard Law School from 1993 to 2013.</p>
      <h3>Who is Warren’s direct competition for the nomination?</h3>
      <p>Based on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Elizabeth Warren’s lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The average Warren-satisfied respondent said they were satisfied with <b>3.9 other candidates</b>, which is the third-lowest number of rivals for a candidate in the race. That’s pretty good: it means that people who like her tend to be narrowing down their choices. Still, only about 5 percent of Warren supporters said they were satisfied with her and her alone.</li>
        <li>Among Democratic primary voters, about half of those who’d be satisfied with Warren as nominee were <b>also satisfied with Joe Biden as nominee.</b> That is way down, from about two thirds early in the election cycle. Warren has carved out a constituency of her own, but a Biden candidacy that pans out will pose a significant threat to Warren’s ability to consolidate a constituency.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Those satisfied with Warren also would be satisfied with <b>fellow New England liberal <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bernie-sanders-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a>.</b> Of those satisfied with Warren as nominee, just shy of two thirds also would be satisfied with Sanders. That’s about 10 percentage points higher than Sander’s performance among general Democrats, who were satisfied with him a little more than half of the time.</li>
        <li>Those satisfied with Warren also saw the appeal in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-kamala-harris-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Kamala Harris</a>, but at a lower rate than among the total set of Democrats.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>INSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate’s constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.</p>

      <h3>What are Elizabeth Warren’s policy positions?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>healthcare</b>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>She introduced <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-colleagues-unveil-legislation-to-hold-insurance-companies-accountable-and-strengthen-consumer-protections">legislation</a> in 2018 that would limit profits for insurance companies and offer more financial assistance to those buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplace. She <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/17/elizabeth-warren-bill-drug-manufacturing-prices-1067916">introduced another bill</a> that would establish a government-run pharmaceutical manufacturer to bring down drug prices.</li>
            <li>Warren supports “Medicare for All,” which would provide every American with health insurance through Medicare while eliminating private insurers and virtually eliminating co-pays and deductibles.</li>
            <li>In October, Warren released a $20.5 trillion plan to pay for single-payer, which would significantly expand her wealth tax on the ultra-rich, impose new financial taxes, and have employers re-direct their healthcare contributions from private insurance companies to the government. It would not raise taxes on the middle-class.</li>
            <li>In November, Warren <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-proposes-a-transition-phase-before-medicare-for-all/2019/11/15/9765a1bc-06f8-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html">announced</a> she would pass a Medicare for All “option” that would open up Medicare to all Americans, but wouldn’t be mandatory. She would push for full single-payer later in her first term.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>immigration</b>:</p>

            <li>She <a href="https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-harris-floor-remarks-on-protecting-dreamers">supports</a> the Obama administration’s “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” (DACA) program, which protects young people who come to the US illegally as children.</li>
            <li>She co-sponsored <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2937">the 2018 HELP Separated Children Act</a> aimed at protecting immigrant children from enforcement actions.</li>
            <li>And she supports decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings.</li>
            <li>During the 2020 Democratic presidential debate in Detroit, Warren said, “The truth is, immigrants seeking refuge in our country aren’t a threat to national security. It’s time to end this draconian policy and return to treating immigration as a civil – not a criminal – issue.”</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>climate change </b>and <b>the environment</b>:</p>

            <li>In February 2019, Warren <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1093606058810056704">signed on to the Green New Deal resolution</a>, which aims to transition the US to 100% clean and renewable energy in 10 years, and stimulate the economy with millions of new jobs and an expanded social safety net.</li>
            <li>Warren <a href="https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2018/09/17/climate-risk-disclosure-act-warren">introduced a bill last year</a> that would require public companies to disclose information about how climate change might impact their business. She has a <a href="http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/elizabeth-warren">99% lifetime score</a>, based on her voting record, from the League of Conservation Voters.</li>
            <li>In April 2019, <a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-for-public-lands-e4be1d88a01c">Warren announced</a> she would sign an executive order fully banning drilling, including offshore, on public lands. She would also reinstate a rule limiting methane pollution, clean water regulations, and protections for national monuments.</li>
            <li>Warren has said <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/read-democratic-debate-transcript-november-20-2019-n1088186">she would hire 10,000</a> Americans to “to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change.”</li>

She would spend $3 trillion on climate efforts. She supports a tax on carbon as a way to cut emissions.</li>
            <li>Warren wants to spend <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/elizabeth-warren-environmental-justice-plan-to-combat-climate-change.html">$1 trillion over the next decade</a> on the country’s most vulnerable communities, with a focus on climate and environmental impacts on those populations.</li>

            <li>Setting her apart from the 2020 field, Warren <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-wont-hold-fundraisers-big-donors-2019-2">announced in February 2019</a> that she won’t hold fundraisers, calls, or special events with big donors during the course of her primary campaign and in the general election, should she become the nominee.</li>

            <li>She supports transgender individuals’ rights, including the right for prisoners to <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/elizabeth-warren-transgender-prisoners-lgbtq-record-352c3b445bba/">receive gender reassignment surgery</a>.</li>

      <h3>How is Elizabeth Warren viewed by voters compared to the competition?</h3>
      <p>INSIDER has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-political-spectrum-ranking-2019-5">how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates</a>, Warren was generally considered to be one of the more left-leaning candidates in the field, in fifth place out of a field of then 20. <b>Warren</b> is among the most experienced candidates in the field, coming in third place behind Sanders and Biden when we asked respondents to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-experienced-2020-democratic-candidates-ranked-by-voters-2019-6">rank the candidates based on</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-experienced-2020-democratic-candidates-ranked-by-voters-2019-6">how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency</a> given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. And when asked how <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-ranked-by-likability-2019-6">likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be</a>, Warren was considered emerged in the top five.</p>
      <h3>Could Elizabeth Warren beat President Trump?</h3>
      <p>Referring back to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-methodology">INSIDER’s recurring poll</a>, Warren overall was once believed to be an ordinary, if slightly weaker candidate in a general election against Donald Trump compared to the whole field. However, she’s now seen as a top-flight rival, with over half of Democrats thinking she’d beat the president. This growth was not mirrored among non-Democrats, who consider her a fairly ordinary Democratic candidate against the President.</p>
      <h3>How do Democratic voters feel about Elizabeth Warren’s qualifications?</h3>
      <p>INSIDER has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president.</p>
      <p>For example, among respondents who said they’d vote in the Democratic primary, 19% said a candidate being a college professor made them likelier to support them, while 4% said it made them less likely to, for a +15% net favorability. We can then see how different candidates’ resumes stack up compared to those preferences.</p>
      <p>Attributes perceived as most valuable include her released tax returns (+43%), position in the Senate (+40%), her growing up poor (+28%), past as an activist (+28%), consumer advocate (+18%), college professor (+15%) and lawyer (+3%).</p>
      <p>Attributes considered to be a liability based on the preferences of self-reported Democratic voters include that she is age 70 or over (-24%).</p>
