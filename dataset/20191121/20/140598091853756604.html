      <p>An American woman could be forced to register as a sex offender after appearing topless in front of her step-children in her own home.</p>
      <p>Tilli Buchanan, from Utah, was charged with three counts of misdemeanour lewdness involving a child after appearing topless along with the children's father in their home last year.</p>
      <p>Ms Buchanan's lawyers are contesting the charge, arguing it is unfair to treat men and women differently for baring her chest.</p>
      <p>She said she and her husband were working in their garage in late 2017 or early 2018 and removed their shirts to prevent them from getting dusty.  </p>
      <p>She told the court that when the children, aged nine and 13, entered the garage she “explained she considers herself a feminist and wanted to make a point that everybody should be fine with walking around their house or elsewhere with skin showing”.</p>
      <p>“It was in the privacy of my own home. My husband was right next to me in the same exact manner that I was, and he’s not being prosecuted,” she said after the court hearing.</p>
      <p>The charge occurred after child welfare officials began an investigation involving the children on an unrelated matter and the children’s mother reported the incident to authorities because she was “alarmed.”</p>
      <p>If convicted, Ms Buchanan could be required to register as a sex offender for 10 years. Her husband was not charged.</p>
      <p>Ms Buchanan's lawyers appeared in court on Tuesday to ask a judge to overturn the charges, arguing that they are unconstitutional.</p>
      <p>The lawyers cited a previous court ruling that overturned a Colorado ban on women going topless in public.</p>
      <p>However the prosecution said that in the US, nudity is commonly understood to include women's breasts.</p>
      <p>The judge in the case, Kara Pettit, declined to rule immediately on the case, saying it was “too important of an issue”. A ruling is expected in the next few months.</p>
