      <p>Former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion and fraud charges <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-baltimore-mayor-federally-indicted-in-wake-of-corruption-probe">a day after she was indicted</a>.</p>
      <p>Pugh, a 69-year-old Democrat, entered the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/former-baltimore-mayor-catherine-e-pugh-has-reached-an-agreement-to-plead-guilty-two-people-familiar-with-the-deal-say/2019/11/21/d3e8499e-0bd7-11ea-bd9d-c628fd48b3a0_story.html">pleas</a> in federal court Thursday. She pleaded guilty to four of the 11 charges levied against her for her alleged participation in a scheme involving sales of her self-published children’s book series, <i>Healthy Holly</i>.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say that Pugh defrauded Baltimore businesses and nonprofits with about $800,000 in sales of her books. Pugh <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/baltimore-mayor-quits-over-childrens-books-corruption-scandal">resigned from public office</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Officials from the IRS and FBI raided Baltimore City Hall and her house in April during their three-year criminal investigation. Pugh was allegedly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for copies of the books from the University of Maryland Medical Center in a no-bid deal while she still served on UMMC’s board. She <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/baltimore-mayor-takes-indefinite-leave-of-absence-for-health-amid-book-scandal">resigned from the board</a> after the investigation began.</p>
      <p>Two other people, Pugh’s former aide, 38-year-old Gary Brown Jr., and 50-year-old Roslyn Wedington, who ran a nonprofit linked to the case, also pleaded guilty to federal charges as part of the investigations.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors said Pugh evaded thousands of dollars in taxes. While running for mayor in 2016, she told the IRS she made just $31,000 when her income was actually closer to $322,000.</p>
      <p>On May 2, after Pugh resigned, Jack Young became the new mayor of Baltimore.</p>
