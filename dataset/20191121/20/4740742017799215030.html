      <h1>What top stars are being paid on iTV's I'm a Celebrity 2019</h1>
      <h2>Ian Wright and Nadine Coyle are among the highest-paid celebrities</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:22:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Bevan, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>We all love to watch famous faces being scared to death as they have to eat live cockroaches or walk through a tank of snakes.</p>
      <p>But don't have too much sympathy for them because it turns out the stars on I'm A Celebrity are actually being paid a small fortune to take on through the gruelling challenges.</p>
      <p>Indeed, like the tasks set before the celebs in the regular Bushtucker Trails, some of the amounts are eye-watering, reports <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/what-caitlyn-jenner-jacqueline-jossa-17284954">Wales Online.</a></p>
      <p>American television personality Caitlyn Jenner will be earning around £500,000 – one of the highest figures ever paid - Bristol's <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/noel-edmonds">Noel Edmonds</a> was the only other participant to match that sum.</p>

      <p>Close behind Jenner is ex-footballer-turned-sports pundit Ian Wright, who's reportedly netting £400,000.</p>
      <p>And Girls Aloud songstress Nadine Coyle is taking home a whopping £250,000.</p>
      <p>Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway and former <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/eastenders">EastEnders</a> acrtress Jacqueline Jossa are apparently making £75,000 each, with £50k going to both DJ Adele Roberts and retired England rugby player James Haskell.</p>

      <p>Some of the lowest earners include Capital FM DJ Roman Kemp who is being paid  £40,000 and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/x-factor-tv-start-date-269629?service=responsive">X Factor</a> winner Myles Stephenson gets £25,000.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it's thought <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star Andrew 'Kirk' Whyment will be entering the jungle later this week, thereby pocketing £100k for his trouble.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly joked: “Most people come into the jungle to lose a few pounds, but [Caitlyn’s] going to be gaining 500,000 of them according to the papers.”</p>
