        <b>Arsenal fans have taken to Twitter to react after Unai Emery suggested, <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/xhaka-feeling-better-and-wants-come-back">in comments reported by the club’s official website</a>, that Granit Xhaka could make his return this weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has almost been a month since the Swiss last played for the Gunners. His angry reaction as he left the field during the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace prompted many to suggest that he should not play for the club again.</p>

      <p>Xhaka has since lost the captaincy and not been involved in any of Arsenal’s last four games in all competitions. However, it appears that that run may soon come to an end.</p>
      <p>Emery suggested ahead of this weekend’s clash with Southampton that the 27-year-old is in contention to feature, and a decision about whether he will play will be made in the coming days.</p>

      <p>“He is feeling better and also feeling that his team is Arsenal now. He wants to come back with confidence with the supporters, and we are going to decide. But I think little by little we can help him come back and connect with us and our supporters,” <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/xhaka-feeling-better-and-wants-come-back">he told the club’s official website</a>.</p>
      <p>“We are going to decide tomorrow [whether he will be in the squad for Saturday] but I want to do that comeback, give him confidence and make him comfortable. And when we can connect with our supporters with a good moment and a good performance and being strong with them.”</p>
      <h3>Fan anger remains</h3>
      <p>Emery’s comments have left some of the Arsenal fans on social media divided. The minority appear to be extremely pleased about the prospect of Xhaka returning. They may well be hoping that the club can move past the recent events, and that Xhaka can silence his critics upon his return to the pitch.</p>
      <p>However, most Gunners supporters appear to have little interest in seeing Xhaka come back. They believe that the damage has been done and his focus should be on finding a new club for January.</p>
      <p>It must also be noted that Xhaka is not only the figure at the club that the fans want gone in the near future.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the supporters were saying on social media after Emery’s comments…</p>
