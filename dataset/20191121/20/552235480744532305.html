      <p>Le Mans president Thierry Gomez is "not unhappy" with rumours linking Stephane Diarra with a move to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>It was reported this week that the 20-year-old is on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> 's radar, with Leicester City and Newcastle United also said to be interested.</p>
      <p>French newspaper <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/stephane-diarra-monitored-celtic-brendan-20919809">L'Ã‰quipe stated</a> that the Hoops have been following the youngster for several seasons, and it appears his club are not issuing a hands off warning.</p>
      <p>Gomez told Ouest France: "Since we've got to Ligue 2 there's an enforced change of status.</p>

      <p>"We'll need to get used to these rumours. After that I'm not unhappy if some of our players are of interest to other clubs, that's just proof that we're working well.</p>
      <p>"So far we haven't had any offers. After that, Stephane knows where he's come from.</p>
      <p>"We went and got him from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rennes">Rennes</a> when he was having a difficult time, we've relaunched him well.</p>
      <p>"If something were to happen, it would happen with our support.</p>
      <p>"Right now this subject isn't on the agenda, we're heading into a period that can bring hope, but also danger, so let's focus on our next games."</p>
