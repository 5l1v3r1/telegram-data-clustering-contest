      <h1>Crazed fox that attacked people in New Jersey had rabies: officials</h1>

      <p>The crazed red fox that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/angry-fox-attacks-five-people-in-new-jersey-biting-spree/">bit several people in New Jersey</a> has tested positive for rabies, officials have warned.</p>
      <p>The fox had “direct contact” with at least four people in Glen Ridge — three of whom were treated for “bite-related injuries” — with police fearing more could be at risk who have not come forward.</p>
      <p>The violent mammal even tried to attack one of the cops who finally cornered it before it was killed on Friday.</p>
      <p>The fox has now tested positive for rabies, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/glenridgepd/posts/2536884339740870?__xts__[0]=68.ARCeUY8axA7tgZTkjtjrJ9s3zRFsytqQttxUkf7rs1me2GbFOsIqAy2ILhxpavTsc_F-GKdvFQP8DvN4cF1xzPTX4ivHawommGmVora41G49MD4gYPqeCHFowyN_fh50dnNHG7RGvgZ4r-j3-iXmzwno1XYQ8yXBqmGPy4gGIRJa4QgWqy6TjaWBDMMCySijg0v2IQzF3YFhcXDtyUhcmsXvolVry3dTt5iA8Llnw7VcAlkImWjPCtdkHU9vhMHoV_9bfkgboe_M68u9xpjWMMRl4AhXM8bTDg3ia4bLOqDjIh6Fdnj7sc1FixN-4-NsLzjOnWuc2bzFSp3Ky6EX3A&amp;__tn__=-R">officials confirmed Wednesday</a>, as they urged anyone attacked to come forward for urgent treatment — as well as vigilance for pets that may have been bitten, too.</p>
      <p>“Rabies is a deadly disease that with prompt treatment is 100 percent controllable but without prompt treatment becomes a fatal disease,” Glen Ridge police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, it is imperative to obtain prompt treatment following a bite or exposure to the saliva of an infected animal.”</p>
      <p>Pet owners were also advised to call the police if any pets or wild animals show “abnormal behavior” — with rabies potentially passed on to raccoons, skunks and free-roaming cats, the force said.</p>
      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/">calls rabies a “fatal but preventable”</a> viral disease that infects the central nervous system.</p>
      <p>“If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death,” the CDC warns.</p>
      <p>Treatment usually involves a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html">series of vaccines</a>, the center says.</p>
      <p>Initial reports said five people were attacked, but officials later revised that number to four.</p>
