      <h1>Google Cloud Print follows Reader and Inbox to the trash heap after 2020</h1>
      <h2>Now that Chrome OS has better printer support, the cloud service is shutting down.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:04:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>If there's anything Google loves as much as launching interesting new projects (say hello to Stadia and Duplex on the web!), it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/27/google-20-years-forgotten-products/">killing them off after a few years</a>, and now we have an end date for Google Cloud Print. The service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010/04/16/google-cloud-print-service-aims-for-unified-universal-web-print/">launched in 2010</a> as a way to make printers more accessible for Chrome OS, but <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/21/google-cloud-print-dead-2020/"><i>9to5Google</i></a> points out <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006">a post on the support site</a> that indicates its services are no longer needed.</p>
      <p>Google correctly notes that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/10/chrome-os-native-print/">it has improved native printer support on Chrome OS</a>, but Cloud Print has been a welcome link <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/13/cloud-print-app-google-play/">from all kinds of devices</a> to the printers we know, love and are endlessly frustrated by when they refuse to work. Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012/04/18/google-cloud-print-adds-fedex-canon-to-remote-printing-roster/">easy link to other services</a> came through in the clutch more than once, but now we're headed back to one-by-one setups and disparate printing apps.</p>
      <p>If you've come to rely on the service, then you have until the end of 2020 to work out an alternative, because when the lights come on in 2021 -- "devices across all operating systems will no longer be able to print using Google Cloud Print." Cloud Print never even made it out of beta status.</p>
