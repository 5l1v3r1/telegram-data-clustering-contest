      <h1>Stan Kroenke's £1.23bn decision that will leave Arsenal fans wondering where the money is</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal owner has invested heavily into the project</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:44:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:44</time> by <a rel="author">Connor O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>Stan Kroenke's new SoFi Stadium is set to open on July 25 2020, in Hollywood Park.</p>
      <p>The state of the art stadium includes 70,240-seats with a transparent dome that spans more than 3 million sq ft; a 6,000-seat performance centre that will anchor a 298-acre complex of office buildings, shops, restaurants, residential units, hotels, movie theatre and parks.</p>
      <p>The SoFi will mark the end of one NFL era in Los Angeles and the beginning of another, with the stadium set to house Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers, two clubs whose high-level executives barely speak with one another.</p>
      <p>And just recently Los Angeles Chargers owner Dean Spanos had to deny that he had no intention of moving the franchise to London.</p>
      <p>“We're not going to London," said Spanos. "We're not going anywhere. We're playing in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>"No consideration has been given to the Chargers playing anywhere other than Los Angeles at the new stadium in Hollywood Park next season and beyond.</p>
      <p>"There have been no discussions of any kind between the NFL and the Chargers regarding moving to London. Both our office and the Chargers are entirely focused on the success of the team in Los Angeles."</p>

      <p>The Chargers moved to Los Angeles for the 2017 season and play at Dignity Health Sports Park ahead of the move to the SoFi.</p>
      <p>Tension between Stan Kroenke and Chargers chief Spanos have been running high, with the two men "locked in a bitter fight" over a number of financial issues.</p>
      <p>Kroenke was left livid, according to a report from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28117460/inside-rams-chargers-marriage-nfl-fights-los-angeles">ESPN</a>, when his legacy project veered so badly off course, with no guarantee that SoFi will be filled once the novelty wears off.</p>

      <p>The Rams have joked to owners and confidants they'd happily accept extra financial donations from the league, but they haven't submitted a formal proposal and don't plan to.</p>
      <p>Kroenke is intent on delivering on his promise and not cutting corners, and is privately funding the SoFi Stadium with it carrying a $5 billion price tag - <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/how-much-money-stan-kroenke-17273593">he has invested a reported £1.23billion</a> of his own personal fortune into the stadium complex.</p>
      <p>But with neither side managing to attract more than 46,435 per game in 2019, Kroenke’s gamble could be one that comes back to bite him.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, with Arsenal struggling in the Premier League and reportedly not planning to spend in January, fans will surely be asking where their owner is getting $5 billion for the project from.</p>
