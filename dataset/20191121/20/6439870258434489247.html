      <p>NORTH CAROLINA (Mark Price/The Charlotte Observer) - The famed Cold Mountain featured in a popular novel and award-winning movie is on fire in Western North Carolina.</p>
      <p>A brief video shared by the U.S. Forest Service on Thursday showed orange flames visible at multiple spots along the mountain’s ridge. The fire was producing clouds of smoke that could be seen 10 miles away from the Blue Ridge Parkway.</p>
      <p>“Shining Rock Wilderness area including all trails temporarily closed due to a wildfire on Cold Mountain,”<a href="https://twitter.com/NFsNCarolina/status/1197539812707729408"> the U.S. Forest Service tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>“Please avoid the area to allow firefighters to focus on responding to the fire. And please, please, do not fly drones as there will be firefighting aircraft in the area.”</p>
      <p>The wildfire had <a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/crews-battle-brush-fire-in-haywood-county-20-30-acres-in-size-at-this-time">spread across as many as 30 acres</a> by midday Thursday, WLOS said.</p>
      <p>National Park Service officials <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlueRidgeNPS/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARDPtF31Xfwieh68ZTEWuNJuqaHFhI-LBjIuDSPTK_YPer7ZmRzAEU07hN6VxJ8GcY-9-TrmYE8BoJLH">posted an alert around noon</a> Thursday, noting the fire is not impacting the Blue Ridge Parkway, despite the presence of smoke in the area.</p>
      <p>U.S. Forest Service officials did not say what might have caused the fire or where it started at the site. A time-lapse camera<a href="https://webcam.srs.fs.fed.us/webcams/shining.php?fbclid=IwAR2XtFgGDewL8J6_S4XoxLybnx5FVeV3015Cs0GitfSQOWyIbE1LqAf6czk"> shows smoke began to appear </a>between 8 and 9 a.m. The mountain, which has an elevation of 6,030 feet, <a href="https://www.romanticasheville.com/coldmountain.htm">is about 35 miles from Asheville</a>, according to Romantic Asheville.</p>
      <p>Cold Mountain captured the imagination of people around the world when it was featured in Charles Frazier’s 1997 best-selling debut novel “Cold Mountain,” about “a wounded Confederate soldier’s harrowing journey through western North Carolina to reunite with his beloved,” <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article175130651.html">according to The News &amp; Observer</a>.</p>
      <p>“Millions more fans came to love these characters – Inman and Ada – in the 2003 award-winning film adaptation starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger,” the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>The movie wasn’t filmed in North Carolina, reports Romantic Asheville.</p>
      <p>Shining Rock Wilderness Area encompasses more than 18,000 acres in the Blue Ridge Mountains, <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recarea/?recid=48260">according to the Forest Service</a>. It’s about 150 miles west of Charlotte.</p>
      <p>Frazier began writing the novel while teaching at N. C. State University, The News &amp; Observer reported.</p>
