      <h1>Jurgen Klopp insists there is "absolutely no chance" of Liverpool sealing Kylian Mbappe transfer</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool have been linked with a a transfer swoop for PSG superstar Mbappe but Klopp has quashed the rumours once and for all</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">David Maddock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-maddock/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has dashed the hopes of millions of Liverpool fans… by insisting there is “absolutely no chance” of the club signing Kylian Mbappe.</p>
      <p>The Reds have long been linked with the French star, after first making an approach for him back in 2017 when he was at Monaco. And a recent link up with Nike as the Merseyside club’s kit sponsor has added fuel to the fire.</p>
      <p>Mbappe is one of Nike’s biggest stars, and there have been suggestions this week that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> president Florentino Perez is genuinely worried the English Champions League winners have the resources to outbid even his own club.</p>
      <p>Klopp though, was blunt in response. As he plots the downfall of super-rich <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> this weekend, he revealed the prospect of buying Mbappe is simply not part of the longer term strategy.</p>

      <p>"OK, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign Mbappe, what a player he is,” Klopp said.</p>
      <p>“But it is about the money of course. No chance. Absolutely no chance, sorry for killing that story.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there is a club in the world that can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG. And we are involved in that too. We cannot do it, it is as easy as that.</p>
      <p>"We have nothing (more) to say about it to be honest, but [buying] this calibre of player is difficult."</p>
      <p>Klopp though, believes it is possible for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> to rival City, even without the endless resources now required to sign the likes of Mbappe that only a super-rich club backed by oil money can provide.</p>
      <p>“This team is in a wonderful age and they really still have space for improvement,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Reds boss revealed that both Virgil van Dijk and Jordan Henderson are available for the showdown with City, but Joel Matip is ruled out until after the international break.</p>
