      <h2>Kerry Borlase, from Tintagel in Cornwall, risks losing her teeth and sight to undergo treatment but "would rather explain to my kids that I've gone blind in one eye than them having to bury their mum"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:44:28+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:44</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Smallcombe</a></address>
      <p>A mum will bravely undergo radiotherapy to treat her cancer even though she risks losing her upper teeth and sight in one eye.</p>
      <p>Kerry Borlase was diagnosed with stage 2/3 squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer, after months of doctors initially believing she just had a "blocked nose".</p>
      <p>She has already had a tumour in her nose removed and this week made the decision to have radiotherapy, reports <a href="https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/brave-cancer-sufferer-lose-sight-3517260">Cornwall Live.</a></p>
      <p>The treatment means she has to have all of the teeth in her upper gum removed and she is also likely to lose her sight in one eye.</p>
      <p>Kerry, of Tintagel, said: “I have a 20% chance of the cancer coming back and I’ll more than likely lose my right eyesight. I could have continued to have biopsies with a 50% chance of the cancer coming back.</p>
      <p>“I've also got to have all of my upper teeth out as radiotherapy will destroy bones in the upper gums.</p>
      <p>“I'd rather explain to my kids that I've gone blind in one eye than them having to bury their mum or nan.”</p>

      <p>Kerry is being cared for by her fiancé Rob, and they also have to care for three children, all of whom are living with a range of disabilities. Kerry also has an 11-month old granddaughter.</p>
      <p>She claims she was initially told by her GP that she “just has a blocked nose”, and is desperate to raise awareness of squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
      <p>“If ever you feel like an idiot going to your GP with a blocked nose, please don’t,” she said.</p>
      <p>“My GP should have got me an appointment on a two-week cancer pathway, but instead still six months later he convinced me I was being dramatic and that there was nothing wrong with my nose.”</p>
      <p>As part of her radiotherapy treatment, Kerry will have to make the 90-mile round trip to Plymouth’s Derriford Hospital five days a week for six weeks.</p>
      <p>Kerry's friends have set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising up to £5,000 to help cover her travel expenses and other bills.</p>
      <p>Writing on the Go Fund Me page, Michelle Storey said: “[They] are desperate for daily life essentials such as funding for hospital appointments, bills, heating oil, and as of next week they won’t be able to do hospital appointments as they have no MoT on the car and it needs extensive work.</p>
      <p>“Granted, as they are on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> some percentage of fuel is paid back, but not the full amount and taxi is impossible to fund.</p>
      <p>“Food funds are at a crisis point. The family were planning to go back to work but this is now impossible with Rob caring for Kerry, who's struggling to get out of bed being so ill and being the main carers for disabled children as they aren't entitled to any respite through council services.</p>
      <p>“Christmas approaches and they have absolutely nothing. No car, no chance of getting to appointments, no food, no heating and not enough money to pay for basic essentials, as what's left over is paying for child minders to make sure the children are safe at home.”</p>
