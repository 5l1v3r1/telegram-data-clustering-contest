      <p>MUMBAI: Two companies of the Ajay Piramal-led <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Piramal-Group">Piramal Group</a> — AASAN Corporate Solutions and Piramal Realty — were downgraded on Friday on the grounds that deterioration in the operating environment will make it difficult to raise funds. The borrowings by AASAN Corporate Solutions (ACSPL) are guaranteed by the Sri Krishna Trust (SKT) and PRL Realtors (PRL), which derive their strength from having around 44% shareholding in Piramal Enterprises (PEL).</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ICRA">ICRA</a> on Friday lowered the rating on AASAN’s Rs 1,900-crore non-convertible debentures to A-(CE) from A+(CE). Similarly, Piramal Realty’s Rs 350-crore debentures have been downgraded to A-(CE) from A+(CE). The CE in the rating refers to credit enhancement on account of a guarantee from SKT and PRL.</p>
      <p>SKT holds 39.6% shareholding in PEL where it is the single largest shareholder as on September 30. Furthermore, PRL also holds 4.5% equity stake in PEL as on September 30.</p>
      <p>According to ICRA, had it not been for the credit enhancement, the companies would have a BBB rating. “The family office entities in the Piramal Group have a combined liquidity of around Rs 400 crore as on June 30. The guarantors, SKT and PRL, do not have any external debt,” ICRA said.</p>
      <p>ICRA believes that SKT has flexibility to raise funds by liquidating its shareholding in PEL (if required). “As on March 31, ACSPL had a cash and bank balance of around Rs 173 crore. The liquidity available at both family office and ACPSL level is low as compared to the repayment obligations due in the short term,” ICRA said.</p>
      <p>ACSPL was set up on July 14, 2011. Since FY16, the company has engaged in investing/lending to group companies and other entities engaged in real estate and leasing, and trading in commodities such as gold and silver.</p>
      <p>Piramal Realty (PRPL) was set up in 2010 and had its presence in the real estate sector through subsidiaries/step-down subsidiaries/partnerships that have projects housed in it or through joint ventures. The company no longer has any real estate projects. The sole shareholder for PRPL is Sri GopiKrishna Trust, which is another trust company under the Piramal Group. In FY17, the company had started commodity (primarily gold and silver) trading business.</p>
