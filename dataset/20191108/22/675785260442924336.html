      <p>A baby is said to have been seriously hurt in an 'incident' in Balymoney this evening.</p>
      <p>A PSNI spokesperson said: "Police are currently investigating an incident in the Mosside area of Ballymoney.</p>
      <p>"There are no further details at this stage."</p>
      <p>DUP Causeway Councillor John McAuley said forensics are at the family's home and that a criminal investigation appears to have been launched.</p>
      <p>He added: "A baby has been seriously injured so obviously our thoughts are first and foremost with them and connected family members.</p>
      <p>"We hope the injured baby makes a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p>"I am not sure who is involved but if anybody has any information I would certainly ask them to pass it on to the police.</p>
      <p>"It is in the hands of detectives and it would appear to be a criminal investigation. Forensics are there. At this stage the PSNI are not willing to release any information."</p>
