      <p>The original story of "Lady and the Tramp" has endured for more than 60 years, ever since the 1955 animated film that made eating a plate of spaghetti an act of love.</p>
      <p>Now, a new live action version for the <a href="http://disneyplus.com/?cid=DTCI-Synergy-ABCOwnedTV-Site-Acquisition-USLaunch-US-DisneyPlus-LadyandtheTramp-EN-ArticleLink-ABCOTVWABCTrampPreview-NA">Disney+ streaming service</a> features the voices of Justin Theroux as The Tramp and Tessa Thompson as Lady. We met them in Lower Manhattan along with their canine co-stars.</p>
      <p>"This is Rosie, or Rose, and she plays Lady," Thompson said. "And she is <i>such</i> a lady. Look at her. She's been sitting all day through the press."</p>
      <p>The filmmakers worked with North Shore Animal League in Port Washington on Long Island to cast the movie with rescue dogs.</p>
      <p>"This is Monty, who plays 'The Tramp,' and he's been a tramp all day," Theroux said. "He's been just running off and getting off the couch, and he's not supposed to. He's not here for your rules. He's a rule breaker."</p>
      <p>Both stars have rescued dogs of their own, part of a philosophy to, "<i>paw</i> it forward," as Justin punned.</p>
      <p>"This guy was homeless," Theroux said of Monty. "Someone abandoned this dog somewhere down the line, and someone found him."</p>
      <p>But paw it forward or pay it forward, the result sure is entertaining.</p>
      <p>"And other dogs might get adopted, so that's a win-win," Theroux said.</p>
      <p>The only way to see the movie is to sign-up for Disney+, the new streaming service that debuts next week.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't particularly like, 'Oh, it's gotta be on a movie screen' or 'it's not a real movie,' or any of that kind of thing," Theroux said. "Sometimes, particularly in television, the quality can skyrocket when it's being delivered via streaming."</p>
      <p>Disney+ will be home to the best of the Studio, plus Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic.</p>
      <p>"Streaming is really a sort of new frontier, so it's exciting to be sort of an early settler in that sense," Thompson said.</p>
      <p>These two pioneers have plenty of company, as <a href="https://abc7ny.com/entertainment/no-one-will-ever-be-the-same-cast-talks-the-mandalorian-star-wars-series/5676867/">a new series called "The Mandalorian"</a> is set in the Star Wars Universe five years after events shown in "The Return of the Jedi."</p>
      <p>All of the "Star Wars" films will be available on the new service, along with everything from "Iron Man" to "Mary Poppins."</p>
