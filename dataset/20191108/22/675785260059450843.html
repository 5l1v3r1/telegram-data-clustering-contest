      <h1>Felipe Anderson on Neymar friendship, idolising Paolo Di Canio and his favourite London museums</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: West Ham star Anderson forged a strong friendship with big pal Neymar as youngsters - and looked up to Hammers legend Di Canio</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Felipe Anderson grew up with Neymar, wants to emulate Paolo di Canio and has found a perfect home at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>Anderson enjoys London, visits museums and his own difficult upbringing in Brazil makes him appreciate life as a Premier League star and West Ham’s work in the community.</p>
      <p>Brazilian winger Anderson, 26, moved 1,000 miles from his home in Santa Maria to begin his long footballing journey which eventually took him to Santos and he made his debut alongside Neymar.</p>
      <p>It is easy to forget that footballers do have it tough growing up to chase their dream and, for any kid in Brazil, that is to play professionally which has become a reality.</p>
      <p>“It was very tough for me. I was the youngest member of my family and I had always been protected but then I had the opportunity to move very far away at the age of 13,” said Anderson who is one of four siblings.</p>

      <p>“My family wasn’t in a position to help me, it was tough financially, it wasn’t easy to communicate so I really needed the friends I made to help me get through it. I could only see my family twice a year for three years. I had to be strong and stick it through with my dream.</p>
      <p>“It was very special to meet him (Neymar) in the early days, when I was playing under-15s, under-16s, we played together for three years. He turned professional, but we’d already formed a strong friendship and he quickly became a star.</p>
      <p>“He made sure he helped me, gave me advice and confidence and really helped me with that. He told me to be as confident as I could, listen out to advice from all areas, learn as much as possible because it was such a big opportunity to turn professional at such a young age.”</p>
      <p>Anderson was just 20 when he moved to Europe with Lazio where he spent five years but when West Ham came in for him there was no hesitation and he was immediately aware of the di Canio links as the Hammers legend played for the Serie A club.</p>
      <p>“Paolo di Canio is the obvious one as he also played for Lazio, he is still an idol here at West Ham, I knew about his story at the club,” said Anderson.</p>

      <p>“The goals, the fantastic performances he produced and how much the fans love him so I’m trying to work as hard as I can to follow in his footsteps.</p>
      <p>“It was a dream for me to join this league, I got plenty of support from West Ham as a club, I enjoyed a few good performances last season but what matters is the overall team displays and that’s still an area where there’s work to be done.</p>
      <p>“The club has shown a great love and support for me from when I arrived, even when things have not gone well, so I’ve always been sure to work as hard as possible and to repay the club with goals and performances to get the team as high up the table as possible.”</p>
      <p>Anderson arrived with a huge £40m price tag, enjoyed a memorable first season in London - scoring ten goals - but he is all too aware that expectations were even higher this season.</p>
      <p>This is a player who does care, he wants to deliver for the supporters who have backed him but feels an affinity for a club which is trying to give something back to the community with the Players’ Project which celebrated its one year anniversary.</p>

      <p>Anderson does not want to be the cliched foreign player just passing through, his upbringing perhaps has given him a different view of life and wants to make the most of it.</p>
      <p>“It’s like a big family here and it’s important to look back on my childhood, growing up and I’m in a position to be able to help people in a like this so it’s something that makes me very happy,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s certainly been very important to have my own family with me. They came with me to Italy, left what they had in Brazil and also adapted to a new country, new culture and new language was difficult but having their support in the good and bad times was fantastic.</p>
      <p>“I do try to get to a new part of London every week, visit a museum once or twice a week if possible. My favourite museum is the British Museum.</p>
      <p>“I love the city here, it has so many great attractions and I enjoy living here, learning from different cultures. Of course it’s a bit on the cold side - but I’m getting used to it!”</p>
      <p>
        <i>The Players’ Project has 11 different strands and delivers over 30 programmes which include health, education, community initiatives and football development, which engage with up to 50,000 people per year.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>West Ham are particularly proud that the players have embraced the scheme with the club committed to investing £28m by the end of 2021 for different community projects.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>One of the beneficiaries is West Ham fan Neal Crowley, 37, from Dagenham, who attends a community centre every week and is close friends with the club’s Community Support Manager Austin Hughes.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Wheelchair-bound Crowley said: “We all know how difficult it is out there, but that doesn’t stop them and I feel privileged to support their work.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>West Ham star Felipe Anderson added: “I’m certainly happy to play for a club where there’s such a big project in place and I had dreamt of doing myself in the local area where I grew up and now I’m very proud to be part of a club where there is such a big project in place.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s also very important to commemorate the success the success the project has had so far and it’s something the players are very happy and proud of.”</i>
