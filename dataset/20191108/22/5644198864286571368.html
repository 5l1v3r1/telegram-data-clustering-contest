      <p>LONDON: British police released the names of the 39 Vietnamese victims, including three boys, found dead in the back of a truck near London last month and said consultations had begun with Hanoi over <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/vietnam-repatriate-39-bodies-found-dead-in-uk-truck-12073482">repatriation of the bodies</a>.</p>
      <p>The 31 males and eight women were found in a truck container on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, not far from docks on the River Thames, in the early hours of Oct 23.</p>

      <p>Two were aged just 15 and another was 17, while the oldest was 44.</p>

      <p>"This was an incredibly important process and our team has been working hard to bring answers to worried families who fear their loved one may be among those whose tragic journey ended on our shores," said Tim Smith, the Assistant Chief Constable of Essex Police.</p>
      <p>"It remained of paramount importance to us to ensure that an individual’s next of kin were informed and that they were given some time to absorb this tragic news before we publicly confirmed their loved one’s identity."</p>
      <p>Police said the Vietnamese and British governments were working on how to achieve repatriation of the bodies. The exact cause of the deaths has not yet been disclosed.</p>
      <p>The victims were found not long after the container arrived in Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium. The refrigerated unit was picked up at Purfleet dock, east of London, while police believe the truck cab was driven over from Ireland.</p>

      <p>The truck driver, from Northern Ireland, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, and money laundering. A second man has been charged with the same offences and British authorities are now in the process of trying to extradite him from Dublin.</p>
