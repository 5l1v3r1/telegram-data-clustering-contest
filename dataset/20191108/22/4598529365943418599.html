      <p>Two buddies of Rudy Giuliani’s tried to arrange a deal with Ukraine’s last President whereby he would get a state visit to the U.S. during an election campaign, so long as Kyiv agreed to announce investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 elections, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/giuliani-associates-urged-ukraines-prior-president-to-open-biden-election-probes-11573247707?mod=breakingnews">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman reportedly met with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Kyiv in late February to negotiate the deal. Poroshenko was beaten in an April presidential runoff election by the country’s current leader Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>The meeting reportedly took place in the offices of then-General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko. Fruman and Parnas had traveled to Warsaw earlier in the month with Giuliani, where they met with the country’s top prosecutor.</p>
      <p>Lutsenko went on to be the main source for a series of articles by John Solomon that laid the foundation for a host of baseless claims that Giuliani and President Trump have demanded Kyiv to investigate.</p>
      <p>State Department official George Kent told House investigators that he believed at least some of Lutsenko’s activities had been “authorized” by Poroshenko, according to a transcript released Thursday.</p>
