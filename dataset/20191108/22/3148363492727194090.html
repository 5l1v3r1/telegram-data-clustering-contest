      <h1>'Atypical' Actor Michael Rapaport Calls Trump a 'Desperate D*ck Stain' for MAGA Challenge</h1>
      <h2>The star of the Netflix series Atypical, Michael Rapaport is once again indulging his near daily attack on President Donald Trump, this time calling the president a “dick stain” for his MAGA challenge.</h2>

      <p>Michael Rapaport was seen replying to the president’s tweet Friday, in which Trump announced his plans to award the winners of the #MAGAChallenge — which sees fans who post to social media cute videos showing their support for the president.</p>
      <p>But the distempered Rapaport wasn’t having it, tweeting: “Desperate Dick Stain thinks he’s running for Class President. Desperate Pig. With your Desperate Child.”</p>

      <p>Apparently, Rapaport has <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/07/04/michael-rapaport-attacks-dck-stain-president-trump-and-fcking-chicken-head-ivanka/">called</a> Trump a “dick stain” before and seems to simply recycle the attack over and over again.</p>
      <p>Of course, the foul-mouthed Fox Sports personality does not merely target the president with his always vulgar tweets. Recently Rapaport <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/10/15/actor-michael-rapaport-i-told-yall-lebron-james-was-the-fakest-guy-in-the-nba/">went after</a> NBA star LeBron James, calling James a “fake” progressive after the L.A. Laker came out in dogged support of the oppressive Chinese government instead of the pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>After James’ comments on China — one of the biggest human rights abusers in the world — Rapaport slammed him saying, “When I told y’all LeBron James was the FAKEST guy in the NBA, y’all called me a hater. Apologize to me now!”</p>

      <p>The actor-director was also triggered by the Covington Catholic kids, too.</p>
      <p>In January, Rapaport <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/01/23/michael-rapaport-melts-down-on-covington-students-catholic-school-cucks-ccksuckers/">regurgitated</a> the lie that a group of school kids from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky “harassed” a group of Native Americans in Washington, D.C., earlier this year. Along with repeating the lie that the kids “harassed” the Native Americans, Rapaport called them “fuckboys” and “handjobs.”</p>
