      <h1>Brendan Rodgers warns Leicester are trying to 'lob a hand-grenade' into established elite again</h1>
      <h2>Leicester boss Rodgers has the Foxes in third in the Premier League ahead of hosting Arsenal at the King Power Stadium on Saturday evening</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers admits Leicester are relishing trying to lob a “hand-grenade” into the established elite again.</p>
      <p>The underdog Foxes won the title in 2016 before the big powers spent huge sums to redress the balance of power.</p>
      <p>But now City are up to third under Rodgers and are pushing for honours and European qualification again.</p>
      <p>They have capitalised on indifferent form by the likes of Spurs, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , who visit tonight.</p>
      <p>Boss Rodgers said: “You have to fight.</p>
      <p>“You can’t accept that is the top six in terms of money and finance and that you are always going to sit below it.</p>

      <p>“We have to hopefully find a way and drop a hand-grenade in there. But we have to do it in a different way.</p>
      <p>“We have resources but not the resources to get some of these players who will go to other clubs.</p>
      <p>“We have to find a way but that is the exciting part and beauty, and the challenge.”</p>
      <p>Yet Rodgers knows if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> are successful it could inspire the bigger clubs to hit back with vast investment in new players.</p>
      <p>He added: “It has sometimes been a trend that if something happens that wakens them up they have that facility to go and spend and get the level of player to get them back up there.”</p>
