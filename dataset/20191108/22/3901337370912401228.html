        <b>Absa Premiership</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Maritzburg United 2-2 Bloemfontein Celtic</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 08 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Harry Gwala Stadium</p>
      <p>Maritzburg United came back from two goals down to force a 2-2 draw against Bloemfontein Celtic at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>Maritzburg coach Eric Tinkler rang the changes to the side that held Orlando Pirates to a goalless draw, with Pogiso Sanoka taking the place of the suspended Kwanda Mngonyama, while the likes of Keagan Buchanan and Gabriel Nyoni were given a run in the line-up. Meanwhile, Siwelele made four changes to the side that beat Highlands Park on Tuesday, with left-back Ronald Pfumbidzai and striker Ndumiso Mabena returning to boost the team.</p>
      <p>United were on the front foot in the early stages as they came close to opening the scoring in the ninth minute after Thabiso Kutumela hit the upright with a strike inside the box .</p>
      <p>Maritzburg came close to breaking the deadlock again on the half-hour mark after Jeremy Brockie got on the end of Buchanan's corner at the near post but his effort sailed narrowly wide.</p>
      <p>The home side still had the momentum in the closing phase of the first stanza, while Celtic were absorbing the pressure and waiting for chances on counter-attacks, but nothing materialised in the opening 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>Leehlohonolo Seema's charges eventually found the breakthrough five minutes into the second stanza as Sera Motebang broke the deadlock after being setup by Menzi Masuku.</p>
      <p>United were on the back foot with 15 minutes remaining after defender Siyanda Xulu was not able to continue with the match due to injury and they had to soldier on playing with ten men after Tinkler had already used all his substitutions.</p>
      <p>Phunya Sele Sele doubled their lead with eight minutes remaining after Siphelele Luthuli tapped home a square pass from Masuku as the visitors looked to seal a second successive win.</p>
      <p>However, Maritzburg pulled a goal back in the last three minutes through Daylon Claasen from the penalty spot, after the former Bidvest Wits midfielder was brought down in the ox.</p>
      <p>The Team of Choice found the equaliser in the last minute thanks to Judas Moseamedi who fired a strike to the top corner after making his way inside the box to seal a point for the home side.</p>
