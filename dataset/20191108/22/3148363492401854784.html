      <h1>Struggling Kamala Posts Video of Self Grimacing at Clips of Trump</h1>
      <h2>Sen. Kamala Harris on Thursday posted a video of herself reacting to cherry-picked clips of President Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1192275982599753729">compiled</a> by her team.</h2>

      <p>Harris, who continues to flounder in national and early-state polls, is upping her game on social media, posting videos interacting with supporters and taking a new approach: Reacting to cherry-picked clips of the president on camera.</p>
      <p>A video posted on her Twitter account on Thursday shows the presidential hopeful grimacing while watching selective clips of the president.</p>
      <p>“Anybody could have listened to that meeting. That meeting is open for grabs. You know, the whole Russia thing, it’s a hoax,” Trump said in the video.</p>
      <p>“Open for grabs?” Harris asked, providing commentary. “You know what he has made open for grabs? The United States of America, and he’s selling us out.”</p>
      <p>“He’s selling out our system of justice, not mention that he has sold out working people and sold out our values,” she continued, failing to elaborate on the sweeping claims.</p>
      <p>“It’s really, it’s fascinating. If it weren’t so troubling, it would be really incredibly fascinating. These are these moments where I really wish that I had taken more psychology classes,” she added.</p>
      <p>“There was no collusion with Russia,” Trump said in another clip, prompting Harris to laugh uncontrollably.</p>
      <p>“Literally Donald Trump plays Alec Baldwin so well. It’s just amazing to watch,” she laughed.</p>
      <p>“He’s such a good actor,” she added, arms flailing:</p>

      <p>This is far from Harris’s first attempt to appeal to voters in an unconventional way. Harris posted a six-minute video this week, featuring a baking session with a 17-year-old supporter in Iowa.</p>
      <p>“Oh, look at how that just bends, right?” Harris <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/05/desperate-kamala-harris-posts-6-minute-video-baking-cookies/">said</a> in the video, marveling at the baked cookie.</p>
      <p>“It’s just a peanut butter, oatmeal, chocolate chip cookie in one,” she added. “I now realize what this is”:</p>
