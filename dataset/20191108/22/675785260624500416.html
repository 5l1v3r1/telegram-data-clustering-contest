      <p>British EuroMillions winner Matt Myles who used his winnings to jet across the globe living a playboy lifestyle has announced his fiancee is pregnant with their second child.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/playboy-euromillions-winner-who-bedded-11768252">Matt Myles</a> , who claimed to have bedded scores of women on a £500,000 round-the-world lads' trip after bagging £1million, has now said he has "couldn't be happier" after settling down.</p>
      <p>He was 27 and an electrical engineer at a food company when he won the money in 2014. But at age 31 in 2017 he told the Mirror he feared ending up like other troubled lottery winners after embarking on a post-lottery blow-out with his brother and mates.</p>
      <p>But now, at age 33, as he looks forward to welcoming a sibling to his first child, his son Jude, with Stacy Edwards. He told the BBC he's become "a little bit of a level-headed adult that’s started a couple of businesses".</p>

      <p>Matt said: "I’m now engaged. I’ve got a little boy, almost two, and one on the way, so he’s starting nursery.</p>
      <p>"We’re planning a wedding which is fantastic so I couldn’t be happier at the moment.</p>
      <p>"I became a little bit of a level-headed adult that’s started a couple of businesses."</p>
      <p>In 2017 Matt told the Mirror how he was determined to turn his life around after spending and living to excess from his life-changing £1 million win in April 2014.</p>
      <p>Celebrating his newfound outlook on life in 2017, Matt embarked on another round-the-world trip on April 8, the third anniversary of his jackpot, to mark his new life with Stacy.</p>
      <p>The whirlwind 12 months came after Matt, from Hereford <i>,</i> had told in 2016 how he spent £500,000 over 18 months in 22 countries, glugging champagne, buying designer clothes and bedding at least 150 women.</p>

      <p>And now he's welcoming his second child, he can look back fondly on his wild days.</p>
      <p>This week he told the BBC: "In the first 12 months I did go wild and I do not regret any part of it at all.</p>
      <p>"I think in the 12 months, we got through the whole of the east coast of America and pretty much all of south east Asia and then Ibiza.</p>
      <p>"To live the single lad’s dream, if you like, kind of captured the imagination of a lot of people which I honestly did really enjoy.</p>

      <p>"Walking up to the front of the queue and getting tables for seven or eight thousand pound didn’t really bother me.</p>
      <p>"I took 13 of my closest friends to Ibiza.</p>
      <p>"The stand out moment of that holiday I’d say was hiring a private yacht that went to the back of Café Mambo with Fat Boy Slim DJ’ing in the background – that was pretty cool."</p>

      <p>In 2017 Matt said he and Stacy began their round-the-world trip for a week only months after meeting through mutual friends.</p>
      <p>After several relationships in the aftermath of his win, Matt met Stacy, an NHS play specialist helping children from Ludlow, Shropshire, in August 2016.</p>
      <p>He saw her every day for a week before going on an USA trip with friends for a month but was Facetiming her every day from the holiday.</p>

      <p>"We were inseparable from the outset," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was good to go around with the boys to experience the world as a single lad but this time with the trip with Stacy I got to see things and travel with someone I cared about," he explained.</p>
      <p>"It made the moments more special - rather being hungover."</p>

      <p>The loved up couple's trip was disrupted only weeks in when Stacy fell ill in Asia - only to discover it was morning sickness and she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>The discovery sent the couple on a rollercoaster year - later learning the baby was diagnosed with a rare form of Spina bifida that could have lead to health problems at birth.</p>
      <p>And Matt said he has made all his money back - and then some - with two businesses, a property company and a car firm.</p>
      <p>He claimed in 2017 he was worth as much as £1.4 million after his mother read him the riot act.</p>
