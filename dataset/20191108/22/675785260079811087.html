      <h2>Jeremy Corbyn will say the Tories are "failing a whole generation of children" as he vows to reverse years of cuts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Labour would open 1,000 Sure Start centres to boost young families, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> has announced.</p>
      <p>Some 1,000 of the vital community centres were shut under Tory cuts, despite young parents hailing them as a lifeline as they raised their children.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> would also boost free childcare to 30 hours a week for all children aged 2 to 4 - far more than the Tories offer. The Tories only offer it for working parents of those aged 3 or 4, and some others.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn, who will unveil the pledges in Leeds, said: “The Conservatives are failing a whole generation of children.</p>
      <p>“Labour will deliver the real change Britain needs.</p>
      <p>“Parents are struggling to afford the childcare support they need, while many children are going hungry and growing up homeless.</p>
      <p>“Labour will open a Sure Start centre in every community and fund 30 hours’ free childcare for all two to four-year-olds to unlock the potential of every child.”</p>
      <p>Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner, who had her first baby as a teenager, said at a rally: “When I was 16 and I had my son I went to a Sure Start centre, one of the first under the last Labour government, and I can honestly say that Sure Start centre made me a better mum.</p>

      <p>“It taught me how important it was to sit with my child and give them cuddles and to read to them.</p>
      <p>“You gave me a gift to be a better mum than my mum had the ability to be - and you changed the life of my children.</p>
      <p>“That’s what Labour does when we’re in government.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I was that kid who grew up in a council house.</p>
      <p>“My mum was from Wythenshawe and couldn’t read or write.</p>
      <p>“I left school without qualifications, pregnant at 16. I felt ashamed of who I was.</p>

      <p>“I felt I was nothing, and I remember at the time there was a Tory minister at the time saying girls like me were getting pregnant to get council housing.</p>
      <p>“That’s what they think.”</p>
      <p>In June, a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found Sure Start centres brought “big benefits for children’s health”.</p>
      <p>Aimed at improving early years health and education, they were launched 20 years ago as a flagship of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> ’s Labour Party.</p>
      <p>The study found that for every one Sure Start centre per thousand children there were 5,500 fewer hospital admissions for 11-year-olds each year.</p>
