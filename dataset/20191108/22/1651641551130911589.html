        <b>Death Stranding releases on PlayStation 4 today and to celebrate, pre-orders for the PC version of the game are now live on both Steam and the Epic Games Store.</b>
      </p>
      <p>For those worrying about Epic exclusivity or having to wait longer for the game to release on Steam, you can put your worries to rest. In a blog post, <a href="https://505games.com/hideo-kojimas-death-stranding-available-to-pre-order-on-pc-now/">505 Games has confirmed</a> that the game will launch simultaneously on both Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
      <p>The game is priced at $59.99/£54.99/€59.99 and set to release on PC in Summer 2020. You can pre-order it now on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190460/Death_Stranding/">by following the link here</a> and on the Epic Games Store <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/death-stranding/home">by following the link here</a>.</p>
      <p>For those out of the loop on what Death Stranding is: don’t worry! We don’t think anybody aside from Kojima himself knows what it <i>really</i> is.</p>
      <p>However, we can confirm that the game contains things such as <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/death-stranding-will-let-you-pee-on-everything-including-ghost-babies-and-geoff-keighley/">ghost babies, a dedicated pee mechanic, Geoff Keighley,</a> cross-dimensional breast feeding, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/spend-enough-on-death-stranding-and-get-a-life-sized-baby-lamp/">real life baby lamps that can also be used as paperweights or hefty projectiles</a>, an apparent endorsement courtesy of Monster Energy, and much more. That’s a good enough explanation, right?</p>

      <p>The game features an all-star cast including Norman Reedus, Margaret Qualley, Mads Mikkelsen, Léa Seydoux, Lindsay Wagner, Nicolas Winding Refn, Troy Baker, Guillermo del Toro, Tommie Earl Jenkins, and Emily O’Brien, amongst many many many many others. Seriously. Even the silver-tongued Max Mittelman is in it, although we have yet to find him in-game.</p>
      <p>In all seriousness, though, you do actually spend the game delivering parcels. It’s the things that happen around you that really influence how the game plays out. There are also plenty of extremely long cutscenes, as per Kojima-tradition.</p>
      <p>We won’t be posting any story-based spoilers, as that would ruin it for those who are waiting for Death Stranding on PC. Nonetheless, if you own a PlayStation 4, consider <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA11260_00-DEATHSTRAND00001">picking it up for yourself on the PlayStation Store here</a>. Happy gaming!</p>
