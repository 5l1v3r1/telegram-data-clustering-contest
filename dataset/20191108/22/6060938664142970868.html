      <p>MUMBAI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sebi">Sebi</a> chief <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajay-Tyagi">Ajay Tyagi</a> on Friday expressed concerns over the sluggish pace of fund-raising through the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ipo">IPO</a> market. He said despite the regulator’s permissions for offers aggregating about Rs 25,000 crore, not many <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/IPOs">IPOs</a> are being launched.</p>
      <p>Tyagi also pointed out that the level of fund-raising for greenfield infrastructure projects was very low and this has to go up for India to achieve a $5-trillion economy by 2024.</p>
      <p>The Sebi chief feels that fund-raising through the IPO route has to be kick-started with some confidence-building measures and the divestment of public sector units (PSUs) would be a boost for the market. “The planned divestments...is needed in the market,” Tyagi said at a conference organised by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/CII">CII</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking on infrastructure financing, Tyagi said there were serious issues in funding greenfield projects, both in terms of equity and debt, and steps are needed to improve the demand side. The question is of having the right models of public-private partnerships to see that private investments come, which in the last few years has been largely dominated by government spending, he said.</p>
      <p>The government plans to spend Rs 100 lakh crore in the infrastructure sector in the next five years. For this, Tyagi said credit enhance fund, which was announced in the Budget, needs to be operationalised quickly.</p>
