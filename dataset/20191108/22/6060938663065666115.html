      <p>MUMBAI: Markets regulator <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sebi">Sebi</a> on Friday took another step towards cutting down on the time taken for listing of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/IPOs">IPOs</a> from six working days after the close of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/book-building-process">book-building process</a> (T+6) to three days (T+3). The regulator has modified the process through which retail investors can apply for IPOs using the UPI mechanism in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Application-Supported-by-Blocked-Amount">Application Supported by Blocked Amount</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ASBA">ASBA</a>) in banks.</p>
      <p>This was done after Sebi received suggestions from the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/National-Payments-Corporation-of-India">National Payments Corporation of India</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/NPCI">NPCI</a>), the government-owned company that facilitates all electronic payments in India.</p>
      <p>On January 1, Sebi had mandated market participants to move to payments in IPOs through the UPI mechanism. The second phase of the system was launched on July 1.</p>
      <p>Since the unveiling of phase II of the process, Sebi said NPCI had “assessed the situation with respect to infrastructure at banks and their logistics and suggested further tweaking of systems, procedures and timelines for various activities for smoother operations of ASBA with UPI as a payment mechanism. Similar contraction of timelines is required to be carried out by the intermediaries in the securities market”.</p>
      <p>“In order to ensure that the transition to UPI in ASBA is smooth for all the stakeholders, it has been decided, after consultation with various intermediaries and NPCI, to extend the timeline for implementation of phase II” of the process till March 31, 2020, Sebi said. It also said that the process to shift to a T+3 mechanism will be notified separately.</p>
