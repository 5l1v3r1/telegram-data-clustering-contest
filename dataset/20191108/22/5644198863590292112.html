      <p>LONDON: Manchester City suffered a huge blow ahead of Sunday's (Nov 10) top-of-the-table clash at Premier League leaders Liverpool with goalkeeper Ederson ruled out through injury.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian international came off at half-time during Wednesday's 1-1 Champions League draw at Atalanta with a muscular problem.</p>

      <p>"He's not able to play," said City manager Pep Guardiola at his pre-match press conference.</p>
      <p>City ended that game in Milan with right-back Kyle Walker in goal after Ederson's replacement Claudio Bravo was sent off 10 minutes from time for bringing down Josip Ilicic outside his box.</p>
      <p>Bravo endured an error-strewn first season in England back in 2016/17 when City finished third in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Chilean has been replaced by Ederson as Guardiola's first-choice stopper over the past two seasons as City have won the league.</p>
      <p>However, Guardiola rejected suggestions that Bravo will be a liability at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"We have another top 'keeper," added Guardiola.</p>
      <p>"We won the Carabao (League) Cup and FA Cup thanks to Claudio. He's an exceptional 'keeper. He won a lot of games with his national team Chile too, so (I have) no doubts."</p>
