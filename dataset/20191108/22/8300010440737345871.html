      <p>The original story of "Lady and the Tramp" has endured for more than 60 years, ever since the 1955 animated film that made eating a plate of spaghetti an act of love.<br/><br/>Now, a new live action version for the <a href="http://disneyplus.com/?cid=DTCI-Synergy-ABCOwnedTV-Site-Acquisition-USLaunch-US-DisneyPlus-LadyandtheTramp-EN-ArticleLink-ABCOTVWABCTrampPreview-NA">Disney+ streaming service</a> features the voices of Justin Theroux as The Tramp and Tessa Thompson as Lady. We met them in Lower Manhattan along with their canine co-stars.<br/><br/>"This is Rosie, or Rose, and she plays Lady," Thompson said. "And she is <i>such</i> a lady. Look at her. She's been sitting all day through the press."<br/><br/>The filmmakers worked with North Shore Animal League in Port Washington on Long Island to cast the movie with rescue dogs.<br/><br/>"This is Monty, who plays 'The Tramp,' and he's been a tramp all day," Theroux said. "He's been just running off and getting off the couch, and he's not supposed to. He's not here for your rules. He's a rule breaker."<br/><br/>Both stars have rescued dogs of their own, part of a philosophy to, "<i>paw</i> it forward," as Justin punned.<br/><br/>"This guy was homeless," Theroux said of Monty. "Someone abandoned this dog somewhere down the line, and someone found him."<br/><br/>But paw it forward or pay it forward, the result sure is entertaining.<br/><br/>"And other dogs might get adopted, so that's a win-win," Theroux said.<br/><br/>The only way to see the movie is to sign-up for Disney+, the new streaming service that debuts next week.<br/><br/>"I wasn't particularly like, 'Oh, it's gotta be on a movie screen' or 'it's not a real movie,' or any of that kind of thing," Theroux said. "Sometimes, particularly in television, the quality can skyrocket when it's being delivered via streaming."<br/><br/>Disney+ will be home to the best of the Studio, plus Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic.<br/><br/>"Streaming is really a sort of new frontier, so it's exciting to be sort of an early settler in that sense," Thompson said.<br/><br/>These two pioneers have plenty of company, as <a href="https://abc7ny.com/entertainment/no-one-will-ever-be-the-same-cast-talks-the-mandalorian-star-wars-series/5676867/">a new series called "The Mandalorian"</a> is set in the Star Wars Universe five years after events shown in "The Return of the Jedi."<br/><br/>All of the "Star Wars" films will be available on the new service, along with everything from "Iron Man" to "Mary Poppins."<br/><br/><b><a href="http://disneyplus.com/?cid=DTCI-Synergy-ABCOwnedTV-Site-Acquisition-USLaunch-US-DisneyPlus-LadyandtheTramp-EN-ArticleLink-ABCOTVWABCTrampPreview-NA">Click here to learn more about Disney+.</a></b><br/><br/><i>The Walt Disney Company is the parent company of this station.</i></p>
