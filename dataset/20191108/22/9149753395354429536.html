      <h1>You can now change your Steam Library view back to small mode</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:27:43+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/ian-boudreau/" target="_blank">Ian Boudreau</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-big-steam-library-update-is-now-available-to-everyone/">new Steam Library</a> has been out for a couple months now, and while it adds some very nice new features, not everyone is happy with its presentation. Small mode was something Chris Livingston said he missed back when we asked how everyone was getting on <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/what-do-you-think-of-the-new-steam-library/">with the new format</a>, and he'll be pleased to learn that it's back, at least in Steam's beta branch.</p>
      <p>If you haven't opted into that, you can do so by opening Settings, and clicking the "Change…" dialog button in the Account section next to Beta Participation. From there, choose Steam Beta Update in the dropdown menu. </p>
      <p>Once you've opted in and updated your client, hit the "View" dropdown and assuming all is in place, you'll be able to select the "Small Mode" option, which will turn Steam into a wee little box at the bottom of your screen. If you don't like it, go back to the same dropdown and you'll notice a "Large Mode" option that will take you back to way things were. </p>
      <p>The update makes a number of other fixes and changes that you can read all about in the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/1600394952171527192">patch notes</a>.</p>
