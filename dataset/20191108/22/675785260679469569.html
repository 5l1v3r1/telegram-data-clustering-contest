      <h1>KSI and Logan Paul make retirement vows at weigh-in ahead of rematch</h1>
      <h2>There is no love lost between the Youtube stars, who traded their final barbs at the weigh-in ahead of their highly-anticipated rematch in Los Angeles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:52:30+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:52</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ksi">KSI</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/logan-paul">Logan Paul</a> both vowed to send the other into boxing and social media retirement as they came face to face for the final time before they touch gloves.</p>
      <p>The YouTube stars have turned professional for their rematch on Saturday night and both scaled inside the 200lb cruiserweight limit; Paul at 199.4lb and KSI six pounds lighter at 193.lb.</p>
      <p>And as the sun blazed in downtown Los Angeles, the pair repeated the insults they've traded all week.</p>
      <p>“He’s been saying the same thing every time, that he’s going to end me," said Paul. “I told him [promoter] <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/eddie-hearn">Eddie Hearn</a> is going to be in trouble because he’s going to get hurt.</p>
      <p>“I perform the best at my natural weight, watch me hit this man repeatedly on his giant forehead.”</p>

      <p>KSI and Paul fought to a draw in a white-collar bout in Manchester last year with both claiming the other missed his best chance to have his hand raised.</p>
      <p>And after weighing in, KSI - real name Olajide William Olatunji - said: "He should have beat me in his last fight; that was his best opportunity, now I’m too good for him.</p>
      <p>“Look at the team, I’m stacked, he has Shannon Briggs who is a hype man. It is over for him.</p>
      <p>“Once I get rid of the jab it’s over for him; he knows he’s finished, he knows nothing about boxing.”</p>

      <p>On the undercard, Billy Joe Saunders also made weight for the first defence of his super-middleweight world title.</p>
      <p>The traveller takes on the unbeaten but unknown Macelo Coceres, and he said. “The fans and Americans have been very loving so tune in to watch the knockout on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“You can see silky skills and the best coming from the UK.”</p>

      <p>Fellow world champion Devin Haney will put his lightweight belt on the line against Alfredo Alvarez having been upgraded to full champion status when Vasyl Lomachenko was awarded the 'legacy title'.</p>
      <p>And he said: I’m feeling great, I had a great training camp and I’m looking forward to putting on a show.</p>
      <p>“He won’t go 12 rounds; I’m one of the biggest names in boxing, I’m the youngest world champion in boxing and I’m going to show how good I am.”</p>
