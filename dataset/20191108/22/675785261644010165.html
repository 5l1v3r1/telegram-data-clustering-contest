      <h1>Nathan Ake on Eddie Howe's mentality that has established Bournemouth as Premier League force</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Nathan Ake has revealed the “never waste a day” catchphrase behind Eddie Howe’s success at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> .</p>
      <p>Ake, 24, has given a rare insight into Howe’s training ground methods and how Bournemouth has helped him develop into one of the most reliable defenders in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth boss Howe went viral last summer when the club put up a video of a pre-season training session in July to show exactly how intense and tough his sessions are.</p>
      <p>Not only did fans enjoying watching but Ake says he sent it to his family so they could see what he does every day because Howe never lets them waste a single session.</p>
      <p>Dutch international Ake, talking at the London launch of Need For Speed Heat, said: “He’s like this every day! I saw the clip and my family saw it, they really liked it because you never see the inside and what it’s like and how it goes. A lot of people liked it.</p>

      <p>“He’s like this every day, so intense. He’s so involved when he gets on the pitch. He never wastes a day and he says that to us as well. ‘Never waste a day on the training pitch. Don’t waste it, don’t just come in, work hard if you want to become better as a player.’</p>
      <p>“That’s how he is. He wants to make us better. That’s how it came out in the clip as well and you could see what he’s like as a manager.</p>
      <p>“I have improved so much, learned so much and a lot of that is down to him. Trying to make me a better player. I’m playing good, there’s still some things to improve, making sure I still make progress and he’s always on my case which is always very good.</p>
      <p>“Even if you have a few good games, stuff like that, he makes sure that we watch clips together and look for little, little things - even if I’d had a good game - he will find something to help me get better.</p>
      <p>“That’s perfect for me because, at my age, there’s still so much more to come and he’s the right man to help me improve.</p>

      <p>“I think it all comes from the manager, he’s always pushing us to become better, to grow as a club, to grow as a team. He’s one of the main drivers, he’s driving everything. That helps the club to grow.”</p>
      <p>No-one should underestimate Howe’s achievement at Bournemouth because to take a club of that size into the Premier League, keep them there and then attract the best young players is testament to the manager’s quality.</p>
      <p>There will always be ups and downs and, by Ake’s own admission, this season has been “shaky” in parts after a difficult start but they ended four games without a win by beating <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Now the key will be to take those sort of scalps at home on the road as they face a trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“I think the squad we have, we expect a lot from each other. It’s been a little bit up and down, I think the last result (Manchester United) helped a lot, it gave us confidence, a third clean sheet in a row was important,” said Ake.</p>
      <p>“Rebuilding confidence, I feel like we’re getting better each week and we’re making progress. It’s hard to say what are targets are. We started a bit shaky, a few wins, a few losses and a little bit inconsistent.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bit like last season. This team has great potential but that inconsistency, I think this year the main aim is to be more consistent. So if you have a win like this against Man United then you have to keep it going and not lose the next game. That’s one of the main aims.”</p>
      <p>The other big target for Ake is next summer’s Euros with Holland hosting games in the tournament, the Dutch are one of the favourites and learning from international team mates Virgil van Dijk and Matthijs de Ligt has also pushed him.</p>
      <p>He added: “The buzz and the vibe at the moment is so good. The manager (Ronald Koeman) is doing really well, the team we have now is a very talented squad so to be a part of that is very good.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got some games in Holland, here as well, all very close and it will be an amazing experience if we make it and I’m able to be part of the squad.</p>
      <p>“I don’t start for my country now, but when you train with the likes of van Dijk, De Ligt, then it helps your level go up.”</p>
