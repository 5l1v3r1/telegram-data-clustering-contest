      <p>Darren Till might be the only UFC middleweight willing to admit that the prospect of a fight with Yoel Romero is genuinely terrifying.</p>
      <p>Fresh off his split decision win over Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 244, Till called out ‘Soldier of God’ on Instagram.</p>

      <p>“Let’s go <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yoelromeromma/">@yoelromeromma</a>,” Till posted on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The next day, however, Till was honest enough to admit that he had made a grave mistake.</p>
      <p>The Liverpudlian backtracked on his initial callout by posting the following hilarious meme.</p>

      <p>“Ahhh fuck,” Till posted with the beer emoji, hinting that he might have been intoxicated the previous night.</p>

      <p>Despite being on a two-fight losing streak, Romero is still considered one of the most dangerous men in the middleweight division and, according to newly-crowned champ Israel Adesanya, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/2/20945240/ufc-244-mma-news-interview-jorge-masvidal-israel-adesanya-yoel-romero-nightclub-fight">one of the ‘baddest’ men on the planet</a>.</p>
      <p>Romero has the power and explosiveness to match his chiselled physique, as the Olympic silver medallist sports several highlight reel knockout victories over the likes of Lyoto Machida, Chris Weidman and Luke Rockhold, with the latter fighter claiming Romero <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/2/12/17003216/ufc-221-mma-news-social-media-luke-rockhold-yoel-romero-fight-steel">‘is made of steel</a>.’</p>

      <p>“Respect to Yoel that man is made of steel,” Rockhold posted in the aftermath of his devastating knockout loss to Romero at UFC 221.</p>
      <p>Romero, 42, last fought earlier this year at UFC 241, where he dropped a unanimous decision to Paulo Costa in a <i>Fight of the Night</i> classic at Anaheim’s Honda Center. The wrestling powerhouse is gunning for a title fight against Adesanya, while Till is rumored to square off against former champ Robert Whittaker in the new year.</p>
