      <p>MUMBAI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/idbi-bank">IDBI Bank</a> on Friday reported its 12th successive quarterly loss of Rs 3,458 crore for the quarter ended September 2019, marginally lower than the loss of Rs 3,602 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, and a loss of Rs 3,800 crore in the preceding quarter ended June 2019.</p>
      <p>The board also decided to sell the bank’s shareholding in IDBI Asset Management (IAML) and IDBI Mutual Fund Trustee (IMTL). The bank’s loan book shrunk 16% to Rs 1.57 lakh crore, while its deposits fell 2% to Rs 2.36 lakh crore. Deposits in current and savings account increased 16% to cross the Rs 1-lakh-crore mark.</p>
      <p>Announcing the results, the bank’s MD &amp; CEO Rakesh Sharma said that the losses were due to accelerated provisioning towards bad loans. The bank made provisions of Rs 4,453 crore during the quarter as against Rs 4,468 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.</p>
      <p>He said that the bank would soon approach the RBI and seek to come out of lending restrictions under the prompt corrective action (PCA) plan that curtails operations of weak banks. “We have managed to bring down our net non-performing assets to below 6%. Our capital adequacy increased to 11.98% and leverage ratio has also improved. On four out of five parameters, we qualify to exit RBI’s prompt corrective action,” said Sharma.</p>
      <p>The bank’s capital adequacy ratio improved following a Rs 9,000-crore capital infusion by the government and its new promoter the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). He said that the bank is in the process of selling its life insurance arm IDBI Federal Life Insurance. “We have appointed JP Morgan as an adviser for the transaction and expect it to be concluded by the end of the year,” said Sharma.</p>
      <p>“We have advertised for sale of NPAs of Rs 9,300 crore. We will be selling these against 100% cash and asset reconstruction companies are conducting due diligence,” said Sharma.</p>
