      <h1>Steven Gerrard calls for Livingston referee 'protection' after highlighting head injury danger</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox boss wants to ensure injuries like the one suffered by Joe Aribo are consigned to the past.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:29:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Berry, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gavin-berry/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has pleaded for referee protection for players in tomorrow’s clash with Livingston after Rangers’ recent bruising encounter in West Lothian.</p>
      <p>Light Blues midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/joe-aribo">Joe Aribo</a> needed 20 stitches to a head wound following an elbow by Ricki Lamie when the sides met in the Betfred Cup in September.</p>
      <p>Ibrox boss Gerrard later claimed the challenge would have resulted in a red card in any other league in the world but Lamie was only cautioned.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gary-holt">Gary Holt</a>’s side have earned a reputation for their robust style of play and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Gerrard</a> warned his players they must be up for the battle when they travel along the M8.</p>
      <p>But the former England captain wants man in the middle Nick Walsh to be ready to take action against any over-the-top challenges from either side.</p>

      <p>Gerrard’s comments come at a time when head injuries to players have been a major talking point with new rugby and cricket-style concussion breaks set to be discussed by British football chiefs.</p>
      <p>There is also the recent study that showed links between football and dementia and Gerrard said: “The last game was an eye-opener because the physios were on for head injuries four, five times in the first half.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot going on in the media at the moment about head injuries, so all we ask is that across the board and for both teams that the referee protects both teams and people are not going off the pitch with 20 stitches in their head because people are leading with their arm.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We expect a certain level of protection. That is not to take away from what <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> are trying to do because we accept the fact that that is their style, we respect that.</p>
      <p>“It is none of our business how they play. But when our players are going down with stitches in their nose and 20 stitches across their head, it is my job to protect the players.</p>
      <p>“The way that concussion works and head injuries, it is across the board in this league. One of the things we can improve is the protection of players when it comes to this type of stuff.</p>
      <p>“Look, we know all about Livingston’s strengths and weaknesses and how they like to play and we will be ready for that challenge.”</p>

      <p>Rangers are looking to make it five wins on the spin in all competitions following Thursday’s 2-0 Europa League victory over Porto as they scrap it out with champions Celtic at the top of the Scottish Premiership.</p>
      <p>Gerrard knows Livi’s Tony Macaroni Arena will be completely different to the euphoria and atmosphere of the victory over the former European champions.</p>
      <p>But he urged his troops to rise to the challenge. Gerrard said: “It will be a different challenge and that was probably what was a big eye opener for us last year in terms of the contrast from game to game and Europa League games to league games or cup games domestically.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It is being ready for the different challenges and we, as a team, in certain games have to adapt to the environment or the style or the personnel we are going to be facing.</p>
      <p>“We have handled that a lot better this year and that is the reason we have posted more consistent results but that is not going to go away. Up until Christmas, we are going to face different styles and systems and we need to be ready for that.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Gerrard dismissed claims from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a>’s Slovakian goalkeeper Vaclav Hladky’s camp that they are in negotiations to sign the player.</p>
