      <p>Condé Nast is beefing up its entertainment division, hiring Reginald Williams as senior vice president of programming.</p>
      <p>Williams comes from Ambrosia For Heads, a hip-hop lifestyle digital media company he founded. Prior to that, he held senior-level roles at BET and MTV.</p>
      <p>Based in New York, he’ll focus on global digital programming, including Condé Nast Entertainment’s podcast team and video and will report to CNE’s president Oren Katzeff.</p>
      <p>“His entrepreneurial instincts and network insights will catapult CNE into its next phase of growth as we aggressively increase our video offerings globally,” said Katzeff, who in typical press release-speak praised Williams’ “entrepreneurial instincts” and “network insights,” proclaiming that these will “catapult CNE into its next phase of growth.”</p>
      <p>Video is the company’s main area of investment and growth as it <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/media/conde-nast-restructuring-continues-1202772994/">shifts</a> from being a print publisher of magazines to a digital publisher for the Internet. It produces around 400 videos annually and in recent months, CNE created a new Hollywood-specific video destination on Vanity Fair’s channel, introduced a video documentary series with The New Yorker and launched a GQ Sports channel on YouTube.</p>
