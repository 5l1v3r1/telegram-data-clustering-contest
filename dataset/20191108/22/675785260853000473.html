      <h1>Neighbour blasts ‘selfish pratt’ blocking postbox in misspelled note left on car</h1>
      <h2>A note left by a furious neighbour accusing a Surrey motorist's parking of obstructing the Royal Mail has been celebrated as extremely British</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:22:09+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:22</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>An angry neighbour has taken aim at a 'selfish' motorist's bad parking - claiming they were preventing the Royal Mail from delivering the post.</p>
      <p>But while most observers could agree the parking left a lot to be desired, the note left on the car had the Internet tickled.</p>
      <p>Scrawled in capital letters that captured the writer's passion for enabling the Royal Mail to carry out its duties - the note was quickly dubbed the 'most British' ever.</p>
      <p>That is except for the spelling, which led an amused Reigate, Surrey resident to post a snap of the note they spotted on reddit.</p>

      <p>They posted a picture of the blue car parked on a pavement, rammed tight against a traditional red mailbox, accompanied by a close-up of the message stuck to its driver's side door.</p>
      <p>Written entirely in upper-case, the note shouted: "Your selfish parking has prevented the Royal Mail from opening the Post Box, causing everyone's letters to be delayed by 24 hours you utter pratt!"</p>
      <p>The pictures were posted overnight on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/dt6dlx/selfish_parking/">r/mildlyinfuriating subreddit dedicated to 'Selfish Parking.'</a></p>
      <p>Many redditors admired the spirit of the note.</p>
      <p>"The car, the note, the parking, the pratt, the royal mail, the postbox. So much Brit," one wrote.</p>
      <p>Others judged a clear misspelling in the note as decidedly un-British.</p>
      <p>One redditor mused: "I think he spelt the insult wrong though, which is somehow less British. By my understanding 'prat' is the insult, 'Pratt' is a surname."</p>

      <p>Others felt the note's rage: "This is the British equivalent of heaving a cinderblock at someone." </p>
      <p>While redditors were divided over whether the parking was really that bad, others had questions about the Royal Mail's decision-making in having the mail box's slot face away from the pavement.</p>
      <p>One redditor pondered: "Why does the mail box even face that way to begin with?"</p>
      <p>But the Royal Mail has since weighed in to assure all concerned that the mail was unaffected.</p>
      <p>A spokesman told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10306959/pratt-motorist-who-blocked-postbox/">Sun</a> : “This note was not left by a Royal Mail worker the driver was in fact able to collect the mail and scan for it. More than likely this note was from a local resident.”</p>
      <p>He added: “There have not been any recorded incidents where we have not been able to collect mail from that area.”</p>
