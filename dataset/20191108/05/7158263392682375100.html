        <b>Original story: October 9, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you ever needed proof that we stray further from God’s light every day, this new Nike sneaker will do the trick. Today, the internet was made aware that a Brooklyn-based brand called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525071&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2F2019%2F10%2Fmschf-inri-air-max-97-walk-on-water-custom-info&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitan.com%2Fstyle-beauty%2Fa29417868%2Fnike-jesus-shoes-holy-water-mschf%2F">MSCHF made a thousand-dollar pair of Nikes</a> that have been dubbed the “Jesus Shoe.”</p>
      <p>Apparently, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525071&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstockx.com%2Fnike-air-max-97-mschf-x-inri-jesus-shoes%3Futm_source%3Daf%26utm_medium%3Drak%26utm_campaign%3D3271293%26ranMID%3D43272%26ranEAID%3D3271293%26ranSiteID%3D9ieob0c66Uo-AcmmJT3SNSa7XqWENg4_Iw&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitan.com%2Fstyle-beauty%2Fa29417868%2Fnike-jesus-shoes-holy-water-mschf%2F">these Nike Air Max 97s</a> are decked out with 60 ccs of holy water sourced straight from the River Jordan and injected into the soles (so you can literally walk on water like Him), a crucifix, red insoles to call back to Vatican traditions, and a Matthew 14:25 inscription. They’re also scented with frankincense, which, according to the Book of Matthew, was one of the gifts the wise men brought to Jesus on the night of his birth. They truly thought of everything here.</p>
      <p>If you feel like you’re being trolled right about now, that’s exactly the point. After the shoes dropped yesterday, the brand’s head of commerce, Daniel Greenberg, told the <i>New York Post</i> that they came up with the idea as <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/08/jesus-shoes-with-actual-holy-water-inside-them-sell-for-3000/">a way to drag “collab culture,”</a> which gave us that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525071&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forever21.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fcatalog%2Fcategory%2Ff21%2Fpromo-usps-collection&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitan.com%2Fstyle-beauty%2Fa29417868%2Fnike-jesus-shoes-holy-water-mschf%2F">Post Office x Forever 21 clothing line</a> and the <a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a28435182/arizona-iced-tea-adidas-99-cent-sneaker-pop-up/">Arizona Iced Tea and Adidas line</a>. The brand asked itself, “What would a collab with Jesus Christ look like?” and came up with this white-and-sky-blue pair.</p>
