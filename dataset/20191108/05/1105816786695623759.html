      <p><b>TEHRAN: </b>A night-time earthquake in northwestern Iran on Friday killed five people and injured 120, according to early reports on state television.</p>
      <p>The 5.9-magnitude quake struck about 120 kilometres (75 miles) southeast of the city of Tabriz, in East Azerbaijan Province, in the early hours of the morning, the Iranian Seismological Center said.<br/>Described as “moderate”, the shallow quake was eight kilometres (five miles) deep and was followed by five aftershocks.</p>
      <p>Provincial governor, Mohammad-Reza Pourmohammadi, told local media that at least 30 houses had been destroyed.</p>
      <p>Rescue operations were underway in 41 rural villages, but the damage was largely concentrated in two areas.</p>

      <p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) issued an alert warning that “significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread”.</p>
      <p>Iran sits where two major tectonic plates meet and experiences frequent seismic activity.</p>
      <p>The country has suffered a number of major disasters in recent decades, including at the ancient city of Bam, which was decimated by a catastrophic earthquake in 2003 that killed at least 31,000 people.</p>
      <p>In 1990, a 7.4-magnitude quake in northern Iran killed 40,000 people, injured 300,000 and left half a million homeless, reducing dozens of towns and nearly 2,000 villages to rubble.</p>
      <p>Iran has experienced at least two other significant quakes in recent years – one in 2005 that killed more than 600 people and another in 2012 that left some 300 dead.</p>
