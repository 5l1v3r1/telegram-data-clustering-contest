      <p>(Nov 8): Most Southeast Asian markets on Friday retreated from the recent risk-on rally, with Singapore falling the most, as sentiment was hit by doubts over Washington's tariff rollback announcement.</p>
      <p>A <i>Reuters</i> exclusive report of fierce internal opposition in the White House to a possible rollback of U.S. tariffs on China diminished initial optimism over a "phase-one" deal being reached between the two.</p>
      <p>The idea of a tariff rollback was not part of the original October "handshake" deal between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. President Donald Trump, sources told <i>Reuters.</i></p>
      <p>China's commerce ministry had said on Thursday that the two sides had agreed on tariff reductions in phases.</p>
      <p>"Investors may remain cautious until they see details. The rollback of existing tariffs is a positive surprise. However, given President Trump's love of tariffs, the additional element may risk prolonging the phase one negotiation," OCBC said in a note.</p>
      <p>U.S. stock futures were down about 0.1% to 0.3% in Asian trade.</p>
      <p>Singapore's benchmark index retreated from a more than three-week high on Thursday, as industrials and financials weakened.</p>
      <p>Casino operator Genting Singapore fell as much as 3.7% on poor third-quarter earnings reported on Thursday, after market hours.<br/><br/>Industrial conglomerate Jardine Strategic Holdings and Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust were among biggest losers, declining as much as 2.9% and 5.8% respectively.</p>
      <p>However, the index is on track to rise for a fifth consecutive week.</p>
      <p>The Philippine bourse hit its lowest in more than a week, dragged by consumer and utilities stocks.</p>
      <p>SM Investments Corp and Aboitiz Equity Ventures were down as much as 1.8% and 1.6% respectively.</p>
      <p>The index was set to post its fifth consecutive weekly gain.</p>
      <p>Indonesian shares extended losses into a third straight session, due to a fall in communication and financial sectors.</p>
      <p>State-owned telecom firm Telekomunikasi Indonesia fell up to 2%, while Bank Central Asia is set to snap four consecutive weekly gains.<br/><br/>An index of the country's 45 most liquid stocks lost as much as 0.8%, set for a third straight loss session.</p>
      <p>Thai stocks were down 0.3%, dragged by real estate and consumer firms, while Malaysia's benchmark index ticked lower.</p>
