      <h1>Day of the week when your home is most likely to get burgled - and why</h1>
      <h2>It's high season for thieves - but don't let your home become a target. As winter sweeps in, along with longer, darker nights, here's how to protect yourself and your possessions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T05:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>November has been named the most common time of the year for break-ins, with one particular day the most likely time for thieves to strike.</p>
      <p>Fridays are prime time for criminals - who'll target the darker nights on their quest for your valuables.</p>
      <p>The research by the Co-op also found that over a third of UK adults have been a victim of neighbourhood crime, with two fifths having had their homes broken into.</p>
      <p>However, a fifth of victims chose not to contact the police.<anchor name="m_-9098853926532850846__Hlk23232316"/></p>
      <p>When asked why this was, over half of people said they weren't convinced that the police would do anything about it while one in six didn't trust that they would be able to help them. </p>
      <p>Just three in five victims who reported the crime said they were visited by the police and less than a third were visited within the hour of the crime being reported.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Of those who didn't receive a police visit, three in five victims were given a crime reference number, whilst one in eight received a phone call.</p>
      <p>Despite this, when asked how the absence of police at the scene of a neighbourhood crime made victims feel, over half said they felt as though they weren't important</p>
      <p>Of those people who have had their properties broken into, eight in ten said the crime has impacted their day-to-day life.</p>
      <p>One in five feel scared that it will happen again, whilst one in six still feel traumatised from the incident. As a result, one in ten have now moved to a new property.</p>
      <p>Colin Butler, at Co-op Insurance said: "Unfortunately, year on year, our claims data shows that darker nights lead to more burglaries. As the nights draw in, we’re urging people to be vigilant when it comes to their personal safety, as well as the safety of their home. </p>
      <p>"Our report unlocks the real issues that people are facing in their neighbourhoods, as well as the long-lasting impact this type of crime can have on victims. Our continuing partnership with Neighbourhood Watch has never been more important as we continue to encourage neighbours to look out for one another."</p>
      <p>John Hayward-Cripps, CEO of Neighbourhood Watch, commented: "It’s worrying that so many people have been a victim of neighbourhood crime.</p>
      <p>"At Neighbourhood Watch, we believe that building strong communities where neighbours look out for each other is key to crime prevention. Being neighbourly and getting involved in your community brings long lasting rewards such as reducing fear of crime and making people proud of where they live.”</p>
