      <p>The American man who took his own wife hostage in a standoff with police before shooting her and himself remains comatose, police said today.</p>
      <p>Bart Allen Helmus is “completely unconscious” at the Sa Kaeo Crown Prince Hospital, Lt. Col. Bunnak Tachoo said, two days after a police dragnet tracked the 39-year-old and two other fugitives from Pattaya to a location near the border with Cambodia.</p>

      <p>Bunnak said Friday morning by phone that Helmus was still in a coma as of yesterday. He didn’t know Helmus’ present condition as of Friday morning and referred inquiries to the hospital. </p>
      <p>Police have notified the U.S. Embassy to in turn inform Helmus’ family, he added.</p>

      <p>Col. Pirom Chandrapirom, chief of police in Sa Kaeo city, where Wednesday’s standoff occurred, said he did not know the current condition of Helmus but said he’s assigned a lower-ranking cop to the hospital room.</p>
      <p>The Sa Kaeo Crown Prince Hospital director Phuwadol Kittwattanasarn said Helmus was brain dead and unresponsive.</p>
      <p>Helmus shot Sirinapa Wisetrit, his wife after taking her hostage as police closed in on the three fugitives in Sa Kaeo’s Wattananakorn district. </p>
      <p>They had been sought after stabbing a cop and busting out of a Pattaya courtroom where they were on trial for drug-related charges.</p>
