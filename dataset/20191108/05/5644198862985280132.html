      <p>SAN FRANCISCO: Walt Disney Co. on Thursday (Nov 7) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, fuelled by the release of blockbuster films "Aladdin" and "The Lion King" as it prepared for its new streaming television service.</p>
      <p>Disney profit in the recently ended quarter was US$1.05 billion, down from US$2.3 billion a year ago, on revenue that grew 34 per cent to US$19.1 billion.</p>

      <p>The slump in profits came as Disney absorbed key film and television operations of 21st Century Fox and geared up for its launch of the streaming service Disney+ that aims to compete globally against Netflix and others.</p>
      <p>"We've spent the last few years completely transforming The Walt Disney Company to focus the resources and immense creativity across the entire company on delivering an extraordinary direct-to-consumer experience," said Disney chief executive Robert Iger.</p>
      <p>"We're excited for the launch of Disney+ on November 12."</p>
      <p>Iger said the company reached a deal for the service to be on Amazon's Fire TV platform, the latest distribution agreement for Disney+.</p>
      <p>Revenues in the past quarter were boosted by a 52 per cent rise in Disney's studio operations with box office hits "The Lion King," "Toy Story 4" and "Aladdin" fueling gains.</p>
      <p>Disney has become the biggest Hollywood player with the acquisition of studio and TV assets from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox.</p>
      <p>The company saw smaller revenue gains in its cable and broadcasting operations as well as its theme park division.</p>
