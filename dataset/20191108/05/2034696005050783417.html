        <b>Get a taster of her debut solo album, taken from the new Peaky Blinders soundtrack</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/SAVAGES">Savages</a>‘ <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/jehnny-beth">Jehnny Beth</a> has shared a taster of her upcoming solo album with first single ‘I’m The Man’. Check it out below.</p>
      <p>A snippet of the track was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/savages-jehnny-beth-launching-solo-peaky-blinders-2545976">first heard in the latest series of <i>Peaky Blinders</i></a>, with the song also set to feature as one of three previously unreleased track of the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/peaky-blinders-soundtrack-release-cd-vinyl-tracklist-2559726">upcoming official <i>Peaky Blinders</i> soundtrack album</a>.</p>
      <p>A journey into different sounds, ‘I’m The Man’ stomps through the sonic terrain of industrial rock and punk, with a brief interlude into ambient piano. Lyrically, it’s an existential questioning of right and wrong.</p>
      <p>“‘I’m The Man’ is an attempted study on humankind, what we define as evil and the inner conflict of morality,” said Beth. “Because it is much easier to label the people who are clearly tormented by obsessions as monsters than to discern the universal human background which is visible behind them.  However, this song has not even a remote connection with a sociological study, collective psychology, or present politics; It is a poetic work first and foremost. Its aim is to make you feel, not think.”</p>
