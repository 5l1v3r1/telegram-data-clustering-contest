      <h1>Athiya Shetty finally opens up about her link-up reports with cricketer KL Rahul</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T05:38:42+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 05:38</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Athiya-Shetty">Athiya Shetty</a> has been in the headlines a long time now for her alleged <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/love-affair">love affair</a> with cricketer KL Rahul. Although the two are yet to come out in open about their relationship, their social media PDA and outings speaks volume about their love affair. So far, both Rahuk and Athiya had neither denied nor accepted their rumoured relationship. However, Athiya, in a recent interview, finally opened up about all the link-up reports doing the rounds in the media.</p>
      <p>Speaking about whether such reports about her personal life bother her, she reportedly said that it doesn’t bother her at all. She added that no matter what the question is people are not going to get any reaction from her side.</p>
      <p>According to the actress, she has always maintained that they give too much of themselves daily. She also reportedly added that this is something so personal and private – whether it's friendship, relationships or family that she wants to protect it and will never talk about it.</p>
      <p>While rumours were already rife that the two are dating each other, Rahul’s recent birthday post for Athiya and her reaction on the social media fuelled the speculations even more.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on the work front, Athiya will next be seen in ‘Motichoor Chaknachoor’. The film will also star <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nawazuddin-Siddiqui">Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a> in the lead role. Directed by Debamitra Biswal, the film will hit the theatres on November 15, 2019.</p>
