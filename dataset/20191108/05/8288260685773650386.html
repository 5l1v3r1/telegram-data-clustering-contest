      <h1>Birmingham parents face having to pay £250 a week extra for childcare</h1>
      <h2>New figures from the government’s annual Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey reveal that the average fee for childcare in Birmingham now comes to £5.00 an hour for two, three and four year olds</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T05:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Annie Gouk, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>The average cost of full-time childcare in Birmingham has soared above £11,500 a year - or nearly four in every £10 of a typical salary.</p>
      <p>New figures from the government’s annual Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey reveal that the average fee for childcare in Birmingham now comes to £5.00 an hour for two, three and four year olds.</p>
      <p>That’s up from £4.75 an hour in 2018.</p>
      <p>With a full-time place usually adding up to 50 hours a week - including commuting time for the parent - that equates to £250 for a week, or £11,600 a year, for a single child.</p>
      <p>A full-time worker in Birmingham is typically paid £27,426 a year - which means a childcare place costs 42% of the average salary.</p>
      <p>The government does offer between 15 and 30 hours of free childcare a week, but the full amount is only available to some parents, and in many cases there are not enough providers available to meet demand.</p>
      <p>Charities say it means parents are being locked out of work, which also results in too many children missing out on high-quality childcare and the improved life-chances that brings.</p>
      <p>The situation in Birmingham is worse than the national average.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The average fee for childcare across England is £5.16 an hour for two year olds and £5.04 an hour for three and four year olds.</p>
      <p>It means the average parent is paying up to £11,971 a year for a full time childcare place - 39% of the average national salary of £30,661 a year.</p>

      <p>Josh Cottell, research and policy officer at Coram Family and Childcare, said: “Childcare is every bit as vital as schools, healthcare or transport: it supports parents to work, provides our economy with a reliable workforce and boosts children’s outcomes.</p>
      <p>“But too many parents remain locked out of work by high childcare costs and low availability, and too many children miss out on high quality childcare, and the benefits to their life-chances that come with it.</p>
      <p>“Recent government investment is welcome, but as prices continue to rise, families remain at risk of getting left behind. For many parents, making work pay is an uphill struggle.</p>

      <p>“On top of this, our research shows that just 57 per cent of local authorities in England have enough childcare for parents working full time.</p>
      <p>“The government needs to streamline the current maze of childcare support schemes so that families can understand what they are entitled to and access the childcare they need.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We need a simple and responsive childcare system that makes sure every parent is better off working and childcare quality is high enough to boost children’s outcomes throughout life.”</p>
