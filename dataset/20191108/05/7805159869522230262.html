      <p>While Xiaomi does offer flagship smartphones in a few markets, its entry-level and mid-range devices are what it’s known for. In fact, the company’s Redmi brand is so popular that it now even offers <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/redmi-k20-pro-xiaomi-mi-9t-pro-review-flagship/">affordable flagships like the Redmi K20 Pro</a>. Recently, the company launched the Redmi 8 and Redmi 8A in the budget-segment, offering great hardware specifications for the price. In order to provide users with a common platform for discussions related to these devices, we’ve now opened forums for the Redmi 8 and Redmi 8A.</p>
      <h3>Redmi 8</h3>
      <p>The Redmi 8 was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-8-india-launch-snapdragon-439/">launched in India</a> early last month at a price of ₹7,999. The device features a 6.22-inch HD+ LCD display with a waterdrop notch that houses the 8MP front-facing camera. On the back, you get a dual-camera setup with a 12MP primary lens and a 2MP lens for depth perception. The smartphone is powered by a Snapdragon 439 chip, coupled with up to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It’s backed by a massive 5,000mAh battery with 18-watt fast charging support over USB Type-C.</p>

      <h3>Redmi 8A</h3>
      <p>The Redmi 8A, on the other hand, was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-8a-india-launch/">launched earlier this year</a> in September and offers similar specifications as the Redmi 8. It also has a 6.22-inch HD+ LCD display with a waterdrop notch on the front that houses the 8MP selfie shooter. On the back, however, it features a single 12MP f/1.8 camera. The Snapdragon 439 chip can also be found on this device, with up to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Powering the device is a 5,000mAh battery which also has 18-watt fast charging support over USB Type-C, but you only get a 10-watt charger in the box.</p>
