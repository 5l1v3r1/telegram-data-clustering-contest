        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - France is interested in scientific cooperation with Russia across various disciplines, including the field of artificial intelligence, Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences Catherine Brechignac said on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"We also can cooperate, and we are thinking about that, in the field of artificial intelligence, in the field of mathematics," Brechignac said during a session of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.</blockquote>
      <p>She noted that there were many avenues of cooperation between French and Russian scientists, within many available formats.</p>
      <blockquote>"In 2020, the International Congress of Mathematicians will be held in Saint Petersburg, and, of course, we must prepare for it," Brechignac added.</blockquote>
      <p>She also <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201905101074886053-art-ai-exhibition-opening/">recalled</a> the planned 2024 joint session on academic cooperation during the Cold War.</p>
      <blockquote>"This is important because in an atmosphere of certain difficulties between politicians, scientific cooperation is especially important. And I know that during the Cold War there was a serious and deep scientific cooperation," the secretary elaborated.</blockquote>
      <p>France has a strong tradition of science and cultural diplomacy dating back to the Charles de Gaulle presidency, promoting research projects with other countries across the globe. The importance of non-political connection is becoming especially important amid the current state of Europe-Russia relations, which were damaged by the former's negative reaction to Crimea's reunification with Russia in 2014.</p>
