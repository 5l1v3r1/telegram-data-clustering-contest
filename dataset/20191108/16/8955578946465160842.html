      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 8 – RIA Tomsk.</b> Russian scientists, including employees of the <a href="http://en.tsu.ru/">Tomsk State University</a> (TSU), plan to create a network with French researchers to study environmental changes in Siberia and the Arctic; it is expected that the relevant agreement will be signed in 2020, the press service of TSU reported on Friday.</p>
      <p>According to the press service, scientists of TSU, V.E. Zuev Institute of Atmospheric Optics SB RAS, Siberian Federal University, Moscow State University, Institute of Geography RAS together with colleagues from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) discussed creation of network for a research of changes of the environment in Siberia and the Arctic during the working seminar in Paris.</p>
      <blockquote>"The French are interested in doing research in this territory. They are ready to combine scientific potential and their resources with Russian centers within the framework of a joint network, which has already received the working name "From tundra to steppe." &lt;…&gt; The next step will be to present it to the management of scientific centers of Russia and France – potential participants of the network – and to the government of the two countries", – the message says.</blockquote>
      <p>With reference to the Director of the Center of Excellence "BioClimLand" of TSU Sergey Kirpotin, it is reported that Tomsk scientists presented a megatransect (a line of research stations and all-season sampling points for studying environmental changes) in Paris, allowing to conduct research throughout the year. It is intended to create a new transect from west to east along the gradient of the continental nature of Siberia.</p>

      <p>The territory of Siberia and the Arctic has an influence on climate formation, so foreign scientists are interested in the possibility to get new information about demonstrations of global warming and its possible consequences, the press service notes. It is planned to sign an agreement on the establishment of a joint network in 2020. Combining forces will allow scientists to obtain a synergistic effect.</p>
      <p>"The French have very developed technologies of remote sensing of the Earth, which are optimally suitable for exploration of Siberia and the Arctic due to their huge spaces and availability of hard-to-reach places, for example, such as Vasyugan marshes. (Also) there are very strong specialists in biogeochemistry in France. This direction has a huge role in the study of climate", – Kirpotin words are quoted.</p>
