      <p>The US has a "very good" relationship with India and a lot of things are happening between the two countries, US President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Trump, who has accepted an invitation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to travel to India, said that he would be going there at some point of time.</p>
      <p>"We have a lot of things happening with India. We have a very good relationship with India," Trump told reporters on the South Lawns of the White House when asked about the progress in his trade deal with India.</p>
      <p>Trump, during his meeting with Modi in New York in September, said the two countries are working on a trade deal.</p>
      <p>Officials from both India and the US have said that the work is in progress and are hoping to ink it before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>"We are dealing with India on a lot of different things," Trump said in response to questions. However, he did not elaborate.</p>
      <p>Prime Minster Modi "is a very good friend of mine," Trump said as he referred to the historic 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston in September.</p>
