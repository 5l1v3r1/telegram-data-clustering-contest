      <p>Teaser sketches <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/380451/2021-kia-optima-k5-teaser/">continue to reveal</a> the look of the new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/kia/optima/">Kia Optima</a> (or K5 in the South Korean market). At this rate, the model's design isn't going to be much of surprise by the time we see it in the metal.</p>

      <p>The new sketch is<a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/379049/2021-kia-optima-teaser-images/"> similar to a previous one</a> but fully reveals the side of the car. The new Optima appears to have fairly smooth flanks that flow back to a prominent bulge at the rear fenders. The roof as a coupe-like silhouette. At the back, there's a short deck, and taillights span the entire width. A sporty rear fascia includes a diffuser and integrated exhausts.</p>

      <p>The earlier sketches reveal the new Optima's more aggressive front end with a highly contoured nose and large inlets in the lower fascia. The grille is a more exaggerated version of the company's existing "tiger nose" style. Revised headlights feature small lamps and jagged, lightning-bolt-shaped LED running lights.</p>
      <p>Inside, Kia looks to adopt the modern style of combining a digital instrument cluster with a wide infotainment screen next to it. There's a simple center console with a rotary dial and some buttons. The overall aesthetic is minimalist in comparison to the more dramatic exterior.</p>
      <p>There's less info about the powertrain range at this time. <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/366331/2021-kia-optima-spied/">At the very least</a>, expect improved <a href="https://www.motor1.com/kia/optima-hybrid/">hybrid</a> and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/kia/optima-plug-in-hybrid/">PHEV</a> choices to be available.</p>
      <p>While Kia is teasing the K5 for the South Korean market, don't look for the new Optima's unveiling until 2020. The current speculation puts its American on-sale date in the 2021 model year.</p>
