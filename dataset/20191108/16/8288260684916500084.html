      <h3>INJURIES</h3>
      <p>For the first time under Nuno Espirito Santo's stewardship Wolves are dealing with some injury concerns. Willy Boly is out long term, whilst Ryan Bennett and Romain Saiss have both been struggling with their own injury issues.</p>
      <h4>Willy Boly</h4>
      <p><b>Injury: </b>Broken Fibula</p>
      <p><b>Details: </b>Boly was injured as the side prepared for the visit to Newcastle United, it is suspected he has suffered a broken fibula and he will be assessed in the coming days.</p>
      <p><b>What Wolves have said: </b>Wolves physio Phil Hayward confirmed that the Frenchman had surgery to repair the broken bone and will now be in a protective boot for six weeks.</p>

      <p>“Willy had surgery in London this morning to repair the bone with a small metal plate and screws," said Phil Hayward.</p>
      <p>“The procedure went as planned with no complications and he will now return to Compton to begin the early stages of his rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>“Willy will be in a boot for the first six weeks, working hard to maintain fitness and muscle bulk in the leg before progressing to more functional activities.</p>
      <p>“In terms of time scales, a lot depends on how he progresses in the first few weeks and how well the fracture heals.”</p>
      <h4>Morgan Gibbs-White</h4>

        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Injury: </b>Lower back</p>
      <p><b>Details: </b>The youngster missed Wolves' win over Slovan Bratislava and has been struggling with a lower back injury. Earlier this week, Nuno revealed after the game that he was unable to train and is a major doubt for Villa.</p>
      <p><b>What Wolves have said:</b> “We still have to take care of him. This low back pain that he has, we tried to offload. Today he is not on the bench, but Bennett has come back and Saiss is better. It is about managing the squad I hope Morgan can join us.”</p>
