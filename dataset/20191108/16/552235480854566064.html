      <h1>Cancer-stricken OAP trapped in home for seven months over ramp row</h1>
      <h2>May Holmes is housebound while she waits for the council to install a ramp at her Lochwinnoch home.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:02:25+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:02</time> by <a rel="author">Alison Rennie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/alison-rennie/</a></address>
      <p>A pensioner with terminal cancer has been trapped in her own home for seven months waiting on a ramp to be fitted at her front door.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, May Holmes was diagnosed with cancer, which started in her thyroid and is now in her bones.</p>
      <p>Doctors have said the cancer is terminal, but she may be able to live with it for a couple of years.</p>
      <p>The disease has affected her mobility and she now walks with a Zimmer frame and uses a wheelchair.</p>
      <p>Since her diagnosis, she’s been unable to manage the three steps to get in and out of her home in Lochwinnoch, leaving her effectively housebound.</p>
      <p>May, 71, said: “I asked for a ramp, but the council has given me all sorts of reasons why it can’t install one.</p>
      <p>“I’m in a four-in-a-block and my neighbour has bought his house. They said they couldn’t install the ramp because it would go over part of his garden but, he’s told me he’s happy for a ramp to go in.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We suggested changing my bedroom window at the back into a patio door and putting the ramp out the back into my part of the garden, but I was told that would affect the structure.</p>
      <p>“They’ve offered me a stair climber and said they’d train me how to use it, but all my friends are the same age as me and aren’t confident about using it.</p>
      <p>“The only time I’m out is when I go to the Beatson and the ambulance comes to collect me.</p>
      <p>“I go to the hospice as well, but I’m taken there.”</p>
      <p>May used to be an active member of the community, volunteering for the Red Cross for years and also offering pastoral support for the local church.</p>
      <p>She’s lived in her home since 1984 and would love to have the independence to go out and see her friends, attend church and the library.</p>
      <p>She said: “My cancer is terminal. The consultant initially said I might have a few months, but they’ve since said it could be a few years.</p>
      <p>“I can’t say I’m depressed not getting out, but it does have an effect on me. I have a lot of visitors, but on days when I don’t I can feel a bit down.</p>
      <p>“There are days when I could have gone out myself to get a coffee or go to the library, but I can’t.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>May’s friend Mary Stewart said: “May is a very bright person. She’s started learning the ukelele and has an iPad and is learning to use it.</p>
      <p>“She’s more than capable of being part of the community.</p>
      <p>“I feel dreadful that she’s stuck inside so much.</p>
      <p>“Her friends are all round about her and are happy to help her get out.”</p>
      <p>A Renfrewshire Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: “We want to support everyone in Renfrewshire to be able to live independently wherever possible.</p>
      <p>“We are assisting the resident to identify a suitable solution, working with Renfrewshire Council’s housing and legal departments to advise on the requirements and implications of fitting a ramp on another person’s property.”</p>
