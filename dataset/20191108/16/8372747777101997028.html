      <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla. â€” There are new "students" at Cape Coral High School, but it's not what you think.</p>
      <p>Today, Mrs. Lori Shaw, The Global Studies Club, and environmental studies students released native turtles into the pond in front of the school.</p>
      <p>Last month, students planted one-thousand aquatic plants in the pond as part of a restoration project.</p>
      <p>The pond will teach students sustainable landscape principles and water quality testing.</p>
      <p>They will also be able to measure biodiversity and record their progress over time.</p>
