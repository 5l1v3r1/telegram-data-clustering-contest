      <h1>Massive Rs 1.7 lakh off on Mahindra Marazzo M8</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rivan RS</a></address>
      <p>While the entry-level Marazzo M2 prices remain unchanged, Mahindra dealers are also offering massive benefits on the mid-spec M4 and M6 trims.</p>
      <p>Mahindra’s Marazzo MPV has made the impression that the Indian UV maker was hoping for. It is seen as a slightly more premium alternative to the Maruti Suzuki Ertiga and comes with a price tag that overlaps with the Maruti XL6, while still undercutting the more expensive (and larger) Toyota Innova Crysta.</p>
      <p>Mahindra dealerships across the nation are now offering massive discounts and benefits of up to Rs 1.7 lakh on the MPV, including cash and corporate discounts, along with an exchange bonus. The highest of the benefits, worth up to a whopping Rs 1.7 lakh, is available on the top-spec Marazzo M8 variant, while lower trims get a slightly lower level of benefit – Rs 60,000 on the Marazzo M4 and up to Rs 1.1 lakh on the M6. However, the entry-level Marazzo M2 is not available with any benefits during November.</p>
      <p>As Mahindra’s MPV is currently priced between Rs 9.99-14.77 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the benefits bring the mid-spec Marazzo prices very close to the respective Maruti Suzuki XL6 and Ertiga 1.5 diesel variants.</p>
      <p>The table below has the details:</p>

      <p>Available with a sole 1.5-litre diesel engine, which is tuned to deliver 121hp and 300Nm of torque, the Marazzo has a single gearbox option – a 6-speed manual – for now. An AMT-equipped model is in the works but is not expected to arrive until 2020. There’s a petrol-powered Marazzo coming around that time too.</p>
      <p>The Marazzo comes with seven- and eight-seat configurations, and is currently the safest, affordable MPV in India. When it underwent Global NCAP’s crash tests, the Marazzo was awarded a 4-star safety rating – in comparison, the Maruti Ertiga got 3 stars while the Renault Lodgy got a 0-star rating.</p>
