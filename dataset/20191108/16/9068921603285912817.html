      <p>In an ongoing effort to keep track of upcoming (and current) Black Friday sales, we've begun highlighting the biggest and best discounts offered by major retailers. Yesterday we started with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/07/black-friday-spotlight-best-buy/">Best Buy</a>, and today we're moving on to Target. <br/><br/><a href="https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftarget-black-friday%2F-%2FN-5q0f2%3Flnk%3DBlackFridaysnea">Target's Black Friday sale</a> is set to be massive and will extend across home furniture, clothing, video games, and of course electronics. Target will open its doors at 5 p.m. local time on Thanksgiving evening, close them at 1 a.m. Friday morning, and then re-open at 7 a.m. Friday morning.</p>

The same offer will be available for the <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fs%3FsearchTerm%3Diphone%2Bxs">iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max</a>. <br/><br/>You'll also be able to get the new <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-10-2-inch-wi-fi-only-7th-generation%2F-%2FA-78305935%3Fpreselect%3D54184213%23lnk%3Dsametab">32GB 10.2-inch iPad</a> for $249.99, down from $329.99, representing the lowest-ever price on this model. <br/><br/>Next up, the retailer will offer the <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fs%3FsearchTerm%3Dapple%2Bwatch%2Bseries%2B3">Apple Watch Series 3</a> starting at $169.99 and totaling $30 savings across multiple styles. The newest Apple Watch, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fs%3FsearchTerm%3Dapple%2Bwatch%2Bseries%2B5">Series 5</a>, will remain priced at its regular point starting at $399.99 for GPS and $499.99 for cellular. <br/><br/>There will be a chance for some <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapp-store-itunes-email-delivery%2F-%2FA-52960561%3Fpreselect%3D52608754%23lnk%3Dsametab">App Store and iTunes gift card</a> savings. Target plans to offer buy one, get one 30 percent off on these gift cards, where the lower-priced gift card will be 30 percent off.
