      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-falls-below-9-000-as-price-teases-trading-corridor-breakdown">Falling</a> below $9,000, Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) has seen another dip today and its price dropped over $200 in an hour.</p>
      <p>Alongside Bitcoin, the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are seeing major losses of nearly 10% over the past 24 hours, according to data from <a href="https://coin360.com/table">Coin360</a>.</p>

      <p>Among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, Unus Sed Leo (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/unus-sed-leo-leo">LEO</a>) is the only coin seeing gains at press time. The altcoin is up 1% to trade at $0.99 at the time of this writing.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Algorand (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/algorand-algo">ALGO</a>), the 20th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is down more than 10% over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.24.</p>
      <p>The total crypto market capitalization presently accounts for $237 billion, according to <a href="https://coin360.com/table">Coin360</a>.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/manipulation-cme-bitcoin-futures-flash-crash-to-fill-85k-gap">reported</a> on Nov. 5, some analysts say new sharp movements in Bitcoin’s price are filling in futures gaps. These gaps abruptly crash the market by hundreds of dollars before recovering minutes later, and they’re observed in situations when one session ends higher or lower than where the next one begins. Filling in futures gaps has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-falls-below-9-000-as-price-teases-trading-corridor-breakdown">reportedly</a> become standard for Bitcoin, with analysts using them to predict potential declines in the market.</p>
      <p>Major crypto bull Mike Novogratz <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-president-xi-credentialized-cryptocurrency-says-novogratz">suggested</a> on Nov. 6 that the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price was triggered by China’s President Xi Jinping <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-chinas-xi-jinping-urges-accelerated-blockchain-technology-adoption">calling</a> the country to accelerate blockchain adoption in late October. After China <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bullish-for-bitcoin-china-scraps-plans-to-ban-cryptocurrency-mining">confirmed</a> it’s not planning to mine Bitcoin in the country anymore, the market’s new downward movement contradicts Novogratz’s statement.</p>
      <p>Not the Bitcoin market’s best day.</p>
