      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:03:03+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> has claimed it is “no surprise” his former Celtic boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> is competing with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> for a Champions League place.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> boss has revealed he turned down a £10m for Tierney in his first week in the Hoops job back in May 2016.</p>
      <p>The Scotland full-back and Rodgers went on to win seven trophies together before the Northern Irishman controversially left Celtic Park in February – and Tierney followed him south for £25m in the summer.</p>
      <p>“I have not spoken to Brendan much at all,” said Tierney, 22. “He sent me a text congratulating me on the move, but that’s it since.</p>
      <p>“We have seen what he did at Celtic with the team that he had and the trophies we won together, so it is no surprise that he’s doing well.</p>

      <p>“If you are going by the start of the season then yeah of course Leicester are Champions League contenders, but it is about us. We need to concentrate on what we can do this season.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal have won only one game in six since the international break but Tierney said the Leicester match was a chance to get their campaign back on track.</p>
      <p>“It is a massive chance for us,” he said. “But no matter what the game would be for us on Saturday, it would be a massive chance.</p>
      <p>"It is going to be tough, we know that and we are prepared for that. There are lots of games for us now in this period, but we have got the squad for it.</p>

      <p>"It is a challenge we are looking forward to. It is another great test for us. It will be a hard game there, they are doing well now.</p>
      <p>"So to go away there and get a result would be brilliant.”</p>
      <p>Rodgers, who has led Leicester into the top four ahead of Arsenal, recalled: “The very first week I was there I was told that there was interest from Arsenal for around about 10 million quid.</p>
      <p>“Peter Lawwell was very clear that this was an opportunity that was there for Kieran. But obviously we didn’t want the player to go and it was my job to try to convince him to stay.</p>

      <p>“You have to be transparent with players in a situation like that so I just said, ‘Listen, we could have a great cycle here. I really want to develop you and make you a better player’.</p>
      <p>“I think very quickly he enjoyed the training, he enjoyed the work and he enjoyed the culture we were trying to create. Thankfully he decided he was going to commit to another deal which was absolutely great news for us all.</p>
      <p>“He was a big talent and we wanted to hang on to our best talents.</p>
      <p>“So he stayed and he gave everything to Celtic, increased his market value and then ended up moving there for the price that he did.”</p>
