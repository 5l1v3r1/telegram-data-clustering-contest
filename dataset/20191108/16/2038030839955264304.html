      <p>Johannesburg – While we're not sure exactly when it will happen, we're pretty sure Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters and Tim Tebow will be tying the knot any day now.  </p>
      <p>The couple got <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/former-miss-sa-demi-leigh-engaged-to-american-sport-star-tim-tebow-20190110"><b>engaged</b></a> in January and have been pretty tight-lipped about when their big day will be. But we're not entirely out of the loop, both Demi and Tim have spoken about their wedding in interviews and even on their social media pages.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's what we know about their wedding so far: </b>

        <b>Demi's in charge </b>
      </p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/06/20/tim-tebow-talks-first-film-lessons-wedding-planning-no-groomzilla/1505951001/"><b>USA Today</b></a>, Tim Tebow mentioned that he is leaving all of the planning in the capable hands of his beautiful fiancée.  </p>
      <p>"I just think it's getting all the people I love and care about together. That will be good enough for me. And then whatever Demi wants. It's perfect. She has ideas and ways to make it really pretty, and she's so excited about it," he said.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Their pics will definitely be on social media </b>
      </p>
      <p>The couple took to Instagram recently to <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/demi-leigh-and-tim-tebow-need-your-help-with-their-wedding-hashtag-20190918"><b>ask fans for help in choosing a hashtag</b></a> for their big day, which means that we can look forward to seeing those pics all over our Instagram feeds, and we can't wait.   </p>

        <b>They've hired SA event planner Zavion Kotze </b>
      </p>
      <p>Event planner and <i>Wedding Bashers</i> star <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/zavion-kotze-is-designing-demi-leigh-nel-peters-dream-wedding-20191106"><b>Zavion Kotze</b></a> will be helping Demi get the wedding of her dreams. Both Zavion and Demi shared the news on their Instagram accounts.  </p>

        <b>There will be a few beauty queens on the guestlist </b>
      </p>
      <p>Demi recently attended former Miss USA <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/Pageant/former-miss-usa-sarah-rose-summers-ties-the-knot-and-demi-leigh-was-there-20191021"><b>Sarah Rose Summers' wedding</b></a> in the US, so it only makes sense that some of her pageant sisters will be joining her on her wedding day as well. </p>
      <p>While she did not mention exactly who, Demi told <b>Channel24</b> during our chat in August that she has extended an invite to a few of her fellow beauty queens.          </p>
