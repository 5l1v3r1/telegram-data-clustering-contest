      <p>Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge was one of the most anticipated additions to any theme park in years. An entire land dedicated to Star Wars was sure to be popular, and while there are those that claim the land hasn't been as successful as expected, there's no question that the people are coming to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478897/wait-times-on-other-popular-disney-world-rides-are-bonkers-thanks-to-star-wars-galaxys-edge?pv=search">Galaxy's Edge</a>. Not only that, they're apparently staying and going to other theme parks as well.</p>
      <p>While Disneyland revealed in August that the park had seen a slight decline in attendance. Ceder Fair, the parent company of Knott's Berry Farm, recently revealed in a conference call with investors (via the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2019/11/06/knotts-berry-farm-reports-record-attendance-after-disneyland-opens-star-wars-galaxys-edge/">OC Register</a>) that the park is on track to have a record year for attendance.</p>
      <p>It's certainly not too surprising that attendance at Knott's Berry Farm has been on the rise. It's another theme park that's only a short drive away from <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477955/10-attractions-that-are-better-at-disneyland-than-walt-disney-world?pv=search">Disneyland.</a> So if you're a local, it's as easy to get there from the Disneyland Resort, and if you're on vacation, it's another place to go. It seems likely that people who went to visit Galaxy's Edge wanted to make the most of their time in the area, and probably hopped over to check out Knott's Berry Farm as well.</p>
      <p>The fact is, if you're a fan of thrill rides, then Knott's Berry Farm is a place worth going. While Disneyland certainly has no lack of roller coasters, that's not the resort's focus, Knott's has a lot more roller coasters and similar thrill ride experiences.</p>
      <p>While it's true that Disneyland's attendance has been down slightly this year, Disney's earning call yesterday conformed that is still the case, that's far from bad news for <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2459482/5-Things-That-Should-Be-Added-To-Downtown-Disney-At-Disneyland?pv=search">Disneyland Resort</a>. Operating income at the California park was up because, while fewer people might be walking through the gates, those that are doing so are spending more money.</p>
      <p>This is exactly the situation <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477789/disneylands-attendance-has-been-down-since-galaxys-edge-opened-but-its-actually-a-good-thing?pv=search">that Disney wants</a>. Fewer guests means <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474277/looks-like-disneyland-finally-figured-out-lines-with-star-wars-galaxys-edge?pv=search">an easier load</a> on cast members, and a better guest experience for those in attendance. Happier guests spend money, and Disney makes more money. If attendance increases, that just becomes additional revenue on top of success.</p>
      <p>While Disney and Knott's may technically be competitors, they also can help each other. If one location can draw vacationers with a new attraction, those guests won't need to have their arm twisted too much to check out the other place too.</p>
      <p>Also, while we don't know exactly what sort of attendance numbers we're actually talking about, While Knott's attendance may be growing, it certainly isn't at Disneyland levels. The increase is simply evidence that Knott's is moving in the right direction.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478825/we-toured-star-wars-rise-of-the-resistance-and-its-a-total-game-changer-of-a-ride?pv=search">Rise of the Resistance</a> set to open at Disneyland in January, there's a good chance that we'll see yet another influx of tourists and locals to the area theme parks. Disney thinks a lot of potential guests have been holding off trips to both Disneyland and Walt Disney World until the land is "complete." Disneyland will see a surge early next year, and that surge might also give Knott's Berry Farm a boost in the new year, setting them up to potentially have another record year.</p>
