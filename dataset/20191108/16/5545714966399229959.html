      <p>And there it is. The Xbox One version of<i> Stardew Valley </i>now supports online multiplayer.</p>
      <p>Update 1.3 has slowly but surely made the rounds across PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4. After a few false starts with certification, Xbox One players <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-3-multiplayer-update-is-now-available/">can try four-player co-op too</a>. If this is your first time playing <i>Stardew Valley</i> with friends, you're in for a treat – you can even use emotes!</p>
      <p>There's also new content in 1.3, including a winter Night Market (on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, starting at 5:00pm near the ocean docks) and the Auto-Grabber, a tool to help you harvest milk and wool.</p>
      <p>As for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../stardew-valley-creator-calls-upcoming-version-1-4-the-everything-update-aims-to-add-massive-changes-throughout-the-game-569126.phtml">update 1.4</a> – the one that "touches pretty much every aspect of the game in some way or another" – it's coming soon to PC. "Just finishing up a few final things," said designer Eric Barone.</p>
      <p>"It's very close."</p>
