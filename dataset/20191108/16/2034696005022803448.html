      <p>Steve Carell has presented a new idea for a reboot of <i>The Office</i>, and it’s brilliant.</p>
      <p>The star, who played Michael Scott in the legendary sitcom, explained his idea while appearing on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The show finished in 2013, and since then there have been plenty of rumours of a reboot, though none in the way that Carell envisages.</p>
      <p>“You know what I thought would be great for <i>The Office</i>?” he told Ellen. “Not reboot <i>The Office</i>, but take <i>The Office</i> cast and reboot <i>Cheers</i>.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “So, like I would be Sam, and Jenna would be.. You know, just take different characters. It’s a terrible idea.”</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-office-to-leave-netflix-2517498"><i>The Office</i> is set to leave Netflix</a>. NBCUniversal’s adaptation of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s mockumentary sitcom will move over to the broadcaster’s forthcoming streaming service Peacock as of January 2021.</p>
      <p>Two of the show’s cast members <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/cast-office-reunite-new-podcast-series-2548734">recently reunited for new podcast series Office Ladies</a>, in which Jenna Fischer (Pam Beesly) and Angela Kinsey (Angela Martin) watch a different episode of <i>The Office</i> every week and share their reactions and memories.</p>
      <p>Last year, the cast of<i> The Office</i><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/watch-the-cast-of-the-office-beg-steve-carell-to-take-part-in-a-reboot-2403756"> jokingly begged Steve Carell to take part</a> in a revival of the show. It came after it was revealed <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/the-us-office-season-10-release-date-trailer-cast-2322717">that NBC could revive the show once more</a>, and the cast interrupted Carrell with the request as he was trying to deliver a monologue on <i>SNL</i>.</p>
