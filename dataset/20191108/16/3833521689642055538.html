      <h1>Scores missing after attack near Semafo mine in Burkina Faso</h1>

      <p>Scores of people are still missing after Wednesday’s attack near a Canadian-owned mine in Burkina Faso in which 38 people were killed, the worst such incident in the West African nation struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency.</p>
      <p>The death toll was 38, Defense Minister Cherif Moumouna Sy said Friday following a visit to the region. A further 63 people were injured, with the most severely wounded brought to the capital, Ouagadougou, Sy told Radiodiffusion Television du Burkina. Government spokesman Remy Fulgance Dandjinou said about 40 people remained unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>“Our troops are on the ground because we also have some elements that are missing, some mine workers that we are looking for,” Sy said.</p>
      <p>Unidentified gunmen attacked a convoy under military escort transporting workers of Canadian gold miner Semafo Inc. about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the company’s Boungou mine in the eastern Est region. While the mine was unaffected, operations were suspended out of respect for the victims, Semafo said.</p>
      <p>The attack comes as several West African countries are battling Islamist insurgents who are increasingly disrupting business and forcing governments to abandon large swathes of territory. The raids have spread from Sahel countries such as Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso toward the borders with coastal nations, including Ghana and Ivory Coast.</p>
      <p>Semafo’s stock closed 4.9 per cent down at $3.32 in Toronto on Thursday after dropping as much as 7.2 per cent, the lowest since Feb. 15. Shares in Australia’s Perenti Global dropped 12 per cent after the Perth-based mining contractor said 19 members of its workforce were killed in the incident. The Perth-based mining-service provider also suspended operations.</p>
