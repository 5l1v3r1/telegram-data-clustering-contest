      <p>Luckily she said yes.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/weddings">wedding</a> came to a halt during the bouquet toss when, instead of throwing the flowers as is traditional, the bride turned around and calmly walked over to her brother’s girlfriend and handed them to her directly. The guest then turned around where she was met with the sight of her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/relationships">boyfriend</a> down on one knee.</p>
