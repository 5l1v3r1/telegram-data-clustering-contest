      <h2>Rosie Anne Brindley developed a lump in her neck but medics failed to correctly diagnose she was suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma and could have survived if it was treated</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:57:27+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">Ciaran Fagan, Lorraine King</a></address>
      <p>Doctors repeatedly missed the chance to diagnose and treat a young girl's cancer which ultimately killed her, an inquest has ruled.</p>
      <p>Despite Rosie Anne Brindley seeing a number of GPs and specialists and undergoing tests, medics failed to establish that she was suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
      <p>The 10-year-old from Loughborough, developed a lump in her neck in early 2015 but a biopsy was never taken and the results of subsequent MRI and ultrasound scans were 'misinterpreted', <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/our-little-girl-died-after-3513841">Leicestershire Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>She died in July 2016 after the undiagnosed cancer attacked Rosie's immune system leaving her powerless against septicaemia.</p>
      <p>The infection is what killed her, a coroner said today at the conclusion of a four-day inquest.</p>

      <p>The hearing, which took place in Rosie's home town, heard that on the day before her death in July 2016, Rosie came home from school feeling unwell and went to bed.</p>
      <p>Her father, found her unconscious when he went to wake her the next morning.</p>
      <p>She was pronounced dead at home a short time later after efforts to resuscitate her proved fruitless.</p>
      <p>Assistant coroner Tanyka Rawden said it was "unlikely" Rosie would have died if her treatment had been different.</p>

      <p>The little girl's parents, Stefan Brindley and Samantha Rowley-Hill, said they hoped lessons would be learned from her treatment and that her legacy would be the prevention of further deaths.</p>
      <p>Samantha, 42, said: "Rosie was a very happy and loving little girl.</p>
      <p>"We moved to Loughborough from Thurmaston four years ago and literally didn't know a single person.</p>
      <p>"Within a week of moving into our house Rosie got to know people, including some of the older people who live close by. </p>
      <p>"Before we knew it, we would be walking down the street and someone would say 'you're Rosie's parents aren't you?'.</p>

      <p>"Even though we told her not to talk to strangers, there was something in her nature that made her want to meet people.</p>
      <p>"She had a big heart and we miss her every day.</p>
      <p>Stefan, 41, said: "Rosie always wanted to help people.</p>
      <p>"She always put others before herself and she never let her illness stop her.</p>
      <p>"She was always so brave."</p>

      <p>In her conclusion, assistant coroner Ms Rawden said it was "more likely than not" that Rosie was exhibiting early symptoms of the cancer when she visited her GP in April 14, 2015 when the family became worried about the lump in her neck.</p>
      <p>At that stage, Ms Rawden said, the cancer would not have been "extensive" or "life-threatening.</p>
      <p>"The "misinterpretation" of subsequent scans, particularly an ultrasound test, resulted in a Rosie being referred to a team which was not managed by paediatric oncologists.</p>
      <p>Ms Rawden said: "Had the ultrasound scan of October 14, 2015 been correctly interpreted, it is likely that Rosie would have been referred on the correct pathway.</p>
      <p>"Had she been so referred, it is unlikely she would have have died."</p>

      <p>The assistant coroner told  <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/all-about/leicester-hospitals">the University of Leicester Hospitals Trust</a> , which runs the centres where Rosie was treated, to reconsider its position on holding an inquiry.</p>
      <p>This was necessary, she said, because a number of medical staff members who gave evidence to the inquest had indicated they would follow the same course of action if presented with the same circumstances.</p>
      <p>Coroners have legal powers to compel public bodies to conduct internal inquiries and introduce changes to medical practice if they believe there is a risk of deaths.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the couple added: "We are horrified that an internal inquiry has not been done in the past three and a half years and that there is still is still a reluctance to perform an inquiry and change practices.</p>
      <p>"We hope that our daughter did not die in vain."</p>
      <p>Speaking after the hearing, the family's legal representative, Mehmood Duke, said communication between branches of the NHS had been poor.</p>
      <p>She said: "What has emerged is that communication between the specialities and between GPs and the hospitals remains a critical problem in the NHS.</p>
      <p>"All that the family can hope for now is that lessons have been learned and that future deaths can be prevented.</p>
      <p>"Here we had a 10-year-old girl who was sent down an adult pathway instead of a paediatric one.</p>
      <p>"This set off a chain of events which led to a number of missed opportunities to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Leicester’s Hospitals said: “Our thoughts remain with Rosie’s family.</p>
      <p>"We will now take some time to reflect on the verdict shared today and consider how best to share the learning internally.</p>
      <p>"We will not be making any further comment at this time.”</p>
