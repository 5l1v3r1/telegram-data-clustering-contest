      <h1>ISL: Injuries take a toll as Kerala, Odisha settle for goalless draw</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:34:20+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Arun-George-479253056.cms" target="_blank">Arun George</a></address>
      <p>KOCHI: Ghastly injuries marred the fourth round <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/indian-super-league">Indian Super League</a> meeting between Kerala Blasters and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Odisha">Odisha</a> FC that ended in a goalless draw at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jawaharlal-Nehru-Stadium">Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium</a> here on Friday.</p>
      <p>Both sides had a player each sent to the hospital following a horrific clash of heads in the first half and while Blasters managed to break their two-match losing streak, Odisha should feel relieved having kept their first clean sheet of the season.</p>
      <p>"It was a poor game of football," Gombau said post-match. "We came here to win ...but there were not many chances and it was a slow game," said the Odisha head coach sounding happy with the result.</p>
      <p>Eelco Schattorie meanwhile was frustrated at full-time. He claimed there was a curse on him, which was the cause of Blasters poor run of form. "But even if it's a point, i take it as a victory," said Schattorie.</p>
      <p>Inside the first half-an-hour, the Blasters were dealt a massive blow when a pair of starters got injured. JairoRodrigues limping off inside five minutes to what seemed like a hamstring pull, whilst adding to their defensive woes, still was not as frightful as Messi Bouli’s head injury that resulted in the Cameroon striker being taken away in an ambulance.</p>
      <p>The lanky forward, who earned his maiden start in place of club captain Bartholomew Ogbeche, had been a livewire in attack until the horrific incident when he flung himself in an attempt to make a clearance from a corner but collided head-on with Odisha hitman Aridane Santana, who himself suffered a cut and was also taken to the hospital.</p>
      <p>As cruel as it may sound, the incident that happened shortly after 20 minutes of play and which consumed a good 10 more before the restart was the most eventful spell on the football pitch in almost the entirety of the first half.</p>
      <p>Kerala held the ball for the most part though clear cut opportunities were few and far between. Their best moment came after the injuries when Sahal Abdul Samad waltzed into the Odisha box, sidestepping a pair of defenders before being tackled down. Kerala’s pleas for a penalty were, however, turned down and coach Eelco Schattorie was animated on the touchline. Schattorie seemed on the verge of a confrontation with the officials when a second appeal for a penalty, after the hour-mark, was turned down, when Prasanth's attempted cross hit Narayan Das’s flailing arm.</p>
      <p>KP Rahul would come close when he caught a delightful cross from substitute Mohammed Rafi mid-flight before skying it. For the visitors, Santana’s exit seemed to stem their main outlet and barring Xisco Hernandez’s attempts from long range, a pair of which failed to threaten Rehenesh in the Kerala goal, there was little Josep Gombau’s side offered.</p>
      <p>Kerala played with more purpose in the final quarter and Rahul was denied by a brilliant reflex save from Dorronsoro.</p>
