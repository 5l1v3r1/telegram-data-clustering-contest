      <p>The poll <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/sessions-announces-run-for-his-former-senate-seat/">first reported by Alabama Daily News</a> was conducted October 29-31 by WPA Intelligence and surveyed 511 GOP primary voters with a margin of error of +/-4.4%. It showed Session ahead of former Auburn head football coach Tommy Tuberville by 13 points followed by Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL), former Alabama Supreme Chief Justice Roy Moore, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and State Rep. Arnold Mooney (R).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jeff Sessions 36%</li>
        <li>Tommy Tuberville 23%</li>
        <li>Bradley Byrne 11%</li>
        <li>Roy Moore 11%</li>
        <li>John Merrill 6%</li>
        <li>Arnold Mooney 2%</li>
        <li>Undecided 12%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The poll also shows 71 percent of Republican primary voters have a favorable view of Sessions, whereas 20 percent viewed him unfavorably.</p>
      <p>In addition to serving in President Donald Trump’s cabinet, Sessions served Alabama in the U.S. Senate for two decades and served as Alabama’s attorney general after a stint in the Reagan Department of Justice.</p>
      <p>Alabama Republican voters will get cast a ballot on March 3, 2020 for their preference as to who will represent the GOP in the general election against likely Democratic nominee incumbent Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL).</p>
      <p>Jones, who will likely be considered to be an underdog in next November’s contest, defeated Roy Moore in a special election in 2017.</p>
