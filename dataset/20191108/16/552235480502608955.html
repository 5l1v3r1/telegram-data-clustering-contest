      <h1>Dean Smith in Alfredo Morelos Rangers confession as Aston Villa boss namechecks in-form striker</h1>
      <h2>The 23-year-old has scored 21 goals this season and Aston Villa are understood to be interested.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:09:20+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith has admitted he kept a close eye on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> as the striker downed Porto.</p>
      <p>The Colombian opened the scoring for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> with a stunning strike before setting up Steven Davis for the second.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> have been heavily linked with a move for Morelos and Smith concedes he had a watching brief of the striker's exploits.</p>
      <p>But he insists he won't speculate further on the 21-goal frontman.</p>

      <p>He said: "I certainly saw his goal last night.</p>
      <p>"It was a very good finish.</p>
      <p>"He's a player who is contracted to another football club and we aren't a club that talks about them."</p>
      <p>Morelos has also been linked with a move to Crystal Palace while the likes of Frankfurt are also believed to be keen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> insists he isn't going anywhere in the January window despite a rush of recent rumours.</p>
      <p>That's despite Rangers posting an Â£11m financial loss. Morelos has often spoken about his wish to move to the English Premier League.</p>
      <p>Gerrard had said: "I'm not confident, I'm sure, I'm 100 per cent sure he's not going anywhere."</p>
