      <p>Cape Town - There’s no doubt South Africa has some of the hottest exports right now – Trevor Noah, Charlize Theron and Nomzamo Mbatha are just some of the homegrown talents blowing up in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>And if her latest award is anything to go by, Bonang Matheba is adding her name to the long line of locals who are flying the flag high overseas. The popular presenter became the first winner of the African Influencer of the Year gong at the recent E! Entertainment People’s Choice Awards in America.</p>
      <p>It’s a few days after her big victory and she still can’t believe she beat rapper Cassper Nyovest, fellow TV presenter Minnie Dlamini Jones as well as Nigerian stars Davido, Wizkid and Tiwa Savage by public vote.</p>

      <p>“When you are up against the people in that category, you cannot help but feel honoured,” Bonang tells <b>DRUM</b>. “I was more than happy to be nominated. Some of these people have triple the following I have, which means my people had to do three times as much work for me to get the award.” Her fans, known as the BForce on social media, made a beeline for the voting site, bagging her the award.</p>

        <b>FROM SOWETO WITH LOVE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Born in 1987, Bonang Dorothy Matheba always wanted to be a star. In 2007 she launched her showbiz career as a Live Amp presenter. A year later, she branched into business when she started her Just B clothing range with Legit. Her career, she told <b>IOL</b>, is modelled on that of her mentor, American presenter and producer Ryan Seacrest. “Ryan is still the template. I’ve mimicked the way he has done things as a TV presenter and his business acumen.</p>

        <b>WHAT’S NEXT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bonang’s star is certainly shining brightly, and the world is her oyster. “I’m moving to the US after the Sun Met next year and the plan is to get there to put the plans in motion,” she has said. She’s blazed a trail in showbiz and shows no signs of slowing down. “I have a hunger to be great and it is addictive,” she says.</p>
      <p> “I work hard, I make sacrifices because I want to be the best. If I had the opportunity to speak to the young Bonang who got into the industry very young I would tell her to keep going."</p>
