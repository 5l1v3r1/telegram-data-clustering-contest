        <b>A noisy neighbour who blasted out dance anthem Born Slippy on a loop has been warned he could face jail if he fails to keep the noise down.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Clyde Taylor, 54, ignored official warnings to stop playing the Underworld track in the early hours.</p>
      <p>Hi-fi equipment, speakers and an electric guitar were seized from his home in Eccles after repeated breaches of a noise abatement notice.</p>
      <p>He was also ordered to pay a £1,500 fine, and a £30 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>A court order obtained by Salford Council prevents him from playing music or "permitting music to be played at a level that can be heard outside the property".</p>
      <p>The authority said the action could have been avoided had Mr Taylor obeyed the first "polite request to keep the noise down".</p>
      <p>Councillor David Lancaster said a little "neighbourly consideration" would have prevented action being taken.</p>
      <p>"If people refuse to be reasonable and considerate then we will use our full powers," he said.</p>

      <p>Mr Taylor did not attend court in October, and was found guilty in his absence of eight breaches of failing to comply with a noise abatement notice.</p>
      <p>The council said it was the first criminal behaviour order made in relation to noise pollution made in Greater Manchester.</p>
