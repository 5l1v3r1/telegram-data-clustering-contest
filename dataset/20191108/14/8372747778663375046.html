      <p>CAPTIVA, Fla. -- Lee County Mosquito Control is using sterilized male mosquitoes to help reduce the insect's population on Captiva Island.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.lcmcd.com/">mosquito control</a> , the male mosquitoes are grown in LCMCD labs using eggs from the local population, and are sterilized using X-rays and then released to mate with wild female mosquitoes.</p>
      <p>They say the females will be unable to produce viable eggs, decreasing the population.</p>
      <p>This initial round of releases will determine the flight range of male mosquitoes once released, which will aid LCMCD biologists in determining effective release points.</p>
      <p>The sterile mosquitoes are dusted with a fluorescent powder for identification purposes. They do not bite and may be noticed in flight as they search for the wild females.</p>
      <p>The District will target the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> population on Captiva and eventually continue releases in other areas of the county.</p>
