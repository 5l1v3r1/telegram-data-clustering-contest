      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-not-concerned-alienating-20818214">Nicola Sturgeon</a> has insisted the SNP has a "cast-iron" mandate to hold another independence vote, as she warned Boris Johnson has "no right to block the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland".</p>
      <p>Launching the party's General Election campaign at Dynamic Earth in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> , the First Minister said her intention remains to hold a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nicola-sturgeon-intends-hold-second-20822606">second referendum on independence next year</a> .</p>
      <p>She said: "The SNP already has a cast-iron mandate for an independence referendum, based on our explicit manifesto pledge for the 2016 Holyrood election.</p>
      <p>"The question must be to Boris Johnson and to Westminster: What gives you the right to block the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland?</p>
      <p>"That is an undemocratic, untenable and unsustainable position."</p>
      <p>She added that the Conservative Party has "ridden roughshod" over the Scottish Parliament.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Scotland's vote to remain in the EU has been ignored," she said.</p>
      <p>"For the first time ever, the UK Government has chosen to legislate on devolved matters without the consent of Holyrood.</p>
      <p>"With so-called 'moderate' Conservatives in full retreat and the hard-line Brexit ultras on the march, that is surely only a taste of what is to come."</p>
      <p>But she said a vote for the SNP on December 12 is a vote to put Scotland's future "firmly in Scotland's hands".</p>

      <p>She went on: "Westminster's priorities can be summed up in just three words - Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.</p>
      <p>"A vote for the SNP, in contrast, is a vote to escape Brexit. A vote for the SNP is a vote to take Scotland's future out of the hands of Boris Johnson and a broken Westminster system."</p>
      <p>The SNP earlier pledged to introduce a Bill to protect the NHS from any future trade deals with foreign nations, including the US.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon said: "We will fight tooth and nail any attempt to expose the national health service to a post-Brexit trade deal with Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>"That's why after the election, SNP MPs will bring forward a new law - an NHS protection Bill - to explicitly protect the NHS in all four countries of the UK from becoming a bargaining chip in future trade deals.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"It would prevent companies from taking legal action through investment protection or investor-state dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>
      <p>"It would ensure that confidential discounts for expensive medicines would not be at risk.</p>
      <p>"And it would stipulate that, before any trade deal could come into force, the Scottish Parliament and the other devolved legislatures would need to give their explicit content."</p>
