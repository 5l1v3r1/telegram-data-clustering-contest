        <b>A third Celtic fan has been stabbed and 12 Lazio supporters arrested following Thursday night's match in Rome.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The stab victim, thought to be a 20-year-old man, was treated in hospital for a back wound before being released.</p>
      <p>Several Celtic supporters were also attacked when a shuttle bus transporting them from the stadium broke down and was ambushed.</p>
      <p>Police arrested 12 people known to be members of the Lazio Ultras group in connection with the bus attack.</p>

      <p>Fireworks, bottles and other objects were thrown after the Europa League game, which Celtic won 2-1.</p>
      <p>It is understood those arrested belong to the most extreme element of the Lazio support.</p>
      <p>It is not thought that any Celtic fans sustained serious injuries after their bus was ambushed.</p>
      <p>In the lead up to the game, two Celtic fans were stabbed by masked men outside the Flann O'Brien pub in the city.</p>

      <p>Both were stabbed in the leg but their injuries are not life-threatening.</p>
      <p>One of the men, aged 52, is still in hospital but the other has been released. Police said an investigation was ongoing.</p>
      <p>Tensions were high after warnings that Lazio fans wanted revenge for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50239751">a controversial banner unfurled by Celtic fans</a> at a match in Glasgow last month.</p>
      <p>The banner showed the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini hanging upside down.</p>
