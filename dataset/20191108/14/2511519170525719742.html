      <h1>Liverpool vs Man City: Belief at Anfield has never been higher, claims Georginio Wijnaldum</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool have not lost a Premier League game so far this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:17:14+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Latham-Coyle</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/georginio-wijnaldum">Georginio Wijnaldum</a> thinks belief has never been higher at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool FC</a> as they prepare for their crucial meeting with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterCity">Manchester City</a>.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have not lost in the league this season and lead their rivals by six points at the top of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> table.</p>
      <p>Wijnaldum explained why they have managed to keep the unbeaten run going.</p>
      <p>We just create that thing that we know we always can turn things around,” the midfielder explained to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/11857016/georginio-wijnaldum-belief-in-liverpool-squad-has-never-been-higher"><i>Sky Sports</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“We always have that feeling, to stay positive. That’s also because of the results we had until now, and the way we came back.</p>
      <p>“Our mindset is different, which is quite good, because we keep doing the things we want to do in a game.</p>
      <p>“Normally if you are 2-0 down, your body language is going to change, but we still have that mindset that we can still turn it around.</p>
      <p>“It’s because of the belief we have in each other, but also the results we have had. We have (turned games around) a lot of times. That gives confidence.</p>
      <p>“If it just happened once, it’s not the same. But it happened over and over. We know we are a team that can always come back from difficult situations – but of course we don’t want to let it go that far.”</p>
      <p>City visit Anfield hoping to close the gap between the two sides, while a win for Liverpool would make a title for which they are already favourites look even more likely.</p>
      <p>While some have suggested that the physical and mental exertions will eventually take their toll, Wijnaldum is not worried that Liverpool could fade at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Dutchman thinks winning is the best remedy for fatigue.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard, really hard. You have to go until the end, and you have to go even when you don’t physically see a positive outcome,” Wijnaldum said.</p>
      <p>“Especially at the end of the games, you just keep going because you think you can.</p>
      <p>“Your body is tired and so you battle with your body like ‘No, we have to go, we have to go on’.</p>
      <p>“It’s really hard, but in the end you enjoy it more if you win that way than if it is easy.”</p>
