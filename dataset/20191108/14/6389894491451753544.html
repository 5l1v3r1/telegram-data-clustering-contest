      <h1>Mamas &amp; Papas to shutter stores in pre-pack administration deal</h1>

      <p>Maternity retailer Mamas &amp; Papas has called in administrators in order to shutter loss-making stores just days after the collapse of rival firm Mothercare. </p>
      <p>Bluegem Capital, the owner of Mamas &amp; Papas since 2014, has regained control through a pre-pack administration – an insolvency procedure – which has allowed the retailer to close six unprofitable stores.</p>

      <p>Mamas &amp; Papas branches in Aberdeen, Preston, Milton Keynes, Lincoln, Leamington and Fareham have closed and 73 employees have been made redundant.</p>
      <p>A further 54 jobs are at risk as the retailer reviews its head office operations in Huddersfield.</p>
      <p>Mamas &amp; Papas executive chairman Riccardo Cincotta said: “These actions are always difficult but they are also necessary in a challenging market to ensure Mamas &amp; Papas achieves its considerable future potential.”</p>
      <p>He added: “We will continue to review our store portfolio in the light of customers’ changing behaviour and we remain fully committed to an omni-channel offering that reflects their evolving needs.”</p>
      <p>Bluegem Capital managing partner Marco Capello said the pre-pack insolvency process had put Mamas &amp; Papas on a “solid platform”.</p>
      <p>The store closures and redundancies come as a further blow to the struggling UK high street, which has seen a string of high profile retailers collapse this year.</p>
      <p>More than 2,500 jobs are at risk after Mothercare’s UK business entered administration on Wednesday. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The administrator, PwC, announced it will implement a phased closure of Mothercare’s 79 UK stores after management decided that they were not profitable and no buyer could be found.</p>
      <p>Increasing competition from supermarkets and online retailers and a failure to invest in its own online operation were cited as factors in the maternity and baby retailer’s downfall.</p>
