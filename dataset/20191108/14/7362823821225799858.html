      <h1>Terry Bradshaw on Trump attending sporting events: Our political environment is 'ugly'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:26:27+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Musto</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/presspass/bios/on-air/terry-bradshaw">Fox Sports NFL analyst Terry Bradshaw</a> said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> decision to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-attend-lsu-alabama-game-reports">attend a pivotal college football matchup</a> between the University of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/alabama-crimson-tide">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers">LSU</a> this weekend is "a pretty incredible thing."</p>
      <p>Trump is making preparations to attend the game between the two SEC rivals, <a href="https://www.si.com/college/alabama/bamacentral/alabama-football-lsu-president-trump/">Sports Illustrated</a> reported Monday. It is one of the most anticipated matchups of the season and a game that will include the two top-ranked teams in the Associated Press top 25 poll.</p>
      <p>Trump was on the field for the 2018 national championship game between the Crimson Tide and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/georgia-bulldogs">Georgia Bulldogs</a>. He stayed for the first half before leaving the game.</p>
      <p>The president has been making the rounds at several sporting events over the last week or so. Trump was at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/kurt-suzuki-nationals-maga-hat-fox-friends">Game 5 of the World Series</a> in Washington D.C. and he was at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-cheered-and-booed-at-ufc-match-in-new-york-city">UFC 244 in New York City</a>. In both instances, Trump received a smattering of cheers and boos from the crowd.</p>

      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Fox &amp; Friends,"</a> the Hall of Fame NFL quarterback said he has his "[hat] off" to President Trump "having the guts to go in there," lamenting the fans who choose to boo the commander-in-chief.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I've noticed in our political environment today and maybe it started a few years ago -- it's really right, it's really left, and it's really angry, and it's ugly, and it's hostile," he told the "Friends" hosts.</p>
      <p>"I've never seen it like that in this country."</p>
      <p>Alabama head coach Nick Saban said it was an "honor" that the president would be "interested enough to come to the game."</p>
      <p>"I'm sure we'll do everything we can to welcome him," he <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/11/07/nick-saban-honored-to-have-president-trump-attending-lsu-game/">told the Montgomery Adviser</a>.</p>

      <p>However, LSU coach Ed Orgeron <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/sports/lsu/article_01c11baa-00b3-11ea-ba98-4f499a922004.html">told the same publication</a> that he hopes that the president will "sit right there in the middle" and cheer for both sides.</p>

      <p>Regardless, Bradshaw predicts victory for the Tigers.</p>
      <p>"As a matter of fact," he said, "I had a dream. Get this: I had a dream that for whatever reason -- I didn't go to LSU -- LSU won that football game. Hey, isn't that the best?"</p>
      <p>The pivotal SEC game is set for a 3:30 p.m. ET start at Bryant-Denny Stadium.</p>
