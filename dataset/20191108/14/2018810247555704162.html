      <p>It's been a while since we've drawn some games. Let's get back into the groove, shall we?</p>
      <p>This game isn't something you might recognise immediately â€” although if you've played it, you <i>will</i> know what it is because it has a super distinctive art style. But to help you along, it's from a game that's been in the news this week. (Local news, not US news.)</p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
