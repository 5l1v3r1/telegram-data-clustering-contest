      <p>You know what would go really well with a long, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/20/20875856/fire-emblem-three-houses-time-skip-blue-lions-dimitri-nintendo-switch">grueling story about war and trauma</a>? New outfits and ways to blow off steam, clearly.</p>
      <p>The latest wave of DLC for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/7/25/8930095/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch"><i>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</i></a> has hit today, and the patch brings with it a bevy of new content. There are new threads for all students, including the obligatory maid and butler costumes that will make cutscenes hilarious. (Maids and butlers are now a type of recruitable battalion, too.) There’s now a sauna mechanic as well, which allows you to soak in the heat with your classmates.</p>

      <p>And, fan favorite Anna the Merchant is back as a recruitable character now, along with the moody Jeritza (but only on the Black Eagles route.) Anna doesn’t have any support conversations, unfortunately, but she does come with a paralogue story mission.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most important addition in wave 3 is the ability to spend time with the many animals roaming around the monastery. You can now interact with the dogs and cats by giving them gifts. Yay!</p>
