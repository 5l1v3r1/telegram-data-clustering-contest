      <h1>How to disable the persistent battery icon that appears in YouTube on Pixel 4</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:35:24+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Some early Pixel 4 owners have noticed that the battery icon in the status bar shows even when viewing YouTube videos in full-screen. It can be pretty annoying, but luckily there’s an easy solution to the problem.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear <i>why</i>, but on the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/google-pixel-4-review/">Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</a> the battery icon will show when you’re watching YouTube videos where, on other Android phones, it disappears alongside the rest of the status bar. One might assume this is a bug, but it might be intentional since the icon is “dimmed” to make it less obtrusive.</p>
      <p>The issue was first <a href="https://twitter.com/ArtemR/status/1192305558319067137">highlighted on Twitter</a> and saw several replies mentioning the same issue on other Pixel 4 devices.</p>
      <p>There are a couple of quick troubleshooting fixes that can solve this problem. In my case, the status bar was never fully going away in <i>any</i> apps. For whatever reason, turning off developer options fixed the issue on my device and it has not come back since.</p>
      <p>For most people that only have the battery icon, though, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/08/pixel-4-youtube-battery-icon-motion-sense/"><i>Android Police</i></a> noticed that there’s a correlation between the battery icon and the Pixel 4’s Motion Sense feature. When the “Skip Songs” functionality is turned off, the icon disappears.</p>
