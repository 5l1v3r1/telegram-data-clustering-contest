      <p>In October, within days of President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US military from north-eastern Syria, Turkey launched an operation against Kurdish forces, which Ankara designates as terrorists, and the Daesh* terrorist group in the area.</p>
      <p>On 17 October, however, Vice President Mike Pence reached a deal with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan on a five-day ceasefire. As the ceasefire came to an end, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russia's Vladimir Putin reached a separate deal to pull the Kurdish fighters and their weapons out from the 18-mile safe zone within 150 hours and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911021077206490-watch-russian-military-police-and-turkish-troops-first-patrol-of-syrian-turkish-border/">establish joint patrols in the operation area</a> along the Turkish border.</p>
