      <h1>Man adorably proposes in KFC and offers flood in to fund their dream wedding</h1>
      <h2>The couple's KFC engagement has led to promises of a free honeymoon and celebrity performances at their wedding</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:29:16+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A man's sweet proposal in KFC led to a country-wide campaign to track down the couple and suggestions their 'national wedding' should be broadcast on television.</p>
      <p>When Bhut’ Hector got down on one knee in front of his partner in South Africa with their meal still warm on the table, he not only attracted the attention of everyone else in the fast food chain, but more than 1.3 million people online.</p>
      <p>The video showing him beaming as he offers the ring to his partner Nonhlanhla, who struggles to hold back the tears, was filmed by witnesses and shared on the official KFC South Africa <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account with an appeal to identify the newly-engaged pair.</p>
      <p>It didn't take long for them to be pointed out and KFC have told their swarm of loyal fans online to stay tuned as they prepare to reveal the surprise they have in store for their #streetwisewedding.</p>

      <p>The chain may find themselves a little late to the party, as the success of the video online has seen celebrities, companies and ordinary people pledging their services to ensure their big day is one the whole country will remember.</p>
      <p>There's a battle on to host their honeymoon, with airline Kulula offering a fully complimentary holiday in Cape Town including flights and five nights accommodation, and Limpopo Tourism also offering to host their celebration free of charge.</p>
      <p>Popular DJ Black Coffee let Bhut’ know he will take care of the suits for himself and his groomsman, and musician Zakes Bantwini is one of many wanting to appear, tweeting: "I want to offer my performance at the wedding for free. I love love!"</p>

      <p>A small wedding planning service offered their expertise to sort the flowers and decor, and with plenty of others offering to help, the show of love all got a little bit too much for some.</p>
      <p>"I’m literally in tears. Congratulations. I want to attend this wedding. It’s a must," sobbed one.</p>
      <p>"Love wins! National wedding this!" another wrote.</p>
      <p>A third replied: "When South Africans unite... this is too good, congratulations to the blessed couple."</p>
      <p>With many tweeting South African TV stations asking them to broadcast the nuptials, it may not be the last time Bhut’ Hector and Nonhlanhla steal our hearts.</p>
