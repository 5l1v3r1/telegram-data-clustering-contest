      <h2>Liverpool and Manchester City face off at Anfield this weekend with Jurgen Klopp's men looking to go nine points clear</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:15:08+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror Football, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mirror-football/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool can go nine points clear of title rivals Liverpool when they meet at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's men have won 10 of their 11 Premier League matches this season and haven't been beaten since losing to City last season.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's men went on to win the title but Liverpool are in pole position to claim their maiden Premier League title this term.</p>
      <p>City haven't won at Anfield since 2003 and Riyad Mahrez missed a late penalty in the goalless draw last season.</p>
      <p>City's cause has not been helped with goalkeeper Ederson missing the encounter with an injury.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the clash, Mirror Sport reporters - and a special celebrity fan - were asked for their predictions.</p>

      <p>In early October, I watched Raul Jimenez, Adama Traore and Patrick Cutrone terrorise <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> ’s defence.</p>
      <p>The personnel at the back for City this Sunday will be slightly different and they have tightened up a touch recently but if that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> trio can get joy against Pep Guardiola’s team, it is hard to imagine anything other than success for Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p>Whatever defensive permutation Guardiola uses, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> will score - and score more than once.</p>
      <p>Do not expect a repeat of last season’s goalless draw. Do expect a convincing Liverpool win.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Anfield is a graveyard for Manchester City - just two wins in 63 years and none since 2003 - and the injuries that Pep Guardiola has been forced to contend with has made the task of the champions even more difficult.</p>
      <p>Liverpool had an opportunity to close off the title race when the teams last met, at the Etihad in January - and ran into a City team that produced their most impressive performance of the season to give themselves hope.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's side will never get a better chance than this and I expect them to take it.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Manchester City haven’t won at Anfield since 2003 and I can’t seem them ending that run on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Much will depend on whether a key trio for City - Ederson, David Silva and Rodri - are fit. It’s hard enough going to Liverpool with a fully-fit squad and getting a result, let alone with key personnel missing. City could cope without Silva and Rodri, although Pep Guardiola would rather have both available.</p>
      <p>But with Ederson out, you fear for City with the liability that is Claudio Bravo between the posts. Defensively, City are vulnerable, without the injured Aymeric Laporte and with ageing midfielder Fernandinho and the inconsistent John Stones likely to start in central defence.</p>
      <p>Taking all those factors into account, it all points to a comfortable Liverpool win and a commanding nine-point lead in the title race.</p>

      <p>Make sure the creosote is dry, check for splinters and sit on the fence.</p>
      <p>It's unlikely to be goalless, which was the outcome at Anfield last season thanks to Riyad Mahrez sending his late penalty into outer space.</p>
      <p>And for two such accomplished teams, way out ahead of the rest of the Premier League, a shortage of clean sheets has been a surprising problem for both Jugen Klopp and Pep Guardiola of late.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are unbeaten in 17 meetings with City at Anfield, going back to 2003, and if Pep is going to close that gap at the top, now would be a good time to break the hoodoo.</p>
      <p>But it's hard to back against Liverpool's front three, who often rise to the big occasion in front of the Kop.</p>
      <p>Now, where's that fence? Are we sitting comfortably?</p>

      <p>Liverpool seem to be destined to win the Premier League finally this term in my view.</p>
      <p>They have an irresistible momentum after their latest dramatic comeback last weekend at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>With boss Jurgen Klopp driving them on, especially at home, they look awesome.</p>
      <p>City will come under huge pressure at Anfield and I don't think they have the defensive quality to cope.</p>

      <p>If results go as many expect them to on Saturday then this game will kick off as a narrative-destroying contest between first and fourth, and it is impossible to downplay the psychological blow on the champions that Liverpool would inflict with a win.</p>
      <p>I expect a tense, edgy contest similar to the goalless draw at Anfield last season, when Riyad Mahrez blazed over a late penalty in a game featuring tactics unlike anything we've seen from Pep Guardiola before.</p>
      <p>He'll look to contain Liverpool again, but the Reds, emboldened by their experiences last season, have found more and more ways to win games in this campaign.</p>
      <p>If they can edge this with a late goal it really would be lift-off for the title dream.</p>

        <b>Liverpool 2-1 Man City</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool haven't lost at home in the Premier League in two and a half years, and while City would be the most likely contenders to break that streak, this isn’t the right time.</p>
      <p>Aymeric Laporte is proving a huge absence for City and they’ve kept just two clean sheets in their last seven games.</p>
      <p>I’d expect Guardiola to be quite cautious and pragmatic at Anfield, rather than attempting to fight fire with fire.</p>
      <p>But, when the dust settles, I think Liverpool will edge it, with one member of their front trio having the final, decisive say.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It feels like people are foolishly writing off Manchester City heading into this game.</p>
      <p>People are getting caught up on City's defensive issues, but why has nobody focused on Liverpool's?</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has failed to see his team pick up a clean sheet in eight games. There are leaks in the back line and City's attack is the fiercest they will have come up against this season.</p>

      <p>Yes, City have defensive problems of their own and there is no doubt that Liverpool will likely find a way through.</p>
      <p>But this game feels more like a must-win for City than Liverpool - and Pep Guardiola's side tend to deliver under pressure.</p>
      <p>There will be goals, but for me, City prove their quality and ensure the title race is back on.</p>

      <p>It’s a big game to be fair, a massive game in the league, but I think the form Liverpool are in means they will win.</p>
      <p>Manchester City have been in good form too, but they haven’t been invincible like Liverpool, they’ve had a few slip-ups. You’ve got to fancy Liverpool to go and do it on Sunday, especially with it being at Anfield.</p>
      <p>As long as Liverpool don’t lose, it will be a good result for them because they already have a six-point lead.</p>
      <p>Both teams have shown they can score and both teams have shown vulnerabilities, which is a bit surprising from a Liverpool point of view because they had been so strong at the back last season.</p>
      <p>I think Liverpool will have too much for City and I’m backing them to come away with the three points.</p>
