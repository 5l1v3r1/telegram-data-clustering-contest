      <h3>The funniest standup I’ve ever seen …</h3>
      <p>I must have watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttRIz-0HWps">Dylan Moran’s DVD of Monster</a>, recorded at Vicar Street in Dublin, about a hundred times. It’s storytelling, almost character standup but the gag rate is higher than most one-liner comedians. Oh, if you haven’t seen it just watch it, it’s bliss.</p>
      <h3>The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen …</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JibxHpXqAfc">Cake Factory from Big Train</a>. It’s a very simple and tight idea and lovely writing but the thing that makes it are the performances from Simon Pegg and Rebecca Front.</p>
      <h3>The funniest dream I’ve ever had …</h3>
      <p>I have very boring dreams. I once dreamed I was making toast for ages. I woke up and was both bored and annoyed that I still had to make the toast.</p>
      <h3>The funniest person I know …</h3>
      <p>My friend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mike-bartlett">Mike Bartlett</a> – who I went to school with and who has since written some of the best dramas on TV and in the theatre – makes me laugh probably more than anyone else.</p>
      <h3>The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had …</h3>
      <p>I don’t understand how a hairstyle is funny. Does that mean something you regret? Or are embarrassed by? I don’t care how I look very much so all my haircuts are both wonderful and hilarious.</p>
      <h3>The funniest joke I’ve ever heard …</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/11/colin-hoult-funniest-things">Colin Hoult</a>’s alter ego Andy Parker had the quip: “Never apologise, never explain. [Beat] Sorry, I got that from a book.”</p>
