I took the characters animation alembics from her Maya scenes and made it better-than-pixar-eyecandy short :)<br/><br/>Only two naked animated character meshes came from Maya via alembic. I did mapping, texturing, grooming, shading and replaced the eyes with my own realistic. Did all the environment, simulation, render, soundFX and compositing in Blender.<br/><br/>Notice that the dog gets wet when jumps into the water and leaves footprints when gets out. That's all done with dynamic paint - awesome tool!<br/><br/>The sounds were partialy taken from <a href="https://youtu.be/Q2wT6ZpCmyo">the original school video</a>Â  and from freesound.org.<br/>Enjoy!</blockquote>
