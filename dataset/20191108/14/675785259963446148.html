      <h1>Ellie Gould murder: Schoolboy's chilling texts to explain injuries after killing ex</h1>
      <h2>Thomas Griffiths, 17, killed Ellie Gould in her home in Wiltshire - then told a friend that neck scratches he suffered as the schoolgirl fought for her life were actually self-harm injuries</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:01:55+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A schoolboy who brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend tried to cover his tracks in messages sent to friends while she lay in a pool of her own blood.</p>
      <p>This morning Thomas Griffiths was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-ellie-gould-murder-boy-20839740">sentenced to life in prison for the murder</a> of Ellie Gould at her family home in Calne, Wiltshire, on May 3.</p>
      <p>After the brutal attack the then 17-year-old placed her hand on the knife to make it look like suicide.</p>
      <p>He then went back to his school and began weaving a web of lies in a bid to cover his murderous tracks.</p>
      <p>In one message he sent that afternoon, Griffiths claimed scratches Ellie had made to his neck as she fought for her life were in fact self-harm wounds.</p>

      <p>"I know me and Ellie are going on a break but I've been so anxious and nervous about everything lately and I don't know who else to talk to x," he wrote.</p>
      <p>"I've also not told anyone this but I've been kind of hurting myself by scratching my neck quite hard x."</p>
      <p>The unnamed friend who was quick to send sympathy and described Griffiths as "such a lovely person".</p>

      <p>Around the same time that the two friends were communicating, Ellie's dad Matthew walked into his home to find his daughter dead on the floor.</p>
      <p>In a victim personal statement read out at Bristol Crown Court this morning, Mr Gould said: "The image of Ellie lying there on the floor has haunted me ever since that afternoon.</p>
      <p>"It fills my thoughts when trying to sleep and hijacks my mind when trying to go about my day."</p>
      <p>Griffiths made a second attempt to cover his tracks online hen he posted a selfie overlaid with text.</p>

      <p>"I've been so stressed lately and I don't know how to cope with it," he wrote.</p>
      <p>"I've been scratching myself around my neck area and as this group has kind of become my best friends I don't know who else to talk to x.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to see Ms Todd (the school matron) now and explain everything that's been happening x."</p>
      <p>Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, explained how Griffiths had actually come to suffer the scratches.</p>

      <p>"In truth, the injuries to the defendant's neck and to his hand were nothing to do with self-infliction but very much more likely the product of his young victim having fought for her life as she was attacked," he said.</p>
      <p>Griffiths efforts to distance himself from the brutal killing - which included sending texts to his dead ex-girlfriend's phone - were unsuccesful.</p>
      <p>Three hours after Ellie's dad discovered her dead Griffiths was arrested outside his friend's home.</p>
      <p>He "lied repeatedly" to police about what had happened, professing his innocence for three weeks.</p>

      <p>Griffiths changed his plea to guilty before the start of the trial and was ordered to serve at least 12 years and six months behind bars today.</p>
      <p>Sasha Wass QC, representing Griffiths, told the court how he had been under exam pressure and the emotional strain that came with his father's diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
      <p>She said the teenager had been in a "state of denial" after the murder.</p>
      <p>"Tom, rather than acting as a master criminal, simply wanted to behave as if nothing has happened," she said.</p>

      <p>"Within three weeks he accepted what he had done.</p>
      <p>"Both families have been devastated by what Thomas Griffiths did. No-one bears that burden more than Tom does."</p>
      <p>Ms Wass read a letter written to the court by Griffiths, in which he apologised for his actions.</p>
      <p>"Ever since that dreadful day, I have tried to come to terms with what I have done," Griffiths wrote.</p>
      <p>"All I feel is remorse for Ellie and her family after I took such a special daughter and sister away from them.</p>

      <p>"I feel confused and angry at myself at how I was able to hurt someone so special to me and others.</p>
      <p>"At the time, my mental health was not good and I wish I had recognised this.</p>
      <p>"As well as this, I would like to apologise to my family who are truly devastated by my actions and what happened.</p>
      <p>"I have truly let myself down and I hope one day I will be able to explain to myself and others why this happened.</p>
      <p>"I'm so sorry. I know my apologies and explanations will never be enough but I hope in time I can show how truly sorry I am."</p>
      <p>As Griffith's letter was read to the court, Ellie's mother stared at him and shook her head.</p>
      <p>His parents, who were sat near the dock, wept through the proceedings, as did their son.</p>
