      <h1>Ross McCrorie injury blow as Rangers loanee faces Portsmouth setback</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox youngster has been sidelined with a hamstring injury he suffered last weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:44:16+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:44</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers youngster <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-mccrorie">Ross McCrorie</a> will be out for between four to six weeks after the Portsmouth loanee suffered a hamstring problem against Oxford United.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox defender, on loan at Fratton Park, put in a man-of-the-match performance at right-back but his standout display was blighted by picking up the injury towards the end of the game.</p>
      <p>And Pompey boss Kenny Jackett revealed the issue will keep him on the sidelines until December.</p>
      <p>He said: "McCrorie will be out for four to six weeks – and so it will be, by the looks of it, December for him."</p>

      <p>McCrorie's time at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/portsmouth-fc">Portsmouth</a> has been a mixed bag with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-u21s-football-team">Scotland-21</a> star in and out of the first team.</p>
      <p>But he started to show his potential in recent weeks and seemed like he was going to kick on for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>This comes as a blow for McCrorie who left Ibrox in the summer in the search for regular first team action.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> have the option to recall the 21-year-old in January and it remains to be seen if the injury will have any impact on the club's decision.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Jackett said following the Oxford game he was delighted with McCrorie's performance and his progress in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>He added: "He brought a lot to our game and is learning all the time. In terms of bookings, he has to be careful and learn from that – and he can and will keep improving.</p>

      <p>‘He has found his feet now, there have been quite a number of changes in the summer and he is one of them. I am pleased with him.</p>
      <p>‘We persevered with him and there is a player there, definitely."</p>
