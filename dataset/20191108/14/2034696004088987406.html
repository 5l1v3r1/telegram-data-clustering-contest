      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/lizzo">Lizzo</a> has opened up about her mental health and revealed that she suffers from anxiety.</p>
      <p>The singer said she often suffers with the condition before she goes on stage but she uses it to “fuel” her performance.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/lizzo-british-vogue-interview">Vogue</a> magazine: “When I get really, really anxious before a show, I just go harder and harder and harder when I’m performing and I just go crazy.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know why, but my anxiety sometimes fuels who I am as a performer and who I am as an artist – and I know that is not the case for everyone. I don’t know if my body just, like, out of a desperate need to find a place for my anxiety or find a use for it, takes it and puts it there.”</p>
      <p>Lizzo also said she worried about her physical appearance growing up. “I would watch things on television and I would look at magazines and I would not see myself,” she said.</p>

      <p>“When you don’t see yourself, you start to start to think something’s wrong with you. Then you want to look like those things and when you start to realise it’s a physical impossibility, you start to think, “What the fuck is wrong with me?”</p>
      <p>She added: “I think that took a greater toll on me – psychologically – growing up than what anyone could have said to me.”</p>
      <p>It was recently revealed that the singer once auditioned <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/lizzo-auditioned-for-the-glee-project-2562037">for a place on <i>The Glee Project</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Kevin McHale, who played Artie Abrams on the teen drama series made the admission and said she didn’t make the final cut — a decision he called “fucked up.”</p>
      <p>Last night (November 7) Lizzo performed at the O2 Brixton Academy. NME described gave her four stars and <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/lizzo-live-london-positivity-politics-baked-potatoes-2019s-magnetic-star">described the show</a> as “gnarly electric guitar riffs toying around her usual arrangements while smoke billows at Lizzo’s feet and wind blows through her hair that she never fails to toss for our pleasure”. </p>
