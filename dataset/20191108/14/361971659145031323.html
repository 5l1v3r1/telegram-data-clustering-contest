      <h2>After a brief detainment for buying cocaine, he was arrested for assault while celebrating his release</h2>

      <p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/27708-peter-doherty/">Pete Doherty</a> has been arrested twice in the space of three days. The <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/2471-the-libertines/">Libertines</a> frontman was initially detained Thursday night in Paris, when police stopped him during an alleged cocaine purchase, <a href="https://apnews.com/b504dd1ea2ed49bcb38e921f0118f284">Associated Press reports</a>.</p>
      <p>He was held until Saturday and, in return for his release, provisionally agreed to pay daily fines of 50 euros (about $55) for 100 days, failing which he would be jailed, according to <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191110-british-rocker-pete-doherty-arrested-again-in-paris">AFP</a>. His second arrest was made on Sunday, when he went out to celebrate, became intoxicated, and brawled with a man who has now pressed assault charges, Doherty’s lawyer Arash Derambarsh said.</p>
      <p>After rising to fame in the early 2000s, Doherty became a news fixture for crimes relating to drug use and his subsequent struggles with addiction, though no drug arrests have been reported for several years. The Libertines are due to tour Europe later this month.</p>
