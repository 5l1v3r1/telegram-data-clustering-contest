      <p>NFS: Heat is - if you can believe it - the 24th game in the franchise which only recently had its 25th anniversary. </p>
      <h3>Where to buy Need for Speed: Heat</h3>
      <p>It's available on Xbox and PS4, and you can buy it from the respective stores on those consoles. If you want to play it on PC, you can get <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/need-for-speed-heat-deluxe-edition/bw67x0s8qskk">NFS Heat Deluxe from the Microsoft Store</a>. Instead, you can <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777289-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fgame%2Fwhere-buy-how-pre-download-nfs-heat-3777289%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ea.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgames%2Fneed-for-speed%2Fneed-for-speed-heat%2Fbuy">buy NFS: Heat from EA on Origin</a>. (You can also get the Xbox and PS4 versions on the same link.)</p>
      <p>There are two editions: Standard and Deluxe. Standard costs £54.99 / $59.99.</p>
      <p>Deluxe is £59.99 / $69.99 and you get the Evo X plus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>BMW i8</li>
        <li>Mercedes C63 AMG</li>
        <li>Chevrolet Corvetter Grand Sport</li>
        <li>4 exclusive outfits </li>
        <li>5% more Bank and Rep from each event.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can get a 10 percent discount if you pre-order from in game in Need for Speed Payback (the previous game).</p>
      <p>An alternative to buying the game outright is to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777289-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fgame%2Fwhere-buy-how-pre-download-nfs-heat-3777289%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.origin.com%2Fgbr%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Forigin-access">subscribe to Origin Access</a>, which costs £3.99 / $4.99 per month. As mentioned, if you go for the Premier tier of the subscription, you get early access to games, but it costs £14.99 / $14.99 per month.</p>
      <p>That's all for the digital version of NFS: Heat. But, of course, you can buy a physical copy for Xbox or PS4, but not for PC.</p>

      <h3>How to pre-load Need for Speed: Heat</h3>
      <p>If you want to be able to play the game the second it is released, you need to pre-order it, and pre-load it. </p>
      <p>Those with an <b>Xbox One</b> can pre-order immediately, and the game should start downloading straight away.</p>
      <p>The same applies for <b>PC</b>: pre-load has started already for NFS: Heat on Windows 10.</p>
      <p><b>PS4</b> preloads tend to begin two days before the official launch date, which means you should be able to pre-load from 6 November.</p>

      <h3>Need for Speed Heat Studio app</h3>
      <p>EA has released an app for Android and iOS which lets you customise base cars ahead of the game's full launch on 8 November.</p>
      <p>Called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777289-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fgame%2Fwhere-buy-how-pre-download-nfs-heat-3777289%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ea.com%2Fgames%2Fneed-for-speed%2Fneed-for-speed-heat%2Fnfs-heat-studio">NFS Heat Studio</a>, you can modify cars and when you unlock them in the actual game you can then quickly apply the mods you've made in the app.</p>
      <p>Plus, you can use AR mode to place your creations in the real world, take photos and share them on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.</p>
