      <h1>Kurds hurl rocks at Russian-Turkish Syria patrol</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:33:39+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>MAABDA, SYRIA: </b>Kurdish protesters hurled rocks Friday at Turkish military vehicles in northeastern Syria during a patrol in which one civilian died when he was run over by a personnel carrier.</p>
      <p>A small group of people pelted the convoy with rocks and shoes as it drove by near the town of Maabda, close to the Turkish border.</p>
      <p>A young man was run over by one of the large armoured vehicles and rushed to hospital in the town of Derik.</p>
      <p>“He died there of internal bleeding,” the monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</p>
      <p>Kurdish villagers have given a similar tough welcome to joint Russian-Turkish patrols in other locations.</p>
      <p>Turkish forces and their proxies – former Syrian rebels hired as a ground force by Ankara – launched a deadly offensive against Kurdish forces in Syria on October 9.</p>
      <p>The push was aimed at seizing a roughly 30-kilometre (20-mile) deep strip of land along the entire 440-kilometre border between the two countries.</p>
      <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants to keep Syria’s Kurdish militia – which has organic ties to Turkey’s own Kurdish insurgency – at bay.</p>
      <p>Another declared goal is to create what Turkey is calling a “safe zone” in which to resettle some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it hosts on its soil.</p>
      <p>The invasion has displaced tens of thousands and left dozens of civilians dead, forcing Kurdish forces to retreat from some key towns.</p>
      <p>A US military withdrawal announced days earlier had left their Kurdish partners in the lurch and made the Turkish offensive possible.</p>
      <p>A deal reached later last month in the Black Sea resort of Sochi between Russia and Turkey demanded that Kurdish forces pull back from the 30-kilometre buffer zone and let regime forces back in.</p>
      <p>It also says a thinner 10-kilometre strip beyond which Turkish forces cannot venture would be patrolled jointly by Russia and Turkey.</p>
      <p>The deal has reduced the violence but sporadic fighting continues in several areas along the border.</p>
