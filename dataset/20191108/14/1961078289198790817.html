        <i>Good morning.</i>
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>It’s Friday, and if you’re in California, that may mean unwinding with a glass of wine, or, increasingly, a little green.</p>
      <p>I’m talking about weed. And yes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/marijuana-legalization.html?module=inline">almost exactly three years</a> after Californians voted to legalize marijuana, it still feels slightly edgy to talk about cannabis consumption as openly as drinking in the pages of The New York Times.</p>
      <p>Recently, that’s what I did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/style/weed-cafe-los-angeles-lowell-marijuana.html?module=inline">in a piece</a> for The Times’s Styles desk, about West Hollywood’s first weed consumption lounge, a restaurant named Lowell Farms: A Cannabis Cafe, and the state of California’s weed economy.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Lowell Farms is the first of what will be <a href="https://www.weho.org/home/showdocument?id=39873">16 consumption lounges in the city</a>, which leaders say they hope will become a kind of cannabis destination — and will reap the economic benefits — while its bigger and slower moving counterparts, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-03/cannabis-licenses-los-angeles">like Los Angeles</a>, continue to grapple with how to fairly distribute coveted pot shop licenses.</p>
      <p>Investors and entrepreneurs are jostling for pieces of what experts have said is a vast and growing legal cannabis market.</p>
      <p>The chief executive of Lowell Herb Co., the fast-growing business behind the restaurant, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/style/weed-cafe-los-angeles-lowell-marijuana.html?module=inline">told me</a> that Lowell Farms is just one way of building a recognizable brand as the company seeks to scoop up loyal consumers in what is now a wide open field.</p>
      <p>While there is no weed in Lowell Farms’s food, the menu was designed to pair nicely with cannabis.</p>
      <p>And to help new diners figure out what goes with what, the restaurant has roving “flower hosts,” or weed sommeliers of sorts.</p>
      <p>The idea of applying a sommelier’s nuanced palate to cannabis <a href="https://www.eater.com/2016/9/16/12930854/how-to-become-a-weed-sommelier">isn’t new</a>. But <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/10/19/being-marijuana-sommelier-now-thing/2TLI6KIdRKRCnaC5QPlvgM/story.html">interest is growing</a> along with legal marijuana markets.</p>
      <p>While reporting on Lowell Farms, I talked with Bianca Blanche, one of the restaurant’s first flower hosts and a writer for the <a href="https://www.lowellfarms.com/blog">brand’s website</a>, about how she approaches the job.</p>
      <p>Ms. Blanche said she moved to California from New York, where she’d worked in a bridal store, about four years ago.</p>
      <p>“What sparked that change was I had developed my own relationship with cannabis,” she told me. “Nothing sounded better than moving out to Los Angeles and selling weed.”</p>
      <p>She got a job at a medical dispensary, where Ms. Blanche said she got a hands-on education in how different products and strains worked.</p>

      <p>She also learned that “budtenders” like her typically earn between $10 and $15 an hour and aren’t often tipped, despite the fact that the job entails a broad range of customer interactions.</p>
      <p>Like bartenders, budtenders are on their feet for long periods of time and connect with customers on a more personal level than many other retail workers. But they also often end up playing the role of a therapist or nurse.</p>
      <p>“You have to be able to recommend a product to potentially solve whatever health issue they’re experiencing,” Ms. Blanche said. “I know things about my patients that I don’t think even their closest friends or families do.”</p>
      <p>When she started preparing to work as a flower host at Lowell Farms, she said, she studied up on terpenes, the organic compounds that produce the distinct aromas of various marijuana strains.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Some have piney or lemony terpenes, which she said can be paired similarly to a white wine, with fish or chicken.</p>
      <p>Others are a little more “earthy and herby,” she said, like rosemary or cloves. Those compliment richer dishes, like steaks.</p>
      <p>Mostly, she said it’s important to understand your individual experience level and tolerance.</p>
      <p>“Honest and open dialogue is definitely No. 1,” Ms. Blanche said.</p>

      <h3>And Finally …</h3>
      <p>If legal substances are not your style, please consider kicking off your weekend with two very important animal tales from the week.</p>
      <p>The first comes to us from Ventura County, where firefighters rescued a great horned owl, who was “hopping around in the ashes” of a eucalyptus grove during the Maria fire. The owl, <a href="https://twitter.com/VCFD/status/1191414485870735361">later named “Ram,”</a> after the football team, was taken to the nonprofit Camarillo Wildlife Rehabilitation, which the group said saved its life, according to <a href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/politics/elections/santa-paula/2019/11/04/firefighters-rescue-owl-maria-fire/4151825002/">The Ventura County Star</a>.</p>
      <p>The second is a story about Sweets, a miniature horse who was spotted riding BART through the Transbay Tube on Tuesday. Her fellow BART riders were left murmuring, “Who is she?” Their only recourse: A hashtag, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bartpony&amp;src=typed_query">#BARTpony</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11785505/for-the-bart-pony-riding-on-train-was-work-not-play">KQED investigated</a>, and as it turns out, Sweets was just hard at work like the rest of us. She lives in the Solano County hills and is training to be a service animal.</p>
