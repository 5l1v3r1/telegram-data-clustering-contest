      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ederson">Ederson</a>, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterCity">Manchester City</a> goalkeeper, has been ruled out of Sunday’s crucial top-of-the-table clash with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> through injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pep_Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> confirmed on Friday that the 26-year-old will not recover from a thigh problem in time to start at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Ederson suffered the injury during the first half of Wednesday’s 1-1 draw with Atalanta and was replaced at the break by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/claudio-bravo">Claudio Bravo</a>.</p>
      <p>Bravo was later sent off for a late challenge on Josip Ilicic, forcing full-back Kyle Walker to deputise in goal, but the Chilean will nevertheless start against Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“[Ederson] is not able to play,” Guardiola confirmed. “[Claudio] Bravo can do it.</p>
      <p>“We won the Carabao Cup with him. He’s an exceptional ‘keeper, a lot of games with his national team Chile.”</p>
      <p>Bravo has not played a Premier League game for City since the final day of the 2017-18 season, when a late win at Southampton ensured Guardiola’s side would finish with 100 points.</p>
      <p>The former Barcelona goalkeeper struggled to adapt to English football during his first year at City and was eventually replaced by Ederson during the summer of 2017.</p>
      <p>Guardiola launched a robust defence of Bravo, however, insisting that he trusts his backup goalkeeper will not let him down on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Why should I not be confident with my players in my team? I would not like to be a player and my manager doubt me,” he said. ”I saw him every day in the training session, how he fights and how good he is.</p>
      <p>“The red card is because we lost a ball in a dangerous position. You have to respect this guy. He won the Copa America. Respect that guy. He’s an incredible top, top ‘keeper.</p>
      <p>“First season, it was because the team was not at a top level and not good. Sometimes you make a good save, sometimes not. </p>
      <p>“All the players are in our squad because we have incredible confidence in them. We need the whole squad.”</p>
