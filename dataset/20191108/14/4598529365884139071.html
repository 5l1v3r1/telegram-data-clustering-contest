      <p>The whistleblower’s lawyer sent the White House a cease and desist letter Thursday, warning that the President’s constant stream of vitriol is putting his client in “physical danger.”</p>
      <p>“I am writing to respectfully request that you counsel your client on the legal and ethical peril in which he is placing himself should anyone be physically harmed as a result of his, or his surrogates’, behavior,” attorney Andrew Bakaj wrote to White House counsel Pat Cipollone in a letter <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/07/politics/ukraine-whistleblower-trump-cease-and-desist/index.html">obtained by CNN.</a></p>
      <p>Trump and other Republicans have been hammering the whistleblower lately, trying to distract from more damaging impeachment inquiry narratives by insisting that he has duplicitous reasons for keeping his identity a secret.</p>
      <p>For Democrats, the whistleblower has been steadily losing relevance to their probe, as other witnesses with fewer concerns about being identified have corroborated the original complaint.</p>
