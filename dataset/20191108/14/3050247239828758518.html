      <h1>VeChain Unveils Food Tracing Solution Foodgates at China’s Import Expo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:12:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:12</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/singapore">Singapore</a>-based <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a> application platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/vechain">VeChain</a> has unveiled a new blockchain tracking system for the food and beverage industry.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/vechain-foundation/vechain-together-with-asi-group-and-dnv-gl-announced-the-first-cross-continental-logistics-and-e2e65a0d562">blog post</a> on Nov. 7, the company confirmed it was working with food certification group DNV GL and supply chain specialist ASI Group on the project, known as Foodgates.</p>
      <h3>VeChain “direct beneficiary” of pro-blockchain stance</h3>
      <p>The original announcement came at this year’s China International Import Expo (CIIE), being held from 5-10 Nov. in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>“The immutability of public blockchain coupled with verifiable information makes this solution really unique,” VeChain COO Kevin Feng commented.</p>
      <p>VeChain revealed Foodgates had already been put to work, importing French beef to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china">China</a> for an event attended by French president Emmanuel Macron and China’s Xi Jinping, who also spoke at CIIE.</p>
      <h3>China given a blockchain go ahead</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-will-china-pursue-xi-jinpings-blockchain-adoption-plan">reported</a>, China recently unleashed huge official support of blockchain technology, with Xi himself urging its use in a speech in late October.</p>
      <p>The surprising development accompanied news that China could become the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-to-be-first-to-launch-digital-currency-says-think-tank-exec">first country</a> in the world to release its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Following Xi’s words, local media began <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-warns-against-cryptocurrency-speculation-amid-blockchain-hype">warning</a> citizens about the legal implications of criticizing blockchain or calling the technology a scam.</p>
      <p>“VeChain, being a global blockchain technology platform provider with significant resources in China and Europe will be a direct beneficiary of this bullish shift by the second largest economy in the world,” the blog post added.</p>
      <h3>Blockchain no magic bean for food industry</h3>
      <p>Blockchain has made significant inroads into the food industry in recent years. Businesses have devoted energy to tracking everything from <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/medici-backed-blockchain-firm-wants-to-unite-the-coffee-industry-of-honduras">coffee</a> to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-food-retailer-albertsons-uses-ibm-food-trust-blockchain-to-track-lettuce">lettuce</a>, arguing immutable ledgers save time, money and add security to supply chains. Nonetheless, criticism has come from experts who have identified shortcomings in potential new systems.</p>
      <p>“The weakest link in the chain is not blockchain or any technology, the weakest link is the piece of sticky tape that puts the label on the package,” PwC analyst <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pwc-analyst-blockchain-gives-illusion-of-traceability-for-walmart">explained</a> in an interview on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Additionally, VeChain’s announcement saw instant benefits for investors in its native VET token, which rose around 40% this week after an initial dip.</p>
