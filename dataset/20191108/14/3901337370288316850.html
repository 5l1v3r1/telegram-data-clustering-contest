      <h1>Pitso: Were Chiefs The Only Ones Who Won?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:36:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says although they are a little behind with their points tally to attempt to retain the Absa Premiership title, the Brazilians are still on course for the championship race. </p>
      <p>Mosimane watched as his men dropped points away to Baroka FC on Wednesday night in Polokwane following a goalless draw, while log leaders Kaizer Chiefs beat Chippa United 2-0 to open up a seven-point gap at the top. </p>

      <p>“I can say two points dropped, but if I look at the performance… we did not deserve the three points to be honest. I think the point was fair. We did not create those easy chances to be able to win,” Mosimane told reporters. </p>
      <p>Asked about the gap being opened up by Amakhosi, the Downs coach suggested that they were running their own race.</p>
      <p>“But we were playing Baroka, why are you bringing up Chiefs? Were they the only team that won? Good luck to them. We are just two points behind our programme and we have to follow that process, the outcome will sort itself out,” Mosimane, whose side still has a game in hand, explained.</p>
