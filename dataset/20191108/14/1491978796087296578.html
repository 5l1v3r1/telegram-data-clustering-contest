        <i>Someone’s immaculate home set me off on a rant, until I worked out why I was so rattled</i>
      </p>
      <p>Recently, I tagged along to a property viewing where the estate agent announced that despite the listed price, the owners were looking for £600,000.</p>
      <p>Six. Hundred. Thousand. Pounds.</p>
      <p>“Shall we leave?” I whispered to my friend.</p>
      <p>“No,” she replied. “Let’s snoop.”</p>
      <p>Usually, I love looking at houses. My faves are the ones with character, chock-full of knick-knacks that tell a story. This house was different – immaculately designed in hues of walnut. Everything was curated just so: reclaimed floorboards, period doors, a butler sink and antique furniture that looked inherited. I figured the owners were wealthy.</p>
      <p>I was strangely rattled. “They had a whole shelf dedicated to grains in kilner jars,” I ranted later, “all smugly labelled – spelt, barley – and they grew grapes in their conservatory.”</p>
      <p>“Thought you liked grapes?” said my rational friend, Steve.</p>
      <p>“Not the point, it’s... oh, shut up, Steve!”</p>
      <p>It’s true: I love grapes. I also think organising your grains is sensible. But I interpreted these details as assertions of power. I pictured the owners writing letters to MPs at their Edwardian bureau, eating foie gras naked but for one of those colonial-era leopard rugs. The next day I took to Google. “Why am I such a bitch?” The answer? Unresolved stress. It makes sense: a few weeks earlier, my own attempt to move fell through, thwarted by ruthless landlords, in a city run by landlords, in a country of haves and have-nots.</p>
      <p>The reason we snipe is that we’re frustrated. I’m glad to have learned this. But I also learned that sniping is letting off steam; it helps you to cope and it is harmless if fleeting. Hey, maybe it can even be fun. I certainly laughed, picturing it: “Dear right honorable sir, please forgive my naked ambition…”</p>
