On November 7, she posted her thoughts about the controversy on Twitter. She wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"Competition programs are predetermined from the start, and I don't think 'Produce 101' was different. When we first heard '<b>Pick Me</b>', some of the trainees were already well-aware of the song and the choreography. I was originally not going to say anything about the possible manipulation, but I had a really hard time after 'Produce 101' aired. I would like everyone to know the majority of the trainees are like me and are not at fault."</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>She then deleted the tweet and followed up with an apology, saying, <i>"I apologize for the wording of my previous post that led to misunderstandings. I was only talking about the producers and staff and wanted to say the trainees had no part in this."<br/><br/></i>As previously reported, head <b>CJ ENM</b> producer <b>Ahn Joon Young</b> <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/video/2019/11/cj-enm-producer-ahn-joon-young-admits-to-manipulating-votes-for-produce-x-101-produce-48">admitted to</a> manipulating votes for 'Produce x 101' and '<b>Produce 48</b>'.</p>
