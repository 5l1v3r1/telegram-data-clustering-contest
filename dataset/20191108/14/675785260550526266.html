      <h1>Bullied kids to be taught how to fight better for free in new classes</h1>
      <h2>Free self-defence classes are being offered to children across the country ahead of Anti-Bullying Week, but learning how to knock someone over is far from the only benefit to signing up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:23:11+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Learning martial arts has a lot more benefits than just getting better at fighting - but we can't deny that's part of the draw.</p>
      <p>So, as part of Anti-Bullying Week 2019 (Monday 11 – Friday 15 November), <a href="http://childcare.co.uk/">Childcare.co.uk</a> has teamed up with the <a href="https://www.jitsufoundation.org/">Jiu Jitsu Foundation</a> to offer its members free junior self-defence classes.</p>
      <p>Childcare.co.uk founder Richard Conway said: “ We’re very excited to announce our partnership with The Jiu Jitsu Foundation for a second year – last year’s campaign was a huge success, so it’s fantastic to be able to offer even more free spaces to our members this year.</p>
      <p>"We hope that by offering these classes, hundreds more children across the UK will have the chance to build their confidence and learn something new!”</p>

      <p>On top of the direct self-defence benefits, martial arts classes can help young children build self-confidence, develop leadership skills, make friends and become more active.</p>
      <p>Gareth Horgan from the Jiu Jitsu Foundation, said: “Our aim is to bring consistently high-quality Jiu Jitsu to as many people as possible across the globe.</p>
      <p>"In doing so our Junior arm seek to provide life changing skills and experience for children, young adults and their families."</p>
      <p>Children will not only learn jiu jitsu skills and situational awareness, they will also be encouraged to respect each other and develop their confidence.</p>
      <p>The first 1,000 members of Childcare.co.uk to register their interest will get a full month of free classes for their child.</p>
      <p>You can register <a href="http://www.childcare.co.uk/bullying">your interest in the classes here</a> .</p>
