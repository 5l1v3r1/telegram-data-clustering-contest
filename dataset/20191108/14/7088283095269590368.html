        <b>Media reports say without previous notification, President Buhari terminated the tenures of 35 senior staff assigned to Vice President Osinbajo's office</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to<a href="http://punchng.com/osinbajo-practically-out-of-buharis-govt-afenifere/"> Punch,</a> Nigerian Vice-President Osinbajo had more aides than President Buhari.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://dailynigerian.com/see-list-of-osinbajos-35-aides-reportedly-sacked-by-buhari/">Daily Nigerian</a> website claims he had 80 senior staff as opposed to 25 for Buhari, before Wednesday’s sackings and redeployments at the Aso Rock Presidential Palace.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/361299-buhari-has-not-relegated-osinbajo-presidential-aide.html">Premium Times</a>, for its part, claimed that most of the officials who were handed termination letters on Wednesday were appointed during the 130 non-consecutive days in 2017 when Buhari was undergoing medical treatment in London.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="http://tribuneonlineng.com/just-in-identity-of-sacked-osinbajos-aides-revealed/">Nigerian Tribune </a>reports that some of the senior special assistants , personal assistants and technical assistants affected by the retrenchments were issued their appointment letters only in August, 2019.</p>
      <p>The controversy over the sackings comes as the Nigerian leader Muhammadu Buhari remains abroad on a 20-day visit that took him to the Saudi-Africa summit and then to the United Kingdom where he is due to remain until November 17.</p>
      <p>He left Abuja without handing over the reins of power to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as he did in previous occasions, as required by the constitution.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian Tribune notes in its coverage of the layoffs at Aso Rock Presidential Villa, that all has not been well between Buhari and Osinbajo since their inauguration for a second term on May 29, 2019.</p>
      <p>“Our constitution doesn’t give much powers to the Vice President and many of the staff of his office are actually recruited by the President”, says Obadiah Mailafiya a former deputy Governor of Nigeria’s Central Bank and candidate of African Democratic Congress in the 2019 presidential elections.</p>
      <p>According to The Economist, from 2015 up to May this year, the responsibilities of heading the economic management team were delegated to Osinbajo by Buhari.</p>

      <p>Mailafiya believes that Buhari’s recent signing-in London of a bill that amended the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract was a clear message to the Vice President.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/361299-buhari-has-not-relegated-osinbajo-presidential-aide.html">Premium Times</a> reports that it was Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, who flew to London to <b><a href="http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/360954-breaking-buhari-signs-law-that-will-significantly-increase-nigerias-oil-earnings.html">submit a new bill on offshore oil fields</a></b> for his assent.</p>
      <p>“They started off extremely well, but it seems as if that trust has deteriorated”, the banker turned politician explains.</p>

      <p>Obadiah Mailafiya’s views reflect a strongly-worded statement issued on Tuesday by the Afenifere, the umbrella Yorub socio-cultural group to which Yemi Osinbajo belongs.</p>
      <p>The Vice-President “has been made redundant as if he is no longer a relevant member of Buhari’s government”, complained Afenifere spokesman, Yinka Odumakin, in an interview with <a href="http://punchng.com/osinbajo-practically-out-of-buharis-govt-afenifere"><i>The Punch</i></a>.</p>
