      <p>CATALIST-LISTED Vividthree Holdings will be the exclusive provider of immersive technology, gamification and IT production for the HeurêkaLand Project, a tourism integrated development in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The company on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER) and exhibition promoter Science Discoveries Sdn Bhd.</p>
      <p>The HeurêkaLand Project is a 45-acre, or 18.2-hectare, futuristic integrated development in Putrajaya, Malaysia, worth about RM1.3 billion (S$427.5 million).</p>
      <p>The mixed project will house immersive, interactive gamification and attractions in five thematic zones: exhibition, hotel, education, commercial and entertainment. It will feature six museums, indoor and outdoor theme parks, an aquarium, a 100-metre Knowledge Beacon Tower and more.</p>
