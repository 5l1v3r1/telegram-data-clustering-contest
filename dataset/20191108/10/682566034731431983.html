      <p>Cape Town - <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> received an injury boost ahead of the Soweto derby on Saturday with the news that <b>Reeve Frosler</b> and <b>Kearyn Baccus</b> will be fit and ready for the big game.</p>
      <p>Defender Frosler and midfielder Baccus missed last week's Telkom Knockout clash against Orlando Pirates and the midweek league victory over Chippa United.</p>
      <p>Chiefs head coach Ernst Middendorp said after the win against the Chilli Boys that both players should be fit for the clash against Pirates that takes place at the FNB Stadium.</p>
      <p>The German mentor also gave an update on some of the other players that were rested on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Middendorp said: "In the moment I would say I got feedback and Yagan Sasman needed three days more, so did Khama Billiat, Lebogang Manyama and Eric Mathoho.</p>
      <p>"As it looks, Reeve and Kearyn, definitely yes they will be available on Saturday as per information I got.</p>
      <p>"And we will have to see which team we get on Saturday."</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 15:30.</p>
