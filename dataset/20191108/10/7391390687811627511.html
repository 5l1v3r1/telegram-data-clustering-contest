      <p>A <a href="https://vossevents.com/events/drag-race-uk/">description of the upcoming tour</a> promises to bring "the most sickening talent contest in the world" to a city near you, and give fans the chance to witness "all of the charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent" of our UK queens live. The tour will be hosted by <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> legend, Alyssa Edwards, who previously appeared on two seasons of the U.S. version of the show.</p>
      <p>As <i>Attitude </i>reports, <a href="https://www.attitude.co.uk/article/drag-race-uks-frock-destroyers-score-shows-first-top-10-hit-with-break-up-bye-bye-1/22187/">the current batch of UK queens</a> recently made <i>Drag Race</i> herstory after scoring UK Top 10 hit. Yes, fan-favourites Baga Chipz, Divina de Campo and Blu Hydrangea — better known as The Frock Destroyers — performed their way to victory in the show's recent girlband-themed challenge, and their MNEK-produced track "Break Up (Bye Bye)" entered The Official Big Top 40 chart at number 10. The fabulous trio are also set to debut in the Top 20 of the Official UK Singles Chart, which means the <i>Drag Race</i> stars<i> could</i> be looking forward to yet more chart success. Fingers crossed.</p>
