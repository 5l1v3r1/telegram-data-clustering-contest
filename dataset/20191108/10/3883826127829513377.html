        <b>England produced one of their best ever Twenty20 batting performances in Friday's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/50342584">76-run win over New Zealand,</a> says captain Eoin Morgan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tourists made 241-3 - their highest T20 score - with Dawid Malan making an unbeaten 103 from 51 balls, the fastest century by an England batsman in the shortest format.</p>
      <p>"I don't think we've ever batted in that manner or posted a score like that, so to do it against a very strong line-up and come out winners is extremely satisfying," said Morgan.</p>
      <p>England set several national records in Napier, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Fastest T20I half-century </b>(Morgan, 21 balls)</li>
        <li><b>Fastest T20I century</b> (Malan, 48 balls)</li>
        <li><b>Highest T20I total </b>(241-3)</li>
        <li><b>Highest T20I partnership </b>(182 runs, Malan and Morgan)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Malan and Morgan teamed up with England 58-2 off 7.2 overs and were parted 182 runs and 74 balls later.</p>
      <p>Morgan made 91 off 41 balls in an innings which contained seven fours and seven sixes.</p>
      <p>It means England have levelled the five-match series at 2-2 with one game remaining, having rested a number of senior players for the tour.</p>
      <p>"I said before the game that our method doesn't really waver at any stage, just our skill level needs to get better," Morgan told Test Match Special.</p>
      <p>"Today it was right on the money, particularly with the bat. In T20 cricket you have to continue to take risks."</p>
      <p>The final match takes place in Auckland on Sunday at 01:00 GMT.</p>
      <p>There, Malan will be hoping to continue a run of form which has seen him become the first player to register more than four 50+ scores in his first 10 T20Is.</p>
      <p>He now averages 57.25 in his nine matches to date and is only the second England batsman to make a T20 century after Alex Hales in 2014.</p>
      <p>"To become the next in line or establish yourself in this team, you have to do something special," Yorkshire's Malan, 32, said.</p>
      <p>"For me to do this, hopefully I've put a step forward or half a step forward to proving I can actually play at this level in this format and I can push players above me.</p>
      <p>"You work so hard to get to this level: you have to score a lot of domestic runs and put in a lot of hours and sacrifices, so to be able to do it on the international stage and score runs, it's a relief when you finally reach a landmark.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know whether I should scream or just be calm but I have a way that I celebrate and I just stuck to it."</p>
