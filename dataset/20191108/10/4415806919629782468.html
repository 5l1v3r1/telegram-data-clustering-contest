      <p>Scientists have invented a way to create fake rhino horn using horse hair – hoping it will provide a blueprint for flooding the market with credible fakes.</p>
      <p>Rhino horn is believed to have many benefits in Chinese medicine, including working as an aphrodisiac.</p>
      <p>However, researchers say the reality is that sellers are often cutting the horn with drugs such as Viagra.</p>
      <p>They add that regardless of the blend, the demand for rhino horn continues to drive poaching, with devastating effects for wild populations.</p>
      <p>The study, published in Scientific Reports, aims to provide a way to confuse, and in turn diminish, the demand for real rhino horns.</p>

      <p>According to the scientists from the University of Oxford and Fudan University, Shanghai, this will be done by demonstrating a way to a vastly cheaper copy that can be used to infiltrate the market.</p>
      <p>Co-lead author Professor Fritz Vollrath, from the University of Oxford’s Department of Zoology, said: “It appears from our investigation that it is rather easy as well as cheap to make a bio-inspired hornlike material that mimics the rhino’s extravagantly expensive tuft of nose hair.</p>
      <p>“We leave it to others to develop this technology further with the aim to confuse the trade, depress prices and thus support rhino conservation.”</p>
      <p>In the proof of concept, the scientists bundled together tail hairs of the rhino’s near relative, the horse, and glued them together with a matrix of regenerated silk to mimic the collagenous component of the real horn.</p>
      <p>This allowed them to fabricate sample structures that were confusingly similar to real rhino horn in look, feel and properties.</p>
      <p>Analytical studies demonstrated similarities in composition and properties between natural and faux horns.</p>
      <blockquote>Our study demonstrates that materials science can contribute to fundamental issues in biology and conservation</blockquote>
      <p>According to the researchers, it is important that plausible copies should be simple to produce while being very similar in both structure and chemical composition.</p>
      <p>Co-author Ruixin Mi, from the Department of Macromolecular Science at Fudan University, said: “Our study demonstrates that materials science can contribute to fundamental issues in biology and conservation.</p>
      <p>“The fundamental structure of the rhino horn is a highly evolved and tough fibre reinforced bio-composite and we hope that our attempts to copy it will not only undermine the trade in rhino horn but might also find uses as a novel bio-inspired material.”</p>
