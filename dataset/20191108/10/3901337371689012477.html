      <p>The view must be nice from up on top of the Absa Premiership table, but Kaizer Chiefs’ Ernst Middendorp has insisted that he’s not paying too much attention to their placement…</p>

      </p>
      <p>Chiefs are currently seven points clear of second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns going into this weekend’s Soweto Derby clash with Orlando Pirates, and find themselves 12 points ahead of their bitter rivals who are in seventh.</p>
      <p>The Glamour Boys can’t get too comfortable though, knowing that Bidvest Wits have four games in hand following their progression in the CAF Confederation Cup, and Middendorp is fully aware that they need to keep focusing on the next game in order to maintain their position at the summit.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chiefs’ official website, the German said, “I want to repeat and emphasise that I don’t look at the log that much. I’m not really interested in the log positions. We focus on the game and try to find the right balance always. Other teams have games in hand and you’ll never know what will happen. I’m glad we are collecting points at this stage.”</p>
      <p>Middendorp won’t have to look at the log for the next month anyway given their lead, the upcoming international break and Telkom Knockout semifinals, with no team able to overtake them for at least a few weeks.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Chiefs haven’t beaten Pirates in a league game for five years now, but – given their form – will feel like this weekend is the perfect time to change that.  </p>
