      <p>Today sees the launch of <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/laytons_mystery_journey_katrielle_and_the_millionaires_conspiracy_-_deluxe_edition">Layton’s Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires’ Conspiracy – Deluxe Edition</a></b> on Nintendo Switch, making it the first time that the Layton series has appeared on our favourite hybrid console.</p>
      <p>You can catch the launch trailer for the game up above; the game brings Layton's popular puzzle-solving to the big screen, with tradition button controls and motion controls available to players as they crack each case. You may remember that this game actually originally appeared on <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/laytons_mystery_journey_katrielle_and_the_millionaires_conspiracy">Nintendo 3DS</a>; this new Switch 'Deluxe' edition includes enhanced visuals and redesigned puzzles catered specifically for the console.</p>
      <p>We think this latest entry is a pretty strong puzzle game that's definitely worth looking into, even if it doesn't quite live up to the heights of the best from the series. We'll leave a snippet of our review below, but make sure to <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/laytons_mystery_journey_katrielle_and_the_millionaires_conspiracy_-_deluxe_edition">check out our full thoughts</a> before you go ahead and buy the game.</p>
      <blockquote>Layton’s Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires’ Conspiracy – Deluxe Edition proves itself to be a strong puzzle game in its own right, although compared to the highs of its predecessors, it doesn’t nearly hold up as well. Even so, the pleasant visuals, wonderful writing, and (mostly) strong puzzle design make this an easy sell, even if the occasional missteps in some of the puzzle answers and the lack of compelling new features for this re-release prove to be drawbacks.</blockquote>
      <p>The game is available both digitally from the Switch eShop and physically in stores. Will you be grabbing Layton’s Mystery Journey on Switch? Tell us below.</p>
