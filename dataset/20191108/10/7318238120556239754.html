      <p>Romanians go to the polls on Sunday to choose a new president amid great political instability.</p>
      <p>Just before this election, the brand new Government of Prime Minister Ludovic Orban survived a confidence vote. However, uncertainty looks set to continue.</p>
      <p>Among the political fights, the figure of the current president Klaus Iohannis stands out.</p>
      <p>Polls give him around 45% of the vote.</p>
      <p>Ioannis started his political career in 1990, but it was not until 2009 that he appeared on the national politics. In 2014 he was elected president.</p>
      <p>He is one of the main supporters of the strategic alliance with the US, and for many Romanians, he symbolises a different kind of politics.</p>
      <p>If there is a second round of voting, three candidates could challenge Ioannis.</p>
      <p>One is actor Mircea Diaconu, running as an independent and trying to attract a more traditional electorate. The most recent polls have predicted him a 15% share of the votes.</p>
      <p>According to the Romanian press, the biggest challenger to Ioannis is former Prime Minister Viorica Dancila, supported by the Social Democratic Party - or PSD. Though traditionally a political powerhouse, the PSD’s popularity has slumped in recent years.</p>
      <p>That would not be a problem for Dan Barna, third or fourth in the polls, as his supporter base overlaps Ioannis - both address mainly the anti-PSD electorate.</p>
