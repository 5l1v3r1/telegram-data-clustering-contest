      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:07:42+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:07</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Joleon Lescott says he will be supporting Wolverhampton Wanderers when Aston Villa head to Molineux on Sunday (2pm).</p>
      <p>Lescott came through the ranks at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> , spending six years with the club before being bought by Everton.</p>
      <p>He then went on to Manchester City, winning two Premier League titles, a pair of FA Cup trophies and a League cup.</p>
      <p>In the latter years of his career he had stints at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> , with his one season at Villa Park ending in relegation - the first time the club had been demoted from the top flight.</p>

      <p>Now a pundit, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/joleon-lescott">Lescott</a> revealed on Sunday that he will be supporting Wolves this weekend, not Villa who he grew up supporting.</p>
      <p>He was on duty for BT Sport's coverage <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-player-ratings-slovan-bratislava-17221528">of Wolves' 1-0 win over Slovan Bratislava</a> in the Europa League last night when Paul Ince questioned where his allegiances lie.</p>
      <p>"I will be supporting Wolves at the weekend," he said.</p>
      <p>"I was a Villa fan but not any more."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, his comments drew plenty of reaction from both sets of fans.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's the pick of the chatter on social media...</i>
      </p>
      <h4>Villa fans</h4>
      <p>@<b>tomlxnee</b>: Man saying not anymore like he cared about the club anyway</p>
