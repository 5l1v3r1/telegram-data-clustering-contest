      <h1>Unai Emery told to drop "shocking" Arsenal star Matteo Guendouzi for Leicester clash</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners go to the King Power Stadium on Saturday evening in what is being seen as a huge game for both their top four ambitions and Unai Emery's job prospects</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:38:54+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Matteo Guendouzi is getting away with poor Arsenal performances because of the recent focus on Granit Xhaka, according to former Gunners star Charlie Nicholas.</p>
      <p>The Scot - who played for Arsenal between 1983 and 1987 - has called for Unai Emery to drop the 20-year-old for Saturday's trip to Leicester, calling for a big change in the Gunners midfield.</p>
      <p>"Matteo Guendouzi is having a shocker and he is getting away with it due to Xhaka – he needs to be taken out of the team," Nicholas told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12090/11856399/charlie-nicholas-premier-league-predictions-liverpool-vs-man-city-leicester-vs-arsenal-and-more">Sky Sports</a> .</p>
      <p>"I would rather Unai Emery go with Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Lucas Torreira.</p>
      <p>"This is his (Torreira's) normal position, so let them be the legs in front of you."</p>

      <p>Nicholas added that Mesut Ozil and Nicolas Pepe should also be picked by Emery, who will be without the injured Dani Ceballos for the game, which he is predicting Leicester to win 3-2.</p>
      <p>"Mesut Ozil played well (against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> ) so he should stay in the side ahead of Dani Ceballos, while bringing Nicolas Pepe in for the counter-attack," he added.</p>
      <p>"I am not feeling good about this one.</p>

      <p>"It is a very good <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> team at the moment. Brendan Rodgers has earned the praise. Jamie Vardy’s goalscoring level has returned and James Maddison has been great, not to mention everybody else playing their part.</p>
      <p>"This Leicester side are much better to watch than the title-winning side.</p>
      <p>"They have pace, balance and are technically very good – you can get at them defensively in my mind but they are a decent force with pace and movement in the attacking half.</p>

      <p>" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> do not know how to handle that and cannot defend. Leicester have too much of this for my liking."</p>
      <p>The clash kicks off at 5.30pm GMT on Saturday.</p>
