      <p>Earlier this week, British teen Jarvis Kaye hit the headlines, after he was permanently banned from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fortnite">Fortnite</a> for cheating.</p>
      <p>The teen, known as FaZe Jarvis, broadcast a video of him using ‘aimbots’ - a tactic that is banned on Fortnite - to his two million <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/youtube">YouTube</a> subscribers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/video-games">Epic Games</a> , the developer behind Fortnite, immediately banned Jarvis from the game, sparking a fierce debate of whether cheating should result in a permanent ban.</p>
      <p>Jarvis is part of a group called FaZe Clan, who live together in a huge £11.2 million mansion in the Hollywood Hills.</p>
      <p>Now, his teammates have called on Epic Games to come up with a ‘fair compromise’, rather than banning Jarvis entirely.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/faze-clan-calls-compromise-jarvis-fortnite-ban-speaks-devastating-situation-11063102/">metro.co.uk</a> , FaZe Clan said: “FaZe Clan is a strong advocate for the rules and regulations of our industry.</p>
      <p>“Jarvis is an entertainer and content creator who streams and makes YouTube videos for his fans.</p>
      <p>“He’s doesn’t play professionally. He’s a 17-year-old individual who made a poor decision while creating content and even warns several times during the video to never use the aimbot technology.</p>

      <p>“He continues to reflect on the repercussions of his actions and the serious error in judgment. FaZe Clan continues to support Jarvis in all areas of his career and believes unequivocally that he is a well-intentioned young man and his actions though clearly wrong were not malicious in intent.</p>
      <p>“FaZe Clan is deeply saddened by the devastating impact this had had on Jarvis’s life.</p>
      <p>“But we remain hopeful and stand ready to work with Epic Games in any way possible to come up with opportunity that allows Jarvis to play again at some point in his life.</p>
      <p>“Given Jarvis’ young age and his all-consuming passion and love for Fortnite, we believe a fair compromise can be reached.”</p>
      <p>Despite FaZe Clan’s pleas, it seems that Epic Games is sticking to its decision to permanently ban Jarvis.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/10296007/fortnite-faze-jarvis-house-hollywood-la-video/">The Sun</a> , Epic Games said: “We have a zero tolerance policy for the usage of cheat software.</p>
      <p>"When people use aimbots or other cheat technologies to gain an unfair advantage, they ruin games for people who are playing fairly."</p>
