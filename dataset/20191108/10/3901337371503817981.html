      <p>The Blaugrana's search for a new No. 9 goes on as the club seeks to bring in a striker one day worthy of replacing the Uruguayan forward.</p>
      <p>As per <i>Sport</i>, Barca have set their sights on 17-year-old Karim Adeyemi, a young attacker who was born in Germany but is eligible to play for Nigeria through his family's African roots.</p>

      <p>Adeyemi is currently on loan from Red Bull Salzburg at FC Liefering in the second division of Austrian football, where he has spent the past two years.</p>
      <p>The Munich-born forward has scored 11 goals and assisted a further eight strikes in 30 senior appearances for Liefering, a very healthy return for a player who only turns 18 next year.</p>
