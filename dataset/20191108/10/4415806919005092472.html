      <p>Olivia Colman says she has no memory of the night she scooped an Oscar.</p>
      <p>The star, 45, won the best actress Academy Award for her role in comedy costume drama drama The Favourite.</p>
      <p>She tells The Graham Norton Show: “I actually can’t remember it. The great thing about the Oscars is there is a bar just behind (the auditorium) so everyone is there… almost everybody is in the bar getting bladdered!”</p>
      <p>Colman has since filmed her role as the Queen in Netflix drama The Crown.</p>

      <p>She previously told how she met the Duke Of Cambridge at a dinner and the royal told her he did not watch the period drama.</p>
      <p>“His answer was a firm, ‘No.’ But he was very charming and very lovely,” she has now told chat show host Norton.</p>
      <p>Helena Bonham Carter revealed more about her encounter with a psychic before she took on the role of Princess Margaret in the Netflix drama.</p>
      <p>“I hadn’t actually said yes (to the part) yet, but thought I’d ask her if I should take the role and she said: ‘You’ll be better than the other one.’</p>

      <p>“There was actually someone else up for the part and it was typical of Margaret,” Bonham Carter said.</p>
      <p>“I’d met her a few times and you never really knew where you were with her, she had a way of complimenting and putting you down at the same time.”</p>
      <p>The BBC One show also features actors Chadwick Boseman and Richard Ayoade, Lady Glenconner and Niall Horan.</p>
