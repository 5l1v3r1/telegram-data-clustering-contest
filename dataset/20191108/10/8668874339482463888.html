      <h1>A bizarre reason has emerged as to why Leone Nakarawa has yet to report for duty at Racing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:11:17+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Racing 92 have claimed they are still unsure about Leone Nakarawa’s absence – even though Pacific Rugby Welfare have insisted he is finishing building a house in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/fiji">Fiji</a> with the club’s blessing and his agent has been in communication with the Parisians.</p>
      <p>The coveted second row was part of the Fijian side eliminated from the World Cup when beaten by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> on October 9, but he has failed to report back for club duty with the Parisians.</p>
      <p>Nakarawa played in all four of his country’s pool matches at the finals in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> and was seemingly expected to pitch up in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> for training in the last week of October. However, there <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/leone-nakarawa-is-potentially-facing-the-sack-at-racing-92">has been no sign yet of a player</a> regarded to be one of the best in the world in his position.</p>
      <p>Despite a Pacific Rugby Welfare tweet insisting the club knows what Nakarawa is up to, the situation has not gone down well with his boss Laurent Travers following a stuttering start to the Top 14 season that sees Racing struggling near the foot of the table ahead of Sunday’s Parisian derby with Stade Francais.</p>
      <p>“He must resume,” <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Rugby/Actualites/Top-14-le-racing-92-attend-toujours-leone-nakarawa/1077917">said a perplexed Travers to L’Equipe</a> at Racing’s pre-derby match media conference. “We have news, yes, the players have had. I think the club too but now, for the moment he is not present at Racing 92. We do not know more.”</p>

      <p>Team-mate <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92/players/camille-chat/">Camille Chat</a>, who was part of the French squad whose World Cup campaign lasted longer as they reached the quarter-finals, added: “We all ask ourselves questions.</p>
      <p>“If he will come back, if he will not come back, if the club will keep him… I find it unfortunate because he is a very good player, a very good guy.”</p>

      <p>All the French-based players who were with countries eliminated at the end of the pool stages of the World Cup were generally due to be back training with their clubs by Monday, October 28, except in the case of injury.</p>
      <p>It was reported earlier in this week that so annoyed were Racing with the situation that they were exploring <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/leone-nakarawa-is-potentially-facing-the-sack-at-racing-92/">the potential of Nakarawa’s dismissal for serious misconduct</a> rather than merely issue a warning or a sanction.</p>
