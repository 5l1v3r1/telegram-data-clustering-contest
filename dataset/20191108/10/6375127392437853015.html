      <h3>AGENTS of the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group on Thursday arrested a 45-year old radio broadcaster in Calapan City in Oriental Mindoro denounced by his colleagues for collecting grease money from local ‘perya’ or mini-carnival operators in the province.</h3>
      <p>A report to PNP-CIDG director, Brigadier General Joel Napoleon M. Coronel, identified the suspect as Edison Neo Mancera, an announcer of 102.9 FM Radio Natin stationed in Oriental Mindoro.</p>
      <p>According to CIDG Region 4-B chief, Lt. Col. Adonis Guzman, the suspect was arrested by his men and the members of the Calapan City Police Station during an entrapment operation in Barangay Lalud in Calapan City at around 1:20 p.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>Guzman said that the arrest stemmed from a complaint from one Adoracion Delgado and members of the Mimaropa PNP Press Corps that Mancera was allegedly extorting money from owners/operators of ‘peryahan’ in the province using the name of the local media organization.</p>
      <p>“Members of the local PNP Press Corps accompanied Delgado to our office to file a complaint against Mancera after they learned that their names were being used by the suspect to collect protection money from the ‘perya’ operators,” said the official.</p>
