      <p>The billionaire boom has grounded to a halt, as a year of political upheaval took its toll on the world’s super-wealthy. </p>
      <p>A new report has found that billionaires’ wealth dipped by $388bn in 2018, following five years of growth. </p>

      <p>While the Americas saw a slight wealth increase this year, led by prominent US tech billionaires, in Asia the number of billionaires edged down after five years of sharp growth.</p>
      <p>Women are also joining the ultra-rich ranks in greater numbers, according to the findings from UBS and PwC, with the number of female billionaires growing by 46 per cent in the last five years.</p>
      <p>“The stronger dollar, combined with greater uncertainty in equity markets amidst a tough geopolitical environment, has created the conditions for this dip,” said Josef Stadler, head of ultra high net worth at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p>
      <p>He added: “Nevertheless, it’s clear that billionaire businesses continue to thrive. Billionaires are creating and steering businesses that consistently outperform equity markets.</p>
      <p>“This business acumen has also translated into their philanthropy, as billionaires seek new ways to engineer far-reaching environmental and social change.”</p>

      <p>Despite slowing growth last year, billionaire wealth is over a third higher (34.5 per cent) than five years earlier, amounting to an increase of $2.2 trillion.</p>
      <p>Billionaire companies listed on the equity markets also outperformed the global benchmark by 8.7 percent in the 15 years to the end of 2018.</p>
