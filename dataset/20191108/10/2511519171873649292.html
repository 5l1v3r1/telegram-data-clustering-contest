      <h1>Divock Origi: Liverpool escape punishment for offensive banner as incident not reported by Uefa</h1>
      <h2>The banner was confiscated and destroyed before the game in Genk started</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:44:28+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Latham-Coyle</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> have escaped punishment for the controversial banner depicting a caricature of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/divock-origi">Divock Origi</a>. </p>
      <p>The banner was held up by supporters during the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/UEFAChampionsLeague">Champions League</a> win over <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/genk">Genk</a> last month before being confiscated and destroyed by staff at the ground.</p>
      <p>And despite the banner “perpetuating a racist stereotype” and being condemned as “completely unacceptable” by the club, the incident was not reported by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/UEFA">Uefa</a> match delegate.</p>
      <p>As it was not included in the official report of the match, no action can be taken against Liverpool for the incident.</p>
      <p>“The club condemns the highly offensive banner displayed prior to kick-off,” a club statement read in the immediate aftermath of the incident.</p>
      <p>“To be clear, the image used perpetuated a racist stereotype and this is completely unacceptable.</p>
      <p>“We acted swiftly to have the banner removed and are now working with local authorities and the stadium team in Genk to identify those responsible.</p>
      <p>“Any subsequent action will be taken in keeping with our sanctions process.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool would win the fixture 4-1 after the banner was destroyed 35 minutes ahead of kick-off.</p>
