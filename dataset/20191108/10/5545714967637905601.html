      <p>Square Enix has launched <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</i> on all platforms, bringing Lara Croft's 2018 escapade, along with all previously-released DLC add-ons, to PC, PS4 and Xbox One in one handy package.<br/><br/>Launching in September of last year, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-521668.phtml"><i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</i></a> sees Lara traveling through the tropico of South America, exploring the Incan city of Paititi and once again saving the world from a squad of dangerous mercenaries, not to mention an ancient evil accidentally dug up from the depths. <i>Shadow</i> is the third - and seemingly final - chapter of the <i>Tomb Raider</i> reboot, which began back in 2013 with Crystal Dynamics' violent and more "realistic" take on the franchise.<br/><br/>The Definitive Edition includes the original <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</i> bundled with all seven DLC tombs - such as <i>The Path Home, The Pillar</i> and<i> The Forge</i>, among others. Also included are all DLC weapons and character skins, the bonuses from the "Croft Edition", and an all-new "Croft Fitness" outfit, because those guns don't sculpt themselves.<br/><br/><i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</i> is available now on PS4, PC and Xbox One, with a Stadia release planned for late November.</p>
