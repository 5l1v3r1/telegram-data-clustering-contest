      <p>Though <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/daveeast/profile">Dave East</a> has always kept unapologetic New York energy, his credentials extend well beyond the Big Apple. As such,<a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/dave-east-shares-survival-ft-rick-ross-teyana-taylor-lil-baby-gunn-fabolous-and-more-new-mixtape.119751.html"> his brand new album <i>Survival </i></a>features a diverse cast of supporting players, including Atlanta's own <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-baby/profile/">Lil Baby</a>. We've already seen Dave and <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tags/gunna/">Gunna</a> link up for a magnificent <i>Karma 2 </i>highlight, so there's a certain inevitability surrounding the ominous "Night Shift." East and Baby's distinctive styles complement one another rather nicely, and each emcee takes to the up-tempo instrumental with a sense of purpose.</p>
      <p>East, one of the game's most reliable lyricists, sets it off with a dexterous verse. "I got like nine bitches in the Sprinter, I just got some head, she just wanted dinner," he raps. "Half my n***s dead, half of 'em in the prison." A reminder that while he came from the struggle, he's almost certainly reaping a reward or two in his current state. Lil Baby closes the track, matching East's intensity with a melodic flow; at this stage, Baby has proven himself time and time again, to the point where even the bar-spitters are reaching out.</p>

      </p>
      <p>I got like nine bitches in the Sprinter<br/>I just got some head, she just wanted dinner<br/>Half my n***s dead, half of 'em in the prison<br/>Forty on me handle business<br/>I ain't got no time to think about the witness<br/>Leave 'em in the river, wakin' up with fishes<br/>I get all my diamonds from the district</p>
