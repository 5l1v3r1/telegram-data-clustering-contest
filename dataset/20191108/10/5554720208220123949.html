      <p>The Congress has reacted angrily on the reports that the Centre’s Narendra Modi government has decided to withdraw the Special Protection Group (SPG) cover of Nehru-Gandhi family including Congress President Sonia Gandhi, her son Rahul Gandhi and daughter Priyanka Gandhi.</p>

      <p>According to media reports, the government has decided to replace their security cover by Z+ cover, which will consist of CRPF men taking care of their security. The home ministry has reportedly concluded that the members of the Gandhi family did not face significant threats to their lives.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the news, former union minister, Salman Khurshid, said the decision was unfortunate and smacked of political vendetta by the BJP-led government.</p>
      <p>Congress MP and close aide of Sonia Gandhi, Ahmed Patel, tweeted, “The BJP has descended to the ultimate personal vendetta mechanism, compromising the lives of family members of 2 Former Prime Ministers to acts of terror and violence.”</p>

      <p>The decision follows a similar step taken by the MHA to downgrade the security cover of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from SPG to Z+ category.</p>

      <p>Many Congress supporters took to social media to remind the government that two members of the same family, both prime ministers, were assassinated in the past. While Indira Gandhi was killed by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984, her son Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by Tamil terrorists seven years later.</p>
