      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 8 — Bursa Malaysia ended the week on a positive note after a range-bound trading day to close marginally higher, prompted by institutional support.</p>

      <p>An analyst said the index today was mainly supported by local institutions, while foreign, as well as retail investors are staying on the sidelines, as they await the release of key economic data next week.</p>
      <p>“These data would serve as a benchmark on how the local economy is doing despite headwinds in the global environment, hence, they would determine the direction of the market,” she said.</p>

      <p>For top gainers, Vstecs rose 19 sen to RM1.25, Shangri-La hotels surged 29 sen to RM5.29, and Dufu Technology and Tasek Corporation advanced 13 sen to RM2.94 and RM5.50, respectively.</p>
      <p>The top losers were led by Nestle which shed RM1.20 to RM145.70, followed by Kuala Lumpur Kepong which declined 40 sen to RM22.50 and United Plantation which lost 30 sen to RM25.58.</p>
      <p>The FBM Emas Index was 6.34 higher at 11,395.72, the FBMT 100 Index gained 5.01 points to 11,207.06 and the FBM Emas Shariah Index decreased 26.02 points to 11,893.78.</p>
