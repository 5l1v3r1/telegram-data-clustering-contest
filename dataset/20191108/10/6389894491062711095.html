      <p>The demand for staff from UK employers grew at its slowest rate for almost eight years in October, according to a survey revealed on Friday.</p>
      <p>A monthly index of job vacancies from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and accountants KPMG fell to 51.7 from 52.6 in September.</p>

      <p>It is the index’s lowest level since January 2012 and highlights concerns from the Bank of England that the UK’s labour market may be losing its strength.</p>
      <p>It comes a day after two of the Bank of England’s nine interest-rate setters voted to cut interest rates again.</p>
      <p>The pair cited signs that the labour marker may be on the turn, despite it being one of the economy’s strong points since the Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>The REC report released on Friday showed permanent job placements fell for an eighth consecutive month and at a faster rate than last month.</p>
      <p>It comes as official data showed job creation was waning ahead of the previous end of October Brexit deadline.</p>

      <p>Vice chairman at KMPG, James Stewart, said the uncertainty around Brexit and the upcoming general election on 12 December had dampened companies’ hiring plans.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just businesses that are being cautious, however, and over October we’ve seen job-seekers become increasingly nervous about making a career change,” he said.</p>
