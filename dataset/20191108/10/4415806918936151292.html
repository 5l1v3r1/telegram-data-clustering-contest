      <p>Michael McFarlane tweeted a video of fans walking in the dark and wrote: “Our shuttle bus broke down 1km from the stadium. Driver chucked us out, meaning we had to walk through the Lazio neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>“After this video, about 20 Lazio fans sprinted from the dark and ambushed the group at the river. Got away safe, not sure about others.”</p>
      <p>Rab Robertson wrote: “Fair squad of us ambushed, weans the lot, completely co-ordinated, hopefully all safe”, while Thomas Lunday tweeted: “Not enough buses to take everyone back to the city, so rest of the fans had to walk a couple miles further on that’s when they where ambushed by casuals.”</p>
      <p>The Celtic fan liaison officer advised fans to “keep a low profile” as they returned from the game.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: “Wee update for fans in Rome, don’t walk back to town, get taxis or shuttle buses back to the city and keep a low profile.”</p>
      <p>The club had issued safety advice to fans amid tensions after a match between the clubs in Glasgow last month.</p>

      <p>Supporters were advised to avoid wearing club colours while walking around Rome, particularly in the evening, stay in large groups where possible and keep a low profile.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow club and Lazio were charged by Uefa over “illicit chants” heard during their Europa League match on October 24.</p>
      <p>Celtic were also charged over the display of an “illicit banner” during the game, which they won 2-1.</p>
