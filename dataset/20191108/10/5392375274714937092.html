      <p>Huawei Mobile Services ecosystem is coming soon – Who needs Google?<br/>4.5 (89.57%) 23 votes</p>
      <p>According to some users, “HMS Service” (<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/huawei">Huawei</a> Mobile Services) is available in the latest Huawei Sports Health App test version. This means that the HMS ecosystem is on its way and will probably be arriving soon. Recall that Huawei has said that it does not need to replace Android, just Google Mobile Service (GMS). To this end, HMS could be a viable alternative to GMS. Nevertheless, the process of HMS development is far from easy.</p>

      <p>Huawei has funding and incentives for eco developers to cover maps, music, videos, emails and other fields. HMS was originally launched during the Huawei Developers Conference in 2019. It was opened to foreign developers in October 2019 – providing access for developers outside China. Huawei Mobile, Huawei Watch and Huawei Health App on Huawei Bands will be able to access the Huawei Map Kit. HMS is Huawei’s suite of applications and services for its device ecosystem. It is designed to provide a smarter, faster and seamless experience for users around the world.</p>
