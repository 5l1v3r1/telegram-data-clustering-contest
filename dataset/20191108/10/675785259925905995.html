      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer issues challenge to Man Utd starlet Mason Greenwood</h1>
      <h2>Greenwood underlined his vast potential with a fine goal in the Europa League on Thursday night and is looking to become a regular at Old Trafford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:00:41+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has told Mason Greenwood he must 'man up' before he can become a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> regular.</p>
      <p>Greenwood, 18, underlined his huge potential with the opening goal in United's 3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade, which secured their place in the Europa League knockout stage.</p>
      <p>It was Greenwood's third United goal this season, but the young striker has had to patient, with Solskjaer determined to ease him into the first-team set-up.</p>
      <p>“Mason is going to have a very big career, but sometimes it's not the right time to play him,” said Solskjaer. “He knows why he hasn’t played as much.</p>
      <p>“He needs to learn the man’s game. He’s gone up from the under-18s last year, now he’s training with the first-team every day and you can’t just turn that switch on and off.</p>

      <p>“We’re taking our time with him. It’s been a difficult period. Anthony Martial has been away, and to put all the weight on his shoulder wasn’t right, either.</p>
      <p>“I think we're finding the right balance between playing him, resting him and training him.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to perform every day if you are going to be accepted by a group like this."</p>

      <p>Solskjaer deployed Greenwood on the right of a front three against Partizan, a position new signing Dan James has made his own with an impressive start to his United career.</p>
      <p>But Solskjaer sees Greenwood as another option there, with Martial now preferred as a central striker and Marcus Rashford on the left.</p>
      <p>“Mason's definitely one option on the right,” said Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>“I rested Dan against Partizan because he’s played too much football for my liking, so maybe Mason hasn’t played enough.</p>
      <p>“If he’d really stamped his authority in training every single day and been the best option, he would have played every game.</p>
      <p>“But as a young boy you expect ups and downs and he’s had some downs. But I think he's on his way up again and I think we'll see a top, top player there one day.”</p>

      <p>Solskjaer was asked if Greenwood's finishing – and in particular his deadly left foot - reminded him of former United striker Robin van Persie.</p>
      <p>“Definitely,” said Solskjaer. “He's very composed as well with his finishing. It's just what he does, it's natural to him.</p>
      <p>“Right foot, left foot – I don’t think he still knows which is the best one, which is very difficult for defenders to defend against.</p>
      <p>“He’s doing his finishing practice and I can see it every day. The good thing is he can do it at Old Trafford in front of a full crowd or 62,000.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t get fazed by the occasion. He’s still composed. Whether that’s a game with his mates in the park or a cup final, he'll still finish the same, hopefully.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer, whose side host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> tomorrow, has centred his rebuild around young players and drafted several into the first-team squad, including Greenwood, Brandon Williams and James Garner.</p>
      <p>“You always get assessed on results now, but the DNA of this club – and it’s always been in our philosophy and my philosophy - is to give young players with the right attitude a chance.” said Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>'If that takes a couple of years for Mason to really, really come through, it’s worth it for us.</p>
      <p>“I’m managing for Manchester United, I’m not managing for me. I'm managing for the best way I think we can get the best out of Mason.”</p>
