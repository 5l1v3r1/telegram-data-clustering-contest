      <h1>Amazon removes children's ‘Daddy’s little slut’ T-shirt following criticism</h1>
      <h2>Product description suggested top was suitable for baptisms</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:20:09+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author">Olivia Petter</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/amazon">Amazon</a> has removed a children’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/T-shirt">T-shirt</a> from its <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07SXTR9R3%2Fref%3Dask_ql_qh_dp_hza">website </a>that read: “Daddy’s little slut”.</p>
      <p>The product was being sold by third party retailer <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Frh%3Dn%253A7141123011%252Cp_4%253AOnlybabycare%26ref%3Dw_bl_sl_s_ap_web_7141123011">Onlybabycare</a>, which sells other children’s apparel items via the retailer, such as Taco Bell slogan tees and a hat bearing the words: “<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMatter-Cotton-Hunting-Newsboy-Trucker%2Fdp%2FB07VY79XXP%2Fref%3Dsr_1_47%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C9194486%7CB07VY79XXP">Black guns matter</a>”.</p>
      <p>The “Daddy’s little slut” T-shirt had been on the website since June 2019 and was on sale for half its original price at $18 (£14).</p>
      <p>The product description read that the top was “suitable” for various occasions, including “playing outside, birthday party, baby shower, baptism, wedding, baby photography, daily wear, family day”.</p>
      <p>It added that the T-shirt was unisex and suitable for “little girls or boys”. It only offered shipping to the US and not the UK.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, a Twitter user posted a screenshot of the T-shirt, calling for its removal from Amazon.</p>
      <p>“Posting here in hopes it’ll expedite removal from Amazon,” they wrote.</p>
      <p>The tweet has received more than 500 likes and hundreds of comments from users concurring that the top should be removed while others said they had reported the item to the retailer.</p>
      <p>“If I ever saw a child wearing this t-shirt, I’d call the police,” <a href="https://twitter.com/PhoenixRisingSt/status/1192678276675915776">tweeted</a> one person.</p>
      <p>“This is too disgraceful,” <a href="https://twitter.com/globalerica/status/1192678146107232256">added</a> another.</p>
      <p>An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to <i>The Independent </i>that the T-shirt in question had been removed.</p>
      <p>“All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account,” they said. “The product in question is no longer available.”</p>
      <p>The T-shirt comes after online retailer Redbubble faced similar <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/redbubble-fashion-allah-miniskirts-designs-removed-a8924956.html">criticisms</a> over its “Allah” miniskirts after they were labelled “offensive” and “disrespectful” on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Redbubble had been selling a range of miniskirts bearing phrases such as “Praise be to Allah” and “without Allah I am nothing”, which were branded “point blank inappropriate” and “shocking” by shoppers.</p>
      <p>The retailer <a href="https://twitter.com/RedbubbleHelp/status/1130080328771461120">responded</a> to the complaints on Twitter, telling shoppers that the content printed on their products was “not in line with our Community Guidelines” and that it would remove them immediately.</p>
      <p>Just weeks previously, Redbubble had come <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/auschwitz-skirts-redbubble-nazi-concentration-camp-museum-poland-a8904676.html">under fire</a> for selling skirts and pillows with images of Auschwitz printed on them. The black and white skirts depicting the former Nazi concentration camp were described as “disturbing” by Auschwitz museum officials.</p>
      <p>Redbubble responded by admitting that the items were “not acceptable” and that it would take “immediate action” to remove them from sale.</p>
