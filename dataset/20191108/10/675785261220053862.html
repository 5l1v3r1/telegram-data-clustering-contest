      <h2>Dubbed ‘silence the critics’, IKEA has just launched its first ever Christmas advert - with a very well executed, modern twist</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:19:47+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:19</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p>Christmas advert season is here, and even though we're still yet to see John Lewis' highly-anticipated offering, we reckon <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ikea">IKEA</a> has already won the crown.</p>
      <p>For the first time ever, the famous Swedish home store has launched a Christmas advert - and they're kicking things off in style, by launching one with its very own original - and exceedingly catchy - grime track.</p>
      <p>Dubbed 'Silence the Critics', the impressive campaign kicks off with a feeling most of us have felt at one point over Christmas: home shame over the state of their house - and the concerning thought of impending guests.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a whole host of home ornaments and objects come to life - including a very creepy-looking teapot - taunting them about the state of their home.</p>
      <p>But the star of the show is the music behind it all, which comes out of the mouths of the taunting toys and ornaments, who perform an original grime track, voiced by legendary MC D Double E.</p>

      <p>Deciding to take action and address their house, the couple easily spruce up their place with some simple and affordable <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fgb%2Fen%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fikea-unveil-first-ever-christmas-20839514">IKEA solutions,</a> such as a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fgb%2Fen%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fikea-unveil-first-ever-christmas-20839514">dining table, rug, curtains</a> and carefully placed picture frames to hide a crack in the wall. Yet another overly relatable feeling...</p>
      <p>The advert deliberately goes against the tide of sentimental Christmas ads, and aims to delight audiences with its humorous, irreverent take on festive hosting.</p>
      <p>The campaign launches across broadcast and VOD TV, cinema and digital media today (Friday 8 November), with the ad airing for the first time during the Gogglebox break on C4.</p>
      <p>UK and Ireland marketing manager, Sarah Green, says: “Our first IKEA Christmas advert focuses on the phenomenon of ‘home shame’ - encouraging people to overcome the negative voices in their head holding them back from open up their homes.</p>
      <p>“It was born from the common feeling that, along with the seasonal joys, a lot of us feel a looming sense of dread when it comes to hosting others with many of us feel ashamed of our homes over the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>We believe that every home can and should be worthy of a get-together and that with a little imagination, some clever products and ideas, there’s no reason not to be proud to invite your nearest and dearest over. This campaign aims to inspire us all to get our homes party-ready and ‘Silence the Critics’, once and for all.”</p>
