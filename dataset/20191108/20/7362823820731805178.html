      <p>He also explained if he's going to be more public with his private life from here on out.</p>
      <p>“Every experience in life is a chance for us to know who we are and who we’re not, and just because I went down one avenue in life doesn’t mean I’m going to repeat going down that avenue,” he said referencing his former fiancee and reality TV star <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nikki-bella-breaks-down-in-tears-after-moving-out-of-john-cenas-house.amp">Nikki Bella</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think if there is a learning experience for me and a takeaway for me, it’s OK to be who you are and it’s OK to establish boundaries," Cena added.</p>

      <p>“Just because a precedent was set doesn’t mean you need to follow that precedent, as long as you take ownership of who you are,” he continued. “If you’ve done something before and it doesn’t really mesh with who you are, it’s OK to change. It’s OK to develop and grow, and that’s the journey of life.”</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Cena and Shariatzadeh made their red carpet debut in New York City for his new movie.</p>

      <p>Cena was previously engaged to fellow WWE wrestler Nikki Bella. Wrestling fans may remember the moment when <a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/5383390102001/#sp=show-clips">John Cena proposed to Nikki Bella</a> in front of a sold-out crowd of 75,000 fans at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando, Fla. However, a year later, Nikki announced that her relationship with Cena had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/john-cena-nikki-bella-break-up-details-revealed">come to an end</a>.</p>

      <p>The breakup came as a shock to both reality TV and wrestling fans, as their relationship was front and center whenever they were featured on “Total Divas,” “Total Bellas” and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe">WWE programming</a>.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Bella found love again with former “Dancing with the Stars” partner Artem Chigvintsev. The couple started dating earlier this year.</p>
