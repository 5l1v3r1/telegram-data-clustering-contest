      <blockquote><b>MEGYN KELLY: </b>Did you leak the tape?<b> </b> <b>ASHLEY BIANCO: </b>I did not. <b>KELLY: </b>Not to anyone at any time? <b>BIANCO: </b>No, never. <b>KELLY: </b>Did you make a clip of the moment? <b>BIANCO: </b>I did, but I saved it in the internal system. <b>KELLY: </b>What was your job at ABC? <b>BIANCO: </b>I was a crash producer. <b>KELLY: </b>Okay, so a producer. And you were in the control room when Amy [Robach] made those comments? <b>BIANCO: </b>I wasn’t in the control room, but I was watching the comments while I was at my desk and I had seen what she was saying and I went to my manager and said: “Do you see what she’s saying? Does she know she’s on a hot mic?” The assistant said to us that Amy knew she was on a mic and that she knew she was being broadcasted to all the affiliates. <b>KELLY: </b>Right. This is a moment where she’s off the air and doing tapped promos, but she has a mic on and people can see and hear her. <b>BIANCO: </b>Yeah. <b>KELLY: </b>So what did you do? You clipped the moment, marked the moment in the system? <b>BIANCO: </b>Yeah, I just clipped it off. I essentially marked it in the system. It never left the system. We do it all the time. <b>KELLY: </b>Did you tell the manager that you had clipped it? <b>BIANCO: </b>I did not. <b>KELLY: </b>Did you think it was newsworthy what she was saying? <b>BIANCO: </b>Everyone in the office was freaked out about what she was saying. Everyone was watching it. … <b>KELLY: </b>In the fall, you decided to leave ABC to go where? <b>BIANCO: </b>To CBS. I only left purely because CBS had offered me a good contract. And so I left and was really excited to start a new job. <b>KELLY: </b>And so this week, you’re sitting at CBS doing your job and what happens with Project Veritas? <b>BIANCO: </b>They released the video and I was shocked, but I didn’t think anything of it. <b>KELLY: </b>How many days had you been at CBS? <b>BIANCO: </b>Only four days. I begged and pleaded. I didn’t know what I had done wrong. I wasn’t even given the professional courtesy to defend myself. I didn’t know what I had been accused of. It was humiliating and devastating.</blockquote>
