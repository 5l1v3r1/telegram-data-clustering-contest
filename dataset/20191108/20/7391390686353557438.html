      <p>Kanye West wants to make sure that nobody forgets that he considers himself a genius — so much so, that he's willing to make it a part of his name. During a surprise appearance alongside wife Kim Kardashian at the Fast Company Innovation Festival on Nov. 7, <a href="https://www.etonline.com/kanye-west-talks-changing-his-name-to-christian-billionaire-genius-and-2024-presidential-run-135912">Kanye West said he might want to change his name to "Christian Genius Billionaire"</a> in order to ensure that everyone gives him his proper due as an entrepreneur.</p>
      <p>West's revelation that he's considering a name change came during a conversation about the way that society and the media often denies the black community the credit for their accomplishments. "When I did <i>Forbes</i>, I showed them a $890 million receipt and they still didn't say 'billionaire,'" the rapper said, referencing the feature which called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/07/09/kanyes-second-coming-inside-the-billion-dollar-yeezy-empire/#8bfdcbe5ec3e">Yeezy a "billion-dollar empire,"</a> during a panel discussion with Yeezy footwear designer Stephen Smith. "They don't want us to know that we can buy land; they don't want us to have the 100 percent ownership I have at Yeezy."</p>
      <p>He continued, "When people say it's crass <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/06/14/kanye-west-net-worth-240-million-in-2019/#69d050c51291">to call yourself a billionaire</a>, I say I might legally change my name to Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West for a year until y'all understand exactly what it is," he continued. "It will be on the license plate." West also touched on those issues in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivCY3Ec4iaU&amp;feature=youtu.be">the music video for "Follow God,"</a> released following the discussion on Nov. 8. Along with the video — which features West and his father driving around the rapper's property in Wyoming — <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1192879201176539136">West wrote on Twitter</a> that his father was shocked that "a black man" owned 4,000 acres of land when he first visited the Wests in the country.</p>

      <p>West has often shared conflicting statements about his net worth. In February of 2016, the rapper wrote on Twitter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/15/kanye-west-53m-debt-mark-zuckerberg-larry-page-martin-shkreli">that he was $53 million in debt</a>, and asked moguls Mark Zukerberg and Larry Page to invest in him in a series of since-deleted tweets. After asking the Facebook founder to "invest 1 billion dollars into Kanye West ideas," the rapper continued, "I’m this generation’s Disney … I want to bring dope sh*t to the world … I don’t have enough resources to create what I really can."</p>
      <p>A few months later, he told Ellen DeGeneres that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/20/kanye-west-realizes-why-mark-zuckerberg-didnt-give-him-1-billion.html">he asked for the money</a> in order to help fuel the great ideas that he's had over the years. "I feel like that if I had more resources I can help more people," West said during an appearance on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>. "I have ideas that can make the human race existence within our 100 years better. Period."</p>
      <p>However, in an August cover story for <i>Forbes</i> magazine, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/07/09/kanyes-second-coming-inside-the-billion-dollar-yeezy-empire/#108776ec5ec3">West said he was able to turn his life around</a> thanks to his newfound devotion to religion. "I’m just blessed through the grace of God to go from tweeting at Mark Zuckerberg [for money]" West said, to being named a "centi-millionaire" by <i>Forbes</i> and being the creative force behind a company worth $1.5 billion.</p>

      <p>West has previously spoken about how his faith in Christianity has been a major positive force in his life <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/arts/music/kanye-west-hospitalized-exhaustion.html">after his 2016 hospitalization</a>. "I will continue to be used by God," he told Apple Music Beats 1 DJ Zane Lowe recently, explaining that find God has set him on a new path. "No one loves pain but I’m still, through the good times and the suffering I praise God because I experience the blessings and I also experience the lessons."</p>
      <p>Perhaps changing his name to "Christian Genius Billionaire" will teach him one of those lessons.</p>
