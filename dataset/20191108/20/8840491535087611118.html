      <p>GARDA Commissioner Drew Harris attended a meeting of the Mayo Joint Policing Committee in Castlebar this afternoon (Friday).</p>
      <p>He discussed the new garda operating model, which will see Mayo amalgamated into one garda division with Roscommon and Leitrim next year, with councillors and community representatives.</p>
      <p>Community policing and having more frontline gardai are key aims of the new model.</p>
      <p>Concerns raised by JPC members included the vast size of the division and the availability of resources to fulfil the ambitions set out.</p>
      <p>This was a historic meeting as it was the first time a Commissioner attended a local authority meeting in Mayo.</p>
