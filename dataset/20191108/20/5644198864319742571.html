      <p>CAPE TOWN: African football's ruling body has scrapped a US$1 billion television and marketing rights deal with Lagardere Sports in the wake of separate judgments that it breached competition rules, but Lagardere said it would fight to enforce the contract.</p>
      <p>The French-based company called the Confederation of African Football's (CAF) move "unlawful, unreasonable and unjustified" and said it would defend its agreement with CAF that runs from 2017 to 2028.</p>

      <p>It suggested that it may accept changes to the terms of the deal but that if all else fails it would seek compensation in cash.</p>
      <p>CAF said it had no choice but to cancel the deal after two court judgments went against it.</p>
      <p>A Cairo court ruled last November that the agreement breached "Egyptian competition rules because Lagardere was appointed as CAF's exclusive agent for marketing and media rights for an uninterrupted 20-year period without any open tender," CAF said in a statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>The court fined CAF 100 million Egyptian pounds (US$6.2 million).</p>
      <p>The Competition Commission of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (CCC) had also found in 2017 that the agreement infringed competition regulations.</p>
      <p>"Given the above developments, CAF had no choice but to terminate the agreement," it said.</p>
      <p>"Termination of the agreement is the legal consequence of the judgments of Egyptian courts and the recommendations and imminent decision of the CCC," it said.</p>
      <p>Arnaud Lagardere, managing partner at the French firm, said it would fight CAF's move, accepting changes if necessary - or seeking cash compensation for the lost business.</p>
      <p>"We have here a very, very strong case and we'll do whatever it takes either to maintain the contract, deal with more changes or get a significant amount of cash," he said in a statement to reporters on Friday.</p>
      <p>"This is really unfair and even if I know that no one should be too candid or na√Øve in this business, I think we don't deserve such a treatment."</p>
      <p>Lagardere Sports did not directly address the court or the CCC's view that its agreement breached competition regulations.</p>
      <p>Lagardere has been involved in television production of CAF events for almost two decades.</p>
      <p>Broadcasters said planned coverage of next week's Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, which Lagardere was responsible for, had been cancelled. Such cancellations have occurred previously, although usually for logistical reasons.</p>
