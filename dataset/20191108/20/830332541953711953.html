      <p>NEW YORK (CNN) - Over 130 pounds of narcotics were seized in a Queens-based drug trafficking operation, including one of the largest seizures of a drug 100 times more potent than fentanyl, said the Queens County District Attorney.</p>
      <p>Acting District Attorney John Ryan and New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill announced that 11 people were arrested in connection to a drug dealing operation that spanned from California to New York. Ten were arrested in Queens County and one was arrested in Rockland County.</p>
      <p>Law enforcement seized a total of six firearms, 68 pounds of cocaine, 50 pounds of fentanyl, 11 pounds of carfentanil, 8 pounds of heroin, and "various quantities" of ketamine and tramadol, <a href="http://www.queensda.org/newpressreleases/2019/NOV_2019/arias_giovanny_et%20al_10_21_2019_cmp.pdf">according to a press release</a>.</p>
      <p>The seizure of carfentanil, a synthetic opioid approximately 100 times more potent than fentanyl, is the largest seizure of its kind, Ryan said in the release.</p>
      <p>"The main defendant in this case operated a complicated illegal network of dealers and traffickers, who pumped deadly drugs which continue to contribute to the opioid epidemic in our communities," said Ryan.</p>
      <p>The investigation was in conjunction with the New York Police Department's Major Case Squad. According to the charges, the Major Case Squad found the drugs and firearms at a variety of locations throughout the investigation, often in trucks or at stash houses in Queens.</p>
      <p>"These arrests and the significant seizure of narcotics exemplify the NYPD's commitment, with its law enforcement partners, to stopping drug traffickers from disrupting our communities," said O'Neill.</p>
      <p>Some of the charges include operating as a major drug trafficker, criminal possession of a controlled substance and conspiracy. If convicted, those charged could face 20 to 25 years to life, depending on their charges.</p>
