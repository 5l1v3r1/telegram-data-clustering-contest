      <p>LAUSANNE: Former UEFA president Michel Platini is taking action to obtain substantial amounts of back pay as well as a bonus and legal fees, he told AFP on Friday (Nov 8).</p>
      <p>According to sources close to Platini, whose four-year suspension from football ended in October, the former France international is seeking to recoup around €7.2 million (US$7.9 million), including €5.5 million in back pay.</p>

      <p>Platini did not confirm the amounts.</p>
      <p>"Through my lawyer, I am asking for the contractual elements to be applied," Platini said.</p>
      <p>A triple Ballon d'Or winner, Platini was expected to succeed Sepp Blatter as FIFA president in 2016 but fell spectacularly from grace a few months earlier.</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old was suspended by world football's governing body in 2015 over a controversial payment of two million Swiss francs (€1.8 million, US$2 million) that he received from Blatter.</p>
      <p>The payment, made in 2011 when Blatter was seeking re-election as president, was related to work carried out by Platini between 1999 and 2002.</p>
      <p>Platini has always insisted he did nothing wrong.</p>
      <p>His suspension ended on October 6 and he has said he now hopes to find a new role in football.</p>
      <p>The former Juventus star said the bonus that he wanted repaid was linked to the organisation of Euro 2016.</p>
      <p>Platini's Swiss lawyer Vincent Solari confirmed that legal proceedings had begun.</p>
      <p>"We have claimed the remaining amount of the back pay which we believe is owed according to the contract."</p>
      <p>Blatter was subsequently suspended for six years after presiding over world football 18 years from 1998 to 2015.</p>
