      <h2>One of the most successful NY mayor in history</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:39:53+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Chauncey Alcorn</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Entrepreneur and philanthropist-turned politician Michael Bloomberg has been called one of most successful New York mayors in the city's history.</p>
      <p>Now the 77-year-old media mogul apparently wants to be president, too. He is preparing to file paperwork in Alabama to qualify for that state's presidential primary. He has one big supporter already--fellow billionaire businessman Leon Cooperman, an outspoken critic of leading Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg is wealthy enough to fund his own campaign. Forbes estimates his current net worth at $52.4 billion--an amount that dwarfs not only the value of President Donald Trump's real estate empire, but also the fortunes of fellow media moguls Rupert Murdoch, Ted Turner, and Sumner Redstone combined.</p>
      <p>Just how did Bloomberg, a Boston native and son of an accountant and a secretary, amass his fortune?</p>
      <p>Wall Street as we know it today wouldn't exist without his innovations. After earning his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1966, he got a job counting securities by hand in the "The Cage" at the former New York investment bank known as Salomon Brothers.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg became a Wall Street star at the firm, whose leaders later convinced him to manage the company's fledgling computer systems unit in 1979.</p>
      <p>Eventually Bloomberg worked his way up to general partner before being let go in 1981, when Salomon merged with commodities trading firm Phibro Corporation. He received a $10 million severance.</p>
      <p>He used that money to begin building his financial media empire, co-founding Innovative Market Systems with Charles Zegar, Thomas Secunda, and Duncan MacMillan the same year.</p>
      <p>"I didn't sit around wondering what was happening at the old firm," Bloomberg wrote in his 2001 autobiography "Bloomberg by Bloomberg". "I didn't go back and visit. I never look over my shoulder. Once finished: Gone. Life continues!"</p>
      <p>The then-39-year-old used the financial know-how and information technology expertise he developed at Salomon to create the Bloomberg terminal in 1982, a software system with a specialized keyboard used by financial professionals to trade stocks electronically and access live market data.</p>
      <p>The apparatus revolutionized an analog Wall Street and became a ubiquitous tool used in investment banking, competing with Thomson Reuters Eikon, FactSet, and S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p>
      <p>Innovative Market Systems was renamed Bloomberg L.P. in 1986. In 1990, the company created its own news service before launching Bloomberg.com in 1993.</p>
      <p>Not content with business success, Bloomberg ran for mayor of New York City in 2001, succeeding Rudolph Giuliani in the aftermath of 9/11. Bloomberg's time as mayor was riddled with controversial policies such as stop-and-frisk policing, the rise of charter schools, and pressuring the city council to temporarily change the rules on term limits so he could run for a third term.</p>
      <p>But New York City's overall quality of life improved under Bloomberg's tenure. Crime rates dropped. Graduation rates at city schools rose. So did city revenues and Bloomberg's own net worth.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg L.P.'s terminal user base has more than doubled, to 325,000 subscribers currently from 160,000 in 2001, according to the company.</p>
      <p>With a price point of $24,000 per subscriber for its terminals, the privately-held company's annual revenue eclipsed $10 billion in 2018, according to an analyst estimate.</p>
      <p>In March, Forbes ranked Bloomberg as the ninth richest person in the world and the wealthiest media mogul on the planet.</p>
