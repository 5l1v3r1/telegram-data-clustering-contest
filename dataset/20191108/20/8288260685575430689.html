      <p>As the days get colder and darker, many of us will be cranking up our thermostats.</p>
      <p>That means more household gas and electricity consumption over winter and, while it might be covered by the credit you've built up over summer, it's not uncommon for energy companies to want to increase direct debits at this time of year.</p>
      <p>There's always the opportunity to switch to a new provider but what about making sure you don't use as much energy in the first place?</p>

      <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, fuelling the house is one of the largest expenses for UK families.</p>
      <p>But there are ways of getting wealthier and warmer in no time.</p>
      <p>Penny pinching pros at NetVoucherCodes.co.uk have advised Brits on how to save money as the winter chill creeps in.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for NetVoucherCodes.co.uk commented: "Many of us have accepted that the high cost of heating ours houses is just a fact of life, but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
      <p>"There are lots of different tricks we can all use to keep more pounds in our pocket and also enjoy more comfortable homes as winter sets in."</p>
      <p>Here are some top tips to keep heating costs down:</p>
      <h3>1. Put tin foil behind the radiators</h3>
      <p>Cutting sheets of this kitchen essential to fit behind radiators will work wonders for the temperature of a room. The tin foil will reflect hot air back into the room, rather than allowing it to drift away through cold walls.</p>
      <h3>2. Rearrange your furniture</h3>
      <p>Directly blocking a radiator with a bulky sofa or chair will trap the heat and not help anyone get warm this winter. So make sure you're not just heating the back of that nice comfy couch. A quick rearrangement of the furniture can work wonders and let the heat out into the room.</p>
      <h3>3. Close your curtains</h3>
      <p>Why let all that cosy hot air seep through cold glass windows, when you can block its escape by simply drawing your curtains or blinds?</p>

      <h3>4. Turn that thermostat down</h3>
      <p>Every single degree lower could save you several pounds per week. Experts recommend 18C as an ambient level, rather than a costly 20C or 25C. Try turning it down a bit, even by a degree or two.</p>
      <h3>5. Leave the oven door open after cooking</h3>
      <p>An oven full of 200C air released into the kitchen will be the perfect remedy to stave off the cold in the evening. You might also have the space to eat in the kitchen (if you have an open plan kitchen-diner with a table and chairs) and then you can really benefit from the warmth pouring out of the oven before it dissipates.</p>
      <p>Try to make the best use of the oven, too. Having it on for an hour and a half just for one solitary jacket potato is not the best use of energy. Jacket potatoes can be partly cooked in a microwave and then put in the oven for a shorter time to crisp them up. Check what everyone in the house wants for a meal before getting the oven going. And consider putting in a casserole, pie or crumble as well as your family's fishfingers and chips, to make best use of all that heat.</p>

      <h3>6. Buy a rug</h3>
      <p>It may sound simple, but you won’t be so cold walking around the house if you cover those wooden or laminate floors with an insulating cotton rug. Of course you shouldn't be going the house barefoot either, so get some socks and slippers on.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>7. Keep a jumper on</h3>
      <p>The more clothes you put on, the less the heating will be on and you’ll be saving cold hard cash in no time. Layers are the key, so don't feel silly about having a vest, shirt and your fleece hoodie on indoors.</p>
      <h3>8. Draught-proof</h3>
      <p>Plugging all those little holes around the house will make a big difference to your heating bills. Simple gaffer tape can be used to seal cracks in floors and walls, while the bottom of doors could be blocked with old clothes, towels or a proper draught-excluder.</p>

      <h3>9. Forage for firewood</h3>
      <p>Any fuel you find in the woods is free and if your fire burns for longer, the heating will need to be on less and those bills will be smaller. Of course this only applies if you have a real fire in the house but many people do.</p>
      <h3>10. Get a hot water bottle</h3>
      <p>Sometimes the old habits are the best. Using a traditional hot water bottle in bed or even while snuggled on the sofa could lead to a significant reduction in night-time heating bills.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>11. Open doors</h3>
      <p>If you have a south facing room that gets loads of direct sunlight, it will naturally be the warmest in the house. Leaving the door to that room open will allow the heated air to circulate around the house.</p>
      <h3>12. Close doors</h3>
      <p>Once the sun has set, close the door to your living room or bedroom to keep all that cosy air trapped inside.</p>
