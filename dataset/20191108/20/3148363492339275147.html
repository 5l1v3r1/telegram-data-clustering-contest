      <p>And it’s that kind of erratic behavior that has Terry Bradshaw saying he wouldn’t sign him.</p>
      <p>TMZ cameras caught up with the Fox NFL analyst in New York City on Friday.</p>
      <p>“He’s erratic,” Bradshaw told TMZ. “His behavior makes me nervous. I don’t know what’s wrong with him. It makes no sense.”</p>
      <p>While recognizing Brown’s clear and obvious talent, Bradshaw says Brown’s off-the-field issues could prove to be too much for some teams to contend with.</p>
      <p>“Ya gotta deal with a lot of stuff. Are you willing to do that?</p>
      <p>“I’d have to sit him down and I gotta make sure he’s okay,” Bradshaw concluded.</p>
