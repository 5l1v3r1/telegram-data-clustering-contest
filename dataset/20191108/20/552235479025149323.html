      <h1>Kello Rovers boss delivers hairdryer treatment to players and spark Junior Cup win</h1>
      <h2>The Nithside Park outfit moved into the fourth round of the competition after defeating Shettleston last weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:46:20+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:46</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Paterson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/colin-paterson/</a></address>
      <p>Scott Clelland revealed he gave his Kello Rovers stars the hairdryer treatment – then watched as they performed Junior Cup heroics.</p>
      <p>The Kirkconnel men pulled off a brilliant 3-1 third-round replay win over League One leaders Shettleston at Nithside Park last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Now Kello boss Clelland hopes the result will kickstart his side's campaign as they look to bounce back from last season's relegation.</p>
      <p>However, he told Ayrshire Live that he had to give his team both barrels as they went in at the break trailing despite dominating the opening stanza.</p>
      <p>He said: "I knew we would give them a better game in Kirkconnel and it's the first time I've had all my players available.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"But I had to get the hairdryer out at half-time because we conceded a goal in first half injury time.</p>
      <p>"We had so many chances and could have been 5-0 up but we ended up going in 1-0 down.</p>
      <p>"But the players did really well in the second half and it was great at the end of the game with everyone celebrating. That's the biggest crowd I've seen up there."</p>
      <p>A Declan Hill double and a Stuart Bennie goal turned the tie on its head and sent Kello into the fourth round at the expense of their divisional rivals.</p>
      <p>Shettleston's cause wasn't helped when one of their players received two red cards after arguing with some people in the crowd before he threw a water bottle.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Clelland wouldn't be drawn on the bizarre scenes but was happy to bask in the glow of the post-match knees-up which his players certainly made the most of.</p>
      <p>He added: "The pub was bouncing after the game and I think a few of the players were out until early the next day still with their club tracksuits on!</p>
      <p>"I'm hoping this result will get us going and that we can finish in the top six. We're looking good now."</p>
      <p>Kello – who travel to the east end of Glasgow tomorrow for a West of Scotland Cup first round tie with Vale of Clyde – have been drawn to face League One Larkhall Thistle at Gasworks Park in the Junior Cup.</p>
      <p>Clelland said: "I have been inundated with messages since the draw and I think both teams will feel it's a winnable tie although they will maybe start as favourites."</p>
