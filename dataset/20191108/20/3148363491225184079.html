      <h1>Warren Floats 'Suspending Deportations' to Force Immigration Reform</h1>
      <h2>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) views “suspending deportations” as a viable tactic to get Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, an idea she floated on Friday during a forum in Raleigh, North Carolina.</h2>

      <p>Warren <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWm8PxOd8Yk">participated</a> in what progressives describe as a “Latinx community conversation” and took a question from a woman who told an emotional story of her husband, who was deported after serving a jail sentence.</p>
      <p>“Senator, I have two questions. If you become president, will you pass a moratorium on deportations? And if the answer is yes, would you be willing to include people like my husband, with criminal records, as part of the moratorium,” she asked through a translator.</p>
      <p>Warren apologized to the woman for the “troubles” she and her family have experienced and said she is open to “suspending deportations” as a way to force Congress to act on immigration reform.</p>
      <p>“I am open to suspending deportations, particularly as a way to push Congress for comprehensive immigration reform,” Warren stated.</p>
      <p>“I believe that what we’re doing right now with ICE, focusing on people who do not pose a threat, that when ICE comes into our communities, takes our neighbors, our friends, our family members, that they do not make this country safer,” she continued.</p>
      <p>“We need ICE and Customs and Border Control to focus on real threats,” she continued, citing terrorism and fentanyl as examples:</p>

      <p>Warren’s idea <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/07/bernie-immigration-plan-stop-racist-and-ineffective-wall-freeze-deportations-extend-entitlement-benefits-to-illegal-aliens/">parallels</a> Sanders’, whose immigration plan features a proposal to freeze deportations.</p>
      <p>The socialist senator <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/welcoming-and-safe-america-all/">proposes</a> to “institute a moratorium on deportations until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete” and “dismantle” what he describes as “cruel and inhumane deportation programs.”</p>
