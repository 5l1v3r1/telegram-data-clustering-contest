      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a> is apparently not a big fan of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-returns">Popeyes</a>’ much sought-after chicken sandwich.</p>
      <p>The Canadian pop star took to Instagram Stories on Thursday to give his review of the popular food item, which has sparked long lines and a wave of violent episodes, including a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/28-year-old-man-fatally-stabbed-at-maryland-popeyes-after-fight-over-chicken-sandwich-police-confirm">deadly</a> stabbing.</p>
      <p>“It’s good but it’s not worth the hype,” the 25-year-old said in a video after a few bites.</p>
      <p>Bieber picked up three sandwiches to sample from the fast-food restaurant, according to <a href="https://people.com/food/justin-bieber-says-popeyes-chicken-sandwich-is-not-worth-the-hype/">People</a>.</p>

      <p>“I gotta see what all this hype is about,” he said. “All this hype on the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich, let me see what we got here.”</p>
      <p>The chicken sandwich may not have been a home run with the singer, but there was one thing from Popeyes that did impress him: “Sweet tea’s bangin’ though.”</p>
