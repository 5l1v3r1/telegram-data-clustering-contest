      <p>The family of Pham Thi Tra My <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50185788">said they paid £30,000 to people smugglers</a> to get her to the UK.</p>
      <p>Miss Tra My, who was from Vietnam's Ha Tinh province, flew to China before travelling via France and Belgium, according to her brother.</p>
      <p>He told the BBC she first attempted to cross the border to the UK on 19 October but was caught and turned back.</p>
      <p>The last message the family received from her was at 22:30 BST on 22 October - two hours before the trailer arrived at the Purfleet terminal from Zeebrugge in Belgium.</p>
      <p>The texts, sent to her parents, read: "I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed.</p>
      <p>"I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother."</p>
      <h3>Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20</h3>

      <p>Among the youngest of the victims, Mr Hung was also from Ha Tinh. He wanted to join his parents who live in the UK, his brother told local media.</p>
      <p>His sister asked for help to find him in a Facebook post after the lorry was discovered. She wrote that he flew from Hanoi to Russia on 26 August, then to France on 6 October, but that the family lost contact when he went to the UK on 21 October.</p>

      <p>A friend who lives in Glasgow did not want to be identified, but<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-50197691"> told the BBC he had been due to meet up</a> with Miss Tho - who was from Nghe An province - when she arrived in the UK.</p>
      <p>Her eyes are blurred in this image at the request of her family.</p>
      <h3>Bui Thi Nhung, 19</h3>

      <p>Bui Thi Nhung left her job in a clothes shop in Nghe An province to travel to the UK using money that her friends had helped her raise.</p>
      <p>Once there Miss Nhung, who was also known as Anna, hoped to meet up with friends and family, and to work to pay off debt owed by her late father.</p>
      <p>She was the youngest of four siblings - and the most educated - <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-50203096">her sister Bui Thi Loan told the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>The sisters had exchanged messages on Facebook on 21 October, when Miss Nhung said she was fine and "in storage".</p>
      <h3>Vo Ngoc Nam, 28</h3>
      <p>Originally from Nghe An province, Mr Nam had been working in Romania and planned to travel to the UK. His family did not want to be interviewed.</p>

      <p>Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-50196096/vietnamese-man-s-son-feared-dead-in-lorry-incident">borrowed thousands of pounds</a> when he was discharged from the military in order to get married and build a house.</p>
      <p>But with no work available in his hometown in Nghe An province, he went abroad to seek employment and repay his debts, leaving behind his wife and 18-month-old baby.</p>
      <p>Mr Tu paid smugglers the equivalent of around £4,960 in the hope of making it to the UK, according to AFP news agency.</p>
      <h3>Le Van Ha, 30</h3>

      <p>Le Van Ha left his heavily pregnant wife and young son behind in Nghe An province when he began his journey to the UK in June.</p>
      <p>He went in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-50203096">search of better-paid work to repay money</a> that his family had borrowed to build their house.</p>
      <p>His father, Le Minh Tuan, mortgaged two plots of land to fund the £20,000 journey.</p>
      <p>"I don't know when we can ever pay it back. I'm an old man now, my health is poor, and I have to help bring up his children," he said.</p>
      <h3>Nguyen Van Hung, 33</h3>

      <p>Less than two weeks before his body was found in Essex, Nguyen Van Hung was photographed with his cousin, Hoang Van Tiep, at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.</p>
      <p>The music graduate had tricked his parents when he left Nghe An to join his cousin in France last year, leaving his passport at home and travelling on a different one.</p>
      <p>He found work in a kitchen but had spoken about how it was hard, and said he wanted to grow marijuana in the UK.</p>
      <h3>Hoang Van Tiep, 18</h3>

      <p>Hoang Van Tiep, Nguyen Van Hung's cousin, left Nghe An province for France in 2017, funded by his mother, who borrowed money from banks and relatives to fund the trip.</p>
      <p>Once there, he worked illegally at a restaurant, his mother said. He was arrested multiple times and his passport was taken.</p>
      <p>On being threatened with deportation, he told his mother he wanted to travel to the UK.</p>
      <h3>Nguyen Trong Thai, 26</h3>
      <p>Having worked in his family's timber business, Mr Thai had often talked about leaving Nghe An province and going abroad.</p>
      <p>He told his family he was going to Germany for business, his mother told the BBC. But after several phone calls in the first few days, they stopped hearing from him.</p>
      <h3>Nguyen Ba Vu Hung, 34</h3>
      <p>Mr Hung, who was from Thua Thien - Hue province, had been speaking to his family about trying to get to the UK in mid-October, according to his brother-in-law, Tom Wright, who is a US citizen but lives with his wife in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>Believing that he would have a better life in the UK, Mr Hung's mother agreed to pay the estimated $15,000 (£11,800).</p>
      <p>He was in regular contact with his family while travelling through Europe, sending a photo of himself and a friend in front of the Eiffel Tower. He told his mother that he would be boarding a truck and would contact her in a few days, once he had reached the UK - but he never did.</p>
      <h3>Vo Nhan Du, 19</h3>
      <p>Mr Du left his home in Ha Tinh province in June, staying in Germany for 15 days and France for three months, his <a href="https://vnexpress.net/thoi-su/nhieu-gia-dinh-nhan-tin-con-tu-nan-trong-container-tu-anh-4006404.html">father told Vietnamese media.</a></p>
      <p>The last his father heard from him was on 22 October, when he called to say he was about to leave for the UK.</p>
