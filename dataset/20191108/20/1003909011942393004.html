      <h1>Large windows highlight the best of Boulevard</h1>

      <p>With well-sized windows in all the right places, a new townhome by StreetSide Developments fills with sunshine.</p>
      <p>The Boulevard is a three-level, 1,398-square-foot model with a tandem garage displayed as a show home at Belwood Park, a development in the southeast community of Belmont.</p>
      <p>Its use of windows create numerous bright, inviting spaces while lessening the need to reach for a light switch.</p>
      <p>Every key space on the main level has at least one window — including the great room — which glows with two substantial panes on the front-facing wall and one on a side wall.</p>
      <p>With direct access to a balcony, the great room feels extended. At six feet seven inches by 16 feet two inches, this outdoor space is ideal for everything from great conversations with family or friends, to a morning coffee in the fresh air.</p>
      <p>The rear-facing U-shaped kitchen has a pantry, tile backsplash, and stainless-steel appliances, including an over-the-range hoodfan. Its counter facing the dining area has an extended eating bar that comfortably seats three people.</p>

      <p>While the front and back of a home are common spots for windows, it’s the side walls, such as the over-sized pane facing the central dining area, that help set this layout apart.</p>
      <p>This enhances the overall flow of light across its open-concept main level, while highlighting the space in which families share a meal and reconnect after a day of school or work.</p>
      <p>To that end, the dining area boxes out, adding to its visual interest.</p>
      <p>Flooring across the main level is a durable and stylish luxury vinyl plank.</p>
      <p>With three bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms, this model fits the needs of a young family. It also works for a downsizing couple who wants the space to host grandchildren for the weekend. Belwood Park’s other show home, the 1,153-square-foot Avenue model, has two bedrooms.</p>
      <p>The largest bedroom measures 10 feet six inches by 12 feet and features an ensuite and spacious walk-in closet. Continuing the home’s focus on natural light, it benefits from a generously sized window on its main wall and a transom window on another.</p>
      <p>The larger of the two secondary bedrooms — which also has a walk-in closet — boasts windows on multiple walls, as well.</p>
      <p>Conveniently positioned just outside the master bedroom is a laundry area with a stacked front-load washer and dryer. This location avoids the need for any members of the family to carry a basket and laundry up and down stairs.</p>
      <p>Joining Pine Creek and Sirocco, Belmont is one of three new master-planned communities by Anthem United located west of Macleod Trail.</p>
      <p>The community — planned to be home to a future City of Calgary recreation centre — is near an established shopping complex in Silverado, and a large retail development that includes a movie theatre in Shawnessy.</p>
      <p>Soccer and equestrian enthusiasts will appreciate Belmont’s close proximity to Spruce Meadows.</p>
