      <p>The Met said a group had gathered at the venue when a fight broke out. The 18-year-old was taken to hospital but died an hour later.</p>
      <p>A 17-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of murder remains in custody.</p>

      <p>He was praised by detectives for "bravely" trying to break up the fight.</p>

      <p>In a statement, Mr Sillah's family described him as "a lovely lad who cared about his family".</p>
      <p>"He loved looking after his little brother, who had been ill," they said.</p>
      <p>Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh described the attack as "an absolute tragedy" and praised the teenager who tried to stop the fight.</p>
      <p>"A young man with his whole life ahead of him has been fatally attacked and his family are absolutely devastated," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are doing everything we can to find those involved.</p>
      <p>"What we know so far is that a fight broke out between males at the location and as a result this young man received fatal injuries.</p>
      <p>"A second independent male, bravely tried to intervene to break up the fight and as a result was also stabbed."</p>

      <p>Hillingdon Council said it was "offering support and counselling" to any of its employees affected.</p>
      <p>It is the second murder investigation to be launched in Hillingdon this year - after Tashan Daniel was stabbed to death at Hillingdon Tube Station on 24 September.</p>
      <p>Mr Daniel's family plans to organise a march in central London on 7 December to raise awareness of the impact of knife crime.</p>
