      <p><b>SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Students and faculty at the University of Rhode Island are upset that the school hasn't changed more bathroom signs to be gender neutral.</p>
      <p>The Providence Journal reports more than 20 students, faculty and staff demonstrated in the university quad Thursday.</p>
      <p>The school agreed in 2013 to post gender-neutral signs at single-person restrooms around campus.</p>
      <p>Abigail Rider, vice president for administration and finances, says the school has changed the signs on 14 bathrooms on campus.</p>
      <p>Rider told demonstrators she's not sure what has caused the administration's delays but "there is no institutional resistance to this initiative."</p>
      <p>The school sent a campus-wide email shortly before the demonstration saying that 200 signs would be placed around camps by the end of the current academic year.</p>
