      <p>Tsepo Masilela returns to top-flight after signing a deal with an Absa Premiership club. </p>
      <p>After spending some time training with AmaZulu, Masilela has been offered a deal by the KwaZulu-Natal club, having impressed the team’s head coach Jozef Vukusic in training. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Masilela, 34, has been without a club since he parted ways with Chiefs at the end of the 2017/18 season. </p>
      <p>The left-back becomes the second high-profile signing for Usuthu after the club signed another former Chiefs defender in Mario Booysen over two weeks ago.  </p>
      <p>AmaZulu are 10th on the log with three wins from their 10 matches. </p>
