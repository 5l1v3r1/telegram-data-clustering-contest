      <p>MADRID: Spain have recalled Alvaro Morata for their Euro 2020 qualifiers against Malta and Romania after the striker scored five times in his last five games for Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>Spain, who have already qualified for next year's championship, need to avoid defeat in one of their two remaining games in order to progress as Group F winners.</p>

      <p>There was a maiden call up for Dani Olmo, however Barcelona's Ansu Fati and Arsenal's Dani Ceballos missed out.</p>
      <p>Zagreb forward Olmo, who was a key part of the Spain Under-21 side that won this year’s European Championship, has impressed for the Croatian side in the Champions League this season.</p>
      <p>The squad contains just five players from Spain’s so-called ‘big three’ sides - Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.</p>
