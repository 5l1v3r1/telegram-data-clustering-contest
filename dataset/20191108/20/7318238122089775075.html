      <p>Thirty years ago, the Berlin Wall - which had divided the city, the country, and Europe for decades - collapsed.</p>
      <p>Euronews recalls November 9, 1989 and the importance that the reunification of Berlin had for the continent.</p>
      <p>Across Berlin, chisels were sold out as people went to take a little piece of the wall, says Sigrid Ulrich, a Euronews journalist in Germany.</p>
      <p>"The Easterners, they also came with their hammers," he remembers, "they had big hammers and they just worked out their aggression against this wall."</p>
      <p>"If you once heard it once, you would never forget it," he says.</p>
      <p>Elena Karaeva, a Euronews journalist in Russia, explains that few Russians were expecting such a dramatic turn of events.</p>
      <p>"We realised, something was about to happen, but we couldn’t even imagine it would be the fall of the wall, that’s how unwavering it seemed," she says.</p>
      <p>"We had no idea about anything. We didn’t know that West Berlin was under blockade in the 40s, we didn’t know Kennedy arrived there and said 'I am a Berliner'."</p>
