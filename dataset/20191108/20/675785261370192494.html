      <p>Four men 'blew up' a vulnerable homeless man in Liverpool in a vile prank.</p>
      <p>The sick footage shows a man in a wheelchair surrounded by two hooded thugs who light what appears to be a rocket firework and force it into the homeless man's hand.</p>
      <p>After lighting the firework the grimacing thug turns and runs.</p>
      <p>The homeless man can be seen leaning forward from his wheelchair - in what appears to be a move to protect himself from the blazing rocket.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, the firework explodes in the man’s hand.</p>

      <p>The shocking footage has recently been shared on social media after initially emerging on Snapchat, with the owner of the video commenting ‘I can’t believe he blew himself up’.</p>
      <p>The attack took place in central Liverpool close to the city’s main station Liverpool Lime Street.</p>
      <p>Michelle Langan runs the Papercup project that works with the man in the wheelchair regularly.</p>
      <p>She said: "It’s so sad to see a vulnerable person being used for laughs like this.</p>

      <p>"Our team sees this man every week, and its horrifying to see him put in danger like this...</p>
      <p>"Its not funny, its not a joke. This prank on the video could have easily ended in tragedy - homeless people should not be treated as objects to laugh at or be taken advantage of.</p>
      <p>Ms Langan raised concerns over the younger generation taking extreme risks for the sake of gaining popularity on social media.</p>
