      <blockquote>"Sixty-nine Palestinians have been injured today in clashes with the Israeli troops on the border of the Gaza Strip, 29 of them have received gunshot wounds", Qidra said.</blockquote>
      <p>The march's committee has announced that next week demonstrators would chant slogans in support of extending the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East's mandate.</p>
      <p>On 1 November, Palestinians held <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201909201076854267-at-least-74-palestinians-injured-in-clashes-with-israeli-troops-on-friday/">protests near the Gaza border</a>, timed to an anniversary of the release of the British government’s Balfour Declaration, published on 2 November 1917. The document expressed support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" within the Ottoman Empire's region of Palestine.</p>
      <p>The protest led to clashes with the Israeli forces. Ninety-six <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201909231076872032-at-least-10-palestinians-wounded-during-clashes-in-west-bank---health-ministry/">Palestinians have been injured in the violence</a>.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations, known as the Great March of Return, have been ongoing for 82 weeks and resulted in 314 deaths since 30 March 2018. The protesters demand to be able to return to their ancestral homes, which, according to them, were seized by Israel.</p>
      <p>One of the main goals of the Palestinian side is to restore the border between Israel and the Palestinian Authority to where it was before the 1967 Six-Day War, with a possible territorial exchange. Palestinians hope to create their state on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel, on its part, is hostile to the idea of restoring previous borders and is even more hostile to the idea of sharing Jerusalem, which they consider to be their eternal and undivided capital.</p>
