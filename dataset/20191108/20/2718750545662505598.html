        <i>Marriage Story</i>
      </h4>
      <p>As Noah Baumbach’s divorce drama begins its pre-Netflix theatrical run this weekend, critics are hailing the film as one of the year’s best. <i>Marriage Story</i> seems sure to score in the acting categories, but could it make waves in Best Picture as well? The film wrings a lot of knowing chuckles from industry viewers, and such broad relatability could boost it in the preferential ballot. One potential snag: Oscar voters typically like to send a message with their top picks, and finding that sort of angle for <i>Marriage Story</i> will be a challenge.</p>

        <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i>
      </h4>
      <p>For a would-be Oscar contender that comes out in two weeks, it sure seems like few pundits are talking about this movie outside of Tom Hanks’s performance. <i>Beautiful Day</i> was <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-review-tiff-2019.html">well received at TIFF</a>, so what’s behind the lack of buzz? Is it the film’s soft and gentle vibe, which isn’t spurring the passion a <i>Parasite</i> or <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> engenders? Or, after <i>Won’t You Be My Neighbor</i>, are people simply Mr. Rogers-ed out?</p>

      <h4>Noah Baumbach, <i>Marriage Story</i></h4>
      <p>“Noah Baumbach’s latest will win over even those who don’t love Noah Baumbach,” writes <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/10/marriage-story-review-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-movie.html">Slate’s Dana Stevens</a>, a compliment/insult calzone that would be right at home in <i>Marriage Story</i>. Baumbach’s tonally dexterous efforts seem likely to land him his first directing nomination, though he’ll have tough competition from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/oscars-predictions-little-women-ford-v-ferrari.html">inside his own household</a>.</p>

      <h4>Alma Har’el, <i>Honey Boy</i></h4>
      <p>The Israeli filmmaker’s feature debut is filled with moving performances and arresting visual imagery, though <i>Honey Boy</i> is so linked to the outsize figure of writer/co-star Shia LaBeouf, who based the film on his own childhood, that voters may overlook Har’el’s contributions.</p>

      <h4>Adam Driver, <i>Marriage Story</i></h4>
      <p><i>Marriage Story </i>is such a critics’ fave that pundits are starting to slate Driver as this category’s new front-runner ahead of Joaquin Phoenix. I’m not ready to go there yet — Phoenix has the track record, and the transformation, on his side — but the pair do feel like <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/oscars-2020-best-actor-predictions.html">this extremely competitive category</a>’s only two locks</p>

      <h4>Noah Jupe, <i>Honey Boy</i></h4>
      <p>How darkly ironic that <i>Honey Boy</i>, a movie about the horrors of child acting, should launch a great new child actor. The 14-year-old Jupe has been getting raves for his precocious performance as the LaBeouf stand-in, with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/honey-boy-review-shia-labeouf-907711/">Peter Travers</a> calling him “astounding.” With a small turn in <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> coming up, as well, the young Brit is one to watch.</p>

      <h4>Scarlett Johansson,<i> Marriage Story</i></h4>
      <p>I’ve seen critics question whether the storytelling in <i>Marriage Story</i> is really as balanced between Driver and Johansson as initially appears, but that doesn’t discount how great the actress is in the scenes she does get. <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/10/marriage-story-review-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-movie.html">Stevens</a> calls her and Driver “superb performers, attentive, generous, versatile, and able to register minute shifts of feeling and understanding on their admittedly well-proportioned features.” These raves will have to speak for themselves: After her recent PR kerfuffles, the gun-shy Johansson is letting her co-stars do the bulk of the gladhanding.</p>

      <h4>Cynthia Erivo, <i>Harriet</i></h4>
      <p>With her Harriet Tubman biopic earning only polite respect from critics, Erivo needed audiences to show up to keep some wind in her sails. That’s exactly what happened, with <i>Harriet</i> debuting to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/awards-box-office-harriet-shines-12m-nationwide-debut-1251887">a solid opening weekend</a> and an A+ CinemaScore to boot. The British actress has been putting in work on the circuit, too, as voters have come away charmed by her ebullient presence.</p>

      <h4>Ray Liotta, <i>Marriage Story</i></h4>
      <p>I’ve mentioned Alan Alda in this column before, but let’s also spare a minute for Liotta as Driver’s other attorney, who tears into his lines like they’re a bloody steak. Alongside Laura Dern as Johansson’s lawyer, the trio “collectively come close to stealing the movie,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/movies/marriage-story-review.html">A.O. Scott</a> writes, “in part because they are playing performers fully in their element.” Individually, the two men probably lack the screen time to mount a showing in this category. It’s a pity they can’t fuse themselves into one contender, Ralan Aldotta.</p>
