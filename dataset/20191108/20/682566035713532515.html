      <p>Lyon - Former France international <b>Mathieu Bastareaud </b>said on Friday he not is joining <b>New York's Rugby United</b> just to go on 'holiday'.</p>
      <p>Bastareaud, 31, who retired from Test rugby after being left out of les Bleus' World Cup squad, is heading to the US after his final game with Lyon this weekend.</p>
      <p>He joined the French club on a temporary deal as cover during the tournament from Toulon after making his senior debut as a 19-year-old with Stade Francais.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to New York for a holiday. I'm a competitor. I'm going there to be at the top of my game and to win something," he said.</p>
      <p>"I want to have a new experience in an unknown country. I've only been there once and that was to sign my contract.</p>
      <p>"I've played in the Top 14 for 12 years. I started quite young. It's a lot of pressure, a lot energy," he added.</p>
      <p>The 54-time international, who will feature for the Barbarians against Fiji on November 17 before crossing the Atlantic, said playing in Major League Rugby will be a drop in standard.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of ambition to develop rugby in the US, and why not host a World Cup? I'm going there with a lot curiosity," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'm not expecting the same quality as the Top 14 or the European Cup. They like to play a lot, like in Super Rugby, but at a lower quality."</p>
      <p>The powerful ball-carrier has changed position during his time at Lyon having played six matches at No. 8 after a career as a centre.</p>
      <p>"The fact of discovering a new position has changed my job in the space of four months. Playing with the forwards is totally different," he said.</p>
      <p>"In the backs, we're used to shouting at the forwards when they forget things. I understand better now. I'm happy with what I've done in the position."</p>
      <p>New Zealand's two-time World Cup winner Ma'a Nonu will also play in the 12-team MLR after having signed a deal with the San Diego Legion, with the new season starting in early February.</p>
