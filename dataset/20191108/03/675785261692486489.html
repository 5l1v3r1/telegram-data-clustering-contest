      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr has warned Tyson Fury over his move into WWE wrestling, saying: 'Don't stay away too long from boxing.'</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andy-ruiz-jr">Ruiz Jr</a> also said he wants to fight Fury when the lineal heavyweight champion is ready to return to the boxing ring.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/andy-ruiz-jr-explains-weight-20837912">Next month</a> Ruiz Jr faces <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/anthony-joshua">Anthony Joshua</a> in a rematch of their June world heavyweight title fight, in which the Mexican American stunned boxing by taking his opponents' belts.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Fury</a> will appear on Friday Night Smackdown in his hometown Manchester tonight, having knocked out Braun Strowman on his WWE debut at the Crown Jewel pay-per-view event in Saudi Arabia last week.</p>
      <p>Asked about Fury's move into WWE, Ruiz warned the Gypsy King that his timing might be off when he eventually returns to boxing.</p>

      <p>"You know what, I think that's a good opportunity for him (Fury) because boxing's not forever," Ruiz told IFL TV.</p>
      <p>"I don't really have nothing bad to say about him even though he talks crap about everyone else.</p>
      <p>"I'm a humble guy, I treat everyone the same.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> , I think that's a good move for him, but just don't stay away too long from boxing.</p>

      <p>"I don't know, the timing, all that, might be a little bit different when he goes back inside the ring."</p>
      <p>Fury is due for a huge rematch with WBC heavyweight champion <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> on February 22 next year.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr was asked about wanting to fight Fury in the past - and said he would be just as happy to face him again after defending his belts against Joshua next month.</p>
      <p>"Seven years ago [he wanted to fight him], because he was the one that was top of the game," said Ruiz Jr.</p>

      <p>"Everyone was scared to fight him just because he was big and long, difficult.</p>
      <p>"But with my style, I make every style difficult because of my speed, the movement, because I'm short.</p>
