      <h1>Would <i>Scream 5</i> Be a Good Idea?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T03:11:54+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 03:11</time> by <a rel="author">Bethy Squires</a></address>
      <p>Just because <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/courteney-cox-cuts-bangs-like-her-scream-3-character-watch.html">Courtney Cox is cutting her bangs again</a> does <i>not </i>mean you have to make a new <i>Scream </i>movie. A fifth <i>Scream </i>movie is in the works at Spyglass, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/scream-5-in-early-development-spyglass-1202780706/">multiple</a> <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3593128/spyglass-resurrection-ghostface-new-scream-exclusive/">outlets.</a> This <i>Scream</i> would be without the participation of Wes Craven (deceased) or Kevin Williamson (disinterested), which begs the question: so then what makes it a <i>Scream </i>movie? Meta humor? Every movie has that now. The ghostface mask? MTV’s <i>Scream </i>show didn’t even have that for the first two seasons. The inclusion of “Red Right Hand” would certainly help, but turning the <i>Scream </i>tetralogy into a pentology is a tricky proposition.</p>
      <p>A new <i>Scream </i>would have to maintain the series’ oddly prescient gender politics that saw #MeToo coming. These movies are horror, but also mystery, because you truly don’t know which man in your life is secretly trying to murder you. Sidney Prescott famously defied Final Girl rules by losing her virginity in the first film. And <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjgx7q/the-weinstein-esque-character-you-missed-in-the-weinstein-produced-scream-3"><i>Scream 3 </i>hinted at Harvey Weinstein’s misdeeds</a> before even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/16/entertainment/courtney-love-harvey-weinstein/index.html">Courtney Love</a> was talking about it.</p>
      <p>There are no details yet on whether the potential <i>Scream 5 </i>would be a revival, reboot, or prequel. It is also not known whether any OG cast members will return, or if the movie would have anything as funny as the Sarah Koenig-esque podcaster from the MTV series. Here’s hoping.</p>
