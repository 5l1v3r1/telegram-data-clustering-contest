      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): China-based Tencent Holdings Ltd is collaborating with Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover Global Network (including Diners Club) and JCB to enable overseas users to link their credit cards to WeChat Pay and use it for payment transactions and services in China.</p>
      <p>In a statement Nov 7, Tencent said with this collaboration, overseas users will now be able to use WeChat Pay across multiple payment scenarios spanning shopping, restaurants, transportation and accommodation.</p>
      <p>The firm said in recent years, more and more overseas visitors are travelling to mainland China and some have chosen to stay and work here.</p>
      <p>Citing the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism, it said the number of inbound tourists reached 141.2 million in 2018, an increase of 1.2% over the same period of the previous year.</p>
      <p>Tencent said that currently, there are more than 950,000 foreigners working in China, and the country has cumulatively issued 336,000 overseas talent work permits in 2018.</p>
      <p>It said the Chinese government has introduced a variety of policies to bring convenience to their daily lives, something which WeChat Pay is committed to helping achieve through quality of life enhancing innovation.</p>
      <p>“WeChat Pay is already supporting overseas users with mainland bank cards, savings cards and credit cards from up to 128 available banks registered with their passports.</p>
      <p>“Users simply enter their bank card number, name, ID number and the mobile phone number for binding their bank cards in a few easy steps to enjoy the convenience of WeChat Pay,” it said.</p>
      <p>Tencent said it intends to continue exploring further innovative collaboration with all industry parties under the guidance of the relevant regulatory authorities to provide more convenience for overseas users both traveling and living in mainland China.</p>
