      <p>In light of the release of his upcoming 1st full album '<b>Thinking Part.2</b>', <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/block-b">Block B</a>'s <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/zico">Zico</a> shared some of his behind stories, thoughts, and feelings via a press interview. </p>
      <p>Block B recently garnered attention for gathering together once again, making news headlines. Zico recalled the gathering and shared, <i>"<b>Taeil</b> hyung came out for one of his vacations, so we all met up. They liked '<b>Human</b>' the best, they said. If I ask the members after I release albums, they give me good feedback, but it's true that we're not really the type of people to contact each other without any reasons (Laughter)." </i></p>
      <p>When asked to pick songs from his album to suggest to the general public, Zico chose "<b>Not That Person</b>" and "<b>Flower Language</b>". He reasoned, <i>"I can confidently say that 'Not That Person' is a song with high production quality. On the other hand, 'Flower Language' is a part of my ballad series, following 'It Was Love' and 'Flower Road'. I worked hard on the production. People who enjoy listening to ballads will like this one." </i></p>
      <p>Zico's 'Thinking Part.2' is set for release this November 8 at 6 PM KST.</p>
