      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After a decent upward move above $190, Ethereum struggled to continue higher against the US Dollar. As a result, ETH started a downward move and broke the $190 support area.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there was a break below the $188 support area and the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/07/ethereum-eth-forming-bearish-pattern-186-hold-key/">this week’s major bullish trend line</a> was breached with support near $189 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>The price is now trading near the $185 support area, with a few bearish signs. Additionally, it is trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $195 high to $185 swing low.</p>
      <p>An immediate resistance is near the $188 level. Moreover, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $188 on the same chart. If there is an upside break above the trend line, Ethereum could test the $190 resistance area.</p>
      <p>Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $195 high to $185 swing low is also near the $190 level. Therefore, a successful break above the $188 and $190 resistance levels is must for a fresh increase in the near term.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $185 level. If there is a bearish break and close below the $185 support area, the price may perhaps accelerate its decline below $184 and $182. The next key support is near the $180 level. Any further losses could lead the price towards the $175 level.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price is struggling to hold the main $185 support area. Thus, there is a risk of more downsides below $185 and $184 in the coming sessions. Conversely, the price needs to climb back above $188 and $190 to move back into a bullish zone.</p>
