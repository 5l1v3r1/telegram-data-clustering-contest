      <p>RAJKOT: After India defeated Bangladesh by eight wickets on Thursday in the second T20I of the three-match series , bowling all-rounder <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Washington-Sundar">Washington Sundar</a> said that spinners have a very important role to play in the shortest format of the game.</p>

          <b>FULL SCORECARD</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Bangladesh had managed to score just 153/6 in the allotted twenty overs and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a>'s knock of 85 runs helped India chase down the target with eight wickets in hand and 26 balls to spare. With this win, India levelled the series at 1-1, with one match to play.</p>
      <p>"If Rohit bats like this, then it is a treat to watch him. He was on song today and it was very good to watch," Sundar told reporters.</p>
      <p>"Spinners have a big role to play in the shortest format of the game as they take the pace away from the ball. It is all about knowing what to do. Small things matter. Yes you will get hit in some games, this can happen, but spinners have an important role in the T20 format," said the young all-rounder.</p>
      <p>"We thought 180 was a par score on this wicket. Restricting them to 153, as a bowling unit, we did an excellent job. We were lucky with the toss in this game. We thought anywhere around 160 was a good score to restrict Bangladesh to. Spinners' role was very important on this wicket and it was very important to vary the pace," he added.</p>
      <p>Mohammad Naim and Mahmudullah's knocks of 36 and 30 respectively had enabled Bangladesh to post a score of 153/6 in the allotted 20 overs.</p>
      <p>Yuzvendra Chahal took two wickets for India and he was the key bowler as he put a hold on Bangladesh's run-rate. Sundar took just one wicket but he managed to strangle Bangladesh batsmen with his off-spin bowling.</p>
      <p>"Chahal knows what batsmen are trying to do," Sundar continued. "He is very clever. He has played a lot of IPL games, so he is calm and composed under pressure. "</p>
      <p>Bangladesh had defeated India on Sunday by seven wickets in the first T20I of the three-match series. It was Bangladesh's first over India in the shortest format of the game.</p>
      <p>"We have just lost one game. A couple of things here and there, and we could have won that game (first ODI) as well," Sundar added.</p>
      <p>"We won this match quite comprehensively, now we will definitely look to win the series. Chahal is very experienced in this format and he knows what to do to take wickets in the middle overs. He is definitely an asset for any team he plays for."</p>
      <p>India and Bangladesh will next lock horns in the final T20I of the series on Sunday in Nagpur.</p>
