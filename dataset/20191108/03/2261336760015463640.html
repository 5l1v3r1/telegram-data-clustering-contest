      <p>Nate Diaz willed into existence one of the most historic events in UFC history and it may have been his swan song.</p>
      <p>UFC 244 suffered from a disappointing ending to some, as Jorge Masvidal was <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/3/20945632/ufc-244-ppv-results-masvidal-outclasses-diaz-gets-controversial-doctor-stoppage-mma-news">awarded a third-round doctor stoppage victory</a> due to a cut over Diaz’s left eye. Both Masvidal and Diaz <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/3/20945721/ufc-244-masvidal-vs-diaz-post-fight-press-conference-live-stream-bmf">called for a rematch</a>, although UFC President Dana White seemed hesitant. Diaz, 34, suggested that the establishment was again looking to undermine him. Those feelings may not have changed as Diaz seemingly announced his retirement on Thursday.</p>

      <p>“F—k a rematch this s—t was over before it started,” Diaz captioned a black-and-white Instagram photo of himself smoking a joint next to brother Nick Diaz. “I’m goin on out on tour. Peace out fight game ✌ ”</p>
      <p>The post generated support from comedian Michael Rapaport and American rock band Portgual. The Man.</p>

      <p>Masvidal has called for a rematch with Diaz or <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/4/20947950/ufc-244-mma-news-interview-boxing-jorge-masvidal-canelo-alvarez-fight-new-york-nate-diaz">a superfight with boxing great Canelo Alvarez</a>. It would seem likely the UFC would pursue a title bout between Masvidal and the winner of UFC 245’s Kamaru Usman vs. Colby Covington.</p>
