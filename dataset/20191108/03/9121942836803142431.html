      <p>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian media are reporting that Iran’s air defense force has shot down an “unknown” drone in the country’s southwest.</p>
      <p>The state-run IRNA news agency said Friday that air defense forces hit the drone earlier in the morning at the port city of Mahshahr, which is in the oil-rich Khuzestan province and lies on the Persian Gulf.</p>
      <p>The report did not say whether the drone was a military or commercially available device.</p>
      <p>It said Iranian defense forces are searching the area for parts of the downed drone.</p>
      <p>In June, Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran said the drone “violated” its territorial airspace, while the U.S. called the missile fire “an unprovoked attack” in international airspace over the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf.</p>
