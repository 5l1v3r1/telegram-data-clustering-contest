      <h1>Liverpool escape punishment over racist Divock Origi banner</h1>
      <h2>Club have reportedly avoided any sanction after UEFA match official did not include incident in his report following Reds' 4-1 Champions League win over Genk</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T03:02:26+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 03:02</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool appear to have escaped any sanction over the racist banner depicting Divock Origi after it was claimed the UEFA match delegate did not report it.</p>
      <p>The Reds' 4-1 Champions League win over Genk last month was marred when an obscene banner was unfurled in the stands depicting a mocked-up picture of a naked Origi with an abnormally large penis next to the Champions League trophy.</p>
      <p>Liverpool staff had the banner removed before the game started, with the club branding it "highly offensive and inappropriate" after confirming they had it taken down.</p>
      <p>And last week the club banned the fan who took the banner into the ground.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> spokesperson said at the time: "Liverpool Football Club condemns the offensive banner displayed in our section of the ground, prior to kick-off.</p>

      <p>"To be clear, the image used perpetuated a racist stereotype. This is completely unacceptable.</p>
      <p>"We acted swiftly to have the banner removed and we are now working with the local authorities and stadium team in Genk to identify those responsible.</p>
      <p>"Any subsequent action will be taken in keeping with our sanctions process."</p>
      <p>Liverpool have not faced any action from European football's governing body, and it has now emerged that the UEFA match delegate did not include the incident in his report, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10300227/liverpool-escape-punishment-for-racist-origi-banner/">The Sun</a> .</p>

      <p>Moments after the offensive banner was removed Liverpool fans unveiled a banner declaring "we are not racists.</p>
      <p>That came after a series of high-profile racist incidents in football in the preceding weeks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> issued an indefinite ban to a supporter over racist abuse aimed at Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold during the fierce rivals' 1-1 draw last month.</p>
      <p>That came after England's players were subject to shocking abuse during their Euro 2020 qualifier with Bulgaria the week before.</p>

      <p>Non-league Haringey Borough also walked off the pitch during their FA Cup clash with Yeovil after their players were abused.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of examples where clubs have been hit with disciplinary proceedings over banners deemed to be offensive.</p>
      <p>Celtic were hit with a Uefa charge following their 2-1 win over Lazio last week.</p>

      <p>Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the Hoops for an "illicit banner" and "illicit chants".</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich were fined £8,600 for an offensive banner and ordered to close part of their stadium for their 2014 Champions League quarter-final against Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Ajax were fined £21,000 in 2013 for a similar offence against Celtic.</p>
