      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> Democratic presidential candidacy may be just what the party needs to challenge <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump </a>in 2020, according to a former aide to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">New York City mayor</a> and media mogul is expected to file paperwork this week designating himself as a candidate in Alabama's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">Democratic presidential primary</a>, Fox News has learned.</p>
      <p>On "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">The Ingraham Angle</a>," Christopher Hahn praised Bloomberg's three-term tenure as mayor of America's largest city -- during which he served as a Republican, a Democrat and an independent.</p>
      <p>"I think Mike Bloomberg was an excellent mayor for the city of New York," Hahn said.</p>

      <p>"He might be just what the doctor ordered to shake this thing up right now."</p>
      <p>Hahn, now a liberal radio host, said Bloomberg, 77, would shift the current <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 Democratic presidential</a> field's focus to issues important to the center of the party and people across the country.</p>
      <p>He pointed to Andy Beshear, the Democrat who claimed victory in Tuesday's Kentucky governor's race, claiming he performed well because he appealed to moderates and "bread and butter issues."</p>
      <p>In that vein, Hahn claimed Bloomberg would appeal to people who want to "shake up everything but keep what Obama built and build upon that."</p>

      <p>"That seems to be what Mike Bloomberg's message is going to be. It seems to be what the middle of the road wants in the Democratic primary right now."</p>
      <p>In response, Republican strategist Lisa Boothe claimed the true test of whether Bloomberg is serious about entering the fray will be whether he submits an application to run in New Hampshire -- home to the first-in-the-nation primary next year.</p>
      <p>She added Bloomberg may also be an interesting addition to the field, claiming former Vice President Joe Biden -- who like the ex-mayor is seen as a moderate Democrat -- has not received the grassroots donor support other candidates have.</p>
