      <p>WHDH-TV reports officials responded Thursday night to reports of a chemical reaction in the kitchen area of the Burlington restaurant where they found a male employee suffering from nausea.</p>

      <p>The employee, whose name was not released, was taken to a hospital where he later died.</p>
      <p>Two other employees and six patrons checked themselves into hospitals.</p>
      <p>A statement from the restaurant says they are "shocked and saddened" and are cooperating with the investigation.</p>
      <p>Authorities evacuated the restaurant and urged anyone who was inside at the time to get medical treatment, if needed.</p>
      <p>The restaurant will remain closed while the investigation continues.</p>
