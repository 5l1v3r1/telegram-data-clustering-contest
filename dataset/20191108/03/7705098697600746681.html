      <h1>Avengers: Endgame’s Robert Downey Jr. Gets Submitted For Oscar Nomination</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T03:33:49+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 03:33</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>Although his Iron Man tenure propelled him to the top of Hollywood’s A-list, Robert Downey Jr. has always been humble about his recent success. Perhaps this is reason he declined the chance to pursue a Best Actor Oscar for his role in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><b>Avengers: Endgame</b></a>. Regardless, it looks like Disney and Marvel have chosen to go against Downey’s wishes. <a href="https://collider.com/robert-downey-jr-avengers-endgame-oscar-chances/">Collider</a> brings word that the studios are submitting his name for consideration at next year’s Oscars ceremony after all.</p>
      <p>Rather than Best Actor in a Leading Role, Disney is pushing to have Downey nominated for Best <i>Supporting</i> Actor. What’s surprising is that Downey isn’t the only actor being submitted for consideration in this category. The studio is also launching campaigns for Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner, Josh Brolin, Paul Rudd, and Don Cheadle.</p>

      <p>Naturally, Disney will also try its luck at getting a Best Supporting Actress nomination for <b>Endgame</b>. They’ve submitted Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, and Brie Larson for consideration as well.</p>
      <p>Some of these choices are surprising, especially since a few of them averaged no more than 15 minutes of screentime. And given some of the other films generating Oscar buzz this season, the competition is going to be fierce. But as Collider notes, it’s likely that this is only being done so that no one feels left out.</p>
