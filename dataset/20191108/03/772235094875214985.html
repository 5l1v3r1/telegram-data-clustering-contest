      <p><b>Volvo Car Australia</b> has issued a recall for <b>more than 2000 vehicles</b> across the <b>2016-2019 model-year V40, S90, V90 Cross Country</b> and<b> XC90 model lines</b> fitted with diesel engines over concerns the engine intake manifold could melt.</p>
      <p>The Swedish manufacturer reports that the engine valve may leak in affected models, causing the intake manifold "to melt or deform".</p>
      <p>"If the engine intake manifold melts or deforms, there may be unusual engine operation, activation of the engine malfunction indication light, engine interruption or lack of power, or the possibility of a localised engine bay fire," <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/volvo/">Volvo</a> says in its recall notice.</p>
      <p>"If any of these were to occur, it may pose an accident or injury risk to the vehicle occupant(s) or other road users."</p>
      <p>In total, there's <b>2045 units</b> affected across the four model lines, which were available for sale between <b>1 May 2015 and 29 October 2019</b> â€“ a VIN list is available <a href="https://www.productsafety.gov.au/system/files/VIN%20list_280.xlsx">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Owners will be contacted by Volvo Car Australia in writing, and advised to contact their preferred dealer for inspection and repair.</p>
