      <h1>Nawaz must fly abroad for medical treatment: PML-N</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T03:02:44+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 03:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8754/our-correspondent-6/" target="_blank">​ Our Correspondent</a></address>
      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb has said doctors have informed former prime minister Nawaz Sharif that they have exhausted all the available options and that he now urgently needs to fly abroad for further treatment.</p>
      <p>“Doctors have declared Mian Sahib’s [Nawaz’s} state as extremely critical. Despite all possible treatments in Pakistan, his condition is not improving and his platelet level is not stabilizing,” Marriyum said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>She said the doctors’ team looking after Nawaz held an emergency meeting after his platelet count dropped to dangerous levels again. The doctors have informed Nawaz that they cannot further increase the dose of any of his medicines given their side effects.</p>
      <p>“They have informed the Sharif family that they have used all possible options,” she said.</p>
      <p>Regarding Nawaz’s plan to travel abroad, she said the decision to fly to London would be taken by Sharif family. However, we would have to get the PML-N supreme leader’s name removed from the exit control list (ECL) first, she added.</p>
      <p>The former PM was shifted to his residence at Jati Umrah from the Service Hospital on Wednesday after his daughter Maryam Nawaz, who was with him at the hospital, was released on bail. To take care of the ailing political leader, his doctors set up an intensive care unit at his residence.</p>
      <p>Talking with reference to Nawaz’s eight-week interim bail, Marriyum said the party had not yet decided whether it would approach the court to extend Nawaz’s bail period. “The government should be considerate enough to announce extending the bail on its own,” she said.</p>
      <p>She also commented on Punjab Health Minister Yasmin Rashid statement that there was no need of a genetic test for treatment of Nawaz’s disease and said: “If she [Rashid] thinks she knows better than her own government’s specialist doctors, she should put herself in the board.”</p>
