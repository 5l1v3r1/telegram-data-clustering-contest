      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House committees leading the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump released a transcript on Thursday of a closed-door deposition of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent.</p>
      <p>Kent, who is scheduled to testify publicly on Nov. 13, told congressional investigators during his deposition on Oct. 15 that a staffer to then-Vice President Joe Biden rebuffed him in 2015 when he raised concerns about the involvement of Bidenâ€™s son in Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, according to a source familiar with his testimony.</p>
