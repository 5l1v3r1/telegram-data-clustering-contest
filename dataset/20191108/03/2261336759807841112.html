      <p>Full disclosure, the KSI vs. Logan Paul rematch is a big deal, and we are covering this event whether you like it or not. There are also legitimate boxers — WBO super-middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders and WBC lightweight champion Devin Haney — who are on the undercard, so it’s nothing like the first KSI vs. Logan Paul encounter.</p>
      <p>Now with that out of the way, the two social media stars are scheduled to fight each other in the professional ranks, meaning no headgear and ten-ounce gloves. They had a press conference on Thursday to promote Saturday’s grudge match, and they traded back-and-forth barbs as you might expect.</p>

      <p>Matchroom Boxing, which is promoting the show, has provided fans with a special video showing KSI and Logan Paul getting into a uh... heated confrontation during their very long staredown. This included Logan Paul telling KSI, “You’re tinier than I thought.” Frankly, “Do you have medical insurance?” is one of the finest bits of trash-talking I think I’ve ever heard. KSI eventually shoves Logan Paul in the middle of Logan asking a mathematical problem, which perhaps means we’ll never know how much 10x10 really is.</p>

      <p>KSI vs. Logan Paul 2 is scheduled for six rounds in the cruiserweight division. The card streams live on DAZN from 7 PM ET/4 PM PT, with main card action beginning at 9 PM ET/6 PM PT from Staples Center in Los Angeles, California.</p>
