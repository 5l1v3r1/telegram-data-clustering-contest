        <b>The cyclone “Bulbul” has gathered more strength to intensify into a Severe Cyclonic Storm over the Bay of Bengal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is likely to intensify further and move in a north-northwesterly direction, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department warned in a special bulletin on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>It was situated around 700 to 800 kilometres off the maritime ports at midnight.</p>
      <p>Gusty or squally wind may affect the maritime ports, North Bay and coastal areas under the peripheral influence of the storm, the Met Office said.</p>
      <p>The sea will remain very rough near the centre of the storm with maximum sustained wind speed of up to 110 kilometres per hour.</p>
      <p>The Met Office raised the warning level at the maritime ports to Local Cautionary Signal No. 3 from 2.</p>
      <p>All fishing boats and trawlers over North Bay have been advised to take shelter immediately and remain in shelter till further notice.</p>

      <p>The Met Office will raise the warning level to No. 4 on Friday morning if the cyclone gathers more strength, Senior Meteorologist Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>It is likely to reach the North Bay on Sunday, he said.</p>
      <p>“The coastal areas are likely to experience light rains as water vapour level has risen due to the storm,” he added.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists said rains are also likely in India’s Odisha and West Bengal coasts under the influence of the storm.</p>
      <p>They could not confirm its pathway yet.</p>

      <p>Brewed as tropical cyclone “Matmo”, it made landfall on Vietnam by the end of October before weakening to a low. It gathered strength again and changed direction later to become cyclone “Bulbul” on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The Indian Meteorological Office said it is likely to turn into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm by Friday afternoon with maximum sustained wind speed of 145kmph. It will weaken and may become a Severe Cyclonic Storm on Sunday before turning into a Cyclonic Storm on Monday.</p>

      <p>It is very likely to re-curve northeastwards and cross West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts between Sagar Islands in West Bengal and Khepupara in Bangladesh on Sunday afternoon, the Indian Met Office said.</p>
      <p>The Joint Typhoon Warning Centre said the storm may enter Bangladesh on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Abdul Mannan said the Bangladesh Met Office will raise the warning signal further after watching the situation on Saturday night as they are not certain about its possible pathway.</p>
