      <h1>'A bit like Airbnb': Prototype app unveiled to ease trespassing law concerns</h1>
      <h2>Pilot testing for an app connecting hunters and rural landowners is already underway in the RM of Shellbrook, with developers aiming for a public roll-out there in time for the 2020 hunting season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T01:04:22+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 01:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>A Saskatchewan tech company is aiming to begin connecting outdoor enthusiasts and rural landowners through its prototype app in time for the 2020 hunting season, as the government prepares to implement its more stringent trespassing rules.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon-based Western Heritage won a $10,000 grant from Innovation Saskatchewan to find a technological solution for a problem created, in part, by new legislation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/new-trespassing-law-will-mean-you-have-to-seek-permission-before-accessing-land">Changes to the Trespass to Property Act will remove presumed consent for access to rural land</a>. Currently, permission is assumed unless land is posted with signs. But once the amendments come into effect, the public will have to seek permission from rural property owners before entering.</p>
      <p>Western Heritage’s answer is an application known as SaskLander. Project manager Aldo Scribante and design lead Sauvelm McClean have spent the past four months developing it. They are already pilot testing in the RM of Shellbrook, and plan to have a version ready for the public to use there in time for hunting season next year.</p>
      <p>The app will then be expanded across the province once they sign up enough landowners. There is no specific timeframe for when that will happen.</p>
      <p>“If people are looking to access rural property, you need to have rural properties for people to access,” said Scribante.</p>
      <p>He said the long-term goal is getting 75-per-cent rural land coverage.</p>
      <p>Tina Beaudry-Mellor, minister responsible for innovation, described the prototype app as “a bit like Airbnb” during a demonstration of the prototype at the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) office in Regina on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“The problem that they’re trying to solve is a difficult problem,” she said. “And the problem is how do we ensure that landowners know who’s on their land and for what reason, and that recreational users still have the opportunity to use that land.”</p>
      <p>Scribante and McClean unveiled an early version that uses GPS, geofencing and a map featuring land parcel verified through the provincial land title system run by Information Services Corporation.</p>
      <p>The interface allows landowners to signal whether their land is open to the public, off limits, or available only upon permission through a colour-coded map visible over desktop or mobile.</p>
      <p>Users, such as hunters or birdwatchers, can select a parcel on the map and report what they want to do on the land. The landowner will then get an alert in real-time and can choose to grant or deny access.</p>
      <p>Scribante said the team is trying to hit the fall 2020 deadline to “at least be in beta so that people can test it and give us some feedback on what needs improvement and what works.”</p>
      <p>McClean said the finished product could include a much broader range of features, including incident reporting, a chat function and the ability to rate users — just like on Airbnb. There will be premium features available for a fee, still to be determined.</p>
      <p>The government’s new trespassing legislation attracted controversy when the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/fsin-vice-chief-vows-to-go-to-war-to-reverse-trespassing-changes">warned that the more stringent rules could affect First Nations treaty rights and vowed to fight them in court</a>.</p>
      <p>McClean said developers reached out to Indigenous stakeholders and talked to FSIN. But he admitted it’s a “complicated question.”</p>
      <p>“We are waiting for more feedback and we’re looking to engage fully with them,” he said. “We haven’t had a full discussion yet with FSIN.”</p>
      <p>He said they want to ensure that the interests of First Nations are respected.</p>
      <p>Representatives of the FSIN were not at the prototype demonstration.</p>
      <p>Beaudry-Mellor said the government has an obligation to ensure the FSIN is engaged in that process. She also said the government will use its social media channels to promote the app and promote adoption as the early version starts rolling out.</p>
      <p>The government said it’s keeping a close eye on progress as it prepares to proclaim the Trespass to Property Act, which is still not in effect. There is currently no timeframe for proclamation.</p>
      <p>“We will be monitoring the progress and development at the app before we make any announcements (about the proclamation of the Act), as we know that communication is an important aspect of this legislation,” said a government spokesperson.</p>
