      <p>A CO Cork transport company last night confirmed it owned the lorry in which 15 people were found in the rear of the vehicle in England.</p>
      <p>Sean Delaney International Transport also said it one of their drivers had been arrested after the discovery was made near Chippenham.</p>
      <p>The Irish man aged in his 50s was detained following reports of "suspicious activity" involving the vehicle on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Police said they closed a road after being called by a member of the public shortly before 8.30pm.</p>
      <p>Fifteen people - all believed to be males aged between 16 and 30 - were found in the rear of the vehicle. Initial medical checks were carried out and 14 people were deemed fit and well, while one person was taken to hospital in Swindon as a precaution.</p>
      <p>A Wiltshire Police spokesman said all 15 men have been arrested on suspicion of entering the UK illegally.</p>
      <p>"The driver of the vehicle, a man his 50s from Ireland, was arrested on suspicion of assisting illegal entry into the country," he added.</p>
      <p>Police later said the investigation "has now been passed to the Home Office".</p>
      <p>"This is routine with these types of investigations and we will continue to provide assistance where appropriate," he said.</p>
      <p>There were reports last night that the driver of the lorry, which was travelling from Callais to Dover, heard knocking and thought it was a flat tyre before discovering the people in the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Sean Delaney International Transport told RTÃ‰ it was satisfied that neither it nor the company's driver had done anything wrong.</p>
      <p>Operations manager Michael Delaney said it was his driver who raised the alarm and alerted police. He said both he and the driver are assisting police in the UK with their enquiries.</p>
