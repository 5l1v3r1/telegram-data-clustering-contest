      <h1>Andy Ruiz Jr explains weight loss aim ahead of Anthony Joshua rematch</h1>
      <h2>Ruiz Jr warned Joshua he will be 'a lot slicker, a lot faster' than when he stunned boxing by beating Joshua in June to take his three heavyweight world titles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T01:11:30+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 01:11</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr says he is going to be 'a lot slicker, a lot faster' as he explained his weight loss target ahead of his rematch with Anthony Joshua next month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andy-ruiz-jr">Ruiz Jr</a> stunned boxing by beating Joshua in Madison Square Garden in June to take his three heavyweight world titles.</p>
      <p>And the two are set to go head-to-head again in Saudi Arabia on December 7 after Joshua triggered the rematch clause in his contract immediately following the defeat.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr - who self-deprecatingly describes himself as "a chubby kid" - plans to be eight pounds lighter than the 268 he weighed in at for his victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/anthony-joshua">Joshua</a> .</p>
      <p>And it looks set to be a clash between two slimmed-down fighters after pictures suggested 2012 Olympic champion Joshua <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/anthony-joshua-shows-lean-physique-20834105">would weigh considerably less than the 247.5lb he scaled before the June fight</a> .</p>

      <p>And Ruiz Jr is confident his fitness regime will pay dividends as he targets a repeat of his New York win.</p>
      <p>"Right now, I'm only three pounds less than when I fought Anthony Joshua," Ruiz Jr told iFLTV.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people are saying 'he looks too skinny, he won't be strong enough for the fight', but those are people who don't really know about boxing.</p>
      <p>"We've been looking really good inside the ring.</p>

      <p>"I just want to be 6lbs, 8lbs lighter than I was on June 1.</p>
      <p>"That's the goal, to be 8lbs lighter, and that's going to make me feel a lot better.</p>
      <p>"It's going to make me a lot slicker, a lot faster, and that's going to tell on December 7.</p>
