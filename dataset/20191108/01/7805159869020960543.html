      <p>While Fossil is primarily known for making traditional watches, the company has been releasing some really compelling smartwatches over the last couple of years. Even though some of Fossil’s smartwatches prioritize <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/fossil-kate-spade-scallop-smartwatch-2-michael-kors-access-sofie/">fashion over tech</a>, their <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/fossil-sport-snapdragon-wear-3100/">Sport smartwatch</a> from last year was one of the first to feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 3100 chip. Over the last couple of years, the popularity of Fossil’s smartwatches has grown to the extent that even Google was prompted to buy <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-buying-40-million-fossil-smartwatch/">$40 million worth of smartwatch tech</a> from the company earlier this year. Most recently, the company released its <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/fossil-gen-5-wear-3100-battery-modes/">Gen 5 smartwatches</a> featuring Snapdragon Wear 3100, 1GB of RAM, speakers and a lot more. And now, it has released a new lineup of hybrid smartwatches that include an analog dial and an always-on display.</p>

      <p>The new Fossil Hybrid HR lineup seamlessly combines physical watch hands with a low-powered always on-display, offering the perfect blend of fashion and tech. The Hybrid HR features a monochromatic circular display in the center, which is capable of displaying crucial information like activity tracking data, weather information, and app notifications. It even offers heart rate tracking capabilities and the company claims that the watch can last over two weeks on a single charge. On top of that, the watch features fast-charging capabilities and can charge up to 80% in just an hour. The smartwatch has a 42mm dial, Bluetooth 4.2 low energy for connectivity, and 16MB of onboard storage. It’s water-resistant up to 3ATM and comes with a 2-year limited warranty.</p>
