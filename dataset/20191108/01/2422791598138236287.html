      <p>CALGARY - A culinary crisis has been avoided at the Calgary Zoo which was facing a bamboo shortage for its four giant pandas.</p>
      <p>The pandas, which staff admit are picky eaters, munch on about 1,200 kilograms of bamboo a week.</p>
      <p>The zoo was left scrambling when Chinese airline Hainan announced it was discontinuing direct flights from China to Calgary at the end of October.</p>
      <p>WestJet stepped forward and is now flying fresh bamboo on its cargo planes twice weekly from Toronto to Calgary.</p>
      <p>The zoo says Hainan still flies to Toronto and hands off the panda food to WestJet.</p>
      <p>The first shipment arrived on Oct. 26.</p>
