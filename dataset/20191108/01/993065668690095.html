      <p>HUNDREDS of people have gathered for the funeral of veteran republican Richard 'Dickie' Glenholmes, who died on Monday after a long illness.</p>
      <p>Mr Glenholmes, who was imprisoned twice for IRA activity including a lengthy jail sentence in England, was in his 80s.</p>
      <p>From the Ballymacarrett district of east Belfast, he was jailed in the 1980s for attempting to free IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton Prison.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, and a number of other senior republicans, including councillor Séanna Walsh, attended Requiem Mass at St Agnes Church in Andersonstown yesterday morning.</p>

      <p>Mr Adams described Mr Glenholmes as "a truly remarkable and exceptional human being".</p>
      <p>"In the hard years when the British imprisoned him without trial and he was locked away for years in England he kept the faith. So did Lily," he said.</p>
      <p>"A republican in her own right, Lily was the perfect partner to Dickie and a wonderful grounded and strong Irish woman.</p>

      <p>"Dickie believed in freedom and in equality. And when the opportunity was created to achieve republican objectives through peaceful and democratic means he embraced it."</p>

      <p>He is survived by his wife Lily, children Eibhlin, Richard, Damien and Michelle.</p>
