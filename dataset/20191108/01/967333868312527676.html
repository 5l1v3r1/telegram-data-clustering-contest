      <blockquote>"We <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201709201057554412-us-silence-sputnik-rt-backlash/">have probably never seen</a> such totalitarianism at work, nowhere, even in Arab countries", Margarita Simonyan said at Rossiya-1’s "60 Minutes" show.</blockquote>
      <p>She claimed that job seekers coming to Sputnik’s Estonian office were routinely brought in for questioning by the Estonian counterintelligence.</p>
      <p>"Estonia uses all means of leverage, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201909291076918843-sputniks-banned-application-moscow-says-will-take-reciprocal-measures-with-british-media/">ranging from the closure</a> of bank accounts to intimidation by security agencies, to stop us and our Sputnik from working there", Simonyan explained.</p>
      <blockquote>"We have never come under such pressure in any country other than Estonia. So here is a taste of your Europe and your famous European democracy," she added.</blockquote>
      <p>Russian media in Estonia and its two Baltic neighbors <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201901181071582627-usa-russia-facebook-pages-removal/">have been frequently targeted</a> by authorities. The Russian Foreign Ministry has accused the EU member state trio of a coordinated crackdown and disregard for freedom of expression.</p>
