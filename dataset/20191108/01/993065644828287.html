      <p>SOLICITORS acting for relatives of a Catholic couple killed by the UVF have called for a “wholly independent” police investigation.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for Co Tyrone woman Bernie McKearney wrote to the PSNI chief constable Simon Byrne last week.</p>
      <p>Her parents Charles Fox (63) and his wife Theresa (53) were gunned down in their home near Moy in Co Tyrone by a UVF gang in September 1992.</p>
      <p>Her husband Kevin was also shot dead by the UVF along with his uncle Jack McKearney in the Moy in Co Tyrone eight months earlier.</p>
      <p>Collusion is suspected in both cases and others carried out in the Mid Ulster area in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
      <p>The call for an independent investigation comes after fresh claims about the killings were made during a recently broadcast BBC Spotlight investigation.</p>
      <p>The programme included claims made by former loyalist Laurence Maguire and featured suspected UVF killer Alan Oliver.</p>
      <p>Oliver has previously been linked to the murders of three Catholics in Craigavon in March 1991.</p>
      <p>Solicitors have now called for the arrest of Maguire and the release of information about Oliver and former UVF commanders Robin Jackson and Billy Wright.</p>
      <p>Ms McKearney last night said: “It’s obvious Mid Ulster families would need a proper investigation.”</p>
      <p>Solicitor Gavin Booth last night said: “The investigation needs to take full account of the RUC, Ministry of Defence and loyalist paramilitaries operating in the Mid Ulster area.</p>
      <p>“Any failure to consider these activities in the round risks compromising the effectiveness of the investigation.”</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable George Clarke said the contents of the letter are “under consideration and will be responded to as soon as possible."</p>
