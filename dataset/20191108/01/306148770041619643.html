      <h1>DNS-over-HTTPS Will Eventually Roll Out in All Major Browsers, Despite ISP Opposition</h1>

      <p>All major browsers -- including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi, Brave -- <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-will-eventually-roll-out-in-all-major-browsers-despite-isp-opposition/">have plans to support DNS-over-HTTPS (or DoH)</a>, a protocol that encrypts DNS traffic and helps improve a user's privacy on the web. From a report:<i> The DoH protocol has been one of the year's hot topics. It's a protocol that, when deployed inside a browser, it allows the browser to hide DNS requests and responses inside regular-looking HTTPS traffic. Doing this makes a user's DNS traffic invisible to third-party network observers, such as ISPs. But while users love DoH and have deemed it a privacy boon, ISPs, networking operators, and cyber-security vendors hate it. A UK ISP called Mozilla <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/07/05/1438257/internet-group-brands-mozilla-internet-villain-for-supporting-dns-privacy-feature">an "internet villain" for its plans to roll out DoH</a>, and a Comcast-backed lobby group has been caught preparing a misleading document about DoH that they were planning to present to US lawmakers in the hopes of preventing DoH's broader rollout. However, this may be a little too late. ZDNet has spent the week reaching out to major web browser providers to gauge their future plans regarding DoH, and all vendors plan to ship it, in one form or another.</i></p>
