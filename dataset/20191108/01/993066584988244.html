      <p>CONCERNED parents and a GAA club say they fear someone could be killed as a result of roadworks linked to the A6 upgrade in Co Derry.</p>
      <p>The work is being carried out as part of a multi-million pound scheme designed to reduce travel times between Derry and Belfast.</p>
      <p>Safety concerns have been raised about the same stretch of road near Castledawson.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive last night said it has received “a number complaints in relation to the A6 upgrade”.</p>
      <p>Thousands of vehicles use the route every day and in recent month a series of roadworks and closures have caused traffic disruption.</p>
      <p>Some parents and St Malachy’s GAA club, which is based close to construction work in Castledawson, have voiced concerns about people and traffic attempting to navigate a busy junction on the route.</p>
      <p>The club sits close the main Derry to Belfast road and is accessed from a small country road known as the Brough Road.</p>
      <p>Residents, politicians and road officials were meeting yesterday to discuss the matter.</p>
      <p>Mother-of-three Cathryn McOscar said she was worried that lives could be lost.</p>
      <p>She said that a specially built footbridge, which links the club to the local community, is not lit up at night and that temporary lighting placed at a junction of the A6 works and Brough Road has since been removed.</p>
      <p>“Somebody is going to get killed and there’s no doubt in my mind that is going to happen,” she said.</p>
      <p>"If something tragic happens it affects he whole community, not just one family”.</p>
      <p>Mrs McOscar also claimed that some bus drivers have opted not to drop school children off at the Brough Road junction due to concerns for their safety.</p>
      <p>She said that transport chiefs plan to relocate a bus stop almost a mile away but that no lighting or footpath will be provided for children who will have to make the journey on foot.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook post St Malachy’s GAC said: “No lighting, buses, sports facilities and children - assurances and action need to be taken now, before any incident of a terrible nature should occur.</p>
      <p>“Above all, health and safety comes first.</p>
      <p>“And, where our precious children are concerned - it is a must.”</p>
      <p>SDLP MLA Patsy McGlone attended last night’s meeting.</p>
      <p>“There has been an ongoing series of issues,” he said.</p>
      <p>“A lot of it is down to traffic management and safety as well.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive said: “HSENI has received a number complaints in relation to the A6 upgrade at Castledawson.</p>
      <p>“All complaints will, or have been, addressed in line with our complaints policy.”</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Translink said: “We are in discussions with relevant stakeholders regarding the on-going works programme on the A6 to ensure the safety of our passengers and staff.”</p>
