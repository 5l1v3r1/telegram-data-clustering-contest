      <p>United States blockchain-based rewards and marketing company Refereum has announced its latest partnership with decentralized streaming platform DLive to reward gamers for creating and watching content.</p>
      <p>According to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Nov. 7, Refereum’s partnership with one of blockchain’s largest streaming platforms, DLive, will enable users to earn rewards for live-streaming games.</p>
      <p>DLive is reportedly the first blockchain-powered streaming service to join the Refereum platform, alongside Twitch and Mixer. DLive CEO Charles Wayn said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Bringing benefits to our streamers is always one of DLive team’s priorities. We are so happy to partner with Refereum to achieve shared goals and ultimately benefit the whole content creators community.”</blockquote>
      <p>Refereum’s DLive integration has reportedly gone live, enabling gamers to start earning rewards by engaging with a variety of live streams.</p>
      <h3>Refereum brings crypto payouts to PUBG</h3>
      <p>In July, Refereum <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-gaming-platform-refereum-brings-crypto-payouts-to-pubg">announced</a> a partnership with a South Korea-based online games developer and publisher to expand its in-game rewards scheme. Refereum said at the time that it would roll out a crypto payout feature to players of Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds, a game that has seen over 8 million sales.</p>
      <h3>DLive employs the biggest name in gaming</h3>
      <p>In April, PewDiePie, the personality behind the most-subscribed gaming channel on YouTube, began streaming exclusively on DLive. Just over a month after this <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-subscribed-youtuber-pewdiepie-partners-with-blockchain-livestreaming-platform">partnership</a> started, DLive saw a 67% increase in monthly active users, claiming that its audience had accounted for more than 5 million viewers and over 70,000 streamers at the time.</p>
