      <p>THE funeral of a west Belfast man who was the first chairman of the Royal Ulster Constabulary George Cross Foundation, will take place tomorrow.</p>
      <p>James McDonald, who was 81, died on Tuesday at his Belfast home.</p>
      <p>Born and raised on the Falls Road, Mr McDonald was a Catholic Unionist who had been bestowed a number of accolades during his lifetime.</p>
      <p>The father-of-two was largely recognised for his work in the voluntary service with both the Prince's Trust and the Prince's Youth Business Trust.</p>
      <p>In 1990, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre for his charity work in the Holy Land. He was later promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the same Order.</p>
      <p>He was also a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order, which is awarded for distinguished personal service to the Sovereign, and a Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory the Great, awarded by Pope John Paul II for charity work in Ireland.</p>
      <p>A qualified accountant, had also worked for the Labour Relations Agency and at one time was an independent assessor of military complaints.</p>
      <p>Shortly after he stepped down as Chairman of the Royal Ulster Constabulary George Cross Foundation in October 2013 - a role he had held for 11 years - Mr McDonald suffered a heart attack.</p>
      <p>After spending seven weeks in hospital following a quadruple bypass, he made a full recovery.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonald lost two of his brothers during the Troubles,</p>
      <p>Sean and Ronald, who owned a Belfast garage, were murdered along with their 16-year-old apprentice, Tony McGrady, by the UVF in 1973.</p>
      <p>Requiem Mass for Mr McDonald will take place tomorrow at 12 noon at St Brigid's Church, Derryvolgie Avenue followed by a service at Roselawn Crematorium at 2pm.</p>
