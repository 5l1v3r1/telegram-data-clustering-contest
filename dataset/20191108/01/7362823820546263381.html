      <h1>Jeff Goldblum says Woody Allen deserves due process, would consider working with him again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T01:44:49+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 01:44</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p>Actor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/skimpy-short-shorts-for-men-new-trend-jeff-goldblum-is-loving-it">Jeff Goldblum</a> defended <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/woody-allen-metoo-movement-allegations-molestation">Woody Allen</a> despite a string of disturbing allegations against the director amid the #MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>In an interview with iNews published Wednesday, Goldblum was asked about whether he would collaborate with Allen again after appearing in the filmmaker's iconic comedy "Annie Hall."</p>
      <p>"I think there is a presumption of innocence until proven guilty," Goldblum responded. "I know I enjoyed working with him many years ago and I sat in with his band once too."</p>
      <p>As the #MeToo movement ensnared powerful figures in entertainment, media, and politics who've been accused of sexual misconduct, Allen's years-old allegation of molestation from his daughter Dylan Farrow has prevented his new film "A Rainy Day in New York" from finding distribution in the U.S.</p>

      <p>While the "Jurassic Park" actor expressed his support for the #MeToo movement, he also expressed his admiration for Allen's work and didn't close the door on working with him again.</p>

      <p>"Even though I feel like this cultural shift is very, very positive and long overdue and I support it wholeheartedly and take it very seriously, I also admire his body of work," Goldblum <a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/jeff-goldblum-interview-jurassic-world-me-too-woody-allen-858437">continued</a>. "So I would consider working with him again, until I learned something more.”</p>
      <p>Goldblum is set to star in a new series on Disney's streaming service Disney+ and is expected to return to the "Jurassic Park" franchise for its next installment, slated for 2021.</p>
