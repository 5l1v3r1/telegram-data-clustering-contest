      <h2>Port Moody-Coquitlam New Democrat Bonita Zarrillo trailed winner Conservative Nelly Shin by 333 votes</h2>

      <p>Elections Canada says a judicial recount of the Oct. 21 federal election results has ended in a B.C. riding after the New Democrat challenger called it off.</p>
      <p>Chief Electoral Officer of Canada Stephane Perrault says a request for withdrawal was received from the candidate who initially asked for the recount.</p>
      <p>Port Moody-Coquitlam New Democrat Bonita Zarrillo originally trailed winner Conservative Nelly Shin by 333 votes but sought the recount after the election night tally was officially certified.</p>
      <p>It showed Zarrillo had gained 180 votes, putting her just 153 votes behind Shin, while more than 500 ballots had been declared spoiled.</p>
      <p>A B.C. Supreme Court justice began the recount Wednesday but Elections Canada says the process was terminated Thursday at Zarrillo’s request.</p>
