      <p>SINGAPORE, Nov 8 — Even after girls did not respond to Angelo Anwyll Goh Hao-Yi’s requests for sex on several of his fake Facebook accounts, where he posed as other men, he did not give up.The sales engineer created a female Facebook profile under the name Vacinta Koh and asked underage girls if they wanted to be a “part-time girlfriend” or escort for some quick cash. </p>
      <p>Posing as Vacinta, he also told them what they could earn for different sex acts.</p>
      <p>Goh then pretended to be Vacinta’s client, picked the victims up in his black BMW and drove them to his landed home, a hotel or a multi-storey car park. </p>
      <p>Over about two years, he had sex with eight girls aged between 13 and 17 — all of whom did not know he was actually Vacinta.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the 34-year-old father of three was sentenced in a district court to four years and 10 months’ jail for his actions. </p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to 11 charges of sexual penetration of a minor, commercial sex with a minor and making obscene films, with another 15 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing.</p>
      <p>Goh will begin serving his sentence in a week and remains out on bail as he wants to spend time with his children.  </p>
      <p>The court heard that Goh created the Vacinta Koh account around May 2016 and pretended to be under 20 years old.</p>
      <p>He used photographs that he saved from an acquaintance’s public Facebook profile to make the account seem genuine. He also linked it to a fake Instagram account and linked his fake email address to a WeChat account.</p>
      <p>After finding young girls whose appearances he liked, he sent them Facebook friend requests. </p>
      <p>He messaged those who accepted the requests, asking if they were interested in earning S$100 to S$200 an hour. </p>
      <p>He told them what the job entailed and that he could recommend some “nice clients” to them. </p>
      <p>If they were reluctant, he used several methods to persuade them. </p>
      <p>Still pretending to be Vacinta, he said that “she” was also working as an escort and could arrange for the girl to meet one of “her” regular clients first.</p>
      <p>One of the girls, aged 14, told him that she had been raped before and shared other personal information. </p>
      <p>Goh expressed sympathy and replied that “she herself” had been raped.</p>
      <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Pei Wei told the court: “‘Vacinta’ would also inform the girls that there was a stringent vetting process for clients, as they only allowed young, non-ugly and rich men who underwent regular health checks and that anyone who was rude or abusive would be banned from being clients.”</p>
      <p>If the girl agreed, Goh would get them to meet “a client”, who was actually himself. When they asked for personal information of the “client”, like a phone number or picture, he refused to give it and explained that he wanted to protect everyone’s privacy.</p>
      <p>The rates for different sex acts ranged from S$30 to S$100. The girls would be paid S$10 more if they wore a school uniform and S$20 more if they agreed to be filmed during sex.</p>
      <p>He also advised them to bring their school uniforms instead of wearing them to meet him.</p>
      <p>To further his scheme, he asked the girls to introduce their friends if they wanted money and warned them not to let anyone else know about their “jobs”.</p>
      <p>He was arrested on April 2 last year and by then, he had 2,188 Facebook friends on his Vacinta account.</p>
      <p>The authorities seized several mobile phones and a laptop from him and found that he had 23 obscene films as well.</p>
      <p>The prosecution sought 60 months’ jail for Goh while his lawyer Daniel Atticus Xu asked for 48 months’ jail instead.</p>
      <p>For sexual penetration of a minor under 14 years old, he could have been jailed for up to 20 years, and fined or caned.</p>
      <p>For commercial sex with a minor under 18, he could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined or both. — TODAY</p>
