      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The Los Angeles Rams bye week is officially in the rear-view mirror.<br/><br/>All-Pro Aaron Donald will be making his second flight to Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>He spent his bye week back home.<br/><br/>"It's my home," he said. "That's where I'm at during the off-season. That's where my family is at - that's where I was born and raised. That's where I was molded at."<br/><br/>The bye week is great for rest and recovery.<br/><br/>But the other big win for the Rams is getting All-Pro linebacker Clay Matthews back from a broken jaw.<br/><br/>"I wouldn't just drink protein shakes. I would mix my food up with some kind of broth," Matthews said, adding he's proud he only lost 5 pounds.<br/><br/>The Rams will fly to Pittsburgh on Saturday. Wide receiver Brandin Cooks is already there. He won't play Sunday as he's seeing a specialist for the concussion he suffered against Cincinnati in the game in London.<br/><br/>"I think he did feel better, having gone to Pittsburgh earlier for tests," head coach Sean McVay said.<br/><br/>The Rams, like Cooks, hope to get out of Pittsburgh Sunday healthy.<br/><br/>Pittsburgh will present a challenge for the Rams. The Steelers started their season shaky - on a three-game losing streak and with a season-ending elbow injury to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. But then they found their footing with backup QB Mason Rudolph and are now 4-4.<br/><br/>The Rams are 5-3, coming off wins over the Cincinnati Bengals and Atlanta Falcons before their bye.</p>
