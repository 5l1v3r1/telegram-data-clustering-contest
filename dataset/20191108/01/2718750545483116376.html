      <h1>Batter Up! Hear That Call! D’Arcy Carden, Abbi Jacobson to Play Ball in <i>A</i> <i>League of Their Own</i> Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T01:59:57+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 01:59</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Crucchiola</a></address>
      <p>News of a <i>League of Their Own </i>series at Amazon <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/amazon-is-developing-a-league-of-their-own-tv-adaptation.html">first started</a> making the rounds last year, as Abbi Jacobson <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/abbi-jacobson-and-will-graham-developing-a-league-of-their-own-comedy-series-at-amazon.html">began developing</a> a half-hour comedy based on the classic <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/penny-marshall-death-legacy-laverne.html">Penny Marshall</a> film with <i>Mozart in the Jungle </i>writer and producer Will Graham. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/darcy-carden-star-a-league-own-series-at-amazon-1253276?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_source=Direct"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>, we’ve got new news today! The <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/broad-city-gross-humor-women.html"><i>Broad City</i></a><i> </i>co-creator will star in the <i>League </i>pilot opposite <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/the-good-place-season-3-darcy-carden-janet.html">D’Arcy Carden</a>, who also appeared on the hit Comedy Central show. The series would begin with formation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in 1943 and focus once again on the beloved Rockford Peaches, and it would go “deeper into the issues facing the country” than the original film did while still “following a ragtag team of women figuring themselves out while fighting to realize their dreams of playing professional baseball,” which is very much like the movie. In a nice turn, Jacobson and Graham also reportedly got the <i>League </i>blessings of Geena Davis and Marshall before her death.</p>
