      <p>With the rise of the wireless earphones it would maybe seem the classical wired ones are going out of favor, but many users still actually prefer the old school. After all with them you are never going out of battery power or experience hiccups with connection. And the Huawei CM33 is just that, classical earphones, but with the sprinkle of the modern style too, because they have the USB Type-C connector instead of the 3.5 mm jack. And can offer Hi-Res audio, half in-ear design, 3-button remote control and integrated microphone. Ideally paired with some of the Huawei devices with Histen 3D audio technology, but won’t disappoint with any other phone either. And can be yours either in white or black<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=223739079860"> for just $12.99 on Ebay</a>.</p>
