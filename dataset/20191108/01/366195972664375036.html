      <p>We may be receiving much more <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-baby/profile/">Lil Baby</a> in the days to come because the rapper shared that he's ready for his season. On Wednesday, the rapper took to his T<a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-baby-finally-announces-return-with-woah-release-date-news.94980.html">witter to share that 2020 was his year and "I really been bullsh*ttin whole 2019.</a>" To say that he hasn't been grinding all year seems a tad far-fetched, especially because he's released a number of singles and collaborations.</p>
      <p>The Atlanta rapper appeared multiple times on <i>Quality Control Music's Control The Streets Volume 2</i> compilation, collaborated with Lykke Li on a remix to her track "sex money feelings die," and linked with <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tags/gunna/">Gunna</a> on <i>Drip Harder. </i>Early Friday, Lil Baby returned with "Woah," the first in what many believe is the rapper's takeover, so give it a spin and let us know if this is the heat you've been waiting for.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions<br/>I'm on that back when I step on the floor sh*t<br/>I'm on that me and the bro kick a door sh*t<br/>I'm on that back when I still out the stove sh*t<br/>Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old sh*t<br/>I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope sh*t</p>
