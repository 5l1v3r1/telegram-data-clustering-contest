      <p>BAGHDAD (AP) — Masked men attacked anti-government protesters in Iraq’s southern city of Basra overnight, killing five and wounding scores, Iraqi state TV and medical officials said Friday.</p>
      <p>The shooting in Basra occurred around midnight Thursday and wounded around 120 people, according to medical officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets since last month in the capital and across the largely Shiite south to demand sweeping political change.</p>
      <p>In Baghdad on Friday, Iraqi state television said that explosive experts detonated a bomb under a bridge that has been a daily flashpoint between security forces and protesters trying to force their way into the heavily fortified Green Zone, which hosts the government’s headquarters.</p>
      <p>The report gave no further details about the controlled detonation under Sinak bridge over the Tigris River that cuts through the capital city.</p>
      <p>Also Friday, protester Amir Shami said security forces tore down tents at an protest sit-in in the holy city of Karbala.</p>
      <p>More than 250 people have been killed since the unrest erupted Oct. 1.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators complain of widespread corruption, lack of job opportunities and poor basic services, including regular power cuts despite Iraq’s vast oil reserves.</p>
