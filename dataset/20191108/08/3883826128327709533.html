        <b>Great Britain's 200m world champion Dina Asher-Smith says she will support the Athletics Association, an athletes' union formed in response to changes to the Diamond League programme.</b>
      </p>
      <p>American two-time Olympic triple jump champion Christian Taylor launched the body to "fight for athletes' rights".</p>
      <p>"You know you always have my support! Let's do this," <a href="https://twitter.com/dinaashersmith/status/1192537203945222145">tweeted Asher-Smith.</a></p>
      <p>The 200m and triple jump were two of four events cut from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/50324540">the regular 2020 Diamond League programme.</a></p>
      <p>The 3,000m steeplechase and 200m will still feature at 10 of 15 Diamond meetings, while two will stage the discus and triple jump events.</p>
      <p>None of the four will be included in the Diamond League final in Zurich in September.</p>

      <p>Diamond League chairman and International Association of Athletics Federations president Lord Coe said the changes were intended "to create a faster-paced, more exciting global league that will be the showcase for our sport".</p>
      <p>However Taylor said "separating the events can only damage this sport we all love".</p>
      <p>"We will fight for athletes' rights and ultimately demand a seat at the table and a say in how our sport is run and how the sport can grow and evolve without ripping out its core."</p>
      <p>He invited fellow athletes to email to register their interest and follow the organisation's social media accounts.</p>

      <p>Britain's Adam Gemili, who expressed surprise at the Diamond League's announcement on Wednesday, retweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/Taylored2jump/status/1192532973880524802">Taylor's manifesto.</a></p>
      <p>Athletes already have two voting positions on the 26-person IAAF Council with competitors at the recent World Championships in Doha balloted on who should represent them as part of the Athletes' Commission.</p>
      <p>French pole vaulter Renaud Lavillenie and New Zealand shot putter Valerie Adams are among those elected.</p>
      <p>"We are fully supportive," an IAAF spokesperson told BBC Sport of the Athletics Association's creation.</p>
      <p>"The more athletes involved in the decisions made in the sport the better the sport will be."</p>
