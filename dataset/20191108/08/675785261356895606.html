      <h2>In a new interview, Jim Ryan, CEO at Sony, has finally revealed new details about the PlayStation 5 ahead of its release in Holiday 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:48:37+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>With over a year to go before the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> is finally unveiled, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sony">Sony </a>has remained fairly tight-lipped about the highly-anticipated console.</p>
      <p>Sony has already confirmed the console’s name - PlayStation 5 - and a vague launch date of ‘Holiday 2020’, but hasn’t told us much more about the device.</p>
      <p>Now, Jim Ryan, CEO at Sony, has finally revealed new details, during a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-07-sonys-jim-ryan-we-had-to-make-changes-to-deliver-our-ps5-dream">GamesIndustry.biz.</a></p>
      <p>He said: “As we move towards the next-generation in 2020, one of our [Sony's] tasks - probably our main task - is to take that community and transition it from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5, and at a scale and pace that we've never delivered on before.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ryan said that Sony is working on several first-party games that could ‘make or break’ the success of the PlayStation.</p>

      <p>However, he added that Sony is already ‘hearing from developers and publishers [about] the ease in which they are able to get code running on PlayStation 5’, which is reportedly ‘way beyond any experience they've had on any other PlayStation platform.’</p>
      <p>The added details come shortly after Sony finally confirmed the name and launch date for its next generation console.</p>
      <p>As expected, the console is called the PlayStation 5 , and will launch in time for ‘Holiday 2020.’</p>

      <p>In a blog about the news, Jim Ryan , President and CEO of SIE, said: “Since we originally unveiled our next-generation console in April, we know that there’s been a lot of excitement and interest in hearing more about what the future of games will bring.</p>
      <p>“Today I’m proud to share that our next-generation console will be called PlayStation 5, and we’ll be launching in time for Holiday 2020.”</p>
