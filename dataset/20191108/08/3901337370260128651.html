      <p>Ibrahimovic's two-season stay in the US will seemingly come to an end in January after the 38-year-old confirmed he would not be renewing his contract with Galaxy.</p>
      <p>The former FC Barcelona and Manchester United star has been strongly linked with a return to Europe and hinted last month that he could be headed to Spain, although that was later revealed to be part of a campaign to promote a Spanish betting company.</p>

      <p>MLS Commissioner Don Garber has now seemingly dropped a big clue about the Swedish forward's future after appearing to name-drop the player's next club during a recent interview.</p>
      <p>"Zlatan is such an interesting guy," Garber told <i>ESPN.</i></p>
      <p>"He keeps my hands full and my inbox full, but he's a thrill a minute.</p>
      <p>"He is a 38-year-old guy who is being recruited by AC Milan, one of the top clubs in the world."</p>
