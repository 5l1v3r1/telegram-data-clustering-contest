      <p>An unemployed man has been formally charged with attempted murder for allegedly knifing <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/breaking-pro-beijing-firebrand-junius-ho-stabbed-while-canvassing-in-tuen-mun/">fiery pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho on Wednesday morning</a>.</p>
      <p>Tung Pak-fai, 30, is accused of attacking Ho while he was campaigning in Tuen Mun. He was initially arrested on suspicion of wounding, but he appeared at Fanling Magistrates’ Court this morning <a href="https://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/news/20191108/bkn-20191108000358760-1108_00822_001.html">charged with one count of attempted murder</a>, on.cc reports.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors told the court that they were still waiting for Ho’s medical report, and asked the court for more time to conduct DNA and fingerprint analysis, and to examine Tung’s cell phone, tablet, and two computers.</p>
      <p>Acting Principal Magistrate Don So Man-lung adjourned the case until Feb. 3. Tung didn’t apply for bail.</p>
      <p>RTHK, meanwhile, reports that Ho left the hospital this afternoon. As he left the ward, he gave reporters the “OK” hand gesture, and <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1490777-20191108.htm">said he would continue campaigning</a>.</p>
      <p>Ho is running in the upcoming district council elections in Tuen Mun.</p>
