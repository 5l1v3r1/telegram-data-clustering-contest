      <h1>5 signs of boredom you should not ignore in a long-term relationship</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Time, as we know, is the biggest healer but it can also be an enemy that causes irreparable damage in one’s life. Having said that, with time even the most beautiful and romantic relationship can go through a phase of stagnancy. Once the early stages of a relationship are over, most couples suffer from a sense of boredom as the excitement of being in love dwindles. Some couples realise the damage boredom can cause in their relationship and take adequate measures to safeguard themselves and their bond. But some unfortunate ones let their relationship succumb under the pressure of monotony. Hence, it’s important for couples to recognise the signs of boredom in a long-term relationship and ensure that they don’t end up paying a hefty price for it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You have stopped fighting and no longer care about each other</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s a misconception that couples in a healthy relationship do not fight. According to experts, fights provide an outlet to sort out differences and help couples to vent out their frustrations. Not fighting with a partner is a sign of lack of interest, which means they no longer care to correct each other’s mistakes or sort out their differences. Boredom can often make partners grow indifferent to each other. If you aren’t engaging in healthy fights with your partner like you used to before, you aren’t in a happy territory.</p>

        <b>You have dinner in silence</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks to our busy schedules, we are hardly left with much time to spend with our loved ones. After a hectic day in the workplace, most couples look forward to having dinner together during which they talk about their day or catch up with each other. In case, you are having dinner in silence with your partner, don’t mistake this as a good table manner. This might also mean you are simply bored and are no longer interested in making your dinner an engaging affair like you used to when you had just started dating.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stalking an ex-lover on social media</b>
      </p>
      <p>This, perhaps, is the most common sign of boredom in a relationship. Wanting to know what an ex-lover is doing or being curious about him or her is a sign that the current relationship lacks excitement. Stalking an ex-lover on social media might start as an innocent activity but it can lead to irreparable damage in the present relationship.</p>

        <b>You are happy to stay extra late at work</b>
      </p>
      <p>Remember the initial days of a relationship, when you could hardly wait to wrap up your work in the office and leave in a hurry to meet your lover? But things change when the initial excitement is over and boredom slowly creeps into the relationship. Unlike the initial days of your budding romance, you no longer wait eagerly for the day to end so that you could meet your partner. Rather, you are happy spending extra hours in the office doing work, which you could easily do later on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You are jealous of your friends who are in love</b>
      </p>
      <p>You are treading on dangerous territory if other’s happiness or romance makes you jealous easily. This is a sign that you aren’t content and your current relationship is going through a phase that indicates a dark future. In case, you notice such signs, it’s high time for you to take adequate actions to rekindle the lost passion in your relationship.</p>
