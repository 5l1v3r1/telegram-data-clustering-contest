        <b>World stocks rallied to near record highs on Friday after China said it had agreed with the United States to cancel tariffs in phases, a key demand of Beijing for sealing a deal to end a trade war that has slowed economic growth and roiled markets.</b>
      </p>
      <p>MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe rose slightly to stand at 543.70, just a hair off the record high of 550.63 reached in January 2018.</p>
      <p>The index compiler’s gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2% in early trade while Tokyo’s Nikkei jumped 0.75% to a 13-month high.</p>
      <p>China and the United States have agreed to roll back tariffs on each others’ goods as part of the first phase of a trade deal, officials from both sides said on Thursday, in further signs of progress even as both side continue to haggle over several contentious issues.</p>
      <p>“As the US-China dispute seems to be heading for a resolution while the developed world is adopting very easy monetary policy, risk assets are enjoying the tail wind,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.</p>
      <p>The Chinese commerce ministry, without laying out a timetable, said the two countries had agreed to cancel the tariffs in phases.</p>
      <p>But multiple sources familiar with the talks said the plan faces fierce internal opposition at the White House and from outside advisers.</p>
      <p>While US stocks pared gains on the report of the opposition to the deal in Washington, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 did close at all-time highs, while the Nasdaq missed a record close by less than two-tenths of a point.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 gained ended 0.27% higher at 3,085.18.</p>
      <p>The pan-European STOXX 600 index has also pierced through its January 2018 peak to come within a striking distance of its record high set in April 2015.</p>
      <p>As investors wind back their buying in safe assets, the 10-year US Treasuries yield rose 11.8 basis points to 1.930%, marking the biggest daily increase since Nov 9, 2016, which followed the surprise election victory by Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>The yield has jumped to as high as 1.973%, a three-month peak, on Thursday and last stood at 1.924%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to minus 0.050%, a 5-1/2-month high, as expectations of a Bank of Japan rate cuts dissipated in the past week or so.</p>
      <p>In the currency market, the yuan stood firm while safe-haven currencies lost their edge.</p>
      <p>The offshore yuan traded at 6.9976 yuan per dollar, having hit a three-month high of 6.9530 per dollar in US trade on Thursday. The dollar climbed to 109.31 yen, reaching a five-month high of 109.49 the previous day.</p>
      <p>The euro slipped to $1.1050, having marked a low of $1.10355 in US trade, its weakest since Oct 16.</p>
      <p>That helped to push up the dollar index to three-week highs of 98.236. The index last stood at 98.134.</p>
      <p>Gold also eased to $1,467.9 per ounce, having hit a five-week low of $1.460.7 on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Oil prices gained on the US-China trade deal hopes. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.1% to $57.09 per barrel in Asia but has gained 1.4% so far this week.</p>
