      <h1>Arsene Wenger out of Bayern Munich running after talks break down over deal</h1>
      <h2>Former Arsenal chief Wenger was open to replacing sacked Bayern boss Niko Kovac, having been out of management since leaving the Gunners in 2018</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:16:32+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:16</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsene-wenger">Arsene Wenger</a> is out of the running to be the next Bayern Munich boss.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss Wenger, 70, was open to taking charge at the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>And the former Gunners chief spoke to Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge about the post.</p>
      <p>Bayern were keen on Wenger but only on a temporary basis until the end of the season and the Frenchman wanted a more permanent role.</p>
      <p>That has led to Wenger and Bayern ending discussions about him taking charge of the German giants who sacked Niko Kovac last weekend.</p>

      <p>The Croatian was dismissed after a 5-1 thrashing by Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Although Bayern remain fourth in the Bundesliga, and it was only their second loss of the league season, the defeat meant Kovac's defence had conceded 16 times in just 10 matches.</p>

      <p>Bayern may now leave caretaker Hansi Flick in charge until the end of the season but will make a decision next week in the international break.</p>
      <p>They could turn to Ajax boss Eric ten Hag as a permanent replacement next summer while Wenger still has an offer from FIFA to be their next technical director on the table.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> defender Marcel Desailly claimed this week his thoughts that Wenger is now too old to return to management.</p>
      <p>Speaking on beIN Sports, the World Cup winner said: "No, he should not be in the dugout. It's not for him any more.</p>
      <p>"He has great possibilities to restructure, to build up the philosophy of the club, towards the first team and the academy.</p>
      <p>"But as a frontline, we don't see him anymore. He's 70 years old."</p>
