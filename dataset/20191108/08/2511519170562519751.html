      <p>Hip-hop artist <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/common-interview-rapper-let-love-album-tracklist-features-kanye-west-jay-z-a9072296.html">Common</a> has said he wants to meet with a white teacher who dressed up in blackface to look like him, so he can “educate” him about how to behave in a classroom.</p>
      <p>On Thursday (11 November), a video circulated Twitter showing a man teaching a class on Halloween at the Milpitas Unified School District, with his face covered in black makeup.</p>
      <p>He can be heard rapping to a drumbeat he was playing to the class, seen in a video posted by a student with the caption: “Sooooooooo... one of our WHITE teachers at mhs yesterday decided to paint his face so look like common the rapper yesterday.”</p>
      <p>The school has since suspended him.</p>
      <p>Common, speaking at LAX airport, revealed he is heading to the same area as the teacher and would like to ”break down” why it’s “unacceptable” face to face.</p>
      <p>“It’s important that teachers and people who are educating our children are well educated themselves on things that deal with history, culture,” he told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/07/common-talks-teacher-blackface-california-suspended-rapper/"><i>TMZ</i></a>. “Emotional intelligence is important. We need to look at the teacher, the administration and people we have leading our children in classrooms and make sure they’re fully equipped.”</p>
      <p>He added: “In truth, I want to do something at that school. I’m headed now to that area,”</p>
      <p>When asked if he’d be up for meeting the teacher, Common said: “For sure. I would love to hear what makes [him] think you can go up and do that. I’ll break it down to him. It’ll be done with love, but it would be for real. I would let him know... this ain’t acceptable.”</p>
      <p>The rapper stated it was “awkward” watching the video. </p>
