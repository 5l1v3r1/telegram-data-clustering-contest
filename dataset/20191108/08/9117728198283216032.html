        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> has heaped the praise on what <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> has done over his Formula 1 career, but also played down comparisons between the British driver and the guy whose record he is chasing; Michael Schumacher.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton clinched his sixth world title last weekend, after finishing in second-place at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a>, meaning he is now just one Drivers' Championship away from Schumacher's all-time record of seven.</p>
      <p>However, Vettel, who has won four himself, has played down the comparisons between the Stevenage-born driver and Schumacher, saying it's a difficult job to compare the two drivers.</p>

      <p><i>"I don't really look at it that way, but if you want to look at (it) that way, then obviously this year we failed to stop and hopefully next year, we will succeed," </i>Vettel replied when asked about Hamilton getting close to Schumacher's all-time record, as quoted by <i>RaceFans.net.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"I think it's pretty incredible what <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a>, together with Lewis in the last years, have achieved. You need to respect that and honour that. And I think it's always independent from what other people have done in a different time. It's very hard to compare these things.</i>

        <i>"But certainly, he and they deserve what they have achieved. I think you don't achieve these things by accident."</i>
