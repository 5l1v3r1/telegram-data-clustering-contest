      <p>Jeff Goldblum has controversially defended Woody Allen, suggesting there is a “presumption of innocence until proven guilty” regarding the sexual abuse allegations made against the legendary director.</p>
      <p>“I think there is a presumption of innocence until proven guilty,” Goldblum told <a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/jeff-goldblum-interview-jurassic-world-me-too-woody-allen-858437">The I</a>.</p>
      <p>“I know I enjoyed working with him many years ago and I sat in with his band once too.”</p>
      <p>Allen was previously accused of molesting his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow,  but he has always denied any wrongdoing.</p>

      <p>In light of the allegations, Hollywood figures such as Colin Firth have vowed never to work with Allen again.</p>
      <p>But Goldblum, who had a minor role in Hall’s 1977 film <i>Annie Hall</i>, also says he would definitely work with the director in future.</p>
      <p>When asked by<a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/"> The Radio Times</a>, Goldblum responded: “Well, that’s a very publicly provocative and delicate question. As we know, times have evolved, and even the movie <i>Manhattan</i>.</p>
      <p>“I’d have to say yes. Yep. I’ve looked into some of it, and I’d look into it more, but the answer is yes.”</p>
      <p>It comes after Allen debuted his latest film,<i> A Rainy Day In New York</i>, earlier this year. It is yet to secure a UK release, but stars Timothee Chalamet and Elle Fanning as two young lovers.</p>
      <p>Goldblum, meanwhile, will <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/jeff-goldblum-reveals-jurassic-world-3-will-start-filming-next-summer-2563428">return to the <i>Jurassic World</i> universe</a> next summer to shoot Jurassic World 3 alongside returning stars Sam Neill and Laura Dern.</p>
