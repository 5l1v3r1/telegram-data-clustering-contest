      <p>Mikaela Mullaney Straus, the Brooklyn-born pop insurgent known as King Princess, doesn’t turn 21 until next month, but she’s clearly already spent a bunch of time figuring out how her first late-night performance should go. King Princess released her full-length debut <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062000/king-princess-cheap-queen-review/franchises/the-week-in-pop/">Cheap Queen</a></i> last month, and she’s already collaborated with people like <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2029776/king-princess-i-know-fiona-apple/music/">Fiona Apple </a>and her label boss <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2048113/mark-ronson-pieces-of-us-feat-king-princess/music/">Mark Ronson</a>. She is poised to be a big deal. And last night, she made her TV debut on the <i>Late Show With Stephen Colbert</i>. She made an occasion out of it.</p>
      <p>On <i>Colbert</i> last night, King Princess sang “Hit The Back, which starts out as a raw ballad and turns into a sort of disco-pop stepper. She had a meticulously planned-out stage — cool backdrop, backing band in coordinated outfits. And she really sold both parts of the song, showing off her throatily intense voice and twirling around the stage with panache. She’s a natural.</p>
      <p>As an online bonus, King Princess also sang “1950,” a ballad that was a minor alt-rock radio hit last year. (It comes from her debut EP <i>Make My Bed</i>.) For that one, she picked up a guitar and changed up the mood of the performance. Both performances are impressive, and you can watch them both below.</p>
