      <p>The US on Monday formally notified the UN that it was withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, making the world's largest economy the sole outlier from the agreement.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump went ahead with the pull-out despite mounting evidence of the reality and impact of climate change, with September the fourth month in the row with near- or record-breaking temperatures.</p>

          <b>House passes bill to keep US in Paris climate accord</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>The US presented its withdrawal letter to the UN on the first possible date under the accord negotiated by Trump's predecessor Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>It will be officially out of the Paris accord on November 4, 2020, one day after the US election in which Trump is seeking a second term on appeals to the white working-class.</p>
      <p>Announcing the move, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated Trump's rationale in 2017 that the accord would disadvantage US businesses.</p>
      <p>"It was America that would suffer the straitjacket," Pompeo told the Fox Business network. "It would be quintessentially unfair to the American people and to the American workers."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Franco-Chinese partnership'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pompeo said in a statement that the US would advocate a "realistic and pragmatic model" that included renewal energy but preserved a role for fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>French President Emmanuel Macron, who unsuccessfully tried to persuade Trump to stay in the accord named for his nation's capital, lamented the decision.</p>
      <p>"We regret this and it makes the Franco-Chinese partnership on climate and biodiversity even more necessary," the French presidency said as Macron visited China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases blamed for climate change.</p>
      <p>The US, the number-two emitter, is still planning to attend this month's COP climate negotiations in Spain, according to a State Department official.</p>
      <p>Pompeo in his statement pointed to a 13 percent US reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 to 2017 even as the economy grew.</p>
      <p>But Trump, who took office in 2017, has pledged to turn back environmental regulations as states such as California and New York try to take stronger action on their own.</p>
      <p>Trump has sought to block California from setting tighter standards on car emissions and moved to let states set their own standards on existing coal-fired power plants.</p>
      <p>Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the Trump administration has "once again thumbed its nose at our allies, turned a blind eye to the facts and further politicized the world's greatest environmental challenge".</p>
