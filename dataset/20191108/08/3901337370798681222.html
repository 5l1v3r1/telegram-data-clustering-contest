      <p>In an exclusive interview with Soccer Laduma this week, Mokwena explained that despite all the pressure currently on him, he has a ‘very strong’ backing from management.</p>
      <p>“Very strong, and I feel I’m very fortunate. When I start the race, I have three disabilities: I’m young, I’m black and I’ve never played professional football. But because of the support I get from the management and the belief they have in me… I feel that it makes up for the three disabilities that I have from the start of the race.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to feel their trust and to feel that they believe in you because once you feel that people believe in you, then you’ve got the responsibility and there’s an inner voice motivating you to say you can’t let them down. That becomes your driving force. I can’t let Dr Irvin Khoza down and I can’t let the Orlando Pirates management down and I can’t let the supporters down,” Mokwena added. </p>
