      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mason-greenwood">Mason Greenwood</a> broke one of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/WayneRooney">Wayne Rooney</a>’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterUnited">Manchester United</a> records as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s side eased to a 3-0 victory over <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/partizan-belgrade">Partizan Belgrade</a>.</p>
      <p>The young forward opened the scoring in the first half before teeing up <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/anthony-martial">Anthony Martial</a> to double United’s advantage 12 minutes later.</p>
      <p>In doing so, the 18-year-old became the club’s youngest ever player to both score and assist in the same European game.</p>
      <p>Rooney was also 18 when he first achieved the feat in 2004 against Fenerbahce in a Champions League group stage fixture.</p>
      <p>Manchester United secured their place in the knockout rounds of the Uefa Europa League with victory. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marcus-rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> scored the third goal to add further gloss to a better European night, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer given a standing ovation at full-time.</p>
      <p>“To score three goals, obviously we’re very happy,” Rashford said after the game.</p>
      <p>“It’s something we’ve been focused on as the forward players. Hopefully today is just the start of it.</p>
      <p>“He [Greenwood] has done very well. He just needs to keep knuckling down and working hard and the goals will come because he has a lot of quality.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United visit Bramall Lane to play Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
