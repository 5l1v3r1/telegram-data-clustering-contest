      <h1>DBS Bank Partners With Singapore Government to Launch Blockchain Trade Platform</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:00:20+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Pan</a></address>
      <p>Asian banking giant DBS and multinational commodity trading firm Trafigura Group are tapping blockchain to facilitate global trade.</p>
      <p>Alongside the Singapore government and the International Chamber of Commerce, these firms are looking to reduce the number of paper-based processes involved in global trade. Distributed ledger technology firm Perlin is providing the blockchain background to build the open-source platform, dubbed ICC TradeFlow.</p>
      <p>DBS claims the new platform will connect partners from different countries, reducing end-to-end document transit time from 45 days to just 20. A $20 million trade in iron ore from Africa to China is expected to be the first transaction processed, according to a press release.</p>
      <p>The ICC TradeFlow Platform is based on the Trade Trust network infrastructure provided by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which is a statutory board under the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information.</p>
      <p>The partners plan to add more enhancements to the platform as more countries join the new trade finance system. According to the release, the participants claim they can build a more trusted relationship between counterparties, adding more background information such as credit ratings on trade participants, vessels and couriers.</p>
      <p>The partnership could foster new innovations that can reinforce Singapore’s position as a leading commodity trading hub, said Satvinder Singh, assistant CEO of Enterprise Singapore, an agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry in the country.</p>
      <p>Trade finance has been one of the frontiers for enterprise blockchain adoption. The trade finance blockchain Marco Polo has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/trade-finance-blockchain-marco-polo-pilots-first-russia-germany-transactions">partnered</a> with over 20 global banks, including Bank of America, ING and BNP Paribas. It has piloted its first trading arrangement between Germany and Russia in October.</p>
      <p>A slew of Chinese state-owned banks have also launched their own blockchain trade finance platform to facilitate short-term financing between export companies and financial institutions, and the Construction Bank, one of four major commercial banks in the country, has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-banking-giant-ccb-expands-blockchain-platform-as-volume-breaks-53-billion">revamped</a> its blockchain platform with new factoring abilities as the platform’s trading volume surpasses $53 billion overall since its April 2018 launch.</p>
      <p>Trafigura itself has been involved in the blockchain space since 2017, when it participated in t<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ibm-blockchain-platform-oil-trade-finance">he development of a crude oil trade finance platform</a> alongside IBM, Natixis and Hyperledger.</p>
