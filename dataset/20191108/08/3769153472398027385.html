      <blockquote><b>Making your FPS Game Responsive</b><br/><br/>We want to use as few frames as possible to keep things responsive for the player. And the whole process doesn’t take as long as you might think!<br/><br/>We just need to make sure the frames we do use are the right ones!<br/><br/>Along the way, you’ll become a pro at...<br/><br/>● working with actions in the NLA editor and action editor<br/>● working with curves<br/>● structuring your linked files<br/>● exporting animations to Unity...and a whole lot more.<br/><br/><b>Get the Skills to Make any Type of First-Person Shooter Game</b><br/><br/>The hands and arms are all that your players see of your character, so it’s important to make those few frames expressive and interesting.<br/><br/>At the same time, they shouldn't be distracting from what your character is doing in the game.<br/><br/>I’ll be going over the do’s and don’ts of first-person animation as we go along so you’ll be prepared to take these skills and transfer them to any other type of FPS game, or any other 3D animation app for that matter.</blockquote>
