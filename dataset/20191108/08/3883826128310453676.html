        <b>Wearing glasses at work has become an emotive topic in Japan following reports that some firms have told female employees to remove them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Several local news outlets said some companies had "banned" eyewear for female employees for various reasons.</p>
      <p>Among them, some retail chains reportedly said glasses-wearing shop assistants gave a "cold impression".</p>
      <p>That has sparked heated discussion on Japanese social media over dress practices and women in the workplace.</p>
      <p>The Nippon TV network and Business Insider were among the outlets to report on the issue, which looked at how firms in different industries prohibit women from wearing glasses.</p>
      <p>They included safety reasons for airline workers, or being unable to see make-up properly for women working in the beauty sector.</p>

      <p>It was not clear whether the so-called "bans" were based on company policies, or rather reflected what was socially accepted practice in those workplaces.</p>
      <p>But the topic has led to heated debates on social media.</p>
      <p>The hashtag "glasses are forbidden" has been popular in Japan and the topic continued to attract tweets on Friday.</p>
      <p>Kumiko Nemoto, professor of sociology at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies, said people in Japan were reacting to the "outdated" policies.</p>
      <p>She said: "The reasons why women are not supposed to wear glasses... really don't make sense. It's all about gender. It's pretty discriminatory."</p>
      <p>She added that the reports reflected "old, traditional Japanese" thinking.</p>
      <p>"It's not about how women do their work. The company... values the women's appearance as being feminine and that's opposite to someone who wears glasses," Prof Nemoto said.</p>
      <p>The discussion has echoes of a recent workplace controversy in Japan over high heels.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-48504490">Actor and writer Yumi Ishikawa launched a petition calling for Japan to end dress codes</a> after being made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour.</p>
      <p>The movement attracted a stream of support and a strong social media following.</p>
      <p>Supporters tweeted the petition alongside the hashtag #KuToo in solidarity with her cause, mirroring the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>The slogan plays on the Japanese words for shoes "kutsu" and pain "kutsuu".</p>

      <p>Campaigners say that wearing high heels is seen as obligatory when applying for jobs.</p>
      <p>Supporters were further aggravated after a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-48534453">Japanese minister said it is "necessary" for companies to enforce dress codes</a> that mandated high heels.</p>
      <p>Prof Nemoto said there continues to be discussion by women in Japan "criticising the high heel" policies.</p>
      <p>"Women are evaluated mostly on their appearance," she said. "That's the message that these policies are sending, at least."</p>
