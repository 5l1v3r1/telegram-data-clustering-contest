      <p><b>Crowbar</b> frontman and only constant member <b>Kirk Windstein</b> has officially announced his new solo album, titled <i>Dream In Motion</i> and due January 24 via eOne Music, and he shared its title track. Kirk recently <a href="https://www.theprp.com/2018/04/06/news/crowbars-kirk-windstein-working-mellow-solo-album/">said</a> on Jamey Jasta’s podcast that the new album is “not an acoustic record. It’s mellow, dark music,” and added that it’s “my version of a mellow Crowbar basically.” You can definitely hear that on “Dream In Motion,” where “mellow” is being used very relatively. It pretty much sounds like if Crowbar went in a doomer direction, and it’s pretty awesome. Listen below. Also check out the tracklist, which includes a cover of Jethro Tull’s “Aqualung.”</p>
