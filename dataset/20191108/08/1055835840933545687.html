      <p><i><b>Winter isn’t the only time to enjoy this stunning region of Australia’s Alps. Visit during the warm-weather months for wildflowers, locally made beverages and a peaceful retreat. And what better way to see the glorious sights than with the timeless Mazda CX-3? Timeless in style, the Mazda CX-3 fits seamlessly into the modern classic backdrop of the Snowy Mountains. Zoom, zoom!</b></i>  </p>

        <b>WHEELS AND WALKS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many travellers to the region start their journey in nearby Canberra. It’s a leisurely two-hour drive from <b><i>NAMADGI NATIONAL PARK,</i></b> a scenic and historically rich stretch of land boasting a wealth of Aboriginal sites (including paintings at Yankee Hat), scenic views and an arboretum. The Mazda CX-3 is the perfect car to take you from city to countryside and everywhere in between. </p>

      <p>If you want to make it a weekend of exploring, zoom south to Kosciuszko National Park near Thredbo and stretch your legs along <b><i>ILLAWONG WALK</i></b>, a 5km return trek that hugs the Snowy River valley and is popular with swimmers and birdwatchers. And with space for all of your gear, including your swimmers and binoculars, the Mazda CX-3 is the perfect companion for any road trip with advanced safety and tech features.</p>
