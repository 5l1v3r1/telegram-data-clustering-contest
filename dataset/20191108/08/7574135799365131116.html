      <p>Fresh off <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/behold-the-ozzy-osbourne-and-post-malone-song/">collaborating with Post Malone</a>, <b>Ozzy Osbourne</b> has announced a new solo album, <i>Ordinary Man</i>, which is due in early 2020 via Epic. The album was made with producer/guitarist Andrew Watt (who co-produced the Ozzy/Post Malone song), <b>Guns N’ Roses</b>‘ Duff McKagan on bass, and <b>Red Hot Chili Peppers</b>‘ Chad Smith on drums. The first single “Under The Graveyard.” It’s a doomy power ballad, and I don’t know if anyone expects truly great music from Ozzy in 2019 but it’s… not half bad! Listen below. Ozzy says:</p>
      <blockquote>“It all started when [his daughter] Kelly comes in and says ‘do you want to work on a Post Malone song?’” OZZY explains. “My first thing was ‘who the fuck is Post Malone?!’ I went to Andrew’s [Watt] house and he said we will work really quick. After we finished that song, he said ‘would you be interested in starting an album.’ I said ‘that would be fucking great, but now I am thinking I don’t want to be working in a basement studio for six months! And in just a short time, we had the album done. Duff [McKagan] and Chad [Smith] came in and we would go in and jam during the day and I would go work out the songs in the evenings. I previously had said to Sharon I should be doing an album, but in the back of my mind I was going ‘I haven’t got the fucking strength…’ but Andrew pulled it out of me. I really hope people listen to it and enjoy it, because I put my heart and soul into this album.”</blockquote>
      <p>Ozzy recently had to <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/ozzy-osbourne-postpones-european-and-uk-tour-dates-again/">re-postpone Europe/UK tour dates</a> due to ongoing medical issues. He is still set to <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/ozzy-osbourne-postpones-all-2019-tour-dates-for-2020-due-to-injury/">tour North America in 2020</a>, including NYC’s Madison Square Garden on June 22</p>
