      <h1>Sex Feast: ‘Food porn’ takes a literal turn in Patpong (Photos)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:44:01+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/chayanit-at-coconuts.co" target="_blank">Chayanit Itthipongmaetee</a></address>
      <p>Three masked women walk in. The one in black leather holds a chain restraining the second with a slave collar. Blaring from the background, <i>O Fortuna </i>oversells the melodrama some as they tramp to the end of the dining table. There, the master starts whipping her sub’s bottom. It doesn’t take long until she’s ordered to kiss the third woman sitting composed in a sexy nurse costume.</p>
      <p>One of the Bangkok’s vintage red-light districts is taking its kink to another level – up or down is up to opinion – inside an art gallery-turned-fine-dining restaurant called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/outlaweroticcuisine/">Outlaw Erotic Cuisine</a>, where appetites for food and fornication are paired at sexually charged dinners.</p>
      <p>“We’re bringing new people with a desire for quality and authenticity to the oldest business and entertainment district of Bangkok – Patpong,” said Michael Messner, a co-owner whose entertainment group has been in Soi Patpong two decades with venues including Black Pagoda, The Strip, Club Black and the downstairs Barbar Fetish Club.</p>

      <p>Outlaw Erotic sits inside Candle Light Studio, which opened in March and harbors works by prominent artists such as Swiss master sci-fi surrealist H.R. Giger, Austrian sculptor-printmaker Ernst Fuchs and <i>Whore’s Glory </i>director Michael Glawogger. Street artist Headache Stencil, <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/stencil-graffiti-silenced-black-leopard-goes-viral-mysteriously-disappears/">aka “Thailand’s Banksy</a>,” and provocative watercolor artist Tawan Wattuya also fill out the collection.</p>

      <p>“It’s eating in an art gallery, and you get erotic shows,” co-owner Romain Guiot said, boiling it down as he boiled water in the kitchen. </p>
      <p>Guiot several years back opened Outlaw Creative Cuisine, a now-defunct French restaurant in Charoen Krung area and was also partner for a time in the former occult-fetish-death-arts hideaway that was Maison Close.</p>
      <p>Now in his new turf in Patpong, the chef won’t only run the kitchen and serve French-inspired fusion dishes; Guiot said he’ll invite others with culinary gifts to come and create dishes to meet varied appetites of his guests. </p>
      <p>“Guest chefs will be coming and take turns. It’s going to be like a chef’s table,” Guiot said, mentioning talents such as Weerawat “Noom” Triyasenwat (Samuay &amp; Sons in Udon Thani province), Italian chef Davide Calo (Opus Wine Bar) and Steven John (Empty Plates).</p>

      <p>Outlaw Erotic serves six courses and offers three “erotic” shows for THB3,990 per diner-voyeur. Eating while being thus entertained requires making a reservation three days in advance and a 50% deposit. Each booking can accommodate up to eight diners. </p>
      <p>“It’s about expanding the sensual experience of dining, adding a level of quality onto the street, more than just go-go erotic,” Messner said.</p>

      <p>The show continues throughout the dinner, and though touching the entertainers is verboten, they do interact with the diners.</p>
      <p>“They can blindfold customers and make them eat and more… They can do some shibari, suspension, master-and-slave game, also they can be a human chandelier. The shows are in perpetual evolution,” Romain said.</p>

      <p>Though “outlaw” is in the name, there are strictly enforced rules to be respected. First is the “no-touching” policy (only the entertainers can initiate contact with patrons). Secondly, no photos — diners must leave their phones at the entrance, but will receive photos taken and provided by the venue, according to Guiot.</p>
      <p>“We need you to savor the moment, fully experience it with all your sensories,” he said. </p>

      <p>Not intent on only providing female entertainers, Guiot said they are “very open” and willing to match everyone’s tastes and desires with male or trans performers.</p>
      <p>Outlaw Erotic Cuisine is located on the third floor on Soi Patpong 2, upstairs from the Barbar Fetish Club. It’s available via advance booking only.</p>
