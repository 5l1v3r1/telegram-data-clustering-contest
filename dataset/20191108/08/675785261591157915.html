      <h1>Logan Paul recalls being ridiculed at school for wanting to be famous ahead of KSI rematch</h1>
      <h2>Logan Paul clashes with KSI on Saturday night in Los Angeles in their long-awaited rematch as professional boxers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Logan Paul has revealed his life-long ambition to be famous - and how his class-mates ridiculed him for it.</p>
      <p>The social media influencer has been in the public eye since he was a teenager when he first started creating six-second videos on Vine.</p>
      <p>He then migrated to YouTube where he attracted a following of almost 20million to establish himself as one of the most popular influencers in the world.</p>
      <p>And on Saturday night Paul will take his earnings and perhaps his reputation into the stratosphere when he takes on KSI in their long-awaited rematch.</p>

      <p>And the Ohio native is confident he will emerge victorious because he's been proving people wrong his whole life.</p>
      <p>"In high school I wanted to be famous and everyone laughed," he said.</p>
      <p>"But everything has seemed in reach for me as long as I grab for it. This is not a one-off; it cannot be. I am too good at it to not use this skill set more."</p>
      <p>Paul fought to a draw with KSI in Manchester last year in a white-collar bout.</p>
      <p>More than a year on and the rivals have turned professional after being granted licences by the California State Athletic Commission.</p>
      <p>Anthony Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn is behind this weekend's show with the fight dividing the boxing world.</p>

      <p>But Paul insists he has taken his preparation seriously after recruiting former heavyweight world champion Shannon Briggs as his trainer.</p>
      <p>"I am taking it very seriously, like everything," he added.</p>
      <p>"This camp was more strategic and I work my ass off better than anything. The strategy last year was to work hard but I over-trained and was weak.</p>
      <p>"I was focused in travelling to travelling to Paris for a holiday with my former girlfriend.  I sparred amateurs last year and I boxed like an amateur.</p>
      <p>"This time I am sparring pros and fighting like a pro. We have not sparred a single amateur, all unbeaten pros and everyone has left on the canvas."</p>
