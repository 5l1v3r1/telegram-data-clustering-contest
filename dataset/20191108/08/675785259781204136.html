      <h1>Mohamed Salah sends title warning to Liverpool teammates ahead of Man City clash</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool can go nine points clear by beating Manchester City this weekend but Mohamed Salah is not getting carried away</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:41:07+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:41</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Mohamed Salah insists it is too early for Liverpool to be thinking about winning the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's men can go nine points clear of their rivals at the top of the table with victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> have won 10 of their last 11 matches in the Premier League and have not tasted defeat since their loss to City in January.</p>
      <p>But Salah is not getting carried away and warns Liverpool can still be clawed back, even if they pick up victory over the champions this weekend.</p>
      <p>"They were talking about that in December last year when we were six or seven points ahead," Salah told Sky Sports.</p>

      <p>"It is not over. It is three games.</p>
      <p>"If you go through a period of time and lose three games, you are in trouble.</p>
      <p>"Even if we win, it is a long way. We are in November, it is too early to talk about the Premier League."</p>
      <p>Liverpool boss Klopp and counterpart Pep Guardiola have ramped up the mind games ahead of the clash at Anfield.</p>

      <p>Klopp responded to Guardiola's comments on Sadio Mane with a jibe at City for their 'tactical fouls'.</p>
      <p>But the Liverpool boss admitted his regret this week, insisting: "If I could do it again, I wouldn’t say it again</p>
      <p>"It’s just not necessary, these kind of things. I know there is a lot of respect there.</p>
      <p>"I feel that’s how it should be. I feel all the rest will be decided on the pitch."</p>
