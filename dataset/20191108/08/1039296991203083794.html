      <h1>Renault Triber RxZ now gets 15-inch wheels as standard</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jaiveer Mehra</a></address>
      <p>Top-spec Triber RxZ now gets 15-inch rims and meatier 185/65 section tyres; prices hiked by around Rs 4,000.</p>
      <p>Renault has quietly updated the top-spec Triber RxZ with larger wheels and meatier tyres. Initially available with 14-inch steel wheels wrapped in 165/80 section tyres across all trim levels, Renault is now offering larger 15-inch units and meatier 185/65 section tyres as standard on the fully-loaded RxZ variant.</p>
      <p>As with the 14-inch units previously offered on the top trim level, the 15-inchers are steel wheels cleverly dressed-up to resemble alloy wheels; 14-inch alloys remain a paid accessory.</p>
      <p>The update has also seen a marginal revision in prices, with the RxZ now priced at Rs 6.53 lakh – around Rs 4,000 more than before. There are no other changes to the line-up.</p>
      <p>Renault launched the Triber earlier this year in a choice of four trim levels and with a single engine option – an upgraded version of the 1.0-litre unit from the Kwid, developing 72hp and 96Nm of torque and paired to a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard.</p>
      <p>The compact seven-seater – only the second such model in India after the Datsun Go+ – rivals the likes of the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/hyundai/grand-i10"><b>Hyundai Grand i10</b></a>, <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/maruti-suzuki/wagon-r"><b>Maruti Suzuki Wagon R</b></a>, <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/ford/figo"><b>Ford Figo</b></a> and the aforementioned <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/datsun/go-plus"><b>Datsun Go+</b></a>.</p>
