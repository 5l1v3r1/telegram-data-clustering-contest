      <h1>UK weather: Trapped shoppers bed down in food court due to 'biblical' flooding</h1>
      <h2>Shoppers who were stranded at Sheffield's Meadowfield shopping centre bought pyjamas from Primark, which stayed open late, and munched on free cookies handed out by Starbucks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:42:49+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>Dozens of trapped shoppers and staff bedded down inside a shopping centre overnight after a "near biblical" deluge caused some of the worst <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/floods">flooding</a> in years.</p>
      <p>Customers slept on benches inside a food court and bought pyjamas from shops at the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield as roads, car parks and homes flooded after more than a month's worth of rain fell in a single day.</p>
      <p>In Rotherham, firefighters used boats to rescue people from the Parkgate Shopping Park, where abandoned cars sat in murky brown floodwater.</p>
      <p>Residents were told to evacuate immediately after the River Don hit its highest recorded level in Doncaster as water levels surged overnight amid more than 240 flood warnings or alerts across waterlogged England.</p>
      <p>Commuters in Yorkshire and the Midlands were facing chaos on Friday with roads still under water and a number of railway lines blocked, with Northern Rail issuing a "do not travel" notice due to severe disruption.</p>

      <p>Rest centres were set up in Doncaster after the River Don burst its banks, posing a danger to life to residents living close to its banks.</p>
      <p>Some were urged to flee their homes due to the extremely dangerous situation, with the river expected to peak at 21ft (6.4 metres) later in the day.</p>
      <p>Doncaster Council tweeted on Friday morning: "The River Don is breaching at St Oswald Church, Kirk Sandall. There is a Severe Flood Warning in place for Sandal Grove, Old Kirk Sandall. Residents in these areas are advised to evacuate immediately."</p>
      <p>More than 30 homes were evacuated as a precaution in Mansfield after a mudslide in the area.</p>

      <p>Displaced homeowners in the Sheffield area will face a mess when they are able to return to their flooded homes. Totley Primary School was closed due to severe flooding in its boiler room and damage to its electrical systems.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency has warned people to stay out of floodwater and avoid raging rivers or streams because they risk being swept away following one of the wettest days in years.</p>
      <p>Severe flood warnings, meaning "danger to life", were issued at five points along the River Don, while 119 warnings, meaning "immediate action required", were in place, mostly in Yorkshire, as of Friday at 8.30am.</p>
      <p>Floodwater was waist deep in places in the Sheffield area after almost 85mm of rain - more than the city's averages for the entire month of November - fell in 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of people were kept inside Sheffield's Meadowhall shopping centre due to flooded roads and gridlocked traffic outside.</p>
      <p>Dozens were forced to spend the night in the shopping centre, which cancelled its Christmas Live event at the last minute after hundreds of shoppers had already arrived.</p>
      <p>Five Guys worker Luke Turner, from Chesterfield, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-leeds-50262499">BBC</a> he couldn't drive home after his shift, so he slept in a stockroom and used "aprons" as a pillow.</p>
      <p>Rosie De Roeck, 16, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, said her mum was able to rescue her just before 1am after she spent about nine hours stranded at the shopping centre.</p>

      <p>Describing the ordeal as "quite scary", she said many shoppers bought pyjamas from Primark, which stayed open late.</p>
      <p>Starbucks handed out free cookies and a stranded shopper was giving out bags of crisps he had purchased.</p>
      <p>In Rotherham, abandoned cars were still trapped in murky brown water at the Parkgate Shopping Park as water levels remained high on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>On Thursday evening, boats were brought in to rescue shoppers who were who trapped.</p>

      <p>South Yorkshire Police said there had been "significant issues" in Doncaster, with Bentley, Toll Bar and Scawthorpe the worst affected areas.</p>
      <p>The River Don was among the worst affected, having flooded the Rotherham railway station and other areas. Places along the river were still under water on Friday.</p>
      <p>A number of houses were evacuated after they were inundated in the village of Whiston, near Rotherham, and, in Sheffield, the council closed Millhouses Park, where a 14-year-old boy was swept to his death in the River Sheaf during the devastating floods in the city in 2007.</p>
      <p>Northern Rail said it expected "severe disruption" to its network, with services unable to run between Sheffield and Gainsborough Central or Lincoln Central.</p>

      <p>Services have also been suspended between Sheffield and Leeds via Moorthorpe following the deluge.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has predicted the flooding rains will clear and move south-east through the day on Friday, but many flood warnings are expected to remain in place for the next few days with further rain in places at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The highest rainfall in the country on Thursday was recorded at Swineshaw in the Peak District, which had 112mm (4.4ins) in the 24 hours to 2am.</p>
      <p>A Met Office spokesman said: "There were a lot of other places that had 80 millilitres or more, especially in Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>"The rains should clear by lunchtime, with a fine weekend ahead, but the flood warnings will stay in place for quite a while."</p>
