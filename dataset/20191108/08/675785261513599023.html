      <h2>Nathan Thursfield, from Stoke on Trent, now wants his face changed so he looks like Kylie Jenner instead</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:36:05+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:36</time> by <a rel="author">Hayley Parker</a></address>
      <p>A young man who spent £80,000 to look like his idol <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> is now considering tweaking himself so he resembles <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> .</p>
      <p>Nathan Thursfield has had numerous procedures on his face in a bid to capture the striking look of former glamour model Katie.</p>
      <p>Although he has irreversibly changed his look and no longer resembles the fresh-faced teenager he once was, the 24-year-old has dropped Katie as his official inspiration, <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/nathan-thursfield-katie-price-kylie-3511767">Stoke Sentinel reported.</a></p>
      <p>Nathan feels Peter Andre's ex has tweaked herself too much, leading him towards American reality TV's Jenner instead.</p>

      <p>"I used to admire Katie’s surgery journey now I fear she is going a little too far especially with her face, but she definitely looks fabulous still," he said. "I know my limits.</p>
      <p>"I do think Kylie Jenner looks fab. Maybe I will change my face to look like hers. That would be the next outrageous thing."</p>

      <p>Nathan and Katie have crossed paths before.</p>
      <p>When Nathan appeared on Loose Women with Katie, she said he looked perfect.</p>
      <p>Recently Nathan set off on a trip to Turkey where he was booked in to the same clinic Katie uses.</p>

      <p>There he will fork out £7,000 for a smile makeover.</p>
      <p>It will be the latest in a long list of bodily tweaks Nathan has opted for included chin fillers, cheek fillers, lip fillers, botox and liposuction on his arms and back and three nose jobs - despite medics warning it could fall off.</p>
      <p>"I’ve had my teeth shaven down to start the treatment - they look like little baby shark teeth," he explained.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"It took four hours and I've got to come back for another five hours for fitting and more shaving.</p>
      <p>"I speak to Katie, so she gave advice and told me her experience, so that’s why I chose to come here."</p>
      <p>Nathan's advice for those considering going down the plastic surgery route is likely to ruffle the feathers of those who promote body positivity and acceptance.</p>

      <p>"I must admit if there is something I dislike about myself or my body, I will change it," he said.</p>
      <p>"I advise anyone the same when they ask me. If it bothers you that much then change it, however make sure you research surgeons and companies.</p>
      <p>"The majority just want your money then provide the worst aftercare."</p>

      <p>The health care worker raises money for his operations through TV appearances and magazine deals, including selling footage of his Las Vegas wedding to now husband Michael Gibbons for £12,000.</p>
      <p>"I work hard so I use my own money," Nathan said.</p>
      <p>"I don’t ask for anything of anyone, never have done. It’s my money so I spend it on what I want, I have a gorgeous home and live a comfortable lifestyle.</p>

      <p>"I did get in debt when I was younger and naive and that funded my first nose job however I owe nobody anything now, I’m sensible with money."</p>
      <p>In the next year Nathan will appear in a documentary about cosmetic surgery and a fitness series on MTV.</p>
