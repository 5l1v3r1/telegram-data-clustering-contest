      <p>MEXICO CITY: Mexico's Mormons, who are mourning nine women and children killed in a massacre, have roots in the country going back to the late 1800s, but live under the constant threat of the criminal gangs they have dared to defy.</p>
      <p>Here are five fast facts on this deeply devout community.</p>

        <b>BREAKAWAYS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), or Mormon church, set up headquarters in Utah in 1847 when the territory was still Mexico.</p>
      <p>The land passed to the United States the following year, after the Mexican-American War. But it remained a remote outpost where the Mormons were free to practice their faith on the shores of the Great Salt Lake.</p>
      <p>That started changing after the US Civil War ended in 1865, when Washington began cracking down on a key Mormon tradition: polygamy.</p>
      <p>Fleeing persecution, Mormons began arriving in northern Mexico's Sierra Madre mountains in 1875.</p>
      <p>"That's how Mexico became the first country in Latin America where the Mormons settled," says Francisco Jara, an expert on Mormonism.</p>
      <p>Many Mormons in Mexico have broken with the mainstream church, which has banned polygamy.</p>
      <p>The LeBaron family, which lost six members in Monday's massacre, belongs to the Church of the Firstborn, a breakaway founded in 1924 in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. It has 5,000 members, according to community leader Julian LeBaron.</p>
      <p>
        <b>POLYGAMY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joseph Smith, Mormonism's founder and one of its prophets, said he received a divine revelation on the godliness of "plural marriage."</p>
      <p>The Mormon church endorsed polygamy until 1891, when it ended the practice under pressure from US authorities.</p>
      <p>Around 40 Mormon breakaway sects still practice polygamy in Mexico, according to Jara.</p>
      <p>But they are often discreet about it.</p>
      <p>Community members told AFP that Dawna Langford, one of the victims, was her husband's second wife. But relatives were reluctant to talk to the media about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ONE MILLION MEMBERS?</b>
      </p>
      <p>LDS says there are 1.2 million Mormons in Mexico, making it the second-largest Mormon community in the world after the US.</p>
      <p>However, Mexico's last census counted 314,932 in 2010.</p>
      <p>The Mexico City government attributed the difference to the fact that many Mormons in Mexico belong to breakaway groups and refuse to consider themselves part of the mainstream church.</p>
      <p>
        <b>VIGILANTES</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is bad blood between northern Mexico's Mormons and the drug cartels that operate in the often lawless border region.</p>
      <p>In May 2009, a criminal group kidnapped teenager Erick LeBaron in Chihuahua, demanding US$1 million in ransom. The community refused, and LeBaron was freed.</p>
      <p>After that, the LeBaron clan armed themselves and launched vigilante patrols. Most have dual US-Mexican nationality, which afforded them a degree of protection from criminal gangs wary of Washington's attention.</p>
      <p>One, Benjamin LeBaron, founded a crime-fighting group called SOS Chihuahua that advocated for a crackdown on drug cartel violence.</p>
      <p>According to Mexican media reports, the cartels in the area were incensed.</p>
      <p>A group of 17 gunmen killed Benjamin and his brother-in-law in July 2009.</p>
      <p>The family continues to help organise regular "peace caravans."</p>
      <p>They reject the Mexican government's assertion their relatives were caught in the crossfire between warring cartels, saying they believe the group was deliberately targeted.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WATER WARS</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Mexican media reports, the LeBarons have also been involved in disputes with local farmers over water, a scarce resource in the arid north.</p>
