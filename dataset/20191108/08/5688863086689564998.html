      <p>"He will be free to play from [November 16], so of course he will be considered for selection. I can't make any commitment to whether he will be back, but we will certainly discuss his selection," Rege was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.</p>
      <p>The MCA had announced the squad for of Mumbai the first three fixtures only since key players like <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shreyas_iyer">Shreyas </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/iyer">Iyer</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shardul_thakur">Shardul Thakur</a>, and Shivam Dube have been called up for India's ongoing three-match T20I series against Bangladesh.  By the time Shaw becomes eligible to play again, Mumbai will have played six of their seven group games. </p>
