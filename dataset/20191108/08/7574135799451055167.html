      <p><b>King Diamond</b> is <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/king-diamond-announces-new-album-tour-with-uncle-acid-idle-hands/">on tour now with Uncle Acid and Idle Hands</a> as he gears up to release his new album <i>The Institute</i> in 2020 via Metal Blade, and now he has officially released the new single “Masquerade of Madness,” which he’s been playing live all year. It’s pretty much classic King Diamond — militant rhythms, soaring falsettos, shredding solos — and it sounds great. Listen below.</p>
      <p>The King Diamond tour just hit Brooklyn’s Kings Theatre last night, 11/7 (where King Diamond performed this song), and we’ll have more on that very soon but meanwhile you can check out the setlist below. Next year, King Diamond’s classic band Mercyful Fate will <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/mercyful-fate-announce-first-shows-in-20-years/">reunite</a> for their first shows in 20+ years.</p>
