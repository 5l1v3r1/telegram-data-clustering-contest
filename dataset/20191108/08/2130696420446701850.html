      <p>THE following companies saw new developments that may affect trading of their securities on Friday:</p>
      <p><b>Eagle Hospitality Trust (EHT):</b> More clarity over the condition of EHT’s Queen Mary floating hotel is expected as soon as this month, when <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/peer-review-of-reports-on-ehts-queen-mary-in-the-works">a peer review of the critical repair</a> and maintenance issues is expected to be completed. Separately, the City of Long Beach in California also noted that Urban Commons, the ship’s operator and EHT’s sponsor, had given the City a draft copy of its 2018 financial report.

      <p><b>SPH Reit:</b> The retail real estate investment trust is expanding its footprint in Australia, with a <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sph-reit-takes-a670m-stake-in-south-australia-mall">deal for a half-stake in a freehold mall</a>. The transaction with Lendlease Real Estate Investments carries a price tag of A$670 million (S$627.9 million), to be funded by a recent perp issue, plus debt and/or equity fund-raising. SPH Reit units lost S$0.01 or 0.87 per cent to S$1.14 on Thursday before the announcement.</p>

      <p><b>Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust (LMIRT):</b> Its third-quarter <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/q3-dpu-for-lippo-malls-indonesia-retail-trust-up">distribution per unit (DPU) rose to 0.56 Singapore cent</a>, from 0.49 cent a year ago. Distributable income increased by 29.5 per cent year on year to S$18 million, as net property income grew 11.8 per cent to S$44.1 million.

      <p><b>Genting Singapore:</b> Net profit <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/genting-q3-profit-dips-ploughs-on-with-rws-20">tumbled 24.5 per cent to S$158.9 million</a> in the third quarter, weighed down by “headwinds”, the Resorts World Sentosa operator said on Thursday after market close. Business expenses deepened the woe from a revenue decline of 6.7 per cent, on a double-digit drop in gaming takings from the Singapore integrated resort business. Genting shares ended 0.5 Singapore cent or 0.52 per cent higher at S$0.96 before the results.</p>

      <p><b>MindChamps PreSchool:</b> The mainboard-listed early childhood education player saw its <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/mindchamps-q3-net-profit-plunges-by-731-to-s300000-on-expansion-related-costs">third-quarter earnings plummet on higher expenses</a>, despite an increase in turnover from new pre-schools.

      <p><b>HRnetGroup:</b> Its third-quarter net profit <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/hrnetgroup-q3-profit-down-49-to-s12m-after-revaluation-of-securities">declined 4.9 per cent to S$12 million</a>, the mainboard-listed recruitment firm said in a bourse filing on Friday morning.

The manager blamed the lower DPU on a weakening yuan, as well as “technical timing difference between the loan drawdown and completion of acquisition of Fuzhou E-Commerce”. Its units closed unchanged at S$0.74.</p>
