      <p>Two ships, of which one is thought to be a sister ship to the Swedish warship Vasa, were found in the archipelago near Stockholm this week.</p>
      <p>The ship from the 17th century was found in a strait near Vaxholm on Tuesday (November 5).</p>
      <p>Marine archaeologist Jim Hansson who found the war ship, said divers found the wreck in an area where several vessels are known to be at the bottom of the sea.</p>
      <p>Hansson said samples had been taken from the ship that he hoped would give more clues about which ship it may be.</p>
      <p>A warship in the Swedish navy, Vasa sank in 1628 after setting sail on its maiden voyage. It is now in a museum after being salvaged in 1961 after 333 years at the bottom of the sea. Vasa is considered the world's best preserved 17th century ship.</p>
