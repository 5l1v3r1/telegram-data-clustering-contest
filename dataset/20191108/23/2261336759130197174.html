      <h1>UFC Moscow betting odds: Zabit comfortably favored over Calvin Kattar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T23:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Mercado</a></address>
      <p><i>Privet!</i> It’s time for another early morning MMA event for U.S. fans. UFC Moscow goes down this Saturday from the CSKA Arena in Russia. And Bloody Elbow is back again with the betting lines.</p>
      <p>The main card starts at 11:00am ET, and will be capped off with a top tier featherweight showdown between Zabit Magomedsharipov and Calvin Kattar. The Russian is well favored on home soil. Zabit’s moneyline opened up at -270, and is still at that mark today. As for the American, Kattar is on deck as the betting underdog, currently sitting at a value of +255.</p>
      <p>The over/under for this 145-pound main event has been set at 2.5 rounds. The ‘over’ is strongly favored here, registering at -197, with a +174 comeback on the ‘under.’ The bookies seem to believe that this one will reach the scorecards. The exotic bet ‘Fight goes to decision’ owns a minus line of -175. Going back the other way, the line for ‘Fight doesn’t go to decision’ holds a dog tag of +145.</p>
      <p>In the co-main event slot for UFC Moscow, Alexander Volkov will face short notice MMA noob Greg Hardy. It’s no big shocker to see Volkov heavily favored here, over a 5-1 opponent whose biggest asset is raw athleticism. The Russian is on the table at -255, with the polarizing American underdogging at +235.</p>
      <p>The over/under for this clash of heavyweights has been assessed at 1.5 rounds. Both props hold minus lines here. The ‘over’ is available at -112, with the ‘under’ being an option at -103. The oddsmakers don’t seem to be projecting the co-main event to last a full 15-minutes. Bettors can lay the price on ‘Fight doesn’t go to decision’ for -280, or take the price on ‘Fight goes to decision’ for +220. No inhaler will be allowed in this one.</p>
      <p>There are a set of pick’em fights on the UFC Moscow undercard. Middleweight matchup Karl Roberson vs. Roman Kopylov and woman’s bantamweight bout Jessica-Rose Clark vs. Pannie Kianzad involve each fighter as a -105 option respectively. Another fight projected to be a close one is Anthony Rocco Martin vs. Ramadan Emeev at welterweight. Emeev can only be found with a negative mark on his moneyline, clocking in at -120. Martin is currently at both plus and minus odds, ranging from -105 up to +116.</p>
