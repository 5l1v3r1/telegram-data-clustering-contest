      <p>Thirteen years after the original "High School Musical" movie first premiered, East High is getting a new series on the Disney+ streaming service that's set to launch next week.</p>
      <p>It's called "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series" and the pilot episode will air for one night only on ABC, Disney Channel and Freeform at 8 p.m. ET/PT | 7 p.m. CT on Friday, Nov. 8. The full series will be made available on Disney+, which debuts Tuesday, Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>The show will follow a group of 10 drama students and faculty members at East High as the characters audition and put on the school's first-ever production of "High School Musical: The Musical."</p>
      <p>"'High School Musical: The Musical: The Series' is a re-imagining of the original 'High School Musical,'" said Joshua Bassett, who plays Ricky.</p>
      <p>Sofia Wylie plays Gina Porter, a transfer student at the school.</p>
      <p>"She's a fun character, she's kind of like the mean girl, she's very mysterious, mischievous," Wylie said.</p>
      <p>Matt Cornett plays E.J.</p>
      <p>"E.J. is not the mean boy," Cornett said. "He's going to do whatever he can to keep what he loves and sometimes gets himself in trouble."</p>
      <p>Olivia Rodrigo, who plays Nini, said one theme in the show is "finding your tribe."</p>
      <p>"I think towards the end of the series, we kind of realize that the drama kids are all kind of a group, and how important that is in high school - to find people that support you and love you unconditionally," Rodrigo said.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will also offer other original shows and movies including "The Mandalorian," "The World According to Jeff Goldblum" and "Lady and the Tramp."</p>
