"He's going to do whatever he can to keep what he loves and sometimes gets himself in trouble."<br/><br/>Olivia Rodrigo, who plays Nini, said one theme in the show is "finding your tribe."<br/><br/>"I think towards the end of the series, we kind of realize that the drama kids are all kind of a group, and how important that is in high school - to find people that support you and love you unconditionally," Rodrigo said.<br/><br/>Disney+ will also offer other original shows and movies including "The Mandalorian," "The World According to Jeff Goldblum" and "Lady and the Tramp."<br/><br/><a href="http://disneyplus.com/?cid=DTCI-Synergy-ABCOwnedTV-Site-Awareness-Originals-US-DisneyPlus-HighSchoolMusicalSeries-EN-ArticleLink-ABCOTVWLSHSMTMTSPreview-NA">Click here to learn more about Disney+.</a><br/><br/><i>The Walt Disney Company is the parent company of this television station.</i></p>
