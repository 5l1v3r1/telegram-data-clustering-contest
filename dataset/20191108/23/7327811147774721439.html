      <p>JAMESBURG, New Jersey (WABC) -- The son of one of the victims has been arrested and charged with murder and aggravated arson in a <a href="https://abc7ny.com/2-dead-in-fast-moving-fire-that-tore-through-nj-home/5675632/">stabbing and fast-moving fire</a> that left two people dead in New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Firefighters arrived at the house on Sheridan Street in Jamesburg at approximately 3:45 a.m. Wednesday to find heavy flames that caused extensive damage to the structure.</p>
      <p>The bodies of 53-year-old Clifford Kitchen and a family friend were discovered a short time later, and officials said the autopsies revealed that had both been stabbed.</p>
      <p>On Friday, authorities announced that 21-year-old Jaree Kitchen had been taken into custody and charged with two counts of first-degree murder, second-degree aggravated arson, hindering prosecution, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and destroying physical evidence.</p>
      <p>The victim's sister, Lawanda Kitchen, told Eyewitness News that her brother had a huge heart and would often allow struggling individuals to stay at his house until they got back on their feet.</p>
      <p>"He would never turn anyone away," she said. "If he had a friend in need, he would open his doors to anybody."</p>
      <p>The investigation is active and is continuing. Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Sergeant Jason Muller of the Jamesburg Police Department at (732) 521-0011, or Detective Deon McCall of the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office at (732) 745-3848.</p>
