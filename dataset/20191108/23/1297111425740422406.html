      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T23:35:42+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 23:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is offering to meet with Saskatchewan’s premier “at the earliest opportunity” to prepare for a first ministers meeting at which Western alienation is sure to take centre stage.</p>
      <p>Trudeau made the offer in a letter to Premier Scott Moe dated Nov. 7. That’s one week after Moe sent his own letter calling on the prime minister to pause the carbon tax, reform equalization and expand pipelines. He called it a “new deal for Canada.”</p>
      <p>Moe had challenged Trudeau to an in-person meeting and called it disappointing when the prime minister failed to promptly set a date. The two leaders spoke over the phone shortly after a federal election that stripped the Liberals of all of their seats in Saskatchewan and Alberta.</p>
      <p>Trudeau acknowledged those communications in his Thursday letter and committed to “collaborate and work together on shared priorities and other issues.”</p>
      <p>“I greatly appreciated the opportunity to speak with you following the recent federal election,” the prime minister wrote, according to a copy provided through Moe’s office.</p>
      <p>“To that end, I would like to meet you at the earliest opportunity as our officials work together to discuss the timing and approach for the next First Ministers’ Meeting,” Trudeau wrote.</p>
      <p>First ministers meetings bring together federal, provincial and territorial leaders to discuss co-operation on issues of national concern. The December 2018 meeting, held in Montreal, focused on internal and international trade. Previous meetings have focused on climate change and the economy.</p>
      <p>Moe is chair of the Council of the Federation, a body that promotes collaboration between provincial and territorial premiers but does not include the prime minister.</p>
      <p>In a statement sent to the Leader-Post on Friday, Moe’s press secretary pointed to Trudeau’s commitment on election night to support Alberta and Saskatchewan, despite their stinging rebuke of the Liberals.</p>
      <p>“The Prime Minister will have the opportunity to demonstrate how he will act on his own words from election night to address the frustrations of the West and support Saskatchewan people when he meets with Premier Moe,” wrote Jim Billington.</p>
      <p>Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has been calling for a first ministers meeting to discuss Western frustrations over equalization and pipelines. He has proposed a date soon after Trudeau is slated to unveil a new cabinet, tentatively set for Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>But Trudeau did not commit to any specific date or agenda for the proposed first ministers meeting in his letter to Moe, nor did he propose a specific date for their preliminary meeting.</p>
      <p>Billington signalled that Moe will stay on script in his upcoming talks with the prime minister.</p>
      <p>“Premier Moe is focused on a new deal with Canada, a plan that would take immediate steps to address the frustrations of Saskatchewan people by putting a pause on the carbon tax, addressing the inequity of the equalization formula, and taking meaningful steps to enhance market access for Saskatchewan exports,” he wrote.</p>
