      <p>You can’t get away from Little Mix at the moment.</p>
      <p>They are everywhere, from promoting their new TV talent show, to taking on the Big Apple - by dominating Times Square with sizzling PrettyLittleThing billboards.</p>
      <p>It's not surprising that they have a huge following, with their fabulous style, great vocals and pure sass. </p>
      <p>My seven year old daughter literally screamed the place down when I revealed we were going to see the quartet on the LM5 tour, and I admit I was almost as excited.</p>
      <p>Thousands packed out the Resorts World Arena for the second of a three night stint in Birmingham and the girls absolutely smashed it.</p>

      <p>It's hard to believe that it's been eight years since Jade Thirlwall , Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson and Leigh-Anne Pinnock, were first thrown together on the X-Factor.</p>
      <p>Now onto their fifth album, Little Mix have stormed on as many of their pop peers have fallen by the wayside.</p>
      <p>The concert kicked off in a predictable way - pyrotechnics, synchronised dancing and skimpy outfits. Give the crowd what they want...</p>
      <p>With a girl power theme from the start, the girls started with Salute 'representing all the women.  Then came Power and Woman Like Me. The atmosphere was fantastic from the start with positive energy filling the arena.</p>
      <p>The dance moves were great, the several outfit changes impressive and the stage management all adding to the show. What the girls don't often get credit for is their vocals but the double header of The Cure and Secret Love Song was enough to silence critics.</p>

      <p>The epic ballad, which has become an anthem for the LGBT community, provided one of the big highlights of the night as the girls glided above the audience and rainbow confetti burst from cannons.</p>
      <p>Then when the tempo was stepped back up the arena was in full party mood, everybody on their feet dancing, punching the air and generally having the best night.</p>
      <p>My seven-year old sang along as she looked on in amazement at her idols. The messages of empowerment and feminism may have appeared lost on her but she understood that these girls worked hard and believed in themselves in order to achieve their dreams and that is a good enough message for her to take away.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A truly memorable night. If you have tickets for the tour, get ready to party!</p>
      <p>Little Mix are in Birmingham on November 9 before continuing their UK tour.</p>
