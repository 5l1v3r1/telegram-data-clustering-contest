      <p><b>MEXICO CITY (AP)</b> - Descendants of Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and Aztec emperor Moctezuma met Friday in Mexico City to mark the 500th anniversary of their forebearers' first encounter.</p>
      <p>The hope was that the meeting, at a colonial church where Cortés is buried, would go better than the one 500 years ago.</p>
      <p>Federico Acosta, a Mexican who traces his lineage back 16 generations to Moctezuma's daughter, embraced Ascanio Pignatelli of Italy in a bear hug.</p>
      <p>"I want to ask your forgiveness for all the bad things that happened," said Pignatelli, who is descended from Cortes' daughter.</p>
      <p>"We need to leave the past behind us," Pignatelli said. "Today is a day for leaving all the bad things in the past."</p>
      <p>Asked if Mexico needed an apology from Spain, Acosta said no.</p>
      <p>"In the end, we are all family now," he said.</p>
      <p>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, however, disagrees.</p>
      <p>"I still ask the king of Spain and Pope Francis, humbly, that they apologize for the abuses committed during the conquest and the colonial domination," López Obrador said during a visit to Yucatan state after Acosta and Pignatelli's hug.</p>
      <p>Acosta is quite sure of his lineage: up until the 1930s, his family received a pension granted by the government to Moctezuma's descendants.</p>
      <p>And Pignatelli's family had inherited one of Cortes' noble titles, until they sold it.</p>
      <p>The two shook hands and said they hoped the anniversary would serve to unite, not divide people.</p>
      <p>Cortés and his 400 men were met by Moctezuma at the entrance to Tenochtitlan, the Aztec name for the capital.</p>
      <p>Moctezuma greeted them courteously and showered them with gifts, hoping to convince them to go away.</p>
      <p>He didn't realize his gifts just whetted their avarice; the Spaniards bullied their way into Moctezuma's palace, first as guests, and then as captors.</p>
      <p>The Aztecs tired of their emperor's weakness and chased Cortés out of Tenochtitlan.</p>
      <p>Cortés regrouped and conquered the city by 1521.</p>
      <p>In March, López Obrador, asked Spain for an apology for the Conquest, in which millions of indigenous people died from violence and disease.</p>
      <p>Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said Spain "will not issue these apologies that have been requested," and it seemed the case was closed until López Obrador raised it again Friday.</p>
      <p>"It's no insult," López Obrador said. "On the contrary, we reconcile and apologize for the injustices of other times so that, reconciled, we look ahead toward the future as the brothers we are."</p>
