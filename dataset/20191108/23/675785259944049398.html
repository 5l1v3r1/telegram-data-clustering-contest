      <h2>Coronation Street fans are worried that a miserable fate for Shona Ramsey is inevitable after marrying David Platt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T23:04:14+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 23:04</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>Shona Ramsey is set to leave the cobbles but after a happy reunion with David Platt, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> viewers fear that her exit could be tragic.</p>
      <p>Last night, viewers watched as David was released from jail and married Shona in a sweet ceremony.</p>
      <p>But, considering she will be leaving as actress Julia Goulding goes on maternity leave, it looks like the couple won't have a happy ending.</p>
      <p>This prompted fans to flock to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to speculate.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "With @juliagoulding set to go off on Maternity leave sooner rather than later &amp; David &amp; Shona finally married what possible reason could she have for leaving? Under threat from the bloke's from the Prison? Death? #Corrie."</p>

      <p>While another suggested: "Is this where a couple of nights is going to turn into many months? because Shona will be going on maternity leave? @itvcorrie #CoronationStreet #Corrie."</p>
      <p>A third remarked: "Omg what Gail just said about tempting fate, with Shona. What if Shona gets banged up for murder ? Idk who she'd murder or be accused of murdering. Cos she's coming out of the street for a bit. #Corrie #coronationstreet."</p>
      <p>"How the hell does Shona leave then. Another death? I bet it's Gary..... LOL #corrie," another joked.</p>
      <p>Julia, who has starred in the ITV soap since 2016, revealed that she was expecting a baby back in May this year.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old is looking forward to welcoming her first child with husband Ben Silver and told fans: "Ben and I are delighted to announce that we are expecting our first baby at the end of this year!</p>
      <p>"We are absolutely overjoyed and canâ€™t wait to meet our little one!"</p>
