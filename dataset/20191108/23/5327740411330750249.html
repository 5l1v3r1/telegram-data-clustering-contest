      <h1>B.C. gives Vancouver $1 million for proposed Chinese-Canadian museum</h1>
      <h2>George Chow, B.C.’s minister of state for trade, says people told him that stories need to be told</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T23:40:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 23:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/canadian-press-2/" target="_blank">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>The B.C. government is giving the City of Vancouver $1 million to help establish a Chinese-Canadian museum with the goal of creating hubs in other communities to share the history and experience of Chinese immigrants across the province.</p>
      <p>The province says this so-called hub-and-spoke model is inspired by feedback from public meetings earlier this year.</p>
      <p>George Chow, B.C.’s minister of state for trade, says people told him that stories need to be told throughout the province in order to highlight moments of significance in Chinese-Canadian history in the places where they happened.</p>
      <p>The province says people also called for the museum to celebrate the importance of Chinese immigrants who helped build British Columbia, and to bridge history with contemporary culture.</p>
      <p>Bill Yee, who was the first Chinese-Canadian elected to city council in 1982, says he hopes the museum and its hubs will unite the Chinese community, especially people who don’t live near Vancouver’s historic Chinatown.</p>
      <p>A new office for the proposed museum featuring a small gallery of photos and stories opened at a Chinese cultural centre in the city today.</p>
      <p>The museum is also part of a joint effort by the province and Vancouver to have the city’s Chinatown designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
