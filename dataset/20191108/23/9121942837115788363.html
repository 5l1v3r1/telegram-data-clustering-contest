      <h1>Fire breaks out at University District commercial building</h1>

      <p>Seattle firefighters responded to a fire in the University District that spread to a commercial building on University Way Friday night while the street was filled with students.</p>
      <p>No one was in the building and no injuries have been reported, said Seattle Fire spokesman David Cuerpo. The primary fire was extinguished around 11 p.m.</p>
      <p>The fire started about 9:45 p.m. in an alley behind University Way at Northeast 43rd Street, Cuerpo said. It was not immediately clear how the fire began, but it spread to a car in the alleyway and an adjacent building in the 4200 block of University Way Northeast.</p>
      <p>The fire is “relatively small,” but officials were exercising caution as the fire exposed electrical lines and because of the number of people in the area, Cuerpo said.</p>
      <p>“Because it’s a Friday night on University Ave, there are quite a few people around,” he said.</p>
      <p>Seattle City Light crews were working Friday night to cut power to the building, which houses businesses including Flowers Bar &amp; Restaurant and Cedars of Lebanon.</p>
