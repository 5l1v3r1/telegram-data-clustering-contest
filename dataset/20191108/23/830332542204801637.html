      <p>GREEN BAY, Wis. - A 14-year-old girl from Green Bay had an amazing moment while deer hunting after she shot two bucks using only one arrow.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://fox11online.com/news/local/lakeshore/green-bay-girl-shoots-two-bucks-with-one-arrow-in-door-county">WLUK-TV</a>, Matiah Christensen was north of Sturgeon Bay when the impressive feat happened.</p>
      <p>"I did not think I got both of them at first," said Christensen. "I was like in shock."</p>
      <p>Christensen told reporters she had no interest in one of the deer that came by.</p>
      <p>"A three-pointer walked out and we were like 'OK, it's a buck, but it's really small,'" said Christensen. "So, we waited for it to go by."</p>
      <p> WLUK-TV said the deer returned over an hour later with some does and an eight-point buck. After taking the shot, Christensen followed a blood trail.</p>
      <p>"There was a long blood trail so we figured it must have went through the eight-pointer and deflected off a rib and sliced the three-pointer's neck," said Christensen.</p>
      <p>Christensen decided to keep the eight-point buck using one tag, and the state's Department of Natural Resources allowed her to keep the three-pointer's antlers. According to WLUK-TV, she is planning to hang up both along with the special arrow.</p>
