      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The federal government has on Friday decided to remove former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL) following his deteriorating health, sources privy to Dunya News reported. </p>
      <p>The interior ministry will write a letter to the federal cabinet and the erstwhile premier’s name will be removed from the ECL after approval. The interior ministry had received an application from the Sharif family seeking removal of Nawaz’s name from the ECL.</p>
      <p>The plea was submitted for Nawaz Sharif’s treatment abroad. The Sharif family had tasked Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif to submit the application.</p>

        <b>Nawaz’s deteriorating health</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The doctors at the Sharif Medical City Hospital recommended shifting the erstwhile premier abroad for treatment as his platelets count has dropped below 30,000.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz said her father, Nawaz Sharif, must go anywhere around the world where his treatment is possible.</p>
      <p>Maryam Nawaz talked to media outside an accountability court (AC) in Lahore and maintained that it is another debate whether Nawaz Sharif is willing for treatment abroad.</p>
      <p>She told that the PML-N supreme leader’s health is still very critical as his platelets count is not getting stable despite medication. Nawaz Sharif’s platelets dropped yesterday as well and doctors are not able to identify his disease, Maryam said.</p>
      <p>Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday had been discharged from Lahore’s Services Hospital, where he was undergoing a medical treatment for 16 days due to fluctuation in his platelets count.</p>

        <b>Nawaz, Shehbaz and Maryam going abroad</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Nawaz Sharif is likely to leave for London next week along with Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz for medical treatment, sources privy to Dunya News reported.</p>
      <p>Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif will presumably accompany elder brother Nawaz Sharif and has cancelled all other engagements.</p>
      <p>Maryam Nawaz has contacted her legal team and decided to file miscellaneous petition to get her passport back which was submitted in the Lahore High Court following her bail approval. The counsels also met Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Nawaz Sharif granted bail</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) had granted Nawaz Sharif bail for eight weeks to obtain medical treatment on October 29. The PML-N supremo was ordered to deposit two bail bonds worth Rs2 million each.</p>
      <p>A two-judge bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani heard Shehbaz Sharif’s request to grant Nawaz Sharif bail on medical grounds in the Al-Azizia corruption reference.</p>
      <p>On October 25, the Lahore High Court (LHC) had bailed Nawaz Sharif indefinitely on medical grounds, days after he was taken to Services Hospital from Kot Lakhpat Jail after deterioration of his health.</p>
      <p>The ruling had come after doctors confirmed Nawaz Sharif was suffering from an autoimmune blood disorder requiring immediate medical attention.</p>
