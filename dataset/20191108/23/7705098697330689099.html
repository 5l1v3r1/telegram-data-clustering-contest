      <h1>Marvel Hires Showrunners for She-Hulk and Moon Knight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T23:45:52+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>During this summer’s D23 festivities, Kevin Feige made waves when he announced that Marvel Studios is developing even more TV shows for Disney+. New series featuring <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/she-hulk"><b>She-Hulk</b></a>, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/moon-knight"><b>Moon Knight</b></a>, and <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/ms-marvel"><b>Ms. Marvel</b></a> are hitting the streaming service in the coming years. Now, Marvel has taken big steps toward getting two of these projects off the ground. Via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rick-morty-scribe-write-marvels-she-hulk-1253300?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the studio has just recruited head writers for <b>She-Hulk</b> and <b>Moon Knight</b>.</p>
      <p>Jessica Gao is Marvel’s choice to spearhead <b>She-Hulk</b>, which will introduce Bruce Banner’s cousin Jennifer Walters into the MCU. Gao is a veteran of Adult Swim’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/rick-and-morty"><b>Rick and Morty</b></a>. Last year, she won a Primetime Emmy for writing the fan-favorite “Pickle Rick” episode of that series. Gao has also written for HBO’s <b>Silicon Valley</b> and Seeso’s <b>Take My Wife</b>. Gao actually won’t be the first <b>Rick and Morty</b> scribe to tackle one of Marvel’s Disney+ offerings. Earlier this year, Michael Waldron was enlisted to pen the upcoming <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/loki"><b>Loki</b></a> series starring Tom Hiddleston.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy Slater is going to handle <b>Moon Knight</b>. Slater isn’t a stranger to the comic book world. Most recently, he developed Netflix’s <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-umbrella-academy">The Umbrella Academy</a></b>, based on Gerard Way and Gabriel Bá’s comic of the same name. Slater also co-wrote the scripts for the 2015 <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/fantastic-four"><b>Fantastic Four</b></a> reboot and Netflix’s <b>Death Note</b> adaptation.</p>
      <p>Previously, Marvel hired Bisha K. Ali to write the <b>Ms. Marvel</b> series. All three of these new shows are confirmed to be part of Phase Four of the MCU. But unfortunately, no release dates have been set yet.</p>
