      <p>MADRID, Nov 9 — Basque outfit Real Sociedad went top of Spain’s La Liga yesterday thanks to a 1-1 draw at home against bottom side Leganes.</p>
      <p>In a season which has seen several sides go top, including Granada, Real Sociedad have 23 points from 13 games with Barcelona and Real Madrid just a point behind with two games in hand and both playing today.</p>
      <p>Leganes striker Mikel Merino got the away side off the mark in the 63rd minute before before Moroccan Youssef En-Nesyri equalised with a header on 78.</p>
      <p>“I see long faces both inside the dressing room and out of it, but we have to be happy,” said Real Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil.</p>
      <p>His opposite number Javier Aguirre overseeing his first point in his first match in charge was also positive.</p>
      <p>“We’re still bottom and that’s how it goes sometimes but we have got a point at a difficult ground against a strong side who are top of the league and I’m really happy for the boys,” said Aguirre.</p>
      <p>Leganes have just six points and will be locked in a long struggle to climb out of the relegation zone. — AFP</p>
