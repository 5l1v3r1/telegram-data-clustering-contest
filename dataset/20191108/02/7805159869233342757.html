      <p>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Tech Summit is an annual event during which the chipmaker unveils its upcoming offerings. At last year’s event, Qualcomm <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-855-snapdragon-elite-gaming-3d-sonic-sensor/">unveiled its flagship Snapdragon 855</a> mobile platform for 2019. It also unveiled the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-summit-2018-5g-news/">Snapdragon X50 modem</a>, along with the QTM052 mmWave antenna module, that can be found on most 5G enabled smartphones today. Along with that, the company <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-spectra-380-isp-integrated-ai/">launched the Qualcomm Spectra 380</a> — the world’s first image signal processor (ISP) with integrated artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Qualcomm also <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8cx-always-on-always-connected-pc/">showcased the Snapdragon 8cx compute platform</a>, to power a new generation of premium Always on, Always Connected PCs. The new chip featured 4×4 Kryo 495 CPU cores with a larger system and L3 cache that allowed for faster multitasking. On the graphics front, the chip included the new Adreno 680 GPU, promising double the performance and 60% greater power efficiency compared to the Snapdragon 850. It is the most powerful platform to come out of Qualcomm’s stables.</p>
      <p>Now, the company has officially announced the dates for the Snapdragon Tech Summit 2019 and we expect to see some impressive new hardware at the event. The event is scheduled to start on December 3rd in Maui, Hawaii. At the event, the company is expected to announce the new Snapdragon 8xx series chip (most likely the Snapdragon 865) for the mobile platform. As with last year’s event, we also believe that Qualcomm will showcase ISP advancements, along with an upgraded 5G modem. While Snapdragon 8cx powered laptops are <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2019/09/19/snapdragon-8cx-ushers-new-era-computing-starting-samsung-galaxy-book-s">just starting to hit the market</a>, the company may also announce some improvements to the platform at this year’s event.</p>
      <p>Much like last year, we here at XDA will be attending the event to cover all the latest news we thing you should know about. Make sure you stay tuned to our coverage to catch all the latest announcements at the Qualcomm Snapdragon Tech Summit 2019.</p>
