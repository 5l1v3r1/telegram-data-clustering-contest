      <p>Prince William caught up with a surprise celebrity pal tonight at a glittering charity bash where he admitted he spends a lot of his free time sleeping.</p>
      <p>The busy dad-of-three, 37, appeared delighted when he spotted rock legend Eric Clapton among the guests at a star-studded gala dinner, honouring a 30th anniversary fundraising campaign for London’s Air Ambulance Charity.</p>
      <p>The event at Rosewood London, a luxury hotel in the capital, was hosted by television presenter Natalie Pinkham.</p>
      <p>Guests included former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone and his wife Fabiana, Bernie’s daughter Tamara and her husband, art gallery owner Jay Rutland.</p>

      <p>And the second in line to the throne and Clapton, 74, appeared to be old friends.</p>
      <p>“Hi Eric,” William said.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a while,” Clapton replied.</p>
      <p>They talked about a mutual interest, which may have been their love for the Caribbean island of Mustique.</p>

      <p>“I was there the other day,” Clapton said.</p>
      <p>William told him that looking after his children meant he had less free time to pursue hobbies.</p>
      <p>“Any free time I get, I sleep,” the future King said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Duke met air ambulance doctors, paramedics, and pilots attending the black tie dinner reception in their orange uniforms.</p>
      <p>William, a former air ambulance pilot, is patron of the charity’s 30 Years Saving Lives campaign, which aims to highlight its vital work delivering lifesaving treatment across London and raise funds for new facilities.</p>

      <p>It has already raised almost £2million.</p>
      <p>Drawing on his own experience he said: “ What struck me when I worked with East Anglia and through my support for London’s Air Ambulance this year is that serious injury can happen indiscriminately.</p>
      <p>"To anyone. At any time. In any place. That moment that turns lives upside down.</p>
      <p>"Whatever the injury or the circumstance – if a person falls from a great height, is involved in a road traffic collision, or is stabbed – they need the hospital to come to them immediately.</p>

      <p>"That’s what makes a difference. And that’s what saves lives.”</p>
      <p>The air ambulance, which has treated more than 40,000 patients and has attended most major incidents in the capital including 7/7, the London Bridge attacks, and the Croydon tram crash, operates around the clock 365 days a year, serving the city’s 10 million population.</p>
      <p>It costs around £10 million each year to deliver the service.</p>
      <p> Jonathan Jenkins, chief executive of London’s Air Ambulance, hailed William as “one of our own” and thanked wealthy donors at the fundraising dinner.</p>
      <p>He said: “Your efforts tonight will help us save lives today, tonight and going forward. It’s as simple as that.”</p>
