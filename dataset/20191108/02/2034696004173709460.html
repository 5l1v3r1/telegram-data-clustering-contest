        <b>A trailer arrives on Monday</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first stills of <i>Scoob!</i>, Warner Bros’ upcoming animated movie in the <i>Scooby-Doo</i> franchise, have been released, ahead of a trailer arriving Monday (November 11). See them below.</p>
      <p><i>Scoob!</i> – directed by Tony Cervone – has been in development since 2013, and will be the first movie in the Hannah-Barbera franchise since the live-action movies, 2002’s <i>Scooby-Doo</i> and its 2004 sequel <i>Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed</i>.</p>
      <p>The first stills from the movie were published by <a href="https://www.fandango.com/movie-news/exclusive-see-scoob-images-now-753955">Fandango</a> yesterday (November 7). See them below.</p>

      <p>The plot of the new <i>Scooby-Doo</i> movie will reportedly focus on how the gang of teenage detectives and their lovable Great Dane – namely, Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby – met and came to form Mystery Inc.</p>

      <p>According to <i>Fandango</i>, the Mystery Inc. crew “must foil a diabolical plot revolving around a ghost dog known as Cerberus, discovering Scooby’s secret legacy and their own epic destiny along the way”.</p>
