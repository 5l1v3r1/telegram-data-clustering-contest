      <h1>Chiefs dismiss Steve Hansen's criticism of Warren Gatland's Lions sabbatical</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> have rebuffed Steve Hansen’s critique of the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> contract that will allow new coach Warren Gatland to take a season off to coach the British and Irish Lions.</p>
      <p>Departing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> coach Hansen caused a stir at the conclusion of the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> last week when he questioned the nature of Gatland’s four-year deal with the Kiwi outfit.</p>
      <p>Long-serving <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> mentor Gatland will coach the Chiefs from 2020 to 2023 but take 2021 off to lead the British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> on their tour of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> that year.</p>

      <p>Hansen, who is known to have an icy relationship with Gatland, wondered why the Chiefs would agree to a deal that could be disruptive.</p>
      <p>“Having him back in New Zealand, not sure how that is going to work to be honest,” Hansen said.</p>
      <p>“Because he is going to go and do the Lions after that.</p>
      <p>“So there is not going to be a lot of continuity there for the Chiefs and him.</p>
      <p>“But I am sure he will work his way through that.”</p>

      <p>Chiefs chief executive <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/blues/players/michael-collins/">Michael Collins</a> reiterated the stance adopted when Gatland was appointed in June, believing the 2021 “sabbatical” could be catered for without disruption.</p>
      <p>“I’m really comfortable with where we’re at. We’ve got some great assistant coaches, we’ve got some good continuity going forward,” Collins said.</p>
      <p>“People will have their own opinions on that, as Steve Hansen has, but I’ve got a good crew set up and I’m not as concerned.”</p>
      <p>Collins said Gatland had his heart set on leading the Lions for a third tour but had otherwise been engaged with Chiefs management since his appointment.</p>

      <p>An interim head coach for 2021 is yet to be finalised but Collins said planning was “well advanced” and whether it would be someone from the six-strong assistant coaching staff that was unveiled on Friday.</p>
      <p>Five of them are familiar to Chiefs supporters, having served as assistants previously.</p>
      <p>Neil Barnes (forwards), Tabai Matson (defence), Roger Randle (attack), Nick White (scrum) and Andrew Strawbridge (resource coach) will be joined by former Chiefs five-eighth David Hill.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Gatland had been in Hamilton this week working with the Chiefs but was to return to the UK before taking charge fully from December 3.</p>
