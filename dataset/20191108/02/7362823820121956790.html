      <p>There’s nothing like a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting">mother</a>’s rage.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/viral">video </a>of an angry mom confronting her son’s alleged <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/education/bullying">bully</a>, in which she threatens to “rip” the child’s “face off,” has gone viral.</p>
      <p>The video, posted on Twitter by the blog London Streets, shows an irate woman confronting a boy who she accuses of touching her son.</p>
      <p>The furious mom gets up close and personal with the apparent bully, who is filming her, and begins “daring” the unidentified person to touch her son again.</p>

      <p>The alleged bully is heard telling the woman “you can’t touch me, you ain’t allowed to touch me.”</p>
      <p>At one point, the woman is seen stepping away from the child but returns after taking off her hat and putting her hair in a ponytail.</p>
      <p>“I ain't from around here, you know who I am? I'm [child's] mom, I'm [child's] mom, yeah. No, I ain't gonna stop getting close,” the woman yells.</p>

      <p>“Good on her! Kid knows his rights too much ‘you’re not allowed to touch me’ yet doesn’t know how to behave towards others,” another Twitter user wrote.</p>

      <p>Some comments suggested that, while the mother's reaction was understandable, she should have taken a less aggressive approach.</p>
      <p>“Probably better to find out where the kid lives and go back and have an adult discussion about what’s been happening,” read one comment. “I’m sure the bully’s parents would be ashamed and would be angry with their son. Could even end with a long term friendship between bully and bullied.”</p>
