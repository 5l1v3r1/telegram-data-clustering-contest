      <p>HSBC has been told by the Bank of England to tighten up compliance controls for fraud, staff conduct and other non-financial risks, a source close to the bank said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>LONDON: HSBC has been told by the Bank of England to tighten up compliance controls for fraud, staff conduct and other non-financial risks, a source close to the bank said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Prudential Regulation Authority regulators had highlighted the weaknesses and HSBC executives will discuss ways to address them at a forthcoming meeting, the source told Reuters, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg.</p>

      <p>Samir Assaf, HSBC's global banking and markets division head, told senior bankers on a conference call on Tuesday of the issue, said the source, adding the weaknesses had been identified during routine regulatory work.</p>
      <p>HSBC has been dogged by compliance problems, with the most high profile scandal involving helping Mexican drug cartels launder money, leading to a US$1.9 billion U.S. settlement in 2012.</p>
      <p>A Department of Justice deferred prosecution agreement ended five years later, after HSBC invested hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance measures.</p>
      <p>The PRA compliance issue adds to HSBC interim chief executive Noel Quinn's workload as he begins a costly overhaul to address sluggish European and U.S. performances.</p>
