      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - The White House is objecting to a forthcoming book by an anonymous author who describes President Donald Trump as volatile, incompetent and unfit to be commander in chief.</p>
      <p>The Washington Post acquired a copy of the book, called "A Warning," and first reported on its contents Thursday.</p>
      <p>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham says, "The coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies."</p>
      <p>She says reporters should "cover the book as what it is - a work of fiction."</p>
      <p>The author is identified only as "a senior official in the Trump administration."</p>
      <p>According to the Post, the book describes racist and misogynist behind-the-scenes statements by Trump and says he "stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information."</p>
