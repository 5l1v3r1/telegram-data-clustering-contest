      <h1>Woman, 89, who survived Holocaust needs police protection over far-right threats</h1>
      <h2>Liliana Segre, 89, was sent to Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944 when she was 13 and was one of the few children her age to return to Italy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T02:39:50+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 02:39</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Crispian Balmer, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Holocaust survivor Liliana Segre has been placed under police protection after being bombarded by far-right threats.</p>
      <p>Mrs Segre, 89, from Italy, called for Parliamentary action into investigate the rise of racism and anti-Semitism in Italy after receiving daily abuse on social media.</p>
      <p>The attacks intensified after Italy's right-wing parties refused to back her proposal for a commission to look into the issue.</p>
      <p>A neo-Nazi group appeared to target one of her recent public appearances by hanging a banner denouncing anti-fascism nearby.</p>
      <p>A security source said police were only accompanying her to public events and not providing round-the-clock protection.</p>

      <p>"It must be said that Liliana receives vastly more messages of support and solidarity than she does hate messages," said Paola Gargiulo, Mrs Segre's chief of staff.</p>
      <p>Mrs Segre was deported from Italy to Auschwitz in 1944 when she was 13 - one of 776 Italian children under the age of 14 who were sent to the Nazi concentration camp. Only 25 survived.</p>
      <p>She has dedicated much of her time in recent years to visiting schools to recount the horrors of the Holocaust and was named a life Senator in 2018.</p>
      <p>Israel's ambassador to Italy, Dror Eydar, expressed dismay at the news Mrs Segre needed a police escort.</p>
      <p>"An 89-year-old Holocaust survivor under guard symbolises the danger that Jewish communities still face in Europe today," he wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>

      <p>Government ministers also expressed solidarity. "Forgive us Liliana. The politics of hate will not stop your commitment, nor ours," said Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova on Twitter.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from the leaders of the main rightist parties, the League and Brothers of Italy, who had opposed Mrs Segre's call for a parliamentary commission, warning that it could lead to censorship.</p>
      <p>The Centre of Contemporary Jewish Documentation (CDEC), said anti-Semitism appeared to be increasing in Italy, but was still much less pronounced than in France and Britain.</p>
      <p>CDEC researcher Stefano Gatti said that until the beginning of November 190 cases of anti-Semitism had been reported in Italy against 197 in all of 2018 and 130 in 2017.</p>
      <p>Most were social media attacks and verbal insults, with just two acts of minor violence registered this year.</p>
      <p>"The anti-Semitism we are seeing is getting more aggressive, but the number of anti-Semites in Italy is largely stable," said Gatti, pointing to surveys that suggested around 11 percent of Italians were hostile to, or prejudiced against Jews.</p>
