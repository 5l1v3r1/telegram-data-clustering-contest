      <h1>Back in 2015, a Russian-Built Submarine Claims to Have Sunk a U.S. Navy Sub</h1>

      <p><b>Key Point:</b> If true, it shows that India's undersea forces are improving.</p>
      <p>Several years ago the Indian submarine INS <i>Sindhudhvaj</i> (S56) allegedly “killed” USS <i>City of Corpus Christi</i> (SSN 705) during an exercise called Malabar that is held annually between India, Japan and the United States. According to the Indians, the submarines were assigned to track each other down in the Bay of Bengal. “The way it happens is that the <i>Sindhudhva</i>j recorded the Hydrophonic Effect (HE) - simply put, underwater noise - of the nuclear-powered submarine and managed to positively identify it before locking on to it. Being an exercise what did not happen was the firing,” an Indian naval officer<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/in-underwater-battle-india-annihilates-american-n-submarine/1/533506.html"> <u>told </u><u><i>India Today</i>.</u></a> The Indian vessel then “sank” USS <i>City of Corpus Christi</i> using 533mm torpedoes.</p>
      <p>If the Indian description of the events is correct, it would be a bright spot in an otherwise dismal record for New Delhi’s undersea force. In recent years, the woefully neglected Indian submarine fleet has suffered numerous calamities. Submarines have run aground, caught fire and even sunk due to a combination of underinvestment, negligence and corruption.  Perhaps the worst incident was when INS <i>Sindhurakshak </i>sank when at harbor in Mumbai after a series of explosions in the forward torpedo bay, killing eighteen sailors.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it’s not a huge surprise that a<a href="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/kilo/"> <u>Russian-built </u><u>Kilo</u></a> would be able to defeat a <i>Los Angeles</i>-class attack boat. The<a href="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/la/"> <u>Los Angeles</u></a>-class is a dated design that is slowly being replaced by the newer and exponentially quieter <i>Virginia</i>-class submarine. However, it must be noted that we do not know the rules of engagement or parameters that the sides had agreed to. Furthermore, it must be noted there is the possibility of exaggeration.</p>
