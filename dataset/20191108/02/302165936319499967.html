      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 8 — Police have opened a murder investigation on the death of seven-year-old boy found with bruises at an unregistered tahfiz school in Lanchang, Temerloh yesterday.</p>
      <p>According to national news agency Bernama, Pahang CID chief Datuk Othman Nanyan said the boy died around 1pm yesterday while being treated at the Lanchang Health Clinic.</p>
      <p>“According to preliminary investigations, a female warden found the student in a weak state and brought him to the health clinic.</p>
      <p>“The victim is understood to have joined the tahfiz centre in October, with his stepbrother,” Othman was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>The state CID chief said three 13-year-olds have been arrested for investigations.</p>
      <p>The husband-and-wife owners of the tahfiz centre opened the unregistered facility earlier this year and had four students, including the dead boy.</p>
      <p>In 2017, a fire broke out at Pusat Tahfiz Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah in Kuala Lumpur, causing the death of 23 people.</p>
      <p>The incident drew public and regulatory attention on unregistered tahfiz centres operating throughout the country.</p>
