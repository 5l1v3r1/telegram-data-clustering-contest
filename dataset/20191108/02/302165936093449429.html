      <p><i>Pokémon Go</i> players now have a new quest that culminates in a confrontation with Giovanni, leader of Team Go Rocket and the <i>Pokémon</i> franchise’s original antagonist group, Team Rocket.</p>
      <p>The mission makes use of a Special Research tab found within the <i>Pokémon Go</i> iOS and Android app, through which players can opt in to a Special Research task.</p>
      <p>The alternative adventure has them then retrieve six Mysterious Component pieces of a Rocket Radar from Team Rocket Grunts they encounter in the wild.</p>
      <p>Assembled radar equipment then allows them to track down the three virtual Team Go Rocket Leaders hidden around real world locations that double as <i>Pokémon Go</i> PokéStops.</p>
      <p>While the reveal of Team Go Rocket Leader hideouts is limited to players who have a completed Rocket Radar, other players can then detect uncovered Rocket Leader hideouts after initial discovery, the official Pokémon Go blog confirmed.</p>
      <p>Defeating these Team Go Rocket Leaders allows players to rescue a Shadow Pokémon with special qualities; they are then well on the way to tracking down team boss Giovanni, who has captured a Legendary Shadow Pokémon.</p>
      <p>Team Go Rocket was introduced to Niantic’s officially licenced <i>Pokémon Go</i> in July 2019, and its presence has expanded in the time since.</p>
      <p>This latest Giovanni event begins a week before the release of <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Pokémon Shield</i> on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released <i>Pokémon Let’s Go, Pikachu!</i> and <i>Pokémon Let’s Go, Eevee!</i> for the Nintendo Switch, remakes of one of the first ever <i>Pokémon</i> games designed in part to ease transition into the mainline series for those whose familiarity with the franchise came through mobile spin-off <i>Pokémon Go</i>. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
