      <p>ALLERTON, Bronx (WABC) -- Police are searching for the gunman who hurt two men inside a Bronx juice bar, an incident in which one man was shot and the other pistol-whipped.</p>
      <p>It happened inside the Heath Juice Bar on Adee Avenue in the Allerton section around 10:30 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Police say a man walked into the store and shot the 30-year-old worker in the chest.</p>
      <p>A bystander, who happened to enter at the time of the shooting, apparently recognized the man and confronted him.</p>
      <p>They got in a fight, and the bystander was pistol-whipped but was eventually able to take control of the suspect's gun as he ran from the store.</p>
      <p>The bystander then turned the gun over to the police.</p>
      <p>The store worker is listed in critical but stable condition at Jacobi Medical Center.</p>
      <p>The man who was pistol-whipped was treated for minor injuries.</p>
