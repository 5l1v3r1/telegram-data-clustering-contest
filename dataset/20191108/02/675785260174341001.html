      <h1>Brad Pitt 'disheartened' that Angelina Jolie blames him for 'blocking move abroad'</h1>
      <h2>Angelina Jolie said in a recent interview that Brad Pitt was 'blocking' their kids from moving abroad but he is not happy at being labelled 'the bad guy'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T02:32:08+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 02:32</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Brad Pitt is not happy at being painted as 'the bad guy' in 'blocking' his children's move abroad with ex <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/angelina-jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> .</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old Maleficent star had indicated in an interview with Harper's Bazaar that their six children are having to stay "where their father chooses to live."</p>
      <p>This has reportedly infuriated the 55-year-old Hollywood legend, who is thought to be 'disheartened' by Angelina's comment about Maddox, 18, Pax, 15, Zahara, 14, Shiloh, 13, and 11-year-old twins, Knox and Vivienne.</p>
      <p>Angelina had bemoaned that she would have to wait until the children were 18 before they could decide to relocate but Brad is thought to be annoyed as to why she made such a comment.</p>

      <p>A source has told <a href="http://www.hollywoodlife.com/">Hollywood Life</a> : "Brad is disappointed, he finds it pretty disheartening that she would make that sort of comment and try to paint him as the bad guy, especially since he’s been so flexible and understanding when it comes to her travel schedule with the kids."</p>
      <p>It is believed that Brad will not be making a public response to the comment though as he does not see how it would make the situation any better.</p>
      <p>The source continued: "But he won’t retaliate and he won’t respond, he does not feel that it’s in his kids’ best interest to share details about the custody arrangement so he will remain tight-lipped as always."</p>

      <p>It had been previously reported that Brad and Angelina had come to an agreement on the custody arrangement for their children.</p>
      <p>A new source has suggested that this is now "complicated" with Angelina's comments not going down well.</p>
      <p>The source told Hollywood Life: "They have a complicated arrangement at present, but she has primary custody with Brad getting tons of visitation as instructed by a judge the last time they went to court."</p>

      <p>Angelina is reportedly hesitant to grant Brad joint custody in the future, with a source saying: "She has no issues with Brad spending time with the kids and she is being sure to follow all visitation guidelines set down by the courts, but she doesn’t want to give up primary custody.</p>
      <p>"Of course, if the law requires her to give Brad joint custody she will comply, that’s a given, but it will be very hard on her because the kids are her world.”</p>
