      <h1>Karl Urban Says The Boys Season 2 Will Hit Amazon In Mid-2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T02:40:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 02:40</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year, Garth Ennis and Derrick Robertson’s cult comic, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-boys"><b>The Boys</b></a>, became one of Amazon’s biggest hits. The series was renewed for season 2 even before the first season premiered. That foresight allowed the second season to begin production early. Now, series star Karl Urban has revealed that <b>The Boys</b> will be back in 2020.</p>
      <p>Via his Instagram account, Urban shared a post to celebrate the wrap of <b>The Boys</b>‘ second season.</p>

      <p>Urban plays Billy Butcher, the leader of “the Boys,” a group that also includes new recruit, Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid). Additionally, Laz Alonso co-stars as Marvin/Mother’s Milk, Tomer Capon as Frenchie, and Karen Fukuhara as Kimiko/the Female. Their adversaries are the Seven, a Justice League-like team of “heroes” led by Homelander (Antony Starr) whose immense power and ruthless streak make him incredibly dangerous.</p>
