      <p>CAPE TOWN: Two of South Africa’s World Cup winners face significant spells on the sidelines after injuries sustained in Saturday’s 32-12 final victory over England in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>Flyhalf Handre Pollard, who stayed on the field for the whole match against England, has had surgery on a fractured eye socket and will be ruled out for six weeks, delaying his move to French Top 14 side Montpellier, South African Rugby said on Thursday.</p>

      <p>De Jager, 26, was set to join English side Sale Sharks after the World Cup, but his move to the Premiership will be delayed until next year.</p>
