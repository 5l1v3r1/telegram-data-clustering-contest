      <p>BERLIN (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is stressing the need for allied democracies to work together, saying that the Trump administration’s stances on NATO spending, Iran, Chinese technology and a new Russian-German pipeline are meant to defend hard-won freedoms.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Berlin Friday during a visit marking the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Pompeo said that, 30 years later, authoritarianism is once again rising.</p>
      <p>Citing Russia’s actions in Ukraine and China’s crackdown on dissidents, he says “we must recognize that free nations are in a competition of values with unfree nations.”</p>
      <p>He says that’s why the U.S. has opposed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, raised pressure on Iran, warned of Chinese 5G network developments and urged NATO countries to increase spending.</p>
      <p>He says: “If we don’t lead, who will?”</p>
