      <h3>A 50 per cent share in Westfield Marion shopping centre has been sold for $670 million, making it the “largest single asset retail transaction” in Australia this year.</h3>
      <p>According to The Advertiser:</p>
      <blockquote>The purchase of the 50 per cent share of the Westfield Marion shopping centre by a Singapore investment house SPT REIT, in conjunction with ASX-listed financial services group Moelis Australia, marks the largest retail transaction ever recorded in SA and is one of the largest globally for 2019.<br/><br/>Scentre Group will retain ownership of the remaining 50 per cent stake after the sale, which was announced to the Singapore Stock exchange late Thursday night after the Lendlease-managed Australian Prime Property Fund Retail sold its half share which it has owned since 2003…<br/><br/>Westfield Marion is the eleventh-largest shopping centre in Australia and has a floorplate of almost 137,000 sqm which brings in around $839 million in annual retail sales from its stores, which include David Jones and Myer together with 310 specialty stores, a fresh food precinct and a cinema.</blockquote>
