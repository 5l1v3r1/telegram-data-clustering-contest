      <p><b>Original Article:</b> Out of nowhere, Nintendo has released a brand new game on the Switch eShop in Japan. It's called <b>The Stretchers</b> and is a two-player game where you must drive around and rescue people.</p>
      <p>The gameplay is broken up into two components and looks like a combination of Sega's <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/crazy_taxi">Crazy Taxi</a></b> series and the upcoming release <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/moving_out">Moving Out</a></b>. The game requires a single Joy-Con per person, meaning friends and family can easily join in.</p>
      <p>Here's a <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/JP/ja/titles/70010000008110">Nintendo website</a> translation, courtesy of <a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/11/nintendo-releases-co-op-action-game-the-stretchers-for-switch-in-japan">Gematsu</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>A two-person rescue team must stay in sync to save the islanders!</blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>The Strechers</i> is set on Green Horn Island, where people spent each day in peace until the self-proclaimed genius Captain Blaine suddenly appeared and hypnotized the islanders to become lightheaded, sending the island into major panic!</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Players take on the role of a two-person rescue team called “The Stretchers,” and must respond to rescue calls from around the island to rescue the lightheaded islanders.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>The game can be played with one Joy-Con, allowing family and friends to play together via two-player co-op. Additionally, a single player can control both of the rescue team members.</blockquote>

      <p>The Stretchers will set you back 2,000 yen and the Japanese version includes English language support. We'll be sure to let you know if this game gets a local release in North America and Europe.</p>
