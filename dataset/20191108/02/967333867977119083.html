      <p>Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the Post claimed in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-wanted-barr-to-hold-news-conference-saying-the-president-broke-no-laws-in-call-with-ukrainian-leader/2019/11/06/16d541ec-ff55-11e9-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html">Wednesday article</a> that Trump requested Barr, the head of the US Department of Justice, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911071077249890-trump-cnn-wapo-fake-news-barr-ukraine/">back him up</a> amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry concerning his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to the paper’s sources, Barr refused to do so.</p>

      <p>Aside from Trump’s <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1192438178747170816?s=20">series of tweets</a> proclaiming his innocence, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley also issued a statement slamming the “shady” Post article: “The President has nothing but respect for AG Barr and greatly appreciates the work he’s done on behalf of the country – and no amount of shady sources with clear intent to divide, smear, and slander will change that.”</p>
