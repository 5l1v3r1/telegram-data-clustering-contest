      <p>BERLIN -- An explosion at a mine in eastern Germany on Friday injured two people, and some 35 had to be rescued from safe areas hundreds of metres underground.</p>
      <p>The explosion happened Friday morning at the Teutschenthal facility, near Halle. It apparently was caused by an explosive mixture of gases.</p>
      <p>Around 35 people were some 700 metres (2,300 feet) underground after the explosion, in secure areas and supplied with oxygen, the state mining authority in Saxony-Anhalt said.</p>
      <p>Police said in a tweet late Friday morning that everyone had been rescued.</p>
      <p>The facility was a potash mine until 1982. Mineral waste is now stored there. About 100 people work at the facility.</p>
