      <p>Death Stranding is the first game produced by Kojima Productions with ex-Metal Gear Solid director, Hideo Kojima, and it’s as weird and fascinating as the name suggests. It's one of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/game/26-most-anticipated-games-of-2016-june-3625293/">most anticipated new games of the year</a> and features celebrity appearances from the likes of Norman Redus, Mads Mikkelsen and more.  </p>
      <p>Following years of weird and wonderful teasers, in May 2019 Kojima Productions dropped the first of a series of trailers giving us a more in-depth look at the story, and more importantly, a release date.</p>
      <p>At Gamescom 2019 in August, the first extended gameplay trailer debuted (<a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/game/death-stranding-3641995/#Latest">click here to skip ahead to it</a>) alongside two character posters. Less than a month later at the Tokyo Game Show, Kojima then showcased a full 49 minutes of continuous gameplay, granting a fresh and far more in-depth look at the gameplay, visuals and the feel the game aims to strike.</p>
      <p>Read on to find out everything else you need to know about Death Stranding ahead of the long-awaited release later this week.</p>

      <h3>When is Death Stranding coming out in the UK?</h3>
      <h4>Death Stranding UK release date: 8 November 2019</h4>
      <p>Of course, the biggest question right now is “When is Death Stranding coming out?” and while a 2019 release date was rumoured for some time, the exact date wasn't confirmed until mid-2019. Death Stranding is set to be released on PS4 on <b>8 November 2019</b>. </p>

      <h3>Will Death Standing be available on PC?</h3>
      <p>Despite being billed from day one as a PlayStation exclusive, it's since been confirmed that Death Stranding will also come to PC - but not until <b>summer 2020</b>, so there'll be a while yet to wait.</p>
      <h3>What can we expect from Death Stranding?</h3>

      <p>We were treated to a rather cryptic announcement trailer (shown above) during <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/game/sony-e3-2016-press-conference-live-video-stream-death-stranding-3615431/">Sony’s E3 2016 press conference</a> featuring The Walking Dead’s Norman Reedus, a disappearing baby and a fairly bleak, almost post-apocalyptic setting, but not much else.</p>

      <p>Another trailer (above) aired during the Game Awards in December of 2016, and revealed that Mads Mikkelsen will also star. This came alongside the release of two new posters:</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Hideo Kojima then sat down with Digital Spy and shed some light on the game, and the behind-the-scenes action. "It will be an action game if you really want to put a genre on it" Kojima explained, but it won’t be your typical action game – coming from the man behind Metal Gear Solid, we’re not surprised.</p>
      <p>"For example, when I made Metal Gear, it was an action game but it was different because the main thing was about hiding. People eventually ended up calling that 'stealth action'. In this game, the player will be controlling Norman but by playing it they will find something different, something that won't fit in established terms."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Game Awards 2017 brought with them the third trailer (below) for the game, but it was no less cryptic than the two that came before it. Reedus' character is seen serving as part of a team that gets attacked by... something <i>or some things</i>.</p>
      <p>There's a lot of talk about explosions, some invisible monsters, a giant, gravity getting reversed and a fetus giving a thumbs up.</p>

      <p>We got our first glimpse of actual gameplay at E3 2018, though the premise of the game still seemed as confusing as ever. We were also introduced to new celebrity characters and given a quick look at the stunning and varied open world that the game is set in. We saw Sam, the main character, roaming the unnaturally empty, open world through rivers, thick grass, up mountains and on beaches, carrying a varied amount of equipment (that, in true Kojima fashion, wasn't explained). </p>
      <p>It sounds weird but it oddly makes a little bit more sense when you watch the eight-minute trailer. You can see that below:</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><anchor name="tgs2018"/>Then, in September 2018, Kojima took to the stage during PlayStation's TGS 2018 presentation to reveal a new, shorter trailer. It introduced a mysterious-looking character that can control the black goo, voiced by Troy Baker. We'll leave the clip's biggest surprise for you to witness yourself in the below trailer:</p>

      </figure>
      <p><anchor name="Latest"/>At Gamescom 2019, just mere months away from the game's release date, we saw our first extended look at the gameplay of Death Stranding. Skip to 13:55 to see it within the presentation below:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNd20wzcBL0" width="720" height="405" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Within the presentation, we also saw a trailer that gives us a closer look at the character, Mama (voiced by Margaret Qualley and based on her likeness), as well as a second trailer that explains the concept of the 'Bridge Baby' for the first time. Skip to 3:50 and 8:00 respectively for those.</p>
      <p>Finally, the launch trailer came just a week before the game's release and gives more cryptic hints at the weird and hopefully wonderful story:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_bd0kIUZRU" width="720" height="405" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>But what about the name of the game? Kojima offered a bit of an explanation for that, too. "A strand in psychology is often used to refer to ties or chains," he explained. "So how all the crabs [in the trailer] have this weird umbilical cord and how the baby is tied to Norman [Reedus' character] is a representation of this."</p>
      <p>In reference to the Gamescom trailer and what the game is about Kojima told <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3641995-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fgame%2Fdeath-stranding-3641995%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2F2016%2F06%2Fhideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview%2F">Wired</a>:</p>
      <p>"You can see the crabs, the whales, all things, they all have these umbilical cables. Norman, as he stands up. It's a very important part, this connection. That's the keyword. What people are playing today in open-world action games, or linear action games, it will compare naturally to them. It will feel familiar."</p>
      <p>"But after an hour or two of playing, you will start to feel something different, something new that you haven't played. The story is about connections, what you call "strands" in psychology - how people are connected."</p>
      <p>He also added that you see a lot of games with items relating to the stick, the first tool humanity invented, such as guns and the like. However, in Death Stranding, it will be more about rope.</p>
      <p>"There will be the equivalent of sticks. But also, I want to tie people together with the equivalent of ropes," explains Kojima.</p>
      <p>Kojima went back to that stick and rope analogy in an<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3641995-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fgame%2Fdeath-stranding-3641995%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fglixel%2Ffeatures%2Fkojima-death-stranding-aims-to-be-a-new-sort-of-game-of-war-w499148"> interview</a> with Glixel. "Games are still primarily players with sticks fighting each other," he said. "They cannot break the curse of using sticks to keep evil away, or defeating enemies. I want to change this."</p>
      <p>"It's time for humankind to take the rope in hand. We are ready for a game not based on competition, but on the rope that will bring good to the player and make connections. We don't need a game about dividing players between winners and losers, but about creating connections at a different level. My current project, Death Stranding, aims to fulfil this goal."</p>
      <p>So, yeah. That doesn't really clear much up.</p>
      <p>What is likely our last look at the game before it launches in early November came out of the Tokyo Game Show 2019, where Kojima showcased a whopping 49 minutes of near-continuous gameplay to give us greater insight into what players will actually be doing within the world of Death Stranding.</p>
      <p>Based on the footage (below), resource management is clearly part of the equation. Players will need to balance how many containers filled with resources they can strap to Sam's body against the effects the additional weight will have on his speed and how easy it will be to traverse the game world.</p>
      <p>We're shown what combat against human NPCs looks like, as well as against at least one of the beings that lurks within the tainted world that we'd glimpsed in previous trailers for the game.</p>

      <p>Whatever Death Stranding is, we’re really excited about the future of this game, and we’ll be keeping our eyes open for more gameplay details as they appear.</p>
