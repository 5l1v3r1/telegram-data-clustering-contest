      <h1>Ken says Rita is easy to be with</h1>

      <h3>KEN Chan is visible on TV every day of the week, Mondays to Fridays in “One of the Baes” and on Saturdays and Sunday as a host in “The Clash Season 2”. He is paired with Rita Daniela in both shows and fans of their RitKen love team are now wondering if something romantic has already developed between them. They seem to be so at home with each and no longer have any inhibitions of any sort.</h3>
      <p>“We’ve really become very close since we did ‘My Special Tatay’ kunsaan nakilala 'yung BoBrey tandem namin as Boyet and Aubrey,” says Ken when we talked to him on the set of “The Clash”. “Magkatugma ang mga ugali namin at madali siyang pakisamahan. Napakagaling din niyang umarte at siya 'yung tipo ng artista na walang reklamo kahit anong ipagawa sa kanya, tulad po ng role niya sa ‘One of the Baes’ as Jowa Biglangdapa. She doesn’t mind making fun of herself with Kuya Roderick Paulate and we also can see kung paano siya pahirapan ni Joyce Ching at ni Ms. Melanie Marquez sa mga eksena nila, but she has no complaints at all. We’re really very thankful that viewers like our romcom at lumalaban talaga siya sa ratings gabi-gabi.”</p>
      <p>And how is it to be a host of “The Clash Season 2”?</p>
      <p>“I’m really thankful to be part of this talent search kasi, as journey hosts, duty namin ni Rita na kilalanin ang bawat isang Clasher at i-present sa audience ang back stories nila. Siempre, as we get to know them better at hindi naming maiwasang hindi kami maapektuhan ng personal stories. Lahat sila, may kanya-kanyang pinagdaraanan  kung bakit sila sumali sa singing contest at nais nilang manalo. The Clashers are all good at narito kami to give them moral support and to assure them that they can do it. We are here purposely to motivate them for them not to hold back but to always give their best. They should overcome being nervous na na-experience ko rin noong araw backstage. The most important thing is that they have to believe in themselves and their own talent.”</p>
      <p>Ken is happy that Clasher Sassa Dagdag gave a show stopping performance that has now registered 500,000 hits on youtube. Sassa’s heartfelt rendition of the Elvis Presley classic “Can’t Help Falling in Love” in the “Matira Matibay” round is really amazing, as one netizen wrote: “The emotions are there, techniques are there, originality is there. Wow Sassa that's why I've always waited for you to perform.” Will Sassa excel again in this weekend’s “The Clash”. Don’t miss the show tonight and tomorrow night.</p>
