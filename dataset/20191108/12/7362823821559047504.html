      <h1>Tucker's challenge to 2020 Democrats: Plant a tree for every mile of private jet travel</h1>

      <p>Tucker Carlson has a challenge for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 Democratic presidential candidates</a> who are pushing new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment">'Green' plans</a>: "plant a tree for every mile that you fly private."</p>
      <p>"It's not hard and if you care, you will," he said on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Tucker Carlson Tonight"</a> Thursday.</p>
      <p>"They're very concerned, but not so concerned that they won't stop flying private," he remarked.</p>
      <p>Each of the three Democratic frontrunners -- <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">former Vice President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.</a>, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders">Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.</a> -- have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cei-dem-debate-green-new-deal">all endorsed</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's</a>, D-N.Y., <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/green-new-deal">Green New Deal</a> framework. Their plans ranged from $1.7 trillion over 10 years to $16 trillion over 15 years.</p>

      <p>Carlson said it's not a request, but a "demand," for candidates who suggest "the world is going to end in 12 years, if not sooner, unless you immediately ditch your cars and start eating insects."</p>
      <p>Carlson then brought on meteorologist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/joe-bastardi">Joe Bastardi</a> who said that he doesn't think Democrats want sensible solutions.</p>
      <p>"I don't think they want this to go away," he said. " I think there's only one answer that they want and this is a new green deal we could all get behind: let's plant more trees."</p>
      <p>Bastardi said that the planet is "now greener than it's ever been in the satellite era."</p>

      <p>"Why are we going to spend $10 trillion to save .01 Celsius over thirty years when we could try this?" he asked.</p>
      <p>Later in the show, Carlson agreed when guest Mark Steyn called out the frequent air travel of potential 2012 candidate <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-bloomberg-2020-run-democrat-reaction-ingraham">Michael Bloomberg</a> between New York and Bermuda. Steyn joked that the Atlantic Ocean between New York and Bermuda could be filled if Bloomberg planted a tree for every mile of private air travel.</p>
      <p>"This whole thing presupposes there is a natural ruling class that is entitled to live differently than you," Steyn argued.</p>
