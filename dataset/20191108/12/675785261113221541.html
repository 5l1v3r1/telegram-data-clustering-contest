      <p>A mother has dramatically admitted murdering her two children after they were found dead in their car seats.</p>
      <p>Brittany Velasquez was due to stand trial next month but accepted a plea deal with prosecutors over the deaths of Christopher and Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old mum is said to have left two-year-old son Christopher and 10-month-old daughter Brooklyn in a car outside her home in Arizona, USA on March 26, last year.</p>
      <p>A coroner ruled both died of exposure.</p>
      <p>Their mother admitted second-degree murder and is due to be sentenced in February next year.</p>
      <p>She had been widowed just nine months before her children's deaths.</p>
      <p>Pinal Deputy County Attorney Shawn Jensvold tells People, in the US: "She agreed to a stipulated term of 20 years flat followed by lifetime probation.</p>
      <p>"She won’t be eligible for early release."</p>

      <p>Velasquez had been investigated by the Arizona Department of Child Safety (DCS) twice for alleged neglect, and local police visited the house multiple times over the years, local media reported.</p>
      <p>The DCS confirmed they received two reports of alleged neglect but found no evidence of abuse.</p>
      <p>The first call came in October 2016, when the department received a report alleging that Velasquez would leave her son home with her mother for long periods of time.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “The child was seen on multiple occasions during the investigation.</p>
      <p>"The DCS investigator concluded there were no indications the child was being abused or neglected and there were no legal grounds to remove the child."</p>

      <p>The case was eventually closed after local authorities visited the children’s grandmother’s home and found no evidence a child had been harmed.</p>
      <p>In January she was reported again for leaving the children with her mother, while she worked.</p>
      <p>The DCS spokesman added: "We searched Velasquez’s apartment, enrolled her in a home visitation program, signed the children up for daycare at no extra cost and determined that there were no signs of abuse or neglect."</p>
