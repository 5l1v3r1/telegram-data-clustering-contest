      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish nationalists said on Friday they would support ‘progressive politics’ if the election threw up a hung parliament and refused to rule out propping up Labour to get another independence referendum.</p>
      <p>When asked if the Scottish National Party would support Labour to allow Jeremy Corbyn to form a government, the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford told ITV: “We simply don’t want Boris Johnson to be prime minister.”</p>
      <p>“We will support progressive politics,” Blackford said. “But the simple fact is: anybody, Jeremy (Corbyn), Boris (Johnson) or anybody else must respect Scotland and must respect the votes of the Scottish people in demanding we have the right to determine our future.”</p>
      <p>He said there would be no formal coalition with any other party but repeatedly sidestepped a question on whether the party would prop up a Labour government.</p>
