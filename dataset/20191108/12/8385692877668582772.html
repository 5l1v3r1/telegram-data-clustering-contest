      <p>Samsung had announced its Exynos 980 processor back in September, and it seems like <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/chinese-smartphones">Vivo</a> will utilize it soon. Vivo <a href="https://www.weibo.com/1809745371/If7gYiBBt?type=comment#_rnd1573200672567">confirmed</a> via Weibo (Chinese social media network) that the Vivo X30 will be <a href="https://www.fonearena.com/blog/297445/vivo-x30-launch-date-exynos-980-5g.html">fueled</a> by the Exynos 980.</p>
      <p>The company also confirmed that this phone will become official in December. Vivo did not reveal the exact date of its announcement, though, so stay tuned for that.</p>
      <h3>The Vivo X30 is set to become the first phone to ship with the Exynos 980</h3>
      <p>The Vivo X30 will become the company's new flagship handset, by the way. The Exynos 980 is a really powerful processor, which is made using an 8nm manufacturing process.</p>

      <p>This processor supports both SA and NSA dual-mode 5G, which is probably why Vivo chose it. It has two high-performing ARM Cortex-A77 cores, and six efficient Cortex-A55 cores. On top of that, it includes the ARM Mali-G76 MP5 GPU.</p>
      <p>The included modem supports E-ULTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC), which combines 2CC LTE and 5G connectivity. This maximizes mobile downlink speed up to 3.55Gbps, and 5G NR Sub-6GHz speeds of up to 2.55Gbps.</p>
      <p>All in all, it's a really powerful processor, and it seems like a great fit for the Vivo X30. The Vivo X30 is actually expected to arrive in two variants, the regular one, and the 'Pro' one. Both phones are expected to include the same processor.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Vivo X30 is rumored to feature a 6.5-inch fullHD+ AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. On top of that, the phone will feature 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB / 256GB of UFS 2.1 internal storage.</p>
      <p>Android will come pre-installed on the device, along with Funtouch OSâ€¦ that goes for the 'Pro' model as well. A 64-megapixel main camera will be included on the back of this phone, along with 13, 8, and 2-megapixel sensors. A 32-megapixel selfie camera will also be a part of the package.</p>
      <p>The device will feature a 3.5mm headphone jack, and an in-display fingerprint scanner. A 4,500mAh battery is rumored for this phone, along with 22.5W fast wired charging.</p>

      <h3>The 'Pro' model set to include a larger display, more RAM, and faster charging</h3>
      <p>In the case of the Vivo X30 Pro, things are a bit different. The device is expected to feature a 6.89-inch fullHD+ 90Hz AMOLED display. It will come in both 8GB and 12GB RAM variants, with 128GB and 256GB of storage. Unlike the Vivo X30, this phone will include UFS 3.0 flash storage, if rumors are accurate.</p>
      <p>The phone will include two SIM card slots, like the Vivo X30, but its rear camera setup will be a bit different. This phone will utilize Sony's 60-megapixel camera (IMX686), not Samsung's 64-megapixel one like the Vivo X30.</p>
      <p>In addition to that camera, Vivo will also include one 12-megapixel, and two 13-megapixel cameras on the back. The same 32-megapixel camera as on the Vivo X30 will be included on the front.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>This phone will include the same 4,500mAh battery like the Vivo X30, but with faster charging. The device will support 44W fast wired charging, according to rumors.</p>
