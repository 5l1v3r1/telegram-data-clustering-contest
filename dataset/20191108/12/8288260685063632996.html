      <h1>'Underdogs' - Birmingham City star makes promotion declaration and reveals Pep Clotet's true impact</h1>
      <h2>Latest Birmingham City news | The 22-year-old moved to St Andrew's in the summer and has been a regular in Pep Clotet's starting line-up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:36:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:36</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Birmingham City midfielder Dan Crowley has certainly made an impact at St Andrew’s following his summer move from Willem II.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has featured in all but one of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> ’ Sky Bet Championship matches this season, and has quickly settled in to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/not-here-win-awards-bela-17219264">Pep Clotet</a> ’s methods.</p>
      <p>The stats do not do Crowley justice, which read three assists and no goals to his name thus far, but the former Arsenal man is often a handful for opposition defences.</p>
      <p>Crowley has spoken about the influence of Blues’ two Gardners, midfielder Gary and player-coach Craig, who helped persuade him to reject moves to PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord in favour of a move to St Andrew’s.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Blues playmaker is also confident that the club can succeed the season, and are “underdogs” in the race for promotion.</p>
      <p>“Craig’s been a great help with his coaching,” Crowley told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/a4e93d0c-0154-11ea-a5c6-614c29c2a639#]">The Times</a> .</p>
      <p>“He’s the link between the players and the staff, the middle man, and I think that helps in a team.</p>
      <p>“The Gaffer (Pep Clotet) is a really intelligent guy. The stuff we work on in training during the week, you can really feel it working on a Saturday.</p>
      <p>“I think we can get promoted. We’re the underdogs as well — no one thinks we’ll go up.”</p>

      <p>Crowley came through the youth ranks at Arsenal, but failed to make a first-team appearance for the Gunners before signing for Eredivisie outfit Willem II on a free transfer in 2017.</p>
      <p>Loan spells at Barnsley, Oxford and Dutch club Go A Eagles haven’t dented Crowley’s confidence.</p>
      <p>The Blues midfielder is determined to go to the very top of the game and play at the highest level.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“No one else is going to believe it if you don’t, are they?” Crowley added.</p>
      <p>“I think I’m good with the ball at my feet, and I can make a difference to the team — that little something extra — where maybe not everyone can.</p>
      <p>“When I was at Arsenal and I trained with the first team, I would think, ‘I am the best player here’. Maybe that mentality was my way of pushing myself. But I did think it as well. I always believed I was the best.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Santi Cazorla was unbelievable, his technique — left and right — was probably the best I’ve seen. [Alexis] Sanchez was so sharp and worked so hard. Wilshere was someone I was compared with, but I don’t want to be compared to anyone. That might sound really big time, but I’m me. And I know that still means nothing really.</p>
      <p>“I want to play in the Premier League, at the top. I want to play in the Champions League. I believe I will.”</p>
