      <h2>Thomas Griffiths killed Ellie Gould in a brutal attack at her family home in family home in Calne, Wiltshire - he was today sentenced to life in prison at Bristol Crown Court</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:02:33+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Claire Hayhurst, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A 17-year-old boy who murdered his ex-girlfriend by stabbing her more than a dozen times has been jailed for life.</p>
      <p>Thomas Griffiths must serve at least 12 years and six months for the murder of Ellie Gould at her family home in Calne, Wiltshire, on May 3.</p>
      <p>After the brutal attack he placed her hand on the knife to make it look like suicide.</p>
      <p>He left the 17-year-old lying in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor, where her father discovered her four hours later.</p>
      <p>Wiltshire Police arrested Griffiths seven miles away from the home a short time after Ellie's body was discovered at about 3.15pm.</p>
      <p>Griffiths, then aged 17, pleaded guilty to a charge of murder during a hearing at Bristol Crown Court in August.</p>
      <p>As he wept in the dock this morning, a letter Griffiths had written expressing remorse for killing someone "so special to (him)" was read out to the court.</p>

      <p>Following the guilty plea Judge Peter Blair QC, the Recorder of Bristol, lifted reporting restrictions preventing the media from identifying Griffiths.</p>
      <p>The teenager initially denied having seen Ellie that day, or in the days before her death.</p>
      <p>Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, said in court today: "Ellie and this defendant had known each other for some time and had been in a relationship since about January 2019.</p>
      <p>"However, in a message sent to friends on social media at 6pm on May 2, Ellie announced that she had split from this defendant and that he had not taken the separation well.</p>

      <p>"Earlier that same day, Ellie had told her friends that she felt suffocated by Griffith's attentions."</p>
      <p>Mr Smith said Griffiths had been driven to school on the morning of May 3 by his mother but he had "no intention" of going.</p>
      <p>He took a bus home before driving to Ellie's family home, arriving there at 10.58am and leaving at 11.51am.</p>
      <p>Griffiths had told the court he and Ellie began to revise but Mr Smith said no revision folders were left out when her body was later discovered.</p>
      <p>"Griffiths became angry, perhaps by Ellie's continued rejection of him and he attacked her," Mr Smith said.</p>

      <p>"A post-mortem examination indicated that Ellie was first incapacitated by pressure having been applied to her neck.</p>
      <p>"Thereafter, multiple knife wounds were inflicted. There are at least 13 wounds inflicted, with the knife focused mainly around the area of the left neck.</p>
      <p>"The knife that was used to kill Ellie was one that was taken from the family kitchen."</p>
      <p>He attempted to clean up the scene with cloths which he later hid in a wood near his home, Mr Smith said.</p>
      <p>Blood-staining on an apron suggests Griffiths wiped the knife before placing it back in Ellie's neck.</p>
      <p>"The defendant must have placed his victim's own hand on the handle of the knife," Mr Smith said.</p>
      <p>"No doubt to make it look as though she, Ellie, had inflicted the wounds on herself."</p>

      <p>After the murder, Griffiths drove home and told a neighbour he had self-harmed, with deep scratches to his neck.</p>
      <p>"In truth, the injuries to the defendant's neck and to his hand were nothing to do with self-infliction but very much more likely the product of his young victim having fought for her life as she was attacked," Mr Smith said.</p>
      <p>Griffiths then asked his neighbour to drive him to school, where he spoke to the matron and sent messages to Ellie's phone.</p>
      <p>He was collected from school from his mother, who later took him to a friend's house in Chippenham.</p>
      <p>At 3pm, Ellie's father Matthew Gould returned home to find his daughter lying "face down in a pool of blood, with the knife in her neck," Mr Smith said.</p>
      <p>In a victim personal statement, Mr Gould said: "The image of Ellie lying there on the floor has haunted me ever since that afternoon.</p>
      <p>"It fills my thoughts when trying to sleep and hijacks my mind when trying to go about my day."</p>
      <p>Griffiths was arrested outside his friend's home at 6pm and "lied repeatedly" to police, Mr Smith told the court.</p>

      <p>Sasha Wass QC, representing Griffiths, said he was an exceptional student who had been made a prefect shortly before the murder.</p>
      <p>He swam at county and international level, and played rugby at county level for Chippenham Rugby Club, she said.</p>
      <p>"Tom was presented with a series of stressful life events," Ms Wass told the court.</p>
      <p>"Tom's father had surgery for cancer and had subsequently been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
      <p>"Tom's grandmother had a series of life-threatening illnesses. As well as the illnesses, Tom was under the pressure put on so many - the prospect of exams."</p>
      <p>Ms Wass said Griffiths had been in a "state of denial" after the murder.</p>
      <p>"Tom, rather than acting as a master criminal, simply wanted to behave as if nothing has happened," she said.</p>
      <p>"Within three weeks he accepted what he had done.</p>

      <p>"Both families have been devastated by what Thomas Griffiths did. No-one bears that burden more than Tom does."</p>
      <p>Ms Wass read a letter written to the court by Griffiths, in which he apologised for his actions.</p>
      <p>"Ever since that dreadful day, I have tried to come to terms with what I have done," Griffiths wrote.</p>
      <p>"All I feel is remorse for Ellie and her family after I took such a special daughter and sister away from them.</p>
      <p>"I feel confused and angry at myself at how I was able to hurt someone so special to me and others.</p>
      <p>"At the time, my mental health was not good and I wish I had recognised this.</p>
      <p>"As well as this, I would like to apologise to my family who are truly devastated by my actions and what happened.</p>
      <p>"I have truly let myself down and I hope one day I will be able to explain to myself and others why this happened.</p>
      <p>"I'm so sorry. I know my apologies and explanations will never be enough but I hope in time I can show how truly sorry I am."</p>
      <p>As Griffith's letter was read to the court, Ellie's mother stared at him and shook her head.</p>
      <p>His parents, who were sat near the dock, wept through the proceedings, as did their son.</p>

      <p>Mr Justice Garnham, sentencing, said Ellie's father initially believed the wounds suffered by his daughter were self-inflicted when he discovered her body.</p>
      <p>"There can be no more dreadful scene for any parent to contemplate than that which confronted Ellie's father when he came home that day from work," the judge said.</p>
      <p>"He came into his kitchen at about 3pm to find his beloved daughter laying on the floor in a pool of her own blood, her neck and face cut about, and a kitchen knife embedded in her throat.</p>
      <p>"She was stiff and cold and entirely beyond saving."</p>
      <p>The judge said Griffiths had set a "false trail" on social media after the murder, sending messages to Ellie and her friends.</p>
      <p>"The effect of your actions has not only been to snuff out the life of this bright, intelligent, talented and vivacious young woman with her whole life before her, but also to wreak misery and heartbreak on her family and friends."</p>
      <p>Griffiths bowed his head as the judge jailed him for life and ordered him to serve a minimum sentence of 12 years and six months.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In a statement released today Det Chief Insp Jim Taylor said: "While I know that this prison sentence will not bring Ellie back, and 12 and a half years no doubt seems insignificant given the severity of this crime and the colossal loss for this family, I hope that in some way it provides them with some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I know Ellie's friends have been a huge comfort to the Gould family in the months that have followed her death - their admirable commitment to fundraising in Ellie's name has no doubt provided much-needed focus for the family.</p>
      <p>"I hope they continue to remember Ellie as the bright and caring person that she was."</p>
      <p>In a tribute issued after her death, Ellie's family described her as "fun-loving and a joy to be around".</p>
      <p>They added: "We would like Ellie to be remembered as a kind, caring young lady with a wonderful, fun personality."</p>

      <p>Lisa Percy, headteacher of Hardenhuish School, said pupils and staff had been left "absolutely devastated" by the murder.</p>
      <p>"Her close knit group of friends have shown strength beyond their young years in the months that have followed Ellie’s death, and have supported one another extraordinarily well."</p>
      <p>Neighbours in Calne said horse-mad Ellie had recently turned 17 and dad Matthew, 50, was teaching her to drive.</p>
      <p>Mr Gould and Ellie's mother, 48 year old Carole, own a kitchen fitting business together.</p>
      <p>They have a 19-year-old son called Ben.</p>
      <p>Before a private funeral service was held in July, the family told how Ellie was looking forward to a bright future and considering a career as a police officer.</p>
      <p>They said: “We talked about visits to university open days and apprenticeships within the police force – she wondered if she could get into the mounted police with her riding skills.</p>
      <p>“Whilst she was excited about the next step in her life she also said, 'But I don’t want the sixth form to end as I love it so much'.</p>
      <p>“Ellie had a lovely relationship with her older brother growing up, they rarely argued as she was fun loving and a joy to be around."</p>
