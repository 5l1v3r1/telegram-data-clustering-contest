      <p>Anyone with an inclination toward the underground aesthetic has likely stumbled across the work of <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/wiki/profile">Wiki</a>. Fresh off the release of his new album <i>OOFIE, </i>the New York lyricist has been putting in work alongside some of the game's grimiest bar spitters. On "Grim," Wiki links with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/denzelcurry/profile">Denzel Curry</a> and Lil Ugly Mane, an elusive chap to be sure, and what results is some truly rugged and raw hip-hop. Off the bat, Wiki sets it off with a laid-back yet brilliantly constructed rhyme scheme, his singsong voice luring you into a false sense of security. As his verse progresses, his lines are enunciated by ominous strings, giving the track a spooky vibe.</p>
      <p>Lil Ugly Mane, himself the opposite of prolific, holds it down for the second verse; though his output has slowed, his intensity has yet to falter. Denzel Curry, <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/denzel-curry-and-joey-badass-waged-a-war-for-the-ages-at-zeltron-world-wide-news.95032.html">fresh off the raucous Zeltron World Wide event</a>, shuts it down with peak backpacker energy. It's always interesting to hear him switch the style over production of this nature, a testament to his versatility and roots as a hip-hop scholar. Check out "Grim" now, especially if you're looking for a break from the expected.</p>

          <b>Quotable Lyrics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Pointless, nine-millimeter might leave me voiceless<br/>Appointed to a therapist when I'm very pissed, I'm arrogant<br/>Tellin' myself that I be fine, it's the point where it's <a href="https://genius.com/Wiki-grim-lyrics#note-18403344">scary, yes</a><br/>Carried this burden, for certain, I just need a surgeon<br/>To take away all my emotions, my system is nervous<br/>You only think deep when a fuckin' shrink speaks<br/>Only time I count sheep is when a n***a six feet<br/>Six deep, ten toes, nah, that's sixty-fours<br/>N***, I don't play games, N64</p>
      <p>- DENZEL</p>
