      <h3>NEWLY-appointed Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta yesterday vowed to be objective and impartial with the electoral protest filed by former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against Vice President Leni Robredo.</h3>
      <p>“In so far as the PET case, I’ve been always objective with the performance on my work, I always rely on the evidence submitted and the law applicable,” Peralta said during his first Meet the Press event at the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>Peralta likewise belied insinuations that he was favoring the Marcoses when he penned the ruling allowing the remains of former president Ferdinand Marcos to be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.</p>
      <p>“It’s not correct that I’ve been favoring the Marcoses, it’s the only decision that I favored the Marcoses, it’s only the burial,” said Peralta.</p>
      <p>He argued that there was no law prohibiting a former president to be laid to rest at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.</p>
      <p>“In the case of the burial, there is no law or a resolution prohibiting the burial of a president. So what shall we do? We cannot resolve cases based on public opinion,” Peralta said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Peralta disclosed that the Presidential Electoral Tribunal allowed the camps of Marcos and Robredo to photocopy some of the election documents.</p>
