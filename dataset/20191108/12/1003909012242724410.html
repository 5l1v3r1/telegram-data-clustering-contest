      <h1>Their own way: Curses, breakups, religious cults and the long, strange trajectory of Fleetwood Mac</h1>

      <p>“I’ve always been the troublemaker in Fleetwood Mac.”</p>
      <p>This was guitarist and singer-songwriter Lindsey Buckingham’s take on his role in the 52-year-old, ever-morphing band back in 2014, when the British rock magazine Mojo did an article about the troubled, cocaine-fuelled creation of the 1977 classic, Rumours. Buckingham was talking about the new musical direction Fleetwood Mac took under his uncompromising vision in the mid-1970s, driving them to meticulous California pop-rock and further from the British blues-based DNA of the band’s original sound. The most recent bout of drama for Fleetwood Mac was his ouster back in 2018. The rest of the band initially suggested it was because he had asked for too much time off to concentrate on his solo career, while Buckingham maintained it was because of conflict with his former lover Stevie Nicks at a MusiCares benefit concert honouring the band in New York earlier that year. Buckingham told Rolling Stone that the firing was due to him offending Nicks by complaining about the band entering the stage to her song Rhiannon and then smirking during her lengthy thank-you speech. Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie would later <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fleetwood-mac-say-lindsey-buckingham-2463856">confirm Buckingham’s version of events to NME.</a></p>
      <p>It wasn’t the first time Buckingham left Fleetwood Mac and, in terms of Mac drama, this latest chapter seems relatively minor. Few bands have had the volatile history of Fleetwood Mac, an act anchored by its rhythm section of bassist John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood but creatively driven by a series of mercurial guitarists and songwriters.</p>
      <p>If Mac actually arrives in Calgary on Nov. 10 for a Saddledome show — they have postponed twice since 2018, after all — it will be with guitarist Mike Campbell from Tom Petty’s Heartbreakers and Crowded House frontman Neil Finn, just the latest personnel changes for the act. It’s the most recent wrinkle in a tumultuous career that has included romantic strife between members, religious cults, mental illness, mountains of cocaine and even a suicide.</p>
      <p>So here are some of the darkly interesting tidbits about the long, stranger-than-fiction trajectory of Fleetwood Mac.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Origins</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, the formation of Fleetwood Mac back in the late 1960s was anything but straightforward. But we can start with Mick Fleetwood’s membership in Peter Bardens’ Peter B’s Looners, an R&amp;B act in the mid-1960s that would eventually include a young Rod Stewart and teen guitarist Peter Green. Green would become Mac’s first visionary leader, but not before doing time with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. That British blues band featured John McVie on bass and, briefly, Fleetwood on drums. Fleetwood and McVie became the rhythm section for some hasty demos of Green’s songs after Mayall bought the guitarist a few hours of studio time as a birthday gift. The resulting tracks included one that Green named Fleetwood Mac. Those sessions eventually led Green to forming Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac, although it would take some time to pry McVie away from his lucrative gig with Mayall. Officially, Bob Brunning was Mac’s first bassist, but according to Fleetwood’s 2014 autobiography, Play On, Brunning was told upfront that he was simply a placeholder until McVie joined the fold. That happened in December of 1967 and Fleetwood Mac was born.</p>

        <b>The curse? </b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the Daily Mail, it was Buckingham who reportedly summed up the band’s wild history as “The Curse of the Fleetwood Mac guitarist.” The most unusual aspect of the band’s dynamic has always been how mainstays McVie and Fleetwood contributed relatively little to Mac’s creative direction over its many incarnations. Instead, that was left to a revolving door of gifted, troubled and often doomed guitarists. Green would eventually leave Fleetwood Mac and battle years of mental illness, which Fleetwood believes stemmed from a bad LSD trip. The band’s second original guitarist, Jeremy Spencer, disappeared mid-tour after doing some mescaline and joining the Children of God religious cult on Hollywood Boulevard, an outfit he is still involved in to this day.</p>
      <p>“His long hair had been shorn to his skull, he was wearing dirty clothes and he would only answer to the name Jonathan,” Fleetwood writes in Play On.</p>
      <p>When both Green and Spencer were still in the band, a third guitarist name Danny Kirwan joined the act as a creative foil for Green. But he would eventually clash with Spencer’s replacement, Bob Welch, becoming the first member to be fired from Fleetwood Mac after he smashed his head against a wall, trashed a dressing room and refused to perform. During the recording of Rumours, Kirwan paid the band one last visit and told Fleetwood he had been working odd jobs and was homeless.</p>
      <p>“He kept scratching himself and told us that he was living in a shelter and had contracted ‘worms’,” the drummer wrote in his autobiography. Kirwan died in 2018.</p>
      <p>Kirwan was replaced by Bob Weston, who was eventually fired by the band after having an affair with Fleetwood’s wife, Jenny. Weston died in 2012 of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage.</p>
      <p>Welch would eventually quit the band in a relatively amicable fashion and enjoy moderate success as a solo act. But, like the others, he came to a tragic end. “The man that saved Fleetwood Mac,” as Fleetwood referred to him in that 2014 Mojo article, committed suicide in 2012 after spinal surgery.</p>

        <b>Rumours </b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the most intriguing aspects of Fleetwood Mac’s considerable lore has been the romantic turmoil in which their most successful album, 1977’s Rumours, was recorded. Rumours is the 14th biggest-selling album of all time, arguably the creative peak in a period that began after Fleetwood convinced musical and romantic partners Buckingham and Nicks to abandon their fledgling music career and join his band. This happened after Fleetwood, Welch and John and Christine McVie moved to Los Angeles in the wake of the band’s abandoned U.S. tour, which was cancelled after Weston’s affair with Fleetwood’s wife. Fleetwood, who would eventually divorce Jenny not once but twice, wasn’t the only member having problems with his love life. Rumours was the second Mac record Nicks and Buckingham contributed to after the band’s 1975 self-titled comeback. But the couple broke midway through recording the 1977 classic, which Buckingham suggested was precipitated by the McVies breaking up after Christine’s affair with the band’s lighting director. Whatever the case, much has been made about how these ongoing romantic dramas fed into the classic songs on Rumours, particularly Buckingham’s Go Your Own Way and Nick’s Dreams. In 2014, Buckingham told British journalist Mark Blake from Mojo that his first instinct upon hearing a Fleetwood Mac song on the radio from that period is to change the channel.</p>
      <p>“I guess it’s because it might dredge up the subtext around the songs, and that’s not always pleasant,” he said.</p>
