      <h1>Top cops hits out after attacks on his officers</h1>
      <h2>Chief Inspector Brian Anderson has condemned a series of attacks on his officers — which saw one taken to hospital with alleged bite marks on their arm.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:31:29+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Behan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-behan/</a></address>
      <p>Four of his serving officers were subjected to assaults by members of the public.</p>
      <p>The Post has learned that the assaults took place late last month as hard-working officers were in the execution of their duty.</p>
      <p>In one incident a cop was hospitalised.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the officer who was the alleged victim of the bite to their arm, was back on duty the following day.</p>
      <p>News of the incidents follows recent media coverage of attacks on police, which have more than doubled since the formation of Police Scotland six years ago.</p>
      <p>Locally, Ayrshire has seen one of the highest increases on police attacks.</p>
      <p>In the first year of the unified force, 778 attacks were carried out on officers and civilian staff across the country in the last 12 months, the number of assaults has risen to 1685 – an increase of 52 per cent in six years.</p>
      <p>The figures, released by Police Scotland under freedom of information, also show that the two areas which recorded the next highest number of police assaults were Ayrshire and Glasgow- with 189 attacks each.</p>
      <p>CI Anderson shared his disappointment on social media.</p>
      <p>He said: “Disappointed to come to work to find four officers subject of assaults overnight, with one requiring hospital treatment after allegedly being bitten on the arm.</p>
      <p>“Officers do not come to work to be assaulted- it’s not in the job description! Those who do assault cops end up in one place.”</p>
