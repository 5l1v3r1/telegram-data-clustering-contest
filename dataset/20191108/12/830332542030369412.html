      <h1>Disney: Hong Kong protests hit theme park profit</h1>
      <h2>Protests have gripped city for months</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:45:24+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author">Sherisse Pham, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Hong Kong's <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/31/business/hong-kong-economy/index.html">political crisis</a> is hitting the local Disneyland hard.</p>
      <p>Disney <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/07/media/disney-q4-earnings/index.html">reported strong earnings</a> on Thursday but flagged mounting losses at its theme park in Hong Kong, where protests <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/asia/hong-kong-destruction-support-intl-hnk/index.html">have gripped the city for months</a> and walloped its tourism industry.</p>
      <p>If the current trends continue, operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland could fall by $275 million in Disney's current fiscal year, which ends in September 2020, the company's chief financial officer Christine McCarthy said during an earnings call.</p>
      <p>The local theme park was a drag on international business last quarter, when operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland fell $55 million, offsetting growth at parks in Paris and Shanghai. McCarthy warned profit could fall by $80 million in the current quarter.</p>
      <p>As a whole, Disney's parks unit — which it breaks out in its earnings report as parks, experiences and products — brought in $1.4 billion in operating income for the fourth quarter, a 17% increase over the same time last year.</p>
      <p>Disney's warning underscores the gloomy picture for Hong Kong's economy. Official data released last week confirmed what many had feared: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/business/hong-kong-economy/index.html">The city has plunged into recession</a>, after months of protests have forced shops to close, paralyzed public transportation and scared off tourists.</p>
      <p>Visitors to Hong Kong plummeted 37% in the third quarter, <a href="https://www.fso.gov.hk/eng/blog/blog271019.htm">according to the city's financial secretary</a>. Hotels were on average only two-thirds full, a drop of 28% compared to the same period a year earlier.</p>
      <p>With no immediate resolution to the city's political crisis in the cards, economists say Hong Kong's first recession in a decade could extend into the new year.</p>
