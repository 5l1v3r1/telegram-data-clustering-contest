          <b>Bala Movie Review : Bald is beautiful, indeed</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>As per the report in the Boxofficeindia.com, the film has opened to a good occupancy of around 25-30%. The film is expected to pick up the pace by evening. However, the occupancy is lower than that of Ayushmann's previous film '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dream-Girl">Dream Girl</a>' as mass centers were less.</p>
      <p>'Dream Girl' also did not open well outside multiplexes, however, it was the actor's best film to rake in good figures from mass centers. The first-day collection of 'Dream Girl' also marked Ayushmann's biggest opening. The film raked in close to Rs 10 crore on its opening day at the box office. The film had registered an occupancy of 30%.</p>
      <p>However, 'Bala' has a chance to be similar to the opening day figure of 'Dream Girl' as it should do better in the evening in the bigger multiplexes as it has a wider release.</p>
      <p>'Bala' is Ayushmann Khurrana's biggest release till date. The film released across 3000 screens in India and more than 550 screens in the overseas markets. However, the film will largely remain a multiplex film in the tier A cities despite a bigger release.</p>
      <p>Directed by Amar Kaushik, 'Bala' is a film set in Kanpur that revolves around a man suffering from premature balding and the lack of confidence and societal pressure which runs with it. The film also features <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhumi-Pednekar">Bhumi Pednekar</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Yami-Gautam">Yami Gautam</a> in lead roles.</p>
