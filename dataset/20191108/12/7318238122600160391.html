      <p>HONG KONG — A Hong Kong college student on Friday became the first person to die in relation to increasingly violent <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/mask-wearing-hong-kong-students-turn-graduation-protest-n1078031">anti-government</a>protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese region, sparking further outrage among demonstrators.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of masked protesters <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-introduces-emergency-powers-ban-face-masks-protests-n1062301">defied a government ban on face masks</a> and marched through a busy central district calling for revenge after the death of Chow Tsz-lok, 22, who fell in a multistory parking lot on Monday after police used tear gas on demonstrators in the area.</p>
      <p>Queen Elizabeth Hospital confirmed Chow's death but did not disclose why he died. Police have said its crime unit would conduct a full investigation.</p>
      <p>Monday's demonstrations were part of a series of anti-government protests triggered by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-s-carrie-lam-withdraws-extradition-bill-sparked-protest-n1049436">a now-withdrawn extradition bill</a> in June. The protests have since morphed to include calls for greater democratic freedoms amid fears of China's increased control over the territory.</p>
      <p>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where Chow was studying, issued a statement of condolences to his family and offering support to his classmates while trying to quell anger.</p>

      <p>The university "urges all students to stay calm and exercise restraint at this difficult time, to avoid any further conflicts or tragedies from happening."</p>
      <p>Vigils are expected to be held in eight districts throughout the city with a moment of silence to commemorate Chow. Organizers have encouraged mourners to bring flowers and candles, instead of burning incense, because Chow was Christian.</p>
      <p>More protests are planned through the weekend and risk turning violent with the momentum built following Chow's death.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pro-china-lawmaker-stabbed-hong-kong-amid-anti-government-tensions-n1077061">a pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong was stabbed</a>by a civilian and another lawmaker had <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-lawmaker-s-ear-partially-bitten-during-anti-government-n1075891">part of his ear bitten off</a>in a separate incident.</p>
