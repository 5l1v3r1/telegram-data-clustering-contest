      <h2>West Highland terrier helps out at school rehearsals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:31:29+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rachel-clark/</a></address>
      <p>A West Highland terrier has been helping out as a Perthshire school prepares for its end-of-term concert.</p>
      <p>Lottie the dog has been offering her support to pupils at Glenalmond College who have been busy rehearsing for the school’s senior musical ‘Anything Goes’, which will be staged at the end of the month.</p>
      <p>The friendly terrier has been enjoying rehearsing with the 34-strong cast and her owner Tim Ridley, who is the college’s musical director - and she even seems keen to be considered for the canine role ‘Cheeky’ in the musical production.</p>
      <p>Anything Goes is set in 1934 and is based on the madcap antics on board an ocean liner bound from New York to London.</p>
      <p>Billy Crocker is a stowaway in love with heiress Hope Harcourt, who is engaged to Lord Evelyn Oakleigh.</p>
      <p>Nightclub singer Reno Sweeney and public enemy number 13 ‘Moonface’ Martin, aid Billy in his quest to win Hope on a voyage packed with flappers, gangsters and mistaken identities.</p>
      <p>Liz Moss, director of theatre at Glenalmond College, said this year’s choice of musical offers an exciting opportunity for pupils to work together in a big ensemble production.</p>
      <p>She said the musical has sparkle, comedy and panache all delivered at break-neck speed, but also with real tenderness.</p>
      <p>Liz said: “We have some really talented young actors in our senior years and Anything Goes will give them a chance to shine in a production which depends on teamwork and impeccable timing.</p>
      <p>“Staff and pupils are very much looking forward to opening night.</p>
      <p>“One of my favourite experiences in teaching drama is watching the transformation which occurs when the pupils go in front of a live audience.</p>
      <p>“It gives them a huge lift to get that interaction with the audience.”</p>
      <p>Several of the college’s teaching staff are also joining in again as part of the cast and the nine-piece band.</p>
      <p>Tim Ridley, director of music at Glenalmond College, said: “There are very few musicals which have so many brilliant songs - it is simply jam-packed with great music.</p>
      <p>“I have always loved Anything Goes but the highly complex jazz score makes it the toughest show I have ever directed musically.”</p>
      <p>Anything Goes will be performed at Glenalmond College’s theatre over four nights from Thursday, November 28 until Sunday, December 1 and tickets can be booked online via Eventbrite or by emailing info@glenalmondcollege.co.uk</p>
