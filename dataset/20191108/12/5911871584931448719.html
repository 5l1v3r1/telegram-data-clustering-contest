      <p>The holiday standard “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” has come under fire in recent years. A common complaint against the tune is that its lyrics — which present a push and pull between a woman attempting to leave for the night and a man trying to convince her to stay — carry overtones of sexual harassment and coercion. Many have used the word “rapey” to describe the song’s connotation to the modern ear, even if others have argued that <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/andyneuenschwander/someone-wrote-a-feminist-defense-of-baby-its-col">it was quite progressive in its time</a> and was actually a nod to women’s liberation. Either way, the song’s yuletide ubiquity persists, and it continues to be awkward.</p>
      <p>John Legend’s solution to was to record a “modern and irreverent” new version of “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” with <i>Insecure</i>’s Natasha Rothwell, to record it with his fellow <i>The Voice</i> affiliate Kelly Clarkson, and to release it on the deluxe reissue of <i>A Legendary Christmas</i>, his holiday collection from last year executive produced by Raphael Saadiq. The resulting remake has gotten more media attention than <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062858/christmas-albums-2019/franchises/the-week-in-pop/">all the other Christmas music coming out this season</a> combined.</p>
      <p>The deluxe version of <i>A Legendary Christmas</i> is out today, and therefore so is the woke “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.” It subs in lyrics like, “My mother will start to worry (I’ll call a car and tell ‘em to hurry)/ My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait, what are you still livin’ home for?).” And when Clarkson sings, “What will my friends think if I have one more drink?” Legend replies, “It’s your body and your choice.”</p>
      <p>Not everyone is thrilled about this turn of events. Earlier this week, Deana Martin, daughter of famed “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” singer Dean Martin, called in to <i>Good Morning Britain</i> to <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063944/dean-martin-baby-its-cold-outside-john-legend-kelly-clarkson/news/">complain about Legend’s remake</a>. Among her critiques: “You do not change the lyrics to the song. He’s made it more sexual with those words that he has just said. It’s absolutely absurd.”</p>
