      <p>The Guardian photographer Murdo MacLeod recently took a morning drive around Loch Tummel, north-west of Pitlochry, in Perth and Kinross, Scotland – a stunning, narrow freshwater loch surrounded by forest, trails and breathtaking views. “I was on a mission to capture the autumn colours,” he says. “There was a light frost, and a mist loitering in the hollows. It was very still and beautiful.” The trees on the shoreline and the peak above are reflected in the water, framed by silhouetted branches: the perfect autumn scene.</p>
