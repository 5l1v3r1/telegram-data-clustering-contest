      <p>PONTIAN, Nov 8 — The proposed amendments to the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (Sosma) will allow for a better implementation of the law to safeguard peace and public order in the country, said Home Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.</p>
      <p>Muhyiddin said among the provisions to be covered by the review is the 28-day detention period, which some consider to be too long.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday, I was told the 28-day detention period under Sosma is too long, a torture. We take note of this view but we also have to consider the opinion of the police as the enforcer of anti-terrorism laws.</p>
      <p>Muhyiddin said there were several suggestions to improve this aspect of the law, including allowing a 14-day detention for investigation before applying for an extension of 14 days from the court.</p>
      <p>“So, there will be a process of checks and balances,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In my opinion, what has been decided by Pakatan Harapan, including the promise in the manifesto, remains. We will not abolish Sosma. We will just amend it,” he told a press conference after visiting the Pekan Nanas police station near here today.</p>
      <p>He said engagement with stakeholders like Members of Parliament, the Bar Council and academicians would continue before the proposed amendments are finalised for Cabinet approval.</p>
      <p>Muhyiddin had been reported as saying that the government was expected to table the SOSMA amendments in the Dewan Rakyat in March next year.</p>
      <p>Muhyiddin said what the government was doing now was not linked solely to the LTTE but also involved cross-border crime and terrorism which needed to be tackled together.</p>
      <p>“We need international cooperation and we need to step up our enforcement. We share information with like-minded countries (in combating terrorism),” he said. ― Bernama</p>
