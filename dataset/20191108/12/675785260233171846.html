      <h1>Joey Barton apologises for 'cheerleader' rant at Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp</h1>
      <h2>Fleetwood boss and former Manchester City midfielder Joey Barton says he got it right with his assessment of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:11:58+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Joey Barton has apologised to Jurgen Klopp - and compared the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> boss to the legendary Bill Shankly.</p>
      <p>Barton, who is now manager at Fleetwood Town, branded Klopp a "giant German cheerleader" in an explosive rant in 2017.</p>
      <p>Klopp has since led Liverpool to the Champions League and his side could end the weekend nine points clear at the top of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> midfielder Barton admits he got it wrong and has now apologised to Klopp.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think Liverpool back in the day were anywhere near as strong as they are now with the fans and the belief,” Barton told talkSPORT.</p>

      <p>“I’ve been critical of Jurgen Klopp, I didn’t feel they were learning lessons.</p>
      <p>“But I think they are the most improved team and his is the most improved coach in the last three years.</p>
      <p>“He has that, I dare say, Shankly feel to him.</p>
      <p>“He has lifted the whole city and Liverpool really firmly believe.</p>
      <p>“I live in the city and I’m just hoping <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> can get on the coat tails and latch onto that energy to improve themselves.”</p>

      <p>Despite their advantage at the top of the table, Mohamed Salah has warned his teammates that a win for the Reds over City this weekend will mean little in the title picture.</p>
      <p>"They were talking about that in December last year when we were six or seven points ahead," Salah told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"Even if we win, it is a long way. We are in November, it is too early to talk about the Premier League."</p>
