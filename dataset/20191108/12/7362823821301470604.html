      <p>The 26-year-old was initially stopped for playing music out of his car too loud, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/06/dallas-cowboys-daniel-ross-arrested-weed-gun-charges/">TMZ Sports</a> reported, citing a police report.

      <p>The officer said he smelled a “strong odor” of marijuana emanating from the vehicle and before the car was searched Ross told the officer there was a handgun inside, TMZ Sports reported. The officer reportedly discovered a Springfield XD 9mm handgun and .12 ounces of weed in the car.</p>

      <p>According to an arrest video, obtained by TMZ Sports, Ross told the officer there was weed and a gun in the car because he and his friends brought marijuana to the gun range the day prior. The officer chided Ross for doing that.</p>

      <p>“I'm assuming if you play for the Cowboys, you've got a lot to lose,” the officer said. “I mean, you've got to think about those things!”</p>
