      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ryan-sessegnon">Ryan Sessegnon</a> has been handed an instant <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-under-21">England Under-21</a> recall following his return from injury.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham</a> wideman is back in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/aidy-boothroyd">Aidy Boothroyd</a>’s squad after a hamstring problem which forced him to miss the first three months of the season.</p>
      <p>The Young Lions travel to Albania for their Euro 2021 qualifier next Friday before a friendly in Holland on November 19.</p>
      <p>Sessegnon only made his debut for Spurs in last weekend’s 1-1 draw at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Everton">Everton</a> following a £25million summer move from Fulham.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterUnited">Manchester United</a>’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mason-greenwood">Mason Greenwood</a> returns after missing the last squad through injury with Ben Godfrey, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/reece-james">Reece James</a> and Reiss Nelson also recalled following knocks.</p>
      <p>Boothroyd said: “These are two really difficult games and trips which will be a good challenge for the team.</p>
      <p>“Albania are well-organised, physically strong, they will be difficult to break down and a threat on the counter-attack.</p>
      <p>“But it’s a chance for us to consolidate our position at the top of the qualification group ahead of the big international break.</p>
      <p>“We’re also pleased to play an excellent side in Netherlands, who are really re-emerging on the international stage.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a pretty steady squad from the last games. We’ve lost a few players through injury but it’s giving other players an opportunity to be involved and we’re looking forward to really putting ourselves to the test in these two matches.”</p>
      <p>West Brom’s West Ham loanee Grady Diangana and QPR’s Ebere Eze have earned their first call-ups.</p>
      <p>Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden is also included along with Bournemouth duo Aaron Ramsdale and Lloyd Kelly and Burnley’s Dwight McNeil.</p>
      <p>The Young Lions are top of Group Three, ahead of Austria on goal difference with a game in hand.</p>
