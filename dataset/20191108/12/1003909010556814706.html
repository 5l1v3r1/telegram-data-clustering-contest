      <h3>Alberta is a great place for green technology</h3>
      <p>Albertans should be asking why all of our oil patch companies have not gotten into green technology. There are billions of dollars to be made there. These oil companies have a glorious opportunity to make big bucks on green technology. Why are they not building electric cars? Anyway, Alberta is a perfect place for green technology. A highly trained workforce, lots of land, lots of sunshine, lots of wind. You may have noted that Warren Buffett, the genius investor as already investing in green technology in Alberta.</p>

      <h3>Why are teachers the first to go?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Province puts schools in a squeeze, Nov. 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>I would like to know why the Calgary School Boards first line of defence, anytime they have budget issues, is to fire teachers. Surely they have administration staff that can be reduced in times of budget reductions rather than immediately announce that classroom teachers will be cut from staff. Their mantra seems to be they consider students their first priority. Does not fit with their actions. This really looks like a scare tactic that has worn thin.</p>

      <h3>Albertans are mad about hypocrisy</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Separation should cost Albertans, letter, Nov. 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am not in favour of splitting our province from the rest of Canada , but would rather see Albertans explore the Canadian Pension Plan as well as other options. However it is interesting to read that the writer from Mission City advocates for the federal government to claim rights to a corridor through Alberta, yet Alberta would be denied the same for the Trans Mountain Expansion. It is that type of hypocrisy that gets Albertans knickers in a knot.</p>

      <h3>The hypocrisy of Jason Kenney</h3>
      <p>Jason Kenney’s first budget is both brazenly ideological and incredibly hypocritical. I believe in fiscal prudence, but the predictable mix of cuts to frontline services and tax reductions for corporations goes far beyond prudence; it betrays the callous, privileged ideology of the UCP. The most egregious example is de-indexing AISH. I cannot convey how repugnant and heartless this move is. People receiving AISH cannot work. In a capitalist system, premised on an individual’s ability to contribute narrowly defined economic value, these are the most vulnerable people in our society. AISH is already a pittance; the basic annual amount is $3,293 below the 2017 Canada low income measure (LIM) of poverty. This is where the hypocrisy comes in. Jason Kenney has long opposed de-indexing, or so-called “bracket creep,” and did so in the very pages of this paper. His abandonment of that position to target those most in need is disgusting.</p>
