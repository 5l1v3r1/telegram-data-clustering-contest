      <h3>THE killing on Thursday of Dumaguete radio broadcaster Dindo Generoso is worrisome as it shows the hand of police officers in many media killings in the country, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Arrested yesterday for the killing of Generoso were suspects Teddy Reyes Salaw and retired policeman Glenn Corsame. Another lawman, Police Corporal Roger Rubio, is linked to the murder and remains at large.</p>
      <p>“[T]he fact that two of the alleged killers are policemen is cause enough for worry and reinforces the findings of informal studies by media organizations that tend to indicate the involvement of state security personnel in many journalists’ murders in the country,” the NUJP said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Another example of government security forces’ role in assaults on media is the Maguindanao Massacre, the “deadliest attack on the press in history” which took place in Ampatuan, Maguindanao on November 23, 2009, the NUJP said.</p>
      <p>The NUJP claimed the attack was “plotted and led by government officials and abetted by officers and members of the police and military.” Charged with the gruesome murders of 58 people, including 32 members of the media, are police officers and Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit members.</p>
      <p>The NUJP meanwhile lauded the Negros Oriental police for the “swift” apprehension of the suspects.</p>
      <p>“With the speed with which the Negros Oriental police have acted, we are hoping that Rubio will also be caught         soon and Generoso granted the justice his death deserves,” NUJP said.</p>
      <p>“We... urge them to conduct an honest to goodness investigation into the suspected role of law enforcers and other state security personnel in the murder of journalists,” the media organization added.</p>
