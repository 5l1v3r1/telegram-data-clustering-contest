      <p>Sgt. Jim Warring with the Bartlesville Police Department <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/us/oklahoma-flu-shot-mix-up/index.html">told CNN</a> eight of the patients transported for medical care are residents of Jacquelyn House and two are employees. All 10 are expected to recover, the network reported.</p>
      <p>“I've never seen where there's been some sort of medical misadventure to this magnitude,” Bartlesville Police Chief Tracy Roles said <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/us/oklahoma-flu-shot-mix-up/index.html">during a news conference</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flu-shot-insulin-injection-10-people-disabilities-hospitalized-oklahoma-2019-11-07/">According to CBS News</a>, a veteran pharmacist in practice for 40 years administered the shots and is cooperating fully with authorities.</p>
      <p>“I'm so hopeful that means that this was just a terrible accident. The bigger hope is that all of the patients who are at the hospital make a full recovery,” Roles said.</p>
      <p>Jacquelyn House, owned by <a href="http://abilityworksok.org/">AbilityWorks of Oklahoma Inc.</a>, serves intellectually and developmentally disabled people. The eight residents sickened in the incident represent the Bartlesville site’s full capacity, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/us/oklahoma-flu-shot-mix-up/index.html">CNN reported</a>.<br/> </p>
