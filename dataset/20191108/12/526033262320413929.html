      <p>Myah Autry, 29, made headlines after a video of her appeared to show her standing and dancing in front of a lion at the zoo on Sept. 28.</p>
      <p>It is not clear how she got into the exhibit. Officials described it as a "fenced or otherwise enclosed" area that housed both giraffes and lions.</p>
      <p>The zoo told police there is a moat with an approximately 14-foot drop between where the woman was allegedly standing in the video and the lion.</p>

      <p>Autry, a Brooklyn resident, was arrested Wednesday night after turning herself in, according to the New York Police Department. She was charged with two counts of criminal trespassing.</p>
      <p>Police had asked for the public's help in finding her after the incident.</p>
      <p>Autry did not respond to ABC News for comment.</p>
      <p>Calls to the zoo were not immediately returned Friday.</p>
      <p>In a previous statement, a spokesperson said the action "was a serious violation and unlawful trespass that could have resulted in serious injury or death. Barriers and rules are in place to keep both visitors, staff, and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/animals">animals</a> safe."</p>
      <p>Autry was released on her own recognizance and is due back in court on Dec. 22.</p>
