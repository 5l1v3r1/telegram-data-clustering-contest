      <p>A Hong Kong student who sustained head injuries when he fell during clashes with police died on Friday, triggering a fresh wave of outrage from the pro-democracy movement and fears of more violent unrest.</p>
      <p>Although the precise chain of events leading to 22-year-old Alex Chow’s fall are unclear and disputed, his death is the first student fatality during five months of demonstrations.</p>
      <p>Protesters, who have made alleged police brutality one of their movement’s rallying cries, responded to Chow’s death with tearful vigils on Friday night and calls for fresh rallies over the weekend.</p>
      <p>“Today we mourn the loss of a freedom fighter in Hong Kong,” Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy campaigner, said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“The atmosphere in Hong Kong is like a ticking bomb,” added Lo Kin-hei, a local pro-democracy councillor and activist. “HKers don’t trust the police will give us the truth.”</p>
      <p>Police have repeatedly denied any allegations of wrongdoing in relation to Chow’s death.</p>
      <p>The lead officer in the case, Superintendent Ewing Wu, again insisted on Friday that police were not at fault.</p>
      <p>“As for the allegations that police chased the deceased or that we pushed him and caused him to fall, the police hereby make a solemn statement again that nothing of the kind happened,” Wu told reporters.</p>
      <h3>Disputed events</h3>
      <p>Chow was taken to hospital early on Monday morning following clashes between police and protesters in the middle-class district of Tseung Kwan O.</p>
      <p>He was certified dead by the hospital on Friday morning after failing to emerge from a coma.</p>
      <p>Chow had been found lying unconscious in a pool of blood inside a multi-storey car park that police had fired tear gas towards.</p>
      <p>Protesters had been hurling objects from the building, in the type of confrontation that has become routine in late-night rallies over recent months.</p>
      <p>By Friday evening, the car park had become a makeshift memorial with hundreds lining up to lay flowers, light candles and stick multi-coloured notes carrying messages on the wall.</p>
      <p>“I think there should be an independent inquiry commission to investigate his death and other incidents happened during the movement,” a 23-year-old student, who gave her surname Ho and said she attended Chow’s university, told AFP.</p>
      <p>Police have acknowledged that tear gas had been used Sunday night to disperse protesters near the car park where Chow fell.</p>
      <p>Wu, the lead investigator, confirmed on Friday that police entered the car park twice to contain the protesters but said that officers were not inside when Chow fell.</p>
      <p>Wu and a police spokeswoman also rejected accusations that officers delayed paramedics getting to the scene.</p>
      <p>“At this stage, we are investigating the cause of Chow’s death instead of investigating police officers,” Wu said.</p>
      <p>The Hong Kong government expressed “great sorrow and regret” on Friday over Chow passing away.</p>
      <p>In Beijing, foreign affairs ministry Geng Shuang declined to comment directly when asked about Chow’s death.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t a diplomatic question so I suggest you ask the relevant government department. I will just say this: stopping the violence, eliminating disorder, and restoring order is Hong Kong’s most urgent task,” Geng told reporters.</p>
      <h3>Grief, anger</h3>
      <p>Chow was a student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p>
      <p>The college held its graduation ceremony Friday morning, and university head Wei Shyy paused the proceedings to announce Chow’s death.</p>
      <p>After the ceremony was cut short, hundreds of students gathered to mourn Chow’s passing and condemn what they described as police brutality.</p>
      <p>“Hindering rescuers is attempted murder!” Student chanted as they marched at the campus.</p>
      <p>Shyy later released a statement to students backing calls for an independent inquiry.</p>
      <p>“We will be outraged if there is no acceptable explanation offered to us,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Millions of people have taken to Hong Kong’s streets since June in the greatest challenge to China’s rule of the city since its handover from the British in 1997.</p>
      <p>China governs Hong Kong under a special “one country, two systems” framework that is meant to give the city more freedoms and liberties than on the mainland.</p>
      <p>But public anger has been building for years over a belief that Beijing is eroding those freedoms, especially since President Xi Jinping came to power.</p>
      <p>The protests were triggered by a government effort to introduce a law allowing extraditions of criminal suspects to mainland China.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s government belatedly withdrew the plan but not before the protest movement escalated into wider calls for democracy.</p>
      <p>Protesters are demanding fully free elections to choose the city’s leader, as well as an investigation into alleged abuses by police.</p>
