      <h1>The reason why Gary Sawyer is excited by Plymouth Argyle's FA Cup tie at Bolton Wanderers</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims' skipper has relived some of the FA Cup highlights of his 15-year career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:15:33+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Skipper Gary Sawyer has revealed the special reason why he is looking forward to playing for Plymouth Argyle in their away FA Cup first round tie against Bolton Wanderers tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old defender has never played at the 28,000-seat capacity University of Bolton Stadium before.</p>
      <p>However, Sawyer did get the chance to have a good look around the venue while he was on loan to Exeter City early in his career.</p>
      <p>It was when Exeter, then in Football Conference, were drawn away to mighty Manchester United in the FA Cup third round in January.</p>
      <p>Sawyer, then aged 19, and the rest of the City squad stayed overnight at the Whites Hotel, which is part of the University of Bolton Stadium, before playing at Old Trafford the next day.</p>
      <p>Exeter went on to achieve a famous 0-0 draw before losing 2-0 to United a replay at St James Park.</p>
      <p>Sawyer said: “Bolton is a huge club and it’s a great stadium. I haven’t played at that ground before.</p>
      <p>“That’s where we stayed when I played the Man United game. Me and a lad that used to be here, Marcus Martin, we roomed together.</p>
      <p>“I remember walking around it (the University of Bolton Stadium), knowing you are playing United the next day, and just thinking ‘This is amazing, I would love to play here’.</p>
      <p>“I have never had a chance since, and now the FA Cup has brought me that.”</p>
      <p>Exeter held out for a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford, even after Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes were introduced as second half substitutes.</p>
      <p>Then, in the replay, goals from Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney saw United finally get the better of City.</p>

      <p>Sawyer said: “Everyone always asks me about Man United. It happened so many years ago but it has obviously stayed with me.</p>
      <p>“It was a great experience at the time, to be that young, to go and do that. It’s what every kid dreams of, I suppose, to go to Old Trafford and play.</p>
      <p>“To do it that early in my career was great. It’s just a shame I have never been back since unfortunately.”</p>
      <p>He added: “We were a non-League team at the time and United were the top of the top in England.</p>
      <p>“It was just an amazing experience and one that you sort of have to pinch yourself, even now, and think ‘Did that really happen?’</p>
      <p>“It brought such a love for the cup for me, personally, to do it so early in my career. I have got great fond memories in the FA Cup.”</p>
      <p>His FA Cup highlight as an Argyle player came in 2006/07 when the Pilgrims – then in the Championship - reached the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>Victories over Peterborough United (after a replay at Home Park), Barnet and Derby County led to Argyle reaching the last eight.</p>
      <p>They were drawn at home to Premier League opposition in the shape of Watford.</p>
      <p>Argyle gave a very good account of themselves but still lost 1-0, with goalkeeper Ben Foster the visitors’ man-of-the-match after making some crucial saves.</p>
      <p>Sawyer said: “It was a great game for us and one we felt we could get through really.</p>
      <p>“Watford were a Premier League team at the time but we had a great run that year. We had a good side.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “I remember coming off the pitch after the game and being proud that we had got that far in such a great competition, but gutted we didn’t get that extra step forward from there.”</p>
      <p>Sawyer left Argyle in 2010 but was brought back to the club five years later by Derek Adams.</p>
      <p>The League Two Pilgrims reached the FA Cup third round in 2016/17 after beating Mansfield Town and Newport County (after a replay at Rodney Parade).</p>
      <p>Their reward was being drawn against Liverpool at Anfield and, incredibly, they drew 0-0.</p>
      <p>That led to a replay at a packed Home Park, which was televised around the world, which Liverpool narrowly won 1-0.</p>
      <p>Sawyer did not play a part in either game, though, after his season up until that point had been badly disrupted by injury.</p>
      <p>He was not in the squad at all at Anfield but was an unused substitute for the replay, with Ben Purrington playing at left-back both times.</p>
      <p>Sawyer said: “I had a serious year that year. Touch wood, I haven’t had many in my career.</p>
      <p>“That was one that ruled me out for quite a while, but to see some of the young lads get a chance to go to Anfield and play was amazing.</p>
      <p>“It was a shame for me, it’s somewhere that I have never played and would have love to have been involved.</p>
      <p>“I managed to get myself fit enough to be on the bench for the home game.</p>
      <p>“Being involved against a club like that, you can only get that in the FA Cup if you don’t play in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“It’s an amazing competition and that’s why everyone buys into it.”</p>
      <p>Bolton are four-times winners of the FA Cup and have been beaten in the final on three other occasions so they have a lot of history in the competition.</p>
      <p>Sawyer said: “They are a league above us so probably the pressure goes onto them more so than us.</p>
      <p>“But it’s a game we want to do well in. We want to progress through the cup so we take it seriously as any league game.</p>

      <p>“You keep marching forward and hopefully we can get the result we want on Saturday.”</p>
      <p>One of the players standing in their way is former Argyle goalkeeper Remi Matthews, who had a successful loan spell with the Pilgrims from Norwich City in 2017/18.</p>
      <p>Matthews has been a regular between the posts for Bolton this season.</p>
      <p>Sawyer said: “Remi was great for us, and a great lad as well off the pitch. He’s a fantastic ‘keeper and he will do well for them, as he did for us.”</p>
