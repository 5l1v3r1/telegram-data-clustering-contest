      <p>A Kenyan woman whose identity is yet to be revealed was busted with cocaine at the Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
      <p>Thai officials said that the woman swallowed more than one kilogram of cocaine to avoid detection. She was however subjected to a x-ray.</p>
      <p>”An x-ray showed she had swallowed 1.2kg of cocaine in a bid to avoid detection,” Niyom Termsrisuk, a Thai official said.</p>

      <p>She was apprehended following a joint operation by the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) and the Air Interdiction Task Force (AITF).</p>
      <p>Reports also indicate that she arrived in Bangkok from Angola.</p>
      <p>In August, a Kenyan national Glenn Chibasellow Ookow was arrested at the same airport after he was found in possession of 68 cocaine capsules.</p>

      <p>He too had swallowed the capsules. Ookow was arrested alongside a Nigerian national, Osita Joseph Ukpa, who authorities say had allegedly hired the Kenyan to bring in drugs to Thailand and other countries in the region.</p>
      <p>According to international media reports, Thailand has long been a major drug smuggling hub, with its porous borders and lax law enforcement making it easier for transnational crime networks to transport their goods.</p>
