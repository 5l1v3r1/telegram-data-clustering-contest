      <p>The Premier Soccer League confirmed the latest MultiChoice Diski Challenge goalscoring charts with young Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs talents chasing the number one spot, which is currently occupied by a Bidvest Wits player.</p>
      <p>Chiefs and Pirates have made it one of their objectives to promote talent from their youth structures at least every season, with the likes of Thabiso Monyane and Njabulo Blom already impressing in the first teams.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However, the future already looks promising for some players in the MDC, as they have been making quite the name for themselves in front of goal. </p>
      <p>Leading the goalscoring charts is Rowan Human from Bidvest Wits, who has scored 10 goals in the MDC after 13 games played so far, with his side currently sitting in second place on the log.</p>
      <p>Second on the goalscoring charts is Teboho Motloung from Bloemfontein Celtic, who has tallied eight goals so far, despite his side currently at 11<sup>th</sup> place on the MDC log.</p>
      <p>In third place and chasing the top two on the charts, Pirates’ Sifiso Luthuli and Chiefs’ Sibusiso Milazi and Lebohang Lesako have scored seven goals each, while the Soweto sides are currently sitting in fourth and seventh place respectively. </p>
      <p>Also on seven goals each is AmaZulu FC’s Bayanda Shangase, Stellenbosch FC’s Tristan Hanslo, Wits’ Molahlehi Khunyedi and Chippa United’s Diego Appollis.</p>
      <p>With 17 matches left to play in the MDC, it is possible that these youngsters could likely double their figures and it remains to be seen whether a first team promotion could be on the cards in the near future.</p>
      <p>
