      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:06:54+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Phillips, https://www.facebook.com/JournoTom/</a></address>
      <p>All eyes will be focused on what happens in Merseyside this weekend as <a href="https://www.thepools.com/Liverpool-City?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_liverpool-city">Liverpool host Man City</a> .</p>
      <p>As Anfield is expected to be bouncing more than usual on Sunday, many have tipped this to be a pivotal moment in the title race.</p>
      <p>It looks set to be a high-tempo and energetic match with so many key battles to look out for:</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola vs Jurgen Klopp</p>
      <p>Jordan Henderson vs David Silva</p>
      <p>Kevin De Bruyne vs Trent Alexander-Arnold</p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah vs Benjamin Mendy</p>
      <p>Sergio Aguero vs Virgil van Dijk</p>
      <p>And the world's oldest football betting outlet is getting involved by offering a <a href="https://www.thepools.com/Liverpool-City?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_liverpool-city">free £5 bet</a> for this weekend's heavyweight clash.</p>
      <p>There are no strings attached, simply sign up and away you go!</p>
      <p>It looks set to be a hot contest once again with both sides looking to go with an attacking intent.</p>
      <p>In fact, in their last 20 meetings in all competitions there has only been one 0-0 draw and another four clean sheets so this game promises goals!</p>
      <p>Both Liverpool and Man City are <a href="https://www.thepools.com/Liverpool-City?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_liverpool-city">13/8</a> to win this match while a draw is <a href="https://www.thepools.com/Liverpool-City?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_liverpool-city">12/5</a> .</p>
      <p>Liverpool's front three of Salah, Mane and Firmino will be making the most out of City's weak defence while Aguero and Sterling will be looking to frustrate van Dijk and Alisson.</p>
      <p>Salah is 9/2 first goal and Mane 5/1, while if City are going to strike first Aguero is 9/2.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Raheem Sterling is 11/2 to score his first Anfield goal since he was a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> player.</p>
