      <p>Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day is allowing you to save big on NOMA Christmas trees today. Some are as much as 40-percent off of their regular price. There are trees that are small table-top trees, ranging all the way up to seven-foot tall trees. These are also all pre-lit trees, so you don't have to worry about stringing the lights yourself.</p>
      <p>If you've got someone on your shopping list this year that collects Funko POP! figures, then this Gold Box Deal is for you. Today only, you can save up to 30-percent on Funko POP! figures. There's all kinds of figures included here, including Venom, which has been a best seller, surprisingly.</p>
      <p>Some Samsung TVs are currently at their lowest prices of the year on Amazon. These are not QLED TVs, but rather LED TVs, that are still at some incredible prices. And if you think that these prices will be lower on Black Friday, you're wrong. TVs are always discounted more before Black Friday than on Black Friday. It's usually the already cheap, and not that great, TVs that are discounted heavily on Black Friday – in doorbuster deals.</p>

      <p>Amazon is discounting a number of Nikon cameras and lenses right now, in its "Happy HoliDeals" event. Allowing you to save big on some great cameras on lenses. Including the Nikon D750 which is up to 15-percent off right now. There are some really good lenses on sale, like the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens, that is just $176 today – that's the same price as a used one!</p>
      <p>These deals are all available until midnight PST on the expiration date specified below. These prices are also as up-to-date as possible, but beware that prices will fluctuate throughout the day.
