      <h1>These are the earliest possible release dates for Boy A and Boy B</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:52:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Central Criminal Court has heard the earliest possible release date for Boy A and Boy B following the Ana Kriegel murder trial.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Boy A received a life sentence for murdering the 14-year-old schoolgirl, while Boy B was sentenced to 15 years detention.</p>
      <p>The earliest possible release date for Boy A is June 18, 2031, while for Boy B it is June 18, 2027.</p>
      <p>The Judge has today ordered that a series of progress reports on both boys be carried out every two years during their periods of detention.</p>
      <p>He said that the court needs to be fully informed of efforts made by the boys towards rehabilitation when their respective review dates arrive.</p>
      <p>The reports will include updates on their educational, psychological, and psychiatric progress.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Paul McDermott said the furnishing of reports is not for micromanaging the boys' sentences, but for courts to have a clear view of what happens during the course of their detention.</p>
      <p>Both boys will be transferred to adult prisons when they turn 18 in 2022.</p>
