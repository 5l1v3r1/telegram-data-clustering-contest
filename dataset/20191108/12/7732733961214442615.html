      <h1>OpenAI publishes text-generation tool that can write believable fake news</h1>
      <h2>OpenAI says no one has misused the limited versions so far</h2>

      <h4>Something to look forward to: While OpenAI withheld the full public release of its GPT-2 AI for fear that it might fall into the wrong hands, the organization is now hopeful that it might actually help researchers develop tools to combat online misinformation and spam.</h4>
      <p>Back in February, OpenAI <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/78766-openai-has-text-generation-tool-can-write-convincing.html">revealed</a> an artificial intelligence dubbed GPT-2 that's capable of writing convincing fake news using snippets as a starting point. The organization saw the high potential for misuse, so it decided to do a staged release that allowed limited use by researchers.</p>
      <p>The scaled back versions haven't been misused in the wild, so OpenAI has now <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/">released</a> the full model of GPT-2 that contains 1.5 billion parameters, hoping it will help researchers improve text detection and generation tools. With more fine-tuning, it could soon help experts determine whether a malicious actor is generating spam and misinformation or impersonating someone online. It may also serve to improve chatbots to do more than just <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/77583-lenny-chatbot-trolls-telemarketers.html">troll telemarketers</a>.</p>
      <p>GPT-2 has been trained to predict the next words in text taken from 8 million web pages. But while the quality of its output is impressive, human-perceived credibility is still relatively low. The text it generates isn't always coherent and can include repetitive structures, sudden topic-switching, and world modeling failures. An example might be that GPT-2 can write about fires happening under water or someone being their father's father.</p>
      <p>Simply put, the more data it has, the higher the quality of its output. On the other hand, GPT-2 fails spectacularly when it comes to very specific or esoteric content. Then again, OpenAI's technology has been surpassed by Google's <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html">BERT</a>, which is used to predict what people are searching for online using the power of its cloud infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81067-microsoft-pour-1b-openai-part-multiyear-partnership.html">poured $1 billion into OpenAI</a> to fuel its ambitions to create an "artificial general intelligence." In the meantime, you can play with the web version of the much more limited GPT-2 <a href="http://talktotransformer.com/">here</a>.</p>
