      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) â€“ Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting on Friday said that Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman should not take revenge from the masses by causing them mental agony for rejecting him during general elections.</p>
      <p>The special assistant took to the twitter and urged Chief of JUI (F) Maulana Fazlur Rehman to uphold democratic and constitutional norms.</p>
      <p>Dr Firdous asked Maulana Fazlur Rehman to shun intransigence and have mercy on his workers facing severe weather conditions.</p>
      <p>She said dialogue is part of democratic process of which Maulana Fazlur Rehman has been the firm supporter. She further questioned as to why Maulana wants to keep the windows of his mind shut by declaring the talks meaningless.</p>
      <p>The special assistant said making hue and cry over the election rigging after one year is nothing but to hoodwink the masses and weaken the democratic system.</p>
      <p>She said if the elections were rigged then why did Maulana Fazlur Rehman contest the presidential elections and his son took oath as member of National Assembly?</p>
