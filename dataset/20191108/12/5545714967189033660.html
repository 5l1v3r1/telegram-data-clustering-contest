      <h1>Monster Hunter's Resident Evil quest is worth it for Tofu alone</h1>
      <h2>Become zombified in the event quest 'Return of the Bioweapon'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Devore</a></address>
      <p><i>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne </i>and <i>Resident Evil 2 </i>have entered an unholy union, and I'm extremely here for it. It's a gift. The limited-time in-game event runs until December 5, 2019 for Master Rank players who are MR20 or higher and can hold their own against an extra-nasty <a href="https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Blackveil+Vaal+Hazak">Blackveil Vaal Hazak</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with a zombie-themed event quest and a chance to dress up like Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, <i>Iceborne </i>players can also spruce up their rooms with a classic typewriter and item box.</p>
      <p>Heck, you can even throw on soothing <i>Resident Evil</i> Save Room music.</p>

      <p>First things first, though: that event quest. It's called <b>RE: Return of the Bioweapon</b>. Your initial instinct might be to bulk up on <a href="https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Effluvial+Buildup">effluvia</a> countermeasures but, as the intro screen warns, there's a twist.</p>
      <p>"In this quest, instead of being afflicted with effluvium, you'll become zombified if you're hit by an effluvium-based attack. This also means that effluvium-resistant skills are neglected."</p>
      <p>Zombification has pros and cons. In this state, you won't react to damage, your health will auto-recover in areas with effluvium, and you'll be immune to acid pools. That's all well and good. But while you're a zombie, you'll also shamble around, lose the dodge/evade ability, and most items can't be used.</p>
      <p>To un-zombify yourself, you'll want to use Green Herbs – not to be confused with the normal green-<i>colored</i> herbs – which have sprung up throughout Rotten Vale. In a nice little extra nod, you can scrounge for Red Herbs and combine them with Green Herbs for a more potent recovery item.</p>
      <p>The fight against Blackveil Vaal Hazak is otherwise business as usual. In other words: don't be afraid to leap. I'd advise bringing a Cleanser Booster along to make life easy when he starts getting spammy.</p>

      <p>In exchange for beating Return of the Bioweapon, you'll earn a new type of crafting item, the S.T.A.R.S. Badge, which you can use to make the fancy new <i>Resident Evil 2</i>-themed gear.</p>
      <p>Be sure to chat up the Housekeeper back in Seliana afterward. You'll get two zombie gestures and a pair of delivery quests: Type to Save Your Life and Good Ol' Item Box. You can then turn these quests in at the Resource Center – they require one S.T.A.R.S. Badge each – to get a typewriter and item box for your room. You should! There are home decorations like blood-soaked rugs and a Mr. Raccoon doll, too.</p>
      <p>If you're into pendants (who isn't?), you can spend your S.T.A.R.S. Badges to craft pendants that resemble the R.P.D. badge, the Umbrella logo, and Tofu. It wiggles. I mean it really, truly <i>wiggles</i>. I love it!</p>
      <p>Lastly, the crossover includes <i>Resident Evil 2 </i>armor sets. They're a bit too uncanny for me, but if you appreciate the novelty, here's what you'll need to craft the Leon and Claire outfits in <i>Iceborne</i>:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leon α+</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>S.T.A.R.S. Badge (x6)</li>
        <li>Pure Dragon Blood (x3)</li>
        <li>Shadowpierce Fang (x2)</li>
        <li>Deathweaver Membrane (x2)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Claire α+</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>S.T.A.R.S. Badge (x6)</li>
        <li>Pure Dragon Blood (x3)</li>
        <li>Vaal Hazak Fellwing (x2)</li>
        <li>Deathweaver Membrane (x2)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The unsettling <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA07713_00-MHWIRECEPT0000RE">Mr. X costume for the handler</a> is a paid add-on. Its usage should be outlawed.</p>
