      <p>Vertigo Theatre’s Sherlock Holmes and the Raven’s Curse is reuniting Curt McKinstry with some special friends.</p>
      <p>Two years ago in Vertigo Theatre’s Sherlock Holmes and the American Problem by actor and playwright R. Hamilton Wright, McKinstry played Dr. Watson to Braden Griffiths’ Sherlock under the watchful eye of Sherlock’s landlady Mrs. Hudson played by Kathryn Kerbes. The trio is back for more sleuthing in the newest Sherlock adventure from Wright which runs at Vertigo Nov. 9 to Dec. 14.</p>
      <p>It was originally scheduled to close on Dec. 7 but the demand for tickets was so great it had to be held over.</p>
      <p>Vertigo’s production under the direction of Jenna Rogers will be the world premiere of The Raven’s Curse which Vertigo’s artistic director Craig Hall will direct for the Shaw Festival in the summer of 2020.</p>
      <p>There’s no denying Holmes and Watson are fan favourites at Vertigo.</p>
      <p>“Arthur Conan Doyle is like Agatha Christie. They write mysteries which are not only fun and intriguing but great literature as well. Their mysteries have universal appeal and they are timeless,” says McKinstry.</p>
      <p>“The story of the Raven’s Curse comes late in the book series. It begins six months after the death of Watson’s wife Mary.</p>
      <p>“Sherlock has not seen Watson since the funeral and Watson is dealing with extreme grief. One day in the street Watson is confronted by an Asian woman who hands him a nail and tells him to bring it to Sherlock because he’ll know what it means.</p>
      <p>“Watson has no intention of going on this adventure but Sherlock needs him to go undercover as Sherlock’s valet because the nail brings Sherlock back to his childhood home,” explains McKinstry who adds that Sherlock’s favourite uncle has died and Sherlock suspects foul play.</p>
      <p>One of the things McKinstry likes most about Watson is the man’s loyalty.</p>
      <p>“Watson is a true and selfless friend. He has such admirably gentle qualities. He’s the true Victorian gentleman. Sherlock, on the other hand, is the rebellious eccentric. Watson considers it his duty to keep Sherlock in line with what is socially acceptable and that’s not an easy task.”</p>
      <p>McKinstry understands Watson’s fascination with Sherlock’s mental prowess.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always been fascinated with people who are quick witted and intuitive. Watson feels Sherlock’s deductive powers make him seem almost otherworldly and I think that is part of the character’s appeal for audiences as well. We all love to hear how Sherlock arrives at his amazing conclusions.”</p>
      <p>Watson is often called Sherlock’s sidekick but McKinstry says that is not as much the case in The Raven’s Curse as it was in The American Problem.</p>
      <p>“We see much more of the human side of Watson in this story — firstly, because of how he is dealing with his grief — but also with how he interacts with Sherlock’s family members to help Sherlock solve the mystery of the curse that has plagued his family.”</p>
      <p>McKinstry admits, as an actor, he’s fortunate to be playing Watson.</p>
      <p>“Watson is such an iconic character. It’s a treat to play him and a coup few actors ever get. It also helps that I have such a fondness for him. I like him. I’d like to be his friend and I understand why Sherlock likes him so much.”</p>
      <p>Joining McKinstry, Griffiths and Kerbes in Sherlock Holmes and the Raven’s Curse is Garett Ross as Sherlock’s brother Mycroft with Katherine Fadum, Rong Fu, Kristen Padayas and Mike Tan filling out the cast.</p>
      <p>Tickets, which start as low as $29, can be reserved at 403-221-3708 or online at vertigotheatre.com.</p>
