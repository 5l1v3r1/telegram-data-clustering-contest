      <p>DUBLIN: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/William-Porterfield">William Porterfield</a> has stepped down as Ireland's Test and one-day captain after more than 11 years at the helm with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Andrew-Balbirnie">Andrew Balbirnie</a> succeeding him, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cricket-Ireland">Cricket Ireland</a> said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Since taking over from former skipper Trent Johnston in 2008, Porterfield has led the senior team 253 times, including when Ireland debuted as a Test nation in May last year.</p>
      <p>"It has been an incredible journey, and a fantastic honour to have captained my country over the past 11 and a half years," Porterfield said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"To have been able to lead Ireland out at various World Cups, through to our first Test against Pakistan, and again at Lordâ€™s in the summer, have been but a few of these highlights."</p>
      <p>Middle-order batsman Balbirnie will begin his tenure in January with a one-day series in West Indies.</p>
