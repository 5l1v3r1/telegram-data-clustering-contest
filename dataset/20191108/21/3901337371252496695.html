      <p>The record 20-time league champions have endured a decline in fortunes following the retirement of legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013, and current boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is facing pressure to turn things around.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer, who spent 11 successful years as a player at Old Trafford, returned to the club last season to replace Jose Mourinho in the hot seat, but has failed to get his side moving up the table, a problem he now hopes to rectify in the transfer market.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Evening Standard,</i> the 46-year-old will look to bring in seven new faces as he looks to rebuild his squad into a side that can challenge for Premier League glory.</p>

      <p>United's attack and midfield are the areas he will reportedly look to strengthen, and the likes of Emre Can of Juventus, Everton's Richarlison, Red Bull Salzburg's Erling Haaland and Olympique Lyon's Moussa Dembele have all been identified as targets.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have also been linked with Bianconeri forward Mario Mandzukic, Leicester City's James Maddison and Borussia Dortmund wonderkid Jadon Sancho, the latter of whom is said to be Solskjaer's "dream signing".</p>
