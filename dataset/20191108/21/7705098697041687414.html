      <h1>Showtime’s Halo TV Series Finally Begins Shooting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T21:00:42+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>It’s been a very long time since <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/418163-showtime-orders-halo-tv-series">Showtime announced</a> it was producing a <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/halo"><b>Halo</b></a> TV series, based on Microsoft’s hit video game franchise. But it looks like the network is finally ready to begin filming.</p>
      <p>A new post appeared on Instagram, announcing that “Production on the Showtime @Halo series is about to begin!” </p>

      <p><b>Halo</b> will film in Budapest, Hungary, with Kyle Killen and Steven Kane serving as co-showrunners and executive producers.</p>
      <p>Pablo Schreiber, who previously appeared in <b>Orange Is the New Black</b>, will <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/444627-pablo-schreiber-is-master-chief-on-showtimes-halo-series">portray Master Chief</a>. The cast also includes Natascha McElhone, Bokeem Woodbine, Shabana Amzi, Bentley Kalu, Natasha Culzac and Kate Kennedy. McElhone will actually serve double duty for the series. She’ll play Dr. Catherine Halsey as well as Master Chief’s AI assistant, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/461061-natascha-mcelhone-is-cortana-on-showtimes-halo-tv-series">Cortana</a>.</p>

      <p>Although <b>Halo</b> will offer some new characters and a fresh arc on the franchise, it will adhere to the canon of the games. Showtime President of Entertainment Gary Levine <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/461241-showtimes-halo-series-is-all-canon-will-aim-for-almost-r-rating">confirmed this</a> back in August.</p>
      <p>“Our challenge on this series was to take a video game and to make it into a character drama that belongs on Showtime. I’m happy to say on paper we’ve accomplished that and now we’re looking forward to accomplishing that on the screen,” he explained at the time. He also noted that the series would go for an “almost R” rating.</p>
      <p>However, it may still be a bit of a wait for Master Chief’s television arrival. Showtime hasn’t set a premiere date for <b>Halo</b>. </p>
