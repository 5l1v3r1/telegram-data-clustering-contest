      <h1>'Amy knew she was on a mic': Former ABC producer claims Robach knew Epstein rant was recorded</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T21:00:23+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Brest Â &amp; Ellie Bufkin</a></address>
      <p>Former ABC producer Ashley Bianco denied that she leaked a video of anchor Amy Robach complaining that the network spiked her Jeffrey Epstein scoop in a shocking clip that has been circulating for a week.</p>
      <p>In a tearful interview with Megyn Kelly, Bianco flatly denied that she was responsible for leaking the clip to Project Veritas,<i> </i>who <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-had-it-all-abc-host-claims-network-squashed-epstein-story-three-years-ago-in-leaked-video">shared</a> the footage across social media this week. Kelly questioned whether Bianco was producing from the control room when Robach ranted about the loss of her Epstein scoop.</p>
      <p>"I was watching the comments while I was at my desk," Bianco said. "I went to my manager and said, 'Do you see what she's saying? Does she know she's on a hot mic?'" Bianco then claims she was told that Robach knew her remarks could be heard, not only by employees in the studio but by anyone with access to the broadcast. "The assistant said to us that Amy knew she was on a mic and that she knew she was being broadcast to all the affiliates."</p>
      <p>When asked whether Bianco realized the weight of what she was hearing, the 25-year-old responded, "Everyone in the office was freaked out by what she was saying."</p>
      <p>Bianco again denied sharing the clip with anyone and claimed her job as a producer was primarily to create reels for on-air talent and share "funny" clips with other employees. "It was just for office gossip," she said of clipping the segment.</p>
      <p>She asserted that she has never been acquainted with Project Veritas or its founder James O'Keefe, saying, "I'd never even heard of Project Veritas<i>.</i>"</p>
      <p>O'Keefe also denies that Bianco was responsible for leaking the footage. When Kelly pressed Bianco to guess who might be responsible for giving the tape to O'Keefe, she said that it could have been anyone. "Everyone saw it," she said.</p>
