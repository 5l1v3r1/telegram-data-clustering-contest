      <blockquote>"The Council today agreed to remove Belize from the EU's list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions. Belize has passed the necessary reforms to improve its tax regime for international business companies that was due to be implemented by end 2018", the statement said.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the council, Belize was moved from the blacklist to a grey list, and to be white-listed, the country's authorities should address the issue of its foreign source income exemption regime.</p>
      <blockquote>"Belize will, therefore, be moved from annexe I of the conclusions to annex II, pending the i<a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201801081060581529-belize-bans-offshore-oil-drilling/">mplementation of the country's commitment</a> to amend or abolish the harmful features of its foreign source income exemption regime by end 2019", the statement pointed out.</blockquote>
