      <p>Shane Lowry knows he must continue to knock down pins this weekend after he fired a seven-under 65 to get to within five shots of the lead on the Turkish Airlines Open.</p>
      <p>Having struggled on the greens to shoot an opening 72 at The Montgomerie Maxx Royal, the Open champion hit the ball so well yesterday that he birdied all five par-fives in an eight-birdie round and moved up 27 places to tied 25th, just five strokes behind Austria’s Matthias Schwab on seven-under par.</p>
      <p>“I can’t remember the last time I shot a 65 and was disappointed with myself,” Lowry said after a ball-striking clinic that saw him miss two eagle putts but erase a lone bogey with eight birdies.</p>
      <p>“I played lovely. I had two very good eagle chances, missed those, and made birdies on the others as well. It was one of those days where I got the number and only had eyes for the flag. I felt good out there today.</p>
      <p>“It is perfect weather for golf, it is pretty easy out there and the scoring shows you that. I will need another one or two of those if I am to contend the next few days.”</p>
      <p>After his putting struggles on Thursday, he left himself a 25 footer for par at his opening hole but rolled it home and celebrated á la Miguel Angel Jiménez by sheathing his putter like a sword.</p>
      <p>“That was a good start to the round,” Lowry said. “You sometimes forget about stuff like that but it was nice to roll that in and I kicked on from there afterwards. I felt like I was hitting the fairways, hitting my targets with my second shots. When I had a good number I was able to get straight at the flag. It was one of those days. It was nice.”</p>
      <p>Having complained about the greens on the first day, Lowry admitted it was a question of trust and he had more yesterday and took advantage of some excellent play from tee to green.</p>
      <p>He might have shot eight or nine-under with ease but he was pleased to make a positive move up the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>After getting up and down for birdie at the par-five 11th, he hit an eight iron to eight feet at 12th, then got up and down from the front bunker at the par-five 13th to move swiftly to three under, Chances slipped by at the 14th, 15th and 16th and while he was annoyed to clip a tree and bogey the 17th attempting a recovery from the trees, he quickly made amends with some sensational iron play.</p>
      <p>He might have eagled both the 18th and the first after a 240-yard three-iron to 20 feet and a 267-yard five wood to eight feet. But while he missed both putts, he was now four-under and motoring, Another stunning three-iron to the heart of the fourth set up a two-putt birdie and after watching playing partner Pablo Larrazábal hole a five-iron from 219 yards for a hole-in-one at the fifth, he hit an eight iron stiff at the sixth and rolled in a 15 footer at the seventh before narrowly missing from eight feet for a 64 at the ninth.</p>
      <p>Lowry might be just five shots off the lead but he knows he may need two more 65s to contend after Schwab (24) followed his opening 65 with a 67 to lead by one stroke on 12-under par from Danny Willett, Ross Fisher, Thomas Detry and Alex Noren.</p>
      <p>Defending champion Justin Rose is lurking alongside the likes of Scottish rookie Robert MacIntyre (63) on 10-under after a second successive 67 kept his hopes of a third successive Turkish Airlines Open win alive.</p>
      <p>Pádraig Harrington also had a good day on the course, closing with a birdie at the ninth for a bogey-free, six-under 66 that left him 45th on three-under.</p>
      <p>“I am happy with my score and the way I played but to be honest, if I had of shot five-under I would have been very disappointed,” Harrington said. “So to birdie the last makes it a bit more palatable.”</p>
      <p>At the Challenge Tour Grand Final in Mallorca, Cormac Sharvin had a second round 71 to lie on two-over-par overall in a tie for 16th place. Francesco Laporta leads on five under par.</p>
