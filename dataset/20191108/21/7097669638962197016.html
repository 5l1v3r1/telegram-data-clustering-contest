      <p>SAO PAULO (AP) — The Latest on Brazilian former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (all times local):</p>

      <p>Former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has left the jail where he had been detained since April 2018.</p>
      <p>Da Silva embraced his girlfriend Friday as he came out of the federal police building in Curitiba.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of people gathered outside the building cheered and applauded the former leader.</p>
      <p>A Brazilian judge ordered his release early Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that a person can be imprisoned only after all appeals to higher courts have been exhausted.</p>
      <p>Da Silva is still appealing the case that put him behind bars, related to the alleged purchase of a beachfront apartment in Sao Paulo state.</p>
      <p>Da Silva, who governed from 2003 to 2010, had been favored to win the 2018 presidential election, but his conviction prohibited him from running.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>1:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Brazil's Supreme Court delivered a ruling that could release almost 5,000 inmates still appealing their convictions, including former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and other powerful figures jailed in a sprawling corruption investigation.</p>
      <p>The court decided in a 6-5 vote late Thursday that a person can be imprisoned only after all appeals to higher courts have been exhausted.</p>
      <p>The decision appears to cover Da Silva, whose attorneys said they will request his release Friday. That move will initially depend on a judge based in the southern city of Curitiba, where the former president is jailed.</p>
      <p>The ruling also covers others convicted in cases arising from the so-called Car Wash investigation, which has ensnared dozens of top politicians and business leaders in Latin America's largest nation. They will now be able to seek release.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors from the Car Wash probe said in a statement the top court's decision "goes against the sentiment of repudiating impunity and the fight against corruption."</p>
      <p>Supporters of Da Silva celebrated the ruling, holding up signs saying "Lula," the name by which the president who governed from 2003 to 2010 is universally known here.</p>
