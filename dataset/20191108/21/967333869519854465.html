        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Remember the epic Harry Potter make-believe Quidditch tournaments. Well, it seems that Indian cops in Uttar Pradesh state have derived some inspiration from the wizards of Potter's world.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The wizarding sport, Quidditch, is played by mounting on broomsticks in the magical Hogwarts series.</p>
      <p>Similar scenes were witnessed during an <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910141077042827-india-imposes-restrictions-on-legendary-city-of-ayodhya-ahead-of-key-court-verdict/">anti-riot drill</a> by police, who were seen running with batons between their legs in the Firozabad district of India’s Uttar Pradesh state.  </p>
      <p>According to a Twitter post, the one of a kind drill was carried out due to the unavailability of actual horses. Therefore, it appears that the decision to use batons instead of horses was taken by the authorities.</p>

      <p>​The mock-drill was conducted ahead of the crucial <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911081077252680-chief-justice-of-india-calls-top-officials-in-uttar-pradesh-ahead-of-key-verdict-in-ayodhya-case/">Ayodhya land dispute</a> verdict, due to be announced by the court around 17 November.</p>
      <p>India’s  Home Ministry has deployed 4,000 troops in Ayodhya ahead of court’s judgement on the several decades' old contentious dispute over a piece of land claimed by both Hindu and Muslim organisations.</p>
      <p>The video also refreshed the memories of netizens of an earlier incident in which an Uttar Pradesh Police officer imitated the sound of a gun, saying “thaye- thaye”, to scare off a criminal, after his gun jammed during an encounter.</p>
