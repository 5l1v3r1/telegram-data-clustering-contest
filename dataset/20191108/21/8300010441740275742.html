      <p>Matt Jacovelli, 80, loves feeding animals in his Deptford Township, New Jersey backyard. Every day, he spreads kernels of corn and watches from his porch as critters feast.<br/><br/>Given all the kernels, he's pretty used to pulling weeds, but one kept growing - and it was something of a mystery.<br/><br/><br/>"I'm not a farmer. It's just this freak accident here is giving us a lot of attention," said Jacovelli.<br/><br/>What he thinks happened is a squirrel took one of the kernels from his yard and buried it in his garden.<br/><br/>"We joked around and said, 'OK, let's let it grow,'" said Jacovelli.<br/><br/>After a while, he started to notice something unusual. There were several cobs growing from the same stalk.<br/><br/><br/>"We started counting them and I think we got to 20. I said this is unbelievable! We may have this record," Jacovelli said.<br/><br/>To be exact, there are 29 cobs of corn on the single stalk. It's now the Guinness World Record.<br/><br/>"A normal cornstalk has one ear," explains agricultural expert Michelle Infante-Casella from Rutgers University. She certified the world record.</p>
