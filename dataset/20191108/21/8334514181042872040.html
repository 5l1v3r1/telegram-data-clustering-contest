      <p>BISSAU (Reuters) - Guinea-Bissau’s newly appointed Prime Minister Faustino Fudut Imbali handed in his resignation on Friday after an ultimatum was given by West African regional bloc ECOWAS, the president said.</p>
      <p>President Jose Mario Vaz named Imbali prime minister last week but his sacked predecessor Aristides Gomes refused to step down, triggering a political crisis in an already tensed context ahead of a presidential election.</p>
      <p>Vaz, who is running again in the Nov. 24 poll, dissolved the government saying the political situation was undermining the normal functioning of state institutions in the West African country.</p>
      <p>But regional bloc ECOWAS condemned the move, calling it illegal, and held an extraordinary summit on the Guinea-Bissau political situation in Niamey on Friday to pressure Imbali’s government to resign, threatening to apply sanctions if it didn’t comply.</p>
      <p>ECOWAS also warned that any implication of the army or security forces would be considered a coup and also met with sanctions.</p>
      <p>Instability in Guinea-Bissau has typically taken the form of military coups, led by officers drawn mostly from a narrow military elite who fought for independence in 1963-1974.</p>
