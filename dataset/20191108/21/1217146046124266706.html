      <p>It has been an busy week in terms of ransomware between a new variant of MegaCortex that performs something a bit different and MSP attacks against Everis in Spain.</p>
      <p>This week a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-megacortex-ransomware-changes-windows-passwords-threatens-to-publish-data/">new MegaCortex variant</a> was discovered that threatens to steal your data and publish it if you do not pay the ransom. In addition it states that your credentials have changed, which is not an idle threat as it does indeed change the victim's Windows password.</p>
      <p>In addition, we had a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attacks-hit-everis-and-spains-largest-radio-network/">major attack targeting Spain</a> with victims including the MSP Everis and SER, Spain's largest radio station network. It is not known if Everis was infected first and used to infect other clients or if they are different attacks. Either way it was a big mess for all involved.</p>
      <p>Other than that, we had new variants released as well as new distribution methods discovered.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research Team observed how a new ransomware family named ‘Buran’ appeared in May 2019. Buran works as a RaaS model like other ransomware families such as REVil, GandCrab (now defunct), Phobos, etc. The author(s) take 25% of the income earned by affiliates, instead of the 30% – 40%, numbers from notorious malware families like GandCrab, and they are willing to negotiate that rate with anyone who can guarantee an impressive level of infection with Buran. They announced in their ads that all the affiliates will have a personal arrangement with them.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>The total cost of a ransomware attack is a function of direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include the immediate remediation of the event, including the ransom if it must be paid. The indirect costs are the costs of business interruption associated with the attack. Business interruption costs are often 5-10x higher than direct costs. Lost revenue and long term brand damage are factors that weigh heavily on victims of ransomware who are not able to recover quickly. </p>

      </h4>
      <p>To help stem the tide of file-locking attacks, the FBI quietly convened the country’s top ransomware experts in an unprecedented, closed-door conference in September. The briefings, which occurred over two days, were a recognition by law enforcement officials that their ability to better investigate and prosecute ransomware cases hinges on the private sector sharing more data with them.</p>

      <p>It appears, however, that we may have been mistaken about the reason for the decrease. Data collected by the EPSRC EMPHASIS Ransomware project and shared with us by Professor David Wall of the University of Leeds shows mid-year spikes in previous years too.</p>
