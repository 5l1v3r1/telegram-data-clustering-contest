      <p>The Saskatchewan Roughriders remain cautious in their approach to Cody Fajardo’s recovery from an injured oblique muscle.</p>
      <p>The Green and White’s franchise quarterback was on the field for Friday’s practice at the AffinityPlex. Fajardo, however, didn’t attempt a pass during the 90-minute workout.</p>
      <p>“He’s still not going to throw,” said Riders head coach Craig Dickenson. “Even if he felt good or better, I wasn’t going to have him throw. We felt that he needed to get out here with the guys, run through the plays and call out the plays in the huddle. We didn’t want him throwing, but it was good to see him moving around.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/qb-cody-fajardo-tops-riders-depth-chart">Fajardo injured an oblique muscle during a practice on Oct. 30</a> and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-found-a-new-way-to-win-the-west">the injury sidelined him for Saturday’s 23-13 victory over the Edmonton Eskimos.</a><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-eyeing-the-bye-with-or-without-cody-fajardo">The win clinched first place for the Riders in the West Division, a feat rewarded with a bye and home-field advantage in the division final on Nov. 17.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-clinch-first-place-in-cfl-west-division">Rookie Isaac Harker filled in for Fajardo versus Edmonton, connecting on 23 of 28 passes for 213 yards without a touchdown or interception.</a> Besides taking snaps, Fajardo was primarily a bystander on Friday as Harker worked with the first-team offence.</p>

      <p>“It was good to see him out there because he has a positive aura about him,” Harker said. “The team loves him and it’s always good to have him out here doing whatever he can do.”</p>
      <p>As a result of the first-place bye, the Riders are off this weekend and resume on-field preparations for the West Division final on Wednesday. Fajardo is expected to test the injury on Thursday. If he can’t go, Dickenson said the Riders would turn to Harker again.</p>
      <p>But it sounded like Harker expects Fajardo to be at quarterback when the Riders play the winners of Sunday’s semifinal between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Calgary Stampeders.</p>
      <p>“You have to ask him, but if I was a betting man, I would bet that he will be playing,” Harker said.</p>

        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo-prepared-to-play-through-pain">Fajardo reiterated that position while meeting with the media on Thursday, pledging to play through the pain and be on the field with his teammates on Nov. 17.</a>

      <p>“At this point, it’s the playoffs and I will be on the field for the West final no matter how painful it is,” the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ quarterback vowed Thursday after it was announced that he’s the West Division nominee for the league’s most outstanding player award.</p>
      <p>“These ones are the toughest because it’s time,” Fajardo said of the injury. “There isn’t anything you can do that helps the healing process go any quicker. It’s frustrating because you want to be hands-on and you want to do as much as you can. Sometimes, less is better. If you do too much, then you can overwork it or cause more problems.</p>
      <p>“I have been really thankful about having this week off.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo threw a football-shaped whiffle ball on Thursday, which he termed “positive news.” He still expects some discomfort when he throws an actual football.</p>
      <p>“There will definitely be some pain in the game and some limitations,” Fajardo said. “At the end of the day, the adrenaline will take over and I’m excited for that to happen. The best drug that you can be on is adrenaline.”</p>
      <p>Receiver Shaq Evans was also the sideline for Friday’s practice. Evans, the Riders’ leading receiver with 1,334 yards and second with five receiving touchdowns, injured a toe during the victory over the Eskimos. The Riders are giving Evans as much time as needed for him to heal.</p>

      <p>In other pivot-related news, the Riders announced the signing of quarterback Justice Hansen before Friday’s practice. Hansen (6-foot-4, 224 pounds) recently spent time on the San Diego Chargers’ practice roster.</p>
      <p>Dickenson said that the addition Hansen gives the Riders another arm with Fajardo on the sideline. It also provides the Riders an opportunity to evaluate Hansen before the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see him playing this year,” Dickenson said. “We just wanted to get him familiar with the game and that our receivers have guys who can throw the ball to them.”</p>
