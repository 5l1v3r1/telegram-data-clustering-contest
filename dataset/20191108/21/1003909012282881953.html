      <p>It was cold that winter night in 2017 when a hundred-pound air conditioner was kicked through the top floor window of the Fraser &amp; Seabloom block in Inglewood. Not once, but several times. It was an event that resident Sam Mendoza remembers with great fondness.</p>
      <p>“We were out on the street watching it,” she says.</p>
      <p>The stunt was a (spoiler alert) murder scene filmed for a Season 3 episode of Fargo, a series produced by cable network FX. As a resident of the 117-year-old building on 9th Avenue S.E., Mendoza was only minorly inconvenienced during production. It only served to deepen her affection for the inner-city neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>“It’s such a great community. There is always something happening,” she says. “It’s also very ‘Cheers’ where everyone knows your name. Store owners, people who work in the pubs and the breweries.”</p>
      <p>Mendoza was born in Ponoka, educated in Edmonton and moved to Vancouver in 2004 where she launched her design career. High rent and poor job prospects sent her back to Alberta in 2015, where she’s established herself as a charitable streetwear and freelance graphic artist, working from the Nvrlnd non-profit art collective in Ramsay.</p>
      <p>This year, she made another exciting leap by purchasing her first home in a new condo project just two doors down from the Fraser &amp; Seabloom building. Irvine Urban is a six-storey, 59-unit mixed-use boutique development with one- and two-bedroom suites and five retail bays at street level. Construction has begun on the building located on the southwest corner of 9th Avenue S.E. and 13th Street S.E. with ample provision for underground and visitor parking.</p>
      <p>With the encouragement and financial support of her parents, who visit frequently from Ponoka and also enjoy Inglewood’s inner-city atmosphere, Mendoza and one of her sisters purchased the C-2 floor plan, a 733-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath suite on the fourth floor.</p>
      <p>“My sister and I had a serious talk about this investment. The amount of money I’m spending alone on rent could go on a mortgage,” she says.</p>
      <p>“Our parents inspired and motivated us. They said that it was time to have a place of our own. A place to call home and to have our own roots.”</p>
      <p>Irvine Developments sales associate Diane Harland says the suites are small and affordable; from 512 square feet to 760 square feet, starting at $269,745, GST included. The European-style suites are compact with hidden, built-in appliances, two-tone cabinetry, luxury plank flooring, granite sinks and quartz countertops and backsplashes. There’s nothing to upgrade, she explains.</p>
      <p>“We’ve kept the colour palette very neutral so you can bring in any colours you want,” she says.</p>
      <p>The suites have a smaller footprint but the over-sized windows more than make up for it.</p>
      <p>“There are nine-foot ceilings in every unit, except for the sixth floor where there are 11-, 14- and 16-foot ceilings with full height windows, so there will be plenty of natural light. And air conditioning,” she says.</p>
      <p>The decks, which range from 90 to 200 square feet, offer more living space and come with gas lines for barbecues. The Irvine will also have a rooftop patio where residents can entertain with views of the city skyline, the Bow River, Stampede Park and the Calgary Zoo.</p>
      <p>Mendoza hopes to move into her suite in late summer 2020, with her sister joining her from Vancouver sometime after that.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t seem real. I didn’t think that this would be possible.”</p>
      <p>The Irvine will officially launch on Friday, Nov. 15 with a public event from 5 to 8 p.m. at the sales centre, 1327A 9th Ave. S.E.</p>
