      <h2>Caitlyn Jenner, Nadine Coyle and Ian Wright are reportedly among the famous faces joining the I'm A Celebrity 2019 line-up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T21:05:55+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, Emmeline Saunders, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">I'm A Celebrity 2019 line-up</a> has been leaked - and it features a whole host of stars ready to tackle the beasts of the jungle.</p>
      <p>While ITV bosses are yet to confirm each of the big names, many of them have already been heavily rumoured in the last few weeks.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star Andrew Whyment and former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa are among the stars set to be heading to the jungle.</p>
      <p>Also joining them are Girls Aloud legend Nadine Coyle, DJ Roman Kemp and rugby player James Haskell, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10305954/im-a-celebrity-2019-full-line-confirmed-adele-roberts/">The Sun</a> have reported.</p>
      <p>An ITV spokesperson told Mirror Online: "We'll officially announce our I'm A Celebrity line up for 2019 in due course."</p>
      <p>Producers like to keep tight-lipped about the stars they've signed, but as the show is such a massive production, word always manages to slip out.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And with just over a week to go before the launch show, this weekend will see the celebs start trickling out to Australia, trying to remain incognito until they touch down in Oz.</p>
      <p>Host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/dec-donnelly-beams-touches-down-20838997">Declan Donnelly has already arrived Down Under</a> , joined by his wife Ali Astall and their one-year-old daughter Isla.</p>
      <p>Ali and Isla will be staying in the family accommodation some distance away from the smelly camp, meaning they'll get to relax in the sunshine while Dec commutes into the rainforest at the crack of dawn every morning.</p>
      <p>For the first time since 2017, he'll be joined by Ant McPartlin, who was replaced last year by Holly Willoughby after his drink-drive shame.</p>
      <p>Without further ado, here's a sneak peek at this year's I'm A Celebrity line-up.</p>
      <h3>Kate Garraway</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain host has been subject to intense speculation about her jungle stint, but continued to neither confirm nor deny the reports.</p>
      <p>That was until this morning, when her GMB colleagues started teasing her about I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/kate-garraways-stunned-reaction-im-20838756">Kate tried to remain unflustered</a> , but her face said it all when Richard Arnold mentioned an extra addition to the IAC cast.</p>
      <p>The showbiz reporter said: "There's always that extra bit of casting halfway through. They jettison someone quite close to you, perhaps someone you work with, as a bit of a spoiler."</p>
      <h3>Myles Stephenson</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>As Mirror Online exclusively revealed, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/myles-stephenson-fuels-im-cele">Myles was mysteriously absent from a scheduled appearance</a> by his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> band Rak-Su last night.</p>
      <p>As his bandmates Ashley Fongho, Jamaal Shurland and Mustafa Rahimtulla performed at the Christmas lights switch-on in Leeds, Myles was a no-show, sparking fresh rumours he's heading off to the jungle.</p>
      <p>Ashley from the band told the crowd: "We've got someone missing today. Myles is at home but he sends his love."</p>
      <h3>Ian Wright</h3>

      <p>Arsenal legend and football pundit Ian Wright is another name who has been thrown around over the last few weeks whenever the subject of the jungle has cropped up.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old star will be leaving behind his wife Nancy Hallum and his eight children for a shot at the crown.</p>
      <p>One person who'd love to see Ian there is pal and current King of the Jungle Harry Redknapp.</p>
      <p>The football legend exclusively told  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/im-celebs-harry-redknapp-fears-20571314">Mirror Online</a> : "He's crazy. Whether he can keep his cool for three weeks, that's the question."</p>
      <p>Harry laughed: "He'd be great fun. He's a great lad, Wright - I love him."</p>
      <h3>Adele Roberts</h3>

      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> star will be trading the house for the jungle as she is put to test among the creepy crawlies.</p>
      <p>Adele, who is currently a DJ on BBC Radio 1, is reportedly very excited to be heading into the jungle.</p>
      <p>A source told the publication: "Bosses reckon she's going to make fantastic television and will really get stuck into camp life."</p>
      <h3>Caitlyn Jenner</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner is set to head to the I'm A Celebrity jungle after reportedly <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/caitlyn-jenner-heading-im-celebrity-20791968">agreeing a staggering £500,000 fee</a>.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star, 70, will reportedly fly out to Australia for the ITV series ahead of the first episode airing on Sunday 17 November.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, who is dating Sophia Hutchins, 23, looks set to be the biggest signing of the year and has been lured by one of the highest ever salaries.</p>
      <h3>Nadine Coyle</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Girls Aloud star Nadine is entering the jungle.</p>
      <p>The Irish singer, 34, would be a fascinating watch as she could reveal secrets about the band's acrimonious split and her feud with Cheryl.</p>
      <p>A source told The Sun in October: “Nadine is a big name and  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/itv/">ITV</a>  was keen to get her.</p>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Coronation Street star Andrew Whyment is set to swap the Cobbles for a stint in the jungle after signing up for this year’s show.</p>
      <p>A source said: “Producers are really pleased with the line-up so far, with just a couple of faces to unveil.</p>
      <p>"There’s a chance they’ll add a couple more but in previous years they’ve stuck at ten with one or two to follow.</p>
      <p>“They were chuffed to get Andrew as viewers have watched him on Coronation Street for the best part of two decades, yet know nothing about him away from Kirk.”</p>
      <h3>Jacqueline Jossa</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Former EastEnders star Jacqueline is heading Down Under after reportedly previously turning down offers to appear on the show.</p>
      <p>Producers have been keen to get the actress on the show amid her turbulent relationship with ex-TOWIE star Dan.</p>
      <p>He recently opened up about his relationship with Jacqueline, saying they're stronger than ever after a rocky patch.</p>
      <p>Dan told Mirror Online: "It drives us mad when people write things [about our relationship] that aren’t true and need to have done their research more."</p>
      <h3>James Haskell</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Chloe Madeley's husband and rugby star James Haskell is set to venture into the jungle.</p>
      <p>His famous father-in-law Richard Madeley remained tight-lipped to rumours that James would be appearing on the show.</p>
      <p>He told Lorraine Kelly: "If I did know I wouldn't be able to say.</p>
      <p>"The last I heard of it... well I spoke to him yesterday. He's in Japan!"</p>
      <h3>Roman Kemp</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Capital FM DJ Roman Kemp is the final star lined up for I'm A Celebrity - something that was leaked after he told his employers that he is using his annual leave to appear on the show.</p>
      <p>Roman appearing on the show could send a lot of temperatures rising, if he decides to strip off to bathe in the show's famous lagoon or waterfall, as he recently unveiled he embarked on a 12-week fitness regime.</p>
      <p>The DJ revealed he had enlisted the help of Caroline Flack’s rumoured ex Bradley Simmonds to turn his dad bod into a rippling six-pack in under three months.</p>
      <p>As always, it's rumoured that at least one more celebrity will join the main cast once the series has kicked off.</p>
      <p>Last year we exclusively revealed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/noel-edmonds-set-join-im-13577189">Noel Edmonds was being parachuted in</a> as a secret bombshell - and this year is likely to see another well-known face jet in after the first couple of days to shake up the camp.</p>
