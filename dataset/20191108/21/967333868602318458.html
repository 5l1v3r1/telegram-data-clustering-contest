        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): In a bid to tackle the growing corruption problem in India, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Government revoked big currency notes on 8 November 2016, leaving people across the country shocked by the sudden announcement late in the evening.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Overnight, currency notes with the denominations of Rs. 1,000 ($14 approx.) and Rs.500 ($7 approx.) that comprised 86 per cent of the total currency circulation in India, were declared invalid.</p>
      <p>Although Prime Minister Modi said the decision aimed to counter terror funding and black money in the country, for a significant amount of time, people in the country struggled with their day-to-day lives because ATMs struggled to dispense the new currency, and over-crowded banks and inadequate currency notes of smaller denominations made cash-transactions quite challenging for common people.</p>
      <p>Friday marks the 3rd anniversary of the government’s demonetisation decision, netizens took to social media to timeline and discuss how the resolution actually impacted India's current financial situation.</p>
      <p>While some people believe the "bold" decision displayed foresight and was for the best, others have attacked Prime Minister Modi, blaming him for the ongoing economic slump in the country.</p>
      <p>While Modi aims to make India a $5 Trillion economy by 2025, India’s GDP growth is currently recorded as the slowest in over six years.</p>
      <p>Hashtags on the subject including -- #BlackDay, #आओ_मोदी_चौराहे_पर, #DeMonetisationDisaster, #NotebandiSeMandiTak, #Demonetisation and #3YearsOfDeMoDisaster are trending with over 3,500, 226,000, 590,000, 245,000 and 15,000 tweet mentions respectively in India.</p>

      <p>​Citing a recent survey by citizen engagement platform LocalCircles, media <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/%20india/story/3-years-of-%20demonetisation-66-say-it-had-%20negative-impact-33-blame-it-%20for-slowdown-survey-1616716-%202019-11-07">reported</a> that 66 per cent of respondents voted against demonetisation, saying it had a negative impact on the economy, labour and employment especially in unorganised sectors.</p>
      <p>In a lighter vein, some netizens wished the new colourful Indian currency notes that came into existence post-demonetisation a #HappyBirthday.</p>

      <p>​Others made it a point to note that it was because of demonetisation that India finally moved to digital payments for day-to-day financial transactions. </p>
      <p>From close to 1.5 million digital payment acceptance locations in 2016-17, the number of Indian merchants accepting digital payment modes has increased to over 10 million in three years, “Fintech in India - Powering mobile payments” had said earlier in August.</p>
      <p>With a population of over 1.7 billion, there was a percentage of Indians who praised Prime Minister Modi's bold decision intended to curb the terror and black money engulfing the country.</p>
