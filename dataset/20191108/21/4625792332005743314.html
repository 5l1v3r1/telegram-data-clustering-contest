      <p>Facebook announced it would be erasing any reference to the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/pinnacle-of-irresponsibility-attorneys-decline-to-confirm-cia-officer-eric-ciaramella-is-whistleblower">alleged whistleblower Eric Ciaramella</a> from its platform because it violates its terms of service.</p>
      <p>"Any mention of the potential whistleblower's name violates our coordinating harm policy, which prohibits content 'outing of witness, informant, or activists,'" a representative said in a statement Friday. "We are removing any and all mentions of the potential whistleblower's name and will revisit this decision should their name be widely published in the media or used by public figures in debate."</p>

      <p>Ciaramella <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vindman-and-whistleblower-still-work-together-on-u-s-policy-towards-ukraine">has been reported</a> as the whistleblower by several media outlets and elected officials. Facebook had accepted ad campaigns Thursday that featured Ciaramella's name <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/trumps-allies-have-been-attacking-the-person-they-say-is">until</a> BuzzFeed News got the platform to take them down. The company then announced they would be banning any naming of the rumored whistleblower.</p>
      <p>As a career CIA analyst, Ciaramella, 33, was on the National Security Council as the Ukraine director during the Obama administration. He stayed on for the early part of the Trump administration, during which he was the acting senior director for European and Russian affairs for a short period.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vindman-and-whistleblower-still-work-together-on-u-s-policy-towards-ukraine"><i>Washington Examiner</i> reported</a> on Nov. 6 that he is now a deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the National Intelligence Council, reporting to the director of national intelligence.</p>
