      <h1>Apple Watch fall detection makes hilarious appearance on James Corden’s ‘Late Late Show’</h1>

      <p>We’re seeing more and more extraordinary stories from Apple Watch customers who credit the device with saving their life. Now there’s one feature intended for life-saving that can add ‘comedic TV cameo with James Corden’ to its résumé.</p>
      <p>During a trivia segment from last night’s episode of <i>The Late Late Show with James Corden</i>, a special Apple Watch feature designed to detect sudden falls and call emergency services was unexpectedly triggered by a guest in the audience.</p>
      <p>Apple Watch <a href="https://amzn.to/36MTF2v">Series 4</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Nu4w9Q">Series 5</a> both <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208944">support fall detection</a> automatically in customers 65 or older; fall detection is off by default in younger customers due to activities like playing basketball or other sports accidentally triggering the feature.</p>
      <p>Fall detection’s hilarious appearance during James Corden’s trivia segment with the audience was fortunately a false alarm! No one got hurt, just a little surprised.</p>
      <p>It happened after an audience member correctly answered that the popular animated character Shrek debuted in the animated film called … <i>Shrek</i>.</p>
      <p>The siren tone of the fall detection alert can only be heard faintly in the background during the segment, but Corden notices the siren tone during a quieter moment with the next audience member.</p>
      <p>You can hear the hilarious incident during the 5 minute 39 second mark of the clip:</p>

      <p>At first glance, it appears that quickly sitting down may have triggered the false alarm. But based on when the siren can first be heard, it’s more likely that a sudden arm movement (possibly associated with an elevated heart rate from being on TV) may be what made this moment possible.</p>
