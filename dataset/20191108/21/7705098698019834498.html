      <h1>Disney+ Sets The Mandalorian’s Release Dates and Episode Synopses</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T21:18:35+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>There’s a lot of hype going into the premiere of the new <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> series <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian"><b>The Mandalorian</b></a> next week. Disney opted to keep that going by revealing the synopsis for its first three episodes, along with its official release schedule.</p>
      <p>The episodes have simple names for their chapters (“Chapter 1,” “Chapter 2”) and don’t provide many details. Here’s how they’re broken down:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Mandalorian bounty hunter tracks a target for a well-paying client. (Chapter One)</li>
        <li>Target in-hand, the Mandalorian must now contend with scavengers. (Chapter Two)</li>
        <li>The battered Mandalorian returns to his client for reward. (Chapter Three)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Showrunner Jon Favreau and company are apparently avoiding spoilers with these general descriptions. But it also hints that the show will have a larger story that goes forward with each episode.</p>

      <p>As for the release schedule, the episodes will be available on Disney+ on a weekly basis. The first episode will debut this Tuesday, November 12. After that, the shows will debut every Friday, with the next following on November 15. They’ll continue their run through December 27, when the first season finale airs.</p>
      <p>There’s already a <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/457637-jon-favreau-shares-more-details-about-the-mandalorian-season-2">second season of <b>The Mandalorian</b></a> in the works, as previously confirmed by Favreau. However, it doesn’t currently have a premiere date..</p>
      <p>Additionally, there’s now a <a href="https://www.marvel.com/disneyplus">Disney+ countdown clock</a>. Based on this, Disney+ will go live on Tuesday, November 12, around 9am EST. </p>
