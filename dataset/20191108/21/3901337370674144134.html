        <b>Absa Premiership</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Teams:</b> Bidvest Wits 0-1 SuperSport United</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 08 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Bidvest Stadium</p>
      <p>Sipho Mbule struck in the dying stages of the second half to send SuperSport United third in the Absa Premiership following victory over Bidvest Wits on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>Gift Motupa retained his spot in the line-up after netting four goals on CAF Confederation Cup duty last weekend as the Clever Boys were involved in their first league outing in five weeks.</p>
      <p>After a lively start to the encounter, the home side should have broken the deadlock after 17 minutes when Sifiso Hlanti did well to pick out Mxlosi Macuphu, who was unable to direct his effort on target from close range.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later, Gavin Hunt was forced into a re-shuffle as Sameehg Doutie picked up an apparent hamstring and was replaced by veteran winger Elias Pelembe.</p>
      <p>Despite SuperSport edging the possession for most of the half, chances were hard to come by in the final third as the visitors were often let down by their final pass, while Wits only managed to test Ronwen Williams in the opening 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>However, Hunt's charges came out the stronger of the two sides after the break as Pelembe went close to breaking the deadlock on the hour mark after firing over the top from inside the box.</p>
      <p>SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo responded with his first change on 68 minutes as Teboho Mokoena made way for Jamie Webber in a like-for-like switch.</p>
      <p>The hosts almost snatched the winner with five minutes remaining as Pelembe weaved his way into the box before picking out Terrence Dzuvukamanja, whose unorthodox finish was kept out by Williams, while Motupa squandered a good opening minutes later after being slipped through on goal.</p>
      <p>However, it was SuperSport who managed to claim the spoils in second-half stoppage time as Mbule rose well to nod into the far corner to seal three points for the visitors.</p>
