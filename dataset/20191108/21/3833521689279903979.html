      <h1>Continuum REIT IPO withdrawn after $1.72B takeover offer from Starlight Investments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T21:04:55+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 21:04</time> by <a rel="author">John Gray, Producer</a></address>
      <p>The highly-anticipated Continuum Residential Real Estate Investment Trust initial public offering has been withdrawn after the company accepted an all-cash offer from Toronto-based Starlight Investments valuing the REIT at more than $1.73 billion, according to a release from the companies.</p>
      <p>Continuum had reportedly been looking to raise more than $300 million through an IPO. The initial marketing process for the offering resulted in an order book of more than $1 billion, Dan Argiros, president and CEO of the REIT said in a release.</p>
      <p>“During the marketing process, Starlight approached the REIT to acquire its entire portfolio and made an offer that was superior to the IPO opportunity, which would have been priced between $15.50 to $16.50 per unit,” he said. “As a result, we have elected to proceed with the Starlight offer to acquire the portfolio and we will be withdrawing the IPO.”</p>
      <p>Continuum currently owns 44 apartment buildings, most of which are in Toronto and Hamilton.</p>
      <p>“The opportunity to acquire a 44 building, concrete, multi-residential high-rise portfolio located in the Greater Toronto Area is an extremely compelling opportunity to continue Starlight’s strategic growth,” Starlight president and CEO Daniel Drimmer said in the release.</p>
      <p>Michelle Wearing, a portfolio manager at Starlight Capital, spoke highly about the outlook for the IPO on BNN Bloomberg’s Market Call on Oct. 31.</p>
      <p>“These are quality assets (and) a good management team,” she said. “If you really think Toronto real estate is extremely hot this is going to be the best way to play it.”</p>
      <p>Starlight currently manages more than $11 billion worth of direct real estate and real estate investment securities.</p>
      <p>The company has been on a buying spree of late. In October alone Starlight announced the completion of apartment acquisitions in Barrie, Burlington, London and Mississauga, Ont.  </p>
      <p>In September, Starlight’s $69.9 million offer to purchase the Portage Place mall in downtown Winnipeg was approved by municipal, provincial and federal government regulators. </p>
