      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - “Wheel of Fortune” host <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pat-sajak/">Pat Sajak</a> had to have emergency surgery, and his longtime co-host <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vanna-white/">Vanna White</a> will fill in for him while he recovers.</p>
      <p>The show said in a statement that Thursday’s taping was canceled as the 73-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pat-sajak/">Sajak</a> underwent successful surgery to correct a blocked intestine.</p>
      <p>The 62-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vanna-white/">White</a> stepped in as host when taping resumed Friday for episodes that will air starting Dec. 9.</p>
      <p>The statement says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pat-sajak/">Sajak</a> is resting comfortably and looking forward to returning but does not say how long he is expected to be out or how long <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vanna-white/">White</a> will act as host.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pat-sajak/">Sajak</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vanna-white/">White</a> have co-hosted the show since the early 1980s.</p>
