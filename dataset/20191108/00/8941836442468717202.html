      <p>MADRID (AP) - Real Sociedad took a one-point lead of the Spanish league after drawing 1-1 at home with Leganés on Friday.</p>
      <p>Sociedad edged ahead of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> and Real Madrid - which both have two games in hand - at the crowded top of the table. Atlético Madrid and Sevilla are two points behind Sociedad, and Granada is three points off the Basque leader.</p>
      <p>“This means that we are doing things well,” said Sociedad goal-scorer Mikel Merino. “Each time we don’t take the full three points we are disappointed. But seeing us up there at the top gives us confidence.”</p>
      <p>Merino put the hosts in front in the 63rd minute when the midfielder headed in Adnan Januzaj’s corner.</p>
      <p>But substitute striker Youssef En-Nesyri outjumped his marker to head in Roque Mesa’s pass to level for Leganés in the 78th.</p>

      <p>Leganés goalkeeper Iván Cuéllar earlier saved shots from Merino and Januzaj with the score still 0-0.</p>
      <p>It was the first match for Leganés under new coach Javier Aguirre and the team had a good performance in defending against one of the best attacks in the league.</p>
      <p>Leganés stayed in last place. The modest Madrid-based club has lost nine of 13 matches.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> hosts Celta Vigo on Saturday, when Real Madrid visits Eibar. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> and Madrid will play their delayed “clásico” match on Dec. 18.</p>
