      <p>Nike will investigate allegations of abuse by runner Mary Cain while she was a member of Alberto Salazar’s training group.</p>
      <p>Cain joined the disbanded Nike Oregon Project run by Salazar in 2013, soon after competing in the 1,500-meter final at track and field’s world championships when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Now 23, Cain tells The New York Times in a video essay that under Salazar’s direction she was told to lose weight and he created an “arbitrary number of 114 pounds.” Cain says she started having suicidal thoughts and cutting herself.</p>
