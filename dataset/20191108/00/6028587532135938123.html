      <p>You’ve tried all the sleep expert-approved tricks: Going to bed the same time every night, keeping your room cool and dark like a cave, and powering down electronics so the blue light doesn’t disrupt you. Still, those ZZZ’s are evasive. It’s time to call in some back up. As your body clock adjusts to Daylight Savings, these 7 products can perform Sandman-like duties and help you get to sleep … and do so fast.<b>White Noise Machine</b></p>
      <p>A white noise machine can create a steady hum that helps block out more jolting sounds, whether that’s the crescendo of your partner’s snoring or the honks and beeps of city traffic. A note of caution, though: If you are a light sleeper, you might want to avoid the nature-like settings that are common on sound machines, even if “ocean” or “meadow” types of settings sound peaceful. That’s because they have varying pitches, which could end up keeping you awake. When you’re shopping for a white noise machine or soothing fan, consider whether it fits in with your bedroom decor as its something you’ll probably keep on your nightstand. </p>

        <b>Melatonin</b>
      </p>
      <p>The hormone that helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle is known as melatonin. Interestingly, it’s also found in some foods like tart cherries, pomegranates, cucumbers, asparagus, rice, barley, walnuts, sunflower seeds and flaxseed. Because melatonin is naturally occurring in some foods, it’s not subject to the same regulations as other hormones are, and you can find melatonin supplements in stores. Research suggests that melatonin best improves sleep if you have jet lag or are a shift worker, according to the <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/melatonin-and-sleep">National Sleep Foundation</a>. But, some studies show that melatonin can also help you fall asleep faster and reduce the number of times you wake up at night.</p>
