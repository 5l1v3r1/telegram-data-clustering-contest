      <p>President Duterte has approved the release of his remaining contingency fund for the Department of Agriculture’s (DA) indemnification program for hog raisers affected by the African swine fever (ASF), Malacañang announced on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Duterte gave the approval during the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday upon the request of Agriculture Secretary William D. Dar. </p>
      <p>“It is necessary because we need funds to help the hog raisers, whose livelihood have been affected by the [African] swine fever,” Presidential Spokesman Salvador S. Panelo said during a media briefing. </p>
      <p>In an SMS, Dar told BusinessMirror they will now be getting the full P1 billion they earlier requested from the contingency fund of the Office of the President. </p>
      <p>He said the amount will be used to indemnify hog raisers. The DA said it already culled 70,000 hogs due to ASF. It committed to pay P5,000 per head to the affected raisers. </p>
      <p>It continues to intensify its control measures against ASF as it has, now spread to Caloocan, Malabon and 22 cities and municipalities in Pampanga and Bulacan. </p>
      <p>Dar said they plan to designate cold storage areas in the Ports of Manila, Subic, Batangas, Cebu and Davao for complete monitoring of meat products entry. </p>
      <p>Panelo said Duterte is currently satisfied with DA’s efforts in containing the ASF. </p>
