      <p>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) - The opposing sides in Bolivia’s disputed election are not budging following 17 days of violent protests over the legitimacy of President Evo Morales’ apparent re-election.</p>

      <p>Three people are dead and more than 300 people are injured in a wave of protests across Bolivia over the results of the Oct. 20 election.</p>
