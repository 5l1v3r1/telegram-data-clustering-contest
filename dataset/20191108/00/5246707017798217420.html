      <p>This week, it's been a celebration of all-things SNK, with the release of Terry Bogard in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> and select fighting games on the eShop <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/select_aca_neo_geo_fighting_games_on_the_switch_eshop_are_currently_50_percent_off">currently half price</a> until 20th November. To go out with a bang, Hamster has now added one of the company's top-down vertically scrolling shmup to the Arcade Archives collection.</p>
      <p>Introducing <b>T.N.K III</b> (otherwise known as <b>T.A.N.K.</b>) – a classic arcade game first released in 1985 where you take control of a tank and destroy everything in sight. Here's the backstory and some screens from the PR:</p>
      <blockquote>In the last years of the great war, when authorities get word that an enemy nation is developing weapons on a small island, they order a special task force to destroy the enemy's development facilities.<br/><br/>Colonel RALF of the special task force learns that this is crucial for victory and decides to take on the sabotage mission alone.</blockquote>
