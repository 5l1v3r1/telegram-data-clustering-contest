      <p>CHICAGO (AP) - The Blackhawks returned to home ice and got back to basics against one of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a>’s most improved teams.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-kane/">Patrick Kane</a> had a power-play goal and two assists, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Vancouver Canucks</a> 5-2 on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Alex DeBrincat and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-shaw/">Andrew Shaw</a> scored in the first period, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dylan-strome/">Dylan Strome</a> had three assists as the Blackhawks dealt Vancouver its first regulation loss since Oct. 19 at New Jersey. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-kampf/">David Kampf</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-saad/">Brandon Saad</a> added empty-netters as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> struck early and effectively managed a lead following a 1-2-1 road trip.</p>
      <p>“Big win for us, obviously, coming home from a long trip and to a difficult opponent,” coach Jeremy Colliton said. “We would like to find a way to string two, three, four, five games together.”</p>
      <p>The Blackhawks (5-7-3) have scuffled early but were in control during most of this one. Corey Crawford, who made 36 saves, was sharp when the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Canucks</a> got close.</p>

      <p>“We had a pretty solid game all-around,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dylan-strome/">Strome</a> said. “When you’re playing with the lead, you’re not really chasing it. You’re comfortable.”</p>
      <p>The Blackhawks matched their best offensive output so far this season and scored twice with the man advantage for the first time since Feb. 22, a span of 35 games.</p>
      <p>“A few guys got on the scoreboard tonight and that’s a good thing too,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-kane/">Kane</a> said. “Now we go from here.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-shaw/">Shaw</a>’s power-play score ended his 12-game goal drought.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>J.T. Miller and Jake Virtanen scored for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Canucks</a>, who entered on a 5-0-3 run to climb to second place in the Pacific Division. Jacob Markstrom blocked 32 shots.</p>
        <p>This game was mostly a clunker for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Canucks</a> coach Travis Green.</p>
        <p>“I’ve said we’ve played well most of the game this year, but tonight I don’t think we played that well,” Green said. “We didn’t look sharp. We didn’t handle the puck very well.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Canucks</a> have just one win in their last four (1-1-2).</p>
        <p>“We’re getting points in pretty much every game,” Markstrom said. “It’s easy to say we haven’t had win in a while, but we haven’t lost at home in regulation. If we keep that going, it’s going to be successful.”</p>
        <p>DeBrincat opened the scoring 6:41 in from high in the slot. After slipping free from rookie defenseman Quinn Hughes, DeBrincat fired as he tumbled and beat Markstrom on the stick side.</p>
        <p>Vancouver defenseman Troy Stecher saved a goal when he dropped and blocked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-kampf/">Kampf</a>’s point-blank one-timer with about seven minutes left in the period.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-shaw/">Shaw</a> made it 2-0 with 1:17 remaining in the first, just 11 seconds after Miller was sent off for hooking. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-shaw/">Shaw</a> one-timed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dylan-strome/">Strome</a>’s feed from behind the net to finish a quick, tight passing play.</p>
        <p>Miller deflected in a power-play goal at 1:03 of the second, scoring with just one second left on Jonathan Toews’ slashing penalty. Miller was a parked just left of the net when Elias Pettersson’s pass across the creased caromed in off the shaft of his stick.</p>
        <p>Crawford stopped Brock Boeser’s close-in backhander with 8:02 left to preserve the lead.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-kane/">Kane</a>’s goal, his fifth, with 5:06 left in the third made it 3-1. He beat Markstrom on the glove side with a screened shot from just above the left circle.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-kampf/">Kampf</a>’s short-handed empty netter with 2:07 left gave <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> a 4-1 lead.</p>
        <p>Virtanen deflected Alexander Edler’s shot from the point with 1:01 left to cut it to 4-2, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-saad/">Saad</a> scored into an empty net with six seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>NOTES: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Canucks</a> D Christopher Tanev left the game after the first period with an undisclosed injury. Green didn’t have an update after the game. . <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-shaw/">Shaw</a> hadn’t scored since connecting twice in the Blackhawks home opener on Oct. 10 versus San Jose. … Blackhawks rookie F Dominik Kubalik was a healthy scratch after skating in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a>’s first 14 games. … Markstrom nearly scored an own-goal about six minutes into the second. He came out to play a loose puck with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dylan-strome/">Strome</a> closing in, but instead of backhanding it behind the net, he hit the side of it.</p>
