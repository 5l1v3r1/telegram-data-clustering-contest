      <p>Tubular Labs did an analysis, based in part on their data, as to the revenue that should be coming to digital video publishers, far below what is currently received.

Bottom line - the publishers and producers of digital video could be making a lot more money on their digital video content and a number of steps can be taken to increase that revenue.
