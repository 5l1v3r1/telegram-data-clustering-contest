      <p>FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) - Indiana had a higher percentage of people lacking medical insurance than any neighboring state in 2018.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Census Bureau said Thursday that 8.3% of the state’s residents were uninsured last year, while only 5.4% were not covered in Michigan and 5.6% in Kentucky.</p>
      <p>Director of the Community Research Institute at Purdue University Fort Wayne Rachel Blakeman says Kentucky and Michigan have been aggressively expanding Medicaid programs.</p>
      <p>The Census Bureau said 43.5% of Kentuckians had Medicare or Medicaid last year. the figure for Indiana was 33.8%.</p>
      <p>Blakeman says a strong economy has played a big role in lowering uninsured rates as more people are working for employers that provide insurance.</p>
