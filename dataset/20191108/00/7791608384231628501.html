      <p><b>The Met Gala</b> has become a yearly affair of illustrious celebrities walking down red carpets in stunning outfits that the world can’t help but marvel at. <br/><b>Each year,</b> a theme is selected, indicating the kind of style stars should embody. The Met Ball is accompanied by the Costume Institute exhibition, and in 2020, the event will explore the history of fashion. <br/><b>According to <i><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/costume-institute-2020-exhibition-metgala-theme-about-time-fashion-duration/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Vogue</a></i>,</b> the exhibition and gala will bear a ‘Time: Fashion and Duration’ concept. <br/><b>Andrew Bolton,</b> the curator of the prestigious spectacle, also divulged with <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/met-gala-2020-theme-is-time-and-co-chairs-include-meryl-streep/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>US Magazine</i></a> that the theme was inspired by the 1992 film <i>Orlando</i>, which is based on a Virginia Woolf novel of the same title. <br/><b>Bolton shared that</b> he had found the event’s muse in a scene where Tilda Swinton runs around a maze wearing an “18th-century woman’s robe à la Francaise,” which then changes into a mid-19th-century dress and finally “reemerges in 1850s England.” <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>He added that</b> he favored Woolf’s concept of time, which he thought was “the idea of a continuum.” He further expressed that there isn’t a start, middle or end but “one big fat middle.” <br/><b>Bolton elaborated that</b> he has always resonated that notion with fashion, declaring that, “Fashion is the present.” <br/><b>Those keen</b> on watching the inspiration behind Met Gala 2020’s concept can enjoy the scene below.</p>
