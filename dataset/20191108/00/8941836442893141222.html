      <h1>AP source: CBS to air Champions League in USstarting in 2021</h1>

      <p>A person familiar with the negotiations says Champions League broadcasts in the U.S. will move from Turner to CBS beginning with the 2021-22 season.</p>
      <p>The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Friday because the agreement has not been announced by UEFA, European soccer’s governing body. The three-year deal will begin in August 2021.</p>
      <p>Turner is in its second season airing the Champions League on TNT, but most of the matches through the round of 16 are on Bleacher Report’s streaming package.</p>
      <p>Univision will retain the U.S. rights for Spanish-language broadcasts. CBS and Univision will pay $140 million a season, an increase from the $100 million in the current Turner/Univision deal.</p>
      <p>Sports Business Journal was the first to report on CBS acquiring the rights.</p>
