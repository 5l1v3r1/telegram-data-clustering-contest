      <p><b>STOCKHOLM </b>A Swedish team has salvaged hundreds of bottles of liquor from the wreck of a ship sunk during World War I in the Baltic Sea. <br/><br/>Ocean X, a group that specialises in salvaging alcohol from shipwrecks, said it was testing the bottles from a cargo bound for Russia to see if they were still fit to drink. <br/><br/><br/>The group brought 600 bottles of cognac and 300 bottles of Benedictine – a herbal liqueur – to shore on October 22 after recovering them from the wreck of the Kyros, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1917. Bottles of the cognac, produced by the now-defunct distillers De Haartman, and the Benedictine are being tested in a laboratory. <br/><br/>“The conditions in the Baltic are very suitable for storing these kind of beverages because it’s... dark and very cold,” said Peter Lindberg, who led the expedition. <br/><br/><br/>The Kyros left Sweden in May 1917 and was sunk in the Sea of Aland with an explosive charge.</p>
