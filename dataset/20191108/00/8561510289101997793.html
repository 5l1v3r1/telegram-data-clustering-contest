      <h1>India’s Space Agency Wants to Explore Venus</h1>

      <h3>Hey Neighbor</h3>
      <p>The Indian Space Research Organization wants to launch a mission to Venus.</p>
      <p>The ultimate goal is to use an orbiter to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/venus-covered-crystal-volcanoes">map the entire planet</a>, as well as to scan and figure out what’s going on beneath the surface, <a href="https://www.space.com/india-considering-venus-orbiter-mission.html">according to <i>Space.com</i></a>. If the mission takes off, it could help give scientists a much better understanding of our planetary neighbor — including information about how its <a href="https://futurism.com/has-the-origin-of-venus-atmospheric-y-been-found">bizarre atmosphere</a> behaves.</p>
      <h3>Closer Look</h3>
      <p>The space agency is currently awaiting the green light for the mission. If all goes to plan, it may launch as soon as 2023, <i>Space.com</i> reports.</p>
      <p>Once it arrives, the orbiter would be able to create a map of Venus is just about a year, while also using scientific instruments to study the planet’s atmosphere, volcanic activity, and intense lightning storms.</p>
      <p>India’s space program suffered a setback when its Moon lander <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/indian-official-moon-lander-survived">crashed in September</a>. But because the Venus mission wouldn’t involve actually touching down on the surface, it may have a brighter future.</p>
