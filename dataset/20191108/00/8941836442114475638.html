      <p>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - A Pennsylvania appeals court says a game warden had the right to seize a wildlife camera without a warrant during an investigation into illegal elk feeding in Elk County.</p>
      <p>A three-judge Commonwealth Court panel on Friday overturned a county judge’s ruling that a Game Commission wildlife conservation officer acted improperly in taking the camera.</p>
      <p>The opinion says the officer warned 53-year-old Keith Robert Laskovich in 2016 not to feed elk at his hunting camp adjacent to a state game land, then seized the camera the following year.</p>
      <p>The warden later got a search warrant for the camera’s memory card and charged Laskovich with illegally feeding elk.</p>

        <p>A judge threw out the evidence, but the appeals court says the camera was in plain view so the seizure didn’t violate privacy rights.</p>
