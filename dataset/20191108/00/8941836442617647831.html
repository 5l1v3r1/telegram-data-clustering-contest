      <p>FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) - The family of 6-year-old Colorado boy who died after being hit in a crosswalk outside his school is inviting the public to his funeral.</p>
      <p>A service will be held for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vale/">Vale</a> Wolkow at First Presbyterian Church in Fort Collins at 11 a.m. Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Coloradoan newspaper reports that a livestream will be available in the church’s fellowship hall to accommodate those who can’t fit inside the church.</p>
      <p>The kindergartner died Tuesday after he was hit by an SUV driven by a 23-year-old man. Police say the driver had stopped at a four-way stop and then drove forward, hitting the boy.</p>
      <p>Police are still investigating but don’t believe that speed, alcohol or drugs were a contributing factor.</p>
