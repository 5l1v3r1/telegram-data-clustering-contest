      <p>DENVER (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-ethics-commission/">Colorado Ethics Commission</a> is releasing an investigation into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-hickenlooper/">John Hickenlooper</a>’s use of private planes while governor.</p>
      <p>A Republican critic filed a complaint alleging <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-hickenlooper/">Hickenlooper</a> had improperly traveled on private flights during his administration. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-hickenlooper/">Hickenlooper</a> is a Democrat who is challenging Republican Sen. Cory Gardner.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-ethics-commission/">commission</a>’s investigation comes to no conclusions about the ethics of the former governor’s plane travel. It shows that he paid for some of the flights he took such as on a private plane to officiate at the Texas wedding of the brother of entrepreneur Elon Musk. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-hickenlooper/">Hickenlooper</a> did not pay for a flight to Connecticut on a plane owned by the company of a billionaire supporters.</p>
