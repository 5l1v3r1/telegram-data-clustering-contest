      <p>(VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.) — The slam of a courtroom door has led to time in the slammer for a Virginia teen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-slammed-courtroom-door-20191107-6fgpkrib3zg5lch5yxrop6s7ua-story.html">The <i>Virginian-Pilot</i></a> reports Sonnia Gaston went to a Virginia Beach courtroom on Wednesday to support her boyfriend in a probation violation case. When 20-year-old Tyrese Lavell McEachern was sentenced to 90 days in jail, the 18-year-old Gaston slammed one of the double wooden doors as she left the courtroom.</p>
      <p>Gaston returned to the courtroom to pick up a binder that had been left behind, and that’s when Circuit Judge Stephen Mahan called her to the defense table to explain her behavior. She responded that she was angry.</p>
      <p>For her outburst, Gaston was found in contempt of court and sentenced to 10 days in jail.</p>
