      <p>BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) - T.J. Atwood scored a career-high 25 points on 11-of-16 shooting and Lamar beat NCCAA-member Arlington Baptist 106-61 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Atwood was one of six players in double figures for the Cardinals (2-0).</p>
      <p>Corey Nickerson scored 21, Ayaan Sohail and Davion Buster each scored 12, Ellis Jefferson, 11, and David Muoka scored 10. Lamar struggled from beyond 3-point range shooting just 2 of 18, however, they took advantage of their size and finished 47-of-91 shooting (52 overall.</p>
      <p>The Patriots fought tough early and took a 19-18 lead on Sheldon Hodges’ layup with 10:23 before halftime. That led to a 21-3 Lamar run that included seven straight from Muoka on a three-point play, followed by a pair of free throws and a dunk. The Cardinals led 47-31 at halftime.</p>
      <p>Lamar opened the season with 46-point win against Champion Christian on Tuesday night.</p>
