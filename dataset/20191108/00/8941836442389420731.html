      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg is staring down at pedestrians in the heart of San Francisco where an artist is painting a massive mural of the Nobel Peace Prize nominee.</p>
      <p>SFGate reports Friday that Argentine muralist Andres Iglesias, who signs his art with the pseudonym Cobre, is set to finish the artwork of the Swedish 16-year-old in Union Square by next week.</p>
      <p>Iglesias tells SFGate that he’s donating his time to complete the work and that he hopes the mural helps people realize “we have to take care of the world.”</p>
      <p>He also painted a mural of Robin Williams in downtown San Francisco that has since been demolished.</p>
      <p>Cobre says he was searching for a building for a new mural when environmental nonprofit oneatmosphere.org approached him about the project.</p>
