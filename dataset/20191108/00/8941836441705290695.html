      <p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - An Alabama commission considering laws about medical marijuana met at the State House to discuss the draft of a medical marijuana bill that’ll be introduced to the Legislature next year.</p>
      <p>News outlets report the Medical Marijuana Study Commission met Thursday, the last time they’ll meet before the Dec. 1 filing deadline.</p>
      <p>Sen. Tim Melson, and commission chair, asked commission members to study the proposal and make any recommended changes.</p>
      <p>Melson championed a medical marijuana bill last spring. It went through the Alabama Senate but stalled at the House.</p>
      <p>The bill would create a Medical Cannabis Commission to manage issuing medical cannabis cards to patients.</p>
