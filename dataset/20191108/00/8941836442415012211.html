      <p>BOSTON (AP) - A lawyer for an orthopedic surgeon says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/massachusetts-general-hospital/">Massachusetts General Hospital</a> has agreed to pay $13 million to settle a wrongful termination lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The Boston Globe reports <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dennis-burke/">Dr. Dennis Burke</a>’s lawyer disclosed the settlement terms Thursday, which included offering <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dennis-burke/">Burke</a> his job back and naming a hospital safety initiative after him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dennis-burke/">Burke</a> was fired in 2015 for allegedly violating patient confidentiality, but he contends he was dismissed for raising safety concerns about colleagues performing two operations at once.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dennis-burke/">Burke</a> is a 67-year-old hip and knee specialist whose patients have included former Secretary of State John Kerry .</p>
      <p>He says he’s glad to move on from the dispute. He declined the job offer, so he’ll become honorary staff.</p>
