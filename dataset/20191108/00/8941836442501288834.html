      <h1>BOOK REVIEW: ‘The Russia Trap’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Henry R. Nau</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>What’s the right approach to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a>? During the Cold War, soft-liners argued for detente and arms control. Hard-liners clamored for an arms race and ideological victory. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Ronald Reagan</a> forged a hybrid approach: Rearmament to convince the Soviet Union it could not compete; ideological clarity to avoid a cynical co-existence with tyranny; and negotiations to facilitate Soviet domestic reforms.</p>
      <p>How does the United States approach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> today? Some call for sanctions and cyberwarfare to retaliate against Russian aggression in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> and U.S. elections. Others urge caution because <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> is weak and easily threatened by Western retaliation and arrogance.</p>
      <p>In “The Russia Trap,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-beebe/">George Beebe</a> rejects the focus on either intentions or capabilities: “[T]he US-Russian relationship is not primarily a function of the capabilities [weak or strong] or intentions [aggressive or defensive] of either party … [but] of a complex systems danger … in which multiple factors interact and reinforce or diminish one another …” leading to unintended consequences and accidental war.</p>
      <p>The book details frightening scenarios of how <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> and the United States might get trapped in a shadow war of cyber conflicts, deadly perceptions that the one side intends to destroy the other side, and arms races without rules.</p>
      <p>It develops believable scenarios, based on actual events, whereby religious conflicts in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> trigger deeper Russian aggression or cyberattacks on Ukrainian gas pipeline control systems escalate into reciprocal strikes against Russian infrastructure and U.S. satellite systems.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>The trap closes very rapidly as “coercive steps against a state that already sees itself as threatened wind up magnifying perceptions of vulnerability and triggering a dangerous escalatory reaction.”</p>
      <p>So, what do we do about this systems-driven trap? Stop treating the problem as singular or linear, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-beebe/">Mr. Beebe</a> counsels. Take a wholistic approach and be humble. Don’t proselytize for democracy in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> or elsewhere. Be an example and plan for resilience in policy not control. </p>
      <p>These general prescriptions lead to some practical and on balance reasonable recommendations for contemporary U.S. policy toward <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a>. First, declare that the United States and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> are not partners or enemies but competitors, looking for ways “to keep their competition within safe, mutually respected bounds.” </p>
      <p>Second, accept multipolarity as a fact (include China) and seek equilibrium not primacy, albeit as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-beebe/">Mr. Beebe</a> writes, “an aspirational equilibrium,” which addresses both territorial integrity and “the importance of defending human rights.” </p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Third, withdraw from Afghanistan and revert to an offshore balancer role in Central Asia. (Does the same apply in the Middle East? Mr. Beebe doesn’t say.) </p>
        <p>Fourth, in Europe, be “reluctant to stray beyond NATO’s borders to add members or undertake out-of-area missions … [and] share an interest in working to contain and manage instability in the unaligned states in between NATO and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a>” (174). In effect, although Mr. Beebe doesn’t use the term, treat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, the Caucasus and perhaps the Middle East as “buffer” zones. </p>
        <p>Fifth, mind our own garden and regain a self-confidence that shrugs off notions that American democracy can be easily undermined by Russian meddling and propaganda. </p>
        <p>The book is felicitously written and reflects the keen insights and expertise of a veteran high-level intelligence officer, who now serves as vice president and director of studies at the Center for the National Interest. Mr. Beebe’s basic warning is also well-taken. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> is not an existential threat to American democracy, and the United States (or NATO) is not the biggest obstacle to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a>’s recovery from its Cold War trauma.</p>
        <p>Yet, Mr. Beebe’s focus may be too narrow. While he dwells on complex systems interactions and the likelihood of nuclear catastrophe between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> and the United States, he does not compare this likelihood with that of an existential clash with China, an eruption of Muslim extremism in the Middle East or a planetary catastrophe due to climate change. Other traps exist and may spiral out of control. Does the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> trap take priority?</p>
        <p>Moreover, whatever complex systems exist outside countries, they also exist inside countries. Countries organize domestic political and economic systems to serve conflicting ideological aims. Vladimir Putin intervened in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> not because NATO and the EU represented a military threat (there were no NATO soldiers on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a>’s borders) but because he did not want the Ukrainian people to have free choice of economy, politics and religion that citizens in Moscow might then demand. </p>
        <p>Thus, substantive differences between authoritarian and liberal societies are as much a source of deadly misperceptions in world affairs as complex systems dynamics. Human rights mean very different things in Washington, Moscow, Tehran and Beijing, complicating the search for an “aspirational” equilibrium. </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-beebe/">George Beebe</a> is right. We should do more to empathize with the interests of other countries but we should also be upfront about ideological differences. In the end, President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> found the best path to confront tyranny while managing peaceful outcomes. </p>
