      <p>ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/croatia/">Croatia</a> says a record 20 million people visited the Adriatic Sea country this year.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Tourism said Friday in a statement this is the first time that so many arrivals have been recorded in one year in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/croatia/">Croatia</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/croatia/">Croatia</a> is a popular tourism destination because of its stunning Adriatic Sea coast and dozens of islands. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/croatia/">Croatia</a>’s coastal resorts are routinely packed during the summer season.</p>
      <p>The ministry statement says tourism in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/croatia/">Croatia</a> has “flourished” in the past several years. It says the most popular destinations include the walled ancient city of Dubrovnik, Rovinj, Porec and Medulin on the northern Istria peninsula, as well as the central coastal town of Split.</p>
