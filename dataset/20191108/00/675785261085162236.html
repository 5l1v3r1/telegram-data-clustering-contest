      <h1>Marcus Rashford says Man Utd must improve after sealing Europa League knockout place</h1>
      <h2>Striker urged Red Devils to be more ruthless following 3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T00:06:17+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 00:06</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Marcus Rashford said Manchester United must be more ruthless - despite the Red Devils sealing their place in the Europa League knockout stage with two games to spare.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-united-3-0-partizan-20836060">claimed their biggest win</a> since their 4-0 opening day victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> as Rashford scored along with teenage striker Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial.</p>
      <p>Rashford could have had a hat-trick in the first half but had to wait until just after the restart to score, and claimed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> need to be more clinical in front of goal.</p>
      <p>"I think it was a good performance but there are things we can improve on," said Rashford. "We managed to score three goals but it could have been a lot more.</p>
      <p>"There were a couple of times where I was half a yard too forward, so it was a game of fine margins, but we're happy with the three goals.</p>

      <p>"For me, it's about recognising it and trying to correct it in the next game, but I won't let it stay on my mind for too long."</p>
      <p>Rashford heaped praise on Greenwood, 18, who set United on their way with the opening goal - his third of the season.</p>
      <p>"He's done very well," said Rashford. "He just needs to keep knuckling down and working hard and the goals will come, because he has a lot of quality.</p>
      <p>"We're pleased to have qualified, but we really want to finish in top position and we have two more games to do it so we are in a good position."</p>

      <p>United boss Solskjaer agreed with Rashford, saying his side could have made the game safe much earlier than they did.</p>
      <p>"We needed a win, but we needed a performance in which the boys wanted to go forward," said the manager. "We could have had loads more tonight, but it was a pleasing performance.</p>
      <p>'You expect to win at home against teams like this, no disrespect to Partizan. We should have buried it in the first ten minutes, really. But going into half-time with a 2-0 lead, you're confident."</p>

      <p>United midfielder Juan Mata added: "We needed a game like this, playing good football, scoring in the first half and enjoying ourselves.</p>
      <p>"We did that for long periods and the fans are happy today and we have qualified.</p>
      <p>"We are doing okay in this competition. We've qualified, which was the first objective, but we want to be top."</p>
