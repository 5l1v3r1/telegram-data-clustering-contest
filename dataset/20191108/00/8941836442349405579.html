      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michelle-obama/">Michelle Obama</a> on Thursday unveiled her star-studded “voting squad” as her nationwide get-out-the-vote effort ahead of the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>The former first lady posted a video from her When We All Vote campaign that features A-list celebrities such as Tom Hanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Selena Gomez.</p>
      <p>“Last year, we went big,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michelle-obama/">Mrs. Obama</a> says in the video. “Millions of new voters made their voices heard for the first time. Now, the stakes are even higher.</p>
      <p>“That’s why I’ve been reaching out to some friends to expand my voting squad for the year ahead,” she says in the video.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michelle-obama/">Mrs. Obama</a> serves as a co-chair on When We All Vote along with Mr. Hanks, Mr. Miranda and Ms. Gomez.

      <p>“It all starts with you,” the celebrities say in the video. “You’re the only person that can have that conversation with your family and your friends and your girlfriends and even with your community to get them registered and ready to vote. … When we all vote, we can change the world.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Hanks said, ”Registering new voters is an act of hope and taking part in the American idea,” the Associated Press <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/more-celebs-join-michelle-obamas-voter-outreach-drive/2019/11/07/5b8a60d4-0166-11ea-8341-cc3dce52e7de_story.html">reported</a>. He added that voting guarantees the blessings of ”liberty for the grandkids.”</p>
