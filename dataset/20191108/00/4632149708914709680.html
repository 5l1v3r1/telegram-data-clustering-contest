      <p><i>MP wants repair work on damaged stretch to be complete within 2 mnths</i> <br/><br/>Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya inspected the Bannerghatta Road and directed officials to take up the pending work at the earliest. Following a series of reports in BM about the poor condition of Bannerghatta Road, the MP visited the area along with officials on Thursday. <br/><br/>"I really thank Mirror for highlighting the plight and I have been seriously following the reports. We shall soon ensure that some action is taken to solve the issue," he said. <br/><br/>Earlier, Tejasvi inspected a 3-km stretch between Vega City Mall and Swagat Junction. The residents complained about the culverts being built unscientifically and work on it not being complete. <br/><br/>Tejasvi asked Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara P alike Commissioner Anil Kumar to transfer errant officials immediately. <br/><br/>"The condition of the footpath in front of the IIM-B campus is really bad. The slabs are broken and garbage is being dumped in the drain. <br/><br/>Right at the entrance of the institution, there is an open drain and sewage water is flowing into it," he said. <br/><br/>Tejasvi noted that a number of hospitals are located on Bannerghatta Road and the stench from the area is affecting the patients. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the MP also directed officials from BMRCL, BWSSB and BBMP to come up with a plan in 10 days to fix the damaged stretch on the Bannerghatta Road and repair it within two months.</p>
