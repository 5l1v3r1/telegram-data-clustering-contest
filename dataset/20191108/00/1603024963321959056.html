        <b>ICICI Direct's currency report on USDINR</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Spot Currency</b>
      </p>
      <p>The rupee closed slightly higher by two-paise yesterday supported by an appreciating Chinese Yuan and positive inflows in the last few sessions. However, it is likely to open sharply lower today amid strength in US$ and rising concerns over domestic fiscal slippage • The US$ index recouped 98.0 levels to end higher against major currencies. Strength in US equities coupled with rising yields is positive for US$. Chinese Yuan has appreciated towards 6.97 levels yesterday amid news that the US and China may work towards reducing tariffs on a proportionate basis. This is mildly positive for EM currencies, including rupee.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Benchmark yield</b>
      </p>
      <p>Domestic benchmark 10-year yields ended higher at 6.52% in the previous session. Domestic GST collections for October were at Rs 95380 crore, down 5.29% on a YoY basis • The US 10-year benchmark yields extended further gains to close at 1.86% in the previous session. Risk sentiments improved supported by overall strength in US equities while a sharper rally in yields could be a signal that the US economy is relatively preforming well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Currency futures on NSE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The dollar-rupee November contract on the NSE was at 71.04 in the previous session. Open interest increased 7.67% in the previous session • We expect the US$INR to find supports at lower levels. Utilise downsides in the pair to initiate long positions.</p>
