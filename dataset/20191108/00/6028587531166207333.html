      <p>It’s Friday! And to make your weekend just a tiny bit more enjoyable, Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford has handed out yet another SHiFT code. Now you can go get some free epic or legendary loot this weekend if you’re still playing <i>Borderlands 3. </i>There are so many new games out right now, it’s honestly hard to keep up!In any case, here’s the code. It will remain active until 10 am CST tomorrow, Saturday November 9th. That’s a good long while.</p>
      <p>W95BB-3BZS3-ZCBWC-BJT3B-9BTKS</p>
      <p>As far as I know, this works on every platform–consoles and PC alike. You can redeem it in-game <a href="https://t.co/qeoZfch3Wu?amp=1">or at this website.</a></p>
      <p>Once you redeem it you’ll get a Golden Key which can be used at the big chest in Sanctuary. Drop rates for legendaries are still . . . not great, and I think Gearbox would get a little more hype going around these codes if they buffed legendary drops instead of handing out epics like Halloween candy. Don’t give out as many SHiFT codes, but make the rewards better. Or have each code grant three Golden Keys maybe.</p>
      <p>Players have also complained that they’re running out of storage for all this loot, which could be something of a problem. So more storage, better drops, and we’re golden.</p>
      <p>Happy vault hunting!</p>
