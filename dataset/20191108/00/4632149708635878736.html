      <p>In keeping with tightening security measures, the Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) plans to deliver its question paper through Virtual Private Network (VPN) and has asked its colleges to dedicate a separate computer system, smart mobile phone and CCTV cameras for safe delivery of papers. <br/><br/><br/>As colleges are finding it difficult to bear the cost, the State Department of Technical Education will shoulder the expenses. This comes after, a government engineering college from Kushalnagar wrote to the director of technical education that it needs to buy computer, networking facility and smartphone and requested the department to provide it with Rs. 1,50,000 for this. <br/><br/>The department agreed and asked all the government engineering colleges to follow the same procedure. An official from the technical education department said, “The VTU is following this system to ensure the safe and secure transport of question papers.” <br/><br/><br/>The colleges should set up all the facilities by mid-October and send a report to the university before the examination department executes the work for the upcoming semester examinations.</p>
