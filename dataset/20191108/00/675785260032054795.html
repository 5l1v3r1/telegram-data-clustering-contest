      <p>Suspected bloodstains were cleaned from the floor where backpacker Grace Millane was allegedly murdered, a court heard.</p>
      <p>An expert gave details about the gruesome discovery during the trial of a 27-year-old man accused of killing the British woman in New Zealand.Â </p>
      <p>Scientist Dianne Crenfeldt, from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research, told the jury she had found two approximately circular probable blood stains.</p>
      <p>She told Auckland High Court they were found between the bed and a wardrobe where the man accused of Grace's murder was staying.</p>
      <p>The smaller of the stains was more circular and "could have come from a bucket", Ms Crenfeldt said.</p>
      <p>She added: "The shape of the probable blood staining and the presence of blood on the floor provided strong support that clean up of blood had occurred in this area."</p>

      <p>The Crown has alleged the defendant, who cannot be named due to a suppression order, murdered the young woman from Wickford, Essex.</p>
      <p>He is accused of shoving her body inside a suitcase before burying her in a forested area outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>The defence claims the death, on either December 1 or December 2, 2018, the date of Grace's twenty second birthday, was accidental.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, security footage played for the jury showed Grace, who was on a round-the-world trip, visiting a number of bars in the city centre with the accused, where they drank alcohol.</p>
      <p>Her friend Ameena Ashcroft, said she "thought something was out of place" when the young woman sent a series of messages on December 1.</p>
      <p>Grace described wanting to "get smashed" with the man she had met on Tinder.</p>

      <p>Security footage showed the pair kiss repeatedly at the Bluestone Room before walking arm-in-arm a short distance into the lobby of the CityHigh hotel, where the defendant was staying.</p>
      <p>Grace was shown to follow the defendant out of the lift at 9.41pm.</p>
      <p>It was the last time she was seen alive.</p>
      <p>Her mother Gillian left the court in tears as detective Samuel Luker described a series of photographs found on the defendant's phone yesterday.</p>

      <p>The defendant, wearing a navy blue suit and black shirt, did not react as Mrs Millane walked out of the courtroom.</p>
      <p>Data from the man's phone showed he had used Google to browse websites for large duffel bags, suitcases and car hire.</p>
      <p>The defendant's phone was also used to search for "flesh-eating birds" and "are there vultures in New Zealand?" days later, on December 5 2018.</p>
      <p>The trial, expected to last five weeks, continues.</p>
