      <h1>Doctors Announce First Ever “Fully Functional” Penis Transplant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <p>The anonymous injured veteran who got a <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/penis-transplant-surgery">full penis and scrotum transplant</a> remains in good health — and it sounds as though the new genitals are working just fine.</p>
      <p>“He has near-normal erections and the ability to achieve orgasm,” the researchers <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1907956">wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>Last year, the veteran reported a vast improvement to his self-confidence after the penis transplant, which was a world-first because it included the scrotum and surrounding tissue.</p>
      <p>“When I first woke up [after the procedure], I felt finally more normal… [with] a level of confidence as well… like finally I’m okay now,” he said at the time.</p>
      <p>Sometimes transplants go bad — the recipient’s immune system can reject and attack the new organ, for instance. But that <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-s-first-penis-and-scrotum-transplant-is-a-total-success-one-year-on">didn’t happen this time</a>. The Johns Hopkins University doctors who performed the procedure report that the veteran maintains “near-normal sexual function and major improvement in quality-of-life measures” in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1907956">research published Thursday</a> in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p>
      <p>“He reports an improved self-image and ‘feeling whole’ again and states that he is very satisfied with the transplant and the implications it carries for his future,” the researchers wrote.</p>
      <p>The veteran can also use the restroom without additional complications. And no matter how much the doctors wax philosophically about his romantic prospects, as one did in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/23/i-performed-worlds-first-penis-and-scrotum-transplant">op-ed for <i>The Guardian</i></a>, it suggests that the new medical procedure can restore normalcy to daily life for people facing unfortunately-stigmatized medical issues.</p>
