      <h1>USOPC to add athlete reps in wake of Nassar sex abuse</h1>

      <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee will add athletes to its board and enhance its oversight of individual sports organizations in a package of reforms stemming from the Larry Nassar sex-abuse scandal.</p>
      <p>The reforms were approved Thursday and go into effect in January. They come with Congress proposing its own, harsher, set of changes , after the scandal exposed the USOPC as deficient when it came to protecting and ensuring the safety of Olympic athletes.</p>
      <p>Athletes will hold 33 percent of the board seats. The U.S. Olympians and Paralympians Association and Athletes Advisory Council will collaborate to choose the leaders.</p>
      <p>The USOPC will have more power of policing national governing bodies.</p>

        <p>An issue in the Nassar case was whether the USOPC was directly responsible for gymnasts or if responsibility was solely within USA Gymnastics, which is where Nassar worked as a volunteer doctor.</p>
