      <p>VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A Lithuanian court has remanded in custody for two months a former judge wanted in connection with claims she made about a pedophile ring in Lithuania.</p>
      <p>Friday’s ruling by the Kaunas district court was in line with the prosecution’s request as Neringa Venckiene, 48, was considered a flight risk given that her son resides in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Venckiene, who was extradited back to Lithuania from Chicago on Tuesday, is accused of submitting false reports regarding the existence of the pedophile ring.</p>
      <p>Venckiene says the accusations are politically motivated.</p>
      <p>Venckiene fled Lithuania in 2013 after receiving death threats. She and her son sought political asylum there.</p>
