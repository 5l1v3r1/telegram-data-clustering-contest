      <p>Baker County commissioners asked the public last month if they could attend the funeral service for Michael Allevato. </p>
      <p>A crowd gathered with their heads bowed, surrounding a small urn with an American Flag at the Jacksonville National Cemetery. </p>
      <p>Veterans came from all over to give one of their own a final salute. </p>
      <p>Michael Allevato was an Army veteran from Baker County. </p>
      <p>He was only 67 years old when he died in 2017. </p>
      <p>“I seen on Facebook that the veteran had passed away and didn’t have friends and family,” Esteban Soto, an Army veteran, <a href="https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/hundreds-help-say-goodbye-to-a-local-army-veteran-without-family/1006178288">said</a>.</p>
      <p>Soto drove an hour and a half from Palm Coast to pay his respects. </p>
      <p>“Even though he might not have had anybody in the past, his brothers and sisters are all with him right now," Soto <a href="https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/hundreds-help-say-goodbye-to-a-local-army-veteran-without-family/1006178288">said</a>.</p>
      <p>The Baker County Board of Commissioners told us they tried for two years to find Allevato's family or friends, but they didn’t have any luck.</p>
      <p>The Baker County Veterans Service Office took over and was able to help set up a plot at the Jacksonville National Cemetery. </p>
      <p>Baker County Commission Chair Cathy Rhoden says it was overwhelming to see all the support, and not just from her county. </p>
      <p>“He had no blood family, but today he had family, and that really means a lot to us,” Rhoden <a href="https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/hundreds-help-say-goodbye-to-a-local-army-veteran-without-family/1006178288">said</a>. </p>
      <p>During the ceremony, the American the flag was folded by active duty service members and given to Baker County commissioners. </p>
      <p>That flag will head back to Baker County where it can proudly be displayed so Allevato is never forgotten. </p>
