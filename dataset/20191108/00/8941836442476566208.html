      <h1>WeWork to sell MeetUp, cut jobs in 90-day turnaround plan</h1>

      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wework/">WeWork</a> said Friday it will divest from several side businesses and cut jobs as part of a 90-day plan to turn itself around following its botched attempt to sell stock on Wall Street.</p>
      <p>The office-sharing company will divest from five non-core businesses, including Meetup, the online community event organizer that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wework/">WeWork</a> bought in 2017, according to a newly released presentation first shared privately with investors in October. It will also sell its stake in women’s co-working company The Wing.</p>
      <p>An unspecified number of job cuts will target administrative employees, those working in growth-related positions and those at ventures the company expects to scale back. Layoffs will not include “community teams” based within its shared office sites.</p>
      <p>The document shows <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wework/">WeWork</a> was still working to grow rapidly as its initial public stock offering unraveled in September, a crisis that left the company on the brink of bankruptcy and forced the ouster of co-founder <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-neumann/">Adam Neumann</a>.</p>
      <p>In the third quarter of 2019, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wework/">WeWork</a> added a record 108,000 desks at newly built shared offices, leaving it now with substantially more space to fill even as it pursues a painful restructuring. The newly added desks led to a slight dip in its average occupancy rate to 80%, compared to 83% the previous quarter.</p>

      <p>New York-based <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wework/">WeWork</a> now has 580,000 members in 600 locations across 122 cities in 32 countries. The company said 43% of its members are larger companies with more than 500 employees. Its future strategy will focus on shoring up that clientele, which commits to longer-team leases that provide a steadier revenue stream.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wework/">WeWork</a>’s planned IPO collapsed after investors balked at losses that grew to nearly $2 billion year and at the company’s business model that offered no clear path to profitability.</p>
      <p>It escaped possible bankruptcy with a $9.5 billion bailout from Japanese tech conglomerate Softbank, which took an 80% stake in the company. About $3 billion went to buying shares from stakeholders including co-founder <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-neumann/">Neumann</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wework/">WeWork</a> laid out a plan to focus on its core office-leasing operations and away from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-neumann/">Neumann</a>’s scattered vision, which included investing in Spanish wave-pool startup Wavegarden, an apparent reflection of his love of surfing. The stake in Wavegarden is now up for sale.</p>

        <p>In an apparent reference to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-neumann/">Neumann</a>, the company said it is moving away from a “founder-led” leadership and toward “proven executives in membership focused, subscription-based businesses.”</p>
