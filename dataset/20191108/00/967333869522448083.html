      <blockquote>The biggest US-based clothing retailer <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/07/gap-ceo-art-peck-to-step-down.html">did not provide</a> further detail on the reasons for Peck's resignation after serving as CEO since 2015 and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201601041032655685-china-exchange-plummet/">working at the Gap</a> for almost 15 years.</blockquote>
      <p>The company said, however, that Robert Fisher - a Gap founder and currently the company’s non-executive chairman - <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/20140228187973209-Shares-of-Russian-Metals-Giant-Mechel-Plummet-25/">will serve as CEO</a> on an interim basis.</p>
      <p>Gap's shares plummeted <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201601171033283859-saudi-plummet-iran-rise/">over 9 percent</a> on Thursday on the news of Peck's sudden resignation.</p>
