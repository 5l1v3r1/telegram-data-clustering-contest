      <p>NEW ORLEANS (AP) - A now-40-year-old man is accused of raping an 11-year-old New Orleans girl nearly two decades ago.</p>
      <p>A release from District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro’s office says a grand jury on Thursday charged Andre Reddic with aggravated rape and aggravated kidnapping. An aggravated rape conviction would carry a mandatory life sentence.</p>
      <p>The girl told police two strangers harassed her, grabbed her, dragged her into a backyard and raped her at knifepoint on Sept. 11, 2000.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say DNA from the case was flagged in a federal database in 2004 as a likely match with Reddic’s. They say a cheek swab confirmed the match in March.</p>
      <p>District attorney’s spokesman Ken Daley said he wasn’t sure of Reddic’s hometown or whether he had an attorney.</p>
