      <p>The outlook partly reflects the ineffectiveness of the government and its policy in addressing economic weakness, which led to an increase in debt burden from already-high levels, the rating agency said.</p>
      <p>India’s economy grew only 5 percent year-on-year (YoY) between April and June, its weakest pace since 2013, as consumer demand and government spending slowed amid global trade frictions.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
