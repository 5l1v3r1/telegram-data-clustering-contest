      <p>PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) - CJ Elleby scored a career-high 27 points and Washington State overpowered <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle/">Seattle</a> 85-54 Thursday night</p>
      <p>Washington State looked strong on both sides of the ball in its season opener under new head coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kyle-smith/">Kyle Smith</a>.</p>
      <p>The Cougars had only three turnovers and led the entire game, shooting 41%, and outscored <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle/">Seattle</a> 32-22 in the paint.</p>
      <p>“We just did a great job wire to wire and we have to feel great about that,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kyle-smith/">Smith</a> said. “We talk about three things: defending, rebounding and taking care of the ball. If you only turn the ball over three times you are always going to give yourself a chance.”</p>
      <p>Elleby had an impressive performance, shooting 12 of 18 from the field and grabbing seven rebounds.</p>

      <p>“The way we play right now has a lot to do with the chemistry we built over the summer and fall,” Elleby said. “I am just really comfortable out there with my teammates. They know where I like the ball and it was just easy.”</p>
      <p>Issac Bonton added 12 points, seven rebounds and four assists.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle/">Seattle</a> (1-1) struggled with a stifling defensive effort by the Cougars. Washington State forced 19 points off turnovers and held the Redhawks to just 36% shooting, including 1 of 13 from the 3-point line.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t see that rotten egg coming. Just really disappointed,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle/">Seattle</a> head coach Jim Hayford. “We laid down and 10 points got to 20 points and the rest of the game we just kind of went through the motions.”</p>

        <p>Terrell Brown had 24 points and 10 rebounds for the Redhawks.</p>
        <p>“I thought Terrell played his heart out for us,” Hayford said. “He is going to need a lot of help from our other guys. We play a really good team on Saturday so if we don’t get our act together we are going to get another serving of this.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle/">Seattle</a>: The Redhawks were overpowered on both ends of the floor.</p>
        <p>Washington State: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kyle-smith/">Smith</a>’s offseason focus on defensive principles paid off for the Cougars. With Elleby, a Wooden Award watch list candidate, at the helm and an influx of new talent, the Cougars could be an underdog to watch in the Pac-12.</p>
        <p>NEW FACES</p>
        <p>The Cougars return five players from 2018-19 and add 12 newcomers under <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kyle-smith/">Smith</a>, who came to WSU after three seasons leading the San Francisco program.</p>
        <p>DEFENSIVE FOCUS</p>
        <p>Only once during the 2018-2019 season in an 80-52 victory over Delaware State did the Cougars hold a team to fewer points than they did tonight.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle/">Seattle</a> travels to play Eastern Washington in Cheney on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Washington State travels to California to take on Santa Clara on Tuesday.</p>
