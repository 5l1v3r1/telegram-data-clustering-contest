      <p>A former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> MP has confirmed he will run as an independent in the general election after the party withdrew its support for him after he backed protesters in an LGBT teaching row.</p>
      <p>Roger Godsiff, 73, who had been the Labour MP for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham">Birmingham</a> Hall Green, was told this week by the national executive committee (NEC) that he would not be endorsed as a candidate in the December poll and someone else would run in his place.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Godsiff announced he would run for election in his former constituency as an Independent Labour candidate.</p>
      <p>He said that “a small intolerant vindictive group within the LGBT community” had carried out a “vicious and vindictive campaign of character assassination against me using social media and misinformation to stir up a witch-hunt”.</p>
      <p>The constituency is home to Anderton Park primary school, which was at the centre of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/21/lgbt-lessons-police-chief-calls-end-birmingham-protests-schools">series of school gate protests</a> earlier this year. It led to a court injunction banning demonstrations inside an exclusion zone around the site.</p>
      <p>Godsiff was criticised after telling protesters they had a “just cause”. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, reported the “discriminatory and irresponsible” comments to the chief whip, Nick Brown.</p>
      <p>He was then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/09/labour-mp-criticised-for-siding-with-birmingham-school-protesters">reprimanded by the chief whip</a> and instructed not to repeat his comments.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Godsiff said: “I have always put the interests of my constituents above everything else and I don’t succumb to threats. I have supported the rights of parents to have a say, not a veto, over how the most sensitive aspects of the Equality Act are taught to young children.”</p>
