      <p><b>Topline</b>: Alibaba is gearing up for a share offering in Hong Kong later this month as it looks to raise up to $15 billion in a secondary listing. The move would be a boost for the financial hub rocked by months of unrest that have tipped it into <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-economy-gdp/hong-kong-falls-into-first-recession-in-10-years-as-protests-trade-war-weigh-idUSKBN1XA112">recession</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Chinese e-commerce firm reportedly sought approval from Hong Kong’s listing committee on Thursday, according to <i>Reuters</i>, which cited two people familiar with discussions. The company is expected to undergo the listing process from November 25, although Alibaba has not confirmed timings.</li>
        <li>According to analysts cited by <i>Reuters</i>, who first reported the move, it would be the biggest cross-border listing ever recorded. The $480 billion giant is no stranger to records—its $25 billion initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 was the biggest ever.</li>
        <li>Analysts say the move could be an effort to hedge against the U.S.-China trade war that has hit the Chinese economy and led to its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/yuwahedrickwong/2019/07/15/chinas-economy-grows-at-slowest-pace-in-nearly-30-years-but-is-the-trade-war-to-blame/#263ce1693ee0">slowest growth</a> in almost 30 years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Alibaba has been planning its listing in Hong Kong for months, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-listing-exclusive/exclusive-alibaba-postpones-up-to-15-billion-hong-kong-listing-amid-protests-sources-idUSKCN1VB06S">pulled back</a> in August amid unrelenting protests. The unrest has resulted in Hong Kong’s economy shrinking for two straight quarters, with GDP falling by 3.2% in the three months to September. Retailers are among firms that have been<a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3027528/several-dozen-hong-kong-retailers-likely-fold-leaving-thousands"> impacted</a> the most while, in contrast, Alibaba reported a 40% growth in revenue in its second quarter to nearly $17 billion.</p>
      <p><b>Additional fact</b>: The listing would come after Singles Day on November 11, Alibaba’s biggest trading day and mainland China’s biggest shopping day. The firm made $30 billion last year in the event.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent</b>: On Thursday, 22-year-old student Alex Chow died after he fell from a car parking lot on Monday amid a police operation in the area. His death, the first student death linked with the pro-democracy demonstrations, sparked vigils and fresh protests in Hong Kong. The financial hub is reeling from the impact of the five-month-long protests, police crackdowns and violent clashes between police and protesters. The protest movement emerged out of opposition to a now scrapped extradition bill with China but has morphed into a broader campaign for democratic and police reform in the city.</p>
