      <h1>‘Last Supper’ Painting Found Shot By Air Rifle, With Jesus Being The Target</h1>

      <p><b>A modern painting</b> of <i>The Last Supper</i> was found with a mysterious hole, with the artist’s interpretation of Jesus Christ having been “shot.” <br/><b>The vandalism was</b> spotted when the piece, created by renowned portrait artist Lorna May Wadsworth, was being prepared for display at the Graves Gallery in Sheffield for a retrospective of the Wadsworth’s work. <br/><b>It was previously</b> showcased at a Gloucestershire country church for a decade, but nobody had noticed if it was already punctured then. <br/><b>A ballistics expert</b> deemed the “bullet hole” to have come from an air rifle, and that Christ, depicted by the artist as black, was hit with a pellet. <br/><b>The artist expressed</b> her dismay at the malicious move, as it looked to her that “someone was so aggrieved by my portrayal of Christ that they wanted to attack it,” she told <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/06/artist-lorna-may-wadsworth-discovers-bullet-hole-in-jesus-in-last-supper-painting?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">The Guardian</a></i>.  <br/><b>Wadsworth also described</b> the act to be “iconoclastic,” since her portrayal of Christ was inspired by fashion model Tafari Hinds. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The artist used</b> the model’s image as Christ to challenge perceptions, inviting people to look at something “you think you know” with a brand new set of eyes. <br/><b>Wadsworth pointed out</b> that the pellet hole was positioned on Jesus’s right side, possibly signifying the final wound he had received from a Roman solder while hanging on the cross. <br/><b>Some have wondered</b> if the act was driven by racial motives, but Wadsworth hopes that it “was just mindless vandalism.” <br/><b>Despite the discovery,</b> the Graves Gallery will host the retrospective of Wadsworth’s work titled <i>GAZE</i> at the artist’s hometown at Sheffield from 9 November 2019 to 15 February 2020.
