      <p><b>But it really doesn’t.</b> Luxury automaker Jaguar has unveiled the Jaguar Vision Gran Turismo Coupé, its first-ever virtual all-electric sports car. The experimental vehicle encapsulates the “truly limitless” ideas of designers at Jaguar as well as its heritage. <br/><b>The Vision Gran Turismo Coupé</b> isn’t a real car, and as its name suggests, will only exist in Sony PlayStation 4’s <i>Gran Turismo Sport</i> game. The exclusion of physical limitations meant designers could imagine a hypercar from the ground up with “complete creative freedom,” Jaguar explains in a press release. <br/><b>The futuristic all-electric,</b> all-wheel concept combines the designs of Jaguar’s C-type and D-type race cars, and is built with three powerful motors producing 750 kW. Drivers in the game will be able to race at 100km/h (62mph) in under two seconds. <br/><b>It also has</b> an unreal sheen and perfect proportions, as well as weighs just 1,400kg (3,086lb) with an almost 50:50 weight distribution. This is all thanks to its makeup of experimental lightweight materials like advanced aluminum alloys and airy but stiff monocoque from carbon-fiber composites. <br/><b>Jaguar’s young designers</b> had full control over the project, says design director Julian Thomson, who describes it as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for them to create a vehicle steeped in our incredible heritage but pushing the boundaries of future design.” <br/><b>“The team have done</b> an incredible job in creating something which is clearly identifiable as a Jaguar, inspired—but not constrained—by our iconic past.” <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The electric vehicle’s</b> interior also intertwines Jaguar’s heritage with its interior design ethos of “progressive luxury, purity, driver focus, and stunningly intricate details” while remaining simplistic, Jaguar adds. <br/><b>“We’ve really pushed</b> the limit to imagine how a future Jaguar sports car interior could look,” Jaguar Advanced Design’s interior designer Chris Shaw explains. “The architecture is visually lightweight, simple, and dramatic; featuring advanced and experimental materials and finishes.” Players will be “fully immersed in the action” with the “unmistakably Jaguar” design, Shaw elaborates. <br/><b>Gamers can give</b> the car a test drive and more in end November 2019, when it will be available for download in Sony PlayStation 4’s <i>Gran Turismo Sport</i>.</p>
