      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The Tennessee Titans won’t have starting defensive tackle Jurrell Casey or linebacker Jayon Brown when they face Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Titans announced Friday that Casey (shoulder) and Brown (groin) won’t play against the Chiefs. This will be the second straight game Casey has missed. He didn’t play in a 30-20 loss to the Carolina Panthers.</p>
      <p>Those injuries are the latest setbacks for a Titans defense that already lost cornerback Malcolm Butler, who was placed on injured reserve this week after he injured his left wrist at Carolina.</p>
      <p>Mahomes, the NFL MVP, is expected to start against the Titans after missing two games with a dislocated kneecap.</p>
      <p>Titans tight end Delanie Walker (ankle) also won’t play against the Chiefs.</p>
