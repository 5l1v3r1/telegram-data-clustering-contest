      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) - A convicted Maryland pimp has been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.</p>
      <p>The office of the U.S. Attorney in Maryland says 26-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ryan-russell-parks/">Ryan Russell Parks</a> was sentenced Thursday. The Baltimore resident was also ordered to five years of supervised release following his prison term and to register as a sex offender.</p>
      <p>Federal authorities accused <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ryan-russell-parks/">Parks</a> of trafficking two girls ages 15 and 16 in 2017. Authorities say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ryan-russell-parks/">Parks</a> marketed the girls online to draw men to a Baltimore motel and set prices and time limits for the sex acts.</p>
      <p>A jury in July convicted <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ryan-russell-parks/">Parks</a> on two counts of sex trafficking of a minor and one count of using the internet to promote an enterprise involving prostitution.</p>
