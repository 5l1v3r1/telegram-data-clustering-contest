      <p>Happy Friday from Mud Run Guide! It's time to check in with the OCR Community to see what they've been up to.</p>
      <p>This week, we are flashing back to Spartan's Trifecta Championships in Greece. Michael Cayer may not have had the race he had trained for due to injuries, but he still got out there and made it happen. Congratulations, Michael!</p>

      <p>Finally, we're looking at the future of OCR! Kevin Kleinkort's daughter is only 4 months old and she's already sporting a Spartan headband. Before you know it, she'll be tearing up the monkey bars in preparation for some Spartan Kids races!</p>
