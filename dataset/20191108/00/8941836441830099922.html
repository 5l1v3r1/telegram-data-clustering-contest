      <p>OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) - The Baltimore Ravens have signed inside linebacker <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lj-fort/">L.J. Fort</a> to a two-year extension through 2021.</p>
      <p>Fort was signed to Baltimore’s 53-man roster in late September after being released by the Eagles. He played the previous four seasons with Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Fort was used exclusively on special team with Philadelphia but has become a key contributor on the Baltimore defense. Over four games with the Ravens, he has 14 tackles and a sack.</p>
      <p>Fort played 56 snaps in a 30-16 win at Seattle on Oct. 20 and had three tackles in last Sunday’s victory over previously unbeaten New England.</p>
      <p>Fort broke into the NFL with Cleveland in 2012. He has 71 tackles and four sacks over 69 games, including six starts.</p>
