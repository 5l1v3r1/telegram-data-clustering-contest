      <p>In this week's roundup: Firefox gains locksmith-like powers, Samsung's Galaxy Store starts supporting Progressive Web Apps, CSS Subgrid is shipping in Firefox 70, and a new study confirms that users prefer to tap into content rather than scroll through it.</p>
      <p>Let's get into the news.</p>
      <h3>Securely generated passwords in Firefox</h3>
      <p>Firefox now suggests a securely generated password when the user focuses an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element that has the <code>autocomplete="new-password"</code> attribute value. This option is also available via the context menu on any password field.</p>

      <h3>Web apps in Samsung’s app store</h3>
      <p>Samsung has started adding Progressive Web Apps (PWA) to its app store, Samsung Galaxy Store, which is available on Samsung devices. The new “Web apps” category is visible initially only in the United States. If you own a PWA, you can send its URL to pwasupport@samsung.com, and Samsung will help you get onboarded into Galaxy Store.</p>

      <h3>Tappable stories on the mobile web</h3>
      <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UUy80FNr04gUNkt4qIw5hxkmWNffysPO/view">According to a study</a> commissioned by Google, the majority of people prefer <a href="https://tappable.co/">tappable stories</a> over scrolling articles when consuming content on the mobile web. Google is using this study to promote AMP Stories, which is a format for tappable stories on the mobile web.</p>
      <blockquote>Both studies had participants interact with real-world examples of tappable stories on the mobile web as well as scrolling article equivalents. Forrester found that 64% of respondents preferred the tappable mobile web story format over its scrolling article equivalent.</blockquote>

      <h3>The grid form use-case for CSS Subgrid</h3>
      <p>CSS Subgrid is shipping in Firefox next month. This new feature enables grid items of nested grids to be put onto the outer grid, which is useful in situations where the wanted grid items are not direct children of the grid container.</p>
