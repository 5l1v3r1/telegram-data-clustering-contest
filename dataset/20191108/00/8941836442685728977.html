      <p>BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Nobel laurate <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/peter-handke/">Peter Handke</a> has admitted that he had a Yugoslav passport in the 1990s, as Austrian authorities launched an investigation into whether he legally held on to his Austrian citizenship after obtaining the travel document.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/peter-handke/">Handke</a>, who won the Nobel Prize for literature this year, told Belgrade newspaper <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vecernje-novosti/">Vecernje Novosti</a> on Friday that he “got the passport to travel.”</p>
      <p>Since Serbia and Montenegro split apart in 2006, Yugoslav passports are no longer valid.</p>
      <p>Authorities in Austria’s Carinthia province have opened an investigation into the matter. Austrians taking another citizenship need to secure permission to keep their Austrian nationality.</p>
