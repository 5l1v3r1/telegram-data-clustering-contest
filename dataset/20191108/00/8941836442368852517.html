      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - Jeff Maggert shot a 6-under 65 on Friday to increase his lead to four strokes in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-schwab-corp/">Charles Schwab</a> Cup Championship, with Bernhard Langer second in a bid for his record sixth PGA Tour Champions season points title.</p>
      <p>Maggert birdied three of the first four holes in a front-nine 31 and capped the bogey-free round with a birdie on the par-4 17th in perfect conditions at Phoenix Country Club. He had a 14-under 128 total.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old Texan entered the season-ending event 34th in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-schwab-corp/">Charles Schwab</a> Cup standings, just three spots from failing to qualify. He won three times on the PGA Tour and has five senior victories, one in 2014 and four in 2015.</p>
      <p>Langer closed with a double bogey after hitting his approach into the water on the par-5 18th. Coming off a playoff loss to Colin Montgomerie on Sunday in California, Langer is third in the standings behind Scott McCarron and Jerry Kelly.</p>
      <p>To take the season title, the 62-year-old German star needs to win the event and have McCarron finish in a two-way tie for fifth or worse and Kelly finish in a two-way tie for second or worse. McCarron (71) and Kelly (74) were tied for 25th at 2 under.</p>
