      <h3>Use maps offline</h3>
      <p><b>It can get inconvenient</b> when your phone loses signal during your travels. Fortunately, there is a function on the app that allows users to download routes beforehand. <br/><b>To activate offline maps,</b> simply enter your destination, tap the address of the site and then the three-dot menu at the upper-right corner. <br/><b>Then, select</b> download offline map and you can now access the map for your destination even when offline.</p>
      <h3>Find parking spots</h3>
      <p><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The need</b> to find a parking spot can be especially important when you’re running late. To use the app for help finding parking spots, simply enter your present location, tap on Directions and then the P icon that sits next to the estimated time of arrival. The icon either shows up as red, to indicate difficulty to find a parking spot, or blue for relative ease. <br/><b>You will</b> be shown a list of parking spots available, and upon selection you can slot the parking allocation as the first stop of your journey.</p>
      <h3>See what the place looks like</h3>
      <p><b>Pictures themselves</b> may not suffice when it comes to knowing what the surroundings of your destination looks like, so you can enter your location and then tap on the photograph of the place to have a better view. <br/><b>From there,</b> you can zoom in and out of the visual, as well as move around for a fuller street view of the location. <br/><b>Check out</b> two more Google Maps tricks on <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/5-hidden-google-maps-tricks-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>CNET</i></a>‘s article to further aid your future travels. <br/>[via <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/5-hidden-google-maps-tricks-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">CNET</a>, cover image via <a href="https://shutterstock.7eer.net/c/1262811/42119/1305?u=https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/penang-malaysia-july-12-2017-female-1031361958">AngieYeoh / Shutterstock.com</a>]</p>
