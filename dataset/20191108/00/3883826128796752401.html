        <b>Steven Gerrard lauded Rangers' win over Porto as "being right up there" with the best of his managerial career after a special Europa League night at Ibrox.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese side - quarter-finalists in last year's Champions League - were humbled 2-0 by Gerrard's men after being held 1-1 at home two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Rangers sit level with leaders Young Boys after four games, with Gerrard yet to taste defeat at home in Europe.</p>
      <p>"We beat a good team tonight and we've beaten them comfortably," he said.</p>
      <p>"They have good players and over two games we have dominated three halves.</p>

      <p>"I thought Porto paid us a big compliment with their set-up, the formation and the personnel they picked.</p>
      <p>"It caused us problems and for the first 20-30 minutes their quick movement and system rattled us a bit. But once we came to terms with it we grew into the game."</p>
      <p>The game turned midway through the second half thanks to Alfredo Morelos' 11th European goal of the season, with the Colombian also providing an assist moments later for Steven Davis.</p>
      <p>Morelos now sits on 21 goals from 25 games this term.</p>
      <p>"That's the reason we talk about him every two or three days," said Gerrard, who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50283438">insisted on Sunday</a> the 23-year-old would not be sold in January.</p>
      <p>"We'll never run out of things to say if he keeps providing performances and moments like that. Players who keep producing moments like that deserve praise.</p>
      <p>"I will never get bored of talking about him. He is a top player and I can't describe how much I enjoy working with him. He's a massive, massive asset to this club."</p>
      <p>Rangers now travel to Rotterdam to take on Feyenoord, knowing a victory would secure their place in the knockout stage of the tournament.</p>
      <p>"It puts us in a good place in the group but still a lot of work to do, two tough games to go," said Gerrard.</p>
      <p>"It's a fantastic carrot for us. It will be really tough. They have a new manager [Dick Advocaat] now, I'm sure there will be a bounce. We will have a game plan, we will work on it."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Porto boss Sergio Conceicao bemoaned an injury which forced experienced defender Pepe off early in the second half.</p>
      <p>"Rangers took advantage of our fragility," he said. "The first half was fairly balanced and I thought it was going OK. However, Pepe's injury affected the result."</p>

      <h3>'A great night for Scottish football' - analysis</h3>

      <p>I was there at the start of that run that took Rangers to the Uefa Cup final. We didn't start that season thinking 'we're going to get to the final'. I just remember it all happening and Walter Smith started taking it seriously. I'm not saying Rangers or Celtic are going to get to a final but that's where it starts. When you start defeating teams like Lazio and Porto then you begin to believe.</p>

      <p>I think the Old Firm are in a really good place at the moment. They're so finely balanced but I like that there's a bit of a swagger about both sides. To come and get results like they did tonight in European football is brilliant and it can't be overstated how good a night this is for Scottish football. We've done a number on two very good teams.</p>
