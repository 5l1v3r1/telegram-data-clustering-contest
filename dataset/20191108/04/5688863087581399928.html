        <b>Yuzvendra Chahal has said that he bears no “hard feelings” towards Rishabh Pant, who had a torrid time behind the stumps in India’s win over Bangladesh yesterday. The leggie also revealed that he practices with wet balls so as to negate the impact of dew when he turns up in a game.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With Bangladesh getting off to a great start and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/khaleel">Khaleel</a> Ahmed struggling with the ball, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> decided to hand the ball to his main wicket taker in the last over of the powerplay. Chahal got off to a brilliant start and even managed to outfox Liton Das to get him stumped by <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pant">Pant</a>. However, the young keeper made a rookie mistake of collecting the ball in front of the stumps and handed Das an extra life. </p>
      <p>Even though the Bangladesh man smashed Chahal for back to back boundaries post the Pant blunder, the leggie revealed that he bore no ill will towards his keeper. </p>
      <p>“We are team players, even I drop catches sometimes, so no one wants to miss a catch or stumping, so no hard feelings with Pant. Just hard luck,” Chahal said after the game, reported Cricinfo.</p>
      <p>Chahal appeared to be in the zone throughout the first innings as he had the Bangladesh batsman dancing to his tunes. What made the performance, where he finished with 2/28 in his four overs, impressive was the fact that the outfield was wet which usually has an impact on ball control for leg spinners. However, Chahal was consistent throughout and went on to reveal his secret to bowling in wet conditions. </p>
      <p>"When I bowled my first ball, I realised that it's spinning. You have to vary your pace here. When I was not part of the India team, I was practicing with the wet ball, so dew didn't affect me. Knew where to ball,” Chahal revealed.</p>
      <p>“My bowling depends on what I think the batsman is trying to do. Depending on that I bowl the topspinner, googly or slider. Bowling in the death or powerplay gives you more confidence."</p>
