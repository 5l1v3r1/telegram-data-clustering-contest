      <p>A last-gasp Olivier Ntcham goal handed Celtic a ticket to the last-32 stage in the Europa League on Thursday while Munir El Haddadi’s hat-trick ensured Sevilla also go through along with Basle who had Fabian Frei to thank for their winner.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Manchester United, Sevilla and Celtic led a parade of clubs with continental pedigree to book the first places in this season's Europa League knockout stage as they all won on Thursday to reach the last-32.</p>
      <p>But while 2017 winners United and Sevilla, who claimed three successive Europa League titles between 2014-16, advanced with ease, it was the Scots who provided the drama as a last-gasp Olivier Ntcham goal handed them a 2-1 win at Lazio.</p>

      <p>Basle are also into the next stage where the top two in each of the 12 Europa League groups are joined by eight teams dropping out of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>All the qualified teams are through with two games to spare.</p>
      <p>Manchester United teenager Mason Greenwood put the three-time European champions ahead versus Partizan Belgrade at Old Trafford and a superb individual goal from Anthony Martial doubled the lead before halftime.</p>
      <p>Marcus Rashford also scored with a fine strike in the 49th minute to complete a 3-0 victory in Group L and provide relief for under-fire manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>"We needed a win, but we needed a performance. The boys wanted to go forward, play forward, run forward. They could have had loads more tonight as well. But a pleasing performance, and very important for us to get the points," he told reporters.</p>
      <p>United are the only team in this season’s Europa League not to have conceded a goal, even if they gave first choice goalkeeper David de Gea the day off on his 29th birthday.</p>
      <p>A hat-trick for Sevilla's Munir El Haddadi was supplemented by two goals from Munas Dabbur in a 5-2 away drubbing of Luxembourg’s Dudelange as the Spaniards kept up their 100per cent record in Group A after racing into a 4-0 halftime lead.</p>
      <p>Celtic, European champions over a half century ago, advanced from Group E as they fought back to clinch their first victory in Italy, with Frenchman Ntcham chipping oncoming goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha deep in stoppage time for the winner.</p>
      <p>“This team keeps setting new boundaries for itself," said ecstatic manager Neil Lennon. "It’s a historic night and to come here and be as good as that and to have qualified after four games is unheard of for Celtic in Europe."</p>
      <p>FREI WINNER</p>
      <p>Basle's Fabian Frei scored the winner on the hour mark for the Swiss outfit as they beat visiting Getafe 2-1 to go four points clear in Group C and guarantee a top-two finish.</p>
      <p>Paulinho’s first half double set Braga on the way to a 3-1 home win over 10-man Besiktas to keep them top in Group K where Wolverhampton Wanderers missed a penalty and needed a late Raul Jimenez header to win 1-0 against Slovan Bratislava at Molineux.</p>
      <p>PSV Eindhoven missed the chance to put their poor domestic form behind them and also qualify for the last-32 as they let an early lead slip at LASK Linz and eventually lost 4-1.</p>
      <p>Sporting now top Group D after a 2-0 win at hapless Rosenborg to reach nine points, two more than LASK and PSV. The Norwegians have lost all four of their group games.</p>
      <p>Rangers scored twice in four second-half minutes through Alfredo Morelos and Steven Davis to beat Porto 2-0 at Ibrox in Group G, where they are in second place but level on seven points with Swiss champions Young Boys.</p>
      <p>Ghent's 3-1 upset win at VfL Wolfsburg saw the Belgian side go top in Group I, while Espanyol's 6-0 home drubbing of nine-man Ludogorets has them on the cusp of qualifying from Group H.</p>
      <p>The penultimate round of group games will be played on Nov. 28.</p>
