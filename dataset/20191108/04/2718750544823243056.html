      <p>To tease the upcoming <i>Conan Without Borders: Ghana, </i>Team Coco released this clip of Conan O’Brien visiting Ghanaian movie-poster artist Daniel Anum Jasper. The <i>Conan </i>staff asked Jasper to make a poster for the talk show, which he has never seen. It’s a thing of beauty. Never has O’Brien had so many muscles, never has Eisenhower had so much blood coming from his neck stump. With the help of Paul Rudd, the gang even creates the movie that the <i>Conan </i>poster depicts. Fuck Scorsese and Marvel, this is real cinema.</p>
