      <h2>The 42-year-old collapsed after trying to imitate the scene from classic movie Cool Hand Luke starring Paul Newman.</h2>

      <p>A dad-of-four has died after scoffing more than 40 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/food">hard-boiled eggs</a> in a bizarre - and tragic - bet with a friend.</p>
      <p>Subhash Yadav, 42, who was expecting his fifth child, was rushed to hospital but could not be saved - with doctors ruling his death was down to overeating.</p>
      <p>The bet was a tragic copy of a scene in the movie Cool Hand Luke where star Paul Newman accepts an egg-eating bet - but survives.</p>
      <p>Subhash was about to take a bite out of the 42nd one when he dropped to the ground.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>After being rushed to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/hospital">hospital</a> he never regained consciousness and died a few hours later.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/police">Police</a> said that Subhash and his friend had gone to a market area in Jaunpur, India, when an argument broke out between the pair.</p>
      <p>They then challenged each other to eat 50 eggs for 2,000 rupees (£21).</p>
      <p>Subhash accepted the bet and managed to scoff 41 before he collapsed and fell unconscious, reports Gulf News.</p>
      <p>Doctors ruled that his death was due to overeating.</p>
      <p>His family have not publicly commented on the incident.</p>
      <p>Subhash is understood to have had four daughters from his first marriage.</p>
      <p>He married again just nine months ago and was set to became a father for the fifth time.</p>
      <p>Local people who witnessed his collapse rushed him to the district hospital from where he was referred to the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences. He died hours later.</p>
      <p>While the doctors claimed that Subhash died due to over-eating, family members refused to comment on the incident, police added.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a woman blacked out and stopped breathing as she tried to see how many Jaffa Cakes she could fit in her mouth for a party trick.</p>
      <p>Mother-of-one Bethan Gaskin got the snacks lodged in her throat as she desperately tried to spit them out.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old collapsed at home in Bourne, Lincolnshire, on Friday, February 22 and was rushed to hospital.</p>
      <p>The beauty therapist suffered a heart attack and died five days later at Peterborough City Hospital.</p>
      <p>Her devastated adoptive mum Michele spoke out to warn other people of the dangers of extreme food challenges.</p>
      <p>In August Dana Hutchings, 41, collapsed while taking part in the amateur competition at the Fresno Grizzlies stadium in California.</p>
      <p>It is thought he hit his face on a table as he collapsed.</p>
      <p>Medical staff attempted to clear his airway of food but he died less than half an hour after arriving at hospital.</p>
      <p>Witnesses who saw the incident on giant screens said that Mr Hutchings appeared to be eating much quicker than the other contestants.</p>
      <p>In 2017 student Caitlin Nelson, died at a college-sanctioned on-campus pancake eating contest for charity at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, USA.</p>
      <p>She collapsed just minutes into the contest and later died.</p>
