      <p>NEW DELHI: "The magnitude of cash in circulation is directly linked to the level of corruption," Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in his speech on 8 November 2016 that declared that all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes (86% of the currency in circulation then) would no longer be legal tender. While <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Demonetisation">demonetisation</a> did bring down cash usage, it was only temporarily. The total currency in circulation has surpassed pre-demonetisation levels (over Rs 22 trillion compared to Rs 17.7 trillion).</p>
      <p><b>Black money is in the bank?</b> Over 99% of all the demonetised currency notes had returned to the banking system after the drastic move. RBI board that gave its approval for demonetisation had said: "Most of the black money is held not in cash but in the form of real sector assets such as gold or real estate and this move would not have a material impact on the assets."</p>
      <p><b>Fake currency hasn't gone:</b> The RBI board had also said that counterfeiting wasn't a big issue: "While any incidence of counterfeiting is a concern, Rs 400 crore as a percentage of the total quantum of currency in circulation is not very significant."</p>
      <p>The fake new design notes of Rs 500 grew the fastest in 2018-19. The government has stopped printing the Rs 2,000 notes introduced after demonetisation, apparently to prevent easy hoarding and because high-quality fakes have appeared in the market.</p>
      <p><b>Digital march has plateaued:</b> While digital and card payments rose sharply following demonetisation, the growth in number of digital and card transactions is now growing at pre-demonetisation rates. There's also no evidence to suggest that terror funding or corruption has come down because of demonetisation.</p>
      <p><b>And we have a slowdown:</b> While lowering its GDP growth forecast in August, rating agency Crisil had the following reasons behind the current economic slowdown: It started with demonetisation (in November 2016), dealing a severe blow to consumption, leading to a vicious cycle of job loss and lower income, which led to further drop in demand.</p>
      <p>Next shock came in the form of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/gst">GST</a> (in July 2017), which had a knock-on effect on exports growth because of delay in refunds to exporters. Just as the effects of DeMo and GST were petering out, the IL&amp;FS crisis triggered the NBFC credit crunch in 2018.</p>
      <p>At the same time, monetary policy was focused on inflation control, which ensured interest rates remained hard. The government too had little wiggle room to increase its spending to pump-prime the economy given the fiscal deficit target.</p>
