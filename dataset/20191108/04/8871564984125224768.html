      <h1>Princess Ubolratana gets a new flight after complaining about British Airways</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T04:58:59+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 04:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>British Airways said last night it had reached out to the oldest sister of His Majesty the King to rearrange her travel plans after she complained publicly that she was refused access to a flight despite arriving “hours” in advance.</p>
      <p>In a statement sent to the media, British Airways acknowledged the situation and said it had cleared up travel plans with Princess Ubolratana, a colorful royal figure who made a very brief bid to be prime minister earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“We have contacted our customer and reserved her a new flight according to her changed travel plans. The passenger has left on our airline today,” read the statement, which was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCnewsThai/photos/a.1527194487501586/2468759976678361/?type=3&amp;theater">first posted</a> by BBC Thailand.</p>
      <p>Though the statement shed no light on why Ubolratana may have been refused, it seemed to settle an issue that only sprang to attention Thursday morning after the Instagram-prolific princess took to her favorite platform to gripe.</p>
      <p>“Squee! I’m so happy I don’t have to return yet and go back to work. Thank you British Airways for not letting me on your plane, saying that I arrived late, so you wouldn’t load my bags. They said I was too late even though I arrived hours ahead of time,” she wrote on her @Nichax account along with a photo of herself in a London park.</p>
      <p>Ubolratana, 68, added that she was forced to change her flight to the next day. She also expressed concern about missing appointments in Los Angeles.</p>

      <p>“So I went to the park to de-stress but it is so cold,” she concluded the post, with a slew of hashtags including #WhyDidYouTellMeToArriveEarly and #SeeYouTomorrowLa. </p>
      <p>According to palace news, the princess is in London to attend a tourism conference.</p>
      <p>The oldest child of the late King Bhumibol, Ubolratana is no stranger to the spotlight. She stunned the world earlier this year when she <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/breaking-thai-princess-ubolratana-run-pm-thaksin-releated-opposition-ticket/">announced her candidacy for prime minister</a> atop a party linked to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Within hours the king had condemned the as “inappropriate and unconstitutional,” and that was the end of that.</p>
      <p>She’s appeared in several films and founded a drug-education foundation called To Be Number One. But above all, she Instagrams – often with wacky and eccentric results.</p>
      <p>Last week for Halloween, she entertained the kingdom with her many elaborate Halloween costumes, including a photo of her wielding the severed head of a zombie Trump. </p>
