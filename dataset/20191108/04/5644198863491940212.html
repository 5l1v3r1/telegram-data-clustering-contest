      <p>WASHINGTON: An agreement between the United States and China to roll back existing tariffs as part of a 'phase one' trade deal faces fierce internal opposition at the White House and from outside advisers, multiple sources familiar with the talks said.</p>
      <p>The idea of a tariff rollback was not part of the original October “handshake” deal between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. President Donald Trump, these sources said.</p>

      <p>Chinese officials said earlier Thursday that tariff reductions had been agreed, and a U.S. official confirmed that that was the case.</p>
      <p>There is a divide within the administration over whether rolling back tariffs will give away U.S. leverage in the negotiations, the sources said.</p>
