      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Yesterday, we saw a steady rise in ripple above the $0.3000 resistance area against the US Dollar. Moreover, XRP climbed above the $0.3050 and $0.3120 levels.</p>
      <p>However, the $0.3150 area prevented more upsides and a high was formed near $0.3149. As a result, there was a nasty decline below the $0.3050 and $0.3000 support levels. More importantly, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support near $0.3000 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Finally, ripple dived below the $0.2980 support area and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It opened the doors for more losses and the price traded below $0.2800.</p>
      <p>A low was formed near $0.2746 and the price later recovered above $0.2800. Besides, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.3149 high to $0.2746 low.</p>
      <p>At the outset, the price is consolidating losses above the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/07/ripple-xrp-price-rips-and-dips-bulls-protecting-support/">$0.2850 support area</a>. Additionally, there is a short term breakout pattern forming with resistance near $0.2910 on the same chart.</p>
      <p>If there is a downside break below the $0.2880 support, there is a risk of more losses below the $0.2850 support area. The next key support is near the $0.2800 level, below which ripple could revisit the $0.2750 area.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the price could correct further above $0.2900. The next key resistance is near $0.2950. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.3149 high to $0.2746 low. The main resistance area is near $0.2980 and the 100 hourly SMA.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/">chart</a>, ripple price is clearly consolidating losses above the $0.2850 area. To start a fresh increase, it must break the $0.2950 and $0.2980 resistance levels. If not, it could resume its decline below $0.2850 and $0.2800.</p>
