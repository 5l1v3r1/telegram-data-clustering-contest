      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 4 — Matthias Gelber is serious about his commitment to living a green lifestyle.</p>
      <p>The entrepreneur hasn’t owned a car for almost 20 years and more than 10 of them were spent living in the busy metropolitan city of Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>During that time, he relied solely on alternative modes of transport such as trains, buses and bicycles.</p>
      <p>Not only did Gelber reduce his carbon footprint by choosing to forego owning a car, but it’s also netted him major savings.</p>
      <p>He holds strongly to the 5Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle, rot or compost and refuse) and emphasised how the “refuse” element is the easiest and most pocket-friendly practice to adhere to.</p>
      <p>“People think that a green lifestyle is expensive but the opposite is true,” he told <i>Malay Mail.</i></p>
      <p>“A holistic green lifestyle includes asking yourself the question, ‘Do I really need this?’ The things that you don’t buy end up saving you money. Holistic green living has a net effect of saving you more than it’s costing you.”</p>
      <p>Gelber also has a monthly electricity bill of just US$10 (RM41) as a result of his eco-friendly lifestyle.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old’s dedication to zero waste practices and sustainability in everyday life resulted in him being voted the “Greenest Person on the Planet” during a 2008 competition conducted by 3rdWhale Canada.</p>
      <p>He will be sharing his views during WOWComm 2019 in a talk titled, “Let’s Make a Living from Healing the Planet, Rather than from Destroying It”.</p>
      <p>WOWComm 2019 will bring business icons, industry legends, key government officials, high net worth investors, and industry influencers together to discuss the importance of sustainable business practices. </p>
      <p>Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail and PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim are slated to be the guests of honour at the one-day conference.</p>
      <p>It will take place at Putrajaya Marriott on December 5.</p>

      <p>Gelber’s green values are rooted in a childhood spent playing in the forests of Burbach-Lippe, Germany, where he treated the serene woodlands as his own little “playground”.</p>
      <p>When acid rain began pouring down on the trees in his village, Gelber knew something had to be done to protect the forest that he knew and loved.</p>
      <p>“We had a problem with acid rain and the pine trees in Germany were dying.</p>
      <p>“I started reading Rachel Carson’s <i>Silent Spring </i>and I understood the link between industrial chemical pollution and its impact on human health and the planet.”</p>
      <p>The ascension of a German political party known as the Greens in the 1990s inspired Gelber to embark on his career as a green entrepreneur and environmental activist.</p>
      <p>“I realised as a teenager what my mission was and that it was to save the planet. </p>
      <p>“My late father once told me that I couldn’t make money from hugging trees so I had to prove that perception wrong.”</p>
      <p>Gelber then moved to Malaysia to continue his green mission and has given several TEDx talks on sustainability to students at Universiti Malaya and Universiti Putra Malaysia, to name a few.</p>

      <p>Some tips Gelber had for Malaysians to embrace eco-friendly living in their everyday routine included taking public transport rather than driving, substituting red meat in their diets for plant-based foods and replacing single-use plastics with reusable bags or containers. </p>
      <p>One of his methods to spark a sense of urgency in people regarding climate change is to link it to something that they care about. </p>
      <p>He added that one of the best audiences that he has had was a group of cancer survivors in Malaysia as they wanted to know about sources of pollution and how to live more environmentally friendly.</p>
      <p>“They were the most attentive audience because they personally experienced the impact of the environment on their health. </p>
      <p>“Generally, we need to find a language that people understand and understand what drives or motivates them. It might be the health aspect or how a green business can make you good, clean money.”</p>
      <p>Gelber is currently serving as director of sustainability at eco-friendly business hub Global Sustainability Exchange and is a strong believer in the ability of organisations to make a profit from green practices.</p>
