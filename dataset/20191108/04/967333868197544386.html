      <p>Former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions officially announced a bid for his old Senate seat in Alabama Thursday, The Hill reported.</p>
      <blockquote>“Our freedoms have never been under attack like they are today," he wrote in the announcement on his campaign website. "We have major party candidates for president campaigning on socialism, confiscating firearms, and closing down churches they disagree with. I’ve battled these forces my entire life, and I’m not about to surrender now. Let’s go!”</blockquote>
      <p>Sessions, a hardline Republican, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910231077125919-us-senate-overwhelmingly-supports-north-macedonias-bid-to-join-nato/">represented Alabama for two decades</a> before being chosen by Trump to serve as attorney general. Now, the longtime lawmaker must battle a packed crowd of Alabama GOP candidates to challenge Democratic Senator Doug Jones, who replaced Sessions in 2017.</p>

      <p>In November 2018, Sessions <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201909091076761284-alabama-bound-ivanka-gets-brutally-grilled-over-donald-trumps-faulty-hurricane-dorian-forecast/">resigned at Trump’s request</a>, after the AG recused himself from an investigation into ‘Russian meddling’ of the US 2016 presidential election. Despite being a target for Trump’s criticisms, Sessions maintains he still supports the president and his policies and enjoys high favour with GOP voters, The Hill says.</p>
      <p>Although two decades of as a top-tier elected official and the name recognition that comes with it may play in Session’s favor, his troubled relationship with Trump may be a serious handicap, as the president <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201909101076764593-noaa-agrees-with-trump-alabama-dorian-forecast-after-threats-of-firings--report/">enjoys significant popularity in Alabama</a> and his endorsement may make a difference in the vote, The Hill says, adding that multiple unnamed sources have confirmed that the White House privately warned Sessions’ inner circle against launching his bid to retake his old seat.</p>
