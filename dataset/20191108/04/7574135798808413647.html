      <p>Savages singer <b>Jehnny Beth</b> has shared a new solo single, “I’m the Man,” which is from the soundtrack to Netflix series <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/peaky-blinders-soundtrack-announced-stream-pj-harveys-cover-of-nick-caves-red-right-hand/"><i>Peaky Blinders</i></a>. “‘I’m The Man’ is an attempted study on humankind, what we define as evil and the inner conflict of morality,” says Jehnny. “Because it is much easier to label the people who are clearly tormented by obsessions as monsters than to discern the universal human background which is visible behind them. However, this song has not even a remote connection with a sociological study, collective psychology, or present politics; It is a poetic work first and foremost. Its aim is to make you feel, not think.” Sonically, we’re in visceral, industrial punk territory, with a little piano interlude to let you catch your breath. Listen below.</p>
      <p>The <i>Peaky Blinders</i> soundtrack is <a href="https://umc.lnk.to/PeakyBlinders">out November 15</a> and also features featuring Nick Cave’s “Red Right Hand” (and <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/peaky-blinders-soundtrack-announced-stream-pj-harveys-cover-of-nick-caves-red-right-hand/">PJ Harvey’s version</a>), plus tracks by The White Stripes, Laura Marling, Arctic Monkeys, Royal Blood, Radiohead, The Last Shadow Puppets, Queens of the Stone Age, David Bowie, Foals, Black Sabbath, Idles, Joy Division, Richard Hawley and more.</p>
