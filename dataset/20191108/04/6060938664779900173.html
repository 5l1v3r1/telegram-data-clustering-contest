      <p>The 33-year-old had scored 41 runs in the first T20I in Delhi where India suffered a seven-wicket defeat.</p>
      <p>The win at Rajkot helped India level the three-match series at 1-1.</p>
      <p>Chasing 154, India got off to a steady start as openers Rohit and Dhawan did not allow Bangladesh to get early breakthroughs. The skipper maintained a brisk strike-rate from the very start; and after the conclusion of the first six overs, India managed to reach a score of 63/0.</p>
      <p>Dhawan then upped the ante; and he, along with Rohit, ensured that the scoreboard keeps ticking at a rapid pace for the hosts. The duo of Rohit and Dhawan brought up their 100-run partnership inside ten overs.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh finally got the breakthrough in the 11th over as Aminul Islam clean-bowled Dhawan. Immediately after that, Rohit was also sent back to the pavilion by Aminul, reducing India to 125/2.</p>
      <p>However, KL Rahul (8*) and Shreyas Iyer (24*) ensured India's victory by eight wickets, with 26 balls to spare.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mohammad Naim and Mahmudullah's knocks of 36 and 30 respectively enabled Bangladesh to post a score of 153/6 in the allotted twenty overs.</p>
      <p>The teams will next lock horns in the final T20I of the series in Nagpur on Sunday.</p>
