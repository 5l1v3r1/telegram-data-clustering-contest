      <p>There were cheers Thursday in the auditorium of North Cobb Christian School. They were not for a sports team, but instead, for a <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/cobb-county/school-surprises-mother-of-fallen-solider-with-much-needed-new-car/1006225214?muECYj">parade</a> of veterans, all associated members of the school community.</p>
      <p>Somewhere in the audience of hundreds was Renee Dennis, the mother of fallen soldier Jacob Dennis. He was a graduate of North Cobb Christian School who was killed in the Afghanistan War.</p>
      <p>Dennis is an administrative assistant for the athletic director and has needed a new car for a while.</p>
      <p>She got one Thursday.</p>
      <p>"We've watched Renee and some of the cars she's had, and we thought, ‘You know what? A family that's been through what she's been through and meant to us, what they've meant to us… there's no way we can let her go around here without dependable transportation," <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/cobb-county/school-surprises-mother-of-fallen-solider-with-much-needed-new-car/1006225214?muECYj">said</a> Todd Clingman, head of the school.</p>
      <p>As the reflection of a US flag waves in her new windshield, thoughts of appreciation and her son Jacob come in waves.</p>
      <p>"He was fun. He was funny. He was the first one to help and the last one to leave," Dennis <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/cobb-county/school-surprises-mother-of-fallen-solider-with-much-needed-new-car/1006225214?muECYj">said</a>.</p>
      <p>Clingman said he wanted to bless her, so that's what the school did. </p>
      <p>The car is courtesy of Ed Voyles dealerships and several donors who wanted to do something kind for Dennis and her family. </p>
      <p>North Cobb Christian School also named its athletic field after Jacob Dennis.</p>
