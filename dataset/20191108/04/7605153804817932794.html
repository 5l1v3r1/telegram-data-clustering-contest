        <b>MILAN, Italy, Nov 8<i> – </i>Inter Milan and Napoli return to the Serie A fray after a disappointing week of European football for the Italian giants as leaders Juventus look to pull clear after punching their ticket to the Champions League last 16.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Juventus have 29 points from 11 games, one point ahead of Inter Milan, with resurgent Roma a further six points adrift in third.</p>
      <p>Napoli are seventh after a run of three league games without a victory.</p>
      <p>A win over struggling AC Milan would allow Juventus to keep ahead of Inter, who host midtable Verona after their 3-2 Champions League defeat by Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>After the frustration of throwing away a two-goal lead against the Germans, Antonio Conte’s Inter need a boost against Verona, who were themselves under fire during the week after their fans aimed racist chants at Brescia’s Mario Balotelli last weekend.</p>
      <p>“This defeat has really got to me and I hope that’s the same for my players,” said Conte, who blamed a lack of resources despite remodelling the team after his arrival last summer.</p>
      <p>“We made some mistakes in planning because we cannot play in two competitions with such a small squad,” said former Italy boss Conte, who won three Serie A titles in a row with Juventus from 2012 to 2014, and the Premier League with Chelsea in 2017.</p>
      <p>“We cannot play in Serie A and the Champions League constantly pushed to the limits.”</p>
      <p>Carlo Ancelotti’s Napoli host Genoa after a series of poor results which has put the club management at loggerheads with the players who refused to be confined to a training camp this week.</p>
      <p>Napoli have slipped 11 points off the pace after collecting just two points from their last three matches.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti’s side also missed a chance to secure their Champions League last 16 berth with a 1-1 stalemate against Salzburg.</p>
      <p>“We are not in a good moment, but we must react and move forward,” said captain Lorenzo Insigne.</p>
      <p>In a clash between two of Italy’s most titled clubs, Sarri’s eight-time reigning league champions host AC Milan who are sitting 11th in the table.</p>
      <p>New Milan coach Stefano Pioli has not improved the club’s fortunes with just four points in as many games.</p>
      <p>Juventus, meanwhile, could be without Cristiano Ronaldo who was substituted by Sarri “as a precautionary” measure with knee and thigh problems late in the 2-1 Champions League win over Lokomotiv Moscow.</p>
      <p>Roma will looking to keep the momentum going at Parma, to follow their 2-1 success over Napoli last weekend which lifted them into the Champions League places.</p>
      <p>Atalanta turn their focus to Sampdoria after bagging their first ever Champions League point with a dramatic 1-1 draw against Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The Bergamo side are level on points with fourth-placed Lazio.</p>
      <p>Fabio Grosso’s first game in charge of lowly Brescia will be against Torino who are also desperate for a result after a run of six games without a win.</p>
