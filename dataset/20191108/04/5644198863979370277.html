      <p>NEW YORK: A New York state judge on Thursday (Nov 7) ordered US President Donald Trump to pay US$2 million for misusing his namesake charitable foundation, resulting in funds being distributed to his 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>Justice Saliann Scarpulla of the state Supreme Court in Manhattan said the payment should go to a group of non-profit organisations because the foundation, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, has been dissolved.</p>

      <p>The White House was not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>Trump's foundation had the subject of a June 2018 lawsuit by the New York attorney general at the time, Barbara Underwood, against Trump and his adult children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka.</p>
      <p>Underwood filed suit after a 21-month probe that she said had uncovered "extensive unlawful political coordination" between the foundation and the campaign. The foundation agreed last December to dissolve.</p>
      <p>Letitia James, the current New York attorney general, called the US$2 million award and earlier settlement "a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain."</p>
