      <h1>Real Madrid wonderkid Rodrygo rejected Liverpool transfer before Bernabeu move</h1>
      <h2>Rodrygo's former manager at Santos has claimed the teenager decided not to join Liverpool amid interest from the Premier League leaders</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:59:05+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:59</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Real Madrid teenager Rodrygo's former manager has claimed he rejected a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Rodrygo, 18, was in the headlines this week as he scored a hat-trick in the Champions League victory over Galatasaray this week.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian has managed five goals in just six matches since joining Real in a Â£40m deal.</p>
      <p>But former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star Elano, who managed Rodrygo at Santos, has claimed he turned down the chance to move to Anfield before heading for Madrid.</p>
      <p>"There was strong interest from Liverpool for the kid when he was in the youth teams and they wanted him, but the offer was low," he told ESPN.</p>
      <p>"Then the offer arrived from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> . I had a chat with the club and I told them the kid was worth gambling on and that I would like to work with him.</p>

      <p>"He already had this ability at a young age.</p>
      <p>"There are very few players that are like that when they're so young. He's already mature and has a personality to his game."</p>
      <p>Rodrygo will hope to retain his place when Real take on Eibar this weekend.</p>

      <p>On the young striker's midweek hat-trick, boss Zinedine Zidane said: "We are happy for him because in the end when he gets the chance to play he plays well, and he did so again tonight.</p>
      <p>"He plays well in every sense. We know his qualities in attack well, but he also works hard in defence and helps out with a lot.</p>
      <p>"But we need to keep calm and not put any pressure on him."</p>
