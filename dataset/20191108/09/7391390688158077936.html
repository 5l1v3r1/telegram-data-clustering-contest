      <p>On Aug. 20, The Walt Disney Company announced that its new on-demand streaming service Disney+ would launch on Nov. 12, 2019, in the U.S., Canada, and the Netherlands and on Nov. 19, 2019, in Australia and New Zealand. As exciting as the news was, it was pretty hard to miss that Blighty wasn't included in either launch date. So <a href="https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/new-global-launch-dates-confirmed-for-disney/">when will Disney+ come to the UK</a>? Lucky for us, we've finally been given a release date.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 7, 2019, <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1192557075651383296">Disney+ announced via Twitter that it would be launching in the UK</a>, Germany, France, Italy, Spain from March 31, 2020. Hallelujah.</p>
      <p>Although no official announcement has been made in terms of pricing, <i>NME</i> points out "<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/disney-announce-launch-date-uk-ireland-2565728">When it launches in the US</a>, it will cost $6.99 (£5.35) per month — keeping the promise made last year that Disney+ will cost less per month than Netflix, one of its main competitors."</p>
      <p>And in terms of where you'll be able to access Disney+, there are <i>plenty </i>of options. As a press statement for the service reads, it'll be available at launch ("dependent on country") on Apple, Google, Roku, and Sony products (which includes the PlayStation 4), as well as Microsoft's Xbox One.</p>
      <p><a href="https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/documents/disney_fact_sheet_7_ba6de4bc.pdf">The roster that the service currently has lined up</a> for its first year is extensive (although their tweet did state that "titles may vary by territory," so we can't be 100% sure what we'll get right now).</p>
      <p>Detailed in a fact sheet published by Disney's Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International Division, Disney+ will provide "a direct-to-consumer, ad-free experience with a variety of original feature films, documentaries, scripted and unscripted series, and short-form content, along with unprecedented access to Disney's incredible library of films and television series."</p>

      <p>These will include a <i>High School Musical </i>series, Tom Hiddleston reprising his role as Loki in a series based on the character, two <i>Star Wars </i>series, and numerous animated series and shorts.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will also include recent and future releases, as "[t]he service will also be the exclusive streaming home for films released by The Walt Disney Studios in 2019 and beyond, including <i>Captain Marvel</i>, <i>Dumbo</i>, <i>Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin</i>, <i>Toy Story 4</i>, <i>The Lion King</i>, <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</i>, <i>Frozen 2</i>, and <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>."</p>
