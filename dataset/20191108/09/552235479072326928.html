      <h1>Fraser Forster's stunning Celtic display lamented by Lazio star as he makes controversial claim</h1>
      <h2>Marco Parolo was left stunned as the Hoops keeper produced another inspired Europa League display.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:08:11+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:08</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Lazio star Marco Parolo admits his side just couldn't find a way past inspired <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fraser-forster">Fraser Forster</a>.</p>
      <p>The big keeper rose to the occasion with several vital saves before <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/olivier-ntcham">Olivier Ntcham</a>'s dramatic winner sent the Hoops into the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> last 32.</p>
      <p>It's the second time in a fortnight Forster has foiled the Serie A giants, with a stunning reaction stop denying Simone Inzaghi's side an equaliser at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>The Englishman was again on top form in the Stadio Olimpico, denying the likes of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic as Lazio pushed in the closing stages.</p>
      <p>Parolo, who claims Celtic's first-ever victory on Italian soil was undeserved, labelled Forster as the decisive influence.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.lalaziosiamonoi.it/in-evidenza/lazio-celtic-parolo-solo-colpa-nostra-grave-uscire-in-un-girone-cosi-vd-114091">Sky Italia</a>: "It was like the first game, we played well but then dropped off. We relaxed and then they started to press.</p>
      <p>"They did well to equalise with their first chance. We had more chances, we deserved to win, but sadly in Europe you need to be alert right to last minute, this result means we now have to hope for other results.</p>
      <p>"I don't think we're inferior to this team. Granting <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> some counter-attacks can happen as at the end we were all forward, we created a lot but we didn't do well in converting the chances we had.</p>
      <p>"In Europe if you give away one chance you'll be punished, that isn't always the case in Italy. Their goalkeeper was decisive again.</p>
      <p>"We lacked ruthlessness and the will to win."</p>
