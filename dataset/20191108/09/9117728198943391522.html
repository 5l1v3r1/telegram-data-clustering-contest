        <b>Ralf Schumacher believes his own brother's all-time Formula 1 record of seven Drivers' titles is under serious threat of being beaten, with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> clinching his sixth last weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton won his third successive Drivers' Championship last weekend, as he crossed the chequered flag in second-place at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a>, leaving him just one title behind the legendary German driver.</p>
      <p><i>"Both of them have achieved something incredible," </i>Ralf said to <i>Auto Bild. "I think Lewis can break Michael's records now."</i></p>
      <p>Many have said that Hamilton is only this successful because of the machinery <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> have supplied him with over recent seasons, and Schumacher acknowledges that, but has insisted there are more factors to being an F1 champion: <i>"He always gets the maximum from the opportunities. Everything fits together with him.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"He has the experience, he has a crazy natural talent, he knows when to attack and when to sit back, and he feels extremely comfortable in his team. He knows he is the absolute number one.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"That creates trust and is very good for a driver. He probably doesn't make many mistakes because of that."</i>
