      <h1>Photos of Activist Greta Thunberg Used to Shame Office Workers</h1>
      <h2>Office workers who use plastic utensils are being shamed by colleagues who use pictures of climate activist Greta Thunberg to push them into changing their “unapproved” behavior.</h2>

      <p>Pictures of the Swedish 16-year-old activist looking somewhat less than happy have been spotted in workplaces in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, catalogued by <i>Haaretz</i> journalist Allison Kaplan Sommer.</p>
      <p>In one case, a black-and-white photo of the Swedish teenager hangs above a supply of plastic spoons – hinting workers should use the metal ones instead.</p>
      <p>Another photo shows a much smaller Greta cut-out placed in a box of plastic spoons at the offices of Israeli newspaper <i>Haaretz</i>.</p>
      <p>Her face is also seen in front of a stack of plastic cups in another office, emblazoned with the words: ‘Are you sure?’.</p>

      <p>Sky News <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/greta-thunberg-photos-of-activist-used-to-shame-office-workers-to-shun-plastic-11856465">reports</a> Tel Aviv recently said it would phase out single-use plastics in some child daycare facilities.</p>
      <p>One of the images of the 16-year-old – placed on top of a mug filled with disposable cutlery – has the caption “How dare you” – a nod to the speech she gave at a U.N. summit in New York in September.</p>
      <p>The deification of Greta Thunberg is being manifested in other ways beside workplace shaming.</p>
      <p>As Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/07/margaret-atwood-greta-thunberg-is-environmentalisms-joan-of-arc/">reported</a>, Margaret Atwood has declared Thunberg to be the ‘Joan of Arc of the environment.’</p>
