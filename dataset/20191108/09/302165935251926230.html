      <p>NAIROBI (Kenya), Nov 8 — Tanzania’s opposition party says it will boycott local elections later this month, accusing the government of impeding its candidates from running and making a mockery of democratic processes.</p>
      <p>Chadema, the main opposition outfit that has faced increasing hostility under President John Magufuli, made the announcement late yesterday following an extraordinary meeting of its leadership.</p>
      <p>“Our party believes it is wiser not to support such electoral cheating. To continue to participate in elections of this kind is to legitimise illegality,” said Chadema president Freeman Mbowe.</p>
      <p>Selemani Jafo, the minister for local government, expressed surprise at the decision, adding there would be remedies for candidates who felt they had been wronged.</p>
      <p>But Chadema accused electoral authorities of being complicit in scuttling their campaign efforts.</p>
      <p>Mbowe said several Chadema candidates had been outright disqualified by electoral officials from running in the nationwide November 24 polls to choose local government leaders.</p>
      <p>Others had found registration offices closed when they tried to apply or discovered their applications had been tampered with, he added.</p>
      <p>Rights groups say the intimidation of political opponents has escalated sharply under Magufuli, a strongman elected in 2015 whose administration has wielded wide-ranging laws to silence government critics.</p>
      <p>Police have broken up opposition gatherings and shut down Chadema meetings, the party says.</p>
      <p>Their activists have been kidnapped and beaten, and at least one has blamed authorities for an attack in 2017 which saw him shot multiple times.</p>
      <p>Several have disappeared and turned up murdered.</p>
      <p>“Magufuli and his party are afraid. We are not going to participate in this charade,” Mbowe said of the upcoming elections.</p>
      <p>The victors in the local polls form the political backbone for campaigning ahead of general elections slated for 2020.</p>
      <p>Magufuli, whose nickname “tingatinga” means “bulldozer” in Swahili, is expected to run for another five-year term.</p>
      <p>His rule has been marked by a democratic backslide in Tanzania, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said in a report last month.</p>
      <p>Free media has been cowed by draconian cybercrime laws, critical newspapers and bloggers have been silenced, and opposition activists harassed unlawfully, the report stated. — AFP</p>
