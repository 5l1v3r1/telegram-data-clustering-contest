      <p>Kelsey Grammer has given a positive update on the Frasier reboot, admitting that it’s “ready to go” and he’s preparing for a mid-2020 launch.</p>
      <p>The actor, who has been developing the iconic sitcom’s reboot since 2018, says he is now waiting for a network to pick up the show.</p>
      <p>Speaking on In Depth with Graham Bensinger, Grammer said the project is on “standby” as they secure a deal for the show’s airing rights.</p>
      <p>“We’ve hatched the plan, what we think is the right way to go,” Grammer said.</p>
      <p>“[We’re] working on a couple of possible network deals that we’re sorting.</p>

      <p>“We just have to staff it and find somebody who wants to give us money for it. You never know.”</p>
      <p>This comes after Grammer tried to get the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/are-the-full-frasier-cast-up-for-a-reunion-series-2460808">show’s full cast to return for its reboot</a>, revealing that “they seem to” be on board.</p>
      <p>Discussing <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/tributes-paid-frasier-legend-john-mahoney-dies-2237225">the death of John Mahoney</a>, who portrayed Frasier Crane’s father Martin, Grammer said: “We would need to deal with that within the storytelling, but I’d want everybody back, if they want to come back.”</p>
      <p>The  US sitcom – a spin-off to <i>Cheers</i> – ran for 11 seasons from 1993 to 2004. The series’ final episode saw the titular character, played by Grammer, announcing his move to San Francisco but ending up in Chicago.</p>
