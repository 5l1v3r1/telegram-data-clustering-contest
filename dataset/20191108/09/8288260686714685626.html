      <p>Moseley skipper Jonny Arr says his side are ‘confident’ heading into their fixture away against Plymouth Albion tomorrow afternoon. “We’ve been training really well. We targeted last week’s game and our next two games to really try and get three wins.</p>
      <p>“Our away form hasn’t quite matched our home form so we need to address that. “We know that Plymouth are a good side, especially at home, so it’s going to be a difficult challenge.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The former Worcester Warriors scrum-half was only the fourth player to rack up more than 200 appearances for his previous side. Arr and his wealth of experience was brought in to captain the Birmingham side earlier in the year he and admits moving away was a challenge.</p>
      <p>“Obviously it was quite a big change, going from Worcester where I’ve been for 12 years professionally and for all my life really,” said the former Royal Grammar School of Worcester pupil.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“To leave that behind was quite big but Birmingham has been brilliant and very welcoming. I think I have adapted quite well. “But being asked to captain this side was special and a big moment for me.”</p>
      <p>Arr joined the ‘new-look’ Moseley side under director of rugby Adam Balding and was very complimentary of his former Warriors team-mate. “Adam has created a really good environment – he had his work cut out when he came in.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“He’s pretty much put together an entire new coaching staff and playing squad but he’s done a really good job. “He’s created an environment that’s good to be around, the boys look forward to coming to training and look forward to playing under him as well.”</p>
      <h3>Red and Blacks continued unbeaten run at home</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/moseley-rfc">Red and Blacks continued</a> their unbeaten run at home last weekend with victory over Sale. Arr puts their impressive record of five consecutive wins at Billesley Common down to their ‘really good support base.’</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The club’s got a lot of history, while a lot of that might have been at the old Reddings ground, there’s definitely that feel at Billesley Common,” he said. “It certainly helps having a good crowd there every week to spur the boys on and I think that’s been a huge part about why we’ve managed to stay unbeaten.</p>
      <p>“I think a good objective this season would be to finish as high up as we can in the table. “Whether we can get promoted this year with such a new side, it’s going to be a tough ask but we’ll give it all we all we can to try and achieve that.”</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has recently qualified as a mortgage advisor and is optimistic about his future outside of a rugby career. “I think I probably do not have too long left playing rugby to be honest so I am certainly taking each season as it comes.</p>
      <p>“When I’m done playing, I don’t see myself going into coaching or anything like that “I have made the decision to make a start in a career in financial services. “It’s been different, but I’ve enjoyed the challenge of diving into something new and hopefully creating a successful career away from the field,” Arr added.</p>
