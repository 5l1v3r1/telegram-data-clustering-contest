      <h1>Creepy Chinese facial recognition system puts your name and photo on a billboard if you jaywalk</h1>
      <h2>Writer Matthew Brennan tweeted a shocking video of the strange system, although it remains unclear where it was filmed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:41:22+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:41</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>It’s something that many people do without giving it a second thought, but if you jaywalk in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/china">China</a> , you could be publicly shamed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facial-recognition">Facial recognition</a> technology is being used in several Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen, which can spot people jaywalking, and post their photo and ID to a huge billboard.</p>
      <p>Writer Matthew Brennan tweeted a shocking video of the strange system, although it remains unclear where it was filmed.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “Chinese facial recognition system to discourage minor traffic violations. Cross the road when you shouldn't and a picture of you with your name, ID card number pop up on the big screen for everyone to see.”</p>
      <p>His tweeted has garnered over 3,000 retweets and almost 5,000 likes (at time of writing), with many people replying to express their shock at the system.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, while it may be shocking to us, it’s pretty common place for locals, who have had to endure the system since 2018.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/shaming-jaywalkers-china-facial-recognition-technology-privacy-11196684">Channel News Asia</a> , Janine Wong, a news researcher in Shanghai explained: “It doesn’t matter if you’re walking or riding a bicycle.</p>
      <p>“(Your picture) will be captured, and your face will show up on a screen nearby so everyone can see your face.</p>
      <p>“Once they identify your face, all your information (like mobile phone number) is linked.”</p>
      <p>Facial recognition is widely used across China, including in several airports.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Mr Brennan discovered a kiosk at the Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, which scanned his face to display his flight detials.</p>
      <p>He tweeted a video of the kiosk in action, and explained how it worked.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “Wow! China Airport face recognition systems to help you check your flight status and find the way to your gate.</p>
      <p>“Note I did not input anything, it accurately identified my full flight information from my face!”</p>
