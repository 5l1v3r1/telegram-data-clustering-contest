      <p>Black Friday is nearly upon us, with retailers around the globe preparing for this mammoth sales event that officially takes place on 29 November. Actually it starts much earlier than that, and from here on in before you buy anything you should check whether it's at the best price. Whether you're Christmas shopping for others, looking to treat yourself or just need some new tech, during the Black Friday sale is the time to buy it.</p>
      <p>Once a US event, and in the UK first celebrated only at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Friday-Deals/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;node=161428031&amp;ref=nav_cs_gb&amp;nocache=1542015659667&amp;ascsubtag=06-3661756-11-0000000">Amazon</a>, now Black Friday is literally everywhere. <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3661756-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsearch-keywords%2Fxx_xx_xx_xx_xx%2F-why_wait-%2Fxx-criteria.html">Currys PC World</a>, <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3661756-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fblack-friday%2Fc6000670128">John Lewis</a> and all the other tech- and retail giants will be doling out bargains and discounts and there will be so much to see you won't know where to start.

      <h3>When is Black Friday 2019?</h3>
      <p>Every year Black Friday falls the day after Thanksgiving, which we appreciate means little here in the UK. The date you need for your calendar is <b>29 November 2019</b>, which thankfully will for most people fall just after pay day. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/gadget/best-cyber-monday-deals-3667890/">Cyber Monday</a> is also a thing, and that happens the very next Monday, so in 2019 it's on <b>2 December</b>. Expect huge discounts all weekend in between, and most likely in the weeks either side.</p>
      <p>Recently, retailers have been kicking off their sales early, so what was once a single day has become almost a whole month of bargains. Some retailers will actually keep their discounts going right through until Christmas, so it's not strictly limited to November, either.</p>
      <p>Don't worry though, we're on hand to let you know when retailers will launch their deals events so you won't miss a thing.</p>
      <p>Until the sales start you'll find our top tech deals below, followed by everything you need to know about Black Friday this year. <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/#tips">Click here to skip ahead to our deals tips and tricks</a>.</p>

      <h3><anchor name="tips"/>What is Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>After a holiday of giving thanks for family, friends and settled life, American retailers opted to juxtapose Thanksgiving with a huge day of commercial spending. Who were we Brits to resist the allure of heavily discounted items, too?</p>
      <p>It is debated whether or not Black Friday refers to a day retailers finally went ‘into the black’, meaning they finally made profit for the year thanks to heightened sales, or whether it actually has morphed from a description of horrible traffic in Philadelphia on the Friday after Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>When Black Friday first gained huge popularity about 10 years ago, it was usual to see newsreel of people physically fighting over big TVs in the middle of Walmart (or Asda in the UK, who has now <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3661756-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Finternet%2Fblack-friday-2019-3661756%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Farticle-3969540%2FAsda-PULLS-Black-Friday-second-year-row-claiming-concentrate-low-prices-festive-season-instead.html">opted to not take part</a> because of the mayhem).</p>
      <p>You can’t blame them really, as scenes often got out of hand at shops. But Black Friday has passed beyond trivial now as it has moved online, and it is serious business for retailers.</p>
      <h3>How to get the best Black Friday 2019 deals</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3661756/black-friday-2017.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The most important thing to do when considering whether something is a good deal is to ask yourself: “Would I still want and buy this if it was full price?” Often the answer may be no, which means you need to think whether you’re saving money with a discount, or wasting it caught up in the excitement of a sale.</p>
      <p>A deal for one person won’t be a deal for someone else, no matter how many times <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/?ascsubtag=06-3661756-11-0000000">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/06-3661756-11-0000000/http://www.argos.co.uk/">Argos</a> or <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3661756-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2F">John Lewis</a> might tell you otherwise.</p>
      <p>It’s important to track the prices of the gadgets and tech you want well before Black Friday too - you don't be fooled into a deal that's not such a great deal after all.</p>
      <p>It isn’t unusual (or difficult, or illegal) for some retailers to put prices up on Black Friday. Yes, that’s right - sometimes discount prices are higher on Black Friday compared to the rest of the year because dishonest retailers know they will get more page views from people ready to click buy.</p>
      <h4>Black Friday 2019 Amazon deals</h4>
      <p>Amazon is one of the best places to go for Black Friday deals, and it has just announced that its <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/internet/amazon-black-friday-sale-dates-3777214/">Black Friday sale</a> will begin on Friday 22 November through to Friday 29 November, with a series of Countdown sales between 18 and 21 November. Even before then there are deals, with its <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/browse.html?node=18978259031&amp;ascsubtag=06-3661756-11-0000000">Hidden Gems sale</a> kicking off on 8 November.</p>
      <p>There's <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/51981edd,8929215,008a4b45,bd2c5dcc,a8e7e340,823f6843/?ascsubtag=06-3661756-11-0000000">up to 25% off robot vacuum cleaners</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/1c17185b,dc5f1e01,c4cf3263,f5eeb947/?ascsubtag=06-3661756-11-0000000">up to 25% off Anker power banks and charging accessories</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/109411d9,a03125d0,3276043c,d3bb2b3f,62daa415,d9dc33d6,14c2a84b,0de5b325,a9f77490,58b1efa7,a651c46e,666cd122,069426e7&amp;showVariations=false/?ascsubtag=06-3661756-11-0000000">up to 25% off graphics tablets and accessories</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/56dea76b,9308a4de,afaca13b,56dea76b,a3c83bd3,9f32532b,ca2c9891,632fd823,71d87c08,bb3f9355,1746b9a6,71f30aad,994bac97,9548cbeb,dff85a20,4387fa8f,ef6b1c84,3e7cf34b/?ascsubtag=06-3661756-11-0000000">up to 25% off dashcams</a>, among many other great deals.</p>
      <p>It'll likely have huge discounts on its own products, but also across the site - especially through its <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/blackfriday?ascsubtag=06-3661756-11-0000000">short-lived Lightning Deals</a>.</p>
      <p>We'd recommend signing up to Amazon's <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/prime/pipeline/landing?ascsubtag=06-3661756-11-0000000">30-day Amazon Prime free trial</a>. It will get you free next day delivery (although it sometimes takes a little longer during the Black Friday rush) but will also get you access to Lightning Deals 30 minutes before those who aren't Prime members.</p>
      <p>Some Lightning Deals are so great that they sell out before that 30 minutes are up so without the Prime membership or free trial you may find you miss out completely.</p>
      <p>We'll be tracking and posting the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/internet/best-amazon-deals-3666855/">best Amazon deals here</a>. We will also highlight the best Amazon deals in this article to make sure you spotting them right away (there are so many deals on Amazon that it can be hard to find what you're looking for). Our list will also help ensure you couldn't get a better deal elsewhere.</p>
