      <h1>‘An incredible feeling,’ Actor Willem Dafoe says of experiencing EDSA revolution while filming ‘Platoon’</h1>

      <p>Every Filipino has an older family member who participated in the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution, that dramatic moment in Philippine history where a dictator was toppled by sheer force of numbers without resorting to bloodshed.</p>
      <p>Now in a weird turn of events, actor Willem Dafoe divulged that he was in the EDSA revolution, too. Dafoe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fNif_WGdc">said as much</a> to Vanity Fair earlier this week in a video break-down of his career’s most-memorable moments.</p>
      <p>The opportunity to join the bloodless revolution came up when Willem, now 64, was shooting the Oliver Stone movie <i>Platoon</i> 33 years ago.</p>

          <b>More than half of Filipinos weren’t even born during Edsa Revolution</b>

      <p>“I arrived in the Philippines and my plane was the last plane in because there was a revolution,” he said. He remembers being told by someone from the movie’s production to “sit tight, the movie’s canceled. There’s a revolution, we’ll get you out when we can.”</p>
      <p>The movie eventually got back on track, but the <i>Platoon </i>actor (or <i>Spider-Man </i>actor for the younger set) said that for “about three or four days, me and a couple of other people that were there ahead of time, were out on the streets with the people.”</p>
      <p><i>“</i>It was an incredible feeling because it was a revolution that happened for the most part without violence,” he said about the event that ended two decades of Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorial rule.</p>
      <p>More than half of the population now <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/more-half-filipinos-werent-even-born-during-edsa-revolution/">wasn’t alive yet when the revolution</a> happened, and many of us who weren’t, such as this reporter, wish we could have.</p>
