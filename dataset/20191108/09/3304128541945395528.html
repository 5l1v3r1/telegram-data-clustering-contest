      <p>The team’s camp was slightly delayed due to lack of finances, but the captain, Dorcas Shikobe, has said that despite the set back, they are focused on the job at hand.</p>
      <p>“Despite the minor setbacks faced by the team, our main focus is on the game tomorrow and I believe we shall perform well in the game,” said Shikobe.</p>
      <p>The aggregate winner will face either Cameroon or Ivory Coast for a direct ticket to the Japan Olympics.</p>
