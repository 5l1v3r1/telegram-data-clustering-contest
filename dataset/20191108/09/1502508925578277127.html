      <p>Swashbuckling Indian batsman <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rohit-sharma">Rohit Sharma </a>says good timing, and not big muscles, is what is essential to hitting the kind of massive sixes that he strikes.</p>
      <p>Hero of India's eight-wicket win over Bangladesh here on Thursday with a 43-ball 85, the stand-in skipper was on 'Chahal TV', an interview-based show conducted by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/yuzvendra-chahal">Yuzvendra Chahal </a>for the BCCI's official website.</p>
      <p>"You don't need muscles to hit sixes, even you (Chahal) can hit them," the stand-in skipper told Chahal, who broke into a chuckle at the suggestion.</p>
      <p>"In any case, sixes are not just about power but also timing, head should be still, position should be good. All this will ensure that you hit sixes," he explained.</p>
      <p>Sharma's knock on Thursday night was studded with half a dozen maximums, including three consecutive in the 10th over.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he was targetting six consecutive sixes, Sharma said, "I was keen but once I missed the fourth I thought I will take singles. I was trying to hit without moving."<br/><br/>Sharma also stressed on the need for one batsman to hold the innings like he did here.</p>
      <p>"It was important for someone to play long because when one batsman plays for long, then he can take the team home. I am happy with myself and more importantly with the team," he said.</p>
      <p>"We were under a bit of pressure because we had lost the first match but we did everything that was required. Obviously we can always do better," he added.</p>
      <p>The series-deciding third and final match will be played on Sunday in Nagpur, followed by a two-Test assignment, the last of which will be the two teams' first ever Day/Night clash.</p>
