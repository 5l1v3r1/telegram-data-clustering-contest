      <h1>Dawid Malan ton powers England to their highest-ever T20I total in win over New Zealand</h1>
      <h2>England squared the series at two-games apiece as Malan became just their second T20I centurion</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/dawid-malan">Dawid Malan</a> became only the second <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-cricket-team">England</a> batsman to record a Twenty20 international hundred as his destructive display of power hitting led to a comprehensive 76-run victory over a chastened <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/new-zealand-cricket-team">New Zealand</a> in Napier.</p>
      <p>In bludgeoning 103 not out from 51 balls, Malan joined <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alex-hales">Alex Hales</a> in an exclusive club, minutes after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Eoin_Morgan">Eoin Morgan</a> had broken the England record for the fastest T20 half-century.</p>
      <p>The pair’s England best 182-run partnership formed the bedrock of their highest-ever total of 241 for three, with New Zealand getting nowhere close, all out for 165 after 16.5 overs, as the series was squared at 2-2 ahead of a decider in Auckland on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Morgan was unable to follow his former Middlesex team-mate to three figures, falling for 91 from 41 deliveries in the final over, but it was the England captain’s arrival at the crease that saw a dramatic surge in tempo.</p>
      <p>Malan had started slowly as he took 19 from his first 18 balls but he needed only a further 31 to reach three figures – beating Hales’ effort against Sri Lanka in Chittagong in 2014 by 12 deliveries.</p>
      <p>After helping England overhaul their previous T20 best of 230 for eight against South Africa at the 2016 World Twenty20, Malan has immeasurably boosted his hopes of a squad berth in next year’s T20 World Cup in Australia.</p>
