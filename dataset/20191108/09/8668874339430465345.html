      <h1>England set for Japanese return eight months after World Cup final loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:25:07+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:25</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Beaten World Cup finalists <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> are <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/what-happens-now-for-england-rugby/">set to return to </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> eight months after their loss to South Africa.</p>
      <p>Japan have confirmed they will host Eddie Jones’ side on a two-Test tour next July, starting in Oita, where England beat <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> in a quarter-final last month, and finishing in Kobe, the city where they defeated <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/usa">USA</a> in September.</p>
      <p>Jones said: “Japan were fantastic <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> hosts and we feel humbled to have been a part of it. The England squad had a fantastic experience of the country and we are excited to return in July next year.</p>
      <p>“The Japan national team have shown again how good a side they are with their performances during the World Cup and I know they will provide a great test for us in July.”</p>
      <p>England last played Japan in November 2018 at Twickenham, winning 35-15 after a tight first half. This was only the second time in history the two sides had played each other.</p>
      <p>The only previous meeting between the two nations was at the inaugural World Cup in 1987 when England secured a comfortable 60-7 victory in Sydney. England have never played a Test against Japan in Japan.</p>
