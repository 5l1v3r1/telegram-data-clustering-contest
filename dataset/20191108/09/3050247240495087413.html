      <h1>Bitcoin Falls Below $9,000 as Price Teases Trading Corridor Breakdown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:13:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:13</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) price lost support at $9,000 on Nov. 8 after several days of downward action finally saw markets make a decisive move.</p>
      <p>Data from Coin360 showed BTC/USD breaking out of its narrow trading corridor between $9,000 and $9,500 on early Friday. </p>
      <h3>Bitcoin flickers bearish</h3>
      <p>That corridor had broadly characterized the largest <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency</a> since the end of October. A brief spurt beyond to $9,520 was soon met with resistance, while a dip into the $8,000 range was also short lived.</p>
      <p>In daily trading, Bitcoin hit local lows of $8,980 before likewise bouncing higher, with markets currently trading at around $9,000.</p>

      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/manipulation-cme-bitcoin-futures-flash-crash-to-fill-85k-gap">reported</a>, suspicions have mounted among analysts over price behavior in recent weeks and months. Earlier, erratic moves CME Group’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-futures">Bitcoin futures</a> market gained particular attention. </p>
      <p>There, the Bitcoin price moved to fill a “gap” in trading — observed when one session ends higher or lower than where the next begins — by suddenly crashing by hundreds of dollars before recovering minutes later.</p>
      <p>Filling in futures gaps has become standard behavior for Bitcoin, with analysts using them to forecast potential market drops.</p>
      <p>But some still remain bullish on the long-term outlook, with regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a> this week predicting BTC/USD rising to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-steady-above-92k-as-volatility-collapse-predicts-big-move">new all-time highs</a> of $22,000 next year.</p>
      <h3>XRP continues pre-conference fall</h3>
      <p>Beyond Bitcoin, Friday saw further poor performance for two major <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">altcoins</a>: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a> and Bitcoin SV (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-sv">BSV</a>). </p>
      <p>As previously <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/swell-the-news-xrp-drops-5-as-ripples-flagship-event-kicks-off">noted</a>, XRP, the token notionally associated with payment network <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple">Ripple</a>, failed to impress as the latter’s annual Swell conference got underway this week. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Since the event began, XRP/USD has fallen by more than 10%, at press time trading at just above $0.28 — its lowest since Oct. 25.</p>
      <p>BSV, meanwhile, fell 6.2% on Friday to $128.</p>
