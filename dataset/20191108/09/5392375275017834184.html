      <p>Xiaomi foldable phone with pop-up Penta camera appears in new patent<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Chinese manufacturing giant, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a>, is bringing some innovative features to the smartphone market. Recently, the company released the Xiaomi CC9 Pro/Xiaomi Mi Note 10. While this device is not exactly the first smartphone to use a Penta-camera setup, it is the first to have a 108MP main sensor in a Penta-camera setup. In fact, it is the first 108MP phone to go into mass production. According to a new patent document from CNIPA, the company is working on a new Xiaomi foldable phone. The patent sketches show that the Xiaomi foldable phone not only uses a pop-up camera setup, but it also has a Penta-rear camera system.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the five-rear cameras are on the op-up module. Looking at the images, when this smartphone is straightened out, the left side is thicker than the right. This is because that is the side that hosts the pop-up camera and probably the battery. From all indications, the folding of this smartphone is along a single hinge. There is no indication that this device can fold to either side.</p>

      <p>In all, we have to keep in mind that this is only a patent and it may never see the light of day. However, it is good to know that major OEMs are doing all they can to improve what we currently have in the smartphone industry.</p>
