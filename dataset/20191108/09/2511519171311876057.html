      <p>Terrapins with swastikas painted on their shells have been found living in a lake in the US.</p>
      <p>At least two of the reptiles have been spotted with the symbols which local media said they had been carrying for more than a month.</p>
      <p>Whoever painted the swastikas applied them in an anticlockwise direction. The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/nazism">Nazis</a> employed the hooked cross – for thousands of years a religious and cultural symbol around the world – in a clockwise orientation.</p>
      <p>Officials discovered the defaced animals after residents in Renton, a suburb of Seattle, reported them to police and posted images on social media, according to <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/no-luck-in-catching-cleaning-gene-coulon-park-turtles-tagged-with-swastika-symbol/1006039959">KIRO7</a>.</p>
      <p>One resident called the graffiti “bizarre”.</p>
      <p>City officials have drafted in federal colleagues to help capture and scrub the terrapins, which will also be given health checks, KIRO7 reported.</p>
      <p>Anti-racism campaigners reportedly plan to hold a demonstration in the park where the animals were seen.</p>
