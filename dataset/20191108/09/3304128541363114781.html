      <p>Deputy President William Ruto has vowed to strike Kibra constituency again in the future after Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga lost to Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party’s Imran Okoth in the Thursday mini-poll.</p>
      <p>In a congratulatory message to Imran, the DP on Friday morning stated that despite the loss the Jubilee party did well when compared to the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>He noted that Jubilee doubled its support from 12 per cent to 26 per cent in the yesterday poll.</p>
      <p>Citing violence that was targeted at supporters allied to Mariga, the DP lauded them for daring what ODM believed was its “bedroom”.</p>
      <p>“Pongezi Benard Okoth for Kibra. Congrats Mariga, Team Jubilee &amp; supporters for daring the so-called ‘bedroom’, braving the chaos/violence, to double our vote from 12%(2017) to 26% now. Our competitors came down 78% (2017) to 52%, ” he wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“They retained the seat we have served notice.”</p>

      <p>Imran was declared the winner of the poll after garnering 24,636 votes with Mariga, his closest rival, coming in second with 11,230 votes.</p>
      <p>Eliud Owalo of Amani National Congress (ANC) came third with 5,275 votes followed by Khamisi Butichi of Ford Kenya with 260 votes. The race had attracted 24 candidates.</p>
      <p>Mariga has already conceded defeat.</p>
      <p>The race was touted as a supremacy battle between the DP and ODM leader Raila Odinga ahead of the 2022 succession politics.</p>
