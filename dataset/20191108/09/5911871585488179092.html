      <p>I am not a gamer, but I am well aware that <i>Death Stranding</i>, the new video game from Hideo Kojima, is out today. I know this partially because our website appears to be smothered in advertisements for said game and its soundtrack, and partially because my Twitter timeline when I woke up was full of enthusiastic praise, like music critic Craig Jenkins saying it has “<a href="https://twitter.com/CraigSJ/status/1192670101545328640">big mushroom trip energy</a>” and comparing it to “<a href="https://twitter.com/CraigSJ/status/1192677803092795392">a playable Björk video</a>.” I also know it because Chvrches performed their song from the soundtrack on <i>The Late Late Show With James Corden</i> last night.</p>
      <p>Chvrches contributed the <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2059868/chvrches-death-stranding/music/">title track</a> to <i>Death Stranding: Timefall</i>, a soundtrack that also features new music from Major Lazer &amp; Khalid, Bring Me The Horizon, the Neighbourhood, Au/Ra &amp; Alan Walker, and others. It’s the best Chvrches song I’ve heard in some time, a return to form after last year’s misstep <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1997162/chvrches-love-is-dead-album-review/franchises/premature-evaluation/"><i>Love Is Dead</i></a>. On <i>Corden</i>, they gave a performance that, between the light show and Lauren Mayberry’s futuristic styling, felt like a fitting complement for a boundary-pushing video game.</p>
