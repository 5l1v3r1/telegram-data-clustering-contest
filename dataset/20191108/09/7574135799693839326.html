      <p><b>The Shins</b> have released their first two songs in two years on a single for the <a href="https://fugyep.org/">Fug Yep Soundation</a> 7″ vinyl series, which was created in memory of the <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/richard-swift-rip/">late</a> Richard Swift (who was a member of The Shins for five years) and which will support the Swift family and MusiCares and Music Support UK.</p>
      <p>“Waimanalo” is a rollicking song that kind of sounds like the folk rock songs on The Beatles’ <i>Help!</i>, while “Trapped by the Sea” is bubbly, shimmering psych-pop that kinda sounds like Beach Boys via Panda Bear. They’re both very different and good in their own ways, and you can listen below. The artwork (above) was created by Richard Swift.</p>
      <p>Shins frontman James Mercer also recently released a <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/broken-bells-share-new-single-good-luck-stream/">new Broken Bells song</a>.</p>
