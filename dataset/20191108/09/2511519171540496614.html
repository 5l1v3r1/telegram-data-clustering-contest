      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ZlatanIbrahimovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> is soon to end his spell in Major League Soccer, with a return to Europe seemingly imminent – and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ACMilan">AC Milan</a> appears to be his destination.</p>
      <p>Having signed for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/la-galaxy">LA Galaxy</a> in 2018, he will bring his two-year stay Stateside to an end in December after scoring more than 50 goals.</p>
      <p>His side were knocked out of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mls">MLS</a> Cup play-offs in late October by rivals <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/los-angeles-fc">Los Angeles FC</a>, with Zlatan scoring in the 5-3 defeat.</p>
      <p>The veteran Swedish striker had not given any specific details of his impending move back to Europe, but any plans of a surprise announcement may have been spoiled by MLS commissioner Don Garber.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>ESPN</i>, Garber referenced the impact that Ibrahimovic has had on MLS as a whole – and seemed to reveal his next move.</p>
      <p>“Zlatan is an interesting character. He’s a thrill a minute. You need to have those guys that are breaking through like David Beckham did,” Garber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGEDZ35FqsE">said</a>.</p>
      <p>“A 38-year-old guy, who is now being recruited by AC Milan, one of the top clubs in the world.</p>
      <p>“He’s almost set records with how many goals he’s scored over the last two years. He’s exciting on and off the field, he certainly keeps our hands full!</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day I’d love to see him back but that’s going to be up to LA Galaxy.”</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic played for AC Milan between 2010 and 2012, between a short stint at Barcelona and a long, successful stay at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/paris-saint-germain">Paris Saint-Germain</a>.</p>

      <p>He then moved to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in 2016 and had been linked with a move back to Old Trafford, but it now appears a return to the San Siro will instead be his immediate future.</p>
      <p>Milan are struggling in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Serie_A">Serie A</a> this season, sitting in 12th place with games against Juventus and Napoli coming up next.</p>
      <p>They have already sacked manager Marco Giampaolo after just three months in charge, replacing him with Stefano Pioli at the start of October.</p>
