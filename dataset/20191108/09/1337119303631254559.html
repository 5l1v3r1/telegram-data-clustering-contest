      <h1>Disney+ is launching in the UK on March 31st 2020</h1>
      <h2>Over four months after its debut in the US</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:07:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jon-porter" target="_blank">Jon Porter</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ will be <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1192557075651383296">available in the UK on March 31st</a>, a little over four months after it launches in the US on November 12th, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced on an earnings call yesterday. Along with the UK, the service is also set to launch in other major European markets — including Germany, France, Italy, and Spain — on the same date.</p>
      <p>Disney+ is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862167/free-disney-plus-hands-on-pilot-marvel">already available in the Netherlands</a>, where it launched as a free pilot trial back in September. But its wider March 2020 launch will be the first time many viewers in Europe are able to legally watch Disney+ exclusives including <i>The Mandalorian</i> and <i>The Lady and the Tramp</i> live-action remake.</p>

      <p>The big question now is how much Disney+ will cost when it comes to the UK. The service is currently set to cost $6.99 a month in the US, and will cost <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862167/free-disney-plus-hands-on-pilot-marvel">€6.99 a month in the Netherlands</a> starting from November 12th.</p>
      <p>Yesterday’s UK release date announcement coincided with then news that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20954072/disney-plus-amazon-fire-tv-deal-agreement-launch">Disney+ app will be available on Amazon Fire TV streaming devices</a>, along with LG and Samsung smart TVs, Roku’s streaming devices, Apple TV, iOS, Android, Xbox One, and PS4.</p>
