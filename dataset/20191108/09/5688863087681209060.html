        <b>Assam batsman Riyan Parag wants Assam to cause more upsets in the ongoing season of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy just like they did in the last year's domestic season, beating big teams. The 17-year old believes that Assam can qualify to the playoffs of the ongoing domestic T20 tournament. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Parag impressed the world with his performance in the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/indian_premier_league">Indian Premier League</a> finishing with an all-round performance of 160 runs and two wickets in the marquee T20 league which took place earlier this year. Gearing up for the next challenge and taking inspiration from his <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/rajasthan_royals">Rajasthan Royals</a> stint the youngster wants to try and make every opportunity he gets count moving forward. </p>
      <p>“T20 is a different ball-game altogether. It’s about 120 balls, one has to be much calculative and there is a lot of risks involved. I want to bring whatever I experience I have and contribute to my team,” Riyan told Sportstar.</p>
      <p>The part-time legspinner had a forgettable run in the recently concluded <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/vijay_hazare_trophy">Vijay </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/hazare_trophy">Hazare Trophy</a>, managing only 128 runs in nine games. However, he bagged 13 wickets and is hopeful to carry that confidence ahead. </p>
      <p>“Vijay Hazare Trophy was a disappointing tournament. I don’t shy from saying that. I was bad with the bat, but I did contribute with the ball, which I am happy about. I will bring that confidence in the T20s as well. In this T20s now, and in IPL, I will be fruitful with the ball because I have worked hard on my variations,” he asserted.</p>
