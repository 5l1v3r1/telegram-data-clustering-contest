      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:58:22+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:58</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have confirmed that midfielder Dani Ceballos is out of Saturday's trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City.</p>
      <p>The Spanish midfielder has featured in every single Gunners game in all competitions since his arrival on loan from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , either starting the match or coming on from the bench.</p>
      <p>He scored his only Gunners goal to date in the 4-0 win over Standard Liege in the Europa League last month, but having been substituted in the 54th minute of the 1-1 draw at Vitoria in the same competition on Wednesday, he will now miss the trip to the King Power Stadium to face Brendan Rodgers' Foxes.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/team-news-latest-dani-ceballos">confirmed on their website</a> that Ceballos sustained an injury to his left hamstring in Portugal, and although the he is currently being assessed he will miss the Leicester clash.</p>
      <p>Gunners boss Unai Emery appeared to confirm that Ceballos would be out after the draw on Wednesday, telling BT Sport: "He has a small injury but I don't think he is [going to be available] for the next weeks."</p>

      <p>When pressed on whether Ceballos' absence could mean recalls for either Mesut Ozil or Granit Xhaka at Leicester, he added: "We are going to prepare for the match with the players, some players had a rest today and maybe someone who played this evening.</p>
      <p>"But I think every player can be another possibility to play for Saturday and to be ready."</p>

      <p>The injury is likely to keep Ceballos out of the forthcoming Spain squad for their Euro 2020 qualifiers against Malta and Romania next week.</p>
      <p>Arsenal go into the game at Leicester six points behind the Foxes in the table, knowing that a defeat would both damage their top four hopes and heap more pressure on beleaguered boss Emery.</p>
