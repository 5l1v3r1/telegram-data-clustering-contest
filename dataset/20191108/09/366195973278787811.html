      <p>Stunna 4 Vegas has been putting in work alongside fellow North Carolina spitter <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Da-Baby/profile/">DaBaby</a> for a minute now, and today he's come through with some brand new music for the masses. Teaming up with the reliable <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/offset/profile">Offset</a>, who has made a talent out of holding down guest appearances. Together they have created "Up The Smoke," a track that while lacking in any particular substance, comes heavy on the bounce. And for that reason, there's an appealing immediacy to the infectious single; mindless enjoyment courtesy of two talented rappers.</p>
      <p>Offset sets it off with a slick verse, ticking boxes with many of his favorite topics. Though some might have hoped for something a little more personal from the <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/migos/profile">Migos</a> rapper, remember that there's a time and a place. Here, it's all about the braggadocious energy, a memo that Stunna not only received - he wrote the damn thing. His closing verse features enough boundless energy to turn heads, riding the beat with a welcome blend of charisma and menace. Check this one out now, and sound off below.</p>

      <p>20 racks cash on a lawyer, the case closed<br/>Rap money turned me into an A-hole<br/>Don't tag me when it's gunsmoke<br/>I'm tryna knock off your block like legos</p>
