      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> has been on a roll in recent times; and if his Man-of-the-Match-winning effort against the visitors in the second T20I in Rajkot wasn't enough, former India opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virender-Sehwag">Virender Sehwag</a> has said that Rohit's scoring rate is unmatched and even regular skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> can't show such consistency when it comes to scoring at the pace at which Rohit scores.</p>
      <p>"Hitting 3-4 sixes in an over or scoring 80-90 runs off 45 balls is an art that I haven't even seen (Virat) Kohli pull off as regularly as Rohit (Sharma)," Sehwag told Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>"Sachin used to tell others if I can do something on the field, why can't you? But he never understood that there's only one God and the sort of things God can do, no one else can."</p>
      <p>Chasing 154, Rohit -- who was playing his 100th T20I -- smashed 85 runs and helped the team cross the line with more than four overs to spare at the Saurashtra <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">Cricket</a> Association Stadium.</p>
      <p>During his 43-ball knock, the 32-year-old Rohit hit six fours and six big sixes to bring the Rajkot crowd to its feet.</p>
      <p>Rohit then appeared on a BCCI video hosted by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal after the game and revealed the mantra for hitting sixes.</p>
      <p>"When I hit three consecutive sixes, I tried to go for six maximums. But when I missed the fourth one, I decided I will take singles," said Rohit while speaking about the three back-to-back sixes that he hit against off-spinner Mosaddek Hossain.</p>
      <p>"You don't need huge body and muscles to hit big sixes. Even you (Chahal) can hit sixes. Power is not the only thing you need to hit sixes, you need timing as well. The ball should hit the middle of the bat and your head should be still. So there are a number of things you need in order to hit a six," he added.</p>
