      <p>The selfie has garnered more than 2m likes and thousands of comments from fans of the show.</p>
      <p>The pair’s co-stars also couldn’t contain their excitement over the reunion with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lisa-kudrow">Lisa Kudrow</a>, who played Phoebe Buffay, writing: “Lucky lucky. #beautifulpeople.”</p>
