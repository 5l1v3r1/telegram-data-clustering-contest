      <p>Drake will own 60 percent of the company, while Canopy will retain a 40-percent stake and distribution rights, and run its day-to-day operations.</p>
      <p>"Drake's perspective as a culture leader and entrepreneur combined with Canopy Growth's breadth of cannabis knowledge will allow our new company to bring an unmatched cannabis experience to global markets," Canopy chief executive Mark Zekulin said in a statement.</p>
      <p>For his part, Drake called the business venture "really exciting".</p>
