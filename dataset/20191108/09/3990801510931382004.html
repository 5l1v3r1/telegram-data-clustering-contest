      <h1>CHEAP: Forget the Samsung T5, get this beefy 1TB Intel SSD for just $92</h1>
      <h2>Intel 660p NVMe SSD will put Samsung's T5 to shame</h2>

        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Games are starting to take up obscene amounts of space these days. Case in point, <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i> requires about 130GB of storage. How nuts is that? Even if your PC packs a beefy 1TB SSD drive, that’s still more than 10 percent of its capacity. The good thing is that SSD drives are also getting cheaper.</p>
      <p>In fact, you can now grab a 1TB Intel 660p NVMe SSD for <a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;toolid=11800&amp;pub=5575402880&amp;campid=5338330150&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FIntel-660p-Series-M-2-2280-1TB-PCI-Express-3-0-x4-3D-NAND-Solid-State-Drive-SSD%2F302910692273">just $92</a>, more than 25 percent cheaper than its list price of $125. That’s what I call a good deal.</p>
      <p>Now, there’s a catch: it’s an internal drive. “Sure, it sounds enticing, but I’m in the market for a portable drive,” you might say. No problem, you can easily convert the Intel 660p into a portable drive.</p>

      <p>True, an NVMe SSD might be an overkill for portable storage, considering USB enclosures come with some performance bottlenecks. But if you’re on the market for a portable SSD anyhow, you might actually end up saving some cash and taking advantage of the improved performance anyhow.</p>
      <p>Let’s do some math. A 1TB Samsung T5 portable SSD will set you back about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-T5-Portable-SSD-MU-PA1T0B/dp/B073H552FJ/?tag=tnw88-20">$190</a>. Instead, you can grab a discounted 1TB Intel 660p at $92 and purchase a high-quality enclosure from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Aluminum-Enclosure-Ultra-Slim-External/dp/B07R9R2W45/?tag=tnw88-20">Orico</a> ($35) or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MyDigitalSSD-Portable-Express-External-Enclosure/dp/B07HCPCMKN/?tag=tnw88-20">MyDigitalSSD</a> ($25). Not only will you save between 70 or 80 bucks, but you’ll also <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13510/mydigitalssd-m2x-usb-to-nvme-storage-bridge-review">likely achieve</a> higher read and write speeds.</p>
      <p>It’s also pretty satisfying to make your own DIY portable drive, trust me. I recently picked up a 1TB Kingston A2000 NVMe along with an Orico enclosure myself, and couldn’t be happier with my choice. It’s small, fast, and significantly cheaper than any ready-made external SSDs.</p>
      <p>Had I spotted this discounted Intel 660p, though, I would’ve certainly went for it instead. Grab a 1TB Intel 660p NVMe SSD for $92 by <a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;toolid=11800&amp;pub=5575402880&amp;campid=5338330150&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FIntel-660p-Series-M-2-2280-1TB-PCI-Express-3-0-x4-3D-NAND-Solid-State-Drive-SSD%2F302910692273">clicking here</a>.</p>
