      <h1>Angelo Alessio reveals the Kilmarnock study sessions that have turned his fortunes around</h1>
      <h2>The Italian was named Manager of the Month for October after a difficult start to his time in Scotland.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T06:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Parks, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-parks/</a></address>
      <p>Angelo Alessio admits hiring an English tutor and engaging a tactical rethink have transformed his fortunes at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a>.</p>
      <p>The Rugby Park boss landed the Ladbrokes manager of the month award for October after a haul of nine points from a possible twelve.</p>
      <p>It’s a far cry from a start to his reign which had some calling for the Italian to be sacked after Europa Cup elimination to Welsh minnows Connah’s Quay was followed by two <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> defeats on the bounce.</p>
      <p>But with the help of his teacher, the language barrier’s been lifted and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/angelo-alessio">Alessio</a> insists all the talk his now translating into future success.</p>
      <p>He said: "The beginning was difficult with my language but now it's much better. I still have to improve it, the Scottish accent is very difficult to understand.</p>

      <p>"I have a teacher and watch programmes here in English. I prefer of course sport, but also documentaries and movies but I don’t have a lot of time. I have to think about the next training, the next game.</p>
      <p>"Now It's much better because I have more confidence more fluency.</p>
      <p>"We changed the method of training and the bad results didn’t help me with this.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot of players from last season and I have to consider this. I wanted to change some things about the style, I believe in my methods, but I have to be flexible because I have these players.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to keep the same style as last season and I changed some situations on the pitch but now we have to continue, in the future I want to put other things in place that I believe in."</p>

      <p>It's been a dramatic improvement for Killie after the doom which surrounded the club in the summer and a manager of the month award is evidence of a man growing into the job and he insists there hasn't been a moment when he's had doubts over his decision to move to Scottish football.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm very proud of the award because it comes after a difficult start. So I consider it an award shared with my staff and my players and all colleagues at Kilmarnock.</p>
      <p>"I have never had a doubt or regret over coming to the club as I knew it’d be difficult as it was a great season last season at Kilmarnock. It was a big challenge of course but I prefer a big challenge than comfort.</p>
      <p>“It's important to work in the right way and believe in my methods.</p>

      <p>"Kilmarnock chose me for this job. It was a difficult start for many reasons after being eliminated from the Europa League and losing the first two matches.</p>
      <p>“But that's the past, we have to forget the bad start. Our focus is on the next game.</p>
      <p>“It's difficult because I have won it after two defeats but we were going very well until Motherwell and then had some problems in terms of injuries which complicated our progress.</p>
      <p>“But now we gave another important game on Saturday against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hamilton-academical-fc">Hamilton</a> and we can re-start our campaign."</p>
      <p>Despite the early trials and tribulations, Alessio believes everyone from the players, fans and board are now buying into his methods and style of play.</p>

      <p>He said: "Billy bowie and the board were always with me and he helped me a lot. They understand my job and of course and everything depends on the result.</p>
      <p>"I have my idea but the players have to think of my idea, they have to follow my instruction, follow me in everything.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to keep the same style as last season and I changed some situations on the pitch but now we have to continue, in the future I want to put other things I believe.</p>
      <p>"I think winning our first league game at St Johnstone was when I saw the team compact, they work hard in training sessions, they show the right attitude and concentration.</p>
      <p>Alessio confirmed Scotland defender Stuart Findlay faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines but 24-year-old won’t require surgery on a tendon problem and backed the player to come back better than ever.</p>
      <p>He said: “It's complicated but at the moment I can say minimum three months. I'm sorry for him because he was playing very well, more confident and in the national team too.</p>
      <p>“At the moment he is devastated but he will come back stronger and more hungry."</p>
