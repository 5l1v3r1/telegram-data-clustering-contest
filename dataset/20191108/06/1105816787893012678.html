      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>Bollywood actor Sunny Deol will arrive in Pakistan on Saturday to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Kartarpur Corridor.</p>
      <p>Confirmation of the actor’s arrival in Pakistan was also given by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh of India’s Punjab on Thursday, a source informed <i>The Express Tribune</i>.</p>
      <p>The actor turned politician is a BJP lawmaker from India’s Gurdaspur district.</p>
      <p>Several Indian media outlets also reported that the Indian Prime Minister’s Office has allowed Punjab Congress Leader, Navjot Singh Sidhu, to visit Pakistan and take part in the Kartarpur Corridor opening ceremony.</p>

      <p>The leader had sought permission from the external affairs ministry to attend the event, after receiving an invitation by Prime Minister Imran Khan.</p>
      <p>Two days ahead of the inauguration of the Kartarpur corridor, India claimed on Thursday that contradictory reports have been coming from Pakistan, with regards to whether Indians will require a passport to visit the Darbar Sahib shrine.</p>
      <p>However, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson, Raveesh Kumar, told <i>India Today</i> that an agreement had been signed between the two countries, finalising the modalities of the visits and added that India will follow suit.</p>
      <p>“Conflicting reports are coming from Pakistan. Sometimes they say passport is needed and sometimes they say it is not required. As of now, there is a bilateral agreement which specified required documents,” he said.</p>
