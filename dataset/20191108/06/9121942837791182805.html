      <p>BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia’s foreign minister has expressed hope that the U.S. won’t introduce sanctions against the Balkan country as he met a U.S. official in charge of embargos against states which purchase weapons from Russia.</p>
      <p>Thomas Zerzecki, an envoy for the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, held talks with Serbian officials on Friday, focusing on Russia’s recent rapid arming of Serbia.</p>
      <p>Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic said after the talks that Serbia “has nothing to hide” while pursuing its course of military neutrality between Russia and the West.</p>
      <p>Zerzecki did not speak, but the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade had previously urged against “transactions with Russia that risk triggering sanctions.”</p>
      <p>Serbia remains a key ally of Russia in the Balkans.</p>
