        <b>After India leveled the ongoing series with a win in Rajkot, Washington Sundar has revealed that India had to take pace off the ball after the Bangladesh openers got off to a good start. Apart from praising Rohit Sharma, Sundar reserved some special words for Yuzvendra Chahal for his performance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Post their first defeat to Bangladesh in the T20 format, India were under some pressure coming into the Rajkot T20I. Bangladesh piled on the pressure by getting off to a good start in the game by attacking <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/khaleel">Khaleel</a> Ahmed, whose first three balls of the match were dispatched for boundaries. With a par score of 180 expected on the wicket, the visitors looked well on course to achieve the same. However, Rohit decided to take the pace off the ball by bringing in his spinners - a decision Sundar felt was crucial. </p>
      <p>“They (Bangladesh openers) batted really well. We thought spinners will play a crucial role on this wicket. There was very good bounce and pace, and it was very important for us to take the pace off the ball,” Sundar explained in the post-match press conference, reported PTI.</p>
      <p>“Spinners definitely have a big role to play in the shortest format of cricket because they take the pace off the ball. Sometimes pitches can give little assistance to the spinners as well.”</p>
      <p>While Sundar restricted the run flow, it was <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/yuzvendra_chahal">Yuzvendra Chahal</a> who did a major part of the damage with chances and wickets at the other end. Considering the dew factor present in Rajkot, the Haryana bowler’s 2/28 was a great return and a turning point in the game.</p>
      <p>“It is very important to be honest, especially for someone (like Chahal) who can bowl in the middle overs and change the dimension of the game. We have seen him (Chahal) doing that in ODIs and T20 as well. He comes in the middle overs, takes 2-3 wickets and changes the game completely,” the offie added.</p>
      <p>“He (Chahal) is very experienced in this format and knows what to do to get wickets in the middle overs. We have seen him being very successful in the powerplays as well. He is definitely an asset for any team. The way he (Chahal) changes his pace and he knows what the batsman will try and do and which batsman is going to hit where. Different batsmen will have different plans but he is very clever. He is very calm and composed under pressure.”</p>
      <p>Once the bowlers had done their part and restricted the visitors to a score almost 30 runs short of the par, it was up to the Indian openers to deliver and they did with Rohit leading the line with an incredible 43-ball 85. Sundar had nothing but admiration for his skipper after the dominant performance. </p>
      <p>“I had the best seat in the house to watch him (Rohit) bat. If he plays like this then it is a treat for anyone in the stadium. Certain boundaries he hit were unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“I also think from a bowlers’ point of view. There were a few balls which Bangladesh had bowled and executed really well, but <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a>, as usual, was on-song,” Sundar concluded.</p>
