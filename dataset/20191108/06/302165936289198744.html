      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 8 — Malaysia’s net capital stocks (NKS) grew 4.2 per cent in 2018 with a value of RM3.1 trillion albeit a slight reduction from the year before, latest official statistics show.</p>
      <p>NKS are essentially the country’s wealth value in assets. </p>
      <p>However, last year’s NKS value grew at a marginally lower rate, according to data from the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM). The growth rate was 4.5 per cent in 2017.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile 2018’s Gross Capital Stock posted a value of RM4.8 trillion with a growth of 4.4 per cent. The rate was 4.7 per cent in 2017.</p>
      <p>“The growth was contributed by Services, Manufacturing and Mining &amp; quarrying sectors,” the DOSM said in a note alongside the 2018 capital stock statistics released today. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/index.php?r=column/cglossary2&amp;menu_id=eWd2VFdIZ2xpdzBmT2Y0a0pweDcwQT09&amp;keyword=SFlGdWc3UjdBOFUwaDVZQW9qcllEWUhSUW9pRmwxYTlISEJadnZlZ0p5OD0=&amp;release=1">value of fixed assets </a>in the services sector was the largest compared to other economic activities with a value of RM2.0 trillion and registered a share of 66.9 per cent, the report said.</p>
      <p>Stocks in mining and quarrying sector accounted for 18.0 per cent, while manufacturing sector was 12.0 per cent.</p>
      <p>In terms of asset types, structure (office lots, buildings, residentials, factories, etc.) remained the largest contributor to NKS with a share of 78.8 per cent, supported by expenditures on non-residential and other structures. </p>
      <p>Machinery and equipment was the second largest contributor at 12.6 per cent. </p>
      <p>But DOSM said in growth terms structure grew at a slower pace of 4.5 per cent while machinery and equipment and other <a href="https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/index.php?r=column/cglossary2&amp;menu_id=eWd2VFdIZ2xpdzBmT2Y0a0pweDcwQT09&amp;keyword=emdBbXdVWDE5ZTJGRE83VThiY1NlZz09&amp;release=1">assets</a> registered a 3.2 and 2.6 per cent growth respectively.</p>
