        <b>Kings XI Punjab owner Ness Wadia has requested BCCI in a letter to play the national anthem before the beginning of every game of the IPL. He also praised the BCCI for aborting expensive opening ceremonies and believes that the national anthem must be a norm in the world's number one T20 league.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kings XI Punjab owner Ness Wadia feels that <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a> should make playing the national anthem compulsory before every game of the IPL and also feels that the board did a great job by cutting off expensive opening ceremony that lead to large wastage of money. The <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/indian_premier_league">Indian Premier League</a> is arguably the best T20 league in the world and is one of the high points of Indian Cricket that the BCCI prides on and hence the national anthem should be the right way to start every game of this mega event.</p>
      <p>"It is an excellent move. It is high time that we don't have an opening ceremony. I have always wondered about the value and necessity of hosting an opening ceremony. One thing which they (BCCI) should do is to have the national anthem before each game given that it is the Indian Premier League," Wadia told PTI.</p>
      <p>"I had written to the BCCI earlier also and now I have written to Mr. Sourav Ganguly (BCCI president). And I think it is still played in movie theatres," he further added.</p>
      <p>Wadia also gave examples of other sports leagues in India playing the national anthem before every game like the Indian Super League and the Pro Kabaddi league. He feels that cricket being more than a sport in India, national anthem must surely be played before the games.</p>
      <p>"It is the Indian Premier League after all. We should be proud of what we have, which is a wonderful national anthem and a wonderful league. In NBA too, the national anthem is played before every game," he said.</p>
      <p>The IPL governing council had claimed that the prospect of IPL franchises playing friendlies abroad will be discussed only after viewing the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a>'s Future Tours Programme (FTP). Wadia commented on this matter by saying that like other football teams playing pre-season friendlies in foreign countries, the popularity of IPL shall increase if this move goes through and if franchisees are allowed to play abroad it will only help the IPL grow in popularity as a league.</p>
      <p>"The IPL is an Indian tournament. However, if one could look at expanding its reach, that will only be beneficial for all the stakeholders including the BCCI because it is also an international event," Wadia asserted.</p>
      <p>"If you look at the top football leagues all around the world, you do see them playing a lot of pre-season friendlies overseas. It only improves the visibility, reach and eventually the value of the IPL. BCCI must consider it," he concluded.</p>
