      <h1>Shah Rukh Khan mocks Arnab Goswami, Alia Bhatt and Karan Johar can’t control laughter</h1>

      <p>Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami is one of the most trolled TV anchors with his critics often poking fun at him through jokes and memes. His inimitable style has always given way to unending spoofs with comedians also using his character to regale their audiences up and down the country. Now an old video of Bollywood megastar Shah Rukh Khan mimicking Arnab Goswami on Karan Johar’s <i>Koffee With Karan </i>has gone viral. In the viral throwback video, the show’s host Karan Johar and Alia Bhatt are seen in splits on Shah Rukh’s amazing ability to mimic Goswami.</p>

      <p>Karan asked him to read a few lines from popular rhyme <i>Mary Had a Little Lamb </i>in Arnab Goswami’s style. Shah Rukh first hesitated saying that they mustn’t make the Republic TV founder famous. “Don’t make him famous,’ Shah Rukh said. King Khan, however, continued with his recitation of the rhyme while mimicking Goswami. Shah Rukh read, “Mary, Mary  had a little lamb, little, little lamb, little lamb.” His delivery while mocking Goswami left Alia Bhatt in splits as she struggled to control her laughter.</p>
      <p>Shah Rukh continued, “And nation wants to know whose fleece was white as snow, whose?” Everywhere that Mary went, The lamb was sure to go. Why, why, why?” By this time, Alia had begun thumping her chair in awe of Shah Rukh’s performance. Karan too began to laugh out loud as he too struggled to keep his composure.</p>
      <p>Alia announced, “Superb, that was superb.”</p>
      <p>Karan wanted to move on to his next question, but Shah Rukh interrupted, once again in Goswami’s style, “And I won’t let you speak.” Alia asked Shah Rukh to continue, “He followed her to school one day, That was against the rule.”</p>
      <p>Goswami who gained fame with Times Now TV channel launched Republic TV with the help of BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar in 2017. Later at an event in Mumbai, Goswami was <a href="https://youtu.be/3TxV2NSnLfE?t=650">seen annoying</a> Shah Rukh with his controversial observations. King Khan was seen seething but he had managed to keep his composure at the event.</p>
