      <h3>Talking points</h3>
      <p>Podcasts continue to provide a lifeline to a struggling online news industry, with Digiday reporting that US site Slate now <a href="https://digiday.com/media/slate-using-podcasts-drive-digital-growth/">makes half of its overall revenue</a> from the advertising on its audio shows. The company’s pod-focused strategy, including publishing excerpts from the shows online, saw the most recent run of its hit series <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ua/podcast/slow-burn/id1315040130">Slow Burn</a> attract 300,000 downloads in just 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Another huge pod success story this week is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84/episodes/downloads">The Missing Cryptoqueen</a>, the eight-part BBC Sounds tale of a multi-billion-dollar cryptocurrency scam which reached No 1 on the iTunes chart following its final episode. The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/04/the-missing-cryptoqueen-the-hunt-for-a-multi-billion-dollar-scam-artist">spoke with its creators</a> this week.</p>

      <p>Parker Posey is deputy marshal Emily Barnes, the woman investigating a breakout from a maximum-security prison, in this new scripted podcast masterminded by Law &amp; Order’s Dick Wolf. Four men have escaped, killing a guard in the process, and so begins a dangerous manhunt. One minute Barnes is briefing her team, the next she is juggling her childcare options. By the end of the first episode, the bodycount is already rising and the script is tight, allowing the fast-moving plot to grip listeners. <i>Hannah Verdier</i></p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07915kd/episodes/downloads">Have You Heard George’s Podcast? </a></b><br/>The winner of five British Podcast awards, spoken-word performer and writer George the Poet returns for a second series of experimental, stereotype-busting, immersive audio shows. In the first episode, he considers in verse how mainly white audiences are used to mining black artists’ trauma as if it were “a fossil fuel”, before taking a look at a test case via Reaganomics, rap and blaxploitation. Music from Grandmaster Flash, Bobby Womack and “Sabrina’s Boy” help to tie it all together. <i>Hannah J Davies</i></p>

      <p><i><b>Chosen by Katherine Godfrey, </b></i><i><b>head of </b></i><i><b>audio</b></i><b><br/></b>“Somehow word got out, there’s a weird ball in town.” Ancient aliens, Navy investigations and a Florida mansion all play a role in the story of a strange, vibrating ball that silenced a family. This is a quirky addition to the investigative genre, based on the mysterious arrival in 1974 of a metal sphere that, witnesses say, rolled around on its own. As host Lindsay Kilbride tells us in episode one, this is about much more than just a ‘weird ball’ – it seems to have captivated anyone that came into contact with it and, ultimately, taken over the lives of the Betz family.</p>
