      <h1>Episode 4 of The Morning Show, See, and For All Mankind now available on Apple TV+</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T06:59:50+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 06:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benjaminmayo/" target="_blank">Benjamin Mayo</a></address>
      <p>We now can work out what Apple’s exact schedule will be for Apple TV+. On a weekly basis, new episodes of its flagship shows are released at midnight Eastern Time.</p>
      <p>Today, new episodes of The Morning Show, See, and For All Mankind are now available to watch.</p>
      <p>The fourth episode of The Morning Show is called ‘That Woman’. The new See episode is called ‘The River’. For All Mankind rounds out the set with ‘Prime Crew’.</p>
      <p>Dickinson does not have a new episode as Apple released the entire season binge-style on November 1st. New episodes of the kids and family content have not been released; Apple is yet to confirm when it will make them available.</p>
      <p>One of the complaints in the aftermath of the Apple TV+ debut last week was the TV app included no visual affordance to let subscribers know when to expect the next episode.</p>

      <p>Apple has countered those complaints with somewhat of a quick-fix-it hack; the Season selector now also reads “New Episode on Friday”. Presumably, Apple is working on a more fully-fledged UI for the next episode schedule and this change is just the stop-gap solution … it does the job but it certainly isn’t the most elegant of designs.</p>
