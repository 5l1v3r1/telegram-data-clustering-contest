      <h1>Rugby: East Kilbride girls make Scotland Futures squad</h1>
      <h2>Torrance House duo Charlie Boan and Samantha Callaghan have an exciting year ahead of them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T06:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Two players from East Kilbride Rugby Club’s girls’ section have become the first-ever from Torrance House to be selected for their country.</p>
      <p>Charlie Boan and Samantha Callaghan have both been picked for the Scottish Futures squad programme and will mix it with the best up-and-coming talent over the next year.</p>
      <p>After a thorough selection process, 52 players were chosen across two age levels, with Charlie among 33 players invited to be part of the U18 programme and Samantha selected as part of the 19-strong group taking part in the U20 programme.  </p>
      <p>Calderglen High School pupil Charlie and Samantha, who attends Duncanrig Secondary School, will gain access to 13 fortnightly training sessions and monthly performance camps throughout the year, delivered in venues across the country.</p>
      <p>Regular fixtures will also be scheduled against other youth teams from the home nations.</p>
      <p>And EK Rugby Club’s girls coach, Elaine Martin is thrilled to see them receive call-ups.</p>
      <p>She said: “To have two girls from East Kilbride in the team is immense for a new development group.</p>

      <p>“Both girls are very deserving of their selection and I’m sure they will do East Kilbride Rugby Club and their parents proud.”</p>
      <p>Charlie has impressed for EK’s U18 side this season at festivals across the country, while Samantha has actually played a lot of her rugby at Cartha Queen’s Park in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Elaine explained: “Sam is an East Kilbride player, but she currently plays for Cartha as we don’t have a women’s team yet.</p>
      <p>“It’s better for her development to play games there, but she still trains with us.</p>
      <p>“This works well for us because she brings back knowledge and experience of playing for a senior team and passes that on to the rest of the group.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Scottish Rugby Union’s performance pathway manager for girls’ and women’s rugby, Robert Lavery, said: “Selection was really tough this year due to the large number of players who put themselves forward to be part of the programme.</p>
      <p>“We have already seen success in this pathway programme with a couple of our players from last year being selected to go on tour to South Africa with the senior team.</p>
      <p>“Sarah Denholm and Anne Young, who have both been included in the U20s programme this season, had a fantastic experience learning from Scotland Women Head Coach Philip Doyle and being part of the wider squad that beat South Africa twice earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt that this will spur on this year’s intake of players even more as it really demonstrates the opportunities that the Futures programme can provide and the success that can be achieved.”</p>
      <h3>Mixed results for junior boys</h3>

      <p>With East Kilbride Rugby Club’s senior section afforded the weekend off to watch the World Cup Final, it was left to the junior section to make the groundsman’s life difficult.</p>
      <p>The all-conquering under-15’s followed up last Sunday’s thumping of their closest rivals Greenock with an even more emphatic victory over a mis-matched, if game, Ardrossan.</p>
      <p>Tries were spread throughout the side and there were hat-tricks for McKinnon, Gardiner, Orenes and Ferrie, with Lewis and Murphy in fine form with the boot.</p>
      <p>With an unbeaten record now stretching to an impressive eight league games, the side look like they will be very difficult to dislodge from the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the under-13’s were unable to follow the success of their club mates, ending up on the receiving end of a defeat, and shipping a lot of points to a very powerful Birkmyre unit.</p>
      <p>There were consolation scores on the day from a great team try scored by Lewis Kerr and the enormous workrate of Keegan Lennox.</p>
