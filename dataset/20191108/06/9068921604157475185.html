      <p>Apple shipped an estimated 6.8 million smartwatches in the third quarter of 2019, according to research firm <a href="https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/blogs/wearables/2019/11/06/global-smartwatch-shipments-leap-to-14-million-units-in-q3-2019">Strategy Analytics</a>.</p>

      <p>Apple doesn't disclose <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch</a> sales in its earnings reports, grouping the wrist-worn device under its "Other Products" category, so we have do go from estimated figures, which can vary between research firms. <br/><br/>If Strategy Analytics' figures are accurate, ‌Apple Watch‌ shipments are up 51 percent compared to the third quarter of last year.</p>
      <blockquote>Apple shipped 6.8 million smartwatches worldwide in Q3 2019, rising an above-average 51 percent from 4.5 million in Q3 2018. ‌Apple Watch‌ remains a long way ahead of the chasing pack and its global smartwatch marketshare has grown from 45 percent to 48 percent in the past year. ‌Apple Watch‌ continues to fend off strong competition from hungry rivals like Fitbit and Samsung. ‌Apple Watch‌ owns half the worldwide smartwatch market and remains the clear industry leader.</blockquote>

      <p>The figures suggest Apple's closest wearables rival remains Samsung, which shipped 1.9 million smartwatches in Q3 and took 13.4 percent of the global market share. Fitbit, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/google-may-acquire-fitbit/">recently acquired by Google</a>, dropped to third place, losing just under 4 percent of its market share (11.3 percent). <br/><br/>According to the report, the global smartwatch market grew considerably, with shipments reaching 14 million units in total, up 42 percent year on year. Notably, ‌Apple Watch‌ growth outpaced overall market growth, indicating that Apple is eating an increasingly bigger slice of the burgeoning wearables sector.</p>
