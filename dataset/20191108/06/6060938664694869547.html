      <h1>Janhvi Kapoor and sister Shanaya Kapoor's social media PDA is all things love!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T06:26:24+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 06:26</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Janhvi-Kapoor">Janhvi Kapoor</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shanaya-Kapoor">Shanaya Kapoor</a> are often papped hanging out together at events and parties. While Janhvi marked her debut with 'Dhadak', Shanaya is yet to announce her big <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> debut. She was recently working with Sharan Sharma as an assistant director on the sets of Janhvi's 'Kargil Girl'. Janhvi had posted a photo of Shanaya Kapoor wherein she had donned the cap of an AD on the sets.</p>
      <p>Recently, Janhvi took to her <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Instagram">Instagram</a> and shared a pretty-looking picture of herself donning a purple thigh-high slit no shoulder dress. After the actress uploaded the picture, sister Shanaya was one of the first ones to comment on the post. She wrote, "My gorgeous sister"; to which Janvhi Kapoor replied as, "Love you".</p>
