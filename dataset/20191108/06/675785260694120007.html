      <p>Marcus Rashford has vowed that Manchester United will take the performance from their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-united-3-0-partizan-20836060">3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade</a> into the weekend's clash at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> .</p>
      <p>United qualified for the last-32 of the Europa League with a comfortable win over the Serbians at Old Trafford, where Rashford rounded off the scoring with the third goal.</p>
      <p>First half strikes from Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood - who was ted up by Rashford - gave United a 2-0 lead at half-time, before the England forward rounded things off with a third.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claimed that United need to used to display as a "template" for their season going into Sunday's Premier League match with Brighton, who currently sit above the Red Devils in the table.</p>

      <p>After the match, Rashford tweeted: "Efficient from us tonight and need to take that into the weekend. Great to score again and to set the kid Mason Greenwood up too."</p>
      <p>The forward also poked fun at his goal celebration in a follow-up tweet, writing in upside down text.</p>
      <p>When asked by reporters about Greenwood post-match, Rashford said: "He's done very well.</p>
      <p>"He just needs to keep knuckling down and working hard and the goals will come, because he has a lot of quality.</p>

      <p>"We're pleased to have qualified, but we really want to finish in top position and we have two more games to do it so we are in a good position."</p>
      <p>The forward was also critical of his own performance having missed a few chances in the first half.</p>
      <p>"There were a couple of times where I was half a yard too forward, so it was a game of fine margins, but we're happy with the three goals," he added.</p>
      <p>"For me, it's about recognising it and trying to correct it in the next game, but I won't let it stay on my mind for too long."</p>
