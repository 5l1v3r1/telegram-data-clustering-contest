      <p>Country's largest lender <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/state-bank-of-india">State Bank of India </a>on Friday reduced its marginal cost of fund based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points across all tenors, effective November 10, and sharply slashed the deposits pricing between 15 and 75 basis points.</p>
      <p>This is the seventh consecutive cut in lending rates by the bank this fiscal.</p>
      <p>With this reduction, the one year MCLR, to which most of its loan prices are linked, will come down to 8 per cent, the bank said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The bank also revised its interest rates on term deposits on account of adequate liquidity in the system. The new <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/deposit-rates">deposit rates </a>will also be effective from November 10.</p>
      <p>It has reduced interest rate on retail term deposit by 15 basis points for one year to less than two years' tenor.</p>
      <p>Bulk term deposit interest rates have been reduced by 30 to 75 bps across tenors, the bank said.</p>
