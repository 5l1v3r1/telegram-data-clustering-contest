      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jimmy-garoppolo">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> addressed his “babygate” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/scandal">scandal</a> Thursday, a week after his comment to Fox Sports sideline reporter Erin Andrews sparked a social media frenzy.</p>
      <p>On Halloween night, Andrews asked Garoppolo how it felt to be leading an undefeated team, after the 49ers beat the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a> on “Thursday Night Football” to improve their record to 8-0.</p>
      <p>“Feels great, baby!” Garoppolo responded.</p>

      <p>The remark sparked a furor online, as critics alleged that Garoppolo’s comment was disrespectful of Andrews’ professionalism as a journalist and the fact that she is a married woman.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t expect it to blow up like that,” Garoppolo told reporters Thursday, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/Jimmy-Garoppolo-Erin-Andrews-interview-baby-react-14818108.php">according to SFGate.com</a>. “It is what it is. I was excited. Eight-and-oh, baby!”</p>
      <p>He added: “I say ‘baby’ like 500 times a game to my teammates and stuff. It wasn’t like that,” <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/jimmy-garoppolo-addresses-erin-andrews-interview-i-say-baby-like-500-times-a-game-214106268.html">according to Yahoo Sports</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“I say ‘baby’ like 500 times a game to my teammates and stuff. It wasn’t like that.”<cite>— Jimmy Garoppolo, 49ers quarterback</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The day after the game, Garoppolo’s 49ers teammate, offensive tackle Joe Staley, posted on Twitter: “8-0!!! Feels great baby!!!” – appearing to good-naturedly mock Garoppolo’s comment to Andrews.</p>
      <p>Staley’s tweet drew a response from Andrews, who posted a series of “clapping hands” emojis.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, Andrews also responded to video of Garoppolo explaining that he meant no harm.</p>
