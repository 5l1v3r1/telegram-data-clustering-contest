      <p>Terming <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/demonetisation">demonetisation </a>as a "terror attack", Congress leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rahul-gandhi">Rahul Gandhi </a>on Friday said those behind the "vicious" assault have yet to be brought to justice.</p>
      <p>His attack on the government came on the third anniversary of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/demonetisation">demonetisation.</a></p>
      <p>On November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to the nation that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes would cease to be a legal tender.</p>
      <p>"It's 3 yrs since the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/demonetisation">Demonetisation </a>terror attack that devastated the Indian economy, taking many lives, wiping out lakhs of small businesses &amp; leaving millions of Indians unemployed," Gandhi said in a tweet.</p>

      <p>Those behind this "vicious attack" have yet to be brought to justice, the former Congress president said, using the hashtag 'DeMonetisation Disaster'.</p>
      <p>Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also hit out at Prime Minister Modi for the demonetisation move, describing him as "today's Tughlaq".</p>
      <p>"Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq rendered the country's currency useless in the year 1330. Today's Tughlaq did the same on November 8, 2016," he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>"3 years have passed and the country is suffering because- economy collapsed, employment lost. Neither terrorism stopped, nor the business of fake notes," he said, and asked who is responsible.</p>
      <p>Surjewala also cited global rating agency Moody's lowering the outlook on the government of India's ratings to negative, to claim that demonetization was a "man-made catastrophe".</p>
