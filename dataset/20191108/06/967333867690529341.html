        <b>A controversial tourism marketing campaign for the city of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, was launched in 2018 ahead of a visit by Pope Francis to the country. The polarising ad met various reactions and many complaints for its “exploitative or degrading” content.</b>

      <p>"The G-Spot of Europe" advertisement, created to attract tourists to visit Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, won an international tourism award in a World Travel Market event that took place in London this week, as the ad has increased tourism in the city up to 12 percent, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/european-citys-x-rated-tourism-travel-award">according to Fox News</a>.</p>

      <blockquote>“International tourism is a highly competitive field where only a few manage to stand out… even competing with the giants of tourism, such as Las Vegas, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201908241076627277-lithuania-stocks-up-on-millions-of-iodine-pills-fearing-radiation-leak-at-belarus-nuclear-plant/">was a great achievement",</a> said Inga Romanovskiene, head of the official development and business promotion agency Go Vilnius, according to Fox News, citing Travel Pulse.</blockquote>

      <p>The tourism marketing campaign, which <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201905291075437779-russia-envoy-arrest-sputnik/">described Vilnius as "The G-Spot of Europe"</a>, was first launched in 2018. The campaign’s main logo illustrates the head and shoulders of a young woman lying on a blanket displaying a regional map of the urban area. The woman's eyes are closed and she appears to be in ecstasy.</p>
      <blockquote>“Vilnius – the G-spot of Europe. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201905291075437779-russia-envoy-arrest-sputnik/">Nobody knows where it is</a>, but when you find it – it’s amazing", the campaign’s tagline reads.</blockquote>
