      <h1>Chiefs Medical Team’s Warning About Billiat &amp; Co.</h1>

      <p>Four key Kaizer Chiefs players were rested as precaution from the medical team, coach Ernst Middendorp has revealed.</p>
      <p>Khama Billiat, Lebogang Manyama, Eric Mathoho and Yagan Sasman were left out of the club’s 2-0 Absa Premiership victory over Chippa United on Wednesday night as Middendorp rang the changes with eight players making rare starts.</p>

      <p>It was the Glamour Boys second game in four days after their win, on penalties, against rivals Orlando Pirates in the quarter-finals of the Telkom Knockout.</p>
      <p>The two Soweto giants face off again on Saturday in a league derby at FNB Stadium.</p>
      <p>“I was in PE already on Sunday after taking an early flight from Durban (where the Soweto Derby was played) and the technical and medical team made the decision on Monday morning. We had to make sure which players would travel,” Middendorp told reporters.</p>
      <p>“The medical department had a clear say and said definitely not Khama, definitely not Lebogang and definitely not Eric and please be careful with Yagan Sasman. So these instructions came and we made a list on Monday morning and there was no ambition with Reeve Frosler and Kearyn Baccus either. It was very clear that I must listen to the medical department and the sports science on what we can do and which players should be used.”</p>
      <p>With those words, Middendorp explained the reasons behind not only making eight changes, but leaving out his key players for the trip to Port Elizabeth.</p>
