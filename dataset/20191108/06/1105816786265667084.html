      <h1>Blocking police at checkpoints, Iraqis revel in people power</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T06:50:05+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 06:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>BAGHDAD: </b>“I’m sorry, I can’t let you through without orders,” said the Iraqi civilian manning the makeshift checkpoint, smirking at the befuddled policeman he had waved down in the capital Baghdad.</p>
      <p>After a month of defying official curfews and road closures to protest, Iraqis have flipped the rule book.</p>
      <p>One recent evening, police officers erected a row of concrete t-walls on the same street, sealing off access to Tahrir Square, ground zero for protests in the capital.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators – one riding a motorised red rickshaw known as a tuk-tuk – sprung into action, chasing down the police.</p>
      <p>The tuk-tuk came to a screeching halt in front of the truck, blocking its exit as young Iraqi men pressured officers to reopen the road to Tahrir.</p>

      <p>Improbably, the officers relented, and the enormous truck reversed up the road to lift the barriers as the victorious tuk-tuk followed.</p>
      <p>Protesters swiftly hung a sign nearby: “Re-opened by order of the people!”</p>
      <p>Demonstrations broke out on October 1 in outrage over rampant corruption and unemployment. They were met with a violent crackdown that left dozens dead.</p>
      <p>Since resuming later last month, the protests have shifted to campaigns of non-violent resistance.</p>
      <p>Across the country’s south, Iraqis are carrying out sit-ins at schools, on highways and main bridges, and near government buildings.</p>
      <p>“No country? No class!” is the new slogan for thousands of Iraqi university students and school children refusing to go back to class until they see sweeping reforms.</p>
      <p>The teachers’ syndicate has extended its strike, despite threats from officials that protesting students or staff would face legal consequences.</p>
      <p>Most official administrations have been shut in large cities, with large banners also proclaiming the newfound authority: “Closed by order of the people!”</p>
      <p>In Diwaniyah, 200 kilometres (130 miles) south of Baghdad, the government’s provincial headquarters has literally become a dump.</p>
      <p>The building has been shuttered since protesters stormed it last month, and now rubbish trucks and residents add daily to the growing piles of trash there.</p>
      <p>And in Rumaitha, the southern town known for sparking Iraq’s 1920 revolution against the British mandate, residents are giving the government a taste of its own medicine.</p>
      <p>At the heart of a recent demonstration there, a protester grabbed a megaphone and cleared his throat.</p>
      <p>“We are declaring a curfew on all government employees and vehicles, and the closing of all party headquarters!” he declared, as people cheered all around him.</p>
      <p>Cities and towns across the south have imposed curfews in an attempt to clamp down on protests, but as the movement drags on, residents are increasingly ignoring the restrictions.</p>
      <p>In Baghdad, the military announced last week it would begin imposing a nightly curfew from midnight until 6:00 AM.</p>
      <p>That evening saw the largest protests yet in Tahrir, as streams of people defied the order and declared their opposition to the government.</p>
      <p>They have remained camped in the square, setting up tents and occupying an 18-storey building long known as “the Turkish restaurant”. Now it is called, among other names, “Revolution Mountain.”</p>
      <p>From there, young men watch the crowds gathering in Tahrir and along the key Al-Jumhuriyah bridge leading into the Green Zone.</p>
      <p>Riot police have set up barricades along the bridge to keep protesters from entering the enclave, where government offices and embassies are located.</p>
      <p>For those watching from above, their perch provided them a rare opportunity to monitor – and mock – security forces.</p>
      <p>“Welcome to the morning shift!” they call out over loudspeakers to the fully-equipped police units below, before blaring Arabic love ballads typically heard on morning radio in Iraq.</p>

      <p>Down below, protesters hand out fake Iraqi identity cards, where the nationality is listed as “Honorable Iraqi,” and profession as “peaceful protester”.</p>
      <p>Beyond the jokes, the demonstrations have taken on a more serious tone in recent days. Groups hold discussions on politics and economics, even debating the constitution, article by article.</p>
      <p>Some advocate for a return to a presidential system, others even say Iraq needs a dictator.</p>
      <p>But they are united in condemning the current system.</p>
      <p>“The competent people, they’re over here in Tahrir – not over there,” one protester said, gesturing towards the Green Zone.</p>
