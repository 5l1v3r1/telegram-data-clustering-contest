        <i>Jason Sudeikis and Lee Pace star in a flashy true-crime thriller about the an FBI informant and his car-making crony</i>
      </p>
      <p>Screenwriter and novelist Colin Bateman has here scripted a flashy but watchable true-crime thriller in the style of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/23/american-made-review-tom-cruise-doug-liman">American Made</a> (2017) or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/may/25/johnnydepp">Blow</a> (2001).</p>
      <p>It’s based on the stranger-than-fiction case of Jim Hoffman, a drug-runner and FBI informant who in the late 70s happened to be a California neighbour of automobile entrepreneur <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/21/guardianobituaries.usa">John DeLorean</a>, who at that time was having real trouble selling the sports car he had designed, with its falcon-wing doors and its unreliable engine, coming sluggishly off the production line in a Northern Ireland factory with financial help from the British government. (The car’s sole success was its iconic appearance in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/25/back-to-the-future-michael-j-fox-christopher-lloyd-how-we-made">Back to the Future</a>.) Desperate for cash, DeLorean accepted a dodgy deal from Hoffman, hoping to ease his cash-flow worries with cocaine profits from Hoffman’s sleazy drug-dealer contacts.</p>
      <p>Jason Sudeikis is amusingly cast as the grinningly insecure beta-male Hoffman, in awe of the cool, platinum-blond visionary DeLorean, played by Lee Pace. The movie persuasively suggests that Hoffman is a sociopath and a chancer who set up the deal as a way to be pals with a macho business hero, and persuading the FBI to keep him on their books and out of jail.</p>

      <p>For its part, the FBI was greedy for a sting that would not merely net a big cocaine importer but sensationally convict one of the most famous men in America. But it was a blatant entrapment: could it be that DeLorean’s prestige hypnotised everyone?</p>
      <p>There are a few cliches here: the sun, the pool parties, the Cessna airplanes bringing in the cocaine, the jukebox bursts on the soundtrack designed to induce a feelgood glow. What keeps the film going is simply the factual chaotic bizarreness of what is happening: an improvised deal on Iran-Contra levels of crookedness. Sudeikis is authentically bland and slippery.</p>
      <p>• Driven is released in the UK on 8 November.</p>
