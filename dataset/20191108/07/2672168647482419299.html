      <p>Chin Human Right Organisation (CHRO) made a further demand for an immediate release of Chin State Upper House lawmaker Whei Tin representing the National League for Democracy on November 7.</p>
      <p>With the passage to time, the Arakan Army (AA)’s political image will be decreasing although its aims are to meet freedom, human rights and democracy. For that reason, we would like the AA to pay special attention to this point, said the CHOR in the statement.</p>
      <p>The arrests of the AA are causing possibility of disbelief and misunderstanding between Chin and Rakhine to grow, the statement said.</p>
      <p>Chin State Upper House lawmaker Whei Tin representing No 11 Paletwa Constituency was abducted by Arakan Army (AA) on November 3.</p>
      <p>Five Indians, Chin State Upper House lawmaker Whei Tin, two boat drivers, one translator and one other were arrested by the AA in Kalardan River at 10 am on November 3.</p>
      <p>One of five Indians was dead because of trouble breathing during AA’s interrogations. He was looked after by the medic team, but in vain, according to the AA statement.</p>
      <p>At 4.45 am on November 4, information appeared that the abductees were released and they arrived back safely, but Chin State Upper House lawmaker Whei Tin is still detained. The AA said a special statement about why they have detained Whei Tin would be released.</p>
      <p>The AA’s arrest of Whei Tin has turned four days.<br/>The loss of the Upper House MP has an effect of State security. We will take measures as planned cooperating with the president and the speaker of the parliament, said Secretary Dr. Hla Moe of Hluttaw’s Right Committee.     </p>
