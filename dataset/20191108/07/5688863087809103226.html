        <b>Indian Women left-handed opener Smriti Mandhana has become the fastest Indian to score 2000 ODI runs, just behind male counterpart Shikhar Dhawan. She achieved this feat during the third ODI between India and West Indies and took 51 innings to reach the landmark as compared to Dhawan's 48 innings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Smriti Mandhana has tasted a bit of history as she becomes the second fastest Indian to reach 2000 ODI runs after <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shikhar_dhawan">Shikhar Dhawan</a> and also the third fastest woman cricketer to achieve this landmark after Belinda Clark and Meg Lanning. Her milestone came during a stylish 74-run knock against the West Indies in the series decider at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. She stitched a brilliant 141-run opening stand with fellow opener Jemimah Rodrigues as the Indian women comfortably chased the target of 195 to win the series 2-1.</p>
      <p>Mandhana has amassed 2,025 runs in 51 ODIs at an impressive average of 43.08 and the future looks bright for the stylish 23-year-old opener. The fastest woman to reach the 2000 ODI run mark was Belinda Clark who took 41 innings and second fastest is fellow Australian Meg Lanning who took 45 innings to reach the same landmark.</p>
      <p>In men's cricket, the record of fastest 2000 runs is held by retired Protea legend <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/hashim_amla">Hashim Amla</a> who took just 40 innings to achieve the feat and Shikhar Dhawan took 48 innings to score the same amount of runs.</p>
