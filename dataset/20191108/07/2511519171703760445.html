      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a> has claimed he is considering legally changing his name to “Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West” for a year. </p>
      <p>The controversial rapper made a surprise appearance at the fifth annual Fast Company Innovation festival in New York on 7 November, where he spoke with Yeezy footwear designer Steven Smith. </p>
      <p>On typical form, West spoke about economic empowerment as well as his intention to run for president in 2024.</p>
      <p>“Martin Luther King didn’t get killed because he had a dream; he had something else he was gong to talk about,” he said, according to <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christian-genius-billionaire-kanye-west-talks-2024-presidential-candidacy-moving-yeezy-stateside-1253358">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. </i></p>
      <p>“He talked about black empowerment, economic empowerment,” said West. “When I did <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/forbes">Forbes</a></i>, I showed them a $890 million (£768m) receipt and they still didn’t say ‘billionaire’. They don’t want us to know that we can buy land; they don’t want us to have the 100 percent ownership [that] I have at Yeezy...</p>
      <p>He continued: “When people say it’s crass to call yourself a billionaire, I say I might legally change my name to Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West for a year until y’all understand exactly what it is… It will be on the license plate.”</p>
      <p>West also reportedly sparked laughter upon mentioning his 2024 presidential run.</p>
      <p>“When I run for President in 2024,” he began, interrupted by laughter from the audience. “What y’all laughing at? We would create so many jobs! I’m not going to run, I’m going to walk. When you see headlines saying Kanye’s crazy — one in three African Americans are in jail and all the celebrities are in jail also because they can’t say nothing, they got no opinion, they’re so scared!”</p>
      <p>West recently released his much-delayed new album <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jesus-is-king">Jesus is King</a>, </i>which has received mixed reviews from critics.
