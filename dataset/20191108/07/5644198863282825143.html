      <p>REUTERS: England have called up batsman Jonny Bairstow for the test series against New Zealand as injury cover for Joe Denly, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Bairstow, who was due to fly home after the ongoing T20 series, was left out of the test squad following a disappointing Ashes series against Australia.</p>

      <p>Denly injured his ankle in training.Â </p>
      <p>"(Denly) is making progress on his rehabilitation and is hoping that he will be fit to play in the three-day warm-up match starting on Friday Nov. 15," the ECB said.</p>
      <p>England have another warm-up game before that in which Bairstow, who has scored more than 4,000 runs in 69 tests, can press his claims for a spot in the side ahead of the two-match series starting on Nov. 20.</p>
