        <b>Willian has admitted that Barcelona did try and make a move for him last summer but the offer that the La Liga giants submitted was rejected by Chelsea. The 31-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to the La Liga this season especially with his current deal expiring at the end of the season.</b>

      <p>With <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/eden_hazard">Eden Hazard</a> leaving the club for <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/real_madrid">Real Madrid</a> and the a transfer ban imposed on <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/chelsea">Chelsea</a>, manager <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/frank_lampard">Frank Lampard</a> has had a few problems to handle before his season even started. However, what compounded his issues was the fact that <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/willian">Willian</a> and a few other players were still looking to leave the club with a few sides more than keen on a move for the Brazilian.</p>
      <p>While no move eventually materialized for the 31-year-old the last eighteen months has seen the winger heavily linked with a move to Barcelona. However, now in an interview, Willian went on to reveal that Camp Nou giants only really made a move for him last summer after the 2018 World Cup.  The Brazilian also added that while he did seriously consider leaving Chelsea, both his family and him decided that staying in London was the better option.</p>
      <p>“The only real official offer I had came from Barcelona, last year, after the World Cup. Barcelona indeed presented an offer to Chelsea but it was rejected. That was the only actual time I had to discuss something like this with my family, although we really love it here [in London]. So there were several factors that helped us in staying,” Willian told DAZN series Saudade.</p>
      <p>Willian moved to Chelsea from Shakhtar Donetsk in the summer of 2013 and has since gone on to make an incredible impact for the Blues. He’s made well over 300 appearances for the Stamford Bridge side and won two Premier League titles under two different managers. But London is not where the 31-year-old plans to retire as the Brazilian went on to admit that he would like to return to his boyhood club Corinthians before he retires.</p>
      <p>“If I have to return to Brazil, I’d like to play at Corinthians again. It represents a lot, I was born and raised there, my footballing career began there when I was nine, I’ve spent my entire childhood there. I’ve been a Corinthians fan since I was little, even before I played there, my family also supports the club. ‘So when I got there all my relatives were very happy, and then, after I got to the first team, everyone was overjoyed,” concluded the 31-year-old.</p>
