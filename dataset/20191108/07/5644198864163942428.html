      <p>The 50-year-old O'Neill, who took charge of Northern Ireland in 2011, led them to a surprise last-16 berth at Euro 2016 and they reached the playoffs for last year's World Cup.</p>
      <p>They are third, behind Germany and the Netherlands, in their Euro 2020 qualifying group and face an uphill battle to qualify for next year’s tournament.</p>
