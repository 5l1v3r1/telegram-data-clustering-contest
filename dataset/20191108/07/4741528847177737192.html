      <h1>Greek firm gets FG backing to train youths on fishing </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:52:46+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/joseph-olaoluwa/" target="_blank">Joseph Olaoluwa</a></address>
      <p>In line with the Federal Government’s plan to lift several people out of poverty, a Greek firm, <b>Concept Amadeus</b>, has disclosed its intention to set up an industrial fishing project for the purpose of engaging youths in the Niger Delta region.</p>
      <p><b>The Details:</b> The firm would construct fishing vessels that would ensure fish is processed according to European Union Standards. At the end of the process, <a href="https://punchng.com/fg-backs-greek-investment-in-industrial-fishing/">3500 people are to be engaged and 110 fishermen catered for</a>.</p>
      <p><b>The plans were unveiled</b> when representatives of Concept Amadeus met with the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba in Abuja. The representatives were led by Alabo Wokoma.</p>

      <p><b>The Minister responded that</b> the Government was aware of the project and would give adequate support for the growth of the project. Agba noted that the projects would boost fish production for the region.</p>
      <p><b>Agba noted that the project</b> would keep youths engaged through job creation and enhancement of economic activities in the region.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I am particularly impressed by this initiative, which shows that a lot can happen when there is partnership between the government and the private sector.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The Concept Amadeus/Greek Partnership was one of the good things that came out of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan Focus Labs, which was organised by the Federal Government from January to May 2018</i>,” he said.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>On the other hand</b>, Wokoma told the minister that the training had been remodelled based on the recommendations from the contributions from the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP)’s team.</p>
      <p><b>He disclosed that the project</b> would not only build fishing vessels but also train young Nigerians in the art of fishing. The training is scheduled for Greece.</p>
      <p><b>What you should know: </b>Fish farming, if given utmost priority, can be valuable to the economy. Apart from producing enough fish to meet the nation’s demand, it can also be exported to other countries to be used as raw materials in manufacturing industries for productions of glues, paints, medications and so on.</p>
      <p><b>Fish farming can also be a viable sector</b> for foreign investments because when it <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/10/07/nigeria-losing-billions-to-underutilized-fish-farming-potential-nfan/">attracts the attention of foreign investors</a>, it will, in turn, be of advantage as it will boost the country’s economy.</p>
