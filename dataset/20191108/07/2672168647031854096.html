        <b>PHNOM PENH (The Phnom Penh Post/ANN) - Three suspects were sent to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court on Thursday accused of transnational human trafficking. They were arrested in the capital’s Daun Penh district on Tuesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Phnom Penh Municipal Anti-Human Trafficking and Juvenile Protection<br/>Office chief Keo Thea told The Post that the three – all Cambodians –<br/>were detained as a part of a joint operation with Daun Penh district<br/>authorities.</p>
      <p>They were allegedly planning to smuggle two victims, including<br/>a minor, to China via Vietnam. Authorities have returned the victims to<br/>their relatives’ care in their hometowns, according to Thea.</p>
      <p>Thea identified the suspects as Cambodian national, 21, male, private<br/>employee; Cambodian national, 21, male, security guard; and Cambodian<br/>national, 27, female, karaoke parlour employee.</p>
      <p>A Phnom Penh municipal police report said the victims agreed<br/>to travel to China after a female intermediary tempted them with the<br/>promise of $2,000 to $3,000.</p>
      <p>The victims, who did not hold valid passports, were promised by the<br/>intermediary that it would only take one day to have travel documents<br/>issued. After this, the report said, the victims were to travel to Ho<br/>Chi Minh City before another intermediary would receive them for the<br/>final leg of their journey to China.</p>
      <p>Thea said the arrests were made after an exhaustive search lasting<br/>several days, before joint forces finally tracked the group down to Van<br/>Rec bus station on the corner of Street 49 in Phsar Thmey III commune.</p>
      <p>A 2018 UN study titled Forced Marriages Between Cambodia and China<br/>revealed that Chinese clients pay brokers $10,000 to $20,000 to have<br/>women from Cambodia brought to the mainland.</p>
      <p>The victims unassumingly arrive in China with tourist visas that are<br/>often only valid for one month, which prompts brokers to demand the<br/>victims pay the cost of the trip, often pressuring them to enter the sex<br/>trade or marry local men, according to the UN study.</p>
      <p>A total of 986 Cambodian trafficking victims were repatriated from<br/>nine countries in 2017, said official figures from the Ministry of<br/>Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.</p>
      <p>This included 382 victims from Malaysia, Thailand (288), Vietnam<br/>(171), China (53), Laos (49), Indonesia (23), Japan (12), Singapore<br/>(five) and Myanmar (three).</p>
      <p>Yim Voreak, the deputy secretary-general for the Ministry of<br/>Interior’s National Committee for Combating Human Trafficking told The<br/>Post that the government had established a four-year National Plan of<br/>Action until 2023 to address the concern.</p>
