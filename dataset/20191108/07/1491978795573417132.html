      <p>Many of us should be flying less, that much is clear. I should definitely be flying less, if only to keep my stress levels down. This isn’t because I am frightened of flying; the prospect of falling out of the sky is less stressful to me than almost every other aspect of the whole palaver.</p>
      <p>I am delighted to read of new efforts to load punters on to planes more efficiently. As far as I am concerned – and assuming the plane is boarding only from the front – these should involve getting the passengers seated at the back to board first so that, during their overhead locker faff, they are not getting in the way of others. What has never made any sense to me is why business-class customers, always seated at the front, are invited to board first. Obviously they will then get in the way of everyone trying to get to their seats further down the plane. I am sure there are plenty of columnists who could work up a metaphor here about the rich getting in the way of the poor, but I’m not going there.</p>
      <p>I have sat on both sides of that curtain in my time and I have never understood why the fat cats get on first. Neither do I understand what that stupid curtain is all about anyway. Is it to keep from the envious cattle class the orgy of luxury unfolding at the front? Or is it all about sparing the delicate business classes the ghastly sight of the underclasses crammed in behind them?</p>
      <p>My suggestion is this: load economy first, from the back to the front, but keep business class at the gate until the very end. Then, by way of recompense, the most senior member of the cabin crew should whip out a heraldic bugle and, with great ceremony, sort of pipe them aboard. Just to make them feel special.</p>
