      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jharkhand">Jharkhand </a>Mukti Morcha (JMM) has sought Rs 51,000 from those seeking party tickets for the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jharkhand">Jharkhand </a>Assembly elections, a party leader said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The money would go towards the regional party's fund to help it fight the polls, he said.</p>
      <p>The JMM had taken similar decisions in previous elections with the amount ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 21,000, JMMs general secretary-cum-spokesman Vinod Kumar Pandey said.</p>
      <p>"Those party workers who submit avedan (application) to contest (the assembly elections) should deposit Rs 51,000 in the party fund to help the party contest the elections.</p>
      <p>"We are not a corporate party. Our party runs with the contribution of party workers," Pandey said.</p>
      <p>Asked when the first list of candidates would be announced by the JMM, Pandey said, the party would inform in due course.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jharkhand">Jharkhand </a>Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) deciding to contest the elections on its own, the JMM, Congress and the RJD are likely to announce their seat-sharing formula soon.</p>
      <p>Assembly polls for the 81-member House will be held in five phases from November 30.</p>
