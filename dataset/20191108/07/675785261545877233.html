      <p>A "drunken" tourist sparked panic after tearing opening the emergency exit door moments before a plane was due to take-off.</p>
      <p>The dramatic moment happened on an Airbus A320 as 86 passengers were ready to taxi across the tarmac in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>But the tourist - who was allegedly intoxicated - rushed to the wing door and ripped it from the hinges causing the inflatable slide to deploy.</p>
      <p>Shocked passengers screamed while airport security staff pinned the blonde-haired man to the ground.</p>
      <p>Local media dubbed him a "crazed foreigner".</p>

      <p>The want-away passenger was pictured wearing jeans, a blue shirt and white trainers after having his hands and feet cuffed inside the airport.</p>
      <p>Staff from the Thai Smile airline said that more than 600,000 baht in damage had been caused by the incident.</p>
      <p>The traveller, who has not been named, was detained in custody while airport officials investigated the incident.</p>
      <p>One passenger onboard the plane said the tourist was "drunk" and had "opened the emergency door causing a lot of drama and a delay".</p>

      <p>The flight, WE169, had been due to depart at 3.40pm but was delayed. It eventually took off at around 5pm for domestic destination Bangkok.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for flag carrier Thai Airway's low cost short haul subsidiary Thai Smile apologised for the incident.</p>
      <p>They said: "The incident occurred when the plane was about to depart from Chiang Mai International Airport for Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>"After the aircraft door had been successfully closed there was a wait for a taxi to take off.</p>

      <p>"A foreign male passenger ran to open the emergency exit door next to the left wing of the plane.</p>
      <p>"The incident caused the emergency door to be opened entirely and an emergency slide unfolded.</p>
      <p>"The captain immediately suspended the flight and notified ground officials and security personnel to control the incident.</p>
      <p>''The foreign man was detained but it it not yet clear what his motivation was to do this."</p>
