        <b>FC Goa head coach Sergio Lobera has acknowledged the fact his side has been erratic of late, thereby calling for consistency from his side after a thrilling match against Mumbai City FC. Lobera was all praise for assistant coach Jesus Tato, who was credited for the goals coming from set-pieces.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Coming into the tournament as one of the favourites after they finished runners-up last season, the Gaurs started their ISL 2019-20 campaign on a high with a 3-0 win against <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/chennaiyin_fc">Chennaiyin FC</a> at home. However, their prolific ability to outscore their opponents was thwarted by <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/bengaluru_fc">Bengaluru FC</a> first, and then <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/northeast_united_fc">NorthEast United FC</a>, who held Goa to consecutive draws.</p>
      <p>Thursday was seen setting up for a similar outcome when <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/mumbai_city_fc">Mumbai City FC</a> got two quick goals in the second half after trailing 0-2 in the first half. Goa finally got back to their easy scoring form as Hugo Boumous and Carlos Pena added two more goals to win the match 4-2. Lobera, however, wasn’t very happy with the way his side kept the ball and has asked for consistency.</p>
      <p>“I am not happy. The start of the second half was not good for us. We need to increase our consistency levels, as it is possible to lose the match in 15 minutes. We need to learn and improve from these situations. We won the match, but we should have played better in the first 15 minutes of the second half,” said Lobera at the post-match press conference, reported ISL.</p>
      <p>“I am not happy with the start of the second half, but very happy with the reaction of the team. Sometimes when you are 2-0 up and concede two goals in 15 minutes, sometimes the team goes crazy. I think my team, after conceding, continued working in the same way and that is very important for me,” he added.</p>
      <p>Three of Goa’s four goals on the night came from set-pieces. Attributing the feat to assistant Jesus Tato, Lobera remarked, “I spoke before the match about the importance of set pieces. Tato, our assistant coach, is very good with these situations and helps us during the match. I am very happy that we got the three points, which are very important for us.”</p>
      <p>While Ferran Corominas, Lenny Rodriguez, Boumous, and Pena were the scorers for the visitors, midfielder Ahmed Jahouh was once again a lynchpin at the middle of the park, who kept the shape during the tumultuous times of the second half. However, Lobera refused to cherrypick individual performances.</p>
      <p>“For me the most important thing is the team. I am lucky that I have really good individual players, but the most important thing is working well with the team. I think good individual talents shine better in a good team. If the likes of Jahouh and Ferran Corominas are doing well, it is because of the team,” said Lobera.</p>
