      <p>The ASUS Zenfone 6 has been <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/30/asus-zenfone-6-review/">the surprise midrange flagship of the year</a>, and with the company's switch to a lighter, significantly more Pixel-like UI, the device is a no-brainer for people looking for an affordable, all-round good phone. ASUS is even making good on its promise for timely Android updates and has just started rolling out Android 10 to the Zenfone 6.</p>
