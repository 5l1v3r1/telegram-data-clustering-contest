      <p>A man is due in court in Limerick this morning charged in connection with the murder of 11-year-old Brooklyn Colbert.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn was found dead at a house in the Ballynanty area of the city last Sunday.</p>
      <p>A man in his 20s was arrested on Sunday night in connection with the case.</p>
      <p>He is due to appear before Limerick District Court at 10am today, charged in connection with the death.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brooklyn's funeral Mass will take place at St Saviour's Church in the city at 11am today. A private wake took place at the boy’s family home last night.</p>
      <p>Fr Donal McNamara of St Munchin’s Parish, said the whole of Limerick was praying for the boy’s parents and extended family.</p>
      <p>“He was an only child and it must be shattering for his family. The sadness is palpable around the north side of Limerick city, and all over really,” Fr McNamara said.</p>
