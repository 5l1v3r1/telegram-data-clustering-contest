        <b>PHNOM PENH (The Phnom Penh Post/ANN) - Cambodia plans to produce 500 more skilled accountants to address the Kingdom’s shortage of bookkeepers by 2021, said UN Development Programme (UNDP) Cambodia deputy resident representative Sonali Dayaratne on Thursday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dayaratne said this at the launch of the <i>Introducing the Accounting Technician Qualification</i><br/>project which is a joint programme between UNDP Cambodia, the National<br/>Accounting Council (NAC), the Institute of Chartered Accountants of<br/>England and Wales (ICAEW) and the Kampuchea Institute of Certified<br/>Public Accountants and Auditors (KICPAA).</p>
      <p>Since Cambodia’s economy is becoming more integrated<br/>regionally and globally, there is increasing demand among local small-<br/>and medium-sized firms for accounting technicians.</p>
      <p>This, she said, demands that Cambodia urgently increases the number<br/>of skilled accountants and upgrades its accounting standards to<br/>international standards so it can compete with neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>“There is a serious shortage of skilled accountants for<br/>private sector firms, especially small and medium enterprises in<br/>Cambodia. This is a barrier for enterprises accessing finance,<br/>government assistance or new technology.</p>
      <p>“This is consistent with the findings of a quick survey by UNDP<br/>Cambodia among employers, which revealed that there is a difficulty for<br/>micro-enterprises and SMEs in hiring professional accountants given the<br/>limited number of skilled ones in the market,” Dayaratne said.</p>
      <p>Ministry of Economy and Finance secretary of state and Chairman of<br/>the National Accounting Council (NAC) Ngy Tayi said at the launch of the<br/>programme that the future is bright for prospective accountants since<br/>there is already strong demand among local SMEs.</p>
      <p>“Cambodia’s accounting sector will get stronger as we produce more<br/>skilled accountants – this will also build more trust among investors in<br/>our accounting and financial reporting systems.</p>
      <p>“That will help ensure businesses and industry have proper corporate<br/>governance for monitoring their performance and operations,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dayaratne said the lack of accounting professionals is a concern for<br/>sustaining economic growth. However, it also presents a palpable<br/>opportunity to foster and supply quality employment to young Cambodians.</p>
      <p>“Tapping into this opportunity, UNDP initiated a partnership with<br/>NAC, KICPAA and ICAEW to develop and introduce this internationally<br/>recognised accounting technician qualification training curriculum for<br/>young Cambodians, including high school graduates and employees looking<br/>for a chance to upgrade their skills and climb up the corporate ladder.</p>
      <p>“The scheme is expected to increase youth employability in Cambodia<br/>through opportunities for students to be trained as skilled accountants<br/>at a low cost and within a short period.</p>
      <p>“It will help produce at least 500 more trained accountants by 2021,<br/>address the urgent needs of SMEs, which are a cornerstone of economic<br/>development, and leverage the services of capacity development<br/>institutions serving the accounting industry,” she said.</p>
      <p>According to the Industrial Development Policy 2015-2025, only 0.02<br/>per cent of micro-enterprises, 3.89 per cent of small enterprises and<br/>24.11 per cent of medium enterprises in Cambodia had adequate<br/>bookkeeping.</p>
