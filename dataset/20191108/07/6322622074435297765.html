      <p>ANKARA (Nov 8) The wife and a DNA-confirmed child of the killed leader of Islamic State (IS) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have been held by Turkey, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan revealed on Thursday, <i>Xinhua</i> news agency reported.</p>
      <p>"His wife has been at our hands for the past one and a half years. It is a sensitive issue for us that his DNA-confirmed child is also with Baghdadi's wife," the Turkish president told reporters.</p>
      <p>The total number of Baghdadi's relatives that Turkey has captured is almost "in double-digit numbers," but Ankara does not want to announce them all at the moment, Erdogan said.</p>
      <p>"I do not find it right to declare these right now. We will make a statement after everything gets clear," he said, citing that the investigation is still ongoing.</p>
      <p>Turkey captured al-Baghdadi's sister and her husband in Syria on Monday, Turkish officials announced.</p>
      <p>Al-Baghdadi was killed in a late-night United States-led raid on a compound near the village of Barisha in northwestern Syria on Oct 26.</p>
      <p>Elaborating on Turkey's military operation into northern Syria, Erdogan said there were still members of Syrian Kurdish fighters in the safe zone and continued attacking Turkey-backed Syrian National Army in the region.</p>
      <p>Erdogan said he would meet US President Donald Trump on Nov 13 and discuss the violation of the Turkey-US deal that stipulates the withdrawal of the Kurdish fighters from the safe zone in Syria. <i>â€” Bernama</i></p>
