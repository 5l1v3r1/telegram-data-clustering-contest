      <h1>HPCSA to determine the 'magnitude' of claims against paediatric surgeon Dr Peter Beale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:13:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:13</time> by <a rel="author">Azarrah Karrim</a></address>
      <p>The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) has launched an investigation into paediatric surgeon, Dr Peter Beale, who has been accused of medical negligence by several families.</p>
      <p>The HPCSA's investigation concerns allegations made by these families to determine the magnitude of the case.</p>
      <p>It will also investigate those who assisted in operations with Beale.</p>
      <p>Many families have come forward to tell their story of how their children died or were left with impediments after undergoing surgery with Beale.</p>
      <p>Most recently, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/joburg-family-describes-last-moments-of-sons-life-blames-top-surgeon-for-death-report-20191020">10-year-old Zayyaan Sayed</a> passed away after a routine operation with Beale at Netcare Park Lane Clinic in Johannesburg last month.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Magnitude of the case'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zayyaan's lung collapsed post-operation and he died shortly afterward.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/families-reveal-alleged-difficulties-in-dealing-with-now-suspended-surgeon-20191025">More families have since approached News24</a> to give their accounts of what happened to their children.</p>
      <p>Speaking to News24, HPCSA spokesperson, Priscilla Sekhonyana, said: "The primary aim is not to suspend the practitioner but to ascertain the magnitude of the cases, this will then inform the direction to be considered."</p>
      <p>She added: "It is important to note that there are three main practitioners in the operation of the patient: the surgeon; the anaesthetist and the theatre nurse.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, if the information is available to the HPCSA and it directs toward precautionary suspension on the part of the surgeon or the anaesthetist, then suspension regulations will be invoked."</p>
      <p>Sekhonyana explained that the council had already approached some families who have accused Beale of wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Sekhonyana said the council had been in communication with the Sayed family and decided "to invoke Chapter 4 which allows for it to institute the investigation where it is of the view that an act of misconduct is suspected".</p>
      <p>She added: "On the part of other parties, the HPCSA has contacted some family members mentioned in the list and the hospitals where the practitioner was operating for information."</p>
      <p>The medical has since become political with the <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/eff-pressures-hpcsa-to-take-action-against-paediatric-surgeon-accused-of-negligence-20191031">Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)</a> weighing in on the matter, putting pressure on the HPCSA to suspend Beale.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stern warning</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a letter to the HPCSA written by EFF secretary general Godrich Gardee, which News24 has seen, the party sent a stern warning to the council, pressuring them to suspend Beale pending an investigation into his fitness to practice.</p>
      <p>Gardee listed the names of six children who allegedly died under Beale's knife, saying it was "disturbing" that the HPCSA had not yet suspended him.</p>
      <p>Sekhonyana said the EFF had supplied them with information regarding the case.</p>
      <p>"The HPCSA believes that the EFF as a public representative did their part in supplementing complaints already received. The EFF has provided the HPCSA with contacts, some of which the HPCSA already has," Sekhonyana said.</p>
      <p>The Sayed family have also <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/family-set-to-lay-criminal-charges-against-top-surgeon-peter-beale-more-families-tell-their-tales-20191024">started criminal proceedings</a> against Dr Beale as well as the anaesthetist involved in their son's surgery, Abdulhay Munshi.</p>
      <p>Both doctors have been suspended from Netcare facilities while the <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/life-healthcare-group-suspends-peter-beale-following-allegations-of-negligence-20191027">Life Healthcare group</a> decided to suspend Beale's administrative privileges.</p>
      <p>Beale's attorney, Jeanne Albertse, told News24 that neither she nor Beale had been notified about these proceedings.</p>
