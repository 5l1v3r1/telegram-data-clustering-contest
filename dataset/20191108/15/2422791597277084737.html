      <p>CHARLOTTETOWN -- The government of Prince Edward Island has reached a resolution with three whistleblowers whose private information was leaked by the province eight years ago.</p>
      <p>Three women sued the government after their private information was leaked in brown envelopes following a news conference they held alleging fraud and bribery in a provincial immigration program.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Six years later, a report by the privacy commissioner concluded that the province had breached the women's privacy rights.</p>
      <p>A government news release issued Thursday says litigation with Susan Holmes, Cora Plourd Nicholson and Svetlana Tenetko has now been resolved.</p>
      <p>The government says the terms of the settlement are confidential.</p>
      <p>Premier Dennis King says the women will be recognized as a driving force behind whistleblower legislation his government intends to proclaim this fall.</p>
