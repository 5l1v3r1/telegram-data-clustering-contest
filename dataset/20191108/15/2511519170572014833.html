      <h1>Liverpool vs Man City: Pep Guardiola says Reds are ‘strongest team in world’</h1>
      <h2>Jurgen Klopp‘s outfit are six points clear at the top of the Premier League heading into the weekend</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pep_Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> takes his <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> side to Anfield to face <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> this weekend and says the hosts are the best team on the planet right now.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s outfit are six points clear at the top of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> heading into the weekend, meaning the reigning champions must seek to take points off the Reds.</p>
      <p>It’s a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-vs-manchester-city-preview-prediction-salah-firmino-mane-migue-delaney-a9194631.html">classic matchup between the league’s two best sides</a>, but Guardiola says he has never faced a team like Liverpool before in his managerial career.</p>
      <p>Considering he has gone up against the likes of Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid, the Portuguese manager’s Champions League-winning Inter Milan side, Klopp’s own Borussia Dortmund and, more recently, Antonio Conte’s Premier League winners Chelsea, it’s high praise indeed.</p>
      <p>But this Liverpool side beats them all, Guardiola says, after being pushed to the limit last season to land the title.</p>
      <p>“Last season when we won the league, we won the Premier League [against] the best contender I ever faced in my career,” he said in his press conference.</p>
      <p>“This was one of the biggest achievements we achieved as a club.</p>
      <p>“Probably right now [Liverpool are] the strongest team in the world. Playing at Anfield, we know what it means for them and for all their rivals.</p>
      <p>“[But ]it’s 90 minutes and we’re going to try to follow the plan with thought in this game.”</p>
      <p>City go into the game with a couple of players missing from their regular strongest lineup, with David Silva and Aymeric Laporte injured and goalkeeper Ederson joining them this week.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian stopper went off against Atalanta in the Champions League in midweek, with his replacement Claudio Bravo being shown a red card in the second half</p>

      <p>Guardiola, though, says he has no worries over the Chilean playing at Anfield, pointing to his experience, his long career and the fact he regularly impresses in training.</p>
      <p>“Why should I not be confident with my players on my team? Why do you ask these kind of questions about having doubts because the regular [player] doesn’t play?</p>
      <p>“I would not like to be a player and my manager doubts me; I saw him every day in training sessions, how he fights, how good a goalkeeper he is.</p>
      <p>“We are not going to lose because of Claudio.</p>
      <p>“The red card from Atalanta is because we lost the ball in a dangerous situation.</p>
      <p>“You have to respect this guy, a career at a top, incredible level. He won the Copa America. He’s a top, top keeper. The first season was a struggle a little bit in a new league; it was because the team was not in the top level. The problem was not Claudio. It’s easy to point fingers. Why should I not have confidence?”</p>
