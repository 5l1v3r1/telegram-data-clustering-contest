      <p>Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane spoke in a news conference on Saturday ahead of his side's trip to Eibar in La Liga on Saturday (18.30h).</p>
      <p>He spoke about many subjects, including Gareth Bale and James Rodriguez's fitness and his recent comments about Kylian Mbappe.</p>
      <p><b>Leonardo's comments on Mbappe.</b> "I didn't say anything, only that the player expressed once that one day he would like to play for Real Madrid. Leonardo can say what he wants, as can I."</p>
      <p><b>Super Cup in Spain.</b> "It's the Federation who make the decision. We can't do anything, we just have to think about playing."</p>
      <p><b>injuries to Bale and James.</b> "They are not injured, they're not available. We will see if they're ready for their national teams or not. They will go with their respective countries and have six days to prepare. They're not available because they have not trained with the group. It's not a technical decision, they have not been with us."</p>
