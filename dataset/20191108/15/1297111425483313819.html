      <p>Saskatchewan may be new to the Toronto-based Lemon Bucket Orkestra, but one of the band’s 12 members knows the province well.</p>
      <p>Ian Tulloch was born and raised in Regina. He started playing the tuba in Grade 5 with the Lions Band, then joined his school band and the South Saskatchewan Youth Orchestra.</p>
      <p>After high school, Tulloch studied music education at the University of Regina, then taught band at Campbell Collegiate and its feeder schools. He also performed with the Regina Symphony Orchestra and the Pile of Bones Brass Band.</p>
      <p>In his five years with LBO, Tulloch hasn’t done much talking: “As the sousaphone player, I’m not the one who gets to do the interviews very often.”</p>
      <p>But he told us about the band, the music, and next week’s shows in Regina and Saskatoon.</p>

      <h3>Q: Can you describe your instrument — the sousaphone?</h3>
      <p><b>A:</b> “It’s much more common in the United States, especially the southern states where there’s a lot of marching bands and they do parades and halftime shows at football games and stuff. So the sousaphone is quite closely related to the tuba. … And the reason for the sousaphone rather than the tuba in Lemon Bucket Orkestra is just that it’s aesthetically a little bit more interesting, I guess.</p>
      <p>“The most common one that people would be able to recognize in popular culture would be the late night show with Jimmy Fallon. The Roots, they have a sousaphone in their band.”</p>
      <h3>Q: How did you end up joining the Lemon Bucket Orkestra?</h3>
      <p><b>A:</b> “When I left Regina, I went to Phoenix, Ariz. to pursue a master’s degree in music education. So I finished that degree, moved to Toronto and I was really expecting and hoping to get work as a teacher and just continue down that track with my life, but I found it very difficult to get teaching work in Toronto.</p>
      <p>“I did an interview for an early childhood music learning centre, and I didn’t get the job … but the owner of that school was recording a children’s album and he was interested in having some tuba on some of the songs.</p>
      <p>“A couple weeks later (I) got a phone call from this guy, saying that he was riding his bike down the street, he saw a brass band (Rambunctious) playing at a bar, and they didn’t have a tuba player. So he stopped, went in, introduced himself, exchanged my contact information with the band leader’s contact information.</p>
      <p>“I played with a couple of this band leader’s groups for maybe a year and a half or two years. And then the current sousaphone player for Lemon Bucket was planning to leave … I went to a few rehearsals and I went through a trial period and then started playing full time with Lemon Bucket.”</p>

      <h3>Q: A 12-piece band is a pretty big band. What’s it like touring together?</h3>
      <p><b>A:</b> “Right now, we’re on tour for about 18 days. … It’s a good amount of time that we can cover some territory, whether it’s like a tour like this in Western Canada or a small chunk of the United States. And it’s not so long that we all get sick of each other.</p>
      <p>“My first tour with the band was like, something dreadful, like three and a half months long or something. And that was really challenging.”</p>
      <h3>Q: Has LBO toured to Saskatchewan before?</h3>
      <p><b>A:</b> “No, that’s the one part of Canada that we haven’t been, I think Saskatchewan and Newfoundland. … I’m quite excited to show off my hometown to my bandmates.”</p>
      <h3>Q: What are you going to show them?</h3>
      <p><b>A:</b> “Well, we’ll see how our timing goes. … The usual things on the hit list, like my childhood home and elementary school (Argyle) and high school (Campbell).</p>
      <p>“I think that Wascana Lake is a pretty unique and interesting place to take people. I’m a big fan of the Bushwakker brewpub, so hopefully we’ll be able to stop in there. And really just the people … (It) will be good to reconnect and connect my current friend group with some from the past.”</p>
      <h3>Q: Lemon Bucket Orkestra’s official description is “Balkan-Klezmer-Gypsy-Party-Punk Super-Band” — but how would you describe the sound?</h3>
      <p><b>A:</b> “The easiest way to describe it usually is to say that were Eastern European folk music, or Balkan brass music. … We’re definitely more traditional than (Gogol Bordello). But we do have like a certain edginess or aggressiveness or party appeal that the super traditional bands don’t have.</p>
      <p>“I think that the best way is to just come to the show and figure out what it is.”</p>

      <h3>Q: What can audiences expect from your show?</h3>
      <p><b>A:</b> “They can expect high energy; they can expect dancing; they can expect beautiful singing. It’s really a very diverse show; we cover a lot of different styles and there’s some line dancing or Serbian circle dancing. There’s screaming, there’s clapping, there’s pretty much everything you could imagine.</p>
      <p>“The singers are Ukrainian in background and we have quite a few Ukrainian songs. We also have songs that are sung in Russian and Serbian and Macedonian. We play some music from Greece, but I don’t think there’s any singing. And same for Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>“There’s no English singing at the show.”</p>
