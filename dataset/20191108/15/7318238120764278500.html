      <p>Green and socialist MEPs are calling for a mandatory food-labelling scheme to be introduced across the EU to tackle obesity.</p>
      <p>MEPs and several civil society groups are calling on the European Commission to make food retailers adopt the colour coded Nutri-Score system which tells consumers how healthy their food is.</p>
      <p>The scheme labels food with scores A-E and colours from green to red to demonstrate how healthy what they are eating is.</p>
      <p>It was first developed by the French public health agency Sante Publique France and officially adopted by the French government in 2017.</p>
      <p>Serge Hercberg, professor of nutrition at University Paris 13 Nord, was one of the team who developed Nutriscore.</p>
      <p>He told Euronews: “If it is imposed on all products, a study from France has shown that the EU would reduce nutrition related deaths by around 3.4% every year.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>“This would mean 7,500 fewer deaths from these chronic diseases in which nutrition plays a role [per year].</p>
      <p>”So there is a real public health issue”.</p>
      <p>Consumer groups have welcomed the move.</p>
      <p>Monique Goyens, the director-general of the European Consumer Bureau, said: “There is a growing interest [in the idea] and the Commission is obliged by the 2011 regulations to introduce a review process for nutritional food value, so why not propose the introduction of a mandatory Nutri-Score at European level?</p>
      <p>“It would mean harmonising so that all producers are actually subject to the same rules. And that's good for competition, the internal market and it's good for the consumers. "</p>
