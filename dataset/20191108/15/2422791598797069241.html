      <p>JOHANNESBURG -- An earthbound jet known as the Bloodhound became one of the world's 10 fastest cars this week, on target for its goal to set a new land speed record.</p>
      <p>The Grafton LSR company announced the development in a news release this week. Spokesman Jules Tipler says Bloodhound's next goal is to reach 885 kilometres per hour, possibly in the coming week. Powered by a Rolls-Royce EJ200 jet engine, the car hurtles so fast across the salt pan track that a twin parachute is needed to stop it.</p>
      <p>Over the next year, the car aims to break the world land speed record of 1,228 kph. That record was set in 1997.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Bloodhound's jet engine will be boosted by a rocket engine with an aim to safely reach 1,610 kph (1,000 mph).</p>
