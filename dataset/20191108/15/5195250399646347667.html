      <h3>Honda Civic continued to dominate the executive sedan segment’s sales as it scored nearly twice as much tally as the Octavia</h3>
      <p>Honda Cars India introduced the tenth generation Civic in early March 2019 and made an impressive comeback that reflected on its first-month sales volume. With more than 2,200 units, the Civic did send shockwaves to the competitors before maintaining a steady monthly average.</p>
      <p>In October 2019, the Civic did lead the sales charts by garnering a total of 436 units while Skoda’s Octavia finished second with 231 units. The Czech Republican sedan registered a total that was good enough for 24% YoY growth when compared to October 2018 when only 186 units were retailed.</p>
      <p>The Toyota Corolla stood third with cumulative domestic sales of 90 units as against 242 units during the corresponding month last year with YoY decline of 63%. Despite receiving a facelift a few weeks ago, Hyundai’s Elantra ended last by garnering just 59 units as against 115 units during the same month last year with 49% de-growth.</p>

      <p><b>DataSource :</b> AutoPunditz<br/>The segment as a whole posted 816 units as against 543 units in October 2018 with an appreciable sales increase of 50%. The Elantra facelift entered the market as the country’s first connected sedan with Blue Link technology and a host of visual updates and interior changes as well as feature additions.</p>
      <p>The Octavia is expected to get a brand new generation sometime next year in India and globally it is waiting make its debut on November 11 at Prague. The Corolla, on the other hand, received a thorough makeover in the international markets recently and reports suggest that it could be launched in India by the middle of next year.</p>

      <p>In recent years, the D-segment for sedans has seen decreased popularity due to the arrival of premium SUVs, just as the C-segment comprising of Honda City, Maruti Suzuki Ciaz, Skoda Rapid, Toyota Yaris and Volkswagen Vento. We do expect the new-gen Octavia and Corolla to revive the segment’s fortunes, in a similar fashion to the Honda Civic.</p>
