      <h1>Mamas &amp; Papas goes into administration just six days after Mothercare</h1>
      <h2>The company, which had 27 stores and three concessions, said its remaining stores will continue to trade as normal, as well as its digital, wholesale and concession arms</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:45:38+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>High street childrenswear chain Mamas &amp; Papas has gone into administration <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-mothercare-collapses-administration-putting-20630942">just days after Mothercare's collapse</a>.</p>
      <p>The retailer has axed six stores and made 73 staff redundant with immediate effect - a further 54 roles are now at risk at its Huddersfield head office.</p>
      <p>Bluegem Capital, which has owned the business since 2014, has bought the company assets through a pre-pack administration which will cut some of its financial liabilities.</p>
      <p>Mamas &amp; Papas said its unprofitable stores in Aberdeen, Preston, Milton Keynes, Lincoln, Leamington and Fareham closed on Friday as a result.</p>
      <p>The administration, conducted by Deloitte, came after it was put under pressure as its shoppers moved online and high street footfall continued to decline.</p>
      <p>The company, which had 27 stores and three concessions, said its remaining stores will continue to trade as normal, as well as its digital, wholesale and concession arms.</p>

      <p>However, it has announced plans to "simplify" operations at its head office in Huddersfield, which could lead to further job losses.</p>
      <p>It was founded in 1981 in Huddersfield by David and Luisa Scacchetti and rapidly grew but was bought by Bluegem after a restructuring process five years ago.</p>
      <p>Riccardo Cincotta, executive chairman of Mamas &amp; Papas, said: "These actions are always difficult but they are also necessary in a challenging market to ensure Mamas &amp; Papas achieves its considerable future potential.</p>
      <p>"We remain fully focused on maintaining our position as the UK's most popular nursery brand.</p>
      <p>"We will continue to review our store portfolio in the light of customers' changing behaviour and we remain fully committed to an omni-channel offering that reflects their evolving needs."</p>
      <p>The retailer said all customer orders, including outstanding orders placed with the closed stores, are unaffected by the administration and will be "delivered on time without disruption".</p>
