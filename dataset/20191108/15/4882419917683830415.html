      <p>Robert Moreno spoke in a press conference on Friday after naming his Spain squad for the upcoming games against Romania and Malta.</p>
      <p>Among other things, he spoke about Barcelona's Ansu Fati, who could go the European Championships with the senior squad next summer despite currently being with the U21s.</p>
      <p><b>Ansu Fati at Euro 2020:</b> "He's on the pre-list although he's not with us now. He's a special player who could be called up, why not?"</p>
      <p><b>Pique and the Olympic Games:</b> "It's something I can't control (U21 coach Luis de la Fuente will make the decision). He's already announced his retirement from Spain, which we respect."</p>
      <p><b>Gabriel Paulista:</b> "I'm aware they're applying for a passport, he's still can't be (called up). It's welcome if it is an option."</p>
      <p><b>Dani Olmo:</b> "He's doing really well in his league and above all in the Champions League. We're happy to be able to have him with us."</p>
