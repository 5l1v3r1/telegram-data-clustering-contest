      <p>A hero firefighter has saved the lives of an elderly Plymouth couple being "slowly poisoned" by carbon monoxide - all in a day's work.</p>
      <p>Daryll Kearney, a firefighter and all round top bloke, was on a routine home safety visit to a "vulnerable" couple on Thursday afternoon who were <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/follow-simple-steps-prevent-carbon-3359527">worried their carbon monoxide alarm</a> was faulty.</p>
      <p>After checking the house "top to toe", and replacing the alarm as a precaution, Daryll left and went onto his next job.</p>
      <p>But not long after the 30-year-old, who is a retained firefighter at Crownhill Fire Station and also works as a home safety technician, had packed up his things and left, the new alarm started beeping.</p>
      <p>The elderly couple, who now knew what to do after being given important advice by Daryll, who has previously worked in the military and for the ambulance service, dialled 999 and waited outside for them to arrive.</p>
      <p>Firefighters at the scene soon discovered an old storage heater in the kitchen was leaking the poisonous gas - "slowly poisoning" the couple.</p>
      <p>"They could have died," said Daryll, who joined the fire service in 2013. "When my crew manager Stuart [Higgins] rang to say I'd just saved their lives, it felt incredible. That's why I do what I do, to prevent situations like this.</p>
      <p>"I always put myself before others and I love my job. I always wanted to work for the fire brigade, it was my dream."</p>

      <p>Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that has no smell or taste. Breathing it in can make you unwell, and it can kill if you're exposed to high levels.</p>
      <p>It is produced when fuels such as gas, oil, coal and wood do not burn fully. Burning charcoal, running cars and the smoke from cigarettes also produce carbon monoxide gas.</p>
      <p>Stuart, the crew manager at Crownhill Fire Station said the gas "would have slowly poisoned [the couple]".</p>
      <p>"There's no doubt about that," he added.</p>
      <p>Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service has been offering free home safety visits for about three years, subject to eligibility.</p>
      <p>The visit takes less than 30 minutes, and trained firefighters provide advice and fit a free smoke detector if required. The number to call, which will take no longer than five minutes, is <b>0800 05 02 999</b>.</p>

      <p>Daryll, who was back on the job on Friday morning, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/fire-service-statement-after-blaze-3516020">fighting a huge fire in Plympton</a>, which had spread through three homes, said he hopes by sharing this story more people will get in touch to book home safety visits and realise how life-saving they could potentially be.</p>
      <p>He explained the couple had been suffering with headaches and nausea, but hadn't realised why until the carbon monoxide leak was found.</p>
      <p>Giving advice to members of the public, he said: "If your carbon monoxide alarm goes off, call 999 immediately and leave the premises.</p>
      <p>"If you're not sure if your carbon monoxide alarm is working, or if it's not in the right place, call us.</p>
      <p>"Carbon monoxide can kill."</p>
