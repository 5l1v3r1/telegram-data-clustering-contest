      <p>Rebekah Vardy seemed in high spirits as she showed off her baby bump while out and about in London today.</p>
      <p>The mum-to-be, 37, sported a tight brown dress that clung to her growing belly as she hung out with some friends in the capital.</p>
      <p>She teamed her frock, which reached down to her ankles, with a pair of rust coloured boots and a cream coat.</p>
      <p>Rebekah, who is pregnant with her fifth child, carried a pale pink handbag and wore her long brunette locks in a side plait for the casual outing.</p>
      <p>Despite a difficult couple of months, she looked cheerful and was seen laughing with her pals as they hung out.</p>

      <p>Rebekah and her footballer husband were forced to cut their recent holiday to Dubai short when she was accused of selling stories on fellow WAG Coleen Rooney, something she denies.</p>
      <p>Coleen and Rebekah have been at loggerheads ever since her accusations.</p>
      <p>Wayne Rooney's wife was nicknamed Wagatha Christie in the wake of the scandal after unveiling her detective work.</p>

      <p>She said she had planted false stories on her private <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account and revealed in an epic statement that she'd blocked every account but Rebekah's from viewing her Stories to test whether or not the information would leak.</p>
      <p>And when they did, she told the world what had happened in a bombshell statement that went viral.</p>
      <p>Rebekah has vehemently denied leaking stories about Coleen and said in her own statement that she was "disgusted" that she even had to deny it, especially when she's heavily pregnant.</p>

      <p>She was so upset that she cut her Dubai holiday short and flew back home.</p>
      <p>Becky claimed she has hired a forensic IT expert to prove her innocence and is considering legal action.</p>
      <p>But representatives for Coleen say she has irrefutable evidence that the leaks came from Rebekah's account.</p>
