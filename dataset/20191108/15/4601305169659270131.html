      <p>Haven't had a chance to read the entire Mueller Report on foreign interference in America's 2016 presidential elections? It matters even more now that the impeachment of Donald Trump is proceeding.</p>
      <p>Now the report has been adapted to podcast form, by Lawfare, featuring a special group of journalists. Really worth a listen, whether or not you've read any of it.</p>
      <p>“Here it all is,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Susan_Hennessey/status/1192792247844126723">tweeted</a> Lawfare Executive Editor Susan Hennessy. “The entire Mueller Report adapted into a podcast narrative, told by the journalists who broke the stories and experts providing legal context.”</p>
      <p>“15 episodes, 13.5 hours. Give it a listen. It matters now more than ever.”</p>
      <p>From the <a href="https://shows.pippa.io/the-report/">show's tease</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>On April 18th 2019, the Justice Department released the redacted Mueller Report to the public. The 448 page document details a story that has captured America's attention. From Russian plots to interfere in our election to constitutional questions of executive power, the Mueller Report is potentially one of the most important and consequential documents of our time. But there's a problem. Very few people have read it.<br/><br/>There is still so much confusion about the Report. What it says, who it implicates, and what it means for our country. At Lawfare, we are distilling the report into a multi part audio narrative series, telling you the story of what is in this document, the story Mueller wants you to understand.</blockquote>
