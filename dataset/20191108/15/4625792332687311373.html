      <p>Jane Fonda asked Ivanka Trump if she could bring attractive women to the Oval Office to convince President Trump to battle climate change.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Vice, Fonda said she planned to bring beautiful women and scientists to feed Trump’s ego.</p>
      <p>“I got this idea that you know, maybe if I went into his office with several extremely attractive, very, very smart women who know and care about the climate, and a few scientists, and maybe if we got on our knees, and we said to him, ‘Donald, you will be the global hero for all-time if you do what’s right about [the climate],” Fonda said.</p>

      <p>Fonda explained that she had contacted Jared Kushner and asked him about her plot, but was told, “Ivanka’s the environmentalist in the family.” Fonda claimed Kushner wouldn’t help with her climate agenda because he is “married to the Saudis.”</p>
      <p>She then reached out to Ivanka Trump and claimed she was told, “Well, let me see what I can do.” Trump never returned her call.</p>
      <p>Fonda has been arrested at the U.S. capitol every Friday for the <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/were-going-to-get-arrested-every-friday-jane-fonda-handcuffed-on-us-capitol-steps-during-climate-change-protest">past several weeks</a></u> as part of her “Fire Drill Friday” effort to bring awareness to climate change.</p>
