      <p>Spain U21 coach Luis de la Fuente, who will be in charge of La Roja's U23 side at the Olympic Games, says it's good news many big players want to be involved in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>First Sergio Ramos said he would like to play for Spain at the Games and then Gerard Pique suggested he would be open to the option if called up.</p>
      <p>"I say the same as I said with Sergio Ramos," de la Fuente said about Pique. "We are happy that they want to come, but we will see what decisions are made.</p>
      <p>"The players that come will be the ones that we want in function to their performance and we are open to these possibilities."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Spain coach Robert Moreno indicated that he's not hoping to have Pique back for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>"Pique is a great player, but he has already retired from the national team so we're not planning to have him back," Moreno said in a news conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>Barcelona defender Pique called time on his international career after Spain's World Cup campaign in Russia last summer.</p>
