        <b>When it comes to driving in the UK, there’s arguably nothing more annoying than middle lane-hoggers.</b>
      </p>

      <p>You know, the people who continually drive in the middle lane, no matter how few cars are in the left-hand lane, people who inevitably slow down everyone by getting in the way and not tucking back into the left-hand lane.</p>
      <p>Well, middle lane-hoggers might think twice after learning of one driver, who is now facing a £100 fine for driving along the middle lane of a motorway for three miles, unaware he was being tailed by a police car.</p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <p>The driver was travelling along lane two of the M20 in Kent, refusing to pull into the nearside lane as required by law.</p>

      <p>When he was pulled over by police, the male driver refused to admit he’d done anything wrong.</p>
      <p>Because he didn’t see the error of his ways, officers from Kent Police issued him with a Traffic Offence Report and a warning that he faces prosecution for careless driving.</p>
      <p>In addition to the £100 fine, the motorist also faces having three penalty points put on his licence, which would no doubt lead to higher insurance premiums.</p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <p>Kent Police tweeted with the photo: ‘This driver was stopped having driven for a colossal 3.050 miles in Lane 2 of the M20 without any other vehicles about. The driver refused to accept that this was Careless Driving. TOR issued.’</p>
      <p>Rules 137 and 138 of the Highway Code state that on dual carriageways and motorways, drivers are obliged to keep to the left-hand lane, although the middle or right-hand lane can be used to overtake.</p>

      <p>According to Rule 137: ‘On a two-lane dual carriageway you should stay in the left-hand lane. Use the right-hand lane for overtaking or turning right. After overtaking, move back to the left-hand lane when it is safe to do so.’</p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <p>According to Rule 138: ‘On a three-lane dual carriageway, you may use the middle lane or the right-hand lane to overtake but return to the middle and then the left-hand lane when it is safe.’</p>
      <p>Drivers then must move over to the left whenever it is safe to do so.</p>
      <p>In real terms, this means motorists can only sit in the middle or right-hand lane when traffic dictates.</p>
