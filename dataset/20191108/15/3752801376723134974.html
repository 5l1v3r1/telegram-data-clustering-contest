      <h1>PIC | 'Are you deaf?' - Olympic swimming hero Terence Parkin allegedly attacked in road rage incident</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:01:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:01</time> by <a rel="author">Riaan Grobler</a></address>
      <p>Celebrated South African swimmer and Olympic medallist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Parkin">Terence Parkin</a> has been allegedly attacked in what appears to be a road rage incident.</p>
      <p>Parkin, who is deaf, won a silver medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in the 200m breaststroke and holds the record for the number of medals won at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaflympics">Deaflympics</a>.</p>
      <p>In videos which have been circulating on Facebook, taken from what appears to be a dash cam in Parkin's vehicle, a man in a silver BMW 7-series can be seen swerving from left to right in an attempt to push Parkin's car into oncoming traffic.</p>
      <p>In another video, which Parkin recorded on a mobile device, the cars are stationary and the man confronts Parkin as the former Olympian gestures in sign language.</p>
      <p>"You need to see a doctor," the man says. "Are you deaf?"</p>
      <p>The man then appears to assault Parkin, but the visuals are not clear as Parkin loses control of his recording device during the alleged attack.</p>

      <p>In subsequent videos, taken at a service station, Parkin is visibly injured, bleeding from the nose. He again gestures in the direction of the man, who is sitting in his vehicle.</p>
      <p>Just before driving off, the man tells Parkin: "Now you need to get a doctor, huh? Because I think you're mental. Mentally you're not right."</p>
      <p>It is unknown when and where the incident took place.</p>
      <p>The videos, which had in excess of 250 000 views, have since been removed from social media.</p>
      <p>News24 attempted to get comment from Parkin's wife, Ingrid, who said she would not comment on the incident as an investigation was pending.</p>
      <p>The Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, of which Parkin is an <a href="http://www.fondationprincessecharlene.mc/en/ambassadors-advisors/terence-parkin?fbclid=IwAR2XiNID7M81nx-g8GPUm_VYEWoQ7ROfragNeeGVZx_XD4-uClTVQjdtAiQ">ambassador</a>, told News24 it was not aware of the incident.</p>
      <p>In 2001, Parkin saved a seven-year-old boy from drowning after he reportedly got sucked in by a swimming pool vent at a Johannesburg gym, <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Olympic-swimmer-saves-boy-20110121">Sport24</a> reported.</p>
