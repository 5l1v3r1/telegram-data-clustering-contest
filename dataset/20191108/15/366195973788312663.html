      <p>One of the primary voices of Memphis hip-hop, Blac Youngsta is often looked over because of <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/blac-youngsta-celebrates-his-birthday-like-only-he-can-news.76724.html">his outrageous social media antics</a>. The man could have likely made it as a stand-up comedian, telling the most hilarious stories and generally just acting a fool online at all times. Instead of becoming a professional funnyman though, Blac Youngsta opted to pick up the microphone and be a recording artist. Despite his comical behavior, the 29-year-old often gets serious when he's rapping. Not much is different on his new single "So What."</p>
      <p>Coming through with his latest record, Blac Youngsta is back with his first drop of the month. For the last two months, the heavy-hitter has been flooding the streets with music and we're hoping "So What" serves as a proper indication that a full-length project is on the way.</p>
