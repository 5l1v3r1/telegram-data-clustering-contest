        <b>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has admitted that the vicious attack on Irish Reds fan Sean Cox in 2018 was the “lowest point” of his tenure at Anfield.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/kennedymarisa760/sean-cox-charity-legends-game/">Cox</a> suffered devastating head injuries when he was attacked in a random assault by a masked AS Roma supporter outside Liverpool’s stadium in April 2018.</p>
      <p>Liverpool CEO Peter Moore confirmed that Cox and his family would be in attendance on Sunday as Liverpool take on Manchester City in one of the biggest games of the Premier League season so far.</p>

      <p>“We’re delighted to welcome Sean and his family back to Anfield,” said Moore earlier this week</p>
      <p>“I am sure it will be an emotional return for the family; however, the club has worked closely with the Cox family to ensure that their visit is made as easy as possible, and that they are given all the space and comfort that they need.</p>
      <p>“The way that our fans have supported Sean and the Cox family is a testament to their commitment to the LFC family, and we know this will be the case again on Sunday.”</p>
      <p>Cox is a lifelong Liverpool fan and he had spent the last 18 months receiving treatment in Ireland before recently moving to a specialist neurological facility in the north of England.</p>

      <p>Speaking ahead of Liverpool’s clash with Manchester City, Klopp <a href="https://twitter.com/IanDoyleSport/status/1192784496812314624?s=20">admitted that the time of the incident was one of the most difficult periods of his Anfield career.</a></p>
      <blockquote>“When it happened to Sean it was probably the lowest point of my whole time at Liverpool because something like this shouldn’t happen in general in life, and shouldn’t happen around a football game.</blockquote>
      <p>“I hope the love Sean has for his football team has given him strength. He still has a long way to go. That he wants to come back and watch a game is now one of my real highlights. I am really looking forward to it. I hope we can arrange I speak to him before game, I want to.</p>
