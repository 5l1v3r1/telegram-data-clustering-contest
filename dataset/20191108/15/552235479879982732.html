      <h1>Neil Lennon makes Celtic transfer pledge as he pays tribute to fans after Lazio heroics</h1>
      <h2>The Northern Irishman was full of praise for his players but also had a special mention for the travelling support.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:06:16+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon has paid tribute to the travelling <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fans after last night's heroics in Rome.</p>
      <p>The Parkhead side made a remarkable comeback to take all three points against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> and qualify for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> last-32 with two games to spare.</p>
      <p>James Forrest cancelled out Ciro Immobile's opener, before super sub Olivier Ntcham snatched the victory in stoppage time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a> was also full of praise for his players, but had a special mention for the away support who made it all the way to Italy.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman also insisted the club will strengthen in the January transfer window to help them prepare for the knockout stages.</p>

      <p>He said: "I've not really had a chance to reflect on the result, we got in very late this morning. The immediate feelings are of immense pride and happiness."</p>
      <p>"The qualification is a huge feather in our caps and the performances in the four games from the players have been immense.</p>
      <p>"I didn't think we'd qualify as quickly. They showed great resilience last night. Some of the football we played and the chances we created, it was a real step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"A huge credit goes to the supporters. It felt like the real Celtic. That connection with the fans and the players was there. There was a real pride for me last night. To send them home happy was as good for me as getting the result.</p>
      <p>"It's the sum of all parts. We've got a great young and dynamic coaching staff here. Their work ethic is fantastic and the players themselves are playing brilliantly.</p>

      <p>"It's a long way off, it's after the January window and we'll look to strengthen again. Going forward we are a threat against anyone."</p>
      <p>And the Hoops boss also provided an injury update on a host of stars and admits Leigh Griffiths could return against Motherwell on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He added: "Griffiths could feature. Rogic we're hoping will be back and Mikey has a small chance too. Hatem will get a scan tomorrow but we don't think he'll be fit for the game."</p>
