      <h1>Google Pixel 4 Black Friday Deals Imminent Based on Leaked Ad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:00:30+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>If you've had your eye on the new Pixel 4 smartphones, hold off for a couple weeks and you could be in for a big discount.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dsy8jg/pixel_4_bfcm_price_leaked_via_google_ad_200_off/">redditor</a> has reportedly spotted an ad for a $200 discount on the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/pixel-4-review-it-wins-by-being-more-human/">Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</a> at the Google Store. They posted a screenshot of the banner which states that customers can take advantage of the reduced price until December 2.</p>

      <p>The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are priced at £669 and £829 respectively at the Google store, and if that $200 discount translates to a direct GBP equivalent, we're looking at around £156 off. However, considering we usually get shafted on prices over here, I wouldn't expect a like-for-like conversion.</p>
      <p>If Google is dropping the price, we may see the handsets cheaper at other retailers too - it is almost Black Friday after all, a holiday that means diddly squat but has been co-opted to give everyone an excuse to blow their cash load before Christmas.</p>
      <p>You may want to read up on some potential Pixel 4 problems before you snap one up though, like the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/does-the-pixel-4-have-a-bending-issue/">possible bending issue</a>, as well as some <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/pixel-4-stupid-issues-google-not-trying-hard-enough/">basic niggles</a> that really should've been ironed out by now.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, there's the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/the-pixel-4s-astrophotography-mode-is-pure-witchcraft/">impressive astrophotography mode</a>, so it's swings and roundabouts. Either way, keep an eye out for more <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/search?searchTerm=black+friday+">Black Friday discounts right here</a>.
