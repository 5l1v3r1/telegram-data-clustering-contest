      <p>Scally's SuperValu in Clonakilty has seen off stiff international competition as the winner in the Diversity &amp; Inclusion category of the 2019 Institute of Grocery Distribution Awards.</p>
      <p>The Clonakilty supermarket took home the award ahead of global brands such as Coca-Cola and retail groups such as the Co-Op Group.</p>
      <p>Scally's SuperValu has provided specialised training to staff and organised autism-friendly shopping nights as part of the supermarket's work in championing autism initiatives.</p>
      <p>Last year, Scally's worked with autism charity AsIAm and other Clonakilty businesses to gain recognition for Clonakilty as Ireland's first autism-friendly town. 10 other Irish towns have since been given autism-friendly status, while 90 other SuperValu stores now offer tailored services for people with autism.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the win, Eugene Scally said: “I am delighted to accept the IGD Award for Diversity &amp; Inclusion award on behalf of all the hard-working, dedicated team in Scally’s SuperValu. Winning this award demonstrates that by working together with our customers and the local community in Clonakilty to introduce autism-friendly initiatives, we can make a real, positive difference to people’s lives.”</p>
