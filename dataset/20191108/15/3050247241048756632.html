      <h1>Chinese Police Hold MicroBT CEO Allegedly Over Dispute With Bitmain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:11:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Martin</a></address>
      <p>The founder of Bitcoin mining rig manufacturer MicroBT is being held as of Nov. 8 by Shenzhen Police to assist in an investigation, according to a local news <a href="https://www.theblockbeats.com/news/4444?from=singlemessage&amp;isappinstalled=0">source</a>. Police are likely to be questioning Zuoxing Yang over allegations of intellectual property infringement regarding the technology of Beijing-based <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitmain">Bitmain</a>.</p>
      <h3>Previous allegations of patent infringement</h3>
      <p>Yang previously worked at Bitmain as processor design director, and developed the Antminer S7 and S9 models. Allegedly unhappy after talks over stock options fell through, Yang left, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-08/ex-bitmain-chip-designer-takes-on-crypto-s-mining-goliath">raised</a> $20 million to found MicroBT.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Bitmain sued the company over alleged infringement of a patent. However, Yang’s lawyers successfully appealed to have the patent revoked the following year.</p>
      <h3>Did Jihan Wu instigate the renewed investigations?</h3>
      <p>A source said that it was unclear why the police had resumed investigations at this time. However, the timing of Yang’s detention, coming just after the unexpected return of co-founder Jihan Wu to Bitmain, may suggest that Wu could be involved.</p>
      <p>Wu returned to the company at the end of October, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmain-ceo-ousts-co-founder-biggest-shareholder-to-save-the-ship">ousting</a> fellow co-founder and biggest shareholder, Micree Zhan. Wu publicly dismissed Zhan of all duties last month, warning that any staff still communicating with him may be fired.</p>
