      <p>The officer in charge of the case said that the boys attending the course were all young offenders and were there by appointment but he was not aware of any specific security at the event.</p>
      <p>The Tory-led council is in the constituency of Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a>.</p>
      <p>A Met Police spokeswoman said: "The event was a knife awareness course."</p>
      <p>A teenager, who knew Hakim from secondary school, said he was a "caring" person who enjoyed dancing and freestyle rapping and was know among friends for his freestyle videos.</p>

      <p>She said: "He was always smiling and he was always so positive. He was a lovely caring guy.</p>
      <p>"He was a student at college, I think he was studying sports.</p>
      <p>"He used to do freestlye and he wanted to be a rapper. He thought he could rap, he thought he could dance. Everybody loved him.</p>
      <p>"I knew him since year eight of school. He had a sister, I think he had younger siblings."</p>
      <p>The teenager said she discovered the news of Hakim's murder in the early hours of this morning.</p>
      <p>She added: "I went to bed really early and when I woke up at 3am everybody had posted it on social media.</p>
      <p>"It is very sad, he was the nicest guy."</p>

      <p>DCI Noel McHugh, leading the investigation, said that as far as he knew the young men attending the event weren't searched for weapons.</p>
      <p>He said: "They were in the Civic Centre and were all young males. They were there by appointment. They were young offenders.</p>
      <p>"It was a group session and a very quick altercation occurred between two individuals which resulted in one mail sustaining a knife injury which would cost him his life.</p>
      <p>"My understanding is that it was a council event and there was no screening process but my understanding is that they would have carried out their own risk assessments."</p>
      <p>However, he added: "I wasn't there, they may have done.</p>
      <p>"During the attack an independent unconnected male tried to intervene and break up the fight and that male sustained a stab injury.</p>
      <p>"He has been treated and has since been released from hospital.</p>

      <p>"The family are broken, absolutely broken. Obviously this isn't their words, it's my interpretation. I met them last night and they are absolutely broken - it doesn't feel real.</p>
      <p>"What we can say is that as a result of very quick policing response this individual was traced and arrested and is currently in custody and will be interviewed this afternoon.</p>
      <p>"It's very early days. We are speaking to witnesses and are understanding what actually took place.</p>

      <p>"It is not known if they were known to each other. We're looking into their lifestyle and their associations."</p>
      <p>Staff and others attending the event have been trying to cope with the horrific incident.</p>
      <p>DCI McHugh said: "The individuals we have spoken to are absolutely shocked and are coming to terms with the loss of such a young life so tragically."</p>
      <p>The weapon used in the attack has not been found.</p>
