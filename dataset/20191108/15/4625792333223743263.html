      <p>Donald Trump Jr. said a visit to Arlington National Cemetery on the day before his father was inaugurated reminded him of the attacks directed at his family and the future business sacrifices they would have to make.</p>
      <p>"I rarely get emotional, if ever. I guess you'd call me hyper-rational, stoic. Yet, as we drove past the rows of white grave markers, in the gravity of the moment, I had a deep sense of the importance of the presidency and a love of our country ... In that moment, I also thought of all the attacks we'd already suffered as a family, and about all the sacrifices we'd have to make to help my father succeed — voluntarily giving up a huge chunk of our business and all international deals to avoid the appearance that we were 'profiting off of the office,’” President Trump’s eldest son <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-jr-new-book-about-how-he-feels-like-victim-2019-11">wrote in his book</a>, <i>Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.</i></p>
      <p>"Frankly, it was a big sacrifice, costing us millions and millions of dollars annually ... Of course, we didn't get any credit whatsoever from the mainstream media, which now does not surprise me at all,” Trump Jr. wrote.</p>
      <p>More than 400,000 active duty service members, veterans, and their family members are buried at the cemetery on the edge of Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>The president kept ownership of his business when he entered the White House, and the Trump Organization has continued to make money from international deals. He still holds more than $130 million in foreign assets, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/06/trump-foreign-business-interests/">according to an analysis</a>.</p>
      <p>The Trump Organization, of which Trump Jr., is executive vice president, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/trump-scotland-golf-course.html">received approval</a> in September for a major expansion of its golf resort near Aberdeen, Scotland.</p>
