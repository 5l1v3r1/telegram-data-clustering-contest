      <p>Between <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../red-dead-redemption-2-is-just-as-lovely-on-pc-571462.phtml"><i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i></a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-death-stranding-568760.phtml"><i>Death Stranding</i></a>, and now <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-american-truck-simulator-337137.phtml"><i>American Truck Simulator</i></a>, it's going to be a methodical weekend in gaming. Those first two titles need no introduction – they just launched on PC and PS4, respectively – but what's that other game doing here? It's three years old at this point!</p>
      <p>Well, <i>American Truck Simulator </i>does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1104880/American_Truck_Simulator__Utah/">Utah DLC out this week</a>, so that's part of it. (I can't believe I learned Utah is considered the Beehive State from not just <i>a</i> video game, but <i>this </i>video game). More to the point though, SCS Software's eternal truck-driving sim is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/270880/American_Truck_Simulator/">free to play for the weekend</a>.</p>

      <p>If you've ever thought that maybe, just maybe, you could adopt the trucker lifestyle, here's your chance. <i>American Truck Simulator </i>is free to play on Steam until Monday, November 11 at 10:00am Pacific.</p>
      <p>I appreciate it when free promos like this can help us expand our horizons beyond cowboys and Kojima.</p>
