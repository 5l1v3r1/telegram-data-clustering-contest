        <b>Accusations of anti-Semitism against Labour and its leadership have plagued the party since the election of Jeremy Corbyn in 2015. The political leader has since made efforts to combat anti-Semitic behaviour within the party.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Labour Party councillor running to become the MP for Clacton dropped his candidacy on Friday for the General Election after being accused of making <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911051077230575-fact-check-first-michael-gove-slammed-for-fuelling-antisemitism-row-around-corbyn-labour/">an anti-Semitic comment</a>.</p>
      <p>Gideon Bull said it is not currently the best time to stand for election following accusations against that him that he made a reference to Shylock, a Jewish moneylender in William Shakespeare's The Merchant Of Venice often considered an offensive portrayal of Jews, during a Haringey Council cabinet meeting back in July.</p>
      <blockquote>"The allegation that I called a Jewish cabinet member 'Shylock' is entirely false" he said in a statement, claiming that it was analogy used in reference to a housing decision and not any other member of the council. </blockquote>
      <p>"When she politely informed me that this saying was offensive, I immediately apologised and explained that I did not know that Shylock was Jewish and I would never have mentioned Shylock if I had known this", he said.</p>
      <blockquote>"I grew up in a working class area in Ilford where this was a common saying, but I didn't know it was offensive".</blockquote>
      <p>"This was a genuine accident and I reiterate my sincere apology for this mistake".</p>
      <p>The comment was reported by fellow councillor Zena Brabazon, reportedly the target of the remark.</p>
      <p>The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism's head of political and government investigations, Joe Glasman condemned Mr Bull's comment as "unacceptable".</p>
      <p>Glasman then directed further accusations against the Labour Party as a whole saying: "Not a day goes by without a revelation about a Labour candidate's troubling record in relation to Jews, exemplifying the institutional anti-Semitism of the party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn".</p>
      <p>It has also been alleged that Gideon had previously used racial slurs "ni****s" and "P***s".</p>

      <p>​This comes a day after Kate Ramsden, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910281077166969-out-of-touch-remainer-from-london-picked-as-labour-candidate-in-pro-leave-constituency/">another Labour candidate</a>, stood down in Aberdeenshire following accusations of anti-Semitism for comparing Israel to an "abused child" who becomes an abusive adult.</p>
      <p>Ms Ramsden, however, apologised following her decision to withdraw, saying it was never her intention and that she can understand "why many Jewish people have been hurt by my words".</p>
      <p>Former Parliament Speaker John Bercow, himself Jewish, said yesterday that he does not believe Jeremy Corbyn is an anti-Semite but that the party does have a "challenge" to overcome, stating during an interview with Alistair Campbell for GQ Magazine: “I’m not saying that he doesn’t have a challenge in his party… I respect those who are very concerned about it, but I don’t believe Jeremy Corbyn is anti-Semitic".</p>
      <p>In July, during an emergence shadow cabinet meeting, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn issued an order accelerate the removal of anti-Semites from Labour‘s ranks, and vowed to confront <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911081077256702-buzz-as-britains-oldest-jewish-newspaper-pleads-not-to-vote-for-anti-semite-corbyn/">the "poison" of anti-Semitism</a>.</p>
      <p>Corbyn has said that the Labour Party has a zero-tolerance policy for anti-Semitism in the party and has issued guidelines for Labour Party members to follow regarding opposing anti-Jewish sentiment.</p>
