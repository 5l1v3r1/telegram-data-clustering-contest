      <p>PONTIAN, Nov 8 ― DAP adviser Lim Kit Siang said today that a viral video of Perak Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu will not affect Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) Tanjung Piai by-election campaign if the machinery is focused on the polls.</p>
      <p>Lim said there have been attempts to cause disintegration among PH but this will not benefit anyone.</p>
      <p>“The MB (Ahmad Faizal) has said it was taken out of context; I don't know what actually transpired, but we take it as his word and if there is anything to pursue, it will be after the by-election. At present, the focus should be on this by-election,” he told reporters when met after the Budget 2020 Forum in Kukup here.</p>
      <p>Also present were DAP national assistant publicity secretary Yeo Bee Yin and Johor DAP chairman Liew Chin Tong.</p>
      <p> Lim, who is also Iskandar Puteri MP, said the party will only discuss the viral video after the by-election as DAP wants to focus on winning the seat for PH.</p>
      <p>“We need a single-minded focus on this issue (by-election) and the rest have to wait,” said the veteran politician.            </p>
      <p>Earlier today, a video clip was posted on a Facebook page showing Ahmad Faizal discussing with a group of people how he has to face DAP over certain issues, including Malay land.            </p>
      <p>The 2.47-minute video clip was said to have been taken during the Tanjung Piai by-election campaign as Pakatan Harapan's candidate Karmaine Sardini was also seen in the footage. ― Bernama</p>
