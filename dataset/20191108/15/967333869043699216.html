        <b>TOKYO (Sputnik) - Departures and arrivals at Kansai International Airport near the city of Osaka, in western Japan, were suspended twice due to drone-like object sightings overnight, Japan's NHK broadcaster reported on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Japan's NHK broadcaster, the possible drone intrusion was reported by the pilot of a plane approaching the airport on Thursday. Both runways were promptly closed to ensure safety, and an hour later the airport resumed work.</p>
      <p>However, shortly after the situation calmed down, a security guard again reported seeing a possible drone. The incident triggered another closure of the runway. No drone was discovered, and the airport went back into operation after midnight local time.</p>
      <p>Due to the disruption, a total of 27 flights were either cancelled or rerouted.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time that Kansai International Airport <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201711091058964439-drone-spins-out-of-control-japan/">personnel have spotted a drone-like object</a> in the vicinity of the facility. On 19 October, the airport was also shut down after the airport staff noticed a drone-like object.</p>
      <p>The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism called upon the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201811021069437237-japan-airlines-london-uk-heathrow-airport-alcohol/">airport’s crew to take urgent measures</a> to prevent such situations. Kansai’s management is considering the possibility of purchasing a censor system to identify drones around the airport.</p>
