      <p>A young Cambuslang footballer is in the running for a goal of the season award - against adult players.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/budding-cambuslang-footballer-earns-first-20723429">Sophia Martin</a> , 12, has been nominated for the prize at the MG ALBA SWF Annual Awards, which celebrates the best in Scottish women’s football.</p>
      <p>The budding striker is in the running for the award, sponsored by our sister paper <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">the Daily Record</a> , thanks to a strike for her club side Hamilton against Central Girls FC.</p>
      <p>Sophia’s goal saw her use a quick touch to flick the ball past one opponent before sprinting away.</p>
      <p>She then dribbled past another defender, moved into the penalty area and slid the ball past the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>This is the second year the awards are being held, and organisers hope they will become an annual tradition.</p>
      <p>To vote for Sophia’s goal, visit <a href="https://scotwomensfootball.com/swf-annual-awards/nominations">https://scotwomensfootball.com/swf-annual-awards/nominations</a> .</p>
      <p>The winner will be announced at Glasgow’s Mariott Hotel on November 30.</p>
