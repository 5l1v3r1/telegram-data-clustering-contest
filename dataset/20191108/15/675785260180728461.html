      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:02:16+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/michael-schumacher-ski-accident-10360005">Michael Schumacher's</a> wife, Corinna has paid tribute to her husband in a rare interview, declaring: "I don't forget who I have to thank."</p>
      <p>Formula 1 legend Schumacher suffered a serious brain injury in December 2013 in a skiing accident in the French Alps, which left him in a coma.</p>
      <p>Since then, little has been revealed about the condition of the seven-time world champion since he moved to being treated at home in September 2014.</p>
      <p>Schumacher's son, Mick, now 20, is following in his father's footsteps with a racing career of his own.</p>
      <p>But Corinna, 50, and daughter Gina Maria, 22, have another passion: horseback riding.</p>

      <p>And in an interview with <i>She</i> Magazine in Germany, she paid tribute to Michael and credited him for the love that both have for horses.</p>
      <p>The family have a ranch in the Swiss town of Givrins which was given to his wife by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/michael-schumacher-ski-accident-10360005">Michael Schumacher</a> in 2005 for their 10th wedding anniversary, and mother and daughter are also organising riding events there.</p>
      <p>"When I was 30, I very much wanted to have a horse and Michael went with me to Dubai, where I intended to buy an Arabian horse," she said.</p>
      <p>"He did everything for me. I will never forget who I have to thank. That would be my husband Michael."</p>

      <p>Corinna, who married Michael in 1995, now has two ranches in Switzerland and Texas.</p>
      <p>She currently has 40 horses, and Michael used to boast about how he would act as the hired help, known as a Turniertrottel in Germany, where he would much out stables and drive the truck.</p>
      <p>She added: "I am glad that I have such a great team that keeps everything going. I feel the greatest pride when I see Gina.</p>
      <p>"What she has already achieved and how much fun she is - that makes me happy."</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Gina helped Germany secure a gold medal in the SVAG FEI Reining European Championship in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>And she revealed the advice her father once gave her, stating: "When you drive a car, you can stick it in the garage afterwards. But a horse needs to be looked after all the time, even on Sundays."</p>
      <p>According to Corinna, their daughter's success was something Michael had once prophesied.</p>
      <p>She said: "When my husband told me that one day Gina would be much better than me, I was not thrilled.</p>
      <p>"I thought 'hey, how did he come to that conclusion?' I mean I work with horses from morning to night, trying to learn everything."</p>
      <p>"He then told me: 'You are too nice. Gina however gives everything to the horses, but she is also able to say no and to see it through.'"</p>
