      <p>The country's foreign exchange reserves rose by $3.515 billion to touch a fresh lifetime high of $446.098 billion in the week to November 1, helped by increase in foreign currency assets, RBI data showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>In the previous week, the reserves had increased by $1.832 billion to $442.583 billion.</p>
      <p>The increase in reserves in the reporting week was mainly on account of a jump in foreign currency assets (FCA), a major component of the overall reserves.</p>
      <p>FCA increased by $3.201 billion to $413.654 billion in the week ended November 1, the RBI said.</p>
      <p>Expressed in US dollar terms, the foreign currency assets include the effect of appreciation or depreciation of non-US units like the euro, pound and the yen held in the foreign exchange reserves.</p>
      <p>During the week, gold reserves increased by $301 million to $27.353 billion.</p>
