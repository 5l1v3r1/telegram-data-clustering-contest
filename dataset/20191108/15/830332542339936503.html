      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A Wisconsin National Guard sergeant says he's being discharged in retaliation for complaining about sexual misconduct in his unit.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin Air National Guard Master Sgt. Jay Ellis' complaint last year has triggered two federal investigations. Ellis has alleged that Guard officials have launched a review of his medical history to set up a medical discharge and deny him retirement benefits in retaliation.</p>
      <p>The Wisconsin Guard's top commander, Maj. Gen. Donald Dunbar, has ordered an investigation into Ellis' reprisal allegations.</p>
      <p>Ellis says a representative from a Scott Air Force Base medical evaluation board has informed him that he will receive a medical discharge. He says he plans to appeal the decision. He says if his appeals fail he'll be discharged in February.</p>
      <p>Guard spokesman Joe Trovato didn't immediately respond to a message.</p>
