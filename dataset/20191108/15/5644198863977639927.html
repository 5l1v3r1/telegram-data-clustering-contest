      <p>SINGAPORE: A man blocked a parking lot for the handicapped with his vehicle and later slammed his elbow onto the bonnet of a car that was entitled to park there.</p>
      <p>For one count of mischief causing damage of at least S$500, Benny Pang Hui Heng was fined S$1,500 on Friday (Nov 8).</p>

      <p>The 50-year-old man was also ordered to pay the victim S$500 in compensation.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Pang had gone to a multi-storey car park near Pasir Ris Drive 10 at about 9am on May 24 this year to get his van.</p>
      <p>He then drove to a loading and unloading bay to wait for his family members and parked his van in front of a parking lot reserved for the handicapped.</p>
      <p>A few minutes later, the 27-year-old victim, who was driving a BMW fitted with a handicapped decal, arrived and wanted to park in the reserved lot.</p>
      <p>He sounded his horn several times as Pang's van was obstructing his way, but Pang did not move his van.</p>
      <p>He did so only when the victim gestured at the handicapped decal on the car.</p>
      <p>The victim parked in the reserved lot and alighted to confront Pang, who ignored him.</p>
      <p>The victim then left the location, leaving his friend in his car. At this point, Pang's son confronted the victim's friend.</p>
      <p>When the victim returned, he also began arguing with Pang's son.</p>
      <p>The victim tried to drive off, but Pang stood in front of his car and obstructed his path.</p>
      <p>When the victim inched the car forward in an attempt to leave, Pang leapt forward and intentionally slammed his elbow onto the bonnet of the BMW, causing S$500 in damage, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh.</p>
      <p>For committing mischief that caused damage of S$500 and above, Pang could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, or both.</p>
