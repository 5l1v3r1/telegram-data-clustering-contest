      <p>An ancient “barbarian” woman almost 2,000 years old has been found bedecked in fine jewellery from the Roman Empire</p>
      <p>The high-status female in the Caucasus is seen as a wife or other close relative of a prominent warrior or chieftain.</p>
      <p>Her remains, found in a tomb in the mountainous Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, have surprised archeologists.</p>
      <p>“She had two rings on her fingers manufactured with the use of quite a complex technology,” said archaeologist Anna Kadieva, head of an expedition at Zayukovo-2 burial site.</p>
      <p>"Each of them is cast from transparent white glass with golden fibres from the same material, with a dark glass installation in the middle.</p>

      <p>“Beyond any doubt, it is Roman-made.</p>
      <p>“It is quite expensive for the time, and priceless for the barbarian world because there was no glass production in North Caucasus back then.</p>
      <p>“The beads on her shoes were made of glass and carnelian.”</p>
      <p>She went to the afterlife wearing a bright violet amethyst medallion.</p>

      <p>“This is a high class gem worthy of its gold casing,” said the archaeologist from the State Historical Museum of Russia.</p>
      <p>The ancient woman is probably from the Alans warrior people who made incursions into the Caucasus in the first and second centuries AD.</p>
      <p>“We came to conclusion that wealthy warriors from North Caucasus presented expensive jewellery to their loved ones.</p>
      <p>“The woman most likely was a close relative of the warriors -- mother, wife, or sister -- because the catacomb is a family burial.”</p>
      <p>She was interred alongside a warrior and two other males.</p>
      <p>“It is not clear how they died, but given the integrity of the skeletons, the time between their deaths was short,” she said.</p>

      <p>“Gold is always a sign of high social status.</p>
      <p>“It is possible to say that the woman could be the wife of a renowned warrior or tribal chief.”</p>
      <p>Further studies are being made into the finds.</p>
