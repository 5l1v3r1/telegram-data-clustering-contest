      <p>A cute baby goat was filmed trying to climb up a slanting plank that appears to be extremely slippery. As soon as the goat kid reaches the top of the plank, it begins sliding back, confused about what is going on.</p>
      <p>However, its luckier siblings are seen conquering the plank. Inspired by their accomplishment, the little goat attempts a second climb, but alas fails again.</p>
      <p>Hopefully it will get there eventually.</p>
