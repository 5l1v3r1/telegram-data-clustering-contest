      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:12:02+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/ADSoomeet</a></address>
      <p>Sprint has <a href="https://newsroom.sprint.com/new-sprint-perks-unlocks-875-in-value-for-customers-on-its-top-tier-unlimited-plan.htm?utm_source=automated&amp;utm_medium=newsroom_email">announced</a> a new discount program specially designed for "hard-working Americans". Called Sprint Perks, the program offers the carrier's top-tier Unlimited Premium plan at the price of its mid-tier Unlimited Plus plan to select customers. According to <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/10/colorado-mississippi-t-mobile-sprint-lawsuit.html">Sprint</a>, the program offers an additional value of $875 each year at no extra cost.</p>
      <p>Over 130 million Americans including employees across multiple industries, small business owners, educators, first responders, and members of the military, including veterans, active duty, and reserves of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible for this program. Eligible customers can sign-up for Sprint Perks starting today, November 8.</p>
      <p>"We're committed to providing hard-working Americans more savings and value by offering our top-tier unlimited plan for the price of our mid-tier plan," said Dow Draper, Sprint chief commercial officer. "Sprint Perks gives qualifying new and existing customers the meaningful services they use every day."</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Sprint also promises 100% Total Satisfaction Guarantee with this program. The carrier lets new customers try out its network and see if the savings are as advertised. If they are not satisfied and wish to switch to other <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/carriers">networks</a>, Sprint will return their money. "We're confident this will make for a great customer experience. Guaranteed or your money back," Dow added.</p>
      <h3>Sprint Unlimited Premium</h3>
      <p>Sprint's Unlimited Premium plan usually costs $80 per month, while Unlimited Plus is priced at $70 per month. However, with the Sprint Perks program, a select set of customers can now avail the benefits of the former at the price of the latter.</p>
      <p>Unlimited Premium benefits include free Amazon Prime membership, subscription to an ad-supported Hulu plan, subscription to Tidal High-Fidelity music streaming service, 100GB of mobile hotspot data, full HD video streaming, and unlimited roaming in Canada and Mexico. In addition, small business owners also get international calling, mobile security, and business priority support.</p>

      <p>Military personnel, meanwhile, can further avail a 50-percent discount off Unlimited Premium rates on up to six additional lines. Sprint also offers flexible plans that give active duty ability to pause and activate service while deployed.</p>
      <p>On top of this, anyone who has served in the U.S. military (active, veteran or reserves) can enter a lucky draw to win a free tablet with a year of service included from Sprint. All they need to do is visit a Sprint store before November 14 and register their interest. No purchase is necessary. Sprint will select 100 lucky winners nationwide.</p>
