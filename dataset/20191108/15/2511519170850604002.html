      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/seinfeld"><i>Seinfeld</i></a> actor Charles Levin’s body was found “partially consumed by vultures” after he died from a fall down a 30 foot ravine.</p>
      <p>Levin was found dead on 13 July near a remote road after his son Jesse reported him missing on 28 June.</p>
      <p>According to reports from the Grants Pass Department of Public Safety, his naked body was found wedged between two trees after his fatal fall.</p>
      <p>The reports, which have been obtained by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7657613/Seinfeld-actor-Charles-Levins-body-30ft-slope-partially-eaten-vultures.html?ico=pushly-notifcation-small"><i>Daily Mail</i></a>, also state there was evidence of “animal scavenging likely in the form of turkey vultures”.</p>
      <p>It is thought that Levin, who was 70, lost his way while driving through a backroad. His dog was found deceased in his car, which was discovered at the top of the slope.</p>
      <p>His death was recorded as an accident.</p>
      <p>Levin appeared in a 1993 episode of US sitcom <i>Seinfeld</i>. His character, a mohel who performs circumcisions under Jewish law, memorably cuts the lead character’s finger.</p>
      <p>His other credits include <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a> films <i>Annie Hall</i> and <i>Manhattan</i>. He also appeared as a guest star in TV shows including <i>The Twilight Zone</i> and <i>Night Court</i>.</p>
