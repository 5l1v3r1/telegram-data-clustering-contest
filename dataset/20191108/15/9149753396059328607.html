      <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 mods are probably okay, as long as you stay offline</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:59:40+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/ian-boudreau/" target="_blank">Ian Boudreau</a></address>
      <p>It was only a matter of time before mods starting showing up for Red Dead Redemption 2, and they're already turning the game's western landscape into a weirder and wilder place. But if you've <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-trainer/">experimented with mods</a> at all, you'll have seen a rather severe warning in the Rockstar Launcher that says playing the game with altered game files can result in your being banned from Red Dead Online.</p>
      <p>"Use of unofficial modifications to the game is not supported and may result in being banned from online content," the warning reads.</p>
      <p>The good news is that you're okay to use single-player mods in Red Dead Redemption 2, at least provisionally. Rockstar Games confirms to us that its standing policy regarding mods applies to Red Dead as well.</p>
      <p>"Take-Two has agreed that it generally will not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of third parties," an explanatory post on <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/115009494848/PC-Single-Player-Mods">Rockstar's support site</a> reads.</p>
      <p>So, as long as mods don't touch the online component of the game, aren't used as a way to make money, and don't improperly use the unlicensed works of other rights holders, you ought to be good to go. However, "Take-Two reserves the right to object to any third-party project, or to revise, revoke, and/or withdraw this statement at any time at their own discretion."</p>
      <p>For now though, if you just want to cruise around the map as an eagle, or as Arthur Boargan (pictured above) you should be okay.</p>
