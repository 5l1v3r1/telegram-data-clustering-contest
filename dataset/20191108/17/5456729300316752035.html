      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:49:31+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/361598-fire-engulfs-buildings-in-lagos-community.html" target="_blank">Ifeoluwa Adediran</a></address>
      <p>The Lagos States Emergency Agency (LASEMA) has confirmed another incident of fire outbreak in Lagos. The fire outbreak occurred at Kano street, Ebute Metta Lagos.</p>
      <p>Firefighters were said to have arrived at the scene to quench the fire.</p>
      <p>According to a statement by Nosa Okunbor, the spokesperson of LASEMA, several shanties in the area have been gutted by fire. The cause could not be ascertained.</p>
      <p>“The intensity of the fire has spread to the adjoining buildings. No loss of life nor injury sustained but properties worth fortune had been destroyed,” Mr Okunbor said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mr Okunbor added that the Lagos State fire service, police and other first responders are at the scene of the incident working together to curtail the spread of the fire.</p>
      <p>However, the fire truck later ran out of water.</p>
      <p>This led to a frustrated crowd attacking the firefighters at about 3:24 p.m. The crowd also warned officials not to take photos. They said they lost properties worth millions to the fire outbreak.</p>
      <p>The angry mob have also have hampered the recovery process with their irate attitude and constituted a source of security threat to all government officials and responders at the incident scene, Mr Okunbor said.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the recovery process is still ongoing. LASEMA team and other responders still at the incident site, he said.</p>
