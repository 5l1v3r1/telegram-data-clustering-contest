      <p>There's no crying in baseball, but this news might bring on some happy tears. <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/darcy-carden-star-a-league-own-series-at-amazon-1253276?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">The Hollywood Reporter</a> </i>announced yesterday that <i>A League of Their Own </i>is in the works as a TV series for Amazon, with <i>The Good Place</i>'s D'Arcy Carden and <i>Broad City</i>'s Abbi Jacobson in talks to star. Below, everything we know about who's playing ball and when.</p>
      <h3>What is the A League of Their Own TV series about?</h3>
      <p>The series is based on the classic 1992 film directed by the late Penny Marshall. Starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell, and Madonna, the movie grossed more than $100 million at the box office. That made Marshall the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/12/18/18146811/penny-marshall-dead-director-league-of-their-own-big-awakenings">first woman</a> to ever direct two $100-million-plus-grossing films after 1988's <i>Big</i>.</p>
      <p>The original film followed sisters Dottie (Davis) and Kit (Petty) as they joined the All-American Girls' Baseball League and played for the Rockford Peaches, hitting World Series-level heights. It's unclear what timeline the Amazon series will take place in. Per <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/darcy-carden-star-a-league-own-series-at-amazon-1253276?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">THR</a></i>, it will not follow the sisters, instead taking "a modern look at the league." <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/darcy-carden-in-negotiations-star-i-a-league-of-their-own-amazon-gbemisola-ikumelo-1202780792/">Deadline</a> reports that the series will center around the league during World War II, which aligns with the original film's time period. An official description reads:</p>
      <blockquote>"<i>A League of Their Own</i> is a half-hour comedy infusing the warmth, humor and DNA of the classic film, while taking a contemporary spin on the stories of the women surrounding the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The show will begin with the formation of the league in 1943 and follows the Rockford Peaches season to season as they struggle to keep the team alive through close games, injuries, late night bar crawls, sexual awakenings, <i>not crying</i> and road trips across a rapidly changing United States. The series dives deeper into the issues facing the country while following a ragtag team of women figuring themselves out while fighting to realize their dreams of playing professional baseball."</blockquote>
      <h3>Who is involved with the show?</h3>
      <p><i>THR </i>reports that Carden is in talks to star in the pilot, making it her first major follow-up to the Emmy-nominated series. Carden will reportedly star opposite Jacobson, who will also write and executive produce the project. <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/darcy-carden-in-negotiations-star-i-a-league-of-their-own-amazon-gbemisola-ikumelo-1202780792/">Deadline</a> reports that Gbemisola Ikumelo (<i>Famalam</i>) will join the cast as a character named Clance. Per the outlet, Jacobson will play farm girl Carson who, while her husband is away at war, tries out for the league. Carden will play Greta, "a beautiful and worldly player who once was in the Army."</p>
      <p>Will Graham (<i>Mozart in the Jungle</i>) is also on board to write and executive produce, along with Hailey Wierengo as executive producer.</p>

      <h3>When will it come out?</h3>
      <p>While there's no official release date for this iteration of the series, it won't be the first attempt to adapt the sports movie for the small screen. In 1993, CBS aired just three episodes of a sitcom based on the film. Sources also told <i>THR </i>that prior to Marshall's death in 2018, she and Davis each voiced support for the show.</p>
