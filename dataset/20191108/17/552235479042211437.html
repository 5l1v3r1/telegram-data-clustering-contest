      <h2>Celtic have partnered with their sponsors to highlight a great cause close to the club's heart.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:23:37+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Celtic have announced their famous Hoops will be adorned by the sponsorship of their Foundation's Christmas Appeal for Saturday's match with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a>.</p>
      <p>The club praised the "incredible support and generosity" of sponsors Dafabet and Magners in allowing the move to help promote a great cause.</p>
      <p>The unique shirts will feature the Christmas Appeal logo on the front and side before a selection are signed and auctioned for charity via the club's eBay account. All proceeds from the sale will then go to the charity.</p>
      <p>As well as the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> worn match shirts, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> 's men's warm-up gear will also be similarly branded.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Celtic describe the charity as a away to honour the philanthropy that marked the club's inception.</p>
      <p>Their <a href="http://www.celticfc.net/news/17074">website</a> stated: "Through our Christmas Appeal, we aim to honour the founding principles set out when the club was formed in 1887, by continuing to help those in our community, who are most in need.</p>

      <p>Celtic FC Foundation Chief Executive Tony Hamilton was delighted with the support provided by the clubs sponsors in allowing them to honour their traditions.</p>
      <p>He said: “We would like to offer our great thanks to club sponsors Dafabet and Magners, for this wonderful gesture.</p>
      <p>“Both organisations are always hugely supportive of our aims and objectives and allowing us to feature our logo on the shirts this Sunday, not only offers a tremendous opportunity to promote our 2019 Christmas Appeal but also to raise some invaluable funds.”</p>
