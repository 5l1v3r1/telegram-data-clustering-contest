      <h1>Crash leaves 40,000 pounds of tortillas scattered on highway</h1>

      <p>FOSTER TOWNSHIP, PA (<a href="https://wnep.com/2019/11/06/crash-involving-tractor-trailers-car-leaves-packaged-tortillas-all-over-route-901/">WNEP</a>) -- Thousands of tortillas littered a road after a crash involving two tractor trailers and a car in Schuylkill County, Pa.</p>
      <p>Busy Route 901 was shut down for hours outside Minersville after a crash that left police say 40,000 pounds flour tortilla scattered all over the roadway.</p>
      <p>As traffic was detoured around the crash site, crews worked to get the vehicles and the mess out of the way while police investigated what happened.</p>
      <p>Dan Fritz got caught in the backlog coming home from work.</p>
      <p>“The traffic back up was real bad because of the wreck, there's always wrecks because trucks come down there too fast,” said Fritz.</p>
      <p>Foster Township police say speed was a factor in this wreck.</p>
      <p>They say the truck hauling the tortillas was coming eastbound on Route 901 around noon on Wednesday when it took this curve too fast and its trailer began to wobble.</p>
      <p>It slid into another tractor-trailer coming westbound, hitting its cabin, temporarily pinning the driver and his passenger inside.</p>
      <p>The first truck continued on, hitting a car behind the second truck.</p>
      <p>The force of the impact caused the first truck to topple over.</p>
      <p>People living near Route 901 say speeding trucks are a problem.</p>
      <p>“Tractor-trailers are a big issue in the township, going too fast,” said Joe Zula.</p>
      <p>“The issue is over at that turn because the trucks come down there too fast and these guys don`t know how to drive,” said Fritz. “So, that's what happens and then everybody else is affected in this area.”</p>
      <p>There's even a sign posted warning tractor-trailer drivers they may topple overtaking this curve.</p>
      <p>Residents say they want drivers to slow down but don't know how to make them do it.</p>
      <p>“This town has cop but I don't any kind of surveillance out there to slow them down,” said Larry Gelch.</p>
      <p>“That I don't know, the speed limits are up but I don't know how you control it, don't know,” said Zula.</p>
      <p>Route 901 reopened around 5 p.m. on Wednesday and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
      <p>The driver and passenger in the second truck, as well as the driver of the car, were taken to the hospital for minor injuries.</p>
      <p>The driver of the truck that toppled over remained at the crash.</p>
