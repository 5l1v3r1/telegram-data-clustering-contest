      <h1>Where Liverpool vs Man City will be won and lost ahead of Anfield clash</h1>
      <h2>The two sides meet at Anfield on Sunday in the hotly-anticipated title clash. Liverpool can open a nine-point lead over their rivals with a win but City will be looking to gain ground</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Minto, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/scott-minto/</a></address>
      <p>Those who say it’s <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool’s</a> title if they beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday, are either forgetting how long (and tough) a Premier League season is, haven’t looked at their fixture list, or are looking for the headline.</p>
      <p>Even if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp’s</a> side get the victory, two things are certain - 1. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> <br/>will drop points (not necessarily through losing), and 2. City will go on a long <br/>winning run at some point, like last season.</p>
      <p>And if one of Klopp’s front three gets a serious injury, then there’s trouble!</p>
      <p>But there’s no doubt, a win for Liverpool would be massive psychologically. I also think they have a real belief this is their season and a real knack of winning games even if not playing at their best.</p>

      <p>Ruud Guillit used to say to us at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> that he just wanted each player to do two things to affect the game. The Liverpool players are certainly doing that right now.</p>
      <p>The key to victory Sunday is for the hosts to play on the front foot like they usually do at Anfield.</p>
      <p>City are vulnerable defensively, more than ever if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-ederson-out-liverpool-vs-20841377">Ederson doesn’t make it</a> .</p>
      <p>Claudio Bravo hasn’t taken to English football. His timing is clearly out too, rushing out midweek and getting sent off shows that.</p>

      <p>Then there’s the issue of who plays centre back. If it’s Fernandinho, they miss a lot of protection in midfield. If it’s Otamendi, then there is a mistake in him and he’s not as mobile as others.</p>
      <p>So Liverpool must play on that. Not by knocking long aimless balls over the top. But by keeping the ball then playing a first time pass in behind, just like Chelsea’s Jorginho did last week and De Bruyne does regularly for City.</p>
      <p>City need to score at least two to win. They are capable of it though.</p>
      <p>But worringly, Sergio Aguero hasn’t scored, or won, in 10 appearances at Anfield and Raheem Sterling, while being one of the best players in the world right now, needs to get over, what I believe, is a mental block of going back to Anfield.</p>

      <p>He hasn’t scored there yet as a visiting player. And City haven’t won there in their last 18 attempts.</p>
      <p>I did say before a ball was kicked, that I thought Liverpool would win the title this season.</p>
      <p>While Sunday doesn’t decide it, I do think they will win the game, and take a major step towards achieving their goal.</p>
