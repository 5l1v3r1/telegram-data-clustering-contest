      <h2>Guardiola aimed a dig at the Liverpool striker for 'diving' in an attempt to win a penalty against Aston Villa last week, with the pair now set to face-off on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:23:10+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fletcher</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Carragher has said that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> is angry at Liverpool for scoring late goals and that his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/sadio-mane-hits-back-pep-20827907">comments about Sadio Mane ‘diving’</a> are just pure frustration from the City boss.</p>
      <p>The European champions take on the Premier League winners at Anfield this weekend, and a victory for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> would see his side go nine points clear at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Despite the match happening in November, it’s already being deemed as a must-win fixture for Guardiola, whose side’s wretched Anfield record dates back to 2003.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jamie-carragher">Carragher</a> was part of the Reds’ defence the last time City beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on their own turf, and the former England centre-back has had his say on the Mane-Guardiola saga.</p>

      <p>"Having heard Mane had scored the last-minute winner last Saturday - and been booked for diving in the game at Aston Villa - Guardiola betrayed his emotions in the TV interview following his own team’s late win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>
      <p>"For a brief moment coming off the pitch last week he must have thought the gap was down to four or even three points, only to recognise it could be nine by Sunday night.”</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/08/liverpool-manchester-city-cant-stand-mutual-loathing-last/">the Telegraph</a> , Carragher went on say that he could see why Liverpool’s late goalscoring record would enrage the ex-Barca and Bayern manager.</p>

      <p>"Why wouldn’t that infuriate you? It is nothing to do with ‘mind games’.</p>
      <p>"Guardiola sounded more like a fan who could not hide how fed up he was that his direct rival had won in the last minute again."</p>
      <p>City have also been hit with an injury to no.1 goalkeeper Ederson, who has been ruled out of Sunday's crunch clash.</p>

      <p>Deputy Claudio Bravo was called into action after the Brazilian limped out of the Champions League tie with Atalanta midweek, but he was sent off before the game could finish.</p>
      <p>However despite Bravo not having played a Premier League match in 18 months, Guardiola has backed him to provide adequate cover.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen him in training and I know how fired up and how good he is – we're not going to lose because of Claudio," Guardiola said.</p>
      <p>“You have to respect this guy. He’s played at an incredible level, he won the Copa America, other cups, respect that guy, he's an incredible, top, top keeper.</p>
      <p>“So why should I not have any confidence with one player in my team? He wouldn’t be here.”</p>
