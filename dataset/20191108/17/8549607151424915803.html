      <h3>Stablecoin Pilot on Zilliqa</h3>
      <p>Smart-contract platform Zilliqa is primed to host a stablecoin initiative on its blockchain as Xfers, a Singaporean fintech venture that looks to leverage emerging technologies to streamline the digital payments industry, announced plans to launch its own Singapore dollar-pegged stablecoin XSGD.</p>
      <p>A Y Combinator alum, Xfers believes that stablecoins can help increase the transparency, efficiency, and ease of use of digital currencies among the mainstream audience. The startup views stablecoins as a safe digital route to access financial products, the report reads. In order to launch a stablecoin pilot, Xfers is considering leveraging Zilliqa’s native scripting language Scilla to enable smart contract functionalities.</p>
      <p>Per sources close to the matter, the proposed stablecoin project is scheduled to go live in December 2019.</p>
      <p>Xfers CEO and co-founder, Tianwei Liu, commented on the development, saying:</p>
      <p>“<b>StraitsX demonstrates our willingness to adopt technology to propel our vision of building an open banking infrastructure for the region.</b>”</p>
      <p>Adding:</p>
      <blockquote>“<b>With the transparency that blockchain provides, as well as the stablecoins being price-pegged to local fiat currencies, StraitsX aims to be the common ledger for digital assets, payments, fund transfers, and ecommerce.</b>”</blockquote>
