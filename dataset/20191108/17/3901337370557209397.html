        <i>“It is understandable to side step the issue. With another encounter on the cards, there is no need to dwell on the matter but we saw it and Billiat knows it was unnecessary and uncalled for. Lorch complained of Billiat simulation and took his frustration out on him.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>SL Supporter @Quaddy1994 has given his opinion on the seemingly deliberate stamp on Khama Billiat by Thembinkosi Lorch in last week’s derby.</p>
      <p>While the Zimbabwean clarified the situation with a rather diplomatic response, SL Supporter @mothogaafele feels that although Lorch’s actions were not deliberate, it could have inflicted damage on the Amakhosi star.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“It was not deliberate, however he stepped on your Achilles knowing that it may take you out of the game to minimize the threat you were posing - we know these ugly tactics. We were not born yesterday - Mr Billiat is trying to be diplomatic here, saying its fine even if there is a problem on hand...”</i>

      <p><i> </i>SL Supprter @LikeitorNot feels that there was an ulterior motive for ‘Nyoso’s’ actions.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Lorch thought he wouldn’t get a yellow card for his challenge on Khama, and he deliberately stepped on him to get his 4th booking, so he could be available on Saturday.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>With the two sides squaring off for the second time in seven days SL Supporter @ Ofentse Kakapa Mahatlhe feels that Billiat can settle the score on the field of play.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“This coming Saturday, you must sort him out, on the field of play! Am I clear?”</i>

        <b>Do you think Lorch’s step on Billiat was a deliberate one?</b>
