      <h1>Apple Orders a Workplace Thriller From Smirk-Faced Stiller. It’s Also Got Adam Scott.</h1>

      <p><i>Ah, poetry! </i>That’s probably what you thought when you read this terrible rhyming headline, and it’s also what we thought when we read the press release for the new Apple TV+ series <i>Severance</i>,<i> </i>executive produced and directed by Ben Stiller. Stiller won the 2019 DGA Award for Best TV Movie/Limited Series for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/ben-stiller-escape-at-dannemora-prison-break.html"><i>Escape at Dannemora</i></a>,<i> </i>which received wide critical acclaim, even though its real-life subject <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/escape-at-dannemora-subject-hates-idiot-ben-stillers-show.html">seemed to disagree</a>. When Adam Scott isn’t busy hosting an <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/parks-and-recreations-adam-scott-host-abc-game-show-dont.html">ABC game show</a> or appearing at this year’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/who-will-be-at-vulture-festival-la-2019.html">Vulture Festival</a>, he will star in and produce this series.</p>
      <p>Apple describes <i>Severance </i>as “a workplace thriller that introduces Lumen Industries, a company that’s looking to take work-life balance to a new level. Scott will play the lead role of Mark, an employee with a dark past trying to put himself back together.” A drama about a man with a dark past? Hmm, ya don’t say. Hopefully the inherent satire of the premise resonates in a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2010/03/better_off_ted_victor_fresco.html"><i>Better Off Ted</i></a><i> </i>or <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/03/enlightened-amy-tragic-laura-dern.html"><i>Enlightened</i></a><i> </i>kind of way, which is welcome now more than ever. The series is written and created by Dan Erickson.</p>
      <p>There’s no word in this first release of when <i>Severance </i>will debut on the streaming service, but it does mention that it comes from the same studio as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/see-i-have-so-many-questions.html"><i>See</i></a>.<i> </i>Maybe it’s a prequel from the <i>See</i>-i-verse?</p>
