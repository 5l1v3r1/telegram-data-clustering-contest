      <p>She wrote: "Thank you @essexcosmetics for my @profhilo_uk treatment! It’s not Botox and it’s not a filler it’s so good for hydrating skin and other benefits which is a much better alternative."</p>
      <p>Profhilo is synthetic <a href="https://www.getthegloss.com/article/hyaluronic-acid-the-gold-standard-skin-gredient-for-hydration">hyaluronic acid</a> that is injected by a into the face and promises to boost natural collagen production to give users a dewy and plumped- up complexion.</p>

      <p>It comes after Lauren's fans begged her to cut back on fillers after she posted a airbrushed snap alongside a confident and seemingly boastful caption: "They fall in love before they know my name" onto social media.</p>
      <p>Eagle-eyed fans instantly fled to the comment section to blast the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebs-go-dating">Celebs Go Dating</a> hopeful's constantly increasing lip size.</p>
      <p>One social media user wrote: "Why all the silly fillers? Your pics aren’t real. You don’t need them!"</p>

      <p>While another one harshly questioned: "What have you done to your face?"</p>
      <p>A third commented: "It literally looks like a blow up doll filter."</p>
      <p>One person pointed out: "You've overdone it with the collagen."</p>

      <p>While another shared: "I wish u knew how beautiful you were without all the cosmetic procedures xx."</p>
      <p>Lauren previously claimed in June that she had not had fillers in two years.</p>
      <p>However, Lauren appeared to have changed her mind last month as she <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/lauren-goodger-vows-full-blown-20164756">expressed her desire to have "full-blown surgery"</a> .</p>
      <p>In the past, the star admitted to undergoing a nose job, boob job, liposuction to rid her of 'lumps and bumps' and fillers, shortly after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/lauren-goodger-photos-made-lose-7108817">rising to fame on The Only Way Is Essex in 2010.</a></p>
      <p>Lauren continued to surgically sculpt her image when she had a boob job to take her from a 34D cup to a 34E cup in 2014.</p>

      <p>In September, the former TOWIE icon confessed to <a href="https://closeronline.co.uk/">Closer magazine</a> that she still "hates" her body image and opened up about the pressure to look good all the time.</p>
      <p>She told the magazine: "I hate my body, I hate it. I want to get surgery.</p>
      <p>"I want full-blown surgery. I want it all sucked out and I want to be little. I want to be skinny."</p>
