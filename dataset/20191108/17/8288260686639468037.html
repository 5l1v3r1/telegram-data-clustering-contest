      <h1>'Too much' - Pundits all agree with this prediction for Wolves v Aston Villa</h1>
      <h2>Wolves vs Aston Villa | The two Midlands rivals meet at Molineux on Sunday looking for three points and the all-important bragging rights</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:48:08+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Only two points separate Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa, but the experts all expect to see the same result when the two meet on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> have the slight edge over Villa going into the game and are unbeaten in their last six in the league, but have registered three draws in a row.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> meanwhile have lost the last two, against title contenders Liverpool and Man City, with the defeat against Jurgen Klopp's men coming in heartbreaking fashion.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith's side came out on top when the two sides put out much-changed teams in the Carabao Cup, but a selection of pundits see Wolves earning the derby day spoils.</p>

      <p>Charlie Nicholas, in his Sky Sports column, believes Wolves' attacking unit will have 'too much' for Mings and Co., he said: "It is a very good Sunday and this is a great derby. Aston Villa are an open and expansive team. They played very well against Liverpool and should have got something from it.</p>
      <p>"They cannot see and adapt to closing the shop. A draw would have been a good result - Villa deserved something from it, but they always make mistakes.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I think the Wolves front two, especially when Diogo Jota gets going, will be too much. The movement and intelligence of Raul Jimenez makes him a great player, so I think they will edge it."</p>
      <p>Liverpool legend Mark Lawrenson also believes the hosts will have 'too much' and is backing a routine 2-0 win.</p>
      <p>In his BBC column, he wrote: "Aston Villa will be stung after letting another lead slip so late on against Liverpool and ending up with nothing. At some stage they will put in a good performance, and see it through to collect the points, but I am not sure it will happen at Molineux.</p>
      <p>"Wolves have played an awful lot of games because of their involvement in the Europa League from an early stage, but they have got a good squad and a big squad and they should have too much for a Villa side who are still learning about life at this level."</p>

      <h3>Will Villa secure a second win of the season over Wolves on Sunday?</h3>
      <h4>2000+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Absolutely - three points in the bag No - home win Draw all over</p>
      <p>Former Birmingham City manager Harry Redknapp meanwhile, thinks Wolves will find their goalscoring touch in a win over the Villans.</p>
      <p>"Wolves against Aston Villa is always a hotly contested and eagerly awaited midlands derby and Molineux will be packed to the rafters for this weekend’s clash," he said to BetVictor.</p>

      <p>"Both clubs are in the wrong half of the table with Wolves just two points better off than their rivals. Seven draws have hurt the Black and Golds and turning draws into wins is the main target for manager Nuno Espirito Santo.</p>
      <p>"Villa were gutted to see leaders Liverpool leave Villa Park last Saturday with all three points, after a winner deep into stoppage time, after seemingly doing enough to share the spoils. They will get a chance of revenge in the League Cup quarter-final but before then need top-flight points to keep afloat.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"They did beat Wolves 2-1 in the League Cup recently but have not shown the consistency away to make an impact so far. Wolves are finding goals their main issue as defensively they are pretty resolute but hopefully a big crowd can inspire them to finally convert chances and celebrate derby success."</p>
      <p>And finally, Michael Owen is backing Wolves to win a thriller in front of the Sky cameras: "Aston Villa beat a very young Wolves side in the League Cup at Villa Park last week, but Wolves can get their revenge at Molineux on Sunday in what should be another terrific Midlands derby.</p>
      <p>"Villa were the latest side to be undone by Liverpool’s never say die attitude last weekend, but they are making a good fist of their return to top-flight football. However, Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have scored in their last 10 league games and I fancy them to edge a thriller."</p>
