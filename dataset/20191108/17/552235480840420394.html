      <p>The principal of Dundee University has stood down amid an investigation into alleged non-payment of rent.</p>
      <p>Professor Andrew Atherton took up the £300,000 role on January 1 after moving from Lancaster University.</p>
      <p>He also received a £40,000 "disruption allowance" to help with the move.</p>
      <p>Prof Atherton was suspended on September 13 for alleged non-payment of rent on accommodation which the university provided to him, sparking an independent disciplinary investigation.</p>
      <p>The university has now announced Prof Atherton has decided to step down, meaning the investigation has been halted.</p>
      <p>A statement issued by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee">Dundee</a> University said: "In the short time that Professor Atherton has been with the university, he has shown a commitment to excellence.</p>
      <p>"His broad experience has brought fresh ideas, a focus on sustainability and a drive to further enhance the university's national and global standing.</p>
      <p>"However, it has become apparent that the university's vision for its future and the values it holds are different to the aspirations of Professor Atherton.</p>
      <p>"He has therefore decided to step down so that the university can continue to pursue its current strategy."</p>
      <p>The university executive group will continue to manage the organisation's affairs.</p>
      <p>Prof Atherton's remuneration package included a £254,000 salary and pension contributions.</p>
      <p>At Lancaster <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/universities-and-colleges">University</a> , which he joined in 2013, he was deputy vice-chancellor and professor of enterprise.</p>
      <p>Before that he was senior deputy vice-chancellor at Lincoln University, and he also previously worked at Durham University.</p>
