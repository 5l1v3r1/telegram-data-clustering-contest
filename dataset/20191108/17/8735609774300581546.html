      <p>MONTREAL -- Toronto Pearson Airport is not fulfilling its obligations to French-speaking passengers, the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages has found.</p>
      <p>The Commissioner said eight complaints it received between July 2017 and March 2018 about a lack of service in French are founded. In each case, airport staff were found to be unable to provide information or help to travellers at Pearson in French.</p>
      <p>In one case, a French-speaking passenger had asked for help after their declaration card got stuck in a machine at border control. The passenger asked questions in French but only received answers in English.</p>
      <p>In another case, a French-speaking passenger reported being confronted by a "visibly irritated" airport staffer who answered a French question "furiously in English."</p>
      <p>Pearson Airport defended itself against the complaints saying that the employees should be in a position to answer inquiries in either official language, and that they are reminded of that fact on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>But Official Languages commissioner Raymond Theberge found that the airport "failed in its obligation to provide services to travellers in both official languages, as required by law."</p>
      <p>Theberge has give the airport 18 months to provide basic French training to airport staff who deal with the public.</p>
