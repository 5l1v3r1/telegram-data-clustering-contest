      <p>Vehicles determined to be procured by and registered in the name of banned outfits are being confiscated in line with steps implement FATF recommendations, they added.</p>
      <p>In Punjab, over 30 vehicles registered with a welfare NGO affiliated with a banned group have been seized from various cities along with other assets, the province’s officials said. According to them, the vehicles were once operated as ambulances but were currently said to be out of order.</p>
      <p>While apprising home authorities about the confiscated vehicles, the district commissioners of these cities voiced suspicions that the vehicles could be smuggled. “They warned the home department that such vehicles could have been registered against bogus documents,” one official said.</p>
      <p>An interior ministry official said other provinces were carrying out similar verification measures in order to ensure Pakistan meets FATF recommendations and further decreases space for banned outfits to operate.</p>
