      <h1>Ander Herrera admits football sometimes not the most important thing at Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder says he prefers the approach to on-field success of new side PSG, which he feels was not always priority during his five-year spell at Old Trafford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:10:52+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Man Utd</a> midfielder <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ander-herrera">Ander Herrera</a> has hinted that football was not the club's primary concern during his time at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The Spanish midfielder spent five years with the Red Devils, but departed in the summer on a free transfer to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/psg">PSG</a> .</p>
      <p>Herrera won a handful of trophies during his time in Manchester, but he claims the performance on the pitch was not always the sole focus.</p>
      <p>When asked by <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/player-says-football-not-important-man-united-happy-set-new-club/">So Foot</a> how life at his new club was panning out, Herrera said: "I cannot talk about what was happening in previous seasons because I was not there, but since I’m here, what I see is that I’m in a club that thinks only and exclusively about football.</p>

      <p>“And I say it sincerely, because sometimes, seen from the outside, PSG can have a glamorous side that can irritate some. But here, we sweat, we train, we work.</p>
      <p>“When I arrive at the training centre, the physios, podiatrist and physical trainer are already at work… Football, football, football… Leonardo is there every day.”</p>

      <p>But adding of his old club United, Herrera said: "I was very happy at that incredible club. I am very grateful to the supporters.</p>
      <p>"Frankly, I was immensely happy in Manchester, but at the club, there were times when I felt that football was not considered the most important thing.”</p>

      <p>United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has been criticised previously for placing higher importance on the club's commercial dealings over those related to team affairs.</p>
      <p>When prompted on what he meant by his statement, Herrera would not comment further, but added: "I do not want to compare, all I know is that here, I feel like I’m breathing football on all sides. And I like it."</p>
      <p>Woodward has hit out at any criticisms, insisting that despite the club's commercial success, footballer matters take precedence over off-field business.</p>
      <p>"If you look at the way the approach changed under the Glazers for commercial activity, that has brought in an extra £2.5-£3.5billion," Woodward said. "We have spent a lot of money on players."</p>
