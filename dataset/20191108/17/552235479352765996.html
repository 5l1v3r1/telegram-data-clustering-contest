      <h2>High-end British car maker Aston Martin has revealed details of the price and interior look of the much-awaited DBX SUV.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:37:26+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Donaldson</a></address>
      <p>ASTON Martin has announced that its new DBX - the first SUV from the maker of high-powered luxury cars - will cost £158,000 when it goes on sale later in November.</p>
      <p>That will put the V8 powered five-seater from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aston-martin">the British marque</a> in competition with rivals such as the £162,700 Bentley Bentayga W12 and new £125,949 Porsche Cayenne Coupe.</p>
      <p>The DBX is being built at a new plant in Wales and is powered by a Mercedes-Benz derived 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine producing 550 horsepower. The top speed is expected to be more than 180mph.</p>

      <p>Ahead of the full DBX launch, Aston Martin has released a picture of the production-ready interior, saying that great emphasis has been placed on giving driver and passengers the maximum amount of space.</p>
      <p>Among those testing design developments of the car were a group of children, who were invited to share their experience of getting into and out of the DBX in an ergonomic assessment model at the company’s design studio at Gaydon in Warwickshire.</p>
      <p>Aston Martin says more than six months were spent solely focussed on defining the position of the driver within the vehicle, with enough movement in the driver’s seat and steering column to allow clear visibility of all controls, screens and through windows.</p>
      <p>Crucially, the seating position also delivers a clear view of the bonnet to give confidence when in tight proximity to other cars, says the company.</p>
