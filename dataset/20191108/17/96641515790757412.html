      <p>Apple is continuing to expand its post-launch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-01-apple-tv-review.html">TV+ lineup</a> with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-11-masters-of-the-air-apple-tv-plus.html">high-profile shows</a>. The company has <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/adam-scott-star-thriller-ben-stiller-apple-tv-1253365">ordered</a> <i>Severance</i>, a workplace drama directed by Ben Stiller and created by <i>The Good Fight</i>'s Dan Erickson. The 10-episode first season will star Adam Scott (Ed Mackenzie in <i>Big Little Lies</i>) as an employee recovering from his "dark past." Scott will also produce, while <i>Outcast</i>'s Chris Black will executive produce alongside Erickson.</p>
      <p>It's not certain when the series will premiere, although work has been ongoing for months.</p>
      <p>The deal isn't a complete surprise. <i>Severance</i> is coming from Endeavor Content, the same production company that handles inaugural Apple TV+ show <i>See</i>. It's still a significant deal for Apple, and it shows that the tech firm is still focused on attracting big-name stars, whether they're in front of or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/10/apple-steven-spielberg-amazing-stories/">behind the camera</a>.</p>
