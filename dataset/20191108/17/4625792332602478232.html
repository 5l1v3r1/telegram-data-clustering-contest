      <h1>'We'll have to see': Trump undecided on Jeff Sessions support</h1>

      <p>President Trump said he might endorse Jeff Sessions for the Alabama Senate seat after the former attorney general left the administration over a tumultuous relationship with Trump.</p>
      <p>"He said very nice things about me last night. But, we'll have to see," the president told reporters Friday. "I haven't made a determination." When pressed again later about the Alabama race, Trump said there were lots of "very good candidates," and the competition will be "tough" for Sessions.</p>
      <p>Sessions confirmed Thursday that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeff-sessions-confirms-bid-for-us-senate-seat-in-alabama">he would be running</a> for his old Senate seat in Alabama, which is currently held by Sen. Doug Jones, who is a Democrat. "The president is doing a great job for America and Alabama, and he has my strong support," Sessions said.</p>
      <p>The Alabama Republican was one of the first major public officials to back Trump during his 2016. The president tapped him in 2017 to be his attorney general.</p>
      <p>The two had a falling out after <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/jeff-sessions-defends-his-decision-to-recuse-himself-from-russia-investigation-i-did-the-right-thing">Sessions recused himself</a> from the Russia investigation paving the way for special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump blamed the "witch hunt" on Sessions, and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeff-sessions-resigns-as-attorney-general">he resigned as attorney general</a> on Nov. 7, 2018.</p>
