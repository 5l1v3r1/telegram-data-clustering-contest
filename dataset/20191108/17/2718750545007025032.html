      <p>This week’s episode of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/stream-this-true-lies-the-matrix-literally-any-james-bond.html"><i>Stream This!</i></a><i> </i>has a whole new batch of highlights from the freshest cuts your local streaming service has to offer. This week Vulture’s staffers are joined by comedians Catherine Cohen, Pat Regan, Rachel Pegram, and Emmy Blotnick for a round of classic movie recommendations that might just convince you to stay in this weekend. (As if the 5 p.m. sunset isn’t quite reason enough.) This week we look back on:</p>
      <p>➽ The film that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/8-things-todays-movie-musicals-can-learn-from-grease.html">every sleepover attendee knows by heart</a><br/>➽ The movie so scary it has <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/the-15-best-urban-legend-horror-movies.html">ruined whole lives</a><br/>➽ The one with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/11/anne-rice-planning-a-vampire-chronicles-series.html">the best wigs of the early ’90s</a></p>
      <p>This is all objective so do not “at” us or whatever, okay? </p>
