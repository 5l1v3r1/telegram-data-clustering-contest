      <p>With December not far, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caffe-nero">Caffè Nero</a> has unveiled its new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> menu to get customers in the festive spirit.</p>
      <p>The coffee giant's latest selection is comprised of festive sandwiches, sweet bakery bites and even a Christmas salad, which are already in Caffè Nero stores nationwide.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the launch, Caffè Nero is also giving away 10,000 free coffees to customers who use its loyalty app over the festive season.</p>
      <p>From a 'pigs on blankets' toastie to vegan mince pies, the café chain's new holiday range is a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.</p>

      <p>Shoppers even have the chance to create their own festive latte or hot chocolate using a range of dairy and vegan-friendly milk, plus a choice of flavoured syrups and toppings. Prices vary depending on size and extras.</p>
      <p>Flavours include salted caramel drizzle, spiced ginger with cinnamon, hazelnut and chocolate chip and caramelised almond with golden crunch.</p>
      <p>Will Stratton-Morris, CEO at Caffe Nero UK, said: “We’re continuing to transform high street food by extending our new deli menu further and offering more choice for customers, with the launch of our fantastic new Christmas offering.</p>
      <p>"The fresh new products reflect the premium quality of our coffee and the vegan options mean more delicious options for all customers. We wanted to celebrate the launch by rewarding our loyal customers the best way we know how – more free coffees on us.”</p>
