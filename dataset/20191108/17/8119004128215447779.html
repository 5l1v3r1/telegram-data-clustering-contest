        <b>Wholesale onion prices will range between Tk 55 and Tk 90 per kilogram, according to a decision made by Shyambazar traders in Dhaka to rein in the market after over a month of turmoil.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The traders’ association held an emergency meeting on Thursday night and decided to sell the cooking ingredient at prices within the fixed ranges from Friday.</p>
      <p>The wholesale prices of onion imported from Egypt, China and Turkey is fixed between Tk 55 and Tk 60 a kg, of the Myanmar variety from Tk 80 to Tk 85, and local variety at Tk 90, according to the meeting decisions.</p>
      <p>The association’s Vice-President Haji Abdul Majed told bdnews24.com the wholesalers had been “defamed” and fined “even though it was quite natural for the market to destabilize due to a lack of supply”.</p>
      <p>“So we have been forced to fix the prices through discussions. It would have been better had we done it a month ago,” he added.</p>
      <p>The traders’ leader called for government steps to ensure similar moves at other wholesale markets in Dhaka, Chattogram and the rest of the country.</p>

      <p>The Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection conducted a mobile court drive on the Shyambazar market to check whether the businesses were following their own decision.</p>
      <p>Four of the traders were fined for violating the decision while the others were selling onion at the fixed prices, the directorate’s Assistant Director Abdul Jabbar Mandal said.</p>
