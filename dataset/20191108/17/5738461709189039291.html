      <p>Locals in Dundalk and the surrounding area are set to experience the magic of Christmas as the Frostival Winter Festival kicks-off on Friday November 22 and Saturday November 23 - marking the start of the festive season in Dundalk town centre. </p>
      <p>Starting at 7pm from the Longwalk Shopping Centre this year’s Frostival Parade route has been extended and will now weave its way from Church Street to Park Street on a magical journey illuminating the town centre as it goes.</p>
      <p>The procession will be a winter fairy tale come to life with the Nutcracker Prince spinning fire, a flying fairground horse, troupe of Dancing Christmas Stars, the Sugar plum fairy, giant snowflakes, huge golden baubles light up the street, Rudolph prances and dances, a Snowman cycles in a sparkling snowstorm and Santa is high above the crowd on his magic bicycle!</p>
      <p>With only a few weeks left until the festive fun begins, Dundalk BIDS say they are working hard finalising this years jam-packed two day festival programme.</p>
      <p>Santa will be in his magical grotto at Market Square from 4-7.30pm on Friday, and 12-3.30pm on Saturday, and little girls and boys are invited to visit completely free of charge to deliver their Christmas letters to him in person.</p>
      <p>The Little Elves Fun Zone will also be at Market Square and will run from 4-7.30pm on Friday and 12-3.30pm on Saturday with lots of fun for the little ones. They can even jump aboard the festive Frostival Express Train, also at Market Square, from 12-4pm on Saturday. </p>

      <p>“Accidents in the Workplace” will be headlining this year music programme and will be on stage from 6pm getting us all into the spirit of Christmas. </p>
      <p>Female sporting hero’s is the theme of this year’s Christmas lights switch-on and Pat O'Shaughnessy from LMFM will be the MC for the evening at the Frostival stage where he will be celebrating this year’s sporting achievements with stars from all walks of Louth’s female sports, including members of the triumphant Louth Ladies Team, international cycling star Eva Mc Crystal and international athletics star Patience Jumbo, unfortunately are very own Amy Broadhurst will be unavailable due her European fight but we will be wishing her well on the night.
