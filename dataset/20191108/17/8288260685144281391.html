      <h1>'Massively difficult' - What Hull City fans have said about West Brom</h1>
      <h2>The Baggies head to the East Riding of Yorkshire on Saturday as the two most in form clubs in the whole of the Championship face off before the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:45:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Chapman, https://www.facebook.com/josephchapmanBM/</a></address>
      <p>When Hull City and West Brom cross swords at the KCOM Stadium this weekend, it’ll be a meeting of the division’s top two - that’s based on the form table, at least.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion</a> swept aside rock bottom Stoke City on Monday evening as the Sky Sports cameras broadcast to the world their qualities.</p>
      <p>Two days earlier, though, the Tigers managed the most eye catching result of the weekend in the Championship when they blew expensively assembled Fulham away 3-0 at Craven Cottage.</p>
      <p>Grant McCann’s side are sitting down in 11th but have won their last three - including a victory at Albion’s promotion rivals Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>The Baggies head north prior to the international break looking to retain their grasp on the top spot - this is what the opposing fans this Saturday have been saying about Slaven Bilic’s boys.</p>

      <h3>Hull City fans on Albion</h3>
      <p><b>Matty</b> : Looking forward to Saturday. Should be a good game against a good West Brom side. A win on Saturday and we can surely start to dream again?</p>
      <p><b>Imogen</b> : Imagine if we win on Saturday though, would be unreal</p>
      <p><b>James Fletcher</b> : I’m actually buzzing for Saturday’s game already! Beating #wba would be sensational!</p>

      <p><b>Johnbo</b> : Obviously it’s a tough game this one they are at the top for a reason. Their two wingers are a danger but so are ours.</p>
      <p>Having said that they are strong all over the pitch however it’s another massively difficult test but we should fear no one at the moment. Three points here would be fantastic but after our recent run i would be happy with a point.</p>
      <p><b>John Ex Aberdeen Now ER:</b> I guess there is likely to be 2 ex-City players playing on Saturday Livermore and Townsend, I hope both get at least a polite receptions.</p>

      <h3>Who has been your West Brom player of the season so far?</h3>
      <h4>1000+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Romaine Sawyers Kyle Bartley Jake Livermore Matt Phillips Grady Diangana Matheus Pereira Semi Ajayi Darnell Furlong Hal Robson-Kanu Sam Johnstone Charlie Austin Kyle Edwards Nathan Ferguson Filip Krovinovic Kenneth Zohore Kieran Gibbs</p>
      <p><b>Mark Fisher:</b> They do look a quality outfit.</p>
      <p><b>CJ</b> : Too easy for them playing against a poor out of confidence Stoke team, but Bilic has done a good job up to now since they lost Rodriguez, Gayle and Harvey Barnes from last season</p>
      <p><b>Matthew Garner</b> : Obviously a very talented squad but no reason why we should fear them</p>
      <p><b>Adam Leadbitter:</b> Buzzing to be back at the KCOM again on Saturday, will be a hard test v West Brom but let’s give it a go!</p>
