      <p>FRESNO, Calif. -- Health issues caused by second-hand smoke from cigarettes are well-documented.</p>
      <p>Now, researchers are looking into a potential new issue: lung problems caused by vaping.</p>
      <p>Young people we talked to didn't seem to be worried about breathing in second-hand vapors.</p>
      <p>"It really doesn't bug me," said Issai Rodriguez. "It doesn't bug me. They do their business. I do my business."</p>
      <p>We asked Alyssa Aguilar if it bothers her when people vape around her, she said no, adding, "It doesn't smell like anything, and if it does, it smells good."</p>
      <p>But those fruity and sweet vape flavors can mask nicotine, THC, heavy metals, and potentially harmful chemicals.</p>

      <p>"The solvents they use and the little capsules have problems," said Dr. Tom Horowitz. "The bottom line is you're playing Russian roulette with your lungs."</p>
      <p>Scientists are starting to look into the dangers of second hand vaping fumes.</p>
      <p>Parents like Patricia Ortiz are very concerned about any aerosol vapors in the air.</p>
      <p>"That's one of the reasons why I pick her up," said Ortiz. "I don't want her walking in that crowd because there are a lot that do it. So even if it's not in her hand, she's still breathing it in."</p>
      <p>The long-term effects of vaping are not known, so doctors urge young people to stay away from areas where they might breathe in vaping fumes.</p>
      <p>"You want to keep at least six feet away," said Dr. Horowitz. "You want to avoid going into rooms where there's a lot of vaping going on."</p>
      <p>"They're putting this stuff in their lungs, turning back into a liquid or oil. It's leaving some of that behind in their lungs."</p>

      <p>Robb Holladay tours the country talking about the dangers of vaping, and recently visited Kings Canyon Middle School.</p>
      <p>Holladay says sometimes it can be difficult for kids to avoid the second-hand vapors.</p>
      <p>"Most of the vaping in the school day takes place in the bathroom, in the stalls, so kids tell me, 'Robb, I go to the bathroom, and the vapor is everywhere.'"</p>
      <p>It is a disturbing trend, and concerns over second-hand exposure are rising. A national youth tobacco survey showed a third of middle and high school students are exposed to vaping aerosols.</p>
      <p>Telling friends they don't want to try a vape pen or asking them not to vape in their presence sometimes isn't easy for kids.</p>
      <p>"Peer pressure is very difficult, and at the middle school level even more so," says Kings Canyon Middle School Principal, Edith Navarro.</p>
      <p>Still, some teens want more medical proof the vapors are harmful before having those tough conversations.</p>
      <p>"If it was actually proven that vaping is harmful, I would be a little more conscious of the effects," says Aguilar</p>
      <p>But some of the medical experts we heard from insist, even passive exposure to vaping can pose a health risk.</p>
