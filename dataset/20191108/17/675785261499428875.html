      <h2>WARNING - UPSETTING CONTENT. Police have released harrowing audio from a 911 call in which a little boy says his mum is trying to kill him while body camera footage shows the screaming mother being shot by police</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:51:14+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:51</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Disturbing audio from a 911 call hears a boy screaming for help as he's stabbed by his mum 25 times.</p>
      <p>Police also released body cam footage of the moment officers shot the mum dead.</p>
      <p>Authorities in Henderson, Nevada, say mum Claudia Nadia Rodriguez urged police to take her life when they arrived at her home on October 22, and snatched an officer's gun from him before being shot and killed.</p>
      <p>The cops were responding to a disturbing 911 call made by the 37-year-old mum in which she said: “They’re trying to kill each other. They’re making us do it. We got to kill each other.”</p>
      <p>A little boy can be heard in the background of the call crying and pleading for help, reports <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/homicides/henderson-police-video-shows-woman-who-stabbed-son-was-fatally-shot-1888222/">Las Vegas Review Journal</a> .</p>
      <p>The boy can be heard saying "please don't hurt me" several times and says that his mum is trying to kill him.</p>
      <p>The call then disconnects and attempts by the operator to call back fail.</p>

      <p>Miraculously, the boy is expected to survive after being taken to University Medical Centre in Las Vegas, despite suffering 25 stab wounds.</p>
      <p>The child's dad said his son was "doing good" when local media contacted him the day after the incident.</p>
      <p>Today police released the body camera footage, audio from the 911 call, a photograph of the little boy's blood-stained shirt and a statement about the incident.</p>
      <p>The body camera footage shows two cops knocking on the door to the apartment in the Equestrian on Eastern Apartments, at 10701 S. Eastern Ave.</p>

      <p>To their horror, the young boy opens the door and can be seen to be covered in blood.</p>
      <p>He walks outside and an officer confronts the woman, who appears to be in a state of undress.</p>
      <p>The officer asks "what's going on?" and a struggle ensues where the woman is heard to scream "you got to kill me!"</p>
      <p>She falls to the ground and the officer grabs her legs before shouting to his colleague that she "has a gun".</p>

      <p>His partner then enters the room and shoots her several times.</p>
      <p>Police said today that the mum had grabbed the officer's gun and fired it once. Though this and her being shot is not clearly shown in the footage.</p>
      <p>Henderson Police said the officers involved were Edward Little and Patrick McCarrick but did not say which of them had shot the woman.</p>
      <p>Both have been placed on administrative leave while the shooting continues to be investigated.</p>

      <p>Multiple reports were made to local authorities about the child or the family prior to this incident.</p>
      <p>A report by the Department of Family Services said the department received seven referrals between June 2017 and May 2019.</p>
      <p>An investigation into one of the claims alleging abuse found it was unsubstantiated.</p>
      <p>In 2017 the mum was in a custody dispute with the dad over the son, court records show.</p>

      <p>The boy's dad, Willie Brandon Jr., claimed Rodriguez had a history of domestic violence and had “physically and mentally abused” her two older children from a previous relationship.</p>
      <p>She accused him of making false claims and the parents shared custody of their son.</p>
      <p>Court records show Rodriguez was arrested four times on suspicion of domestic battery between 2015 and March. She also has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic battery in January 2017.</p>
