      <p><b>WRENTHAM, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A judge has dismissed charges against a Massachusetts State Police trooper accused of allegedly drunkenly exposing himself and punching a man in the face during a concert last summer.</p>
      <p>The judge said Friday in Wrentham District Court that no one was willing to testify against Trooper Andrew Patterson. The judge also cited Patterson's military service and lack of a criminal record in approving the motion to dismiss.</p>
      <p>Outside court, Patterson said he and his family have suffered because of false accusations.</p>
      <p>Police say the 32-year-old masturbated in front of a woman and punched her boyfriend during a Luke Bryan show at Gillette Stadium in June.</p>
      <p>Patterson was charged with lewd, wanton and lascivious conduct and suspended without pay.</p>
      <p>The judge said Patterson would have to continue with alcohol treatment.</p>
