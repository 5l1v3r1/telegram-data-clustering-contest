The publisher's chairman and CEO, Strauss Zelnick, also confirmed it was happy with how <i>The Outer Worlds</i> had been performing but wouldn't disclose numbers.</p>
      <p>"It's outperforming our expectations handily, got amazing reviews we're super excited about it, but it's very, very early. So as we learn more, we will disclose more," Zelnick said.</p>

      <p><i>The Outer Worlds</i> was released on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC on October 25. It's been receiving <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-outer-worlds">some pretty stellar reviews</a> with many praising it for its familiar <i>Fallout</i> feel while maintaining interesting side quests and varied environments. How all that will fair on the Switch though is an answer we'll have to wait until early next year for.</p>
      <p>Still, it marks another huge RPG release for the console, which has typically been reserved for less-intensive games. In October, <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/10/the-witcher-3-does-the-best-it-can-on-the-switch/"><i>The Witcher 3</i> was released</a> on the device to mixed reviews with some praising the ability to take Geralt on the road to while others disliked the waxy appearance of the graphics.</p>
