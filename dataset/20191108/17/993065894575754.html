      <p>A SERIOUSLY ill former British soldier will undergo dialysis several times a week as he stands trial in Belfast in relation to a fatal Troubles shooting, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>A barrister for Dennis Hutchings, who has renal failure, told Belfast Crown Court his client will appear in person during March's non-jury trial, despite the 78-year-old previously pledging not to attend proceedings in protest.</p>
      <p>Hutchings, a former member of the Life Guards regiment, has pleaded not guilty to the attempted murder of a man with learning difficulties during the conflict.</p>
      <p>John Pat Cunningham (27) died after being shot in the back as he ran away from an army patrol near Benburb, Co Tyrone, in 1974.</p>
      <p>Hutchings, from Cawsand in Cornwall, denies attempted murder and attempted grievous bodily harm with intent.</p>
      <p>In September he appeared before a judge in Belfast by videolink from Plymouth for arraignment.</p>
      <p>Afterwards he told hundreds of supporters outside Plymouth Crown Court that he would not attend the trial because he did not recognise the legitimacy of the system.</p>
      <p>Hutchings previously failed in a Supreme Court challenge against the decision to hear his case without a jury.</p>
      <p>At Belfast Crown Court on Friday his barrister Ian Turkington said Hutchings was willing to attend the trial.</p>
      <p>"It is his intention to participate in the trial here," he told Mr Justice Adrian Colton.</p>
      <p>Mr Turkington said arrangements were being made with Belfast City Hospital to enable his client to undergo dialysis in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>He said Hutchings, who was excused from attending Friday's preliminary hearing, was having the treatment twice a week but may require it three times a week by March.</p>
      <p>The judge replied: "I note Mr Hutchings will attend trial. I will obviously accommodate any treatment that is required."</p>
      <p>Prosecution barrister Charles MacCreanor QC said it was important that Hutchings had indicated he would attend the proceedings.</p>
      <p>He said his previous "public pronouncements" about his attendance had caused "concern".</p>
