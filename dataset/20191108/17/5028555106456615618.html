      <h2>The Pixel 4 is just two weeks old, and already we're hearing about price cuts.</h2>

      <p>Google's flagship Pixel 4 smartphone is just two weeks old, and we're already getting word of substantial discounts. Black Friday deals on the brand-new phone are starting to come in, and so far the high mark is $400 off the device.</p>
      <p>The biggest deal comes from Best Buy, which has already posted its Black Friday deals. The store is offering <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fblack-friday%2Fcell-phone-ad%2Fpcmcat1568908277830.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1568908277830%26irclickid%3DUlO2zjQswxyJWCm05-R4sULoUknwP7ylI25zQw0%26irgwc%3D1%26ref%3D198%26loc%3DUlO2zjQswxyJWCm05-R4sULoUknwP7ylI25zQw0%26acampID%3D614286&amp;subid1=Pixel4BF">$400 off</a> a Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL, provided you activate it (presumably on a contract) with Sprint, Verizon, or AT&amp;T. That's half off the Pixel 4's $799 price tag. If you'd rather go the unlocked route, Best Buy is offering $200 off an unlocked Pixel 4 or 4XL. Both of these deals have "terms and conditions" that apply, but it doesn't look like Best Buy has posted the details yet.</p>
      <p>It sounds like the Pixel 4 will be discounted everywhere for the holiday season. Target is offering <a href="https://fave.co/2QasNDZ">a $300 gift card</a> with the "qualified activation" of a Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dsy8jg/pixel_4_bfcm_price_leaked_via_google_ad_200_off/f6speoc/">a post</a> on Reddit, Google itself is running ads promising $200 off the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, too, presumably without any kind of carrier commitment.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are pretty pricey compared to the competition. The Pixel 4 costs as much as a Galaxy S10 (when comparing similar storage tiers) but the Pixels have slower storage, smaller batteries, less RAM, fewer cameras, and no Wi-Fi 6 support. OnePlus offers a higher-end device than the Pixel 4, the OnePlus 7T, for $300 less than what Google is charging.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 4 also launches at an awkward time in the year, just a few weeks before the holiday shopping season. Combine the high price and launch timing with the fact that Pixel phones never fly off the shelves (according to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Tech-scroll-Asia/Google-to-shift-Pixel-smartphone-production-from-China-to-Vietnam">the IDC</a>, Google captured 0.3% of the global smartphone market share last year) and the result is usually steep discounts that come quickly. The Pixel 3 ran into the same situation last year, and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/">some early adopters</a> felt burned by the timing and vowed to stop buying the phones at launch.</p>
