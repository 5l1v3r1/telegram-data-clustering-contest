      <h1>Disney+ Announces the European Launch Date for 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:48:31+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>It seems that most of the European fans will have to wait for a little longer to subscribe to Disney+. The upcoming streaming service will launch in a few days in the Netherlands — at the same time as the US. In the rest of Europe, though, the service will become available only on March 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>Disney+’s official Twitter account dropped a short trailer breaking the news to European fans. The video opens with Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury saying “Show them what we get,” teasing a lot of the content that European fans will likely find as soon as they subscribe.</p>
      <p>You can check the full promo in the player below.</p>

      <p>It’s important to note that the content offered by Disney+ will vary by territory. That’s due to the fact that the rights of many of the Disney+ contest may have already been sold to other media platforms. Generally, Europeans will likely find content from the company’s iconic entertainment brands, including Disney, Pixar, Marvel, <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a></b>, National Geographic, and all thirty seasons of <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-simpsons"><b>The Simpsons</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Disney is developing multiple limited series featuring characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier"><b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b></a>, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/loki"><b>Loki</b></a>, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/hawkeye"><b>Hawkeye</b></a>, and <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/wandavision"><b>WandaVision</b></a> being four of the shows in development at the moment. On top of that, Disney has joined forces with the Jim Henson Company to give birth to <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/earth-to-ned"><b>Earth to</b> <b>Ned</b></a>, a unique comedic half-hour puppet talk show. This will be just a small part <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/469347-complete-list-of-disney-plus-launch-titles-revealed">of the huge content</a> Disney is offering to the fans.</p>
      <p>Disney+ launches on November 12 in the US and Netherlands. Are you one of the European fans that will subscribe Disney+ as soon as it launches? Let us know in the comment section below!</p>
