      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - President Donald Trump says he's weighing an invitation from Russia President Vladimir Putin (POO'-tihn) to attend the May 9 Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>
      <p>"I appreciate the invitation," Trump told reporters Friday. "It is right in the middle of political season, so I'll see if I can do it, but I would love to go if I could."</p>
      <p>The event commemorates the May 1945 allied victory over Nazi Germany. Russia uses the annual parade to show off its military might.</p>
      <p>Trump said the event, which next year marks 75th anniversary of the allied victory, was "a very big deal."</p>
