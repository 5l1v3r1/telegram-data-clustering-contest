      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/07/vivo-x30-with-exynos-980-soc-teased-to-be-unveiled-in-december/">Yesterday</a>, VIVO and Samsung held a media communication meeting in Beijing to showcase the joint research and development results of the dual-mode 5G AI chip, Exynos 980. They also shared the story behind the joint research and development for the first time. This cooperation also triggered the industry’s extensive attention to the continued efforts of VIVO in the 5G field.</p>
      <p>Today, VIVO released the series of posters on the official Weibo channel and showcased the four technical highlights of the Exynos 980. It is the industry’s first A77 architecture chip; this SoC is the industry’s first 5G SoC, supporting dual-mode 5G networks; it is a flagship chip with AI computing power.</p>

      <p>The company also said that the VIVO X30 series phones equipped with the dual-mode 5G AI chip Exynos 980 will be available to consumers in December this year.</p>
      <p>As the industry’s first dual-mode 5G SoC product, the Exynos 980 chip supports both NSA and SA 5G networks. This can bring consumers a more comprehensive 5G experience. The Exynos 980 enables ultra-high-speed data communication. As a result, the download rate reaches up to 2.55Gbps, while the download rate can be up to 3.55Gbps.</p>

      <p>It is worth mentioning that the Exynos 980 also integrates the 5G baseband into the SoC. Compared with the external 5G baseband solution, it greatly saves the layout area. Plus, this provides a faster and more energy-efficient performance.</p>
      <h3>Exynos 980 Design</h3>
      <p>For the first time, this Exynos chip uses ARM’s next-generation Cortex-A77 CPU architecture. The latter provides a 20% better on-frequency performance than the Cortex-A76 architecture. Thus, it ensures fast processing of large amounts of data. The chip features a high-performance NPU and DSP unit for flagship computing speeds, as well as a built-in high-performance ISP that can handle images taken at up to 108MP. Due to the AI super-pixel segmentation technology, it can accurately cut the subject and background.</p>
      <p>For VIVO, the joint development of Exynos 980 is undoubtedly groundbreaking. This is the first time that VIVO has penetrated into the chip field and the industry’s leading partners to carry out joint research and development, breaking through the consumer demand to the chip definition stage. Combining the research and innovation advantages of VIVO and Samsung, the two parties jointly completed the optimization of the key performance of Exynos 980.</p>
      <p>In addition, VIVO also expressed awe of the chip industry. In the communication meeting, it clearly stated that the independent design and manufacturing of chips would not be carried out for the time being. But more attention should be paid to the advanced customization and joint development of the chips by the advanced partners in the industry.</p>
