      <h1>Licence plate mandatory even if your car features a zombie and shark tail, Delta police say</h1>
      <h2>The special car had a licence plate on the front dash, but legally must be on the front of the vehicle</h2>

      <p>No matter how cool your car is – a B.C. licence plate has to be attached to it.</p>
      <p>Delta Police are issuing that reminder after an officer came across a vehicle decked out in “car art” on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“At first I thought I was stopping ‘The Batmobile,’” Const. Ken Usipiuk said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>Turns out the owner calls their car “Tha Hora,” and it includes what appears to be a tail on the back end, a large old-style grill on the front and a zombie and half-human creature on the top.</p>
      <p>What it didn’t include, however, was a B.C. licence plate attached onto the front of the special car – required by law under the Motor Vehicle Act.</p>

      <p>“Regardless how famous or unique attach your licence plates to the vehicle not loose on your dash,” Usipiuk said.</p>
      <p>Delta police confirmed that the driver wasn’t issued a ticket and was likely given a verbal or written warning to get the plate attached.</p>
