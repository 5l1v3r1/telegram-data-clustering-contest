      <p>Kanye also stated he’s considering changing his name to ‘Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West’.</p>
      <p>“When people say it’s crass to call yourself a billionaire, I say I might legally change my name to Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West for a year until y’all understand exactly what it is… It will be on the license plate,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Martin Luther King didn’t get killed because he had a dream; he had something else he was gong to talk about,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“He talked about black empowerment, economic empowerment. When I did Forbes, I showed them a $890 million (£768m) receipt and they still didn’t say ‘billionaire’. They don’t want us to know that we can buy land; they don’t want us to have the 100 percent ownership [that] I have at Yeezy.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, West has also chalked up a new record as the first artist to monopolise the entire Top 10 on two <i>Billboard</i> Christian songs charts with tracks from  <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review">‘Jesus Is King’</a>.</p>
