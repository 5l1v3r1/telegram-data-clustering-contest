      <p>The draw was on the back of a 1-0 win in the Telkom Knockout for Abafana Bes’thende over Matsatsantsa.</p>
      <p>Earlier in their campaign, the KwaZulu-Natal outfit beat Polokwane City 2-1 in the league. </p>
      <p>“We played this match just two days after beating the opponent and knocking them out of the Telkom Cup. It was always going to be difficult to beat an opponent that was wounded. They played 4-3-3 and stuck to their system,” said Komphela about the Matsatsantsa draw, as quoted on Arrows’ official website.</p>

      <p>“We played a much, much better game compared to the first one. We kept the ball longer and we defended our areas very well in areas where we preferred the opponent to have the ball, we were successful and there were no real threats. Our defenders dealt with Gabuza very well,” the ex-Kaizer Chiefs coach added. </p>
      <p>About Sunday afternoon’s match against Sundowns at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium, the coach said, “We are on again in preparation against Mamelodi Sundonws in 4 days to complete the third match in eight days.” </p>
      <p>Arrows and Sundowns will also play in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on November 23.   </p>
