      <h1>Las Vegas bans homeless people from sleeping rough if shelter beds available</h1>

      <p>Las Vegas has passed a law banning sleeping on the street if there are places in homeless shelters available. </p>
      <p>To combat the growing number of homeless people in the city, the new law will impose punishments of a $1,000 fine and six months in prison.</p>
      <p>The ordinance - the latest in a series of measures by US cities to grapple with rising vagrancy - comes into force on Sunday, but its criminal provisions will not be applied until February.</p>
      <p>Sleeping on the streets of the gambling hub will only be illegal in downtown Las Vegas and residential areas - not the famous casino "Strip," which comes under a different jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>It will not apply when homeless shelters are full.</p>
      <p>Opponents of the law focused their anger on Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman before and during the vote late Wednesday.</p>

      <p>Demonstrators outside City Hall chanted "Housing, not handcuffs" and held signs proclaiming "Poverty is not a crime," local media reported.</p>
      <p>Ms Goodman said the law is necessary for a city that is highly dependent on tourism revenues and to protect "the health and safety of the entire community."</p>
      <p>The law is not intended to punish the homeless but to help with their reintegration into society, she said, according to NPR radio.</p>
      <p>It has been backed by Las Vegas's Chamber of Commerce.</p>
      <p>According to the latest census, 5,500 people sleep on the streets of southern Nevada each night. Only 2,000 beds are available through municipal services and charities.</p>
