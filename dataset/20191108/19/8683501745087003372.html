      <p>We’re a little over a week away from <i>Justice League</i>’s two-year anniversary, and it remains a popular subject among comic book movie fans. Well, not so much <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478789/original-justice-league-cinematographer-cried-watching-the-theatrical-cut">the theatrical release</a> as much as what could have been, i.e. if Zack Snyder’s original <i>Justice League</i> vision has been kept intact, which is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483683/yes-jason-momoa-has-seen-the-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-and-its-very-different">now referred to as The Snyder Cut</a>.</p>
      <p>In the years since <i>Justice League</i> hit theaters, Zack Snyder hasn’t been shy about sharing <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475434/zack-snyder-reveals-another-green-lantern-hint-that-would-have-been-in-his-justice-league">pictures of moments he shot that were removed from the theatrical cut</a>, and his latest peek shows Ezra Miller’s Barry Allen, a.k.a. The Flash, with a woman we didn’t see in the finalized <i>Justice League</i>.</p>

      <p>Outside of Barry Allen visiting his father, Henry (played by Billy Crudup) in prison, we didn’t really get to see much of the speedster’s personal life in <i>Justice League</i>, but Zack Snyder intended to shed more light on Barry’s life when he wasn’t zipping around. In this picture, which Snyder shared on <a href="https://vero.co/">Vero</a>, we see Barry talking with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1580930/the-flash-character-who-filmed-a-justice-league-cameo">Iris West, played by Kiersey Clemons</a>. Iris has been an integral part of the Flash mythos for decades, and <i>Justice League</i> was intended to be her theatrical debut. “Cute couple” indeed.</p>
      <p>As you can see in the below video, Barry Allen would have seen that Iris West was in danger and used his super speed to save her, though it’s unclear if the two of them already knew each or if this would have been their first meeting. The shot of Barry shattering the glass was <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1727509/every-justice-league-trailer-scene-that-wasnt-in-the-actual-movie/?story_page=3">kept inside one of the <i>Justice League</i> trailers</a>.</p>

      <p>Alas, in September 2017, it was reported that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1706149/justice-league-leaves-another-expected-cast-member-on-the-cutting-room-floor">Kiersey Clemons’ <i>Justice League</i> cameo had been removed</a>, although she wasn’t the only actor who suffered that fate. Willem Dafoe’s scenes as Nuidis Vulko were also cut, and he instead debuted in Aquaman. <i>Justice League</i> was also supposed to show Ryan Choi and Darkseid, with the latter being shown in both <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476433/zack-snyder-shows-again-how-young-darkseid-couldve-looked-in-justice-league">the flashback battle</a> and towards the end of the movie after Steppenwolf was defeated.</p>
      <p>While things didn’t work out for Iris West in <i>Justice League</i>, there’s still a chance we could see Kiersey Clemons’ version of the character. Despite its many setbacks, The Flash is still in development, and when last we heard, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478890/sorry-andy-muschiettis-the-flash-movie-wont-contain-any-elements-of-horror"><i>IT</i>’s Andy Muschietti had been tapped to direct</a>. As far as we know, Clemons is still set to play Iris in this movie, so unless there’s a recasting in store, if The Flash finally gets off the ground, presumably the Iris role will remain hers.</p>
      <p>The future of the DCEU looks a lot different than what was envisioned before <i>Justice League</i> came out, and of the six founding members of the cinematic team, only Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman and Jason Momoa’s Aquaman have more movies coming up. There are no plans for Superman and Cyborg at this time, and while <i>The Batman</i> will begin shooting soon, this will be a separate project that sees <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483624/the-batmans-robert-pattinson-reveals-his-comic-book-research">Robert Pattinson playing the Caped Crusader</a>.</p>
      <p>So Ezra Miller’s Flash is the last of <i>Justice League</i>’s main lineup who still stands a chance of sticking around, but whether he’ll keep playing the character or someone else is hired to play Barry Allen, Iris West is a key character to include in any movie centered on him. As for if we’ll ever see this Barry/Iris scene from <i>Justice League</i> in full, well, that depends on <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481693/zack-snyder-speechless-over-release-the-snyder-cut-efforts-at-new-york-comic-con">if the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement is ultimately successful</a>.</p>
