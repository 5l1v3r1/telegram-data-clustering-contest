      <p>Neil Jones has confirmed he will return to Strictly Come Dancing with his partner Alex Scott on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The professional dancer missed the last two live shows due to injury, leaving Scott to dance with Kevin Clifton.</p>
      <p>However, he saw a physiotherapist on Friday morning, who gave him the all-clear to dance.</p>

      <p>He told Strictly spin-off show It Takes Two: “It’s great to be back, she’s been doing so well every week, and Kevin, I have to say thank you because Kevin has been there all the way, and he’s been great this week.</p>
      <p>“We couldn’t have done it without him.”</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Jones was not yet sure whether he would be able to dance this weekend.</p>
      <p>Former footballer Scott said she was thrilled to get back on the dancefloor with her “normal partner”, but was grateful for Clifton’s help.</p>
      <p>Clifton stepped in to help train Scott and perform with her over the past two weekends after Jones sustained a leg muscle injury in training</p>
      <p>Scott said “it has been strange going back from Kev to Neil” in recent days.</p>
      <p>Of their dance for this weekend, a jive to Let’s Twist Again by Chubby Checker, Scott said it is “fun, it is full-on, energy”.</p>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing airs at 6.50pm on Saturday, BBC One.</p>
