      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>Temperature is expected to drop to 13 degrees Celsius to 15 degrees Celsius on Saturday after a cold spell hit Karachi, as well as other areas of Sindh.</p>
      <p>The mercury drastically fell by eight degrees to 15 degrees Celsius in the port city on Friday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).</p>
      <p>Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz said the recent drop in temperature in the city has broken the previous record of average minimum temperature recorded in Karachi in November, which is 16 degrees Celsius. He attributed the sudden fall in temperature to the drop in temperatures in Quetta and Qalat, a system of cold wind entering the country and recent spells of rainfall in northern areas and Islamabad. Sarfaraz said that the cold spell will last over the next few days.</p>
