      <p>MONTREAL — Fiera Capital Corp. says it swung to a loss in the third quarter, mainly because of higher expenses from recent acquisitions that closed in the quarter.</p>
      <p>"Our focus during the third quarter was on integrating our recently closed acquisitions and building a strong global operations and IT platform," said company CEO Jean-Guy Desjardins in a statement Friday.</p>
      <p>Fiera has recently closed its acquisitions of Foresters Asset Management Inc., Integrated Asset Management Corp., and Natixis Investment Managers Canada Corp., which together added $15 billion to its assets under management.</p>
