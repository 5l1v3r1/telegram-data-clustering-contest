      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nation</a>'s envoy for Syria says first talks in Geneva on the country's constitution involving Syrian opposition, government and civil society representatives have "gone much better" than many would have expected.</p>
      <p>Geir Pedersen said on Friday that the two co-chairs of the constitutional committee from President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/bashar-al-assad.html">Bashar al-Assad</a>'s government and the leading opposition have agreed to meet again on November 25, and that delegations would in coming weeks "hopefully come up with a work plan".</p>

      <p>Representatives of both sides met to discuss a future constitution, part of plans for a political settlement to end eight and a half years of war.</p>
      <p>Expectations for the talks have been low, with Damascus and its Iranian and Russian allies having made gains on the battlefield that left them few reasons to grant concessions.</p>
      <p>Acknowledging that discussions were sometimes difficult, UN envoy Geir Pedersen said delegates from the government, opposition and civil society had behaved with professionalism.</p>
      <p>"These are sometimes very painful discussions and it takes courage to listen to the other side defending its views on these issues," he told journalists in Geneva.</p>
      <p>"I believe it has gone much better than most people would have expected," he said.</p>
      <p>The government delegation had been seeking to hold the next round of talks in Syria's capital, which the opposition had strongly resisted.</p>
      <p>The talks are focused on drawing up a constitution with a view to eventually holding elections in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a>, a less sweeping agenda than at UN-sponsored talks earlier in the war, which collapsed over rebel demands that al-Assad leave power.</p>
      <p>Rebel fighters who once aimed to overthrow al-Assad now hold only a small pocket of northwestern Syria and have been driven out of all its major population centres.</p>
      <h3>'Not very easy'</h3>
      <p>The talks kicked off last week with a ceremony and plenary session involving 150 delegates - split evenly between Syria's government, the opposition and Syrian civil society.</p>
      <p>After 10 days of talks, there was no immediate agreement on the release of thousands of detainees, an issue that Pedersen has underscored as key to building confidence.</p>
      <p>Nor was there consensus on whether delegates from the so-called "small group" in charge of drafting the constitution would adapt a 2012 constitution or start afresh with a new one.</p>
      <p>Damascus has indicated it is merely willing to tweak the existing constitution, but Ahmed Kuzbari, the meeting co-chair representing the government-backed delegation, told reporters both scenarios were possible.</p>
      <p>"We could draft a new constitution as long as it meets all of the objectives of the Syrian state," he said, insisting on respect for Syrian sovereignty.</p>
      <p>"We did not come to build a new state. The Syrian Arab Republic is a state: it has a constitution, a parliament, a government, an army and institutions," Kuzbari added.</p>
      <p>Talks between the parties were often heated, delegates said, particularly on the issue of "terrorism", a term used by the government side to refer to rebels, with the government body seeking to incorporate this within the constitutional reform project. The opposition side resisted this.</p>
      <p>"Discussions were not very easy," the opposition co-chair Hadi al-Bahra said, noting that he had yet to shake hands with his counterpart.</p>
      <p>"We all had to be reasonable and go beyond the differences and to focus on the parts that unify Syrians."</p>
