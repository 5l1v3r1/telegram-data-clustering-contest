      <h1>The latest Nvidia GPU driver plugs a bunch of security holes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T19:25:29+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/paul-lilly/" target="_blank">Paul Lilly</a></address>
      <p>Several days ago, Nvidia pushed out a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-fires-off-a-new-gpu-driver-to-prep-your-pc-for-red-dead-redemption-2/">new GeForce driver</a> update, version 441.12. The highlight of the latest driver is it's optimized for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-tips/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, though there's another reason to consider installing itâ€”to plug several security holes.</p>
      <p>Nvidia posted a security bulletin that outlines nine different vulnerabilities that were recently patched. The most severe are CVE-2019-5690 and CVE-2019-5691, both of which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack. There are several others that could as well.</p>
      <p>On consumer GeForce cards, the vulnerabilities exist on all versions prior to 441.12, which was released on November 4. Some people prefer to wait a bit before installing a new driver, to make there are no issues with it. However, if you're running anything earlier, you may want to update to the latest release to stave off these potential threats, even if you don't plan to play RDR2. (Maybe you're hoping it will get marked down when the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> arrive.)</p>
