      <p>BEIJING: The head of China's top state-run semiconductor maker, Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd, called on US companies to "do better" in efforts to overcome China-US tech tensions given they continue to profit from the Chinese market.</p>
      <p>Semiconductors have been a major flash point in the ongoing trade war between the two countries, with US officials criticising what they say are state-subsidised efforts to undermine the US chip industry.</p>

      <p>In recent years China has invested billions of dollars in its semiconductor industry, including contributions to a high-end Tsinghua Unigroup memory chip plant said to be worth US$24 billion.</p>
      <p>Tsinghua Unigroup chairman Zhao Weiguo said at a conference in Beijing on Friday that US firms should "relax and sleep well", urging them not to be threatened by China's semiconductor ambitions, and to play a greater role in easing tensions.</p>
      <p>"On the one hand, they're earning lots of money here in China, and on the other hand, they're making malicious remarks about China to the US government behind the scenes."</p>
      <p>"US companies can do better, especially technology giants. Some American companies do well, and some do not," said Zhao.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Tsinghua Unigroup said it had begun producing China's first high-end 64-layer 3D NAND flash memory chips, a major competitive technology currently dominated by US and South Korean firms. State media hailed the project as a "breakthrough" in the county's efforts to shorten technological gaps with foreign countries.</p>
      <p>China and the US recently agreed to roll back tariffs as part of a pending "phase one" trade deal. Chinese negotiators have previously sought relief from 25 per cent tariffs on a group of goods that include semiconductors.</p>
