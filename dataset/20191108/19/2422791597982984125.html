      <p>OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is losing his second national security adviser in as many years to retirement.</p>
      <p>Greta Bossenmaier will leave her post in early December after a 35-year career in the public service.</p>
      <p>Bossenmaier served as Trudeau's national security and intelligence adviser since May 2018, when she replaced the retiring Daniel Jean.</p>
      <p>Before moving to the prime minister's office, Bossenmaier spent three years as the head of the Communications Security Establishment.</p>
      <p>Trudeau says Bossenmaier "has served Canadians with dedication, integrity, and excellence" in her lengthy career.</p>
      <p>He is tapping David Morrison, the foreign and defence policy adviser, to temporarily step in to Bossenmaier's chair while a permanent replacement is sought.</p>
