      <p>CATALIST-LISTED Chinese phosphate miner AsiaPhos, which earlier this year saw a wholly owned subsidiary slapped by former employees’ claims for severance pay, said in a bourse filing on Friday that some of the claims have been voluntarily withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Twenty former staff members of its Sichuan Mianzhu Norwest Phosphate Chemical Co unit had sought about 1.84 million yuan (S$358,600) in severance pay from the Chinese courts.</p>
      <p>While the claim was dismissed in September by the Mianzhu Municipal People’s Court, a dozen of the former employees brought an appeal to the Deyang Intermediate Court in mid-October.</p>
      <p>Now, AsiaPhos has said that 11 of the 12 former employees’ claims have been voluntarily withdrawn, according to a written notice received on Nov 7.</p>
      <p>Separately, Mianzhu Norwest received another notice of claim in October over 20 former employees’ claim of about 870,000 yuan in the Mianzhu Municipal People’s Court.</p>

      <p>Shares in AsiaPhos did not trade on Friday, but last closed at 0.8 Singapore cent.</p>
