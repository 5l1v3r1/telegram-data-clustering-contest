      <h2>COLUMN: The Blades boss is proving his worth in the top flight and has been a breath of fresh air. If he can carry it on the big clubs are bound to come calling for him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T19:03:31+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 19:03</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Savage, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robbie-savage/</a></address>
      <p>Patronised as too basic for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> , and a manager with a so-called ‘dinosaur’ approach who allegedly preaches direct football, let’s hear it for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sheffield-united-fc">Sheffield United</a> .</p>
      <p>Sixth in the table, with the joint best defensive record in the country, the Blades’ fine start is no fluke.</p>
      <p>Damned with faint praise by too many pundits – some of whom probably haven’t seen them play that much – <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chris-wilder">Chris Wilder’s</a> team deserve proper analysis.</p>
      <p>Wilder was accused of ‘dinosaur’ man-management after goalkeeper Dean Henderson’s howler against Liverpool, but his tough love has been totally vindicated.</p>
      <p>Compared with the three keepers named in England’s latest squad, Henderson has kept five clean sheets, conceded the fewest goals (eight), and has the highest save percentage (78%).</p>
      <p>If Wilder’s a dinosaur, I would argue the T-Rex is doing a great job at getting the best out of his players.</p>

      <p>I have nothing but admiration for the way the Sheffield United boss has stuck to his principles and hasn’t compromised on his overlapping centre-backs.</p>
      <p>This season, Blades defender Chris Basham ranks eighth among Premier League centre-backs for most dribbles attempted, while Jack O’Connell is fifth for the most crosses completed.</p>
      <p>If you look at Wilder’s team, in terms of flair and individual star quality, they haven’t really got any.</p>
      <p>But what he has fostered is a unique style underpinned by a top-class work ethic.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The way he dealt with Henderson’s blooper was a manager at the top of his game, knowing when to put an arm round his players or when to give them a kick up the backside.</p>
      <p>He has brought them up from League One and their conviction has earned them a win and a clean sheet against Arsenal, a point from 2-0 down at Chelsea and a win at Everton.</p>
      <p>These Blades are a cut above. They have been a breath of fresh air, and no wonder Bramall Lane is rocking every game.</p>

      <p>In terms of fighting spirit, desire and no real superstars but a sense of togetherness, Wilder’s team reminds me of the Leicester side Martin O’Neill built in the late 1990s. We finished seventh in the Premier League and won the League Cup.</p>
      <p>Don’t forget, Wilder beat Pep Guardiola to the LMA manager of the year gong last season – when Manchester City completed a domestic treble.</p>
      <p>And if Sheffield United stay up, playing the same brand of football, he will be a contender for the same award again.</p>

      <p>I am in no hurry to tout Wilder for other people’s posts, but given the Blades’ flying start back in the top flight, I have to ask the question.</p>
      <p>How long is it before Chris Wilder gets a crack at one of the top jobs?</p>
      <p>If he was in charge of a side playing with such style and a mean defensive record in Europe, clubs over here would be falling over themselves to land him.</p>
