      <p>In its results filing, Venture said it expects "some uncertainties in the business and geopolitical environment may remain unabated", and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) continue to shift their supply chain flows to mitigate tariff effects. It takes advantage of these shifts to render support to its partners, Venture added.</p>
      <p>It will be supporting several partners in new and key product launches over the next 12 months, and expects to see traction in its entries into new technology domains and ecosystems. It plans to continue investing in growing its capabilities in these areas through multilateral partnerships.</p>
      <p>Venture shares closed up 10 Singapore cents or 0.61 per cent to S$16.60 on Friday before results were announced.</p>
