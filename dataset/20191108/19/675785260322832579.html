      <h1>Strictly's injured Neil Jones confirms he will be dancing on Saturday</h1>
      <h2>The Strictly star, 37, has had to patiently wait to find out if he can dance again tomorrow after paying a visit to the physio</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T19:04:50+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 19:04</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Jones has confirmed that he will be dancing on Saturday's Strictly show.</p>
      <p>The professional dancer, 37, has missed two weeks of live shows after sustaining a calf muscle injury during training - with fellow pro dancer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kevin-clifton">Kevin Clifton</a> , 37, having to step in to train with partner Alex Scott.</p>
      <p>Appearing on It Takes Two today while in rehearsals, he and Alex revealed that they would be dancing together tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Gethin Jones, Alex admitted it had been a "weird" few weeks but that she finally knew who she was dancing with tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"I am dancing with my normal partner Neil Jones!" she exclaimed happily as she was joined by Neil at her side.</p>

      <p>The pro went on to thank Kevin for stepping in, saying that he had been "great this week" and that they couldn't have done it without him.</p>
      <p>Neil had an exam with the physio today - meaning he and Alex will have only had one day before show time on Saturday to know which one of the boys will be dancing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/injured-strictly-come-dancing-pro-20835503">He appeared on Strictly It Takes Two</a> earlier this week when he said that he was still waiting to hear whether he would be dancing on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Appearing next to Alex, 35, and Kevin, a distraught Neil admitted: "I'm really hoping. I still don't know.</p>

      <p>"I've been dancing a lot today. I've been doing that. It's been feeling good, but I need to be passed by the physio."</p>
      <p>Alex added: "I've been dancing with both, and Neil will make the decision.</p>
      <p>"If he's 100%, I know he will go out there and dance. Actually, I just want to say how frustrating it's been for Neil.</p>

      <p>"Just hearing everybody speak about me dancing with Kev, and this guy is amazing! I want to be at the level that I'm at with him right now. Whether I'm dancing with Neil or I'm dancing with Kev, they are both amazing guys."</p>
      <p>Neil's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/strictly-come-dancings-neil-katya-20754692">painful injury</a> is believed to be either a torn knee ligament or a pulled calf muscle, which can take up to six weeks for a full recovery.</p>

      <p>He took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>  earlier this week to reveal that he's been taking long ice baths so he can return to the dancefloor with partner Alex.</p>
      <p>Neil tweeted: "I've never had so many ice baths in all my life. Truthfully @Joe_Sugg would have no chance against me at an ICEBATH challenge. I can do 20mins."</p>
