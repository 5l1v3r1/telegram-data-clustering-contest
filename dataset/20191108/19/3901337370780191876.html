      <p>Chippa United’s opponents for this weekend, AmaZulu, aim to worsen their situation in Port Elizabeth at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday. </p>
      <p>While Chippa coach Norman Mapeza has spoken about the improvement of his team as he chases their first win of the season, his counterpart from AmaZulu, Jozef Vukusic is aiming for a third successive victory with his charges.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Chippa have scored just three goals this season and are at the bottom of the Absa Premiership log, having conceded 11 times. </p>
      <p>“We have won our last two games but we know we have to work hard to continue that form going forward. Our confidence levels are high but we take every game as it comes, so we have to make sure we are ready if we are going to take maximum points against Chippa on Saturday,” Vukusic said, as quoted on AmaZulu’s official website.</p>

      <p>“They are a good team who have been unlucky in some games, they could have beaten Sundowns but they did not take their chances. Our defence has to be wary of the threat they have going forward and keep them at bay, and we will have to capitalise on our chances to walk away with another win,” the Slovakian coach added.</p>

      <p>“As long as the team is getting the wins, I am happy. It is good to have a player like Ntuli in our side but we have other offensive options as well. Majoro, Maduna and Ncobeni have all had chances, they need to start scoring as well so we are not so reliant on Ntuli. We have not had much time for training, as we have two games this week. We will give certain players a rest, to regain their fitness, so it is a good opportunity to rotate the team and give other players a chance to prove themselves,” concluded the coach.    </p>
