      <p>Amazon has the Nokia 7.1 <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> today for just $209. That is a really good price on this unlocked smartphone. In fact, it is the lowest price that the Nokia 7.1 has ever been. Making this a really great time to pick one up.</p>
      <p>The Nokia 7.1 is a really great mid-range smartphone from HMD Global. It has been replaced by the Nokia 7.2, but it's still getting updates and still runs pretty well. That's thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset inside, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage.</p>
      <p>Nokia has a 5.84-inch full HD+ HDR display on the 7.1. It does have a notch, which takes up most of the forehead of the phone. But it could be worse, and look like the Pixel 3 XL's notch.</p>

      <p>There is also a dual-camera setup on the backside of the phone. With a 12-megapixel sensor and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. HMD Global is still using Carl Zeiss optics on its smartphones. So you know that these cameras are actually going to be pretty good. And on the front, there is a 8-megapixel camera for taking selfies.</p>
      <p>Nokia 7.1 runs on Android 10 now, and it is an Android One device. So HMD Global is able to update it pretty quickly. Allowing you to get quick updates and quick security updates. HMD Global promises two years of OS updates and three years of security updates, but usually provides more than that, and that's always nice to see.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Nokia 7.1 is unlocked. But it doesn't have CDMA compatibility. So this is still going to work on AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in the US. Just don't expect it to work on Verizon and Sprint, unfortunately.</p>

      <p>You can pick up the unlocked Nokia 7.1 from Amazon <a href="https://geni.us/aLZojS">by clicking here</a>. But you'd better hurry, as this price isn't going to last long and this Nokia 7.1 sale is going to sell quick.</p>
