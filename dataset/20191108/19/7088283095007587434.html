        <b>British rock singer Pete Doherty was arrested and taken into custody in Paris Friday after being caught buying cocaine, according to police.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Libertines frontman tried to resist arrest after being caught in the early hours of Friday carrying two packets of cocaine, one of which he had partly consumed, a police source told the AFP news agency.</p>
      <p>Doherty, 40, who was drunk, tried to get rid of the drugs before being arrested in the Ninth Arrondissement, which includes the area around Pigalle known for its lively night life.</p>
      <p>The bad boy of British rock, as famous for having dated supermodel Kate Moss as for his music, has repeatedly made headlines for drugs offences.</p>
      <p>In 2012, he was thrown out of a luxury rehab clinic in Thailand after claims he was a bad influence on other patients and did not try hard enough to kick his heroin habit.</p>
