      <p>New Celta boss Oscar Garcia insisted he has no magic wand to beat Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The former Brighton manager takes charge of his first game at his former club on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Garcia replaced Fran Escriba, who was sacked after the 1-0 defeat by Getafe which left Celta in 18th place having lost their last four games.</p>

      <p>And the ex-Watford boss, who started his career at the Nou Camp, knows the task ahead.</p>
      <p>He told Spanish news outlet Sport: “We have worked things, but I am not a magician. We play first and foremost Barca, a very good team that has incorporated great players like (Frenkie) De Jong or (Antoine) Griezmann.</p>
      <p>“There is no clear idea to hurt them.</p>
      <p>“We are going to go play our game and I hope we regain our confidence. That, at least, it will help us. We will try to win.</p>

      <p>“We know the field we are going and the situation in which they are in, but we must focus a lot on us, to improve every week and every day to be better.</p>
      <p>“There are weaves but we have to work on some things that are very improvable and that is where we are going to have a big impact.</p>
      <p>“I want the fans to feel proud of how we play and of the feeling we have when we play. I believe in that a lot.”</p>

      <p>Garcia is without injured Barca loanee Rafinha, with Santi Mina, Claudio Beauvue and Kevin Vazquez also sidelined.</p>
      <p>Barcelona’s left-back Jordi Alba has suffered a reoccurance of his hamstring injury and is also out.</p>
      <p>Boss Ernesto Valverde’s position at Barca has been under constant scrutiny this season.</p>
      <p>They are top of LaLiga, ahead of Real Madrid on goal difference.</p>

      <p>Valverde told a press conference: “We need a win and to get back to picking up three points at a time. We’re motivated to stay top the standings.</p>
      <p>“Celta have good players and it’s not normal for them to have so few goals with the players they have. It’s a team that will get out of the bottom part of the standings.</p>
      <p>“They have talent and they’ll show it.”</p>
