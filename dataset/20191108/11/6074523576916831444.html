      <h1>Bitcoin’s Weekly Chart May See Golden Cross for First Time in 3.5 Years</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin’s short-term 50-period moving average is edging closer toward the longer-term 100-period moving average on the weekly chart, hinting at a potential bullish “golden cross” formation for the first time in 3.5 years.</li>
        <li>In the shorter term, however, total weekly volume has fallen period-to-period as indecision continues to grip the market.</li>
        <li>Price action is caught between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs). The next major move either way is likely to determine trend bias going forward, if a firm close above or below those averages is confirmed.</li>

      <p>Bitcoin (BTC) looks on track to produce a bullish long-term signal not seen in 3.5 years.</p>
      <p>The 50-period and the 100-period MAs have edged closer together on the weekly chart after BTC rebounded from $7,293 to $10,350 on Oct. 26, according to Bitstamp data.</p>
      <p>A cross of the 50-period MA moving up above the slower 100-period MA, known as a golden cross, generally hints at a strong shift in a trend and can act as confirmation of a bullish bias for the long-term view.</p>
      <p>The last time that bull cross occurred on the weekly chart was way back in May 2016, when the price of BTC started rising from $438 to near $20,000 in December 2017 – a 4,800 percent increase. If the MA’s continue to converge as currently, the cross looks likely in late December or early 2020, but it’s still too early for a precise call.</p>

      <p>There is inherent risk involved with making such comparisons from previous years, as market conditions have changed significantly. Yet there is merit for seeking additional confirmation in the long-term trend, since BTC’s miner reward halving in May 2020 is likely to stir up a bunch of market activity as the supply-cutting event approaches.</p>
      <p>Total weekly volume has shrunk from two weeks ago, an indication of market indecision on a fairly stagnant price, while the RSI is barely trending bullish above 52.7 (neutral being 50).</p>
      <p>However, should the two lines converge and then cross bullish,  that would be a strong indication that the 2019 reversal rally has legs. With a strong fundamental event for BTC occurring right around the corner, it’s important to take note of the bullish signals on larger time frames.</p>
      <p>More immediately, the daily chart suggests market equilibrium, as prices have been largely stuck within a $650 range for nearly two weeks.</p>
      <h4>Daily chart</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>BTC’s price action has been caught between the 100-day and 200-day MAs for 12 days.</p>
      <p>Generally speaking, when prices are above the 200-day MA, the long-term trend can be considered bullish. Conversely, if prices are beneath the 100-day MA then that is an indication of mid-term (30-60 day) bearish conditions.</p>
      <p>The current scenario highlights the indecisive sentiment felt across the market. A repeated failure to close above the 100-day MA could open up doors to $8,800 in the immediate short-term, as previously <a href="http://coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-risks-drop-below-9k-if-bulls-cant-muster-rally-soon">discussed</a>.</p>
      <p>Indecision will continue until a firm close above $9,573 (100-day MA) or below $9,180 (200-day MA) occurs with conviction, until then, continued sideways ranging can be expected.</p>
