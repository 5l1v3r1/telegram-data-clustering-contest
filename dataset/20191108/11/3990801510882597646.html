      <h1>Blockchain devs looking for work are spoiled for choice right now</h1>
      <h2>It's a great time if you're looking for a job</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:57:33+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:57</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Beedham</a></address>
      <p>Despite regulatory concerns, businesses are still pushing forward and hiring for blockchain and cryptocurrency positions.</p>
      <p>Based on a <a href="https://www.beseen.com/blog/talent/bitcoin-job-market-2019-beyond/">report from job site Indeed</a>, there is less interest from candidates in blockchain and cryptocurrency roles, as searches for the jobs are on the decrease. On the other hand, Indeed says employer demand has “skyrocketed.”</p>
      <p>To come to this conclusion, Indeed analyzed the “percentage change in the share of job postings and share of job searches per million for roles related to Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain.”</p>
      <p>Between September 2015 and September 2019 the number of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related jobs per million increased by over 1,400 percent.</p>
      <p>Across that same time period though, searches only increased by 469 percent. What’s more, candidate interest in the field has been on a downward trend since 2018.</p>

      <p>Over the past year, cryptocurrency job postings per million have increased by 26 percent. Despite this, the number of searches per million have decreased by 53 percent.</p>
      <p>This is the first time in four years that employer demand has gone up but candidate demand has gone down.</p>
      <h3>Big business gets the job done</h3>
      <p>As you might expect, the top five jobs in blockchain and cryptocurrency are for engineers, developers, and software architects.</p>
      <p>Further to an <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/08/blockchain-jobs-glassdoor-employment/">investigation conducted by Hard Fork</a> earlier this year, the top blockchain and crypto employers are old-school corporate firms.</p>
      <p>According to Indeed, Deloitte, IBM, and Accenture are the top three employers in the decentralized tech.</p>
      <p>The likes of Ernst &amp; Young, JP Morgan Chase, and Cisco also make the top 15 companies doing the most hiring for Bitcoin and blockchain jobs.</p>
      <p>Based on its findings, Indeed expects these trends to continue into next year, regardless of the regulatory uncertainty facing some projects, like Facebook’s Libra.</p>
      <p>With all that in mind, it looks like there’s never been a better time to branch out and find a new career. That is, if you have development skills in Python, Hyperledger, and Ethereum’s Solidity, and want to work in blockchain-based tech.</p>
