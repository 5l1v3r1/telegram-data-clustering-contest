      <h1>Max Verstappen's records will mean nothing without titles, admits Jos Verstappen</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>, at such a young age still, has set numerous Formula 1 records already in his career; but they will all be meaningless unless he can start winning titles, his father Jos has admitted.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 22-year-old is the youngest ever driver in a Grand Prix; youngestever points-scorer and winner in Formula One history and also passed 100 race starts in the USA recently.</p>
      <p>However, Verstappen has been at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a>, who, in recent years, have been behind <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> in terms of pace and have failed to sustain a purposeful title challenge.</p>

      <p>Father Jos has admitted that all of the records will eventually be broke and forgotten, unlike titles that stay in the memory forever, in an interview withÂ <i>De Telegraaf: "We don't need the record for the most number of races. We have to become the world champion."</i></p>
      <p>Verstappen has recorded two race victories this season, firstly in Austria at Red Bull's home circuit, and then at a rain-struck German Grand Prix, where the Dutchman held his nerve in the tricky conditions.</p>
      <p>His future at Red Bull remains uncertain, but he is almost definitely going to be with the Milton Keynes-based squad for the 2020 season, but if he is serious about his title credentials, he might look elsewhere to the likes of Mercedes or Ferrari.</p>
