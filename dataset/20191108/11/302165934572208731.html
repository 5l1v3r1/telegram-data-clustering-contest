      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 8 — The ringgit retreated from yesterday’s gains to close lower against the US dollar today, as positive sentiment on the US-China trade negotiations shifted investors’ appetite back to safe-haven currencies, dealers said.</p>
      <p>At 6pm, the ringgit was quoted at 4.1310/1360 against the greenback from 4.1225/1255 on Thursday. </p>
      <p>A dealer said that the greenback had regained its momentum on news that China and the US agreed to roll back tariffs as part of a potential preliminary pact to end their trade war.</p>
      <p>However, a news report today stated that there is still some scepticism about a trade deal as officials inside and outside the White House have bristled at the notion of giving up punitive tariffs.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the local note traded higher against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The ringgit strengthened against the Singapore dollar to 3.0377/0418 from 3.0382/0408 yesterday and went up against the yen to 3.7774/7830 from 3.7797/7828.</p>
      <p>It appreciated against the British pound to 5.2906/2986 from 5.3036/3095 and increased versus the euro to 4.5594/5666 from 4.5661/5706. — Bernama</p>
