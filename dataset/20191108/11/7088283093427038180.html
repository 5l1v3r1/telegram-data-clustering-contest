      <p>A pair of boots worn by Napoleon during his final exile in St. Helena are to go under the hammer in Paris later this month.</p>
      <p>The size 40 boots (roughly seven in British measure) were given to a sculptor working on an equestrian statue of Bonaparte by General Henri Gatien Bertrand, who had followed the French leader into exile on the far-flung South Atlantic island after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, auctioneers said.</p>
      <p>The shoes are expected to fetch between 50,000 and 80,000 euros (£69,000) when they are sold at the Drouot auction rooms on November 29.</p>
      <p>Napoleon had a large collection of footwear, which he bought from the Paris shoemakers Jacques in Montmartre.</p>
      <p>Although British propagandists often caricatured the Corsican as an authoritarian midget, at 1.69 metres (five foot two inches) he was actually above average height for his time.</p>
      <p>The boots were gifted by the son of sculptor Carlo Marochetti to the French politician Paul Le Roux, a minister under the Second Empire of Bonaparte's nephew, Napoleon III.</p>
      <p>His family has kept them since, said auctioneers Binoche &amp; Giquello.</p>
      <p>General Bertrand returned to France after the death of his beloved leader in 1821. Many French people still suspect Napoleon was poisoned by his British jailors.<br/> </p>
