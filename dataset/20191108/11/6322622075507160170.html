      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): The ASEAN Chamber of Commerce (ACC) today inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Foshan Chamber of Commerce of Importers and Exporters to attract Chinese investors, particularly from the prefecture, to invest in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>ACC president Datuk Moehamad Izat Emir said through the MoU, Chinese investors can explore the tremendous business opportunities in Malaysia for their export market, as well as for the local (Chinese) consumption.</p>
      <p>"We want to take advantage of (Chinese) investments pulling out due to the trade war with the United States, which generally benefits the more than 600 million ASEAN population.</p>
      <p>"It will also help enhance our products such as textiles, crude oil, oil palm, sugar, coffee, and rice through the research and development or innovations of these potential foreign investors," he told Bernama after the signing ceremony.</p>
      <p>The MoU was signed in conjunction with the Malaysia-China Trade Expo (MCTE) at the Putra World Trade Centre here today.</p>
      <p>During the event, being held over three days from Nov 7, the ACC also signed MoUs with MCTE and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Industry to enhance cooperation between them, as well as for a strategic marketing partnership.</p>
