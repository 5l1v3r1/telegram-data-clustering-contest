      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> have dominated the domestic scene over the last couple of years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s side were <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> runners-up last season, won the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Champions-League">Champions League</a> and reached the final the season before. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pep_Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a>‘s team completed an unprecedented league, League Cup and FA Cup treble last term and won the league with a record 100 points in 2017/18.</p>
      <p>This season, they are once again the top two already – though it’s the Reds who go into this weekend’s crunch fixture with a six-point lead, and who are unbeaten so far this season.</p>
      <p>The two squads are packed with talent, but if forced to decide on just 11 players to fill a team, who would get the nod between Liverpool and Man City’s stars?</p>
      <p>We’ve selected our side, which you can see in the gallery below, choosing from only those who are fit and available for this weekend’s game, in a 4-3-3 which both teams usually play.</p>
