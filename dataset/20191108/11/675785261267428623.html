      <h1>Conor McGregor 'cleared of fathering love child' following DNA test</h1>
      <h2>Terri Murray claimed she slept with UFC superstar Conor McGregor but he has continually denied the allegations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:49:29+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor is not the father of a Liverpool woman's child, it has been reported.</p>
      <p>Mum Terri Murray claims that her daughter Clodagh was born nine months after she allegedly slept with the UFC star, 30, after a night out in the city.</p>
      <p>She filed an “initial enquiry form” for child maintenance in 2018, naming McGregor as the “respondent”.</p>
      <p>The Irishman has continually denied he was the father and said he was willing to take a DNA test to prove it.</p>
      <p>The Irish Herald has today claimed that he has passed the test with a  'zero percent chance' he is Clodagh's father according to <a href="https://www.herald.ie/news/mcgregor-not-the-father-of-grand-national-love-child-dna-confirms-38672358.html">documents the newspaper have seen.</a></p>

      <p>The Herald claim swabs were taken from the Irish UFC star and the little girl for the DNA test</p>
      <p>The tests, obtained by McGregor's solicitors Michael J Staines and Company, reportedly stated there was a 'zero percent chance' that he fathered the child, who will turn two in January.</p>
      <p>The samples were said to have been tested by a private laboratory company.</p>
      <p>They are alleged to have not shown the biological markers that would need to be present if McGregor was the father.</p>

      <p>McGregor met partner Dee Devlin when he was a teenager with the couple having two children together.</p>
      <p>Their son Conor Jr. was born in 2017 and they announced the arrival of daughter Croia earlier this year.</p>
      <p>McGregor made his MMA debut in 2007 and has since shot to stardom.</p>
