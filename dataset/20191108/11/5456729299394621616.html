      <p>Armed soldiers on Friday morning invaded the Jakande market in Ketu, Lagos State, chasing away traders.</p>
      <p>One person was allegedly killed in the violence that ensued as touts, in retaliation, took to the streets, destroying property. The death is yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>However, a PREMIUM TIMES reporter witnessed as a person hit on the face by a stray bullet was rushed to the hospital.</p>
      <p>The thugs also went to the police station in the area, destroying cars packed there. They also vandalised BRT buses in the area.</p>
      <p>Many traders were seen taking refuge at a filling station close to the market.</p>
      <p>The cause of the invasion by the soldiers and the violence was yet to be ascertained at the time of this report.</p>
      <p>A police team at the scene later shot sporadically into the air to disperse the thugs.</p>
