      <p>HASHTRUD, Iran - At least five people have been killed and 330 others injured after a 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck northwestern Iran on Friday, Iranian state-run Press TV reported.</p>

      <p>The tremor struck at around 2:00 a.m. local time (5:30 p.m ET Thursday) in Iran's East Azerbaijan Province and there have been more than 50 aftershocks, Press TV said. It added that buildings in the area have been destroyed.</p>
      <p>The quake had a shallow depth of only 8 kilometers (almost 5 miles) according to the University of Tehran Seismological Center, as cited by Iranian state media.</p>
