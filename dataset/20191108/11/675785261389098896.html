      <p>A wife and her lover who shared twisted fantasies of having sex in her multi-millionaire husband's blood have been jailed for 21 years for murdering him.</p>
      <p>Angela Taylor, 53, and Paul Cannon, 54, killed wealthy farmer William Taylor, fuelled by a "venomous hatred" of him and his refusal to grant his wife of 20 years a divorce.</p>
      <p>For months, the couple had secretly revelled in violently pornographic fantasies of torturing and maiming the landowner, who vanished just days before his 70th birthday last June.</p>
      <p>Passing sentence at a packed St Albans Crown Court on Friday at the end of a two-month trial, judge Michael Kay QC said: "Only Paul Cannon and Angela Taylor and perhaps an unknown accomplice know what happened that night.</p>
      <p>"The evidence suggests that having been lured out of his house, William Taylor was attacked in the farmyard and killed there by means of strangulation or suffocation.</p>

      <p>"(William Taylor) loved Angela Taylor to the end despite whatever she did to him and however much she did not deserve that love."</p>
      <p>He said the "primary reason" for the killing "may be simply the extent to which Angela Taylor in particular loathed the very sight of William Taylor and felt she could never be rid of him."</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor's skeletal remains were found waist-deep in mud on a secluded riverbank near one of his farms in Gosmore, Hertfordshire, in February - eight months after he was last seen alive.</p>
      <p>The jury of eight women and four men convicted Taylor and digger driver Cannon on Monday after little more than 11 hours of deliberations. Despite a lack of forensic evidence, jurors found them guilty after hearing evidence of lurid WhatsApp messages, which included fantasies of showering together as Mr Taylor's blood ran down the drain and cutting his ligaments and fingers off.</p>

      <p>The pair had exchanged 28,000 messages between February and June last year, believing they were safe and could not be accessed.</p>
      <p>But they were later found by police on the memory of Cannon's phone despite being deleted by the farm labourer.</p>
      <p>St Albans Crown <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/court-case">Court</a> heard Cannon wrote on WhatsApp: "You know what I'd like to do ... make love to you on his kitchen table ... with him tied to a chair so he had to watch!!!!!!! Then send him to hell."</p>
      <p>Taylor replied: "Think that would kill him, last thing he saw was us making love."</p>
      <p>A message from Cannon said he planned to "torture the c****... nail their feet to the scaffolding", though it was not specified who this was about.</p>

      <p>Taylor said the hundreds of texts were "rubbish chat" used to vent about people in her and Cannon's lives.</p>
      <p>Jurors were also told of a message sent by Taylor where she said she wanted to "get shot" of Mr Taylor.</p>
      <p>She told the court: "It was just a phrase you say when you want to get someone out of your life, I don't mean actually shooting someone."</p>
      <p>In other messages heard in court, Cannon said he would "sort out Bill first, frighten the life out of him" weeks before his disappearance.</p>
      <p>"Good," Taylor replied at the time.</p>
