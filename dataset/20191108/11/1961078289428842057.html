      <p>Nixon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1956/09/23/archives/nixon-foresees-4day-work-week-says-gop-policies-assure-fuller-life.html?module=inline">predicted</a> it. Workers have <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/06/04/four-day-workweek-marketplace-edison-poll/">asked for it</a>. And businesses and governments have experimented with it for decades. The world has been talking about the four-day workweek for half a century, so what’s taking so long?</p>
      <p>The idea pops up every so often in expectant headlines. Just last week, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/11/05/business/microsoft-japan-says-four-day-workweek-boosted-productivity-40/">Microsoft Japan inspired a flood of stories</a> after reporting that, in a trial, shortened weeks had boosted productivity by about 40 percent. Yet the four-day workweek is the flying car of labor: a profound advancement that has seemed just around the corner for decades.</p>
      <p>“In America? I’m not expecting it anytime soon,” said Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, who <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/2-davos-experts-says-it-s-time-to-switch-to-a-four-day-working-week/">made the case</a> for a shorter workweek to business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The reasons that a four-day workweek hasn’t yet taken hold are varied, Mr. Grant and others argue. Some barriers are institutional and some are cultural. And then there’s the most human reason of all: inertia.</p>
      <h3>‘We value work as an end in itself’</h3>
      <p>The roots of the modern five-day workweek in the United States stretch back more than a century. In what is often cited as the first known example, a New England mill expanded the one-day weekend in 1908 from Sunday <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ssd?id=uc1.$b94466;seq=33">to accommodate Jewish workers</a> who observed the Saturday Sabbath. Less than two decades later, Henry Ford <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1926/09/26/archives/ford-establishes-a-5day-week-after-test-expects-spur-to-labor-will.html?searchResultPosition=43&amp;module=inline">followed suit</a>, instituting a five-day workweek throughout his company and popularizing the idea.</p>
      <p>The change reflected a broader trend, said Benjamin Kline Hunnicutt, a professor at the University of Iowa who studies work and leisure and wrote the 2014 book “Free Time: The Forgotten American Dream.”</p>
      <p>Working hours had been steadily reducing across the industrial world in what was seen as the fulfillment of the promise of technological advancement and capitalism, he said. Just a few years after Ford implemented the five-day workweek, the famed economist John Maynard Keynes <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.89977/page/n387">predicted that the trend would continue</a>, imagining that, by 2030 or so, people would work just 15 hours a week.</p>
      <p>But the decline in working hours soon stopped. The workweek stabilized at 40 hours and, after World War II, labor grew increasingly revered, according to Mr. Hunnicutt.</p>
      <p>“We value work more than any other culture in the history of the world,” he said. “We value work as an end in itself.”</p>
      <p>At the same time, consumerism was on the rise: Americans were increasingly choosing luxuries over leisure and the only way to get more luxuries was to work more.</p>
      <h3>‘What we have right now are a bunch of examples’</h3>
      <p>Today, employers are often unwilling to experiment with the four-day workweek, a reluctance that Mr. Grant attributes to a lack of three things: interest, faith in employees and understanding of the benefits that a shortened week can offer.</p>
      <p>Still, executives could be convinced, he said, with more rigorous study: “I would love to see better data and more data. What we have right now are a bunch of examples.”</p>
      <p>Those examples can be inconsistent. In some cases, the typical 40-hour workweek is merely redistributed over four days. In others, a day of the week is simply removed, resulting in fewer hours worked. Sometimes pay is cut, sometimes it remains the same.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, results have been mixed, especially among governments that have toyed with the idea.</p>
      <p>In 2008, Utah switched most state employees to a workweek that consisted of four 10-hour days. An audit conducted before the state ended the practice in 2011 found that <a href="https://digitallibrary.utah.gov/awweb/awarchive?item=33089">there wasn’t enough objective data to judge the effects</a> on productivity, though anecdotal evidence was mixed. In Sweden, a two-year experiment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/business/sweden-work-employment-productivity-happiness.html?module=inline">found that</a> nurses who worked 30-hour weeks spread over five days were happier and healthier than counterparts who worked a typical 40-hour week, though it came at a cost as new workers had to be hired.</p>
      <p>Corporate experiments, on the other hand, have yielded clearer — and often more positive — results.</p>
      <p>Last year, for example, a New Zealand estate planning advisory firm with about 240 employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/asia/four-day-workweek-new-zealand.html?module=inline">earned headlines</a> around the world after finding that a trial four-day week had boosted performance. The two-month experiment was so successful that the business, Perpetual Guardian, made the change permanent.</p>
      <p>“You’re not just getting the same productivity, you’re getting higher productivity,” the company’s owner, Andrew Barnes, said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Barnes was so convinced by the lessons of the experiment that he and a colleague, Charlotte Lockhart, <a href="https://4dayweek.com/">launched a nonprofit</a> this year to encourage businesses around the world to adopt a shorter week.</p>
      <h3>‘Work is changing’</h3>
      <p>Elusive as it may seem, there may still be hope for the four-day workweek.</p>
      <p>Historically, experiments with the idea have tended to focus on its effects on employee happiness and work-life balance. But the Perpetual Guardian trial last year and the test conducted by Microsoft Japan this year focused on a benefit that might motivate employers: productivity.</p>
      <p>“It is making it safer for chief executives, for boards, for companies around the world to say, ‘Well, actually, I’m not just doing this because it is a good thing for my employees, I can also do this because it is good for business,’” Mr. Barnes said.</p>
      <p>At the same time, there’s a widespread desire among employees to work shorter weeks.</p>
      <p>About two-thirds of workers favor a compressed workweek, according to recent surveys by the <a href="http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2018-10-25-Employers-And-Workers-Not-In-Sync-On-Popular-Office-Perks">staffing firm Robert Half</a> and the <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/06/04/four-day-workweek-marketplace-edison-poll/">public radio program Marketplace</a>. And <a href="https://www.kronos.com/about-us/case-for-4-day-workweek-nearly-half-employees-worldwide-could-do-their-jobs-in-5-hours-or-less-each-day">a poll conducted last year</a> by The Workforce Institute, a think tank at Kronos, a maker of work force management software, found that 34 percent of global workers wanted a four-day workweek compared to 28 percent who were happy with a five-day one. (Some unions <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/13/20862246/future-of-work-4-day-workweek">have pushed</a> for shorter weeks, too.)</p>
      <p>Millennials and the generation that follows, Generation Z, also seem to be driving a broad shift in priorities when it comes to work, focusing less on pay and more on balance, Mr. Hunnicutt argued.</p>
      <p>“My generation, the baby boomers, may be the last true believers in this really bizarre belief that work can really answer all of our questions as human beings,” he said.</p>
