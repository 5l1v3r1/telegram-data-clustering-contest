      <p>When an “irate” Georgia man reportedly used a racial slur during an alleged fight with two Black men at a Waffle House, he ended up shot and killed and the other men charged in his death.</p>
      <p>Robert Lewis Henderson Jr. and Antonio DeMarty Evans turned themselves in to the Butts County Sheriff’s Office Wednesday at about 9 a.m., according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.</p>
      <p>Henderson was charged with murder and aggravated assault in the death of Nicholas Bryan, and Evans was charged with tampering with evidence, the GBI said in its news <a href="https://gbi.georgia.gov/press-releases/2019-11-06/update-gbi-investigates-shooting-death-jackson-ga">release</a>.</p>

          <b>Georgia Man Directs Racial Slurs at 2 Male Customers In Waffle House, Engages in a Fight and Ends Up Shot Dead</b>

      <p>The incident that led to the arrests unfolded late on Halloween at the Waffle House on Ga. 36 in Butts County, which is about 50 miles southeast of Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Bryan, 27, was directing racial slurs at Henderson Jr., 36, and Evans, 39, when Waffle House staff members asked him to leave, according to another GBI news release.</p>
      <p>Instead of leaving, Bryan got into “a physical altercation” with Evans, and Henderson fired one round at Bryan, hitting him, the GBI said.</p>
      <p>The incident led to three separate calls within minutes of each other just before 11 p.m. about “disturbances” at the restaurant, according to the GBI.</p>
      <p>The first call was about an “irate customer,” the second about a fight and the third about shots fired, the GBI said.</p>
      <p>When deputies arrived at the restaurant, they found Bryan with a gunshot wound, authorities said.</p>
