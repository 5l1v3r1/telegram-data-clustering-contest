      <h1>Former LAPD chief Charlie Beck to be interim head of Chicago force: reports</h1>

      <p>A retired <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> police chief is expected to be named Friday as interim leader of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/chicagos-crime-wave">Chicago’s force</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Charlie Beck, 66, who left the LAPD in June 2018 after more than 40 years <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">with the department</a>, will replace Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who on Thursday announced he will step down at year’s end after three years as the city’s top cop.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Johnson, 60, a Chicago native, has been with the city’s force for more than 30 years.</p>
      <p>Beck will spend time shadowing Johnson during a transition period, and then lead the Chicago department until Mayor Lori Lightfoot names a permanent chief, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-police-superintendent-charlie-beck-20191108-e2aym7yoyzcbdc6egxrazp6pji-story.html">the Chicago Tribune reported</a>.</p>

      <p>In Los Angeles, Beck served under William Bratton, a former police commissioner in New York City who received credit for a dramatic reduction in Big Apple crime before moving on to California.</p>
      <p>Beck’s time on the LAPD coincided with major tests for law enforcement, such as the 1992 riots sparked by the acquittal of L.A. officers linked to the Rodney King beating case.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s decision to step down came as he faces an internal investigation, after being found sleeping in his car Oct. 17. The mayor later <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2019/11/6/20952358/charlie-beck-leading-candidate-interim-police-supt-chicago">told the Chicago Sun-Times</a> that Johnson had had “a couple of drinks” with dinner that evening.</p>

      <p>His appointment to the top job by former Mayor Rahm Emmanuel came wrapped in controversy because Johnson was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/chicago-mayor-emanuel-rejects-finalists-for-police-chief-will-make-own-pick">not one of the three candidates</a> recommended for the position by the Chicago Police Board, and Johnson hadn’t even applied for the job.</p>

      <p>At the time, Emmanuel was dealing with fallout from the release of video footage that showed a white police officer shooting an unarmed black teenager 16 times, killing him. Officer Jason Van Dyke <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/jason-van-dyke-trial-chicago-cop-found-guilty-of-second-degree-murder-of-laquan-mcdonald">was convicted of second-degree murder</a> in October 2018 in the death of Laquan McDonald.</p>
      <p>Lightfoot, who succeeded Emmanuel as mayor in May, is a former president of the city’s police board.</p>
