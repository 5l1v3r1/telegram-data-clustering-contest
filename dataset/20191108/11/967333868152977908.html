      <p>The frontman of The Libertines was arrested in Paris late on Thursday carrying 2 grammes of cocaine, Le Point reported, citing French police. According to the magazine, officers rounded him up in the Pigalle district, and the rock star refused to comply.</p>
      <p>The sources, however, told the outlet that the British <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201810221069114106-anthony-kiedis-removed-from-nba-game/">rock star was not violent or dangerous,</a> so he subsequently followed them, as passersby, who recognised Doherty allegedly filmed the incident.</p>
