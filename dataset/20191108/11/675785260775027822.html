      <h1>Liverpool fans urge Sadio Mane to do special celebration if he scores against Man City</h1>
      <h2>The Senegalese forward has been in the news in the build-up to the game, as City boss Pep Guardiola accused him of diving before later backtracking on his comments</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:35:55+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>The build-up to the titanic tussle between Liverpool and Manchester City on Sunday seems to have been all about one man.</p>
      <p>Or rather two.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's "diving" comments about Sadio Mane shortly after his side's 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> last weekend have been everywhere in the run-up to the Anfield meeting.</p>
      <p>The City boss was discussing the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> forward shortly after he'd been told that Mane had just scored a last-gasp winner for the Reds at Aston Villa, and so he was perhaps understandably frustrated.</p>
      <p>Mane seems to have taken it all in his stride though, even joking that he would be more than ready to dive if it helped his team win.</p>

      <p>“If it could be a penalty for sure I will ‘dive’ again,” he joked after the Reds' 2-1 Champions League win over Genk in midweek.</p>
      <p>“If the dive will give me a penalty then I will do it to get it back. Why not?</p>
      <p>“It’s a bit clever from him (Guardiola) to get the attention of the referee but I will just play my football.</p>

      <p>“I don’t pay attention to what he’s saying because it’s part of football.</p>
      <p>“Even though I saw him commenting about it, what he said, for me, I think it’s positive."</p>
      <p>And it seems that there are plenty of Liverpool fans online who are hoping to see a Mane dive at the weekend, but a dive that comes after a goal rather than a dive that will help score one.</p>

      <p>That's because the whole Guardiola-Mane 'row' has evoked memories of a similar one between then <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> manager David Moyes and then Liverpool forward Luis Suarez before a Merseyside derby in October 2012.</p>
      <p>Moyes had claimed that Suarez "often went down too easily" in the run-up to the game at Goodison Park, and so when Suarez's cross-shot was turned into his own net by Everton's Leighton Baines 14 minutes into the match, the Uruguayan tore off and launched into a comedy dive right in front of where Moyes was standing.</p>

      <p>It was a moment Reds fans loved, and many of them hope to see something similar from Mane in front of Guardiola on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Suarez later scored again in that 2012 clash, but Everton battled back to a earn a 2-2 draw from a thrilling Merseyside derby.</p>
      <p>With many expecting a similarly thrilling game at Anfield on Sunday, will Mane 'do a Suarez?'</p>
