      <h1>The Undertaker tipped for WWE Survivor Series as local appearance is confirmed</h1>
      <h2>WWE legend the Undertaker is set to be in Illinois for a meet-and-greet, 24 hours ahead of the pay-per-view</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:32:57+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>The Undertaker could be set to feature at Survivor Series later this month.</p>
      <p>The WWE legend has made rare appearances at pay-per-views in recent times.</p>
      <p>He was recently pictured in Saudi Arabia with WWE chief Vince McMahon but did not take part in the Crown Jewel event.</p>
      <p>But he could well feature at Survivor Series after it was confirmed he will be in Illinois on the same weekend.</p>
      <p>The pay-per-view is set to take place on November 24 at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.</p>
      <p>And the Undertaker could well be involved after a local memorabilia store announced he will be hosting a meet and greet 24 hours earlier.</p>

      <p>Chicago store Fiterman Sports Group announced the WWE legend would be signing autographs on Saturday November 23 at the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center.</p>
      <p>Given there is little over two miles between the two locations, there is real speculation the Undertaker will feature at Survivor Series</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> is set to make another appearance at WWE SmackDown in Manchester this weekend.</p>
      <p>Boxing legend Fury made a successful wrestling debut when he knocked out Braun Strowman in Saudi Arabia last Thursday.</p>
      <p>Fury only signed up to the organisation last month as he promotes his rematch with  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a>  which is scheduled for next February.</p>
      <p>His involvement at SmackDown has been confirmed although it is unclear if he will feature in any more fights.</p>
