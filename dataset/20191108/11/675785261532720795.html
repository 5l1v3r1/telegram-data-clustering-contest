      <h2>Hurtigruten's new cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen made history this week as its naming ceremony took place in Antarctica where it will sail for a host of itineraries</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:29:25+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>Hurtigruten's new cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen has become the first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cruise-ships">cruise ship</a> in history to be named in Antarctica.</p>
      <p>It was a fitting setting, not only because the ship will offer itineraries across the Antarctic, but also because it was named after iconic polar explorer Roald Amundsen who led the first expeditions to the likes of the Northern Passage, the South Pole, and the first proven expedition to have reached the North Pole.</p>
      <p>The ceremony took place in Chiriguano Bay on Brabant Island - and instead of a traditional champagne bottle, godmother Karin Strand opted for a chunk of ice.</p>
      <p>In fact, she used the words of Roald Amundsen for the big occasion: "It is not my intention to dishonor the glorious grape, but already now you shall get the taste of your real environment.</p>
      <p>"For the ice you have been built, in the ice you shall stay most of your life, and in the ice, you shall solve your tasks."</p>

      <p>To mark the occasion, Karin also asked for the traditional godmother gift to be replaced by a donation to Hurtigruten Foundation, a foundation specially set up to contribute to areas Hurtigruten explores.</p>
      <p>There's no denying that the hybrid-powered ship will be offering quite the adventures for passengers.</p>

      <p>Boasting a gross tonnage of 20,889 and a length of 140m, the ship will have heaps of glamorous features including a fully equipped Science Center, observation decks, infinity pool, panoramic sauna, wellness center, three restaurants, bars, and an Explorer Lounge.</p>
      <p>The ship can hold up to 530 guests - 500 for sailings to Antarctica - while over 50 per cent of its cabins boast private balconies.</p>

      <p>As for the itineraries? We're talking itineraries across Antarctica, Alaska and the Northwest Passage.</p>
      <p>The ship uses large battery packs to support her low-emission engines, which Hurtigruten says will reduce her CO2 emissions by more than 20 per cent compared to other cruise ships of the same size.</p>
