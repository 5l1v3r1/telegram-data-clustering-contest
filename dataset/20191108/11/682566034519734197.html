      <p>Cape Town - <b>Kaizer Chiefs </b>forward <b>Khama Billiat</b> has dismissed the idea that he and <b>Orlando Pirates</b> winger <b>Thembinkosi Lorch</b> have a beef following their confrontation last weekend.</p>
      <p>The Telkom Knockout clash between the Soweto giants reached boiling point last week when Lorch appeared to stamp on Billiat sparking a massive altercation between both sets of players.</p>
      <p>Lorch only received a yellow card when a red was more appropriate but Billiat said he and his teammates have already forgotten about the incident ahead of Saturday's encounter at the FNB Stadium.</p>
      <p>Billiat told reporters: "We don't have any beef. It happens in big games where emotions run high and things are done in the heat of the moment.</p>
      <p>"I know this because I also do some crazy stuff at times.</p>
      <p>"We are cool, we spoke about it after the game. I don't think his actions were deliberate.</p>
      <p>"Orlando Pirates are a big team with quality players, I don't think they will target me."</p>
      <p>Billiat is expected to make his return to Amakhosi's starting eleven after missing the midweek match against Chippa United.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 15:30.</p>
