      <h1>'I agree' - Ex-Aston Villa man weighs in on Jack Grealish decision</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Jack Grealish was left out of the England squad for the next batch of upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers later this month in a surprise decision</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:44:18+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Darren Bent says Jack Grealish is unlucky not to be named in the England squad for upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Eyebrows were raised yesterday when the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> captain was left out of Gareth Southgate's side for clashes with Montenegro and Kosovo later this month.</p>
      <p>Southgate explained that <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Grealish</a> was competing with wingers because <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> has played him out wide this season, with Leicester City's James Maddison and Chelsea's Mason Mount ahead of him in the pecking order of attacking midfielders.</p>
      <p>Grealish has missed the past couple of games because of a calf injury, but Smith confirmed he would be OK to play for England if he was called up.</p>

      <p>Villa fans and neutrals <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jack-grealish-england-aston-villa-17218289">were expecting him to make the cut for the 27-man squad</a> after two goals and one assist in his last three matches.</p>
      <p>And former Villa striker Bent has weighed in with his thoughts.</p>
      <p>"Immediately the one that jumps out if the Grealish one, because I think he's playing really well at the minute," he told talkSPORT.</p>
      <p>"But I also agree with what Gareth is saying in that in the first time in a long time we've got that creative midfield role stacked with talent.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"We've got so many young players who are playing really well in the minute.</p>
      <p>"We've got some who are not even playing that consistently, like Phil Foden, who can come in and slot into that role.</p>
      <p>"As much as I think it's harsh on Grealish, he's up against some stiff coimpetition."</p>
