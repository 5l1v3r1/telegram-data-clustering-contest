      <h1>Pixel phones can now vibrate before ramping up the volume</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:25:45+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/david-oh/" target="_blank">David Oh</a></address>
      <p>Starting this month, Pixel owners will gain an additional sound option that controls how their phones behave when a call comes in. Awkwardly referred by Google as the ramping ringer feature, it lets the phone vibrate for a few seconds first before the ringtone volume goes up in an increasingly louder fashion.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-android-q-rules-ramping-ringer-now-playing-album-art/">Spotted by XDA during an APK teardown</a> during the summer, the ramping ringer feature was expected to be part of the Pixel 4 launch in October. Just as the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/05/how-to-enables-rules-on-android-10-with-root/">new Rules feature eventually became available</a> to various Pixel phones about a month later, so it is with the ramping ringer, with many reports coming in from OG Pixel, Pixel 2, Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, and Pixel 4 owners.</p>

      <p>The new feature is found inÂ <b>Settings </b>&gt;<b> Sounds </b>&gt;<b> Vibrate for calls</b>. With the "Vibrate first then ring gradually" option selected, the phone will begin responding to calls by vibrating for about five seconds before gradually increasing the ringtone volume over a period of 10 seconds. The loudness level of the ringtone as it goes up will not exceed the max ring volume limit set by the user.</p>
