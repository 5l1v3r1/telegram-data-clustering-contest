      <p>All Marines now have the right to bear umbrellas, for the first time in their more than <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/10/us/marina-hierl-marine-infantry-platoon-trnd/index.html">200-year history</a> .</p>
      <p>Prior to the recent updates in uniform regulations, women in the Marines were allowed to use umbrellas, but the men were not. That rule changes now.</p>
      <p>Umbrellas were not allowed in part due to their hindrance in saluting. The rule for women stipulated that umbrellas -- which had to be all-black -- must be carried in the left hand "so that the hand salute can be properly rendered," the <a href="https://www.marines.mil/Portals/1/Publications/MCO%201020.34H%20v2.pdf?ver=2018-06-26-094038-137">regulations state</a> .</p>
      <p>That part isn't changing. The small umbrellas will still have to be all black and carried in their left hand to allow for a proper salute.</p>
      <p>Marines carrying umbrellas has been a scarce sight.</p>
      <p>In 2013, two held umbrellas above then-President Barack Obama and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's prime minister, as storm clouds unleashed a shower of rain on the two leaders.</p>
      <p>Speaking to CNN at the time of the incident, Marine Corps spokesman Capt. Greg Wolf <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/16/marines-holding-umbrellas-extremely-rare/comment-page-1/">called the incident</a> "extremely rare," only happening because the President needed it.</p>
      <p>The umbrella rule isn't the only one that's changing. The Marines will also now allow women to wear silver stud earrings.</p>
