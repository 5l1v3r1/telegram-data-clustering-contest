      <p>Thousands of Twitter users had expressed their displeasure on the popular quiz show’s decision to refer Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as just Shivaji in one of the questions on the show while addressing Mughal ruler Aurangzeb as ’emperor.’ The controversial question had read, “Which of these rulers was the contemporary of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb?” The options were Maharana Pratap, Rana Sanga, Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Shivaji.</p>
      <p>Furious users took to Twitter demanding a boycott of Sony TV.</p>
