      <p>Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about today:</p>
      <p>1. WHAT TRUMP WANTED TO HEAR</p>
      <p>Three words from the Ukraine president: investigations, Biden, Clinton. That's according to the transcript of an impeachment inquiry interview with career State Department official George Kent.</p>
      <p>2. HOW IVANKA TRUMP VIEWS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY</p>
      <p>Much like her father, telling the AP in Morocco that the House Democratic probe is about "overturning the results of the 2016 election." But she seems to part ways with the president on the relevance of the whistleblower's identity.</p>
      <p>3. FOR SYRIANS IN THE EAST, IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN OIL</p>
      <p>As U.S. troops beef up their presence to protect oil fields in the eastern part of the country, residents hope their mission will also bring stability and prosperity to the region - and keep Damascus out.</p>
      <p>4. TWITTER ACCOUNTS IN TURKEY PUSHED PROPAGANDA</p>
      <p>As Turkish forces invaded northern Syria to launch an assault, social media accounts used old or inaccurate photos of soldiers to tell a different story.</p>
      <p>5. BIG TECH FIGHTING MISINFORMATION AHEAD OF UK VOTE</p>
      <p>Experts believe British voters remain vulnerable to the same type of misleading ads and phony claims that played a role in the vote to leave the European Union three years ago.</p>
      <p>6. 'I DO NOT FEEL SAFE HERE'</p>
      <p>After holding funerals for and burying some of the nine American women and children slain in a cartel ambush, residents of the tiny Mexican town of La Mora remain fearful.</p>
      <p>7. TRUMP TO CHASE BLACK VOTE</p>
      <p>The president's reelection campaign is launching a new "Black Voices for Trump" outreach initiative, an effort being met with skepticism, given his dismal approval rating with the demographic.</p>
      <p>8. A SAD DAY IN PARADISE</p>
      <p>The Northern California town mostly destroyed by a wildfire is marking the anniversary of the blaze with 85 seconds of silence to honor the victims who were killed.</p>
      <p>9. PLACIDO DOMINGO BOWS OUT OF PRE-OLYMPIC EVENTS</p>
      <p>The Tokyo Olympics organizing committee says the opera legend has said he won't perform at pre-Olympics cultural events in Japan following sexual harassment allegations against him.</p>
      <p>10. RAIDERS RALLY PAST CHARGERS</p>
      <p>Josh Jacobs scores on an 18-yard run with 1:02 remaining and Oakland has a late winning touchdown drive for the second time in five weeks, beating Los Angeles 26-24.</p>
