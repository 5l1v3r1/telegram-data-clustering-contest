      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - NATO needs to grow and change or else the alliance runs the risk of becoming obsolete, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday.</p>
      <p>“Seventy years on NATO now, it needs to grow and change. It needs to confront the realities of today and the challenges of today,” Pompeo said during a question and answer session after giving a speech in Berlin.</p>
      <p>“If nations believe that they can get the security benefit without providing NATO the resources that it needs, if they don’t live up to their commitments, there is a risk that NATO could become ineffective or obsolete,” he added.</p>
