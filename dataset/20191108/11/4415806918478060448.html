      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is certain Mason Greenwood will have “a very big career” at Manchester United – just as the manager is sure about the long-term benefits of taking the teenager out of the limelight at times.</p>
      <p>Having got a taste of first-team football last season, the 18-year-old set tongues wagging during pre-season with some fine goals and promising displays that led to effusive praise from the United boss.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer went onto describe Greenwood as one of the best finishers he has ever seen on the eve of his first senior goal against Astana – a superb September strike followed by another against Rochdale the following week.</p>

      <p>The teenager had to wait until Thursday to add to that haul, showing composure and skill to put United on course for a comprehensive 3-0 win against Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>That was Greenwood’s first start in five weeks – a period in which he dropped down to play for the Under-21s in the EFL Trophy – as Solskjaer focuses on developing the teenage talent correctly.</p>
      <p>“Mason is going to have a very big career, but sometimes is not the right time to play him,” the former United striker said.</p>
      <p>“He knows why he hasn’t played as much. We’re taking our time with him.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a difficult period. Anthony (Martial) has been away, to put all the weight on his shoulder wasn’t right either.</p>
      <p>“I think we are finding the right balance between playing him, resting him and training him. He needs to learn the man’s game.</p>
      <p>“He’s gone up from the Under-18s last year, now he’s training with the first team every day and you can’t just turn that switch on and off.</p>

      <p>“You’ve got to perform every day if you are going to be accepted by a group like this.”</p>
      <p>The last comment was striking as Greenwood has been given an elevated role due to the summer exits of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez to Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>Asked if he had not wanted to heap pressure on the teenager during Martial’s recent injury lay-off, Solskjaer said: “Not really.</p>
      <p>“If he’d really stamped his authority in training every single day and been the best option, he would have played every game, but as a young boy you expect ups and downs and he’s had some downs. But I think he is on his way up again.</p>
      <p>“You always get assessed on results now, but the DNA of this club – and it’s always been in our philosophy and my philosophy to give young players with the right attitude a chance and if that takes a couple of years for him to really, really come through, it’s worth it for us.</p>
      <p>“I’m managing for Man United, I’m not managing for me.</p>
      <p>“I am managing for the best way I think we can get the best out of Mason.”</p>

      <p>Solskjaer acknowledged a comparison between the finishing of Greenwood and former United striker Robin Van Persie, as well as nodding to a personality as adaptable as his footwork.</p>
      <p>“He is very composed as well with his finishing,” he said of Greenwood, who last month signed a new and improved contract until at least 2023.</p>
      <p>“It is just what he does it is natural to him. Right foot, left foot – I don’t think he still knows which is the best one, which is very difficult for defenders to defend against. He’s doing his finishing practices.</p>
      <p>“I can see it every day. The good thing is he can do it at Old Trafford in front of a full crowd or 62,000, he doesn’t get fazed by the occasion. He’s still composed.</p>
      <p>“Whether that’s a game with his mates in the park or a cup final he will still finish the same or Premier League, hopefully.”</p>

      <p>That positive, unruffled personality appears to have helped Greenwood shrug off being dropped to the Under-21s for the recent EFL Trophy match at Doncaster by scoring a late decider dedicated to his late grandmother.</p>
      <p>“He scored a winner in that game against Doncaster, which always gives players confidence,” Solskjaer said ahead of Sunday’s Premier League clash against Brighton.</p>
      <p>“That was more important for him to play that game and 90 minutes to be ready for these games instead of being on the bench the day after against Chelsea.”</p>
