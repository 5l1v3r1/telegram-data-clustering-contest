      <p>After a long absence from professional football, a former Chippa United coach is back in the PSL with a club in the GladAfrica Championship. </p>
      <p>Following the disappointing results for Richards Bay FC since the departure of their former coach Brandon Truter, who left to join Swallows FC, the KwaZulu-Natal club has appointed Ian Palmer as their new head coach. </p>

      <p>Truter surprisingly parted ways with the KZN club in September, although the team was in third place on the GladAfrica Championship log. </p>
      <p>Palmer is taking over from Thulani Nkosi and Jomo Ntuli, who have been co-coaches at the club.</p>

      <p>The former Orlando Pirates striker has been tasked with lifting the team from their current 8th place on the log to challenge for promotion to the Absa Premiership at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Palmer has previously also coached Maritzburg United and Black Leopards, among other clubs in the PSL.  </p>
      <p>Palmer confirmed to the Siya crew that he officially started his duties at Richards Bay yesterday (Thursday).   </p>
