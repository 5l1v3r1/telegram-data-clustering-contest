      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-vaccines">The Vaccines</a> frontman Justin Young and Timothy Lanham have launched a new side project, Halloweens.</p>
      <p>The band have shared two new tracks – ‘Hannah You’re Amazing’ and ‘Ur Kinda Man’ – which you can listen to below.</p>
      <p>They’ve also shared the video for ‘Hannah You’re Amazing’, which you can also view below.</p>

      <p>Young and Lanham decided to team up for the project – which was born out of their shared love of classic songwriting – after they wrote The Vaccines’ 2018 album ‘Combat Sports’ together.</p>
      <p>The pair wrote a series of tracks in Paris before they recorded an album in Oakland, California with Luke Temple, who has previously worked with Here We Go Magic and Adrianne Lenker.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Halloweens, Young said: “The record came from a period of writing without consequence or compromise where the only requisite was ‘do we love this?’. Being able to write and record a record that nobody expects is an incredibly empowering and exciting process, free from the fog of ambition or fear.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Young teamed up with <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/kylie-minogue">Kylie Minogue</a> for new song ‘Lazy’ for <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/er-kylie-vaccines-team-new-song-2523493">the soundtrack to the new Shaun The Sheep movie </a><i>Farmageddon.</i></p>
