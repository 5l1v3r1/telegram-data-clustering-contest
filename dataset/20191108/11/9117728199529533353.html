      <h1>Toto Wolff: Less mistakes on raceday "biggest key" to F1 world championship double</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> team principal Toto Wolff believes the "biggest key" to securing yet another Constructors' and Drivers' double was making less mistakes than their rivals on Sundays of race weekends.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> had the quicker car this season, especially in the second half of the campaign; meaning Scuderia were the dominant force on the Saturday, but often messed up their strategy during the Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, it was quite the opposite for Mercedes. The Silver Arrows still performed well in most qualifying sessions, but rarely made a mistake during the race on Sunday and this is something Wolff believes was key to securing another double.</p>

      <p><i>"Every championship seems like the hardest," </i>Wolff said to <i>Motorsport.com. "It may be because we are protected by our memory, but certainly this year had its ups and downs.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"We came out of the block very strong, didn't have the quickest package on Saturday for a long time, but we were able to make the least mistakes on Sunday. </i>
        <i>And that was probably the biggest key to making us win the championship.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Obviously, for me the highlight is Austin, we came back to old form, winning the title decider with Valtteri (Bottas, race-winner), and winning the championship with Lewis with strong pace is for me, the highlight of the season."</i>
