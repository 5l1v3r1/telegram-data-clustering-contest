      <h3>POLICE have taken custody of two suspects in the killing of 67-year old block-time radio broadcaster Dindo Generoso in Dumaguete City and are still tracking down a third man said to be the main gunman who killed the victim early morning Thursday.</h3>
      <p>Police Regional Office 7 director, Brigadier General Valeriano T. de Leon, requested that the identity and background of the gunman be kept secret until he is already arrested.</p>
      <p>A retired cop identified as Gleen Corsame and one Teddy Salaw were arrested by the local police just hours after Generoso was killed and are still undergoing questioning as of yesterday.</p>
      <p>Corsame has been tagged as the alleged driver of the motorcycle used in the killing while Salaw was described as the ‘spotter’ who pinpointed the victim to the gunman.</p>
      <p>The gunman was also reportedly seen riding the pick-up of Salaw which was last seen parked a few kilometers away from the site where the victim was shot dead.</p>
      <p>The suspect reportedly alighted from the vehicle and transferred to the motorbike before shooting the victim without any provocation.</p>
      <p>De Leon said they are looking into the possibility that the killing was’ job-related’ although other angles are also being pursued as of press time.</p>
      <p>The block-time radio announcer of Bai Radio suffered several gunshot wounds in the body and died on the spot during the attack in Barangay Piapi around 7:30 a.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>An initial investigation showed that the victim was driving his car along Hibbard Avenue in Bgy. Piapi when the suspects tailed him before the back-rider suddenly pulled out a handgun and shot the radioman repeatedly without any provocation.</p>
