      <p>Aventura Technologies and its operator have been charged with fraud after allegedly selling surveillance equipment to the US government with known security vulnerabilities. <br/><br/>Located in Commack, New York, the company, which sells products including vision cameras, CCTV, and storage services, is central to a criminal complaint unsealed on Thursday. </p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/aventura-technologies-inc-and-its-senior-management-charged-fraud-money-laundering-and">US Department of Justice</a> (DoJ), Aventura knowingly sold vulnerable equipment to both the government and private customers, and also falsely claimed that the products were made in the US -- when, in fact, products were manufactured and covertly imported from China. <br/><br/><b>See also: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/feds-arrest-alleged-members-of-international-atm-skimmer-ring/">Feds arrest alleged members of international ATM skimmer ring</a> <br/><br/>The alleged scheme has been in operation since 2006. Customers were lied to for over a decade, prosecutors claim, leading to the use of surveillance equipment by the military with "known cyber vulnerabilities" originating from China -- while the firm continued to pretend everything was made on Long Island.  </p>
      <p>Aventura and seven current and former employees are being charged by the DoJ. Prosecutors named Frances Cabasso, Aventura's "de facto" owner, wife of Jack Cabasso and CEO, executives Jonathan Lasker, Christine Lavonne Lazarus and Eduard Matulik, current employee Wayne Marino, and Alan Schwartz, a retired member of staff.  <br/><br/>In order to investigate the alleged wrongdoing, law enforcement intercepted and marked shipments making their way from China to Aventura's headquarters. One such product, a $13,500 laser-enhanced night vision camera ordered by the Navy, was traced from China to a shipping facility in Jamaica and then to Aventura, before being delivered to the Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, weeks later. </p>

All of the suspects are being charged with unlawful importation and conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud. <br/><br/>"With today's arrests, the defendants' brazen deceptions and fraud schemes have been exposed, and they will face serious consequences for slapping phony 'Made in the U.S.A.' labels on products that our armed forces and other sensitive government facilities depended upon,"  United States Attorney Richard Donoghue commented.    <br/><br/>ZDNet has reached out to Aventura Technologies but has not heard back at the time of publication.</p>
