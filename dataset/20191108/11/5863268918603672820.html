      <h1>Kartarpur corridor: Passports, registrations mandatory after India's objection over waiver</h1>

      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The requirements of passports and registrations have been restored by the authorities after New Delhi’s objection over waiver for Sikh pilgrims arriving in Pakistan from India through Kartarpur corridor, Dunya News reported on Friday.</p>
      <p>According to the diplomatic sources, it is not possible for Pakistan to not check the documents of the travelers if India examines the passports first. It has been learnt that the special relaxation, earlier given by Pakistan, cannot be implemented after India’s refusal.</p>
      <p>Both countries have started working on exchange of pilgrims’ lists. It is pertinent here to mention that Islamabad had waived off the clause of passports and registrations for one year in the wake of the 550th birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, foreign office spokesperson Dr Mohammad Faisal talked to Dunya News and told that the Indian travelers will arrive in Pakistan through Kartarpur corridor and Wagah border. Sikh community from other countries will also be able to attend the celebrations of Baba Guru Nanak’s birth anniversary on November 9, he added.</p>
      <p>Former prime minister of India Manmohan Singh, cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, Indian Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh will attend the ceremony among others. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will be the chief guest on the occasion. </p>
