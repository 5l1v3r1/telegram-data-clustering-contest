      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 8 – RIA Tomsk.</b> Siberian branch of State Museum and Exhibition Center ROSIZO will open exhibition of works of famous Lithuanian photo artist Romualdas Požerskis on Friday in Tomsk Center of Modern Art (TCMA); exhibition will include 50 black and white shots from three art cycles shot in the 1970s and 1980s, curator of the exhibition Irina Korneva reported RIA Tomsk.</p>
      <p>According to the exhibition, Požerskis has long been recognized as a classic of world photography. His works are regularly exhibited in different countries, some of the photographs are in the collections of museums in France, Finland, Sweden, the United States, Russia and other countries. He is a member of the International Federation of Photographic Art (FIAP). He is currently a professor at the Faculty of Arts of Kaunas Vytautas Magnus University.</p>
      <blockquote>"The exhibition will feature works from the series "Little Alfonsas’ Miseries and Joys", shot for 12 years, the hero of which is farmer Alphonse Mickus, whose height was only 90 centimeters. &lt;…&gt; Photos from the "Lithuanian Pilgrimages" cycle, shot in the 1970s and 1980s and capturing Catholic marches in Lithuania, and works from the "Restless Riders" cycle will also be featured", – Korneva said.</blockquote>
      <p>The history of Lithuania, recorded in the photo works of Požerskis, has long been banned. Thus, the cycle "Lithuanian Pilgrimages" was shot for almost 20 years and was first shown only in 1988, as the pictures show religious events, and the works themselves strongly reflect the extent to which people remain true to their traditions at any time, the curator of the exhibition says.</p>
      <p>The exhibition will feature 50 black and white works giving an exhaustive idea of the specifics of Lithuanian photography of the second half of the 20th century. The exhibition will be opened on Friday, November 8, in the Tomsk exhibition center of TCMA (Nahanovich Lane 3a).</p>
      <p>In addition, Požerskis will come to Tomsk with his daughter, fashion photographer Monica Požerskytė on November 17. He will give a public lecture "Secrets of Lithuanian Photography in the Second Half of the 20th Century" and will hold a master class for photographers of Tomsk. His daughter will also hold a master class for students of the <a href="http://en.tsu.ru/">Tomsk State University</a> (TSU) on the topic "Portrait photography without photoshop", the curator of the exhibition said.</p>
      <p>The exhibition was organized by the Center for European Photography of TSU with the support of the Lithuanian Culture Institute.</p>
      <p>Earlier it was reported that the Center for European Photography was opened at TSU at the end of 2018. One of its tasks – is to hold in Tomsk exhibitions of modern photography from different European countries and attract interested young audiences, future professionals of the media industry. In addition, the center holds various educational events in the field of new media, visual communication, documentary films and photography.</p>
