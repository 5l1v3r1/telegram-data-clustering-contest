      </h3>
      <p>Walter Hill’s masterly 1978 slice of neo-noir, taut and spare and set in a midnight-dark downtown LA, stars Ryan O’Neal as the (getaway) Driver, Bruce Dern as the Detective – and the one is after the other. The sparse, fractured dialogue adds existential tones to Hill’s revved-up thriller, which powers through a series of brilliantly executed, tyre-shrieking car chases.<br/><i>Saturday 9 November, 9.15pm, Talking Pictures TV</i></p>

Like a party-fuelled version of The X Factor, the show follows the group as they live together, record their first single and perform their first chaotic live shows, all under Charli’s benevolent gaze.<br/><i>From Friday 15 November, Netflix</i></p>
