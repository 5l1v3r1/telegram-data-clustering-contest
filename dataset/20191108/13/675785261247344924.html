      <h1>TikTok 'bright eye challenge' fakes teens using bleach to 'change eye colour'</h1>
      <h2>Clips of people claiming to alter their eye colour with substances including bleach and hand sanitiser remain live on TikTok despite the creator's admitting it was faked</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:29:43+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:29</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>Videos of a 'bright eye challenge' have been posted online appearing to show people attempting to change their eye colour using bags of bleach.</p>
      <p>The clips, which the creators have since admitted were faked, remain on TikTok, a video sharing app which allows users to share short clips of themselves taking part in skits.</p>
      <p>The challenge involves filling a plastic bag with hand sanitiser, bleach, shaving cream and jelly before holding it against your eye for 'about a minute', claiming it will alter eye colour.</p>
      <p>One of the original uploads shows the substances lined up next to a Ziploc bag and gives instructions on how to create the mixture, with the caption 'tell me you guys used to do this too?'.</p>

      <p>The concoction is then held against the person's face before being removed and appears to show the iris to have changed to a bright yellow colour in comparison to the other eye, which remains dark green.</p>
      <p>The user has since admitted in an interview that the clip was faked using video editing.</p>
      <p>The challenge has since been replicated with one girl falsely claiming to have achieved similar results, gaining more than 1,600 comments including 'does it hurt and does it go away?'.</p>
      <p>The user then later uploaded a second video to say the trick had been faked, telling TikTok user's not to put bleach near their eyes as she 'wouldn't want you guys hurting yourself'.</p>

      <p>Another teen also posted a recording of her taking part in the 'bright eye challenge' to her 90,000 followers after seeing the original and thinking 'it would be cool to make one too'.</p>
      <p>She later said she had in fact put in a single contact lens to change the colour of one of her eyes before using the editing tools on TikTok to make it look as though it had worked.</p>
      <p>Despite the admissions, videos of the challenge remain on TikTok, gaining thousands of views.</p>
      <p>Dr Susan Blakeney, Clinical Advisor at the Royal College of Optometrists, said any attempts to recreate it could lead to permanent damage of sight.</p>

      <p>“Don’t do it," said Dr Blakeney. "You can’t change the colour of eyes by pressing a bag against it.</p>
      <p>"It can cause corneal scarring and affect your sight. The cornea is the most sensitive part of the body - it’s the clear part that enables us to see clearly and anything that affects that can have a significant effect on your eyes and be extremely painful."</p>
      <p>As well as the dangers of the bag splitting and the harmful substances leaking out, Dr Blakeney said there would also be a chance of them splashing on the outside of the bag as they are transfered.</p>
      <p>She explained that aside from the risk the chemicals pose, simply pressing the bag against your eye can cause problems as it could be contaminated with dirty dust or grit particles which could scratch your eye and also cause extreme discomfort.</p>
      <p>A TikTok spokesperson said: "Promoting a safe environment on TikTok is our top priority and we take our responsibility to keep our community safe extremely seriously.</p>
      <p>"This challenge violates our guidelines which explain how we expect our platform to be used in a positive and safe way. While the user who created the challenge intended it to be a joke, to protect our community we have removed videos which violated our policies."</p>
