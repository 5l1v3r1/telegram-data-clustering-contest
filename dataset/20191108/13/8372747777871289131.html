      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. -- There's a new medical marijuana dispensary in Southwest Florida and it's the first in the area to have a special feature.</p>
      <p>Fox 4 got a sneak peek Friday at AltMed Florida's new "MÃœV" facility on Colonial Boulevard in Fort Myers, just west of State Road 82.</p>
      <p>The dispensary is designed to look like an Apple store, with a modern, open-concept.</p>
      <p>This is the company's second location to feature the drive-through, which they say makes the shopping experience easier for customers.</p>
      <p>The dispensary's grand opening is set for 10 a.m. on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ruskin-based AltMed Florida currently has nine other locations around the state.</p>
