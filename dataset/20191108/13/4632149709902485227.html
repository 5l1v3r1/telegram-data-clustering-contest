      <h1>Girmit movie review: Director Ravi Basrur needs all the applause for this special treat</h1>

      <p><i>No Child's Play<br/></i><br/>This is a unique attempt. A regular mass-masala entertainer with songs, fights, drama, romance and tearjerker moments. Except that all actors are pre-teens with voices of Sandalwood stars and actors including Yash, Radika Pandit, Rangayana Raghu, Sadhu Kokil and Achyuth. Something like how Hollywood animation films use voices of big stars. <br/><br/>So does it work? Surprisingly it does. The novelty of it does not wear off easily even as the entertainment of the dialogues and plot keeps pouring in. There is exactly the cliched plot you expect in a commercial potboiler. The same hero eulogising dialogues you find in any film, the angry villains and goofy sidekicks all form part of this canvas. <br/><br/><br/>The hero and heroine fall in love as usual. Now what is love without the typical cinematic hurdles. The hero's mother cannot get enough English lessons and wants a bride for her son who can speak it like the natives of the British islands. The heroine's family is not without providing its own share of problems to the love story. The heroine has two elder sisters who have to be married off first. There is also a rival who is planning a revenge. The stage is set for the roller-coaster family drama. <br/><br/>It is the novelty of hearing the voices of known actors from the mouths of kids that makes the film engaging. The youngsters have also performed quite well. Acting as adults seems to come naturally for them. <br/><br/><br/>As much as it is similar to formula films of Sandalwood, this is not a run-of-the-mill film. Ravi Basrur needs all the applause for this special treat. He is ably supported by his team that includes Sachin Suvarna's able handling of the cinematography. If there is a family entertainer out there, this is it.</p>
