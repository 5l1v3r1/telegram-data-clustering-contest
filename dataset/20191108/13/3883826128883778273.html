        <b>Nigel Farage has said the Brexit Party will try "for a few more days" to agree an electoral pact with the Tories.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Campaigning in south Wales, he said his party would beat Labour in "many constituencies" in the region if the Conservatives withdrew from the field.</p>
      <p>But he said Boris Johnson would have to abandon his deal with the EU, which was "not Brexit" but a "short term political fix" to win the election.</p>
      <p>He also challenged the prime minister to a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50347661">head-to-head debate</a> on the deal.</p>

      <p>The event took place on Friday in Little Mill near Pontypool, just over the border from the Labour-held constituency of Torfaen but located in the Tory-held constituency of Monmouth.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a village hall, Mr Farage had this message for Mr Johnson: "If you really believe that this is a great new deal, or as you said in the last couple of days a fantastic deal, if you are really trying to tell the British public this gets Brexit done, let's have a civilised head-to-head debate on what this EU treaty means and I'd be only be too happy to stand with Boris to talk this through."</p>
      <p>Last week, Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50264395">rejected suggestions</a> that he should work with the Brexit Party during the election.</p>
      <p>Plaid Cymru, Liberal Democrats and the Greens have agreed a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-50325815">pro-EU electoral pact</a> in 11 of the 40 seats in Wales.</p>
      <p>Repeating his call for a leave alliance, Mr Farage said: "if that leave alliance was put to the country it would win a very big majority".</p>

        <figcaption>Boris Johnson said last week he was "always grateful for advice" but would not enter into pacts</figcaption>

      <p>Mr Farage denied trying to split the vote and accused the Conservative Party of not wanting to come to "any sort of accommodation".</p>
      <p>"I'm going to go on trying for a few more days and make the point that in Torfaen, and other constituencies here in south Wales, the Conservatives haven't won for a hundred years," he said.</p>
      <p>"And they're not going to win here on 12 December, there is no chance of them winning.</p>
      <p>"So I would make this urgent plea to Boris Johnson and others - don't split the Brexit Party vote here in south Wales.</p>
      <p>"We are the challengers here in south Wales and if you're not in the field we will beat Labour in many of these constituencies."</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said the prime minister should ditch his Brexit deal because "it's not Brexit, it's a short term political fix and an attempt to win a general election".</p>
      <p>He urged Mr Johnson to "make it clear that we absolutely have to leave" the EU "at some point in 2020, with or without any form of deal".</p>
      <p>That deal "must be a trade deal, not one based on regulatory and political alignment", he added.</p>

      <p>Mr Farage said his party was ready to fight all the Welsh seats, if there was no pact with the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Asked earlier on BBC Radio Wales how many seats his party would win, Mr Farage said: "I've no idea. Do you know, when I launched the campaign for the European elections, going back to April this year, I had no idea how we would do.</p>
      <p>"We comfortably topped the poll in Wales, coming first in many, many seats."</p>
      <p>Asked if he would publish an election manifesto, Mr Farage said he would produce what he called a "contract with the British people".</p>
      <p>He said it was 95% ready and the party would launch it in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Launched just seven months ago, the Brexit Party has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-48275830">four Welsh Assembly members</a>, who were previously members of UKIP, the party Mr Farage used to lead.</p>
      <p>There are also two Welsh Brexit Party MEPs.</p>
