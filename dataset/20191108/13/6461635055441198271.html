      <h3>Arsenal are said to be looking to one of the most successful figures from Barcelona to solve some of their early-season woes.</h3>
      <p>Arsenal boss Unai Emery has recently come under pressure after failing to bring out results from a pretty decent team and practically losing control of the dressing room since the last weeks. <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/transfer-news/1196437/reports-arsenal-chief-raul-sanllehi-wanted-ex-barcelona-manager-luis-enrique-replace-arsene-wenger-over-unai-emery/"><b>Fox Sports</b></a> has now reported that former Barcelona coach Luis Suarez has been established by the Gunners on their radar as a potential replacement to their current boss.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are winless in their last four matches, after drawing 2-2 to Crystal Palace two weeks back. That draw was followed up by a dramatic loss against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup before tying two more matches versus Wolverhampton Wanderers and Vitoria SC over the last one week. Emery’s men now have a difficult visit to Leicester next in store.</p>
      <p>Luis Enrique has been without a job since resigning from the Spanish national team to be with his nine year old daughter, who tragically passed away some months ago after losing out to cancer. The former Barca boss is probably even wanted by his former side but the north Londoners will offer him a new challenge.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery’s assistant manager Freddie Ljungberg, along with Manchester City assistant and former player Mikel Arteta are also on the club’s list. It was earlier thought that Jose Mourinho would be named the Arsenal boss, but the Portuguese is no longer wanted by the Gunners as it seemed despite being closely linked with the side.</p>
      <p>Barcelona had their second most successful campaign under Luis Enrique in 2014/15 when they won the treble. The next year, the Blaugrana won the domestic double before the Copa del Rey in 2016/17, following which Enrique resigned. Lucho’s record with Spain is not bad either, so it is difficult to think why he won’t do a good job at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>Do you think Luis Enrique would be able to replicate his success at Arsenal as well?</p>
