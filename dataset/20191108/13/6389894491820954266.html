      <p>Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings is eyeing a $10 to $15bn (£11.7bn) listing in Hong Kong in a boost for the Asian financial hub which is being wracked by anti-government protests.</p>

      <p>The US-listed company is due to seek approval from Hong Kong’s listing committee on Thursday, Reuters reported citing sources.</p>
      <p>The listing process and bookbuild would then proceed during the week of 25 November.</p>
      <p>The float would be the world’s biggest ever cross-border secondary listing, according to Dealogic data.</p>
      <p>Alibaba holds the record for the world’s biggest initial public offering (IPO) for its $25bn float in New York in 2014.</p>

      <p>The listing comes as the government of Saudi Arabia is planning a float of two per cent of state oil company Saudi Aramco which could raise up to $30bn and beat Alibaba’s IPO record.</p>
      <p>Alibaba has been planning an August listing in Hong Kong, but pushed back its IPO in the face of fierce anti-government protests which created financial and political uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Alibaba last week reported second-quarter revenue increased by 40 per cent to 119.02bn yuan (£13.30bn) in the second quarter from 85.15bn yuan in the previous year.</p>

      <p>The result beat analysts expectations of revenue of 116.8bn yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The deal is being led by China International Capital Corp (CICC) and Credit Suisse.</p>
      <p> Major investment banks led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are currently jockeying for positions behind those two.</p>
      <p>Companies so far this year have sold shares worth $429bn via IPOs and follow-on sales – running far short of the $604bn they sold in the whole of 2018, according to data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Alibaba was contacted for comment.</p>
