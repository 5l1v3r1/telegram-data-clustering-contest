      <h1>Regina Pats' first-time scorers celebrate a hat trick</h1>
      <h2>Three members of the Regina Pats — Nikita Sedov, Drew Englot and Zack Smith — all scored their first WHL goals in the past three games.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:00:48+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>It turns out that Nikita Sedov’s scoring funk was mostly in his head.</p>
      <p>After failing to record a goal in the first 75 games of his WHL career with the Regina Pats, Sedov’s drought finally came to an end <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/reginas-carson-focht-scores-ot-winner-versus-pats-in-prairie-classic">on Oct. 27 when he knocked in a rebound against the Calgary Hitmen.</a></p>
      <p>“It was probably a mental game for me,” explained the Russian defenceman. “I just had to stop thinking about scoring that goal. I think that’s the reason why I got it.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-nikita-sedov-breaking-through-rookie-wall">There were times when the slump became a distraction for Sedov</a>, who had 19 points last season — all of them assists — in 68 games as a rookie.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, he’s relieved to put it behind him.</p>
      <p>“I got pretty excited,” Sedov recalled. “It’s not that easy to score a goal in this league. There’s a lot of great players. You have to adjust to the game — the pace, the speed, all that stuff.”</p>
      <p>Don’t forget the mental side.</p>
      <p>“It was kind of hard because you’re thinking ‘I want to get that first one,’ ” he continued. “It’s just not going in and you’re getting upset at yourself. As soon as you get the first one out of the way, you feel more calm and more confident. You don’t have to think about it.”</p>
      <p>Mind games, indeed.</p>
      <p>“Nikita has done a lot of really good things,” said Pats head coach Dave Struch, whose team faces the Swift Current Broncos on Friday (7 pm., Brandt Centre).</p>
      <p>“(The first goal) is his reward for all of the good that he has done. It took a long time but the reward is still there. We hope it doesn’t stop at one.”</p>
      <p>The same goes for Drew Englot and Zack Smith. The rookie forwards followed Sedov’s lead by scoring their first WHL goals in Regina’s next two outings.</p>
      <p>Englot did it <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/third-period-rally-propels-prince-albert-raiders-past-regina-pats">Friday versus the Prince Albert Raiders</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s obviously pretty special to score your first goal,” said Englot, who was playing his 13th WHL game. “Getting it out of the way definitely relieves the pressure a little bit. To me it feels like, after that first one, I can just start playing my game and start rolling.”</p>
      <p>There was nothing fancy about Englot’s marker, which came after he grabbed the puck along the boards, spun around and fired. The shot was headed wide but it hit a member of the opposition and went in.</p>
      <p>“Actually, we called it in the dressing room,” Englot noted. “Someone said my first goal was going to be off some shin pads. I go out for the next period and it went off a shin pad and in. We had a good laugh at that after the game.”</p>
      <p>It was much the same for Smith, who scored a fluky one <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/rebels-get-their-revenge-with-ot-win-over-pats">on Sunday versus the Red Deer Rebels</a>. It came in just his third WHL contest <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/zack-smith-made-a-memorable-outdoor-debut-with-the-regina-pats">after signing with Regina on Oct. 25</a>.</p>
      <p>“I took a shot and I think it went off a skate and a helmet and into the net,” said the former SJHLer. “It was a lucky bounce but I’ll take it. This is a tough league so sometimes players will go a lot of games without scoring goals. To get one early, I can hopefully build off that and keep getting better every game.”</p>
      <p>Struch couldn’t have said it better himself.</p>
      <p>“As coaches you always want them to build off success,” he added. “These guys got breaks from doing things the right way. So go line up at centre and do it again.”</p>
