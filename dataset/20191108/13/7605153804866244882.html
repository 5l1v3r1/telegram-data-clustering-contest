        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 8 – Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi on Friday met with Marsabit leaders following recent killings witnessed in the area which left 10 dead after a banditry attack.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The attacks are said to have happened on Tuesday night when bandits laid an ambush on a vehicle leaving three people dead.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Seven others are said to have been killed in a retaliatory attack, among them two police officers who were on patrol.</p>
      <p>The CS ordered locals in possession of illegal firearms to surrender them within 48 hours warning of dire consequences to those who will fail to honor the directive.</p>
      <p>Matiangi also warned that government will no longer tolerate violence occasioned by political rivalry and competition in the county.</p>
      <p>Marsabit leaders led by Governor Mohamud Mohamed during a presser on Wednesday said that the heavily armed bandits attacked two villages in Saku constituency, Marsabit County also making away with estimated 800 animals.</p>
      <p>The leaders called for government intervention saying that they can’t watch their people being brutally murdered.</p>
      <p>“We cannot keep crying every day, we cannot keep burying people months after months,” Ali said.</p>
      <p>The leaders urged the government to address rampant insecurity in the region.</p>
      <p>Marasbit County Commander Steve Oloo also called for peace among warring factions.</p>
      <p>“An eye for an eye is an old mentality,” he said.</p>
      <p>Government’s spokesperson Cyrus Oguna on Thursday told journalists that adequate security personnel had been deployed in the area to enhance safe of Marsabit residents.</p>
      <p>“As a government we are concerned about such incidents, as we speak a team has been dispatched to determine status of the attack,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the authorities are yet to establish what prompted the attack.</p>
      <p>This is the latest in a series of killings pitting clans against each other in the expansive county bordering Ethiopia.</p>
