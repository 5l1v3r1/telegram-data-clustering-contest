      <p>If you don't want to spend $150 to $230 on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/04/the-best-workout-headphones/">workout earbuds</a> that will inevitably end up at the bottom of your gym bag, Jaybird has a deal for you. Today, its Tarah Wireless Sport Headphones are on sale for half off. You can get a pair for just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H72WMLN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=ebedd81dfa755ec3f52fa2282a9f00b5&amp;language=en_US">$50</a>. That's the lowest price we've ever seen on these earbuds.</p>
      <p>While we haven't reviewed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/25/jaybird-tarah-wireless-sport-earbuds/">Tarah Wireless Sport Headphones</a>, Jaybird's earbuds have been a reliable, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/05/23/jaybird-freedom-wireless-earbuds/">well-regarded option</a> for years. They typically sound good out of the box and sound great with a little EQ fine tuning via the app. This model has an IPX7 rating, meaning not only can they stand a little sweat or rain, they're rated to survive even if you drop them in water. And they come with Speed Cinch cord that lets you control the music and answer calls.</p>
      <p>The earbuds promise six hours of battery life -- that's double the playing time of, say, Sony's totally wireless sport earbuds, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/09/sony-wf-sp700n-true-wireless-sports-earbuds-hands-on/#/">WF-SP700N</a>. They take about two hours to reach full charge, but a 10-minute quick charge will give you another hour of battery life. As we've said before, it's great that Jaybird included the quick-charge on its more affordable earbuds, and this deal makes the feature even more appealing. You won't find a quick charge option on many $50 wireless earbuds.</p>
      <p>This model may not have made our list of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/04/the-best-workout-headphones/">best workout headphones</a>, but at $50, they're significantly less expensive than any of those top-tier options and hard to pass up.</p>
