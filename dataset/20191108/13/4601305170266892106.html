      <p>Has this made it into a Hellboy comic yet? The effigy of Francois I de la Sarra (died 1363), can be found in the <a href="https://www.morges-tourisme.ch/en/P7160/chapelle-saint-antoine">Chapel of Sainte-Antoine</a> at La Sarraz, Vaud, Switzerland:</p>
      <blockquote>The chapel, dedicated to Saint Antoine, founded by Francis I of La Sarraz, was built by his son Aymon III between 1360 and 1372 as the first urban chapel. It is classified as a historical monument. It is a Protestant temple located on the territory of the Vaud municipality of La Sarraz.</blockquote>
