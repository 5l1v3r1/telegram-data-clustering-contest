      <h1>Jurgen Klopp calls on Liverpool to use "fan power" inside Anfield against Man City</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool boss also condemned the "senseless" 2018 incident which saw a bottle thrown at the City team bus before a Champions League quarter-final tie</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:46:21+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author">David Maddock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-maddock/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has warned Liverpool fans there can be no repeat of the ugly incidents where <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> ’s coach had bottles thrown at it.</p>
      <p>And instead, he has told supporters to channel their passion inside the ground - pleading with the Anfield faithful to raise their game even higher, to create an atmosphere that will intimidate even the champions.</p>
      <p>The canny German said everyone must raise their game.</p>
      <p>“We have to play our best game, everybody in the stadium has to be in absolutely top shape," he said. "The guy who sells the hot dogs has to be in the top shape!</p>
      <p>“Everybody has to be from the first second, come early into the stadium, come inside, nothing to do outside, wait for the team warming up, be there, be ready. That's what I wish for.”</p>

      <p>Klopp knows that City have buckled in the Anfield cauldron before, most notably in the 2018 Champions League quarter final, when they were shellshocked and blown away by a 20 minute perfect storm of Reds fire.</p>
      <p>They also seemed to freeze for a 10 minute second half spell at the famous old stadium in January 2018, when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> scored three times to take a 4-1 lead, and an ultimate victory which ended City’s 22 game unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>But he is also aware that any repeat of the incidents before the European quarter-final when the City coach was damaged needs to be avoided.</p>

      <p>He added: “I'm a big believer of fan power – in the stadium. That's completely different. We have to invest all our emotions before the game.</p>
      <p>"That's why I say – go in the stadium, nothing to do outside, have your food, go in, wait for the team, we will come, let's make a pretty special game of it.</p>
      <p>“In football, you never know what you get for it. But we know what we have to do for it. Let's make sure that we show that.”</p>

      <p>Klopp was blunt in his condemnation of the 2018 incident, and says the whole club and their support now has to ensure it never happens again.</p>
      <p>“(The coach incident) was a senseless thing. If somebody at Man City is concerned still, then it's our fault.</p>
      <p>“Not that we did it all together, we all didn't thrown the bottle or whatever it was, but it was one of us.</p>

      <p>“I wish I could say it will never happen again but unfortunately I can't. But what I can say is we will do everything that it will never happen again.</p>
      <p>“Everybody agrees to feel this responsibility that it won't happen again. That's why we are responsible. All of us have to make sure that something like this will never happen again.</p>
      <p>“It's long ago and since then nothing has happened. I don't think it was Man City specific.</p>

      <p>“Actually, we used to enjoy that (the coach welcome), when we come in, it's impressive.</p>
      <p>"It's a nice part of football, but if you overstep the line then it's not allowed that you do it anymore. That's how it is.”</p>
