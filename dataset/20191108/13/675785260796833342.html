      <h1>Liverpool and Man City hold Merseyside Police talks as 'coach greeting' poster circulates</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City's coach was pelted with missiles en route to Anfield ahead of the Champions League tie between the pair 19 months ago</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:21:03+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Merseyside Police have confirmed they have held talks with Liverpool and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> to avoid a repeat of the appalling coach attack on the champions' at Anfield.</p>
      <p>City's coach was pelted with missiles, including cans, bottles and flares, thrown by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> fans, as the vehicle made its way through to Anfield for a Champions League tie 19 months ago.</p>
      <p>The coach windscreen was smashed and damage to the vehicle so severe a replacement vehicle had to be drafted in to take the City squad back to Manchester following their 3-0 quarter-final, first leg defeat.</p>
      <p>City have sought assurances from their Liverpool counterparts that there will be no repeat of the coach attack when the two rival clubs meet on Sunday for a game that could have a huge bearing on the title race.</p>

      <p>Senior figures at City have been made aware of social media posts circulating among Liverpool fans in the build-up to the game, talking up another 'coach greeting' for their squad on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The poster urges supporters to line the streets around Anfield and bring 'pyro, pints, flags and banners' to greet the City team bus – just as they did back in April 2018 - and 'make it like a European night!'.</p>

      <p>Superintendent Paul White, of Merseyside Police, said: "As with any match, a comprehensive and appropriate policing operation has been put in place ahead of Sunday’s game and we have liaised with both clubs and their supporter groups.</p>
      <p>"We are aware of one poster on social media regarding a bus welcome. The corresponding last fixture ran smoothly and we are working to ensure this game can be enjoyed safely by all as well as minimising any disruption to local residents and roads.</p>
      <p>"As with all Premier League fixtures at Anfield, we will have officers on duty at the ground, both uniformed and plain clothed, supported by mobile CCTV, provided by Liverpool City Council, and specialist resources including the Dog Section, mounted police and the National Police Air Service.</p>
      <p>"We will also have a city centre policing plan in place throughout the day. This is standard procedure.</p>
      <p>"We know that this will be a busy operation and we hope that fans attending the match will act as ambassadors for their clubs.</p>
      <p>"As usual we would ask fans with tickets to arrive at the ground as early as possible. Fans without tickets should not attend at all; they will not be allowed entry into the stadium."</p>
      <p>Klopp sent a message to Liverpool fans on Friday, declaring: "It is our responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen again, that's why I said go into the stadium - there is nothing to do outside."</p>
