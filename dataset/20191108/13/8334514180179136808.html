      <p>(Reuters) - Robert Fisher, the son of Gap Inc’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GPS.N">GPS.N</a>) founders, took over as interim chief executive officer of the apparel retailer on Thursday, tasked with putting the company on the path to a turnaround and negotiating the planned spin-off of Old Navy.</p>
      <p>Fisher, who serves as the company’s chairman, replaced 15-year Gap veteran Art Peck, under whom sales of the company’s eponymous brand have tumbled due to out-of-fashion styles and competition from retailers like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ANF.N">ANF.N</a>) and Europe’s H&amp;M.</p>
      <p>Here are some quick facts about Fisher:</p>
      <p>** This is not the first time Fisher has been interim Chief Executive Officer, having held the role for about half of 2007 following the departure of Paul Pressler.</p>
      <p>** Joined Gap in 1980 as a store manager and has since held roles including chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Gap Inc, president of Banana Republic and President of the GAP brand.</p>
      <p>** Fisher quit as president of the Gap stores division in 1999, stating he wanted to “go fishing”. However, he remained a board member and became chairman in 2004 when his father stepped down.</p>
      <p>** Fisher, a Stanford and Princeton alum, is Gap’s largest shareholder with a 12.5% stake, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>** A San Francisco native, Fisher also serves on California’s Strategic Growth Council.</p>
