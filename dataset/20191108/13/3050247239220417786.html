      <h1>Standard Chartered Banking Group Joins Ethereum Enterprise Alliance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:02:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>International banking group Standard Chartered has become the latest member of a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a> standard-building organization, the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/eea">EEA</a>).</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.sc.com/en/media/press-release/standard-chartered-joins-enterprise-ethereum-alliance/">press release</a> issued on Nov. 6, Standard Chartered said the move would allow it to expand its client offerings across its 60 international markets.</p>
      <h3>Standard Chartered is latest EEA banking member</h3>
      <p>“Technology enables us to facilitate trade and investment across our footprint markets, improving client experiences and offering new services,” Group Chief Information Officer, Dr. Michael Gorriz, commented.</p>
      <p>The EEA <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alliance-formed-by-microsoft-intel-ubs-secures-support-of-eth-foundation">formed</a> in March 2017 as a collaborative effort exploring the development and implementation of blockchain solutions across economic sectors. Its membership base now runs into the hundreds, with participation from entities including <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/hyperledger">Hyperledger</a> and various other international banks such as Santander and Russia’s Sberbank.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/enterprise-ethereum-alliance-and-hyperledger-enter-formal-association-agreement">formal association</a> with Hyperledger, which itself offers enterprise-grade blockchain tools, came in October last year.</p>
      <p>The EEA also publishes informational material such as blockchain standards documents, among which was a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/enterprise-ethereum-alliance-publishes-on-blockchain-uses-in-telecoms">dedicated effort</a> for the telecoms industry in August.</p>
      <h3>Increasing blockchain maneuvers</h3>
      <p>“We are excited to be a part of the EEA and look forward to opportunities where we can collaborate with other leading industry players to deepen blockchain research and application in the banking sector,” Gorriz added.</p>
      <p>Standard Chartered has already made inroads into blockchain utilization. As Cointelegraph reported, the bank <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-bank-standard-chartered-uses-blockchain-for-supply-chain-finance">recently completed</a> a supply chain financing scheme and used the technology to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/standard-chartered-makes-letter-of-credit-transaction-using-blockchain">send</a> a cross-border letter of credit transaction.</p>
