      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - All Pentagon drones are accounted for, the U.S. Central command said in a statement on Friday, following reports from Iran’s state news agency that Iranian forces had shot down a foreign country’s drone.</p>
      <p>“Alleged reports of a U.S. drone being shot down are incorrect. If a UAS had gone down in the CENTCOM AOR it was not a #DoD asset. All U.S. equipment has been accounted for,” U.S. Central Command said in a post on Twitter.</p>
