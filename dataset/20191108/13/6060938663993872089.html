      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:31:30+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>All that glittered was gold for actress <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kangana-Ranaut">Kangana Ranaut</a> as she attended her brother, Aksht Ranaut’s grand engagement ceremony. Looking effortlessly regal in a golden silk sari, the beauty channelled some old-world charm by donning a vintage pearl neckpiece.</p>
      <p>The actress, who has long had a love affair with saris, gave us another look we can’t wait to try out during the upcoming wedding season. According to reports, Kangana picked a special Benarasi sari that she paired with a powder pink coloured blouse, which added contrast to her look.</p>
