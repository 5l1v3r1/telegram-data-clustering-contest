      <h1>Regina's curbside organic waste processing pilot project begins in April</h1>
      <h2>"It is estimated the pilot project will capture approximately 700 tonnes of Organic Waste for processing annually."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:00:33+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/jackerman55" target="_blank">Jennifer Ackerman</a></address>
      <p>Regina’s curbside composting pilot project is poised to launch by April 2020, according to a request for proposals (RFP) released by the city.</p>
      <p>The pilot will service 2,600 single-family residential households spread out across the city, the results of which will inform plans for city-wide implementation of the program in 2022/2023.</p>
      <p>“It is estimated the pilot project will capture approximately 700 tonnes of Organic Waste for processing annually,” says the RFP, which is seeking a system for processing food waste collected during the pilot.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/council-approves-organic-waste-pickup-with-pilot-due-for-2020">The pilot project was approved by city council in September 2018.</a> Nine councillors voted in favour, while two voted against. Those who voted against the program argued it would force “another thing onto the residents” who aren’t interested in having another bin to look after.</p>
      <p>At the time, solid waste manager Lisa Legault said the pilot will help staff design a better program by soliciting how the early adopters like the service. At this point, the idea is for a “scrape the plate” model, which would allow residents to keep meat, dairy, fat and even greasy pizza boxes out of the landfill.</p>

        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/city-recommends-curbside-organic-waste">It is all part of Waste Plan Regina (WPR), which looks to consider alternatives for meeting and managing long-term waste and diversion needs of the community.</a>
      </p>
      <p>In 2011, council set a long-term target of 65 per cent diversion of residential waste from the Fleet Street Landfill by 2020, but in order to achieve that goal, both curbside food waste and leaf and yard waste collection must be implemented, according to administration.</p>
      <p>“Previously, the City offered temporary depots to divert yard waste from the Landfill,” says the RFP. “Since inception of the yard waste depots, the amount of material collected has increased. A permanent Yard Waste Depot opened at the landfill in spring of 2019.”</p>
      <p>The site for the pilot project has been selected and will be prepared by the city on a lined portion of a landfill cell.</p>
      <p>Currently, no regulations for composting in Saskatchewan are available, so the proposed system will need to meet Alberta’s Standards for Composting Facilities, according to the RFP.</p>
      <p>Once fully implemented, administration predicts the program could divert up to 18,000 tonnes per year from the landfill, and far more if businesses and neighbouring cities joined in. It is also anticipated to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 760 tonnes, the equivalent of taking about 140 cars off the road.</p>
      <p>The pilot will cost the city approximately $3.5 million in capital funding from the solid waste reserve, most of which covers the cost of collection. Once fully implemented, it will cost $7.9 million annually, with a savings offset of $4.9 million when the city moves to biweekly garbage pick up.</p>
      <p>Regina is one of only two major Canadian cities that haven’t yet adopted a food waste pickup program. The other is Saskatoon, which has approved one, but the program will not be implemented until 2023.</p>
      <p>The RFP was posted on Oct. 30 and the submission deadline is Thursday, Nov. 21.</p>
