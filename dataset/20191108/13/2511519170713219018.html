      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RioFerdinand">Rio Ferdinand</a> has revealed the lengths <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/CristianoRonaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> went to early in his career to set him up for success.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand and Ronaldo were teammates at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterUnited">Manchester United</a> for six years, with Ronaldo emerging as a superstar at the club.</p>
      <p>And Ferdinand had revealed that the Portuguese forward was the first player he saw truly invest in an entourage to help him become one of the world’s best.</p>
      <p>“For Ronaldo, [he is] 34 now and he is still at the top and he has been in the top two players in the world for more than a decade,” Ferdinand told <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/ferdinand-psg-superstar-mbappe-is-the-one-who-inspires-my/zf3n584zz1xb18t20tc9dapou"><i>Goal</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“He was the first person I saw invest in a team. I went around his house and I saw about 10 people in his front room. I said, ‘Who are these people? What’s going on?’</p>
      <p>“He said: ‘That’s my chef, that’s my physio, that’s the doctor and that’s my personal trainer’. He left Man United as the best player in the world.”</p>
      <p>Ferdinand compared Ronaldo to another great sportsman in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LeBron_James">LeBron James</a> of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/NBA">NBA</a>, who has similarly built a team around him to set him up for superstardom.</p>
      <p>The former centre-half thinks young players should learn from their success and prepare in a similar manner to give themselves the best chance of sustained success, both physically and mentally.</p>
      <p>“He was on the right track,” Ferdinand explained. </p>
      <p>“They have both invested huge money in having the right team around them for their body and mind to perform at the highest level consistently.</p>
      <p>“I think if you give young players advice, then I would say if you have the resources then invest in yourself like that.”</p>
      <p>Ronaldo recently scored his 700th career goal, and is likely to surpass Ali Daei as the leading male international goalscorer of all-time.</p>
      <p>He is among the leading contenders for the Ballon d'Or, along with Lionel Messi and Virgil Van Dijk, which is due to be announced on December 2.</p>
