      <p>Experienced EFL referee Rob Lewis will take charge of Plymouth Argyle’s FA Cup first round tie at Bolton Wanderers tomorrow.</p>
      <p>He has shown 50 yellow cards and sent-of three players in 12 games this season.</p>
      <p>One of those matches was Argyle’s come-from-behind 1-1 League Two draw away to Swindon Town on October 12.</p>
      <p>Lewis booked seven players in that game, including the Pilgrims’ trio of Niall Canavan, Danny Mayor and Joe Riley.</p>
