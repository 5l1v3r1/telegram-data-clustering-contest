      <p>Rapper <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/jessi">Jessi</a> will be featuring as a guest babysitter on '<b>Trio’s Childcare Challenge</b>'.<br/><br/>During filming for the upcoming episode of <b>KBS</b>'s 'Trio's Childcare Challenge', moms <b>Kim Ji Sun</b>, <b>Kim Ga Yeon</b>, <b>Kim Mi Ryeo</b>, and <b>Jung Ju Ri</b> were worried when they saw Jessi and <b>Seo Jang Hoon</b> were the featured babysitters. They commented, <i>"You chose wrong," </i>and <i>"This is unexpected."</i><br/><br/>However, Jessi proved them wrong when they saw how gentle she was with the kids, and she showed a different side than her charismatic onstage presence. The rapper spoke to the kids in both English and Korean, and she later revealed she was a babysitter for 3 years while she was living in the United States.  </p>
      <p>This episode of 'Trio's Childcare Challenge' is airing on November 9 KST.</p>
