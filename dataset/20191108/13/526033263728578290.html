      <p>President <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> told reporters Friday that he has not committed to rolling back tariffs on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/china">China</a> – a statement directly opposite to what appeared to be a breakthrough <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/china-us-agree-roll-back-tariffs-phases-chinese/story?id=66">announcement from China on Thursday</a> that the two countries had agreed on a deal to start rolling back tariffs in phases, easing the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/US/us-china-trade-war-forcing-farmers-2nd-jobs/story?id=66068979">U.S-China trade war</a>.</p>

      <p>“Well, they would like to have a roll back,” Trump said of China. “I haven’t agreed to anything.”</p>
      <p>Trump told reporters as he left on a trip to Georgia that “they want to make a deal a lot more than I do. I’m very happy right now.”</p>
      <p>On Thursday, as part of a "phase one" agreement, Beijing and Washington acknowledged a plan to roll back tariffs, according to a Trump administration official. A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, also confirmed this agreement, saying if talks continued, a ‘phased cancellation’ of tariff hikes would progress, according to the Associated Press. The rollbacks would have been an important easing of the current trade war.</p>

      <p>Under Trump, tariffs have been placed on over $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, a move which caused retaliatory tariffs to be placed on U.S. exports, causing uncertainty among many U.S. businesses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/fitbit-move-production-china-ongoing-threat-tariffs/story?id=66182090">Soybean and corn farmers</a> have seen a drop in selling price of their crops, and companies like <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/fitbit-move-production-china-ongoing-threat-tariffs/story?id=66182090">GoPro and Fitbit</a> have announced that much of their manufacturing will be moved out of China to avoid tariff costs.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, in the wake of the announcement that both tariffs and the trade war could be rolled back, the S&amp;P 500 index jumped to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/china-us-agree-roll-back-tariffs-phases-chinese/story?id=66">a record-high by midday</a> and the Dow jumped more than 200 points. Trump took to Twitter, saying “Enjoy!”</p>
