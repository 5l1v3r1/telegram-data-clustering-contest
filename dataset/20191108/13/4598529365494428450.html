      <p>A referee is alleging that serial sexual assailant Dr. Richard Strauss masturbated in front of him in the showers of Ohio State University after a match. The referee allegedly immediately told then-assistant coach Jim Jordan, who shrugged him off, according to NBC News.</p>
      <p>Jordan’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>There have been <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/another-wrestler-jordan-snickered-told-about-abuse">multiple allegations</a> that Jordan knew of Strauss’ rampant sexual assaults and did nothing. The congressman has denied the allegations and claims that the people coming forward are politically motivated.</p>
      <p>Independent investigators found that Strauss had sexually assaulted at least 177 boys over twenty years.</p>
