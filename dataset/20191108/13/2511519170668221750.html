      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mohamed_Salah">Mohamed Salah</a> has ruled out any chance of thinking the title race is over if <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> beat <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> this weekend in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a>.</p>
      <p>The Reds are six points clear heading into the top-of-the-table clash, a fixture which has been decided over small margins in the past season or two.</p>
      <p>A late, missed penalty from Riyad Mahrez in this game last term meant the match ended in a goalless draw, while City defender John Stones memorably made a goalline clearance to prevent a Reds equaliser at the Etihad – with just 11.7 millimetres the difference between goal and no goal on that occasion.</p>
      <p>This time, both managers appear to be expecting a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-vs-manchester-city-preview-prediction-salah-firmino-mane-migue-delaney-a9194631.html">similarly intense and tight encounter</a> at Anfield, and Liverpool forward Salah says that regardless of the final score, there’s too long to go in the season to be thinking of lifting the trophy.</p>
      <p>“They were talking about that [title race] in December last year when we were six or seven points ahead saying it was over,” he <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/11857215/liverpool-vs-manchester-city-mo-salah-says-it-is-too-early-for-premier-league-title-talk">told </a><i>Sky Sports</i>.</p>
      <p>“It’s not over, it’s three games. If you have a bad period you can be in trouble again.</p>
      <p>“Even if we win it’s still a long way, it’s only November and way too early to talk about the Premier League.”</p>
      <p>Salah’s own form has dipped somewhat of late, with a sole penalty against Tottenham his only league strike in the last five.</p>
      <p>He’s not worried by outside criticism, though, and says his focus remains on doing his best for the team.</p>

      <p>“To be honest I don’t care about what people expect from me. As long as I’m scoring and the team is winning it’s fine</p>
      <p>“I don’t have to care about what people expect from me. That can put too much pressure on you and make you perform badly.</p>
      <p>“I’m doing what I want to do and I’m happy about it.”</p>
      <p>Salah hasn’t scored in his last three appearances against Man City for the Reds, having previously scored three times against Pep Guardiola’s team in 2017/18.</p>
