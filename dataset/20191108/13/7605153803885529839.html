      <p>Nyong’o says the system has undergone through a review to identify systematic weakness for improvement.</p>
      <p>He says the move is aimed at boosting the revenue base of the county.</p>
      <p>“The development of institutions capacity for efficient delivery of public services is crucial,” he says.</p>
      <p>Governor Nyong’o spoke on Friday in Kisumu during his second state of the count address that took place at Tom Mboya Labour College after it was gazette by Kisumu County Assembly.</p>
      <p>The County Government in the recent past contracted Strathmore University to help collect its revenue in the county through a cashless system.</p>

      <p>“Mr. Speaker, this is a war we must win, we have incorporated partners in this process to ensure proper standards, efficiency and measurable outlooks,” he said.</p>
      <p>Nyong’o hailed different partners who are currently working in the county for commendable implementation of projects.</p>
      <p>He took the opportunity to keep abreast the county residents what his administration is rolling this financial year.</p>
      <p>Nyong’o says the current budget had factored in funds for the improvements of county physical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>He says putting up a new county Assembly building and a Speaker’s house will soon start.</p>
      <p>“The construction of the Governor’s house and the renovation of the deputy governor’s house continue this year,” he added.</p>
      <p>During his address, Governor Nyong’o touched on revitalizing agriculture for food security and promotion of agribusiness, opening of Kisumu lakefront for business and investment and promoting industrialization and a vibrant service sector amongst others.</p>
