      <p>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli plan to run a cable car over Jerusalem to the walls of the Old City has angered Palestinians who say it would erase their heritage in areas they seek for a future state.</p>

      <p>The proposed cable car would shuttle some 3,000 tourists and worshippers per hour from Jerusalem’s western part to the eastern Old City in a four-minute ride. The plan moved forward this week when a special committee headed by Israel’s finance minister gave it a green light.</p>
      <p>The government says the roughly 220 million shekel ($63 million) scheme will alleviate heavy traffic to the area, which packs out with tourists and residents visiting its many Christian, Muslim and Jewish religious sites.</p>
      <p>“This is a strategic project to promote tourism to Jerusalem’s Old City,” said Israel’s Jerusalem and Heritage Minister Zeev Elkin. Israeli officials say it will also serve Palestinian residents of the city.</p>
      <p>But Palestinians say its planned route would place cable cars just meters above their homes in East Jerusalem and stir frictions over the future of a city at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
      <p>Hanan Ashrawi, a senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), termed the plan illegal.</p>
      <p>“The Israeli cable car project is an obscene violation of the cultural, historical, spiritual, geographic &amp; demographic character of Jerusalem,” Ashrawi said via Twitter.</p>
      <h3>POLITICAL PROJECT?</h3>
      <p>The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which includes the walled Old City, as capital of a future state. Israel annexed the area after capturing it in the 1967 Middle East war and says the entire city is its eternal and indivisible capital.</p>
      <p>The cable car project, intended to be ready for 2021, must still win final government approval.</p>
      <p>Tourists and guides at the Old City welcomed the project, saying it would reduce travel time and congestion. “The cable car is a very efficient way to appreciate the beauty of the place,” said Socorro Calixto, a tourist from the Philippines.</p>
      <p>But Palestinians in Silwan, an East Jerusalem neighborhood at the foot of the Old City, said it would encourage tourists to bypass them on the way to holy sites.</p>

      <p>“(It) will give the impression that it is a Jewish city and remove the Palestinian heritage from it,” Silwan resident Khaled Al-Zeer said, adding that “the foundations of the project will be built on our land”.</p>
      <p>Yotanan Mizrachi, an archaeologist who heads the Israeli NGO Emek Shaveh, is part of a coalition that opposes the cable car on grounds that it is a “political project” that will cause “irreversible damage to the historic city”.</p>
      <p>“(It is) going to influence the way we see and understand the archaeology and the antiquity of Jerusalem,” Mizarchi said.</p>
