      <h1>Liverpool bid for Barcelona’s duo amidst threat of losing indispensable player</h1>

      <h3>Real Madrid have prepared an offer of €110 million for Liverpool’s UEFA player of the year, Virgil van Dijk. The Champions League winners look to Barcelona to strengthen their backline.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/08/liverpool-umtiti-semedo-transfers-van-dijk-to-real-madrid/"><b>Caught Offside</b></a> claims that the Reds manager Jurgen Klopp is keen on prioritizing Barcelona defenders Nelson Semedo and Samuel Umtiti in the upcoming transfer market.</p>
      <p>With speculations surrounding Van Dijk and recent injury to Joel Matip, Liverpool are really struggling at the back.</p>
      <p>And with not many concrete replacement options, like Dejan Lovren and Joe Gomez who played in the past two fixtures respectively, the club turns to Ernesto Valverde’s side for help.</p>
      <p>LFC are yet to find a replacement for Alberto Moreno on the left-back position and Samedo can be the perfect player for them to fill that void. The Portuguese, however, is currently playing a crucial part at Barcelona and will surely be favorite to stay at the club.</p>
      <p>The European Champions will definitely feel the loss of Van Dijk if he does decide to join Los Blancos, and will look to Umtiti to replace the Dutchman. The Frenchman is currently struggling with a frequent knee injury and looks to restore his spot in the Catalan’s startling lineup.</p>
      <p>Claims of potential  €90 million deal have been made for the Barca pair with both Samuel Umtiti and Nelson Semedo being quality defenders who can improve Liverpool’s defense regardless of Virgil van Dijk’s future decision.</p>
      <p>How will the Blaugrana cope if this deal goes through?</p>
