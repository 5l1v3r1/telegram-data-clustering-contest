      <p>A Kilmarnock woman who duct-taped a muzzle to her dog’s face before going on holiday has been branded “sickening” by a sheriff.</p>
      <p>Elisabeth Steel, 44, appeared before Kilmarnock Sheriff Court where she admitted the horrific cruelty towards her dog, named Rio and causing him unnecessary suffering.</p>
      <p>Steel, of Methven Avenue in the town, left her collie locked in a kitchen without food or water and duct-taped a muzzle to the animal’s face.</p>
      <p>Steel pleaded guilty to failing to provide adequate care for Rio, who was left abandoned with sores, hair loss and fleas while Steel went off on a holiday.</p>
      <p>The court heard how Rio was only saved after a neighbour heard the dog whimpering from the property downstairs on July 18 this year.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said: “The witness was aware that the accused had left early that day to go on holiday.”</p>
      <p>He looked through the window and saw the dog wearing a muzzle “wrapped with black tape” and “noted that there was no food or water”.</p>
      <p>The neighbour contacted the Scottish SPCA and later the police.</p>
      <p>The court heard how police witnesses who attended saw the black and white collie lying within the kitchen area.</p>
      <p>After forcing entry into the property, the officers found that the dog was still alive and began to walk around.</p>
      <p>The fiscal depute stated: “The door was bolted shut. There was no food or water within the bowls and the dog was wearing a muzzle wrapped in black tape and was also wearing a collar which was too tight.”</p>
      <p>Steel was interviewed and told police that she was the owner of the dog who was later taken into the care of the SSPCA.</p>
      <p>Steel’s lawyer Graeme Cunningham said he would say more on her behalf after social work reports had been prepared for the court.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alastair Watson said: “This is a pretty sickening piece of behaviour towards a helpless animal and I will have to consider how best to deal with you on the next occasion.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Watson added that he would likely disqualify Steel from owning animals when she reappears for sentencing next month.</p>
      <p>Following Steel’s appearance in court, Scottish SPCA chief inspector Laura McIntyre said: “This was an awful case of cruelty causing Rio to suffer unnecessarily.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased Steel has admitted the offence and we look forward to hearing the sentencing in this case.”</p>
