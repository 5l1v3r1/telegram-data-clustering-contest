      <p>Three-time European champions Spain have announced their latest squad for their upcoming 2020 European Championship qualifiers. Only one FC Barcelona player has been selected, while 10 stars were snubbed for selection.</p>

      </p>
      <p>La Furia Roja will host Malta next week Friday in a Euro 2020 qualifier, and then play host to Romania the following Monday. Spain have already qualified for next year's European Championship, however, having won six of their eight matches so far.</p>
      <p>Jordi Alba did not make Robert Moreno's latest squad, perhaps due to his recent injury struggles. The left-back was taken off during Barca's league loss at Levante last weekend, and missed the club's UEFA Champions League clash with Slavia Prague altogether this week.</p>
      <p>Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Dani Olmo received his first call-up to the senior squad, having impressed hugely in Croatia. The 21-year-old is in the team ahead of the likes of Isco and Dani Ceballos, while Atletico Madrid's Koke was also overlooked.</p>
