      <p>After his win this past weekend against Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 244, Darren Till admitted that he <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/4/20947540/ufc-244-mma-news-interview-darren-till-kelvin-gastelum-fight-injury-fake-new-york">considered faking an injury to get out of the fight</a>. This is something that UFC veteran Diego Sanchez has issued a lengthy rant about.</p>

      <p>Till was successful in his middleweight debut at UFC 244, getting past Gastelum by split decision in an uneventful fight. The Liverpudlian’s comments after the fight drew a lot of attention after he talked about how nervous he was entering the fight with Gastelum and even considered faking an injury to get out of it.</p>
      <p>Although many respected Till’s honesty in his comments, The Ultimate Fighter season one winner Sanchez put Till on blast, commenting on ESPN’s Ariel Helwani’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B4iGXYYBwOw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Instagram</a> post saying he can’t relate at all to the 26-year-old.</p>

      <blockquote>Every fighter?! this be some number one bull—-!!!! Maybe he is coming from some money or something! All the work! decades! to finally get some real money! Fake a injury I’m sorry Ariel but don’t butter till up like this is cool to get a good interview! Mike Perry what you think p***y s—t or p***y s—t? Match him up with Yoel Romero and he really is gonna fake a injury!! Sorry guy I just can’t relate to this weak ass s—t.</blockquote>
      <p>Sanchez, who has always had an intensity mentality in and out of the cage, has been fighting in the UFC for almost fifteen years. Starting his career as a middleweight, “The Nightmare” has fought as low as 145-pounds in his lengthy career, but is now fighting at welterweight.</p>
