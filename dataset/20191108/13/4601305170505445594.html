      <h1>GIF site Gfycat announces mass deletions, threatens Archive Team with lawsuit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:13:01+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>Gfycat is a site that people upload GIFs to so they can share them with other people reliably. Used most conspicuously to host memes, clips from other media, and animated porn, it <a href="https://twitter.com/GfycatHelp/status/1191770073259577344">announced Wednesday</a> that it was planning to permanently delete old, anonymously-posted images within days. <a href="https://www.archiveteam.org/">Archive Team</a>, a web preservation initiative coordinated by Jason Scott, set about archiving the site's soon-to-vanish content. So Gfycat's CEO, Dan McEleney, <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1192518136878321664">threatened it with a lawsuit</a>, describing archival of the memes it hosts as a "denial of service attack" and demanding compensation.</p>

      <p>The fallout is ongoing on Twitter, with users of the site panicking about their old content and the company asking for (and being refused) private negotiations with Internet Archive, which Scott <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1192595714905432065">points out</a> is not the same entity as the legally-threatened Archive Team.</p>
