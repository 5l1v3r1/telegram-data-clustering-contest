      <p>The Google probe is being led by the Texas attorney general's office and is known to be focused on its search and digital advertising businesses.</p>
      <p>The Alphabet unit also faces two other major inquiries — a U.S. Justice Department investigation and a probe by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee — both of which have broad reviews of the big internet companies underway.</p>
      <p>Last year, Google was fined 4.34 billion euros by the European Commission, saying the tech giant gave itself an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.</p>
