      <p>Some kindergarteners in Bekasi, West Java got the shock of their young lives thus far when a man was so incensed by their singing in the morning that he threw rocks at the school.</p>
      <p>According to the police in Cibarusah sub-district, where the incident allegedly occurred on Wednesday morning, a 38-year-old man identified as Jaya was livid when he walked up to the kindergarten.</p>
      <p>“The kids in the Islamic kindergarten were singing and learning. And then a witness saw the culprit approach the school and threw rocks at it twice,” Cibarusah Police Chief Sukarman said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The culprit shouted [at a teacher], ‘You’re too noisy! You’re disturbing my rest!’”</p>
      <p>Sukarman added that the rocks Jaya threw only hit the kindergarten’s fence and no one was injured during the incident. He did say that the children were spooked, but their teacher immediately took them inside the classroom to keep them safe.</p>
      <p>“No child was traumatized,” he said.</p>
      <p>The police are still investigating the incident. Jaya may be charged with committing an unpleasant act under Indonesia’s criminal code, which is a crime punishable by up to one year in prison.</p>
      <p>Teachers at the kindergarten, who reported the incident to the police, have not pressed charges against Jaya. A local official said that Jaya and representatives from the kindergarten will soon meet in a mediation session and that the latter is ready to forgive as long as Jaya promises not to repeat his actions.</p>
