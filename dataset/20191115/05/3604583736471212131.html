      <h1>Eureka Osteo sets active example on the move | Run For A Cause 2019</h1>

      <p>TIME has come for Eureka Osteo's team to show they do not just talk the talk but they "run the run", as they say.</p>
      <p>Stepping out in Sunday's Run For A Cause is proving both a team bonding exercise and a chance to set an active example for their clients and community in healthy living.</p>
      <p>The Ballarat Foundation's Run For A Cause is this year introducing the corporate and schools teams challenges in a bid to rally a bid more pride on the line.</p>
      <p>Eureka Osteo remedial massage therapist and marathon runner Chris Hiscock seized this as a chance to mean business in promoting community exercise and helping people get moving more.</p>
      <p>"It really is about setting a good example for people coming here," Mr Hiscock said. "We've got a few runners but we all do our own separate sporting things and exercise with different groups. This is a good focus for us together.</p>
      <p>"...We are also experiencing what it feels like and means to walk or run in this event."</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Run For A Cause's focus this year on support for early childhood development is also personal to Mr Hiscock, who has previously worked with disadvantaged youngsters.</p>
      <p>"My son is lucky in that he does not face the challenges some children do. We need to be making sure no child is at a disadvantage," Mr Hiscock said. "Early years are absolutely critical to invest in."</p>
      <p>One in five children starts school developmentally behind their peers, Australian Early Development Census research shows.</p>
      <p>Participating in Run For A Cause will support The Ballarat Foundation's seven charity partners working on the frontlines of early childhood development: Ballarat Reads, Ballarat Community Health's paediatric programs, Eureka Mums, Eureka Community Kindergarten Association, Uniting Ballarat, Ballarat Toy Library and Playgroup Victoria's Sebastopol Hub.</p>
      <p>Fifty per cent of Run entry fees is shared evenly between The Ballarat Foundation's program Ballarat Reads and a charity partner of choice.</p>
