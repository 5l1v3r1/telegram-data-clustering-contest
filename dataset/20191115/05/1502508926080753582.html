      <p>On May 9, the top court had paved the way for declaration of results of SSC CGLE-2017 by vacating its stay on it. On August 31 last year, the top court had stayed the declaration of result of the SSC CGL exam result, which were marred by allegations of paper leak, saying it seemed that the entire test and system was "tainted".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/staff-selection-commission">Staff Selection Commission </a>had released a clarification about CGL 2017 final result in August. The Commission clarified that the evaluation of Skill Test, which is the Tier III of SSC CGL selection process, takes about 3-4 months. The document verification process and skill test for CGL 2017 applicants was conducted in July this year.</p>
      <p>However, a plea had been filed in the Supreme Court on Ocotober 31 seeking stay on issuing of joining letters to the selected candidates of 'tainted' SS CCGL 2017, till the apex court appointed committee submits its report. The top court had constituted a 7-member committee to suggest measures to make entrance exams meant for jobs and admissions in educational institutions fool proof.</p>
      <p>The fresh plea filed recently by one Shantanu Kumar also sought directions to the committee, headed by retired apex court judge Justice G S Singhvi, to look into the case diary, charge sheets filed by CBI and the bail orders passed by a trial court in the SSC question paper leak case.</p>
