      <p>Microsoft’s OneDrive for Android has received an update. The update brings some visual changes, meaning that the layout of the file list and tile views now look more gorgeous and consistent than the previous version. Microsoft said that it’s in the process of improving the layout of the file list and tile views, so we can expect the layout to look more gorgeous in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Add to that, with the latest update installed, you’ll be able to search results for files in the business and school accounts faster and better. Moreover, taking the app to Version 5.43, the update offers minor bug fixes, performance and reliability improvements. You can see the official changelog below.</p>
      <blockquote>We’re improving the layout of file list and tile views so your content looks more gorgeous &amp; consistent across all your devices. Searching for files in business and school accounts just got faster and better (sorry if that made it easier to find all your homework assignments!).<br/>And as always, we’ve squashed minor bugs, and made performance &amp; reliability improvements across the entire app. If you run into any issues, please shake your device and tap “Report a Problem”.</blockquote>
