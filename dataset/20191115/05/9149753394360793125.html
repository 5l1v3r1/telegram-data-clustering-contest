      <p>Ladies and gentlemen, toydarians and tauntauns, we've got ourselves a Fortnite/Star Wars crossover event.</p>
      <p>Epic announced the crossover with a new video showing off an original trilogy Stormtrooper skin you'll be able to snag. Do Stormtroopers have better aim than Fortnite bots? Only one way to find out.</p>

      <p>You can purchase the skin in the usual item store, or if you want some extra bang for your buck, you can get a code for it by purchasing <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/">Jedi: Fallen Order</a> on the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/home?epic_affiliate=wario64&amp;epic_gameId=star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Epic Games Store</a>. It's still available on Steam and Origin/EA Access if you prefer that, you just don't the extra goodie.</p>
      <p>Even better, a Star Destroyer has appeared in the sky over the Fortnite map.</p>

      <p>At present time, it appears the Star Destroyer is a considerable distance from the island. It could be that once it gets closer we'll some sort of new occurrence, but only time will tell.</p>
