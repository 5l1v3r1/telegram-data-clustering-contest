      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/11/samsung-galaxy-fold-sold-out-again-in-china-during-the-11-11/">Days after the re-launched Galaxy Fold went on sale in China</a>, embattled Huawei today <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/huawei-mate-x-5g-foldable-phone-to-hit-the-market-tomorrow/">released its Foldable</a> Mate X for sale in its home country – China. The 16,999 yuan (US$2,403) priced Huawei Mate X was earlier today available for sale on <a href="https://www.vmall.com/product/10086831441169.html#10086239677333">Vmall</a>, and from the look of its, it got the much-needed reception from its Chinese fans. The Chinese firm also announced a 50% discount on the first time display replacement of Huawei Mate X.</p>
      <p>Much like the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/08/galaxy-fold-sells-out-in-china-in-just-five-minutes/">Fold from its main rival – Samsung</a>, the Huawei MateX according to Huawei sold out under a minute. It, however, didn’t disclose the number of units sold but admitted that very limited units were available for sale. The second and next sale is scheduled for  November 22 at 10:08 China time.</p>
      <p>Unlike the rival Galaxy Fold, the Mate X is at the moment only available in China. A global launch is, however, under review. Huawei at its October 23rd launch event in China had said that the ”Mate X release is based on carriers’ 5G roll out in different regions.”</p>
      <p>If you are a fan of the Foldable Mate X and lives outside of China, you might have to wait a little longer. Though the device will eventually make it out of China, the firm is perhaps testing the reception in its home market before a wider rollout. The limited launch isn’t unexpected, given that the whole foldable phone form factor is still at its infancy, and might take more time for a wider reception.</p>
      <h3>US Ban and the Huawei Mate X</h3>
      <p>Another thing that might hinder a timely global rollout is the fact that it does not ship with <b>Google Play</b>, which means users will not be able to access <b>services</b> like the <b>Google Play</b> app store, Gmail, or <b>Google</b> Maps.  That is due to the on-going sanction from the US commerce department, though many may argue there are <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/23/huawei-mate-30-this-is-how-to-install-google-play-store-quickly/">different workarounds to get the Play serves to work on the device</a>.</p>
