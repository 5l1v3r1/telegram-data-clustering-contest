      <h1>“I Stand With Yuendumu”: More Than $65,000 Raised To Help The Warlpiri Seek Justice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:50:24+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:50</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Conaghan</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of dollars has been raised for the Yuendumu community as they fight for an independent investigation into the death of Kumanjayi Walker.</p>
      <p>It took less than two days for $65,000 to be raised on GoFundMe, which will help pay for lawyers and other experts.</p>
      <p>While people are mourning the death of the 19-year-old, for many the shooting is also a symptom of the institutionalised racism that still exists in Australia. <a href="https://junkee.com/northern-territory-shooting/229263">Kumanjayi Walker</a> was shot by police in his home last Saturday after they came to arrest him for breaching parole.</p>
      <p>The Warlpiri people of Yuendumu hope an independent investigation will ensure this never happens again.</p>
      <p>“This is the time to address the broader systemic issues that so deeply affect our Aboriginal communities,” the campaign reads.</p>
      <p>“The families and communities affected will be better served having separate legal representation as there is clearly a need for system change; especially around policing and other broader issues that have come to the forefront as a result of this tragic event.”</p>

      <p>While many of the lawyers will be working for free, the community still needs to cover the costs of airfares, transport, and “forensic expertise”.</p>
      <p>The campaign also refers to the teachings of the Palm Island case, referring to the 2003 riots which were sparked after the death of 36-year-old Cameron Doomadgee, who was arrested then later died in custody with massive internal injuries.</p>
      <p>The officer in that case was charged with murder but later acquitted of manslaughter.</p>
