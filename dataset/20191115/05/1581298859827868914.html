      <p>The state's first heart transplant patient travelled to Perth last month to celebrate 25 years of the Advanced Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplant Service.</p>
      <p>Esperance local Rodney Western was the first patient to receive a heart following the opening of the service at Royal Perth Hospital in November 1995.</p>
      <p>The service marked the first time West Australians could receive heart treatment and care in their own state.</p>
      <p>Mr Western's successful procedure paved the way for 198 WA patients to receive healthy heart transplants.</p>
      <p>He has been visiting the team at Fiona Stanley Hospital for the past 24 years and enjoyed a healthy life.</p>
      <p>Mr Western said his transplant enabled him to live a full life of work, hobbies, time with his wife, three children and eight grandchildren.</p>
      <p>"Although it's been 24 years since my transplant I remember clearly the day I received the phone call asking me to come Perth for the transplant, I was excited and nervous at the same time," he said.</p>
      <p>"It all worked out really well with the team having me up and walking quite soon after the operation."</p>
      <p>On average, there are 10 heart transplants and seven Ventricular Assists Devices implanted each year in WA.</p>
