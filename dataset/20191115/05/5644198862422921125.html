      <p>REUTERS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved BeiGene Ltd's lymphoma treatment, validating the China-based drugmaker's strategy of largely using data from trials held outside the United States to file for approval.</p>
      <p>The company tested the treatment, Brukinsa, in 118 patients with mantle cell lymphoma enrolled in two studies. About three-quarters were Asian, 21per cent Caucasian, and just between 10per cent to 15per cent were from the United States, BeiGene said.</p>
