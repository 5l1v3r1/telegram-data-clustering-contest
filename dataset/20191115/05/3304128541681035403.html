      <p>Harambee Stars pulled a remarkable 1-1 away draw with Pharaohs of Egypt in an AFCON 2021 qualifier on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Pundits predicted an easy win for the record African champions, but Stars put up a gallant show in Alexandria and could have fancied a win.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the match, the Kenya men’s soccer team risked being kicked out of their hotel over nonpayment.</p>

      <p>The team left Nairobi without accommodation money, which the ministry of sports promised to send, but had not done so by Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>It took the intervention of Egypt’s minister for sports Dr Ashraf Sobhy, who guaranteed their stay for the night.</p>
      <p>Back to match, Stars started brightly and at one point looked likely to score, however, a lapse in concentration towards the end of the first half, however, saw the hosts take the lead.</p>

      <p>Mohammed Kharaba pounced on a poor back pass from left back Erick Ouma, before beating Ian Otieno on the second attempt in the 42nd minute for the opener.</p>
      <p>Ian was brought in after St. George’s goalkeeper Patrick Matasi picked an injury with just about seven minutes played.</p>
      <p>The coach Francis Kimanzi’s charges returned for second stanza with a clear intention to take a result home. And after a sustained pressure, Michael Olunga leveled, striking home from inside the box after being set up by Cliff Nyakeya.</p>
      <p>Stars return home for Monday’s second group match against Togo at the Kasarani Stadium. The match will kick-off at 7pm.</p>
