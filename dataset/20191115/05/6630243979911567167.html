      <p>Ivorian and Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, on Thursday confirmed his intention to contest the presidency of the country’s football federation.</p>
      <p>According to the 41-year-old, he had picked Ivorian football ahead of an offer to have taken a role at his former club, English Premier League side, Chelsea.</p>
      <p>“ I could’ve decided to stay at Chelsea where all conditions are perfect, but I’ve decided to invest in local (national) football because I love Ivory Coast,” he is quoted to have said.</p>

      <p>In August 2019, local media outlets reported that Drogba was due to contest for the top leadership post of the Ivorian Football Federation, FIF.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea man was reported to have filed his application at the time. All things being equal, he will face competition from among others, a former playing colleague turned politician Bonaventure Kalou, who was in October 2018 elected mayor of the municipality of Vavoua.</p>
      <p>Incumbent FIF president Augustin Sidy Diallo, will be another candidate to beat. He has been in the role since 2011.</p>
      <p>Drogba retired from football in 2018 and was on record to have voiced ambitions of heading the football federation in the West African country.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that interests me: I want to get more involved. I think more and more about it. I know Ivorian football, I have played in selection for years and I invested in Ivorian football lately …</p>
      <p>“I have not made my decision yet, but, if all conditions are met, why not?” he said in an interview on French broadcaster, RFI.</p>
