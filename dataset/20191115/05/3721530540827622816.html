      <p>Everyone <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/9/20907051/pokemon-sword-shield-three-starter-pokemon-info">wants to take care</a> of <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>’s water-type starter Pokémon Sobble — at least until they saw his leaked final evolution. Sobble is a shy, sad lizard that turns invisible when it gets wet. He cries a lot, but is actually pretty tough.</p>
      <h3>What is Sobble weak and strong against?</h3>
      <p>Sobble is a water-type Pokémon, which makes it weak against water, grass, and electric moves. It’s good against ground, rock, and fire Pokémon — but only if you’re using water-type moves. Other moves, some of which are normal, dark, and bug, may not have the same impact.</p>

      <h3>What does Sobble evolve into?</h3>
      <p>At level 16, Sobble will evolve into Drizzile — an emo-looking lizard that drops the sad look for a more moody pose.</p>

      <p>Its final evolution is Inteleon, still pure water-type, at level 35.</p>
      <p>Each of these evolutions, including Sobble, has a passive ability called Torrent, which powers up water-type moves by 50 percent when HP is below <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> of its maximum. The Hidden Ability is Sniper, which ups the power of critical hits by 225 percent, up from 150 percent.</p>
      <h3>What are Sobble, Drizzile, and Inteleon’s best moves?</h3>
      <p>Liquidation is Sobble and its evolutions most powerful move, learned at level 28. Rain Dance is learned at level 36, which will power up water-type moves. Drizzile will learn a bug-type move, U-turn, at level 30, which will be important in taking on grass-type Pokémon.</p>
      <p>To battle against weaknesses, you might want to teach your Sobble — or its evolutions — moves like TM 27, Icy Wind, or TM51, Icicle Spear, to take on grass-type Pokémon. TM53, Mud Shot, will be effective against electric-types.</p>
      <h3>Can I get a Sobble if I didn’t choose it as my starter?</h3>
      <p>There are two ways to get Sobble and its evolutions: pick it as your starter or trade for one with a friend. Using a Ditto to make a copy of Sobble (or, again, its evolutions) is a way to convince a pal to give you one — then they won’t have to give up their own and can just make a copy.</p>
