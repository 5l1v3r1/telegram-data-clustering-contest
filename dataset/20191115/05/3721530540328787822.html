      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/40381"><i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i></a> is a game about exploration, and it happens to also have laser swords. It’s a Metroidvania game, which means you’ll be navigating planets, picking up new abilities, and returning to places you’ve already visited open new paths.</p>
      <p>You’ll have to fight your way past local fauna and stormtroopers in each place you visit, but you’ll spend the majority of your time solving puzzles and platforming. You’ll find chests to open and secrets to pick up throughout the game. The chests contain cosmetic items, like new poncho colors or lightsaber parts. The secrets are collectibles that increase your health or Force gauges after you pick up three.</p>
      <p>Our guides will help you along each step of your Jedi journey. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-guide/2019/11/15/20960267/beginners-guide-tips-tricks">Our beginner’s guide</a> will give your our tips for getting started.
