      <h1>Anonymous Launches Massive Bitcoin (BTC) Fund to Build Up Crypto System, Hammer Money Manipulation</h1>

      <p>Anonymous organizers who met on the web forum 4chan have launched a hefty Bitcoin fund to support blockchain, cryptocurrency and other tech solutions that protect privacy rights and freedom.</p>
      <p>The Unknown Fund is designed to combat egregious corporate behavior and social networks that harvest personal data in order to sell it for a profit. The fund will invest and donate $75 million in Bitcoin (BTC) to nonprofit organizations working on ideas that support anonymity.</p>
      <p>The transnational group says the fight it’s waging against corporations is for the benefit of anyone who wants to protect their personal data and stop the manipulation of public opinion.</p>
      <p>“<i>Our ranks consist of representatives of many countries and nationalities, united by a virtual comradely spirit and the belief that we are fighting for the good of many, and not for the benefit of some. Anonymous is the voice of those who believe in truth, freedom and the right to self-expression.”</i></p>
      <p>The Unknown Fund intends to leverage Bitcoin donations to “create a new environment, a new and honest monetary system, and to make the world a better place.”</p>
      <p>Anonymous adds,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Now the main goal of large corporations is to collect as much information as possible about the personal lives of people, and then use it for their enrichment. And they do a great job of it by making ordinary people get poorer. We are ready to fight for change and protect people…</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Our opponents should not doubt our determination or conviction. We will continue to fight as much as necessary to achieve our goal.”</i>
