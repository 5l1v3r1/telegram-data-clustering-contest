      <p>Call Scott Bacon <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/yale-career-experts-say-that-to-get-your-next-job-your-resume-should-always-have-these-5-simple-things.html">the résumé expert.</a></p>
      <p>Not only has Bacon <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/this-google-executive-reviewed-more-than-20000-resumes-he-found-these-5-stunning-mistakes-over-over.html">helped recruit software and network engineers for Google,</a> but he has reviewed more résumés than the average person. In fact, during the year Bacon worked at Google, he says around 3 million résumés were received by the iconic tech company.</p>
      <p>If you're still struggling <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/microsoft-career-experts-say-that-your-resume-should-always-have-these-5-simple-things.html">to craft a high-quality résumé,</a> let the wisdom of Bacon--who now works as a senior talent advocate at Hired--help you land your next job interview. Here are the 7 common résumé mistakes this former Google recruiter says you should avoid if you want to impress your next employer. </p>
      <h3>1. The objective statement.</h3>
      <p>Objective statements are "a bit old school and are generally pretty generic," Bacon says. Objective statements often run a risk of being too specific for one particular job, and can disqualify you from a position you have your eye on. Bacon suggests you create a list of skills in place of a poorly crafted objective statement.</p>
      <h3>2. Too much generalization.</h3>
      <p>It won't always be appropriate or effective for you to submit one résumé to multiple employers. Bacon recommends you tailor each résumé you send out, and utilizing key words or phrases relevant to a particular industry.</p>
      <h3>3. Non-specific achievements.</h3>
      <p>You may have work experience, but are you communicating how well you actually performed? Give performance metrics or list specific awards or projects. "A good rule of thumb," explains Bacon, is to "use one line for responsibilities, two lines for accomplishments."</p>
      <h3>4. Don't be obvious.</h3>
      <p>There are a few things that you can assume. For example, employers will already know to ask about your references, so consider leaving out the all too familiar "references available upon request" line in your résumé. When you put in useless and obvious information into your résumé, you waste space and may appear out of touch.</p>
      <h3>5. Ugly or non-structured formatting.</h3>
      <p>Recruiters glance at your résumé for an average of just six seconds before they decide how interested they are in reading what you've submitted to them. Don't clutter your page. Keep things organized, clear, and easy to understand. Put the most important information at the top left corner of your résumé, as Bacon notes that this is where eyes go first. Remember: your goal is to entice recruiters to keep reading.</p>
      <h3>6. Keep buzzwords out of the picture.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/an-a-to-z-of-dumb-jargon-words-you-better-stop-using.html">Using buzzwords like "synergy" and "dynamic" won't give you a professional leg up.</a> These words, according to Bacon, "are now so drenched in corporate group speak [that it makes you sound like] you are trying to appeal to some cultural amalgam of people that don't exist at a company." Instead, match the language of the job description, and go no further than that.</p>
      <h3>7. Oversharing.</h3>
      <p>Even if you have an abundant amount of experience, listing every job you have ever had is not a good idea. This means taking out experience that is more than a decade old, and leaving out entry-level jobs that are not applicable. Keep your focus only on positions relevant to the job you are applying for if you want to truly shine.<br/> </p>
