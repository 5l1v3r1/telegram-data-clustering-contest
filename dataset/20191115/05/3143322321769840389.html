      <p>MBOMBELA – The N4 toll route between Montrose and the Kaapsehoop intersection was closed for approximately five hours on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The provincial SAPS spokesman, Brig Leonard Hlathi, said that the community of Elandshoek blocked the N4 with burning tyres, heavy rocks and trees.</p>
      <p>They were protesting about Thomas Sibanyoni (42), who died in police custody on Saturday.<br/>According to Hlathi, he was found to have hanged himself with a shoelace in a temporary holding cell, after police arrested him for a domestic violence-related complaint.</p>
      <blockquote>“The community insist that police killed him,” he said.<br/><br/>“An inquest docket was opened and a postmortem was conducted. The results did not suggest any foul play.”</blockquote>

      <p>Flying Squad and Public Order Policing were called to assist and the road was reopened around 00:40 on Thursday morning. According to the Trans African Concessions spokesman, Solange Soares, the closure was as a result of protesters who blockaded the road.</p>
      <p>“No damage was done to the road, but traffic was affected,” she said.</p>
      <p>The Mpumalanga provincial safety, security and liaison spokesman, Mmusi Moeti, said the department condemned the protesters’ actions in the strongest possible terms.</p>
      <p>“The road was heavily backed up, which had economic implications for those transporting perishables and other<br/>goods,” Moeti said.</p>

      <p>He added that, while everyone had a right to embark on protest action, no one had the right to do so by infringing on the rights of others to move freely.</p>
      <p>“Regardless of how genuine their concerns were, the right to protest should not be exercised while infringing on the rights of others.</p>
      <p>“This becomes a massive blow to the economy because certain goods are supposed to reach their destination by a certain time.”</p>
      <p>Hlathi added that cases of looting and public violence were opened. No arrests had been made at the time of going to press.</p>
