      <h1>EMUI 10 with Android 10 rolls out for the Huawei P30 and Mate 20 in Europe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:45:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>At its IFA event in Berlin earlier this year, Huawei <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/emui-10-android-10-update-timeline-huawei-honor/">teased the EMUI 10 update roadmap</a> for a couple of its devices. Soon thereafter, the company <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-adds-20-devices-emui-10-update-roadmap/">released a list of 33 devices</a>, from both Huawei and Honor, that were set to receive the new software update. Staying true to its promise, the company then <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-p30-emui-10-android-q-release/">opened EMUI 10 beta sign-ups</a> for its flagship P30 and P30 Pro early in September. Now, the company is finally rolling out stable builds of EMUI 10 based on Android 10 to the Huawei P30 and Mate 20 devices in Europe.</p>

      <p>The rollout was confirmed by several users on our forums who posted screenshots of the EMUI update on their devices. As per the screenshots, the Huawei P30 is receiving EMUI 10.0.0.168 (C431E22R2P5) which has a package size of 4.42GB. The flagship P30 Pro is also receiving the same build. The Mate 20 Pro, which has <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-mate-20-pro-emui-10-android-update/">previously received</a> an unofficial update for EMUI 10 for some users, is receiving a different build — EMUI 10.0.0.154 (C432E7R1P5). The updates are being pushed over the air to the aforementioned devices, so it might be a while before they reach your handset.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that we haven’t seen any reports of the stable EMUI 10 update for the Mate 20, Mate 20 X or the Porsche Design variant of the device. However, we expect the company to release the update for these devices sometime in the next couple of weeks. There’s also no word on the update for the P30 Lite or the Mate 20 Lite. In case you own one of these devices and have received the update already, make sure to let us know in the comments section below.</p>
