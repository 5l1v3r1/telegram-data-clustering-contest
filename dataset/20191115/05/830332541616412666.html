      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Willie Nelson took the CMA Awards stage for the first time since 2012, joining fellow country star Kacey Musgraves for a rendition of "Rainbow Connection," the song made famous by Kermit the Frog.</p>
      <p>Musgraves and Nelson had previously collaborated on Musgraves' 2015 album, "Pageant Material" and her holiday record, "A Very Kacey Christmas."</p>
      <p>At one point, it appeared as though Nelson, 86, was struggling for breath, but he pulled off the performance.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Nelson had undergone a stem cell procedure for his lungs, saying at the time: "Over the years I've smoked a lot of cigarettes, and I've had emphysema and pneumonia four or five times, so my lungs were really screwed up, and I had heard that this stem-cell operation would be good for them. So I said, 'Well, I'm gonna try it out.'"</p>
      <p>In August, he postponed the tail end of a tour due to breathing issues. He has since recovered and had resumed touring in September.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday night's duet of "Rainbow Connection," Musgraves joined Nelson for the second verse.</p>
      <p>The song is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, debuting as part of "The Muppet Movie" in 1979.</p>
