      <h2>Donna Francis injected silicone she bought off eBay into TV producer Kelly Mayhew's bottom, resulting in the 34-year-old dying from a cardiac arrest - the judge said she had "got away with murder"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:19:03+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:19</time> by <a rel="author">Grainne Cuffe, Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/kelly-ann-mills/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>An American judge said a British beautician 'got away with murder' when jailing her for a year for killing a TV producer in a botched butt lift.</p>
      <p>Donna Francis, 39, gave Kelly Mayhew three injections of silicone she bought off eBay in the basement of her house in New York in May 2015.</p>
      <p>But on the third dose the 34-year-old "turned purple" and immediately went into shock, dying shortly afterwards.</p>
      <p>Part of the extradition deal which saw Francis return to the US from Britain meant she could only be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7687299/Unlicensed-beautician-39-gets-one-year-prison-performing-deadly-butt-injections.html">Mail Online</a>, Judge Kenneth Holder said the phrase 'getting away with murder' applied to Francis as he was sentencing her.</p>
      <p>She wept in court as she was sentenced.</p>
      <p>The judge added: "What (the family) is not getting, in my opinion, is justice. If you have a conscience, this is going to haunt you much longer than the one-year sentence you’re going to serve."</p>

      <p>Latrice, the mother of the victim, who was with her for the procedure, begged Francis for help when her daughter stopped breathing but Francis simply packed up her equipment and fled the scene.</p>
      <p>Kelly's last words to her mum, who also said Francis got away with murder, were 'mommy, hold my hand'.</p>

      <p>The mum and daughter had travelled to see Francis from their home in Maryland, US, and the victim's mother said her daughter had five previous plastic surgeries.</p>
      <p>Emergency services found Kelly unconscious at the home in Mayhew and rushed her to hospital, but she died.</p>
      <p>NYPD detectives got an arrest warrant for Francis a year later and a jury indicted her for "criminally negligent homicide".</p>
      <p>Francis had fled to the UK but was tracked down in London in 2017 by the Met Police, where she was working as a hospital driver.</p>
      <p>Certain types of silicone are banned for cosmetic uses in the United States, but many are still used on the underground market to increase the size of certain body parts, including breasts and bottoms.</p>
