      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:23:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:23</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jefferies, James Brinsford, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jefferies/, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Myles Stephenson has opened up about his nerves on the eve of entering the jungle for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> .</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> winner, who is a singer with R&amp;B group Rak-Su, has admitted that he is starting to feel anxious, especially at the prospect of coming face-to-face with Australia's infamous spiders.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Mirror, Myles said that he has had a 'gentle introduction' to what will come already.</p>
      <p>He said: "I found a cockroach in a pair of my shorts earlier so that scared me out a bit. Obviously I am getting a bit more nervous as we get closer to it.</p>
      <p>"At least it is a baby step into what I am getting into."</p>

      <p>It is his fear of spiders that could be the deciding factor as to whether he can survive the I'm A Celebrity process.</p>
      <p>Myles has a real reason to fear the arachnids as well because he suffered the effects of a false widow spider bite.</p>
      <p>Whereas his mother can handle the eight-legged creatures, Myles said that he is at the opposite end of the scale.</p>
      <p>He continued: I am most scared of spiders, by a long shot. My mum can literally pick them up by her hand. She is fine with them.</p>
      <p>"I have always been scared of them and it got worse.</p>
      <p>"You know those false widows we have back in the UK, I got bitten by one of them a few years ago and it made my arm pretty swollen to since then it has got worse.</p>

      <p>"It attacked me on my shoulder when I was in my bedroom at my mum's house."</p>
      <p>Myles said that his mother's house was often a place where spiders gathered and this is where he was jumped upon by a false widow.</p>
      <p>He continued: "When I used to live at my mum's my bedroom was downstairs and opened out onto the patio so I used to get a build up of spiders there. It just bit me on my shoulder whilst I was playing playstation.</p>

      <p>"I didn't go to hospital but it made my arm pretty puffed up and hard to touch."</p>
      <p>With the size of spiders Down Under a different ball game, Myles joked that they could finish him off.</p>
      <p>He added: "I know there will be bigger ones in Australia, they will eat me!"</p>

      <p>Despite this, Myles has insisted that he will not give up on a trial for the sake of his fear.</p>
      <p>Speaking about what will drive him to complete tasks: "I like to think I won't because I don't like letting the rest of the camp and the family in there down.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't want to go back to camp empty handed. I will do my best and hopefully overcome my fears. I would like to think I will do well."</p>
