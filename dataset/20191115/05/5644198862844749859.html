      <p>REUTERS: A panel of experts to the U.S. FDA on Thursday recommended allowing Amarin Corp Plc's fish-oil derived drug to be used as add-on therapy for reducing the chance of heart attacks and strokes in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>The panel voted 16-0 in favor of expanding approval, potentially opening up a multi-billion dollar opportunity for the company which has only one drug, Vascepa, in the market.</p>

      <p>Vascepa, a highly purified omega-3 fatty acid derived from fish oil, won U.S. approval in 2012 to lower high levels of triglycerides â€” a type of blood fat that can increase the risk of heart disease.</p>
      <p>The Food and Drug Administration is not mandated to follow the recommendation of the panel, but generally does.</p>
