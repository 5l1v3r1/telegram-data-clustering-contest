      <h1>(Video) Keita shows ruthless side with poacher’s goal for Guinea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:50:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>It was overall a good night for Liverpool players on Thursday as Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain found themselves on a winning England side, with the Ox grabbing himself a goal, but he wasn’t the only goal-scoring Red.</p>
      <p>Naby Keita managed to grab himself a goal too, and it showed off his ruthless side. The midfielder is shown trying to penetrate Mali defence.</p>
      <p>The ball ended up bundling though and the midfielder sensed an opportunity to strike – and he pounced on the loose ball.</p>
