      <p>Baker Mayfield didn’t give his teammate a pass.</p>
      <p>After the Browns’ 21-7 win over the Steelers, Mayfield said on Fox that Garrett, who ripped Steelers quarterback <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/">Mason Rudolph’s helmet off </a>and then hit Rudolph over the head with that helmet, has no excuse for what he did.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t see why it started, but it’s inexcusable,” Mayfield said. “I don’t care, rivalry or not, we can’t do that. That’s kind of the history of what’s been going on here lately, hurting yourself, and that’s just endangering the other team.</p>
      <p>“It’s inexcusable, he knows that. I hope he does now. It’s tough. We’ll see.”</p>
      <p>Mayfield said he expects Barrett to get punished by the NFL.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s anything in that moment that I can really say to calm him down,” Mayfield said. “The reality is he’s going to get suspended. We don’t know how long, and that hurts our team. We can’t do that. We can’t continue to hurt this team. It’s inexcusable.”</p>
