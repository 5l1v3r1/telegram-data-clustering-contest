      <h1>Gary Lineker sends message to Tammy Abraham after Chelsea star's first England goal</h1>
      <h2>Three Lions goalscoring legend Lineker predicted Abaraham's debut international goal would be 'first of many' for England</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:27:34+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:27</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Gary Lineker has predicted Tammy Abraham's debut goal for England will be 'the first of many' for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> striker.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tammy-abraham">Abraham</a> scored his first England goal in the Three Lions' 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro which sealed qualification for next summer's Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old had come off the bench just before the hour mark to earn his fourth England cap, and scored the seventh goal for Gareth Southgate's side with six minutes remaining of the Wembley clash.</p>
      <p>Abraham had replaced <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> striker Harry Kane, who scored a hat-trick against Montenegro to move onto 31 goals for England - overtaking Premier League legend Alan Shearer in the all-time list.</p>
      <p>Kane will now have Michael Owen's tally of 40 England goals in his sights - while he has some way to go to catch Lineker, who scored 48 times for the Three Lions and won the Golden Boot in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.</p>

      <p>Despite Kane's heroics, it was Abraham who Lineker congratulated after the match.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "Congratulations to @tammyabraham on his first @England goal. Always a truly special moment. First of many for his country, I suspect."</p>
      <p>Lineker also took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to praise England's youthful team - the youngest in 60 years - backing them to be in the mix for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>He posted: "Well played <a href="https://twitter.com/England">@England</a> . This side is progressing nicely and given the number of talented young players we now have, they’ll only get better. Euros may came a tad early, but 2022 onwards, they’ll be hugely competitive."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> left-back Ben Chilwell provided a hat-trick of assists with Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain and Marcus Rashford joining Kane and Abraham on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>Montenegro defender Aleksander Sofranac put the ball in his own net with 24 minutes left to make it 6-0 before Abraham applied the finishing touch to the victory in England's 1000th game.</p>
