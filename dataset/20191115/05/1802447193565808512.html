      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12133/myles-garrett">Myles Garrett</a> did not seem immediately to grasp exactly how bad his actions were Thursday night.</p>
      <p>No one was talking about the Browns’ victory but about the team’s star defensive player swinging <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13075/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a>‘s helmet at the quarterback’s head.</p>
      <p>“A win’s a win. I don’t think it’s overshadowed by what happened in eight seconds,” Garrett told reporters in the locker room.</p>
      <p>Garrett refused to talk about what set him off. Replays showed that Rudolph tried to rip off Garrett’s helmet before trying to kick him.</p>
      <p>Nothing Rudolph did or said, though, would have excused Garrett’s reaction.</p>
      <p>Officials ejected Garrett; the NFL will suspend him, perhaps for the rest of the season; and his reputation is forever gone.</p>
      <p>Garrett will wear a scarlet letter as a dirty player the rest of his career.</p>
      <p>The former No. 1 overall pick didn’t seem to understand the severity of his actions.</p>
      <p>“I made a mistake; I lost my cool,” Garrett said. “It’s going to come back to hurt our team. The guys who jumped in the scrum, I appreciate my teammates having my back, but it shouldn’t have gotten that far. That’s on me.”</p>
      <p>Garrett said “no clue” when asked how long he expected to be suspended. Here’s a guess: Longer than he expects.</p>
