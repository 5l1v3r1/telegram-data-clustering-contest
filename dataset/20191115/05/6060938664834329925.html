      <h1>World Cup Qualifier: Super-sub's late goal helps India secure draw against Afghanistan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:15:56+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Marcus-Mergulhao-479195787.cms" target="_blank">Marcus Mergulhao</a></address>
      <p>It was all too similar. Conceding a goal, getting the act together, striking back and living to fight another day.</p>
      <p>For the second consecutive game in the FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifier, India left it very late to snatch a point as they held Afghanistan 1-1 at the Republican Central Stadium in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, on Thursday. The visitors seemed to have left themselves with too much to do after conceding a goal at the stroke of half time with Zelfagar Nazary slotting in following a cross for Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Coach Igor Stimac realigned his forces for the second half, introduced all three strikers and Seiminlen (Len) Doungel, the last substitute, headed home the equaliser with just two more minutes of added time left on the clock.</p>

      <p>The point keeps India in the hunt for a place among the top three and qualification to the next stage of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers. India are fourth in the group with three points from three consecutive draws, but with third-placed Afghanistan just a point ahead, it's still in India's hand.</p>
      <p>On a chilly Thursday evening in the capital of Tajikistan, India started well by holding on to the ball, but for the first 45 minutes, the rival goalkeeper had little to do. Ashique Kuruniyan's run with four players dove-tailing him was the most encouraging sight, although he lost control of the ball and gave it away towards the end.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan deservedly took the lead in added time of first session and it came from the exposed left where Mandar Rao Desai and Ashique were repeatedly tested. It was David Ahmed Najem who danced his way on the flank, sent a low cross inside the danger zone and Nazary connected it superbly, straight past a hapless <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gurpreet-Singh-Sandhu">Gurpreet Singh Sandhu</a>.</p>

      <p>Stimac pulled out a defender (Mandar) and introduced a striker (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Farukh-Choudhary">Farukh Choudhary</a>) for the second half. Soon enough there was another frontman, Manvir Singh, was thrown in the thick of things. Close to the hour mark, India bombarded the rival goal with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sunil-chhetri">Sunil Chhetri</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Udanta-Singh">Udanta Singh</a> bringing out flying saves from the Afghan goalkeeper. On one occasion, Chhetri had an open goal in front of him, but his header from handshaking distance brushed the crossbar and sailed over.</p>
      <p>It was not until added time that India got the equaliser, entirely deserving for their efforts. Just like the Bangladesh game, it came late with India pushing everyone forward. It came from a set-piece - <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brandon-Fernandes">Brandon Fernandes</a> again taking the corner - but it was the shortest player in the zone, Doungel, who timed his jump to perfection and headed home, his first for the country.</p>
      <p>India, guided by Stimac, are now unbeaten in two away matches, but still without a win in four games.</p>
