      <p>Alex Rodriguez might want to think twice before picking his next career move.</p>

      <p>The game had the duo getting into character as sportscasters calling a baseball game with a teleprompter feeding them some pretty ridiculous lines.</p>
      <p>“I’m Alex Rodriguez and you can call me little cutie. Wait, juicy fruit booty,” Rodriguez introduced himself.</p>
      <p>“I used to strip down in front of my locker and lick myself,” he said later, trying hard not to crack up. “Clean my little kitty cat and meow, meow, bish,” and “You know, baseball actually reminds me a lot of making love. It’s slow, boring, and you always leave early to beat the traffic.”</p>

      <p>Also on the show, Rodriguez talked about his upcoming wedding to Jennifer Lopez.</p>
      <p>“I would say it’s stressful, but it’s really not,” Rodriguez admitted. “You just let Jennifer plan everything and you just say, ‘Alright.'”</p>
      <p>Rodriguez also warns fans not to expect any kind of choreographed dance from him at his wedding.</p>
      <p>“Anything to do with dance, I kind of just try to take a back seat, she’s a professional dancer,” he joked.</p>
