      <h1>Transfer Rumour: Barcelona keen on Reinier</h1>

      <h3>Reinier is the latest Brazilian prodigy to pique the interest of Barcelona, with the Catalans submitting a request to Flamengo to be made aware of his price tag.</h3>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/elotromundo/actualidad/20191115/471610480606/portada-mundo-deportivo-viernes-15-de-noviembre-de-2019.html">cover page of Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo</a>, Barcelona have submitted a request to Flamengo for Reinier. The Catalans join a number of clubs, including Atletico Madrid in pursuit of the teenage forward and have asked Flamengo for his price tag.</p>
      <p>As per the report from <a href="https://www.espn.com.br/futebol/artigo/_/id/6318461/barcelona-pede-preco-ao-flamengo-por-reinier-diz-jornal-estrela-da-nova-geracao-e-com-perfil-completo">ESPN Brazil</a>, Reinier recently signed a contract extension with Flamengo, one that is set to run till 2024. But, the contract also has a €70 million release clause to protect Flamengo’s investment. Barcelona though, have asked Flamengo for a price, perhaps hinting that the Catalan giants are unwilling to meet the release clause in Reinier’s contract.</p>
      <p>Reinier Jesus Carvalho is a 17-year-old Brazilian attacker who has been hailed as the ‘next generational star’ for Brazil. The forward has a decent return of 4 goals and an assist in 11 league games for Flamengo so far this season and has been gaining plaudits for his performances.</p>
      <p>Reinier Jesus has been drawing a lot of interest since a long time, with Real Madrid previously linked with a move for the Flamengo prospect. Fellow La Liga heavyweights Atletico Madrid and Barcelona though, are primed to battle it out for the 17-year-old.</p>

      <p>Atletico Madrid had advanced negotiations with Reinier and his camp, with reports emerging that they had struck an agreement with the player. But, there have been no reports of an agreement between Flamengo and Atletico Madrid, which means the door is still open for Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The Catalans are hence, prioritising negotiating at a club level first before moving on to Reinier and his camp. The 17-year-old will be looking to emulate the progress that Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo have made thus far in Spain, with Renan Lodi also establishing himself well as a regular at Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>Barcelona will be looking to perhaps, replace Luis Suarez in the long run and Reinier might just be the man. Initially, Reinier could learn the ropes and gain invaluable tips from Suarez and the coaches before taking over from the fellow Latin American in due time.</p>
      <p>€70 million might be too steep of a price for Reinier. But, if Flamengo are willing to deal at a lower price, we could see another Brazilian prodigy make his way to Spain and potentially, take Europe by storm.</p>
