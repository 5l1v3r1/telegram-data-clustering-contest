      <h1>Transfer Rumour: Inter Miami considering shock move for Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric</h1>

      <h3>Real Madrid icon Luka Modric has reportedly been lined up for a switch to the MLS by the David Beckham-owned Inter Miami franchise.</h3>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://us.as.com/us/2019/11/13/futbol/1573605390_337661.html?m1=cG9ydGFkYV9wb3J0YWRh&amp;m2=UmVhbCBNYWRyaWQ%3D&amp;m3=NA%3D%3D&amp;m4=bm9ybWFs&amp;m5=MjI%3D">AS USA</a>, who have cited claims by Eduardo Inda on El Chiringuito, Luka Modric is the subject of interest from the newest franchise in Major League Soccer, jointly-owned by former Real Madrid superstar David Beckham. Inter Miami are interested in signing the Croat, with any move likely to take place in the summer.</p>
      <p>Modric has enjoyed an iconic career since joining Real Madrid from Tottenham in the summer of 2012. Over the last seven years, the veteran midfielder has provided his best years to <i>Los Blancos</i> and played a pivotal years in their dominance in Europe between 2014 and 2018.</p>
      <p>Last year, Modric reached the pinnacle of his career, winning the prestigious Ballon d’Or award in a year where he had led Croatia to the World Cup final. But, since the start of last season, the regression in his game has been visible, which has coincided with Real Madrid’s inconsistent displays in the last 15 months or so.</p>
      <p>The start of the current season has seen Modric being much more improved in his performances, but the loss of pace is still evident, while Zinedine Zidane seems to have started phasing the Croat out of his squad, helped by the advent of Federico Valverde. In fact, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/05/07/transfer-news-real-madrid-boss-zinedine-zidane-prepared-to-let-luka-modric-leave-in-the-summer">reports had suggested that the Real Madrid boss was ready to offload Modric in the summer</a>, before he stayed put at the Bernabeu.</p>

      <p>An exit from Real Madrid, though, could finally happen next summer, with Inter Miami, set to play their first MLS season next year, setting their sights on the 34-year-old, as per Eduardo Inda on his appearance on <a href="https://mega.atresmedia.com/programas/el-chiringuito-de-jugones/">El Chiriguito</a> (h/t AS USA).</p>
      <p>The reputed journalist said, “One of the possible destinations for Luka Modric is the wonderful city of Miami. One of the owners of Inter Miami is very interested in bringing Modric in to play the final years of his career. Real Madrid will let him leave; he’ll be 35 next summer.”</p>
      <p>While the player has also <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/07/17/transfer-rumour-ac-milan-submit-enquiry-to-real-madrid-for-luka-modric">attracted suitors from Serie A previously</a>, a move to the MLS could help him extend his career by a number of years, something that has been indicated most recently by the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic at LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>The new MLS season will begin in March. But, a January switch seems to be out of the question, especially with Zidane being strapped for midfield options this season following Dani Ceballo’s loan move to Arsenal. A summer move, though, could be a possibility, if Inda is to be believed.</p>
      <p>It now remains to be seen if Inter Miami can complete an ambitious move for Luka Modric, should they indeed decide to launch the offensive for him in next summer’s transfer window. For now, it appears to be clear that Modric is on his last legs as a Real Madrid player.</p>
