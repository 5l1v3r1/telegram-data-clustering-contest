      <h1>Here's why Alibaba listing in Hong Kong such a big deal for the city</h1>
      <h2>Alibaba postponed its listing plans over the summer as political protests that began in June worsened</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:01:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Chinese e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/alibaba">Alibaba </a>is set to price its first share sale in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hong-kong">Hong Kong </a>next week, raising up to $13.4 billion in what will be the largest deal in the city since 2010 and the world's biggest ever cross-border secondary listing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHY IS <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/alibaba">ALIBABA </a>LISTING IN <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hong-kong">HONG KONG?</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Analysts say establishing a base outside the United States gives the U.S.-listed company options, especially in the light of the U.S.-China trade dispute.</p>
      <p>It is an "escape valve listing", said Travis Lundy, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors who publishes on SmartKarma.</p>
      <p>"Investors can take delivery or buy and sell shares (in Hong Kong) should U.S.-China relations worsen. This should be considered a non-negligible benefit for any U.S.-listed Chinese company," he added.</p>
      <p>Alibaba, which is due to start trading on November 26 in Hong Kong, could also benefit from Chinese demand.</p>
      <p>While it will not be eligible for trading until June in the Stock Connect that links Shanghai and Shenzhen with Hong Kong, analysts and investors expect demand from mainland mom-and-pop investors to lift its valuation.</p>
      <p>Alibaba's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hong-kong">Hong Kong </a>deal is technically small versus its $476 billion market capitalisation and it will dilute existing shareholder by just 2.8 per cent, the company calculates.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHY NOT LIST IN SHANGHAI OR SHENZHEN?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/alibaba">Alibaba </a>is essentially too big for its home market.</p>
      <p>China hosts the world's No.2 pool of equity capital, but local share sales are usually much smaller than in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>While Alibaba holds the record for the world's biggest initial public offering, with its $25 billion New York listing in 2014 - pipping Hong Kong which hosted Agricultural Bank of China's $22 billion deal in 2010, China's biggest IPO in the past decade was the $7.3 billion float in 2009 of China State Construction Engineering Corp, Refinitiv data shows.</p>
      <p>Beijing is working to help fast-growing start-ups list at home as well as lure back those that got away, including Alibaba. This year it launched the STAR Market to host innovative earlier-stage <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>under a less controlled, more Nasdaq-style listing system - a first for China.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHY IS IT A BIG DEAL FOR HONG KONG?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alibaba postponed its listing plans over the summer as political protests that began in June worsened.</p>
      <p>The company's decision to push ahead now will be seen as a vote of confidence in Hong Kong's financial future even as protests grow increasingly violent.</p>
      <p>The listing is also the culmination of six-plus years of argument, consultations and rule changes that all stemmed from Alibaba's decision in 2013 to list in New York, not Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>That was driven by the city's refusal to ease its one-share-one-vote stance to accept Alibaba's unusual governance, where a self-selecting group of company insiders control the majority of board seats.</p>
      <p>Many market participants felt being able to trade Alibaba alongside arch-rival Tencent would have encouraged other tech <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>to follow suit - rebalancing Hong Kong's reputation for hosting stodgy Chinese state-owned enterprises and local tycoon-controlled conglomerates.</p>
      <p>Last year, bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing pushed through rules that allowed firms to list with different classes of shares, opening a path for tech giants listed elsewhere such as Alibaba to sell shares in the city.</p>
      <p>Alibaba is the first to do so, although others are expected to consider following the same path.</p>
