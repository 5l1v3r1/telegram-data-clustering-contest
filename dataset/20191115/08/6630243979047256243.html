      <p>Nigeria, Niger and Benin have agreed to set up a monitoring committee to tackle smuggling after months of border closure.</p>
      <p>Representatives of the joint anti-smuggling committee, including foreign ministers met in Abuja, Nigeria on Thursday to try to resolve the impasse.</p>
      <p>“The patrol team is to agree on the modality to carry out its operation and recommend a date for the opening of the borders. The delegation of Benin and Niger appealed for the immediate re-opening of the Nigerian borders. In conclusion, the three (3) countries reaffirmed their commitment in enhancing economic integration”, said Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama.</p>

      <p>The committee will comprise naval, customs, immigration and security officials from the three African nations.</p>
      <p>A statement released after the meeting said, the three countries have agreed to meet later this month to recommend opening the borders.</p>
      <p>In August, Africa’s largest economy shuts its borders with Niger and Benin to curb smuggling of rice and other commodities. The decision continues to take a toll on businesses in the affected countries.</p>
