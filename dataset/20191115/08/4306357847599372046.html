      <h3>Arsenal have stepped up their interest in signing Stuttgart midfielder Orel Mangala, according to a report in Germany.</h3>
      <p>Belgian media outlet <i>HLN</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/arsenal-up-interest-in-e30m-rated-belgian-midfielder-chased-by-four">TEAMtalk</a>, is reporting that Arsenal are interested in the 21-year-old Belgian midfielder.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Mangala is valued at around €30m by the Bundesliga 2 club after his impressive season so far.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, the Gunners are facing competition for Mangala from Ligue 1 trio Lyon, Marseille and Lille, as well as Italian giants AS Roma.</p>
      <p>The same report goes on to state that Stuttgart are anticipating an offer from one of Mangala’s European suitors after the Belgian midfielder’s promising start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have a history of signing midfielders from the lower leagues after the Gunners brought in Matteo Guendouzi in a £7m deal from Ligue 1 side Lorient in 2018.</p>
      <p>The French midfielder established himself as a key player under Unai Emery last season after Guendouzi racked up 48 appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Arsenal haven’t won the Premier League title since 2003-04 when Arsene Wenger was still in charge at the north London club.</p>
      <p>Current Gunners boss Emery signed six new players in the summer but Arsenal are still struggling to compete for a top-four finish.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are in sixth spot and eight points behind Manchester City.</p>
