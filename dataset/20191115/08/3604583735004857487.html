      <p>Run by La Vergne Lehmann and Paul Lehmann (Captain Compost) from Grampians Central West Waste and Resource Recovery Group, the workshop will take participants on a recycling journey that begins with household purchasing decisions.</p>
      <p>"Recycling starts from the moment you go shopping," Ms Lehmann said.</p>
      <p>"It is about looking at what you are buying, how you are buying it, and what are your options. You do have options to buy items in recycled or recyclable materials."</p>
      <p>While buying products in packaging made from recyclable materials is a good option, Ms Lehmann said it was important consumers considered avoiding waste in the first place.</p>
      <blockquote>It is getting the eye to see and think about where things are coming from and where they go to.<cite>Paul Lehmann</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Suggestions to reduce household waste include looking at buying in bulk and growing your own fresh food.</p>
      <p>The workshop will also cover the next step of the recycling journey - how to manage waste at home - with discussion on composting food scraps and paper waste.</p>
      <p>Other household recycling focuses include correctly disposing of e-waste for recycling and how to create less waste at Christmas.</p>
      <p>"It is getting the eye to see and think about where things are coming from and where they go to," Mr Lehmann said.</p>
      <p>In addition to hosting the recycling education workshop, Food Is Free also launched new large-scale recycling bins at its Green Space for<a href="https://recyclingnearyou.com.au/nationalrecyclingweek/"> National Recycling Week</a>, where residents can drop off shredded paper and paper materials for compost.</p>
      <p>Food Is Free also accepts egg cartons, toilet paper rolls, glass jars and other items for recycling.</p>
