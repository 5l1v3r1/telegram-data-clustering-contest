      <p>I was 8 years old, it was a warm Spring Day just before school would let out for the Summer Break. I woke up feeling not so good. My stomach hurt really bad and I felt sick. I got out of bed and went into the living room and laid on the couch. My mom thought I was faking sick so I could watch TV all day but I wasn't and as the day went on I hurt more,  my mom kept nitpicking me all day. "You just wait till your Father gets home!" she kept barking. I could not remember if I got up for anything. I know I did not eat, I laid there all day into the night. My father got home in the late evening he worked 12-Hour days. When I was around 10 years old I found out he worked a regular shift then on the way home he stopped off to bang his girlfriend, it kinda sucks finding out your parents are fooling around with others when your young but at 10 years of age I was thinking of killing people so their affairs were really the least of my concerns.</p>
      <p>Dear old Dad came into the living room and told me to get off the couch, I told him I was in pain, he told me to get off the couch again. I was in agony but I did and he says "Let me see where it hurts." I lifted my shirt and showed him my lower right side where it was swollen and red. My mom looked at it in horror she knew something was wrong, my Dad backed up then suddenly drop kicked my stomach. I remember the pain as if something exploded then I passed out. When I came to I was laying on the floor My Uncle, who lived next door was standing there looking down at me with his best friend Zeke, a combat Medic, was home on leave from Vietnam.  Zeke bent down took a look at my stomach and got a real angry look on his face, he got up and punched my Dad right in the face knocking Baldy Locks out cold he then grabbed my Dads car keys picked me up ran me out to the car placed me in the back seat turned the old Buick over and floored it all the way to Saint Margaret's Hospital yelling the whole time. "Stay with me we're almost there!" My stomach was so bad they put me in a little room in the E.R. section on a steel table and removed my burst appendix there. All these years later remembering the room I think it was used for autopsies. I guess that is how ill I was. I woke up 3 days later with my Dad kneeling at my side praying and crying. He begged my forgiveness and swore he would never hit me again. I accepted his apology and forgave him, 6 Months later he beat me up again. That dropkick to my appendix was the worse I ever got it from him. I have never had worse pain in all my life. Had it not been for my Uncle Ricky and his best friend I would have been toast at eight years of age. Zeke is not around anymore he passed away years ago of a heart attack, he should have been added to the names years ago I will add him now. HERE ARE YOUR SCANNER REPORTS.</p>
