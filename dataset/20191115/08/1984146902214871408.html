      <p>Work to transform the former travel shop at Monument Metro station into the country's first underground station pub is set to get under way next month.</p>
      <p>Plans for 'The Waypoint' micropub finally got the thumbs-up from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-council">Newcastle City Council</a> bosses in May this year.</p>
      <p>Since then the site, which has been disused since the travel shop closed in 2015, has remained empty.</p>
      <p>But now Nexus, which runs the Tyne and Wear <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tyne-and-wear-metro">Metro</a>, says it understands contractors are going to start fitting out the former shop next month.</p>
      <p>A Nexus spokesperson said: “We’re really looking forward to getting the new micro pub in at Monument Metro station. We understand that the work to convert our former travel shop into the bar is going to start next month.</p>
      <p>“This development is something different for Metro’s busiest station, in the heart of Newcastle city centre, and we think that Metro passengers will really like it.</p>
      <p>“Micropub projects are already doing well at Monkseaton and Tynemouth Metro stations. Monument is used by ten million passengers a year and is one the busiest in the north of England. It’s a very good location for a venture of this kind.”</p>

      <p>'The Waypoint' will serve a range of local beers, feature screens above the bar to let punters know <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tyne-and-wear-metro">when their train</a> is arriving and feature a grand piano which local musicians will be encouraged to play.</p>
      <p>Sam Beldon, who will manage the pub, says he hopes to generate a "wonderful atmosphere" and a "warm welcome" for commuters heading towards the Metro after a hard day's work.</p>
      <p>He added: "I think it is going to be the best place in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> to pop in for a pint on your way home from work. I can't think of anything better, it's right in the centre where you need it."</p>
      <p>Visions of transforming the site into a new underground bar were first unveiled last year, but were held up as local authority officials debated whether to grant an alcohol licence for the venue.</p>
      <p>When civic centre officials granted planning permission for the redevelopment last December, they said it would "benefit the viability and vitality of the Metro concourse area as an important arrival point to the city".</p>
