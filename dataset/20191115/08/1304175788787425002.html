      <h4>The most since 2005; INRIX predicts record delays on Wednesday.<br/> </h4>
      <p>ORLANDO, FLA. – More than 55 million travelers are making plans to kick off the holiday season with a trip of 50 miles or more away from home this Thanksgiving. This will be the second-highest Thanksgiving travel volume since <b>AAA</b> began tracking in 2000, trailing only the record set in 2005. Overall, an additional 1.6 million more people will travel compared with last year, a 2.9% increase. The vast majority of holiday travelers will drive to their destinations and, INRIX, a global transportation analytics company, expects Wednesday afternoon to be the worst travel period nationally, with trips taking as much at four times longer than normal in major metros.</p>
      <p>“<i>Millions of thankful Americans are starting the holiday season off right with a Thanksgiving getaway</i>,” said <b>Paula Twidale</b>, vice president, AAA Travel. “<i>Strong economic fundamentals are motivating Americans to venture out this holiday in near-record numbers. Consumer spending remains strong, thanks to increasing wages, disposable income and household wealth, and travel remains one of their top priorities for the holiday season</i>.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>By the numbers: 2019 Thanksgiving travel forecast</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automobiles: 49.3 million travelers will hit the road this Thanksgiving, the most since 2005 and 2.8% more than last year.</li>
        <li>Planes: With 4.6% growth, air travel will see the biggest increase in travel volume during the Thanksgiving holiday, with 4.45 million Americans expected to fly.</li>
        <li>Trains, Buses and Cruise Ships: Travel by other modes will reach 1.49 million, a slight increase of 1.4% from 2018.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Nothing worse than Wednesday: Times NOT to be on the road</b><br/>For the 49.3 million Americans traveling by automobile, INRIX, in collaboration with AAA, predicts major delays throughout the week, peaking Wednesday with trips taking as much four times longer as commuters mix with travelers.</p>
      <p>“<i>With record levels of travelers, and persistent population growth in the country’s major metropolitan areas, drivers must prepare for major delays</i>,” said<b> Trevor Reed</b>, transportation analyst at INRIX. “<i>Although travel times will peak on Wednesday afternoon nationally, travelers should expect much heavier than normal congestion throughout the week.</i>”</p>

        <b>Lower gas prices fuel road trips; AAA to rescue more than 368,000</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gas prices have been fluctuating as of late, but are currently cheaper than the national average at this time last year, giving Americans a little extra money to spend on travel and motivating millions to take road trips. For the majority of Americans, AAA expects gas prices to be fairly similar to last year's Thanksgiving holiday, which averaged $2.57.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, more than 368,000 motorists will call AAA for assistance at the roadside this Thanksgiving holiday. Dead batteries, flat tires and lockouts will be the leading reasons AAA members will experience car trouble. AAA recommends motorists take their vehicles to a trusted repair facility to perform any needed maintenance before heading out on a road trip. And remember to slow down and move over for stopped emergency vehicles at the roadside.</p>
      <p><b>Travel tip for the friendly skies: Fly Monday before Thanksgiving</b><br/>A recent analysis of AAA’s flight booking data from the last three years revealed that flying the Monday before the Thanksgiving travel rush is the best option for travelers. It has the lowest average ticket price ($486) prior to the holiday and is a lighter travel day than later in the week. Travelers can also save by traveling on Thanksgiving Day, which has the week’s lowest average price per ticket ($454).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Car rental costs peak, hotel prices mixed</b>
      </p>
      <p>Holiday road trippers should budget more for a rental car this year, which have reached their highest prices on record for the Thanksgiving holiday (since 1999), at $75 per day. Travelers will also pay a bit more at AAA Two Diamond hotels, where prices are 1% more than last year, or $125 per night. Conversely, the average rate for AAA Three Diamond hotels has fallen 5% to an average nightly cost of $158.</p>
      <p><b>Warm weather beckons this Thanksgiving</b><br/>The theme parks of Orlando and southern California, and other warm-weather destinations will see an influx of travelers looking to escape the start of winter. Florida is home to four of the top 10 destinations, and Hawaii twice graces the list of top destinations in the U.S. this Thanksgiving, based on advance AAA Travel bookings:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Orlando, Florida</li>
        <li>Anaheim, California</li>
        <li>New York, New York</li>
