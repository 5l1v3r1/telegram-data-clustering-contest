      <p>BEIJING -- Chinese tech giant Huawei is selling a folding smartphone without Google apps or U.S.-made processor chips following sanctions imposed by Washington.</p>
      <p>The Mate X went on sale Friday on Huawei's online store in China priced at 16,999 yuan (US$2,422) and competes with Samsung's Galaxy Fold launched in September.</p>
      <p>Huawei Technologies Ltd. is scrambling to preserve its business following U.S. controls imposed in May on sales of American components and technology to the company, which Washington says is a security risk.</p>
      <p>The Mate X uses Huawei's Kirin 980 and Balong 5000 chipset and Chinese alternatives to Google music, maps and other services.</p>
      <p>Huawei has yet to announce plans for sales outside China.</p>
