      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14699"/>Powered by custom-tuned 50mm drivers that produce a more natural sound curve, the realistic and immersive soundscape captures every auditory detail, allowing users to pick up even the slightest nuance in sound and use it to their advantage. </p>
      <p>The Kraken Ultimate’s active noise canceling microphone allows for crystal-clear team communication completing a winning combination that gives gamers a competitive edge and the definitive gaming audio experience.</p>
      <p>The Razer Kraken Ultimate comes equipped with THX® Spatial Audio technology – an advanced positional audio solution that delivers pinpoint accuracy and greater than 7.1 surround sound. Producing sound in a 360-degree sphere allows for better awareness and heightened immersion during competitive gameplay, allowing you to locate sneaking enemies, avoid whizzing bullets, and detect nearby threats before anyone else. THX Spatial Audio optimizes the unique sound design and engineering of every game and delivers a natural listening experience by adjusting its virtual speakers to match the audio source’s actual distance and location in-game. This can help to reduce brain and ear fatigue, as users are able to decipher where every sound is coming from instinctively, letting them stay focused longer – giving them the upper hand. Featuring custom-tuned 50mm drivers, the Razer Kraken Ultimate produces powerful, detailed, super-clear sound and punchy base. Tuned to deliver a more natural sound curve, the resulting audio is the richest, most immersive, and lifelike within the Kraken line – perfectly capturing every auditory detail, such as footsteps and gunshots, for a competitive advantage.</p>
      <p>Team chat is essential to any multi-player game, and with the new Discord-certified, active noise canceling microphone on the Kraken Ultimate, gamers can be assured of flawless team communication, even at crowded tournaments. Competitive gaming headsets rely on the ability to chat clearly and discern even the subtlest sounds moment-to-moment. By adding active noise canceling technology, the Razer Kraken Ultimate’s highly-tuned mic detects and nullifies background noise as you speak, making your voice even clearer, and ensuring crystal-clear communication between teammates.</p>
      <p>The Kraken Ultimate features aluminum and steel construction with cooling gel-infused ear cushions for lightweight durability and long-lasting comfort. Being both flexible and tough, its ultra-soft padded headband with bauxite aluminum frame is well-equipped to handle the rigors of transport and extensive gaming sessions. Cooling-gel cushions help reduce heat build-up and also contain hidden eyewear channels for gamers sporting corrective or guru blue-light glasses. The Kraken Ultimate also features highly visible backlit earcups powered by Razer Chroma, supporting 16.8 million colors and a suite of lighting effects controlled from within Razer Synapse 3, for endless customization possibilities.</p>
      <p>Razer also introduces today the Kraken X USB. The newest addition to the Kraken X family offers green earcup lighting and 7.1 virtual surround sound via its USB connection – all in a 275g lightweight design, for all-day gaming comfort and immersion.</p>
