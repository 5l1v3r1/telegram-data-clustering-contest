      <h1>Eddie Stobart agrees £55m rescue deal as losses mount up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:46:43+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Searles</a></address>
      <p>Eddie Stobart has issued a warning to shareholders that its expected losses for the six months ending 31 May stand at more than £12m.</p>
      <p>The British haulier delayed the publication of its results after undertaking a review of its accounts following the discovery of a £2m error in its 2018 results.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares were suspended in August as a result.</p>

      <p>In its latest update, Eddie Stobart said it was continuing to prepare its half-year results but warned investors it expected a loss of at least £12m.</p>
      <p>It added that “shareholders should note that losses could be higher”.</p>
      <p>These losses combined with “poor cash collection” and dividends paid out means Eddie Stobart is expecting its debt to stand at £200m by the end of the year, “which the board considers to be an unsustainable level”.</p>
      <h3>Takeover</h3>
      <p>Subsequently, a deal to sell Eddie Stobart to the Douglas Bay Capital Fund has been conditionally agreed.</p>
      <p>Dbay, which already owned a stake in the company, has made a £55m offer to take a 51 per cent majority share.</p>
      <p>“As part of the Proposal, the Fund would (directly or indirectly) inject approximately £55m of financing into the group’s operations through a PIK loan instrument, which will be used to provide necessary liquidity,” Eddie Stobart’s board noted.</p>
      <p>Existing investors’ own shares would be turned into parts of a 49 per cent stake in the holding company, Stobart said.</p>
      <p>The proposed takeover is subject to shareholder approval, with a general meeting scheduled for around 2 December.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the announcement, chief executive Sebastien Desreumaux said a thorough review had reaffirmed his belief the company “is anchored by strong underlying fundamentals with significant potential for the future”.</p>

      <p>“During the course of the year we have secured a number of customer wins and extensions, and in particular I am pleased to announce that our contract with Tesco has recently been renewed for a further 12 months up to March 2021.”</p>
      <p>He said the proposed takeover by Dbay would give Stobart a “stable footing” for growth.</p>
      <p>A Dbay spokesperson said: “Given the difficult circumstances, our proposal is a realistic chance to secure value for all shareholders and safeguard jobs for Eddie Stobart’s employees. This is a significant investment for Dbay, reflecting our belief in the Company.</p>
      <p>“Our team has delivered this sort of turnaround before and it is vital that significant action is taken to rescue the Company before the busy Christmas trading period.”</p>
