      <p>In her 67 years on the throne as British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II has embarked on many travels to African states and as Head of the Commonwealth – made up of 53 sovereign states including African countries – she has given and received thousands of gifts.</p>
      <p>While some of these gifts are ordinary, others proved themselves to be colourful and damn right curious.</p>
      <p>The sheer numbers of the gifts inspired an exhibition from July 22 through to October 1, 2017 at the Buckingham Palace called “Royal Gifts.”</p>
      <p>According to Sally Goodsir, Exhibition Curator at the Royal Collection Trust, the objects displayed had been seen by the queen and approved.</p>
      <p><b>Face2Face Africa</b> looks at four curious or rather interesting gifts Queen Elizabeth II has received from African leaders and others from the African stock.</p>
