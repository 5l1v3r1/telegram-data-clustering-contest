      <h1>Mum's heartbreaking 'last fight' to make her dying son smile</h1>
      <h2>'This is the last thing I can do for him'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:02:44+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author">Claire Harrison, Victoria Jones</a></address>
      <p>Charlotte Nixon has been told by specialists that her her terminally-ill son, Bailey, does not have long to live.</p>
      <p>Now, she is on a mission to simply put a smile on her eight-year-old son's face.</p>
      <p>In his final days, Charlotte wants to give her son 'music therapy' from the family home, <a href="https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/mums-heartbreaking-bid-put-smile-17246394">Coventry Live report.</a></p>
      <p>She says that while she is now "helpless" this "is the last thing" she can do for him.</p>
      <p>"Bailey has always loved music and responded so well to it, he had the most infectious laugh when hearing music and his right leg would always bounce to the beat," the mum-of-two from Nuneaton explained.</p>
      <p>"Bailey now cannot be moved out of the house due to his deterioration so he would need 'music therapy' at home. He loves the sound of a guitar and some gentle singing.</p>
      <p>"He has his own team of very experienced professionals who are now all on standby any day for him to gain his angels wings.</p>
      <p>"As a mum I am completely helpless and there is nothing more I can do for him however, knowing how much he loves music this is the last thing I can do for him.</p>
      <p>"Bailey is my life, my world and everything that I am and my heart is breaking so bad right now but I have one last fight to make sure my boy leaves this earth with a smile on his face."</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old has asked if any musicians can spare any time to come and play for him - even if it is just an hour.</p>
      <p>This appeal has already seen musicians step forward, to offer their time for free for Bailey, who was born with a life-limiting brain condition which has led to Epilepsy, severe gut issues, dystonia and global developmental delay.</p>
      <p>In a post on Facebook, the The Love Rats Acoustic Duo posted a message calling out to fellow performers to help the family.</p>
      <p>"I cant imagine what this poor family is going through," it read.</p>
      <p>"To save her money she really shouldn't be worrying about spending, I said I would write a post asking if any other musicians would be willing to gift an hour of their time to pop over to their home in Nuneaton and perform for this little boy who loves music.</p>
      <p>"If we went over on different days then Bailey would enjoy a magical variety of music."</p>
      <p>It concludes: "As we know, music is so powerful and is something that can be felt even when words cant be spoken. It's a glimmer of light in the darkness."</p>
      <p>Any bands or musicians who can help are being urged to contact Charlotte Nixon via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/charlotte.nixon.14">Facebook.</a></p>
