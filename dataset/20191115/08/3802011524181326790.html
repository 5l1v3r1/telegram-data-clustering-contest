      <p>At least 18 civilians and a paramilitary policeman have been killed since October 14. Dozens of people have been wounded and dozens more arrested.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, a sea of people draped in red — the colour of the opposition — flooded the streets of the seaside capital, a day after Conde confirmed that parliamentary elections will be held in February.</p>
      <p>Clashes erupted when the demonstrators tried to deviate from the route sanctioned by authorities.</p>
      <p>AFP correspondents said police then fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd.</p>
      <p>The security ministry said the action came after the demonstrators threw stones at the police.</p>
      <p>Police used water cannon and a bus was torched during the clashes, images from the scene showed.</p>
      <p>Trouble erupted in several outlying areas of the city and explosions were heard.</p>
      <p>The latest demonstration came a day after rights group Amnesty International said there were “red lights” flashing in respect to human rights and denounced “massive” and “arbitrary” arrests in the country.</p>
      <p>Aminatou Bah, a woman taking part in the Conakry demonstrations said: “We aren’t asking Mr Conde for a lot.”</p>
      <p>“We are asking him to drop this diabolical project (of seeking a third term), free prisoners and stop killing Guineans,” she said. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7686871/Guinean-teen-shot-dead-mass-anti-government-protests.html"><b>AFP</b></a></p>
