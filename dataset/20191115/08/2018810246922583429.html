      <p>Microsoft's X019 conference is basically like a mini E3, so it's no surprise that Xbox Game Pass would get a ton of new stuff to announce. From today, Xbox Game Pass will have <i>RAGE 2</i>, <i>Remnant: From The Ashes</i>, <i>The Talos Principle</i> and <i>Hearts of Iron 4</i>, and later this year it'll get <i>The Witcher 3</i>, <i>Darksiders 3</i>, the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series, and more.</p>
      <p>If you're just playing on Xbox, later today you'll be able to download <i>Age of Wonders: Planetfall, LEGO: The Ninjago Movie, RAGE 2, Remnant From the Ashes, The Talos Principle</i> and <i>Tracks</i>. PC subscribers will get <i>Age of Empires 2</i> and <i>Hearts of Iron 4</i> exclusively as well, with PC versions of <i>Age of Wonders: Planetfall</i> and <i>RAGE 2</i> to come later.</p>
      <p>And before the end of the year, Game Pass will get Geralt's magnus opus, <i>Darksiders 3</i>, <i>Life is Strange 2</i>, <i>Halo Reach</i> and more:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Witcher 3 (Xbox only)</li>
        <li>Halo Reach (Xbox + PC)</li>
        <li>My Friend Pedro (Xbox + PC)</li>
        <li>Life is Strange 2 (Xbox only)</li>
        <li>Darksiders 3 (Xbox + PC)</li>
        <li>The Escapists 2 (Xbox + PC)</li>
        <li>The Red Strings Club (PC)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, it wouldn't be a subscription service if games weren't pulled from the platform: <i>ABZU</i>, <i>GRID 2</i>, <i>Below</i>, <i>Football Manager 2019</i> and <i>Strange Brigade</i> are all leaving Game Pass from today.</p>
