      <p><i>Age of Empires 4</i> has been in the works for ages. Here's what it finally looks like.</p>
      <p>The gameplay was announced during the X019 conference, where Xbox's Shannon Loftis announced that the game would be set in the Medievil era. The game was officially announced in 2017, when Relic Entertainment was the lead developer. Microsoft have since established a new studio just to focus on <i>Age of Empires</i>, called World's Edge.</p>
      <p>As a final aside, the two factions in the gameplay were the Mongols and the English. Neither faction is new for the <i>AoE</i> franchise, both of which were in the original <i>AoE 2</i> (the latter as the Britons).</p>
