      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:54:50+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:54</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor's coach has revealed the Irishman is in "phenomenal shape" ahead of his return to the UFC.</p>
      <p>The Irishman is expected to take on Donald Cerrone on January 18 having not fought since he was choked out by Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>And his striking coach Owen Roddy is confident McGregor will be back as good as ever.</p>
      <p>"I know he’s working very hard," <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/owen-roddy-in-conor-mcgregor-corner-donald-cowboy-cerrone-ufc-246?taid=5dce6233f2edda0001e9e47d&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">he told MMA Junkie</a> . "There’s no official date set yet, but Conor’s been training very hard, as you can see - he’s in good nick.</p>
      <p>"If you're looking at any of the pictures, he's in phenomenal shape, he’s ready to go. I’m sure everybody’s excited to see him back.</p>

      <p>"If it is 'Cowboy', it would be an exciting fight. I said this a couple of months ago: 'Cowboy' and Conor is a great fight for the fans.</p>
      <p>"Two guys that are exciting strikers – although ‘Cowboy’ is phenomenal on the ground, as well, but I think if it was a fight between them, it would be a striking battle, and I think it would be one for the fans, so if it is that, it’ll be an exciting one.</p>
      <p>"I just want to see Conor back in. I think everybody just wants to see Conor back in the UFC, bring back that spectacle that is his fights.</p>

      <p>"Nobody does it like Conor, and for me, I just want to see him back in there. Whatever happens after that, who knows?"</p>
      <p>McGregor wants to fight three times next year - against Cerrone, Jorge Masvidal and finally Khabib Nurmagomedov for a second time.</p>
      <p>And Roddy is confident his man would produce a better showing in a rematch.</p>
      <p>"It was a tricky fight, and take nothing away from Khabib, he came in with a great gameplan," he added. "He got off, and he executed. but I just don’t think Conor was anywhere near the best of his ability.</p>
      <p>"He wasn’t as good as he can be, and Conor on a night, at 100 per cent, can beat anybody in the world."</p>
