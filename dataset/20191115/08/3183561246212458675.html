      <p>Disney+ launched in a small handful of regions this week, and while everyone else waits for it to drop, they've turned to piracy.</p>
      <p><i>The Mandalorian</i> is one of the shows available on the platform, arriving in Australia on November 19 along with the new service itself, but it seems that a combination of not wanting to wait for it to arrive (or not wanting to pay the monthly subscription cost, for those with access to it), has lead to the show has become the most pirated TV show of the last few days, with hundreds of thousands downloads and streams.</p>
      <p>Getting the series up on piracy sites hasn't proven to be to much of a challenge - Disney uses Widevine DRM, which has <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/disney-plus-devices-widevine">seemingly caused some issues for users on particular devices</a>. And regardless of your thoughts on piracy, it was bound to happen given the months of waiting time due to the staggered launch of the service.</p>

      <p>Disney has tried to keep the pirates in check to some degree, sending out takedown requests in an effort to nip it in the bud, but we'll see how effective that is.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, why not watch <i>The Mandalorian</i>'s cast and crew describe the first season in their own words â€“ without spoilers.</p>
