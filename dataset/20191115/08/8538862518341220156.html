      <p>How long is <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/star_wars_jedi_fallen_order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>? The latest <i>Star Wars</i> video game is a single-player experience, boasting its own story, characters, and, obviously, light saber duels. It goes without saying that <i>Star Wars</i> is an immensely popular franchise and its influence stretches far beyond the realm of hardcore gaming. As such, you may be wondering whether you'll be able to beat Star Wars Jedi over the course of a weekend, or smash through it in just a handful of sittings. In this guide, we'll break down the game's structure and provide estimates on how long it'll take to complete depending on the kind of player that you are.</p>
      <h3>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order - How long is it?</h3>
      <p>Star Wars Jedi takes place across multiple different planets, but it's important to note that these planets are not open world. That said, the locations on these planets aren't strictly linear, either. The environments in Fallen Order may seem straightforward at first glance, but there are a lot of secrets to find, and you can return to previous areas later in the game in order to open up parts of the map that were not accessible when you first visited.</p>
      <p>The structure of the game is a bit like <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/god_of_war">God of War (2018)</a>, and perhaps a little similar to something like <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/dark_souls_iii">Dark Souls</a>. You can, of course, sprint from one end of the map to the other and focus on nothing but the story if you really want to, but you'll be missing out on a lot of secrets and opportunities to make main character Cal more powerful.</p>
      <p>Before we move on, it's also worth mentioning that Star Wars Jedi can be quite a difficult game. Even on the standard difficulty setting (Jedi Knight), certain fights can be especially tricky, and there's quite a lot to learn when it comes to combat. As such, playing on harder difficulties may extend your playtime by a significant amount. Conversely, if you're only really interested in the story, playing on the game's easiest difficulty setting will likely shave off a lot of time.</p>
      <h4>Star Wars Jedi length</h4>
      <p>Below, you'll find estimates for how long it takes to complete Star Wars Jedi depending on how much of the game you want to see.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Complete playthrough (finish story, find all secrets, unlock as many skills as possible):</b> <b>30</b><b>+ hours</b><br/>Star Wars Jedi is not an especially short game to begin with, but if you want to see and do everything that it has to offer, then you could be looking at a playtime of up to and over 30 hours.</li>
        <li><b>Mostly complete playthrough (finish story, attempt most side content): Around 20-25 hours<br/></b>If you're looking to complete the story and see <i>most</i> of what Star Wars Jedi has to offer, you're probably looking at 20-25 hours or thereabouts. Most players are likely going to end up in this range.</li>
        <li><b>Story only playthrough (concentrate only on completing the story): Around 10-15 hours<br/></b>By focusing solely on the story, you can probably finish Star Wars Jedi in 10 hours or so, but you'd have to rush it. As such, most story-focused players are probably going to take a little longer to cross the finish line at around 15 hours.</li>
      </ul>
