      <p>A coke stash hidden in the woods by suspected drug dealers was destroyed by boars, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/italy-drug-bust-wild-boar-hidden-cocaine-destroyed-smuggling-operation-1471472?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter&amp;utm_medium=Social">report police in Tuscany</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>The drug stash was hidden in a forest area in the Valdichiana valley. The law enforcement probe, which spanned between September 2018 and March 2019, discovered one of the gang members was allegedly distributing drugs via a nightclub in Arezzo.<br/><br/>The suspects traded approximately two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of cocaine every month, which netted the gang the equivalent of between $90 and $120 per gram, Il Tirreno reported. An unknown number of boars allegedly dug up and destroyed the gang's packages, dispersing their contents in the woods.<br/><br/>It was not immediately known what happened to the curious animals.</blockquote>
