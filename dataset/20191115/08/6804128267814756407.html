      <h1>Gary Lineker makes big prediction about Chelsea star Tammy Abraham after his first England goal</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea striker scored his first England goal as the Three Lions thrashed Montenegro at Wembley</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:58:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:58</time> by <a rel="author">James Findlater</a></address>
      <p>Tammy Abraham’s maiden goal for England will be the “first of many” for the Chelsea striker, Gary Lineker has predicted.</p>
      <p>Abraham came off the bench to score his first goal for England during last night’s 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions secured their qualification for next summer’s Euro 2020 finals with ease as <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham’s</a> Harry Kane scored a hat-trick at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Abraham came on as a second half substitute for the England skipper – who overtook Alan Shearer to sit fifth on the all-time England goals list on 31 – and marked his fourth appearance for the national team in style.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old latched on to Jadon Sancho’s ball across the face of goal to tuck away his first England strike.</p>
      <p>And the <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> striker was congratulated by Lineker, who sits third on the all-time leading scorers’ list, and expects big things from Abraham.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "Congratulations to @tammyabraham on his first @England goal. Always a truly special moment. First of many for his country, I suspect."</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring on his return for England, with Marcus Rashford also on the scoresheet as the Three Lions ran riot in the first half at Wembley.</p>
      <p>And Lineker was also full of praise for Gareth Southgate’s youthful side – England’s youngest in 60 years – and backed them to have a say in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>

      <p>He posted: "Well played @England. This side is progressing nicely and given the number of talented young players we now have, they’ll only get better. Euros may came a tad early, but 2022 onwards, they’ll be hugely competitive."</p>
