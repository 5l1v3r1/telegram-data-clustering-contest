      <p>Last month, The Killers teased the follow-up to 2017’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/killers-wonderful-wonderful-review-2">Wonderful, Wonderful’</a> by <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-killers-tease-new-album-with-list-of-potential-song-titles-2555343">sharing a list of potential track names</a>. Names such as ‘Blowback’, ‘Party People’, ‘When Dreams Run Dry’, ‘Dying Breed’, ‘Caution’ and ‘Man + Woman’ were all accompanied by large ticks – a possible indication that they will feature on the finished record. Other track titles featured on the list include ‘Spirit of Mystery’, ‘My God’, ‘Running Towards’, ‘Fire + Bone’, ‘Just Can’t Quit’ and ‘Mirage C’est La Vie’.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been in Utah doing it,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/the-killers-brandon-flowers-exclusively-talks-to-us-about-their-next-album-and-unfinished-business-at-glastonbury-2470416">Flowers told <i>NME</i> earlier this year about the new album</a>. “That’s where I fell in love with music for the first time; so it’s interesting to be there again and hear some of that music with the geography matching the sensation.</p>
      <p>“Some of that stuff is starting to resurface and a lot of that had to do with synthesiser music. It’s always been part of our DNA but it’s definitely creeping up.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/big-read-killers-road-glastonbury-redemption">Speaking to <i>NME</i> just before Glastonbury</a>, drummer Ronnie Vannucci Jr added: “I wouldn’t call this a concept album, but we’re starting to see the threads of a concept, and we’re having fun with it. I don’t wanna say for sure what the concept is, but I’d say this is more fun, a little bit more up and I love that. I like dark records too. It’s just been Brandon and I… we’ve been having fun with the fact that we don’t have our guitar player, we don’t have our bass player with us, so it sounds different.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “There are messages still but it’s a little bit more fun and grateful sounding. Grateful for where we are. There are tons of bands and musicians in this place and we are very grateful for being a band nearly twenty years in, making records. We’re not taking it for granted and this record sounds like that.”</p>
