      <p>LONDON, 15 — Personal data reveals a slew of secrets about friends and family so regulators should stop fixating on individual privacy and safeguard society instead, data experts said yesterday.</p>
      <p>From friends’ shopping habits to family health, one person’s data can shed light on a far wider network, with tech firms using individual information to make assumptions about many others, digital rights experts told a conference in London.</p>
      <p>“The sum of our individual privacies won’t add up to the collective privacy of society,” said Martin Tisne, managing director of philanthropic organisation Luminate.</p>
      <p>Glen Weyl, an economist at the research arm of US tech giant Microsoft, agreed, citing citizens who consent to the use of their health data for research or commercial purpose.</p>
      <p>“That says things about your whole family because your conditions speak to the conditions of your family... (and they) may now face different insurance premiums based on a decision that you made,” he said.</p>
      <p>Tech giants, once seen as engines of economic growth and a source of innovation, have faced allegations on both sides of the Atlantic of misusing power and failing to protect users’ privacy.</p>
      <p>According to industry estimates, more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are generated each day, roughly the equivalent of 625 billion iTunes songs.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the European Union enacted one of the biggest shake-ups of data privacy laws since the birth of the web, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gave people more control over their online information.</p>
      <p>Websites, for example, now have to ask users for consent before processing their data.</p>
      <p>While this was a “great foundation” to protect privacy, it failed to guarantee “collective rights over data”, Tisne told the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s annual Trust Conference.</p>
      <p>“GDPR is the ghost of data protection’s past, it’s focused on a very individualised notion of privacy,” he said. “But the world we live in now isn’t like that, it’s not just about me and my credit-card company.”</p>
      <p>He cited as an example a group of 10 friends going to a disreputable bar with only one disclosing their whereabouts.</p>
      <p>“Even if nine of us don’t release that data, one person may allow their data to be released and that’s it for all of us.”</p>
      <p>Weyl wants people to form “data unions” to demand payment for their data and help address privacy concerns by restricting what information is collected and how it is used.</p>
      <p>“Too often people see ethics as the party pooper, as shutting things down,” said Weyl, who founded RadicalxChange, a network of entrepreneurs, activists and researchers promoting social change.</p>
      <p>“We need a society that treats people as agents rather than passive subjects in a surveillance state.” — Thomson Reuters Foundation</p>
