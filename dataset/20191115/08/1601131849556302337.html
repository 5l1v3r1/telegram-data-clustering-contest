      <h1>Samsung Android 10 release nears as One UI 2.0 beta closed in Korea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:58:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:58</time> by <a rel="author">Adnan F.</a></address>
      <p>Exactly a month after <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s10-android-10-one-ui-2-0-beta-officially-starts-today/">launching the Galaxy S10 Android 10 One UI 2.0 beta program</a>, Samsung has closed beta registrations in South Korea. It has only done that for the Galaxy S10, though, as beta registrations for the Galaxy Note 10 are still being accepted.</p>
      <p>South Korea was the first market where Samsung launched the One UI 2.0 beta and later expanded it to more markets. So it’s entirely possible that we’ll see beta registrations being closed in other markets as well in the coming days.</p>
      <h3>Things are looking up for the official Samsung Android 10 release</h3>
      <p>Samsung released the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/third-android-10-beta-update-released-for-the-galaxy-s10-series/">third beta firmware for the Galaxy S10 series</a> just last week. It closed registrations for the beta at midnight on November 14. Galaxy S10 owners in South Korea will no longer be able to sign up for the beta program.</p>
      <p>Just because it has closed the One UI 2.0 beta doesn’t mean that Samsung may not release additional beta firmware. It has likely filled up all the spots and doesn’t feel the need to expand the program to more users.</p>
      <p>It’s also an indication that the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/one-ui-2-0/">One UI 2.0 beta program</a> has been progressing nicely. The Galaxy S10 series will certainly be the first to get the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/android-10-update">official Samsung Android 10 release</a>. The company hasn’t confirmed as yet when it intends to do that. However, it’s not going to be long now before it finally starts rolling out the stable version.</p>
      <p>There’s an expectation that Samsung will be able to do this before the end of this year. It did release Android Pie over the holidays last year. So keep your fingers crossed, we just might be in for another Christmas miracle.</p>
