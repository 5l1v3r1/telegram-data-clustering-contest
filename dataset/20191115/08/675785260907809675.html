      <h1>Boris Johnson wants you to forget his past crimes</h1>
      <h2>The Prime Minister is trying to present himself as a fresh start who has no responsibility for what the Conservatives have done in office</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:57:58+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:57</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Beattie, https://www.facebook.com/Jason-Beattie-148163672552769/</a></address>
      <p>The greatest (con?) trick Boris Johnson is trying to pull at this election is to pose as the insurgent candidate. <br/><br/>The Prime Minister is trying to convince voters he has arrived on the scene just in the nick of time  <a href="http://email.trinitymirror-news.co.uk/In/231291190/0/waboa7~e9Ig1sN7L_g7ot2m7g9IRCO4lMGaM2XMF7CF/">to fix all the problems with the country</a> . <br/><br/>This relies on them suffering a collective amnesia over the fact he has been an MP and a member of the Government during the last nine years of Conservative rule. <br/><br/>Johnson wants you to think he bears no responsibility for the bedroom tax, the cuts to public services, the universal credit, lack of affordable homes,  <a href="http://email.trinitymirror-news.co.uk/In/231291191/0/waboa7~e9Ig1sN7L_g7ot2m7g9IRCO4lMGaM2XMF7CF/">the underfunding of the NHS</a>  and the shortfall in police numbers, all of which he voted for. <br/><br/>This year zero approach is applied with particular emphasis to Brexit.</p>

      <p>To listen to the Prime Minister you would not think he was either responsible for Brexit or in any way culpable for the inability to resolve the issue. <br/><br/>His claim to want to get Brexit done is akin to someone who drunkenly smashes a car into a wall and then claim he is the only person who is sober enough to drive the courtesy vehicle. <br/><br/>This line may work in some quarters.  <br/><br/>Many voters for some reason do not associate Johnson with the inability to deliver Brexit or the years of Tory austerity. <br/><br/>The problem is that many other voters are now  <a href="http://email.trinitymirror-news.co.uk/In/231291192/0/waboa7~e9Ig1sN7L_g7ot2m7g9IRCO4lMGaM2XMF7CF/">witnessing the effect of nearly a decade of underfunding</a>  and are less willing to accept Johnson is somehow a break with the past.</p>

      <p>Labour’s big policy announcement today  <a href="http://email.trinitymirror-news.co.uk/In/231291193/0/waboa7~e9Ig1sN7L_g7ot2m7g9IRCO4lMGaM2XMF7CF/">is the nationalisation of broadband.</a> <br/><br/>In 1983 the Labour manifesto promised a national cable system delivered by a publicly-owned British Telecommunications. <br/><br/>As we know, the party lost the election and its manifesto was condemned as the longest suicide note in history. <br/><br/>This was a unfair epitaph.  <br/><br/>In the subsequent years almost all the major policies in that manifesto came to be enacted, many by Tony Blair, including the introduction of a minimum wage, devolution for Scotland and Wales and, by accident rather than design, the nationalisation of the banks. <br/><br/>It could also be argued Labour was ahead of its time when it came to telecommunications. <br/><br/>The roll-out of cable was left to private firms who, with no public service responsibility, provided the service to wealthy areas without a thought for those places which might actually benefit from having it most. <br/><br/>Giving how inadequate most broadband providers are (you only have to look on Twitter to see a near daily stream of complaints about the shoddy service) Labour’s announcement could prove more popular than the Tories realise.</p>
