      <h1>Bafana Coach: Why We Substituted Lorch…</h1>

      <p>Bafana Bafana suffered a 2-0 defeat to Ghana in their opening Africa Cup Of Nations qualifier, with Molefi Ntseki explaining some of his tactical decisions.</p>
      <p>Ghana took the lead in the 35<sup>th</sup> minute after Ronwen Williams was caught flat-footed in the box.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to ‘overload’ the attacking department and try to pull a goal back, Ntseki replaced Thembinkosi Lorch with Kermit Erasmus and brought on Lebo Mothiba in place of Bradley Grobler. </p>

      </p>
      <p>However, with just 10 minutes remaining of the encounter, the overloading looked to have backfired for Bafana, as Ghana scored their second goal, courtesy of Mohammed Kudos.</p>
      <p>“When you are playing a game like this, everything is moving very fast but you always look for those opportunities where you can hurt your opponent. When we substituted Lorch it was for tactical purposes because we wanted to bring in a striker in Kermit Erasmus and I think when he came in we played him more as a 10 between the lines but Ghana dealt well with the overloading,” Ntseki told the media after the game.</p>
      <p>Bafana will return to Mzansi today, where they will gear up to face Sudan at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday.  </p>
