      <p>NAPLES, Fla. -- Collier County is getting some new generators, that hopefully will help stop a wide range of problems during severe weather.</p>
      <p>FEMA will give the county $3 million to install 53 back-up generators at critical wastewater pump stations.</p>
      <p>It'll help reduce the risk of sewer overflows that can happen during severe weather, the kind of thing that can cause power outages, flooding and storm surge conditions.</p>
