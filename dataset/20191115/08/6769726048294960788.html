      <h1>Shark barrier bring swimmers a sense of security</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:42:53+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Bassett</a></address>
      <p>LONG-DISTANCE swimmers are lapping up a new sense of security from the shark barrier installed off Cottesloe Beach last week.</p>
      <p>Cottesloe Surf Lifesaving Club member Joelle Matier, 21, said installation of the barrier had made her consider doing beach laps herself.</p>
      <p>“I feel more confident, and I’d say I’m doing more laps, and people are swimming out further,” Cottesloe daily lapper Glen Gurney said.</p>
      <p>Cottesloe Council decided in June to spend $835,000 over four years for the installation and maintenance of the 310m-long Eco Shark Barrier from Cottesloe Groyne to the beach near the old pylon.</p>

      <p>The barrier was initially earmarked to be installed in 2015 but negotiations stalled because the Barnett government refused to help fund the project.</p>
      <p>Beachside businesses are reporting increased interest in Cottesloe and that locals are coming back.</p>
      <p>“What we heard from customers were people felt a bit safer about swimming out,” Gelato Bar Cottesloe owner Vickie Hill said.</p>
      <p>Cottesloe General Store owner Lynda Kenny-Cassell said she heard supportive comments from local residents last weekend.</p>
      <p>“Regular customers were saying they were coming back to Cottesloe to take a swim,” Ms Kenny-Cassell said</p>

      <p>Town of Cottesloe mayor Phil Angers said last week he hoped the long-awaited shark barrier would boost business and tourist confidence in the beachside suburb.</p>
      <p>The barrier, which comprises sections of reinforced plastic grids with gaps for fish and other marine life to swim through, attracted a small seal that slipped passed wires attached to the groyne on the first day of operation.</p>
      <p>But the 3m area was filled with another section of barrier on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Eco Shark Barrier inventor Craig Moss said a shark would not attempt the gap washed by waves across submerged rocks.</p>
      <p>Long-time Cottesloe ocean pool proponent Tom Locke said he would now take his ideas to another coastal area saying a pool offered a facility for water sports, the elderly, the disabled and children.</p>
