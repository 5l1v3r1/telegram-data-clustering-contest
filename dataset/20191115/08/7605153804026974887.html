        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 15 – Berlin FC will be out to stamp their authority as North Eastern football kingpins when they take it to the pitch to defend the title as North Eastern Regional finals get the Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom Season 3 underway on the weekend of November 23 at the Garissa University.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last season’s runners-up Al Ansar from Wajir also qualified for the regional finals alongside Admiral from Mandera East and Al Mumtaz from Modogashe.</p>
      <p>Over 40 teams from North Eastern region took part in the grassroots stages of this season’s competition.</p>
      <p>“This year, we will start with Garissa unlike the two previous editions where we started with Narok and Kakamega Counties. This decision was made after we realised the huge impact the tournament has had on the region going by the increase in the number of teams that participated in the grassroots tourneys,” Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom Coordinator, Patrick Korir said.</p>
      <p>Just like the first two seasons of the tournament, the players will take part in life skills and mentorship clinics on Friday, November 22 before competing the following day.</p>
      <p>The winning team will walk away with Sh200,000 and an opportunity to compete at the national finals set for June 2020 while losing finalists will go home with Sh100,000.</p>
      <p>At the end of all the regional finals, an all-Star team comprising of 16 girls and 16 boys will be selected to attend a 10-day training camp in Spain during which they will play friendlies against top Spanish La Liga Football Academies.</p>
      <p>The all-star players will then re-join their teams for preparation for the national finals to be played in Mombasa where the winning teams will be awarded Sh1 million and crowned National Champions.</p>
      <p>After Garissa, the next regional tournament will be held in Mombasa on the weekend of December 7.</p>
      <p>The competition aims at scouting for youth talent, developing grassroots football, and ultimately propel gifted players to the national team.</p>
