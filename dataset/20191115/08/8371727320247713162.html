      <h1>Spotify Is Testing Synced Music Lyrics to Catch up with Apple Music</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:51:45+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:51</time> by <a rel="author">George Kamau</a></address>
      <p>If you are a <a href="https://techweez.com/?s=Spotify">Spotify</a> music binge-listener like me, you are always been bummed out the streaming app doesn’t offer in-app lyrics and have to use a third-party lyrics app like Musixmatch. Well, the streaming giant is now testing real-time lyrics synced to the music playing in the app.</p>
      <p>The app is playing catch-up with Apple Music that introduced timed live lyrics with the launch of <a href="https://techweez.com/?s=ios+13">iOS 13</a>. The tests have gone live for select users.</p>
      <p>The synced lyrics feature will be powered by Musixmatch which is perfect for me who uses both apps. Spotify has previously used Genius to power its Behind the Lyrics feature.</p>
      <p>The lyrics feature will be available beneath the playback controls for selected users such as Canada, Indonesia and Mexico in the same place where Storyline and Behind the Lyrics appear. Spotify users will also view the lyrics in a full-screen experience.</p>

      <p>Apple Music already has live lyrics feature that gives it an edge over other music streaming apps.</p>

      <h3>Confirmation</h3>
      <p>“We can confirm we are testing this feature in a small number of markets. At Spotify, we are always testing new products and experiences but have no further news to share at this time,” A Spotify spokesperson told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/spotify-confirms-its-testing-real-time-lyrics-synced-to-music/">Techcrunch</a>.</p>
