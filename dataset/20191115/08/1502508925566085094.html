      <p>The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the Enforcement Directorate's plea challenging the Delhi High Court order granting bail to Karnataka Congress leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-d-k-shivakumar">D K Shivakumar </a>in a money laundering case.</p>
      <p>A bench comprising Justices R F Nariman and S Ravindra Bhat rejected the request of the Solicitor General, appearing for the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/enforcement-directorate">Enforcement Directorate </a>(ED), to issue a notice to the other side on the appeal.</p>
      <p>The Delhi High Court had on October 23 granted bail to Shivakumar.</p>
      <p>Shivakumar was arrested by the ED on September 3.</p>
      <p>He was in judicial custody as the trial court had denied him bail in the case.</p>
      <p>The high court had granted him bail saying he "cannot tamper with the evidence as the documents are with the investigating agencies".</p>
      <p>The ED had opposed his bail plea saying he was an influential person and he could tamper with evidence and influence witnesses if released.</p>
      <p>Shivakumar, a seven-time MLA in Karnataka, was booked along with Haumanthaiah -- an employee at Karnataka Bhavan in New Delhi -- and others for alleged offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).</p>
      <p>The case was based on a charge sheet filed by the Income Tax Department against them last year before a special court in Bengaluru on charges of alleged tax evasion and 'hawala' transactions worth crores or rupees.</p>
      <p>The I-T department has accused Shivakumar and his alleged associate S K Sharma of indulging in transactions involving huge amounts of unaccounted money on a regular basis through 'hawala' channels with the help of three other accused.</p>
