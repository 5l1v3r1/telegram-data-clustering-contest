        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 15 – Arsenal vice-captain Hector Bellerin is attracting interest from an unnamed club in Italy, according to the player’s agent.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spain international, who has only just returned from a serious knee injury, is looking to get some form under his belt after so much time out on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>There has been reported interest from Serie A giants Juventus and Napoli, who are both thought to be monitoring Bellerin’s situation at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have endured a tough start to the season and already the pressure is mounting on manager Unai Emery to turn things around in north London.</p>
      <p>With the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City dominating, a chance for a Premier League title in the near future looks unlikely for this developing Gunners’ side.</p>
      <p>Arsenal also have a real battle on their hands to get back into the Champions League and the lack of top-tier European football for another campaign could make it tougher for the club to keep hold of its big stars.</p>
      <p>Agent Alberto Botines is adamant that for the moment Bellerin is just focused on his duties at Arsenal but also hinted that the 24-year-old will consider his options in the summer depending on how the season has fared at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>“At the moment, he’s focused on the team’s commitments,” Botines told Sky Sport Italia. “He comes from a bad injury and is returning to his usual level. He likes Italy, there’s already been interest from an Italian club but I can’t reveal it.</p>
      <p>“He has a long contract and it won’t be easy to take him away from Arsenal, he’s their vice-captain. We’ll see how the season goes.”</p>
      <p>Bellerin and company will be looking to ease some of the pressure on Emery when the Gunners host struggling Southampton on November 23.</p>
