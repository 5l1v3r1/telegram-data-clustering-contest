      <h1>FNB Easy Zero account drops the monthly charges, adds a physical card</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:26:23+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:26</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Walker</a></address>
      <p>FNB on Thursday announced a new digital account offering called Easy Zero for those who want “a fully-fledged digital bank account with a card” without monthly fees.</p>
      <p>Eazy Zero offers customers “free card swipes, cost-effective transactional and ATM cash withdrawal fees,” FNB said in a press release.</p>
      <p>Free deposits up to R1500 per month, and free prepaid purchases also feature.</p>
      <p>The digital account is targeted at those who “do not have regular income or have limited banking needs,” said Philani Potwana, FNB Easy CEO.</p>
      <p>“This is partly the reason debit orders are not allowed on the digital account as customers in this segment have limited debit orders.</p>
      <p>“However, for those customers that have a need for debit orders they can still use our competitively priced Easy PAYU and Easy Smart Bundle accounts,” he added.</p>
      <p>The account keeps its mobile money elements though, including the ability to send cash to anyone with an SA phone number.</p>
      <p>Easy Zero customers can also view their account status on their smartphones.</p>
      <p>And sticking to the mobile theme, FNB lets users open an account using a USSD code (*120*227#) without the need for visiting a physical branch.</p>
      <p>In the same announcement, FNB noted its digital account offerings now have “over 140 000 active customers”.</p>
