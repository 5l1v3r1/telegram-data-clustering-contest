      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:30:13+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr showed off his power as he almost knocked out his coach in training.</p>
      <p>The heavyweight world champion is preparing for his rematch with Anthony Joshua as the Brit bids to win back his belts.</p>
      <p>Ruiz shocked the world in June when he dropped Joshua four times before stopping him in the seventh round.</p>
      <p>The rivals will clash in Saudi Arabia on December 7 in one of the most eagerly-awaited fights of the year.</p>
      <p>And the Mexican-American posted a video of himself hitting pads with the caption, "I barely touched him."</p>
      <p>In the footage, Ruiz throws a left hook which catches his trainer and sends him staggering backwards before the coach signals he is OK and is hugged by the champion.</p>

      <p>Ruiz Jr fought Joshua in June at just six weeks' notice and was mocked for being chubby.</p>
      <p>But having shocked the world, he has had three months to prepare for his sequel with Joshua.</p>
      <p>And the champion plans to slim down to make best use of his speed in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>"Right now, I'm only three pounds less than when I fought Anthony Joshua," Ruiz Jr told iFLTV.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people are saying 'he looks too skinny, he won't be strong enough for the fight', but those are people who don't really know about boxing.</p>

      <p>"We've been looking really good inside the ring.</p>
      <p>"I just want to be 6lbs, 8lbs lighter than I was on June 1.</p>
      <p>"That's the goal, to be 8lbs lighter, and that's going to make me feel a lot better.</p>
      <p>"It's going to make me a lot slicker, a lot faster, and that's going to tell on December 7.</p>
      <p>"I weighed in at 268 for the first Anthony Joshua fight, and I'm planning to weigh in at 260 for the next fight.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to lose too much weight because I want to be strong for December 7. We know what we're doing and what we're doing it for."</p>
