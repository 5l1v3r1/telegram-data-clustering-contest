      <p>TSMC has committed to building its most advanced fabs in Taiwan, but that doesn't mean that it will stop expanding production capacity elsewhere, particularly China, which is home to some of its biggest clients. Both TSMC and UMC have plans to increase their <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191115PD200.html">12-inch fab capacity in China</a> to meet growing demand from the country's IC designers. But the US-China trade has indeed been sending more Taiwanese investors returning hom from China. Innolux has already commit over NT$70 billion to building production lines in Taiwan. Fellow panel makers, AUO and CPT, are also <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191115PD204.html">increasing investments in Taiwan</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191115PD200.html">TSMC, UMC plan capacity expansions in China</a>: TSMC and UMC both plan to expand production capacities at their 12-inch wafer fabs in China to satisfy growing demand from local chipmakers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191115PD204.html">Innolux pledges to invest NT$70.1 billion in Taiwan</a>: Panel maker Innolux will invest over NT$70.1 billion (US$2.29 billion) in Taiwan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has announced.
