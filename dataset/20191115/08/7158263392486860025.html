      <ul>
        <li>Camila Cabello got her first tattoo earlier this week.</li>
        <li>The tattoo references a scene from <i>Shakespeare In Love</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>Remember when Kim Kardashian said "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQVk-xCzbAk">Would you ever put a bumper sticker on a Bentley?</a>" to reference her tattoo free status! Of course you do, how could you not? Welp, it looks like Camila Cabello could literally give less of a f*ck about what Kim thinks, because she just got her very first tattoo ever—yay! And if that wasn't already super exciting, <a href="https://www.etonline.com/camila-cabello-and-shawn-mendes-get-tattoos-together-see-the-new-ink-136229">she got the tattoo with her boyfriend, Shawn (Bae) Mendes</a>, by her side. Have you heard of anything more adorable? Nope, I think not.</p>
      <p>Camila and Shawn went to Los Angeles-based tattoo artist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kanenavasard/?utm_source=ig_embed">Kane Navasard</a>, the day after they engaged in that <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29777715/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-body-language-courtside-basketball-pda/">steamy basketball game PDA</a>. So given that info, people thought that Shawn and Camila pulled the trigger and got matching tattoos. Unfortunately, that was not the case! They both got very unique inkings that day—Shawn, the letter "A" behind the back of his ear, and Camila, script lettering of the words "it's a mystery," on the inside of her pinky.</p>

      <p>Now, Camila is giving us the deeper meaning behind the tattoo, and as it turns out, it's a direct quote from the 1998 film, <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>! On Instagram, Camila reposted the original picture Kane posted to his tattoo page and shared with fans how she settled on the design.</p>
      <p>Camila wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>“The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.”<br/>“So what do we do?”<br/>“Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well.” <br/>“How?”<br/>“I don’t know. It’s a mystery.” <br/>From one of my favorite movies of all time, Shakespeare in love 🌹<br/><br/>Never thought I’d get a tattoo before but I asked my mom to write to me a promise she’d want me to make to her that she thought i would need for the rest of my life, long story short, it’s a pinky swear to her to remember, no matter what happens, everything is gonna turn out well. There’s no telling how, but it always does.”</blockquote>
      <p>Need a little more context? Don't worry—I gotchu! Here's the actual scene from the movie that Camila's ink is taken from:</p>

      <p>Soooo, does this have anything at all to do with Shawn? Mmm, it's a possibility, but in addition to the tattoo being about her mother, it likely has its roots in her upcoming album,<i> Romance</i>. Shakespeare is the father of romantic poetry, after all!</p>
