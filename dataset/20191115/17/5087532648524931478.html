      <h1>Apple News+ is Apparently Struggling for Subscribers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:23:34+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/charlotte-henry/" target="_blank">Charlotte Henry</a></address>
      <p>Apple News+ signed up 200,000 people in the first 48 hours of going live, back in March. However, that number has reportedly not risen in any meaningful way after that.</p>

      <h3>Apple News+ Numbers Stuck</h3>
      <p>Sources told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/apple-news-has-struggled-to-add-subscribers-since-march-launch.html"><i>CNBC</i></a> that while the official numbers are not made available to publishers they had not increased materially since March. Unsurprisingly, the company made no comment on the story.</p>
      <p>Apple News+ recently <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/columns-opinions/editorial/apple-news-first-impressions-of-the-uk-offer/">rolled out in the UK and Australia</a>. It costs $9.99 a month and It provides users with access to 300 top-end publics. Apple shares 50 percent revenue with publishers. </p>
