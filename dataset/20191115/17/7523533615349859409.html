      <p>Camille Walala’s works might be instantly recognizable, but the London-based designer still creates them in unexpected places – as with this gas station in <a href="https://thespaces.com/tag/arkansas">Arkansas’</a> Fort Smith.</p>
      <p>The French designer has transformed a disused vintage petrol station into a public piece of art, created with the help of local volunteers who spent several days painting the structure with Walala’s dizzyingly colourful design.</p>

      <p><a href="https://thespaces.com/tag/camille-walala">Walala</a> wrapped the 1950 structure in her signature black-and-white stripes and pastel shades, influenced by her love of the Memphis movement, ‘dazzle’ painting techniques and textiles by women of the Southern Ndebele tribe.</p>
      <p>The Walala Pump &amp; Go is commissioned by the <a href="https://www.justkidsofficial.com/artist-list">creative studio JustKids</a> and will remain in-situ for the foreseeable future.</p>
