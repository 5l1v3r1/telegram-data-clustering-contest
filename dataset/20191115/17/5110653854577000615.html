      <h1>Myles Garrett suspended indefinitely for helmet swing; Browns, Steelers each fined $250K</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:23:49+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>About 12 hours after a benches-clearing brawl sparked by Myles Garrett tearing Mason Rudolph's helmet off and hitting him in the head with it, the NFL <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLfootballinfo/status/1195383502113509378">handed down</a>punishments to Browns and Steelers players, including an indefinite suspension for Garrett and a $250,000 fine for both Cleveland and Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>Garrett's suspensionwill last at least through the rest of the 2019 regular season and playoffs. Hemust "meet with the commissioner's office prior to a decision on his reinstatement," the NFL's statement read.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Steelers offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey, who retaliated against Garrett with punches and a kick to the helmet, was suspended for three games.</p>
      <p>Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi, who shoved Rudolph to the ground following Garrett's helmet swing, received a one-game suspension.</p>
      <p>All three players have been suspended without pay and fined an undisclosed amount of money for their actions during Thursday night's game. The NFL's statement also said that "additional discipline for other players will be forthcoming."</p>
      <p>Absent from the list of suspended players is <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/mason-rudolph-suspension-myles-garrett/1e9p6e3p28vd31bqe2bgpmst3y">Rudolph</a>, who played a role in escalating the fight. The second-year QB appeared to take offense to the being hit by Garrett after letting go of a pass, and while on the ground, Rudolph attempted to take Garrett's helmet off. He failed, but Garrett was successful in returning the favor, leading to the infamous helmet swing.</p>
      <p>While Rudolph will apparently avoid suspension, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero <a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1195409049233158144">reported</a> "the NFL will fine" Rudolph.</p>
