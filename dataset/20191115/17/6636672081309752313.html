        <b>This one looks impressive – the Kitronik ARCADE, encouraging kids to code their own game that they can play on the handheld console. Think of it as Nintendo Switch meets Scratch….</b>

      <p>For the programming it uses Microsoft’s MakeCode, which is a kid-friendly, colour-themed graphical block-structured approach to coding blocks. You could think of it as Redmond’s answer to MIT’s Scratch.</p>

      <p>It is what is used on the BBC Micro:bit devices, and Kitronik has lots of experience around the Micro:bit (see here and here, for example).</p>
      <p>Specifically, it uses the MakeCode Arcade Block Editor to host and edit the code, which is downloaded to the device. Although you can also use Javascript and a Python editor is promised soon.</p>
      <p>Give it a go, to see how easy arm intuitive it is: <a href="https://arcade.makecode.com/">arcade.makecode.com</a></p>

      <p>The device features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A full colour LCD wide viewing angle screen</li>
        <li>A clear case – all electronics are on show but protected from everyday knocks</li>
        <li>A piezo sounder for audio feedback</li>
        <li>6 gamer input buttons</li>
        <li>A menu button</li>
        <li>A reset button and an on/off switch</li>
        <li>Vibration motor for Haptic feedback</li>
        <li>Software volume control</li>
        <li>A USB programming port and two expansion ports for expert level users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s powered by either 3xAA batteries or via the micro USB connector</p>
      <p>You can find details of the device on the Kitronik <a href="https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5311-arcade-for-makecode-arcade.html">website</a>, with the full data sheet <a href="https://www.kitronik.co.uk/pdf/5311-kitronik-Arcade-gamepad-makecode-datasheet.pdf">here</a> (it runs on an Atmel Atmel SAMD51J19A, the LED screen is 160 x 128 and there are two expansion ports, for example).</p>
      <p>Pricing starts from £29.95 (£35.94 including VAT).</p>

      <h3>Kitronik ARCADE fun</h3>

      <p>It’s a great idea, as kids seem to hooked on gaming devices and this promises a way of bringing an incentive to start coding. Kitronik takes up this theme:</p>
      <blockquote>“The MakerCode Arcade allows the teaching of computational thinking via the medium of games and this engages learners by providing a rewarding goal, the chance to play the game they have designed!” Said Kitronik director Dave Sanderson.<br/><br/>“This is a very engaging way of introducing young people to coding and we have therefore created a device that would facilitate this and be accessible for a range of users. It features the same editor as the successful BBC micro:bit and there is already a wealth of games and tutorials for education providers and home users to get involved with and have fun with their own retro games.”</blockquote>
      <p>What a great idea!</p>
