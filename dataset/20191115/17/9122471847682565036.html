      <h1>Clemson vs. Wake Forest: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:33:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Clemson Tigers look to extend their winning streak to 26 games as they take on the Wake Forest Demon Deacons in their final in-conference game of the year.</p>
      <p>Clemson clinched a spot in the ACC Championship Game last week after beating NC State and watching Wake Forest lose to Virginia Tech. The Tigers seemed on the verge of losing after a rough September. But since then they’ve reeled off five wins where they’ve scored at least 45 points while allowing 14 or less.</p>
      <p>If not for Wake Forest’s loss to Virginia Tech last week, this game would have had far greater implications. The Demon Deacons would have been in a position to steal a spot in the ACC Championship Game out from under Clemson if they had won out. But now, even if Wake Forest upsets the heavily-favored Tigers, they’ll have to settle for second place in the division.</p>
      <p>Given that Clemson has outscored their last five foes by 31 to 52 points, it’s no shock that the Tigers are favored by five touchdowns at home.</p>

      <p>With so many strong one-loss teams out there Clemson has <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/clemson-tigers/clemson-football-undefeated-miss-college-football-playoff-heather-dinich">no room for error</a> if they want to make the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>They’ll have a bye next week before their season finale against South Carolina.</p>
