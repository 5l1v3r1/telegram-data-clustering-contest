      <h3>October 2019 brought some relief to Indian carmakers after months of sales slowdown and here are the top 25 best-selling cars</h3>
      <p>Thanks to a higher demand during the Diwali season, most Indian carmakers saw an improvement in their sales figure in October 2019. And to give you, our dear readers, an idea about the sales performance of some of the popular car models, we have compiled a list of top 25 selling cars of October 2019, which comprises everything from the highly popular Maruti Dzire to the dated but highly capable Ford EcoSport</p>
      <p>Pretty unsurprisingly, the first model in the list of 25 best-selling cars in India was the Maruti Dzire, which sold 19,569 units in October 2019. This even marked an YoY improvement of 12 per cent over 17,404 units sold In October 2018. Even the second-best-selling car in October 2019 comes from Maruti’s stables.</p>
      <p>The Swift, with a monthly sale of 19,401 units, took a close second place. It even marked an YoY growth of 13 per cent from sales of 17,215 units in October last year.</p>

      <p>The third sport also goes to a Maruti model as the Alto twins have clocked a sales volume of 17,903 units last month. This is a 19 per cent drop from 22,180 units sold in October 2018. Even the fourth place has been secured by a Maruti model as the Baleno has registered a monthly sale of 16.237 units last month. This is a 13 per cent drop from 18,657 units sold in the same month last year.</p>
