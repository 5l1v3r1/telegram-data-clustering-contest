        <b>Former Lions captain Sam Warburton has joined Wales' new-look coaching team under new boss Wayne Pivac. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Welsh international flanker was forced to retire at the age of 29 last season after failing to recover from knee and neck injuries and his new role will be his experience of coaching.</p>
      <p>Warburton will work alongside Byron Hayward on defence in the new setup and says it's a huge honour to land the role:</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted to be part of the senior national coaching team."</p>
      <p>“It is a genuine privilege to be considered for such a role and I can’t wait to do my upmost to contribute to help improve the team and players.  With such a great group of players and management it is an amazing opportunity which I am very proud to be given”</p>
      <p>“Sam is one of the most experienced leaders in rugby with excellent knowledge and communication skills and having only recently retired he has a full grasp on the international game,” former Scarlets boss Pivac said of the appointment.</p>
      <p>“We looked at the coaching structure and the roles of each coach and believed by adding a second defensive role into the team adds value, adds a point of difference and allows a specialist to work in the contact area and I believe Byron and Sam will compliment each other in the roles.”</p>
