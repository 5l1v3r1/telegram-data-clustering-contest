      <p>Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Paryaya Palimar Mutt said on Friday that the teachings and compositions of the saint-composer Kanakadasa were relevant for all time.</p>
      <p>He was speaking at the culmination of the Sri Kanaka Sadbhavana Jyoti Ratha Yatre on the occasion of the Kanakadasa Jayanti here.</p>
      <p>The seer said that Kanakadasa had offered ‘roti’ and ‘ganji’ as ‘naivedya’ during his stay here. This tradition continued to this day. This showed the kind of influence Kanakadasa had in Udupi, he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier the yatre, which began from Bengaluru and reached Jodu Katte here on Friday, was given a grand welcome. The yatre along with a procession went through the main streets and finally culminated in front of the Sri Kanakadasa Mandira here. Vidyadheesha Tirtha offered special prayers to the idol of Sri Kanakadasa at the Mandira.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, G. Jagadeesha, Deputy Commissioner, said that the teachings and ‘kirtanas’ of the saint-composer, which emphasised on peace and harmony in the society, were eternal.</p>
      <p>He was speaking after inaugurating the Sri Kanakadasa Jayanti organised by the district administration and other organisations, here.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jagadeesha said that his kirtanas written in a simple language had deep philosophical insights and they were also aimed at reforming the society. “People should follow the teachings of Sri Kanakadasa,” he said.</p>
      <p>Delivering a special lecture on the occasion, Meti Mudiyappa, retired professor, said that Sri Kanakadasa was a national saint.</p>
