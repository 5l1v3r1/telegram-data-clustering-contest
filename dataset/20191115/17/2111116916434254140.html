      <p>If you're looking for a cheap <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-top-5-chromebooks-in-the-us-1233696">Chromebook</a> and fast, then Lenovo and Walmart have concocted a sweet deal just for you as part of the early <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/walmart-black-friday-cyber-monday-2019">Walmart Black Friday</a> sale.</p>
      <p>The duo are selling this Chromebook for more than $200 off of Lenovo's list price, making it one of the cheapest Chromebooks we've seen this year ahead of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday 2019</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cyber-monday/cyber-monday-2019">Cyber Monday 2019</a>.</p>

      <p>Short of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/need-a-cheap-laptop-fast-this-one-is-just-dollar99-ahead-of-black-friday">that $99 Windows laptop</a> we found a while back, we haven't seen that many nearly double-digit priced laptops since.</p>
      <p>If all you or a loved one needs is to browse Facebook, access social media and watch videos, then this should be an ideal laptop for them. Â Of course, it hugely helps that it's as cheap as it is, but remember not to expect a powerhouse out of the box.</p>
