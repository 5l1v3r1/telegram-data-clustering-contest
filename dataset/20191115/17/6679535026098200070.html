      <p>The surge in fantasy sports users could be attributed to the rise of league-based sports and the growth of online viewership combined with increased smartphone penetration.</p>
      <p>This was documented in a study titled ‘Fantasy Sports: A Game of Skill or Chance’ by the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore faculty member U. Dinesh Kumar. The study was co-authored by Shailaja Grover and Sharada Sringeswara.</p>
      <p>U. Dinesh Kumar, Chair, Data Centre and Analytics Lab, and Faculty from the Decision Sciences area, said that fantasy sports increase the engagement of fans with the sports. Participants select imaginary teams of real players. “The teams compete based on the statistical performance of selected players in the actual games and statistical performance (such as runs scored, wickets taken) is converted into points,” said Prof. Kumar.</p>
      <p>The study employs statistical hypotheses techniques used on actual, anonymised fantasy sports data to test the above skill dominance tests. They used anonymised data that was given by Dream11 — one of the biggest fantasy sports company in India — for the purpose of this study.</p>
      <p>The study revealed that skilled participants select players based on playing conditions, player’s strength, past performance against a specific opponent, injury information and so on. Another finding was that the learning effect states that playing more regularly or practising improves the chances of winning in a skill dominant game but has no effect in games dominant by chance.</p>
      <p>It also stated that scores or payoffs of users in a skill dominant game will be consistent and not random. While skill based games necessitate the use of strategies or a series of decisions that lead to greater payoffs, in a chance dominant game, payoffs are independent of the strategies employed by the players. The study, however, stated that chance based games (like Bingo) depend on pure luck, and no amount of practise will help.</p>
