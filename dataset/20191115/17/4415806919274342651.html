      <p>Taylor Swift’s former record label has denied it is blocking the singer from performing her own hits at the upcoming American Music Awards (AMAs).</p>
      <p>Big Machine Label Group (BMLG), which owns the rights to much of Swift’s back catalogue, also denied her claims that it had moved to stop the release of a Netflix documentary about her life.</p>
      <p>On Thursday the Lover chart-topper, 29, accused BMLG head and prominent music industry figure Scooter Braun, 38, of “exercising tyrannical control” over her career.</p>

      <p>She alleged he and Scott Borchetta were blocking her from performing a medley of her songs at the AMAs, where she will be named artist of the decade later this month.</p>
      <p>Borchetta founded BMLG, which signed Swift as a teenager and for which she recorded many of her hits.</p>
      <p>However, earlier this year Braun, who manages high-profile pop stars including Justin Bieber, acquired Swift’s back catalogue, with Swift saying she was “sad” and “grossed out” at the move.</p>
      <p>In a statement released on Friday via its website, representatives of BMLG described Swift’s allegations as “false information”.</p>
      <p>They claimed that Swift “has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company”.</p>

      <p>In her post on Thursday, Swift encouraged her fans to make their feelings known to executives Braun and Borchetta.</p>
      <p>Addressing these comments, the statement said: “However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families.”</p>
      <p>It continued: “Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist.”</p>
      <p>BMLG also said they were “shocked” by Swift’s comments and that “to date, not one of the invitations to speak with us and work through this has been accepted”.</p>

      <p>They urged her to meet with them and settle the dispute.</p>
      <p>Stars including Halsey and Gigi Hadid rushed to support Swift after she shared the statement on her social media accounts on Thursday.</p>
      <p>In the lengthy message she claimed the two men are preventing her from performing her old songs at the AMAs as it would constitute “re-recording them before I’m allowed to next year”.</p>
      <p>She also announced Netflix has created a documentary about “my life for the past few years”.</p>
      <p>Borchetta and Scooter have declined the use of her older music or performance footage for the project, she alleged.</p>
