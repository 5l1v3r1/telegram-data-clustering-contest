      <p>If ever a band should be decancelled it’s Pinegrove. I’d even argue that dude’s a better person than most because he felt bad about being a jerkin a relationship. He did everything right, and based on Jenn Pelly’s excellent article on Pitchfork, and not sure he’s guilty of anything beyond getting himself over his head in a young relationship.</p>
      <p>Enough with the first thing anyone brings up about Pinegrove is this nonsense. They’re an exciting young band and they’re just getting started. If I were their management I’d try to get them on your with Wilco. Not necessarily because they sound the same, but more so because that audience would really connect with them.</p>

      <p>I wrote down all my comments last night well in advance of this one.</p>
      <p>My father passed away 20 minutes ago. There is a lot of waiting going on around here, so I have time to post something.</p>
      <p>A great big thank-you to my friends on here, well-wishers, acquaintances, passers-by and everyone in between, who would give kindness across the Internet into a Stereogum comment box. It doesn’t seem like much, it’s the Internet and it’s very easy to be anything on here, good or bad. But good words are what we do on this part of the website, and they count so much in days of anger. It made—makes—a difference.</p>
      <p>I’ll be around, of course. I have a Debby Boone defense to post, and I’m going to need many distractions in the short term. It will seem awkward, but music tends to be a lifeline, and a way of protecting sanity right now.</p>
      <p>My father wasn’t a large music fan, but he encouraged an appreciation of the arts growing up, getting us tickets to Broadway shows, taking us kids to museums and so on. And he would try and get me a Billboard from the city when he could. So I think he understood and appreciated curiosity.</p>
      <p>And that’s why I’m here: curiosity. That’s his gift, and I wouldn’t trade it.</p>
      <p>Thank you again, friends.</p>
