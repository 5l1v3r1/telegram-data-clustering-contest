      <h2>Ajay Kumar has failed to prevent the suicide of employees, says Ramchander Rao</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:35:49+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Telangana unit has demanded the resignation of Transport Minister P. Ajay Kumar taking ‘moral responsibility’ for the recent deaths of striking TSRTC employees on Friday.</p>
      <p>“What is the point of being a Minister if he cannot prevent suicides due to the RTC impasse? The stir has reached 42 days and the government’s adamant attitude is making the staff desperate. What does it plan to do with the employees?” asked MLC and senior leader N. Ramchander Rao.</p>
      <p>At a press conference held at the State office, Mr. Rao said instead of criticising the opposition parties, the TRS leaders should introspect on their role in addressing the RTC issue as general public were facing the brunt owing to the total collapse of public transport for more than a month, even as the families of the striking employees have been left to fend for themselves without salary.</p>
      <p>“I appeal to the TSRTC employees not to resort to extreme steps as people are with them and our party too has extended its wholehearted support. We should fight and live to see the day when the TRS will collapse on its own and it is not far off,” he claimed.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rao criticised the government for not heeding to even the High Court when it advised holding talks and also offered to form a committee of eminent jurists to look into the demands of the workers. “The Chief Minister has been holding marathon meetings with officials on privatisation, then why cannot he hold the same discussions with the employees?” he asked.</p>
      <p>The BJP as a political party has a responsibility to highlight the issues plaguing the people in general and has every right to take up the cause of the TSRTC employees. “There is nothing unethical about it. In any case, we need not learn political ethics from a party that has been resorting to defections,” he maintained.</p>
