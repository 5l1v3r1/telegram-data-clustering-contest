      <h1>Robert Downey Jr. Will Reprise His Iron Man Role in an Episode of Marvel's WHAT IF...? Animated Series</h1>

      <p>It looks like <b>Robert Downey Jr.</b> will play Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, one more time… in animated form. According to <b>Jeff Goldblum</b>, Downey Jr. will provide the voice of Iron Man in an episode of <b><i>Marvel’s</i></b><b><i>What If…?</i></b> animated series that will also include his Grandmaster character.</p>
      <p>While talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve0A_dZMh74&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=675">BuzzFeed</a>, Goldblum offered the following details and the reveal of Downey’s Jr.’s involvement is a pretty cool surprise:</p>
      <blockquote>"I played the part again a couple of days ago. I went to the Disney studios and I recorded the Grandmaster's voice for an episode of a show that's gonna be on Disney+ that's called <i>What If...?. </i>It's an animated version of all the characters we know and love from Marveland this episode included the Grandmaster and Iron Man, so Robert Downey will do a voice for that, and Korg. <b>Taika Waititi</b> had already recorded his voice for that, so yeah, for a couple hours I enjoyed doing that.”</blockquote>
      <p>We already knew that Goldblum and Waititi would be reprising their Marvel roles for the <i>What If...?</i> series, but this is the first time it’s ever been mentioned that Downey Jr. is coming back. I imagine that Goldblum wasn’t supposed to say anything about this, but it’s out there now and he can’t take it back.</p>
      <p><b><i>Marvel’s What If…?</i></b> will be a 23-episode anthology series where The Watcher (<b>Jeffrey Wright</b>) looks at instances of where the MCU could have gone in a completely different direction. You can see some cool footage from the series<a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/first-awesome-footage-shared-for-marvels-what-if-animated-series"> here</a>. I’m curious to know what a story involving Iron Man, Grandmaster, and Korg will be.</p>
      <p>As for if Goldblum will reprise his role as Grandmaster in <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>, the actor says, "We're talking about it, in fact, I hope so. I love Taika Waititi, he's a great director and a friend of mine."</p>
      <p>It’d be a shame if we didn’t see Grandmaster up on the big screen again!</p>
