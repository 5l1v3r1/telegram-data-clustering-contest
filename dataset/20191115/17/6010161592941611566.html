      <p><b>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</b> is tough. The game takes heavy inspiration from brutal melee action games like Dark Souls and Sekiro, so you’ll need strong reflexes, determination, and a patient head to prevail.</p>
      <p>Just like the Estus Flask in FromSoftware games, <b>BD-1’s Stim Canisters</b> are your lifeline against the forces of evil, bringing you back from the brink when you need it most.</p>
      <p>It’s in your best interest then to collect as many Stim Canister upgrades as you can, so you can heal yourself without having to respawn enemies by meditating.</p>
      <p>Here are all of the Stim Canister upgrades we’ve found for BD-1 so far, across Bogano, Zeffo, and Kashyyyk.</p>
      <h3>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Stim Canister Upgrades</h3>
      <h4>Bogano Stim Canister Upgrades</h4>
      <p><b>Binog Mesa</b> – Return to the Binog Mesa after you’ve gotten the Wall Run on Bogano. Where you would have had to drop down before, you can run across the wall and get to a new area.</p>
      <p>Then go down the hole on the other side into the Subterranean Refuge. This secret room houses a Stim Canister upgrade.</p>

      <p><b>Landing Pad</b> – Next once you’ve gotten the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-tomb-eilram-walkthrough-ball-puzzle-solutions/">Force Push ability from the Tomb of Eilram on Zeffo</a>, go back to Bogano and solve the ball puzzle underneath the ship.</p>
      <p>To complete the puzzle you need to push the ball along the raised runway into the slot.</p>

      <p>It can be tricky to line up, but try Force pushing it at an angle as the ball rolls back down the slope.</p>

      <h4>Zeffo Stim Canister Upgrades</h4>
      <p><b>Derelict Hangar</b> – After you land on Zeffo, go down the path on to the right of the Mantis.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Jump up and you’ll see to enemies chewing on a Stormtrooper.</p>
      <p>Follow this path all the way around to the left and you’ll see a side-path that you can jump to on your right.</p>

      <p>It’s dark inside, but keep following the path all the way around to the left, then to the right, then jump onto the top of the platform with the crate. This is where you’ll find the Stim Canister upgrade.</p>

      <h4>Kashyyyk Stim Canister Upgrades</h4>
      <p><b>Between Origin Lake and Shadowlands</b> – On your second visit to Kashyyk, look behind you as you enter the Shadowlands area from Origin Lake.</p>

      <p>Turn around and you should see a Stim Canister crate in the distance. Jump across the Lung Plants to get up to the Stim Canister upgrade.</p>
