      <p>A teenage violin prodigy who died at family's Kensington home had been self harming but did not mean to kill herself, and inquest has ruled.</p>
      <p>Ekaterina Tsukanova, the daughter of Russian banker Igor Tsukanov, was found dead at the £9.5 million property in June, just eight days after she performed at the Royal Opera House.</p>
      <p>She returned home at 3:30am after a night out with friends and was let in by her father.</p>
      <p>But hours later paramedics rushed to the mansion in Kensington, west London after her body was discovered in the bathroom.</p>
      <p>Police discovered compression marks around her neck and a post mortem examination found they matched a ligature found by her body - concluding she had died from "fatal compression to the neck."</p>

      <p>Officers also found a knife in the room and cuts to her forearms.</p>
      <p>Westminster Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliff ruled that she had died by "misadventure" - and that she had not intended to kill herself.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/11/violin-prodigy-17-found-dead-kensington-mansion-amid-warning/">her father reported that she had died of a drugs overdose</a> from a cocktail of cocaine and ketamine known as a 'Calvin Klein,' but a toxicology report showed that there were no drugs present in her system.</p>
      <p>The inquest was told that on June 5, 2018, just over a year before her death, she met with a psychologist and confessed she had been self harming and drinking to cope with GCSE exam stress.</p>
      <p>Her therapist, Tanya Lecchi, told the inquest that Ekaterina, a student at £12,600 per team Wycombe Abbey independent girls' boarding school in Buckinghamshire, went through "dark periods."</p>
      <p>Concluding thehearing, Dr Radcliff said: "There was no suicide note, there had been no previous attempt, there was no significant history of psychological significance.</p>
      <p>"At the time she was intoxicated and, in a young girl, that has led me to consider if she had a clear thought to harm herself or if this was an impulsive act.</p>
      <p>"I conclude that this was a case of misadventure - she deliberately undertook an act that had unexpected consequences."</p>
