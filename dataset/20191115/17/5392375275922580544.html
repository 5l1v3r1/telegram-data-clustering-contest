      <p><a href="https://xidustore.com/products/xidu-philbook-max-touchscreen-laptop"><b><u><b>The XIDU PhilBook Max</b></u></b></a> has been the protagonist of important improvements within its system. As in its large section of features, the <b><b>XIDU PhilBook Max</b></b> has a 1920×1080 Full HD NanoEdge screen, which has a durable 360-degree hinge that can be used to flip the 14.1-inch touch screen to store mode, support mode and tablet mode. Its model and design adheres to the style of space metal gray with a shiny silver frame.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2JB20MQ"><b><u><b>The XIDU PhilBook Max</b></u></b></a> features a lightweight metal body of 1.39 kg in weight and 16.4 mm thick, which makes the laptop durable and beautiful to provide a timeless appearance and meet the demands of easy transportation.

      <p>But it is in its performance, where the <b><b>XIDU PhilBook Max</b></b> manifested a rather crucial change for its technical characteristics. Where it previously had 6GB LPDDR3, 128GB SSD storage, with Intel Apollo Lake J3355 Dual – Core, 2.0 GHz – 2.5 GHz, and low-frequency energy savings, which means it can do more with much faster speeds.</p>
      <p>But thanks to the magnificent vision of XIDU that seeks to provide much more affordable and innovative computer products for its customers, the <b><b>XIDU PhilBook Max</b></b> now stars an important innovation in its system while the cost of its new technical profile does not vary at all with its predecessor. Now the <b><b>PhilBook Max</b></b> has much faster performance developed by the Intel E3950 quad-core processor with 128 GB of SSD storage and 8 GB of RAM, for efficient performance with a bright backlit keyboard.</p>
