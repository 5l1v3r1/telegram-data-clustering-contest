      <h3>Best Buy’s Start Your List sale</h3>
      <p>Best Buy is ending the week by <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/15/best-buy-start-your-list-ipad-pro-deals/">kicking off its Start Your List sale</a>, offering a variety of discounts on iPads, Nest bundles, TVs, smart home gear, drones, and more. Most notably, <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/15/best-buy-start-your-list-ipad-pro-deals/">there are deals on Nest Mini bundles</a> and you’ll be able to take <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/15/best-buy-start-your-list-ipad-pro-deals/">up to <b>$199 off</b> a selection of Apple’s latest 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models</a>. These price cuts match our previous mentions and are right around the all-time lows for the most part, though we have seen some of the higher-end iPad Pro deals land at up to $249 off before.</p>
      <h3>Acer’s premium 15-inch Chromebook is $299</h3>
      <p>Walmart is offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/14/aluminum-chromebook-acer/">Acer Chromebook 715 15.6-inch Touchscreen 2.2GHz/4GB/128GB for <b>$299</b></a>. That’s $80 off the typical rate there and is the lowest we’ve seen it go. With many Chromebooks sporting a cheap chassis, Acer’s 715 ratchets things up with an all-aluminum exterior. This delivers a MacBook-esque look and feel while clocking in at a fraction of the cost. Another notable feature includes 128GB of storage, which is significantly more than the 32GB or 64GB sizes that we often see. Up to 12-hour battery life can be achieved on a single charge, leaving you with all-day performance. Inputs include 2x USB-C, 3.5mm, microSD, and USB-A.</p>
      <h3>Ring Video Doorbell Pro deters porch pirates at $129</h3>
      <p>Amazon is currently offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/14/ring-video-doorbell-pro-refurbished/">Ring Video Doorbell Pro in certified refurbished condition for <b>$129</b></a>. Typically selling for <a href="https://amzn.to/2KbdDuA">$249</a> in new condition, you’ll find today’s offer down from the usual $179 refurbished listings. That’s good for an up to 49% discount and is the lowest we’ve seen, new or otherwise.</p>
      <p>Ring Doorbell Pro features 1080p video recording alongside 30 days of free cloud storage. Unique to this model is dual-band Wi-Fi support, which you won’t find on the lower-end Ring offerings. There’s also enhanced motion detection, so you’ll always be notified when there’s activity outside. Includes a one-year warranty direct from Amazon.</p>
      <h3>Save $80 on Sony’s Xperia 10 Plus Smartphone</h3>
      <p>Amazon currently offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/15/sony-xperia-10-plus/">Sony Xperia 10 Plus 64GB GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone for <b>$350</b></a>. Usually selling for $430, today’s offer saves you nearly 20%, is $30 below Best Buy’s current sale price, and marks a new Amazon all-time low. Centered around a 6.5-inch HD display, Sony features a dual rear camera array comprised of 8 and 12MP sensors. Everything comes powered by a Snapdragon 1.8GHz octa-core processor and includes 64GB of onboard storage. If that’s not enough, a microSD card slot allows for easy expansion.
