      <p>From <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/11/15/trump-advisor-roger-stone-conv.html">Mark Frauenfelder's post</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Roger Stone was found guilty of lying to a Congressional House committee about his involvement with Wikileaks and for witness tampering. The jury deliberated for eight hours before convicting him of all seven counts. The 67-year-old felon could serve up to 50 years in prison.</blockquote>
      <p>Presidential Pardon?</p>
      <p>Or will he turn on Trump?</p>

      <p>And from <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/11/15/breaking-roger-stone-guilty-o.html">Rob Beschizza's post today</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The big picture: Prosecutors alleged in closing arguments that Stone lied to congressional investigators because he "knew that if this information came out it would look really bad for his longtime associate Donald Trump," the New York Times reports.<br/><br/>CNN notes that the most significant revelation from Stone's trial was "the extent to which Stone was in touch with Trump directly and other campaign officials, and how they eagerly anticipated WikiLeaks' releases of hacked Democratic emails in 2016."</blockquote>
      <p>And you know nobody is enjoying this day like John Podesta.</p>

      <p>In August, 2016, Roger Stone famously tweeted, "it will soon be Podesta’s time in the barrel.”</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, WikiLeaks began publishing John Podesta's stolen emails.</p>
