      <p>Newly inducted Ministers in the Manohar Lal Khattar Cabinet assumed charge here on Friday, with senior Minister Anil Vij warning government officials to perform or be prepared to take voluntary retirement from service.</p>

      <p>“I will not tolerate laxity on anyone’s part,” Mr. Vij said. “My message to them (government officials) is to perform and if any official feels he cannot do so, then he/she can take voluntary retirement,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Vij, who has been entrusted with the key portfolio of the Home Department during his second consecutive term as a Minister, said he will work to improve the image of the police so that its acceptability among the public increases.</p>
      <p>Kanwar Pal, who began his new stint as the State’s Education Minister, said he would focus on providing qualitative education and improving the performance of government schools students.</p>
      <p>Kamlesh Dhanda, the lone woman Minister in the Cabinet said that coming from the rural hinterland, she will work to improve the lives of women, especially those living in the State’s rural areas.</p>
      <p>Ranjit Chautala, son of former Deputy Prime Minister late Devi Lal, gave the assurance that there will be no shortage of electricity during his tenure as Power Minister.</p>
