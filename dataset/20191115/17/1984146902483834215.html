      <h2>Yaseen Ashraf, of West Denton, admitted offences including storing explosives without a licence</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:59:32+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>Lives were put at risk when a large amount of fireworks were illegally stored in what could have left people dead or maimed in a "potential disaster", a court heard.</p>
      <p>More than 300 kilos of the explosive-laden goods were stored in an area between a family home and their business in West Denton, Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Newcastle Crown Court heard the fireworks were stored next to flammable material liquid petroleum gas cylinders, which were empty but the vapour from which made the situation even more dangerous.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said it was a "flagrant breach of the law" and there was a "foreseeable risk" of serious injury or death to people living upstairs or even walking past.</p>
      <p>Now Yaseen Ashraf, of The Burnside, West Denton, has been given a suspended prison sentence after admitted offences including storing explosives without a licence.</p>
      <p>Recorder David Gordon told him: "It became clear you were storing a significant amount of fireworks in an area behind some roller shutters and these were of an extremely dangerous nature and in a very large quantity.</p>
      <p>"The situation is you had no licence to store fireworks in those premises.</p>
      <p>"Even more concerning, the fireworks were being stored in close proximity to flammable material and gas cylinders. Even though they were empty there was still a serious hazard caused because of the vapour that would have remained in them.</p>
      <p>"This was a concerning situation indeed. One really worries about what would have happened had they ignited. This was a residential area with a number of dwelling houses in close proximity and they were being stored close to the highway.</p>
      <p>"It was perhaps by good luck rather than management that a potential disaster was averted.</p>
      <p>"Although, thankfully, no harm was in fact caused, there was very obviously a high risk of death or at least physical harm to those in the vicinity.</p>
      <p>"What you did was extremely dangerous, I'm sure you understand that now."</p>
      <p>The court heard the case related to two retail and one residential property on The Burnside.</p>
      <p>The business at number 18 did previously have a licence to store explosives but that expired in 2016 and was not renewed, while the business at number 30 did have such a licence but only to store 75 kilos of fireworks.</p>
      <p>The offences came to light after Ashraf contacted contacted West Denton community fire station about concerns about firework in the area.</p>
      <p>During a visit to the shop at number 30 later that date, it wad discovered that there were actually 93 kilos, in breach of the limit.</p>
      <p>More seriously, in an area between the other shop and the home, there was a large number of fireworks.</p>
      <p>Paul Cross, prosecuting, said: "In the property there were LPG cylinders - they were not full of LPG but would still retain some of the vapour when empty.</p>
      <p>"There was a large amount of building waste which was combustible."</p>
      <p>Ashraf said there was £15,000 of fireworks there, although invoices suggested they had cost £5,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Cross told the court: "There was no licence for these fireworks and there was also a failure to comply with regulations for storing them away from flammable material and also a breach of the separation distance required for the storing of those sort of quantities of fireworks."</p>
      <p>In total there were more than 350 kilos of what was described as "explosive mass".</p>
      <p>The prosecutor added: "That would require a separate storage building located away from other goods and buildings and public highways.</p>
      <p>"When they were moved they weren't put in the same shop for that reason. It's not safe to keep that type of quantity all together.</p>
      <p>"If there was a fire, this stuff would make the fire burn extremely aggressively and there would be a risk of some of the fireworks exploding at the same time and the fire would get out of control rather quickly.</p>
      <p>"It was a flagrant breach of the law and there was a foreseeable risk. Anyone in the upstairs flat or potentially someone walking past could suffer serious injury or even possibly death."</p>
      <p>Ashraf, 32, pleaded guilty to four health and safety breaches - two offences of storing explosives without a licence, failing to maintain the required separation distance between the store and other buildings and failing to take appropriate measures to limit the extent of fire or explosion or its spread.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to eight month imprisonment suspended for 18 months with 150 hours unpaid work an £850 costs. An order was made for the fireworks to be destroyed.</p>
      <p>Rachel Hedworth, defending, conceded: "The reality is had there been an explosion and if someone had been there, they would have died, that's the stark reality."</p>
      <p>However she pointed out it was Ashraf who had contacted the fire service, there has never been any issues with the family run business previously and he comes from a hard-working, law-abiding family.</p>
      <p>Miss Hedworth added: "At the time he didn't appreciate the risk.</p>
      <p>"He is completely and utterly remorseful for what has taken place."</p>
      <p>She said some of the fireworks were to be sold in the shop but others would have been used for Diwali celebrations and for weddings of friends and family.</p>
      <p>The court heard the shop does have an up to date licence for selling fireworks now.</p>
