      <h1>Muslim call for prayer recited in Amsterdam for first time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:28:28+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">ANADOLU AGENCY</a></address>
      <p>The Muslim call for prayer was recited on loudspeakers for the first time in Amsterdam Friday, according to a mosque official.</p>
      <p>The Blue Mosque had originally planned the Adhaan last Friday, but the cable of the audio system was cut by unidentified individuals.</p>
      <p>Mosque-goers and locals stood outside and recorded the emotional moment on their cell phones.</p>
      <p>Mosque spokesman Nourdeen Wildeman told Anadolu Agency that they were happy and honored to hear the Adhaan over the speakers despite the delay.</p>
      <p>Stating that 7% of the mosques in the Netherlands have been reciting the Adhaan over the speakers for years, Wildeman noted that it was the first time for the capital city.</p>
      <p>"There are different reactions from the locals. Some criticize it but in general the reactions are positive," he said.</p>
      <p>Ursula van Spronsen, a local, said she came to the mosque for the first time to hear the Adhaan and it sounded nice.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands where freedom of religion is protected by the Constitution, it is allowed for all religions to call its believers to worship by a law regulated in 1980.</p>
      <p>Under the law, the municipalities can limit the duration and volume of the Adhaan, but cannot ban it.</p>
      <p>There are around 500 mosques across the Netherlands.</p>
