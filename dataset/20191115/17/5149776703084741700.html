      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3541269">Forest</a> fans have already <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/another-sign-nottingham-forest-fans-3524865">sold-out their allocation</a> for next Saturday’s visit to fellow top-six hopefuls Bristol City, and now all 1,241 tickets have been shifted for the reunion with former manager Mark Warburton at QPR on November 27.</p>
      <p>After selling their allocation of tickets in the upper tier of the School End at the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium, another 1,000, this time in the lower tier, have also been given to Forest, with those expected to go in advance of the midweek visit to west London.</p>
