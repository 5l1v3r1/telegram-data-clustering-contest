      <h2>That BBQ Joint closed in February 2019</h2>

      <p>Clement Henriques, who opened the now-closed That BBQ Joint with his mother in October 2013, has launched a GoFundMe page to raise funds for a new mobile venture.</p>
      <p>That BBQ Joint closed in February 2019 after five years in business.</p>
      <p>"Sadly, the winter of 2018-19 proved to be the downfall of our small shop," Henriques wrote. "Often times, small businesses are literally living hand to mouth, and a couple few slow months can bring everything into perspective and it becomes decision time. We decided it was best to cut our losses and close."</p>
      <p>Henriques says owning and running a brick and mortar restaurant comes with challenges, so the next step is going mobile. According to the fundraiser, he is hoping to raise money for a truck, cart or both if possible.</p>
      <p>He says he has access to cooking space and equipment, but lacks the funding to get the business rolling.</p>
      <p>"I would love the opportunity to get back to doing what I am deeply passionate about and to try and continue what I looked at as a family legacy," he wrote.</p>
      <p>Henriques says he hopes to get the cart on the streets by next spring.</p>
