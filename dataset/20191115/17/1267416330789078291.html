      <p>Apple has removed all vaping related apps from its iOS App Store.</p>
      <p>The tech giant confirmed in a statement to <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-apple-to-remove-vaping-apps-from-store-8669fd94-e92a-4ce4-a9e2-ce5afa598b67.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top"><i>Axios</i></a> that its stringent App Store guidelines now ban software that encourages or helps people to vape.</p>
      <p>That said, if you already have a vaping app installed on your device, you’ll be able to continue using it and will be able to download it again, according to <i>Axios</i>.</p>
      <p>“Experts ranging from the CDC to the American Heart Association have attributed a variety of lung injuries and fatalities to e-cigarette and vaping products, going so far as to call the spread of these devices a public health crisis and a youth epidemic,” said an Apple spokesperson in a statement to <i>Axios</i>. “We agree, and we’ve updated our App Store Review Guidelines to reflect that apps encouraging or facilitating the use of these products are not permitted.”</p>
      <p>Apple’s ban on vaping apps follows widespread reports of vaping-related illnesses across the U.S. and Canada. The Ministry of Health has confirmed eight possible <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/vaping-outaouais-illness-health-1.5359645">vaping-related health cases in Canada</a>. In the United States, there have been more than 2,100 cases of vaping related health problems as of November 13th, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#latest-outbreak-information">CDC</a>.</p>
      <p>Apps designed to control cannabis-related vape products, such as the Pax Labs’ Pax 3 app, have also been <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/pax-mobile/id1119646621">banned from the iOS App Store</a>.</p>
      <p>Google has no comment regarding potential plans to ban vaping related products in the Play Store.</p>
      <p><b>Update 11/15/2019 3:35pm:</b> The story has been updated with comment from Google.</p>
