      <p>A Connecticut man who admitted raping a 13-year-old girl is expected to be sentenced to only six months in prison, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Travis Fernandes, 21, of Bridgeport, pleaded guilty on Thursday to fourth-degree sexual assault and reckless endangerment before Superior Court Judge Kevin Doyle, <a href="https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Bridgeport-man-faces-six-months-for-raping-14834642.php">the Connecticut Post reports</a>.</p>
      <p>But as part of a plea deal, he’s set to receive six months in prison and three years of probation when he’s sentenced on Jan. 14, the newspaper reports.</p>
      <p>A counselor at Bassick High School in Bridgeport told cops responding to a report of a sexual assault last December that she was treating a 13-year-old girl who was five months’ pregnant at the time, police said.</p>
      <p>The teen told investigators that Fernandes was the father of her child. She later gave birth to a daughter, the newspaper reports.</p>
      <p>Bridgeport police said Fernandes told detectives that he met the victim at a party in March 2018, some nine months earlier.</p>
      <p>The victim then invited Fernandes back to her home, he told police.</p>
      <p>“That’s when [the baby] was made, I suppose,” police said Fernandes told investigators.</p>
      <p>Attempts to reach Fernandes Friday were unsuccessful.</p>
