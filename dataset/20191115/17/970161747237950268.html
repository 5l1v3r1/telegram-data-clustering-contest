      <p>A mum left her three young children locked in a bedroom on her son’s birthday, so she could spend the night at a hotel with her partner, a court heard.</p>
      <p>The children – aged three, five and seven – were locked in the room with bucket, a roll of toilet paper and a plastic bag filled with snacks on the evening of September 15, 2017.</p>
      <p>They were also unable to leave the room, at the home in Blackburn, Lancashire, as the door handle had been removed, Preston Crown Court was told.</p>
      <p>Judge Philip Barry said the only source of light in the bedroom was a lamp with exposed wires, plugged into a damaged socket, causing a ‘clear fire hazard’.</p>
      <p>When officers were alerted to the situation and forced their way into the house, the five-year-old little girl told them: ‘Mummy has left us alone again’.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors said the alarm was raised by the children’s father, who is separated from their mother, after he became concerned she had left them alone.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old mum, who cannot be named for legal reasons, returned the next morning and was arrested at around 8am.</p>

      <p>She pleaded guilty to three offences of child neglect on November 14 and was given an 18-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said police found text messages on her phone that made it clear she had booked a room at a Holiday Inn Express, in Burnley, with a man she referred to as ‘babe’.</p>
      <p>She claimed she had asked her sister to look after the children but dumped them at home when the arrangements fell through.</p>
      <p>When officers arrived on the scene they could see a light on in a back bedroom so they broke in through the front door.</p>
      <p>Charles Brown, prosecuting, said the police could not immediately open the bedroom door and the youngsters could be heard crying inside.</p>
      <p>Their father, who was with the officers, asked them to stand clear of the door so police could break it down, the court heard.</p>
      <p>The children then spent the night with their father, but they are now cared for by the mother’s aunt and uncle, the court was told.</p>

      <p>Kelly Cyples, defending, said her client had been involved in an abusive relationship with the children’s father, which she had ended.</p>
      <p>But because she had married him against her family’s wishes, she was effectively isolated and had struggled with bringing the children up, she claimed.</p>
      <p>The mother must also complete 150 hours of community service and undertake 30 rehabilitation activity days.</p>
