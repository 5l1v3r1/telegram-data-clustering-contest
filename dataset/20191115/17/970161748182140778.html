      <p>Number plates advertising people’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> affiliations are selling for up to £1,500.</p>
      <p>Plenty of people want to show off their Remain or Leave credentials at the backs of their vehicles, and they’re going for plates such as EU20 BYE, EU20 POO or EU20 SAD.</p>
      <p>The next round of plates to be released are perfect for people to reveal their political leanings, as we are supposedly quitting the bloc in 2020.</p>
      <p>National Numbers spokesman James Russell told <b>Metro.co.uk</b> the company had received calls from people across the spectrum from people eager to get a personalised plate.</p>
      <p>Most people phoning in tend to be anti-Brexit but on Facebook there was a range.</p>
      <p>Mr Russell said: ‘Normally with private plates they often don’t spell out the word perfectly, but these are to the point.</p>

      <p>‘We have had a lot of enquiries.’</p>
      <p>Plates registered with 20 are available to buy now, but they can’t be put on cars until March next year. They will have to be put on new cars registered in 2020.</p>
      <p>Mr Russell said there were around 20 plates which related specifically to the EU, selling for between £500 and £1,500.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘EU20 FAN is my personal favourite.’</p>
      <p>Commenting on Facebook, Richard Percival wrote that EU20UKX (standing for UK exit) was a ‘belter’.</p>
      <p>But Dave Edge said: ‘Sooner scrap my car than put them [Remainer] plates on it… F**k the EU out out out.’</p>
