      <h3>The best wireless routers</h3>
      <p>We’ve compiled this list of our picks for the best wireless routers for you. (Image credit: Future)</p>
      <p>The best wireless routers are paramount for your online connection. It doesn’t matter if you’re battling gamers on the other side of the globe, trying to stream a movie in HD or just trying to get some work done. Nothing is more frustrating than a weak or intermittent internet connection and grabbing one of the best wireless routers for your home should be the first step.</p>
      <p>You won’t want to be diagnosing a bad internet connection in the midst of binging your favorite shows on Netflix or attempting to download the newest and best PC games. And while you might have your internet provider on speed dial (and ready to expand your service), installing one of the best wireless routers could be the solution to all your problems. You don’t want your router to be the bottleneck keeping your internet service chugging along at a snail’s pace.</p>
      <p>While getting the best wireless router money can buy might seem the way to go, needs might change from person to person. Maybe you will want the most cutting-edge hardware available, such as a wireless mesh router that can reach into every corner of your house. Or maybe you want an epic gaming router that can prioritize gaming-related network traffic. Or maybe you want to future proof your network with a router that can handle Wi-Fi 6 technology which should be making a big splash in the near future.</p>
      <p>While shopping for the best wireless routers, bear in mind a few things when comparing. If you have multiple devices in your home, which is probably the majority of people out there, you’ll want to make sure that the best wireless routers you’re looking at have MU-MIMO. It allows the router to communicate with those multiple devices all at once. Also, make sure to look at the speed rating of your chosen device – get one with at least a rated speed of AC1900.</p>
      <p>Finding the ideal router for you might seem to get tougher as there are more options to choose from than ever before. And while the options seem endless, we’ve compiled this list of our picks for the best wireless routers for your reference. We’ve tested these devices so you know they’re up to the task. Read on to find the best wireless router for your needs.</p>

      <p>The days of traditional wireless routers are coming to an end; the age of the wireless mesh routers is here. Google Wi-Fi, alone, is proof that the mesh revolution is upon us, which means that you might be saying goodbye to the days when the only way to have wireless bliss was to install a number of wireless extenders. The idea of Google Wi-Fi is simple: purchase a set of points, put them in strategic places around the house and then scan a QR code. And, just like that, you’re connected anywhere you are in your home. It’s no surprise that this wireless mesh router claims the loftiest spot on our best wireless routers list of 2019, as it’s also the one that’s most effortless to set up and get going.</p>

Sure, it comes with fewer antennae and ethernet ports than its higher end counterpart. However, it does deliver more than enough to provide very solid network coverage. Plus, the small form factor means that it will have no issues blending in­ – not that you will feel the need to hide it.</p>
