      <p><b>CLEVELANDÂ (AP)</b> - Cleveland police say they are not investigating Browns player Myles Garrett for striking a Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback in the head with a helmet.</p>
      <p>Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia (CHAWCH') said Friday that police hadn't received a complaint from Mason Rudolph.</p>
      <p>And a city spokeswoman says the prosecutor can't comment because Rudolph hasn't filed a complaint.</p>
      <p>Rudolph's agent, Tim Younger, tells media outlets that no legal options "have been removed from the table."</p>
      <p>Rudolph called Garrett's actions "pretty cowardly."</p>
      <p>Garrett pulled off Rudolph's helmet during a melee at the end of Thursday night's game in Cleveland and used it to strike him on the head.</p>
      <p>Garrett is the NFL's No. 1 overall pick in 2017 and was ejected from the game. The NFL on Friday suspended Garrett indefinitely.</p>
