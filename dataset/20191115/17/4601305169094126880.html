      <p>Nandi Bushell channels drummer David Grohl as she drums to Nirvana's "In Bloom."</p>
      <p>From Ipswich, England, she "has been posting drum covers to her YouTube channel for over two years. She's covered the likes of Beyoncé, Metallica, Joan Jett," according to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/9-year-old-girl-nandi-bushell-drums-nirvana-cover/">Mashable</a>. Is she really just nine years old?</p>
      <p>Here she is jamming with Lenny Kravitz earlier this year:</p>
