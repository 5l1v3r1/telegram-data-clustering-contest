      <h1>SAA Flights Cancelled Until Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:40:44+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/suzziegitau/" target="_blank">SG Editor</a></address>
      <p>The South African Airways (SAA) has extended its flight cancellation to Monday.</p>
      <p>The airlines said the latest move only affects domestic flights and those on the continent.</p>
      <p>Flights were initially halted for Friday and Saturday, but the airline adds that its hoping international flights will resume on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The disruption comes amid an indefinite strike by workers affiliated with the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca).</p>
      <p>The employees are demanding an 8% salary hike and are angry over the airline’s plans to lay off over 900 workers as part of its restructuring.</p>
      <p>Friday has already seen delays, confusion and frustration for some SAA passengers at OR Tambo International Airport.</p>
      <p>Scores of travellers have been standing in a queue for hours to get assistance from some employees who decided to show up for work on Friday.</p>
      <p>The national carrier had to use other subsidiary airlines due to the two-day strike.</p>
      <p>There was one SAA check-in counter operating in the early hours of Friday morning, serving a handful of customers.</p>
      <p>However, as the day progressed and the number of passengers increased, the airline opened other counters to attend to the slow-moving queue.</p>
      <p>Passengers flying domestically have been put on other flights but for most international travellers, it is a matter of waiting.</p>
      <p>SAA is expected to give an update by Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Still at the OR Tambo airport, police are out in their numbers including using four public order policing nyalas, the EMPD K9 Unit and police vans.</p>
      <p>Law enforcement came prepared to meet this group of striking employees.</p>
      <p>Workers came to Kempton Park early Friday morning but this time not to clock in for when their shift starts at 4 am but to put pressure on SAA to make drastic changes that won’t impact employees.</p>
      <p>Singing, dancing, waving flags, blowing vuvuzelas and beating a drum – the mood was jubilant.</p>
      <p>But the energy levels seem to be dwindling a bit around lunchtime compared to earlier.</p>
      <p>However, workers are adamant they are not prepared to back down from their demands, warning of putting even more pressure on SAA this weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CANCELLATION OF FLIGHTS ‘A RECKLESS DECISION’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Numsa and Sacca say SAA’s decision to extend flight cancellations showed their indefinite strike was working.</p>
      <p>Despite their numbers dwindling outside SA Airways Park, Numsa and Sacca leadership said their resolve was still strong.</p>
      <p>Workers are there with placards, in their trademark shirts, having a mini braai as the day goes by.</p>
      <p>Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said the latest move by SAA to cancel more flights motivated them.</p>
      <p>“It is absolutely the pressure of the strike. But this is not how you resolve a strike, call us, let’s sit down and work together because as far as we’re concerned, this is a reckless decision.”</p>
      <p>She added: “We’re certainly disappointed that this is the decision taken by management. This is a lot of money [that they’re going to lose], they’ve said themselves that it’s R52 million a day multiply by four, that’s much more than what we’re demanding in wages. Why don’t they just sit with us, so we can negotiate and find a way forward.”</p>
      <p>Unions and SAA management are expected to meet with the CCMA on Saturday in order to try to reach an agreement.</p>
