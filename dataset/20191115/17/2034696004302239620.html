      <h1>Robbie Williams and Tyson Fury (yes, really) praise Christmas parties in new song ‘Bad Sharon’</h1>

        <b>"Put on your glad rags / Go get off your face"</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/robbie-williams">Robbie Williams</a> has joined forces with boxing star Tyson Fury for ‘Bad Sharon’, the latest single from his forthcoming album <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/robbie-williams-the-christmas-present-sse-arena-2558776">‘The Christmas Present’</a>.</p>
      <p>The unlikely collaboration, which stemmed from the pair meeting in Las Vegas last year when Fury was set to face German boxer Tom Schwarz, hears Williams and Fury rattle through the highs and lows of drunken Christmas festivities. It transpires that ‘Bad Sharon’ is the woman “from the office” – elsewhere, the pair sing about stealing “the champagne” and getting “off your face’.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>‘Bad Sharon’ follows the songs ‘Merry Xmas Everybody’ feat. <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/jamie-cullum">Jamie Cullum</a>, ‘Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)’ feat. <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/bryan-adams">Bryan Adams</a>, and two new original tracks – ‘Let’s Not Go Shopping’ and ‘Rudolph’ – which have already been shared digitally.</p>

      <p>Williams’ festive double album, which is split into Christmas Past and Christmas Future, is released next Friday, November 22 via Columbia Records (<a href="https://www.robbiewilliams.com/">pre-order is available now</a>).</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/take-that">Take That</a> singer, who was in Las Vegas last year for a residency, said of his collaboration with Fury<i>: </i>“It was such an honour to meet [Fury] but to be able to do that [be in his dressing room pre-fight] was mind-blowing…In that moment it clicked in, I’ve seen him sing, he’s a huge character, huge personality, got a great voice, and I asked him right there and then and he said yes… His voice has got gravel, grit and personality.”</p>
      <p>The lead single from ‘The Christmas Present’, called ‘Time for Change’, is released next Friday when the album arrives, and will be accompanied by a new video shot by Vaughan Arnell.</p>
