      <p>Cities need to be redesigned to encourage environment friendly transport systems and in this context public transport plays a very effective role towards reducing pollution, said SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya on Friday.</p>
      <p>Modern civilisation and advanced societies are creating hazardous situations by causing damage to natural resources but the time has come to have relook at the urban planning itself. Environment studies needs to be imparted to all the sections of society, particularly incorporated into all the engineering courses, he said.</p>
      <p>The GM was participating in valedictory function of ‘National Green Rail’ seminar held here to bring enhanced awareness on environmental protection and energy conservation. He pointed out that Hyderabad was a city full of green environs in olden days, but now the green coverage is depleting except in Railway and Defence areas.</p>
      <p>“One unit of energy saved is equal to two units of energy production, SCR is according top priority to tap solar energy and conversation of water on a large scale,” he said.</p>
      <h3>MPs meeting</h3>
      <p>Earlier, Mr. Mallya held a meeting with MPs Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, and Badugula Lingaiah Yadav where he briefed them on various initiatives being taken towards green environment, water conservation, security and safety, among others. He also explained on progress of infrastructure facilities and improvement of passenger amenities.</p>
      <p>Among the MPs demands are stoppage of trains at Raigir station for convenience of passengers visiting Yadadri, introduction of MMTS train service to Yadadri and proposed for renaming of Raigir station as Yadadri.</p>
