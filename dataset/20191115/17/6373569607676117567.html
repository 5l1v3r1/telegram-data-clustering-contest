      <h1>Locals confused by 'ridiculous' traffic island blocking middle of road</h1>
      <h2>Baffled residents don't know where to go</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:37:05+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Dowrick</a></address>
      <p>Saltash residents say they are baffled at a 'ridiculous' new traffic island that appears to be dividing the road into two parts leaving it too small for cars to get through on one side.</p>
      <p>The traffic island near the Brunel Pub car park, at the junction of Culver Road and Victoria Road, has led to dozens of comments on social media from bemused and confused local residents trying to make sense of why it is there.</p>
      <p>Local resident Lisa-Marie Arnold says the island is 'hideous' and is confusing drivers as it's 'not clear'Â  whether drivers are now no longer permitted to turn right.</p>
      <p>There is still a white turn right arrow marked on the road itself - but it directs vehicles straight towards the new traffic island.</p>
      <p>There is enough of a gap for cyclists to get through but no cycle path markings appear in the road.</p>
      <p>Lisa-Marie told Plymouth Live: "It looks like the people that have done the work and placement have no clue.</p>
      <p>"If its been put there to stop the right-turn fair enough, but there's better ways if that's the case."</p>
      <p>"This island just looks like its been chucked there and thats it." she added.</p>

      <p>The traffic island, which appears to stand just a few metres from a pedestrian crossing, divides the road into two parts, but on the right-hand side of the island, the road is now too small for a vehicle.</p>
      <p>The island, which has a stay-left arrow, appears to block the right lane, but the stay-right arrow has not been removed.</p>
      <p>Photos of the island are now circling social media.</p>
      <p>Alongside a photo of the island, local resident Angie Janes joked: "Can someone please explain what in the f*** your [sic] supposed to do with that?!"</p>
      <p>Angie told Plymouth Live: "I'm as baffled as much as everyone else! I could have done a better job with my eyes closed!"</p>
      <p>"I'm also guessing that the road-marking people are a different department! And what is the dustcart going to do about getting around that [island]?" she added.</p>

      <p>It's believed the new road island was installed this week.</p>
      <p>Cornwall Council has been contacted for comment.</p>
