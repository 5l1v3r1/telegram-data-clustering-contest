      <h1>Florida at Missouri Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:05:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Florida Gators take on the Missouri Tigers this week, needing a win and a lot of help to get a spot in the SEC Championship Game.</p>
      <p>Florida is 8-2 on the season and 5-2 in the SEC, and are currently No. 11 in the <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/the-college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-11-have-been-released">College Football Playoff rankings</a>. With a loss to SEC East leader Georgia, the Gators would need Georgia to lose against both Auburn and Texas A&amp;M in order to take their spot in the SEC title game. But they’ll have to take care of business against Missouri for that to even be a factor. Fortunately for Florida, they have done a great job of taking care of business against just about everyone below them in the standings.</p>
      <p>Though not bowl eligible due to NCAA sanctions, Missouri is still hoping to finish with a third-straight winning season. The Tigers started off impressively enough, going 5-1 to start the season. But three straight road losses to Vanderbilt, Kentucky and Georgia have them at risk for a major meltdown in the final stretch of the season. They’ll have to hope senior quarterback Kelly Bryant can work his magic against one of the better teams in the country.</p>
      <p>Between Florida’s dominance and Missouri’s recent slump, it should come as no surprise that the Gators are favored in this one.</p>
