      <p>NEW ORLEANS (<a href="https://wgno.com/2019/11/14/nopd-man-pretended-to-be-handicapped-to-trick-home-care-workers-into-changing-his-diaper/">CNN</a>) — A New Orleans man has been arrested for pretending to be handicapped in order to have home health care workers change his adult diaper.</p>
      <p>Twenty-nine-year-old Rutledge Deas, who also goes by “Rory,” created multiple social media posts for home health care workers.</p>
      <p>Deas would specify in the ads that the services would be for his 18-year-old mentally and physically handicapped brother, “Cory.”</p>
      <p>Deas would then pose as “Cory” and pretend to be handicapped while the nurses changed his adult diaper, a process Deas used to “obtain sexual arousal,” according to the Louisiana State Police.</p>
      <p>Home healthcare workers became suspicious of the scheme on at least 10 separate occasions.</p>
      <p>Deas was arrested at his home without incident and charged with 10 counts of sexual battery and human trafficking (labor), and one count of possession of a schedule II controlled dangerous substance.</p>
      <p>The investigation remains ongoing, and additional victims are anticipated.</p>
      <p>Anyone suspected of being a victim of Deas is urged to contact LSP Detectives at <a href="tel:5043107000">(504) 310-7000</a>.</p>
