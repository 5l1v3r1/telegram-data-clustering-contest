      <h1>Freezing conditions at Nottingham Magistrates' Court as staff and defendants suffer six weeks without heating</h1>
      <h2>Nobody is happy about the situation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:28:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">Rod Malcolm</a></address>
      <p>A disabled man has sharply criticised a court for failing to fix the heating after six chilly weeks.</p>
      <p>Darren Winfield has undergone a knee transplant and said that the temperature was so bad that it left him in added pain.</p>
      <p>He was told to arrive at Nottingham Justice Centre at 9.15am for a brief hearing - and was left in the foyer for 90 minutes until his case was heard.</p>
      <p>Mr Winfield, 35, said: "I can't sit down because with my knee I would have trouble getting back up. That is what the cold does - it makes it worse and more painful.</p>
      <p>"You've got to feel sorry for the staff. They have to work here all day and it has been weeks. They get promises that it will be repaired but it isn't."</p>
      <p>His friend Ryan Parr, 32, added: "It's absolutely Baltic in here. I am disgusted that it has been left for six or seven weeks."</p>
      <p>And a woman due to face magistrates said: "I keep going into the ladies to use the hand dryer. It's the only way to warm up."</p>
      <p>The building houses around 10 magistrates' courts daily as well as immigration tribunals and some civil hearings. People have to wait in the glass-fronted atrium which is over 60ft tall.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, magistrates have worn overcoats in court - and some staff have been carrying hot water bottles.</p>
      <p>While emergency heaters have been brought into courtrooms and some offices, the temperature remains nippy in them and even colder in the foyer.</p>
      <p>After a series of internal complaints, several notices were posted saying: "HM Courts and Tribunal Service. We are sorry the heating is not working. We are working with our contractors to have it fixed as soon as possible. Justice matters."</p>
      <p>Now a relative of one centre worker has outlined his worries about the health of staff.</p>
      <p>He said: "The heating system in the building has been broken for more than six weeks.</p>
      <p>"Because of the cold and damp weather, the temperature in some court rooms has been recorded at only 13 degrees and in the main atrium even colder.</p>
      <p>"Under UK employment laws, there is no legislated minimum temperature in which staff should no longer be asked to work, although under health and safety regulations the employer has a duty of care to employees.</p>
      <p>"The management have tried to address this issue with electric heaters. But the building is so large and the electrical system so inadequate they make virtually no difference other than in the enclosed space of the administration office.</p>
      <p>"This results in the legal staff - judges, lawyers, legal advisors and ushers - working in extremely cold conditions in some cases all day long.</p>
      <p>"I am concerned about their health working in such cold conditions. It may continue for several weeks."</p>
      <p>A HM Courts and Tribunals spokesman said: "Work has begun to repair a fault in the heating system at Nottingham Justice Centre.</p>
      <p>“Temporary heaters are in place and the building remains fully operational.”</p>
      <p>The repairs are expected to be finished by the end of November and officials plan to monitor the temperature.</p>
      <p>Experts say a special part was needed to solve the problem.</p>
