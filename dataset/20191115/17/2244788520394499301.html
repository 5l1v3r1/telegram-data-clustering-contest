        <b>ARRANGEMENT has been concluded for operatives of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to monitor the upcoming governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States on 16th November 2019 for vote buying and selling, as well as other corruption-related practices.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The commission made this disclosure today in a press release obtained by <b>The ICIR.</b></p>
      <p>These infractions contravene sections 8 and 9 in addition to other relevant provisions of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000 prohibiting the corrupt.</p>
      <p>According to the ICPC, the monitoring exercise is in response to the invitation by the Chairman of the Independent National Election Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, for ICPC to participate in ridding the electoral processes in Nigeria of corrupt practices.</p>
      <p>“This intervention is also in furtherance of ICPC’s current strategy of engaging in exercises that have macro rather than the micro impact on various sectors of the country for the benefit of the generality of citizens as it is doing with Constituency Projects tracking and highway corruption where sundry acts of corruption are being tackled with commendable results.</p>
      <p>“The Commission’s operatives have therefore been primed to deal appropriately with perpetrators of any acts of corruption in accordance with the law, no matter their social status in both gubernatorial elections.</p>
      <p>“Voters in both states are therefore enjoined to go out on Election Day and perform their civic obligations, while eschewing all acts that can make them run afoul of the law.”</p>
