      <p>LONDON — Is the British government about to become the world's next big tech giant?</p>
      <p>That's definitely what the Labour Party has in mind after it <a href="https://labour.org.uk/press/british-broadband-labour-sets-out-mission-to-connect-communities-across-britain-by-delivering-free-full-fibre-broadband-for-all/">announced plans</a> to nationalize most of the country's broadband industry, invest more than £20.3 billion to create a nationwide high-speed network and tax the likes of Google and Facebook to pay for its upkeep.</p>
      <p>As if that were not enough, all Brits would then get free internet access.</p>
      <p>The promise has certainly generated publicity for Labour, which is <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">trailing in the polls</a> ahead of a December election. But it has also prompted plenty of head-scratching about feasibility, with backers hailing the plan as a potential engine for growth, and detractors — including most of the tech industry — warning it would lead to "broadband communism."</p>
      <p>The truth lies somewhere in between.</p>
      <aside>New investment, and lots of it, is needed to bring the U.K. up to speed with its global competitors.</aside>
      <p>Labour's radical plan to invest in the United Kingdom's internet infrastructure makes economic sense in at least one regard: Just like railroads in the 19th century, broadband networks have become a basic requirement for economic growth in the digital age. It's a determining factor in whether a country will be able to compete in an increasingly intense global competition for technological superiority, the digital Great Game.</p>
      <p>From the outset, the U.K. political party's plans make economic sense.</p>
      <p>Broadband investment across the 35 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development led, on average, to a 0.3 percent annual boost to countries' gross domestic product over the past 15 years, according to a <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/telecoms-research/broadband-research/economic-impact-broadband">report for Ofcom</a>, the U.K.'s telecommunications regulator. In Britain, the economic benefit was even stronger, with a cumulative increase of around 5.3 percent of GDP over the same period, as improved access to high-speed internet bolstered wealth creation online.</p>
      <p>So Labour's plan rests on a well-founded idea — that greater broadband usage, on average, leads to greater economic prosperity. And there is clearly room for improvement in the U.K.</p>
      <p>Existing broadband penetration (based on the percentage of households that have access to such services) is higher in Britain than the European average. But the country lags behind many of its European Union neighbors, as well as Japan and South Korea.</p>
      <p>Countries like Spain and Portugal have a penetration rate of over 70 percent for so-called "fiber-to-the-home" networks, the next generation of broadband networks that involve running internet cables directly to people's homes, according to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/connectivity">figures from IHS</a>, the data provider.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Britain has less than 5 percent of homes connected to such ultra-fast networks, which are increasingly important in the build-out of next generation mobile services known as 5G. (The U.K. broadband coverage rate is increasing rapidly, though, as telecom providers compete to keep up with growing demand.)</p>
      <p>New investment, and lots of it, is needed to bring the U.K. up to speed with its global competitors. (Both the existing British government and local companies have already pledged billions of pounds.)</p>
      <p>But Labour's plan risks delivering a death blow to an industry that would otherwise be providing that investment. It also flies in the face of decades of experience in countries from Japan to the United States that have been successful in building out their high-speed digital infrastructure.</p>
      <p>In the early 2000s, for instance, policymakers in Tokyo realized that a national broadband network was key to the country's future economic prospects.</p>
      <p>But instead of putting the project into the government's hands, Japanese lawmakers instead <a href="https://www.itif.org/files/2008BBAppendixD.pdf">offered subsidies, tax incentives, and low-interest loans</a> to existing broadband providers — a bonanza that triggered more than 200 privately-funded projects which, in turn, delivered high-speed broadband to some 30 million households in only a couple of years. Similarly in South Korea — where internet speeds routinely finish at the top of global rankings — officials relied on government incentives to private companies (including allowing the state telecoms monopoly to go public earlier than expected if it hit broadband rollout goals) to create a high-speed network that would make most Brits green with envy.</p>
      <p>And the list goes on.</p>
      <p>From Portugal to France to the United States, policymakers, often wary of relying on private companies to provide essential nationwide infrastructure, have leveraged the state's economic might through government loans, subsidies and other financial incentives to roll out high-speed broadband. Community initiatives like <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/truespeed-digital-divide-europe-broadband-fiber-telecom-rural/">this one I visited last year in rural England</a> are also filling the void where national lawmakers have been slow to act.</p>

      <p>Already, British telecoms providers are crying foul, warning that billions of pounds of investment could be wiped out if their networks have to compete with government-backed infrastructure that offers high-speed internet to the masses for free. There are also significant competition concerns that Labour's plans may run aground due to antitrust fears related to rivals being outmuscled from the market.</p>
      <p>Supporters of Labour's plans would likely say that existing private efforts, most notably to bring high-speed broadband to the countryside, have been too slow, too expensive and too cumbersome. The U.K. government, they argue, would be better suited to the task.</p>
      <p>But Brits should be careful what they wish for.</p>
      <p>Greater access to digital infrastructure would be a much needed boost to the U.K. economy at a time of ongoing uncertainty linked to the country's pending departure from the European Union.</p>
      <p>But by going down the nationalization route where other countries have almost exclusively relied on incentivizing private investment, Labour is entering uncharted territory — one that would set the U.K. apart from its global peers in revamping its economy for the digital world.</p>
