      <h1>Kweku Smoke and manager allegedly attacked by Shatta Wale’s boys over song theft accusation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:31:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>The drama between Shatta Wale and Kumasi-based artiste, Kweku Smoke seem to have taken a wrong turn as report reaching us indicates that the SM boss has allegedly sent his thugs to attack Kweku Smoke and his manager over the earlier song theft accusation by the latter.</p>
      <p>This was made known through a video made by Kweku Smoke.</p>
      <p>According to the ‘Yedin’ crooner, while en-route to Shatta Wale’s house with his manager to get the matter settled, they were attacked by some hood boys who were arranged by the ‘Mellisa’ singer to beat them up.</p>
      <p>In the video, Kweku Smoke who is seen with a bandage on his hand and neck with a low tone voice revealed that the car they were in was smashed by the thugs as well.</p>
      <p>Kweku Smoke who appeared injured from the bandages around his arm and neck threatened to arrest Shatta Wale adding that he’s not faking his assault for hype.</p>
      <p>Nana Boroo has however waded into the ongoing beef, <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/beef-alert-ill-cut-off-your-gangster-wings-i-swear-nana-boroo-threatens-shatta-wale/">threatening to deal with Shatta Wale for attacking his manager and Kweku Smoke and smashing the Mercedez Benz 2018</a> car they were using.</p>
      <p>The brouhaha between Kweku Smoke and Shatta Wale started when <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/busted-kweku-smoke-accuses-shatta-wale-of-stealing-his-song/">Kweku Smoke in a self-recorded video stated that Shatta Wale stole his song after he gave a copy of the song to him to add his silky voice to it</a> but it turned out that Shatta twisted the song and now claiming it’s his.</p>
      <p>Kweku Smoke in the video asked Shatta Wale to be careful with his diabolic moves adding that he doesn’t want to be signed by him after Wale revealed his interest of getting him to work with him.</p>
      <p>Shatta Wale in an earlier report this morning, responded to Kweku Smoke’s allegations and asked <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/shatta-wale-finally-breaks-silence-after-kweku-smoke-accused-him-of-stealing-his-song/">Kweku Smoke to keep his mouth shut over what he described as a fabricated lie</a> to tarnish his image.</p>
