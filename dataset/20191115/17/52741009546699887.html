      <p>TORONTO — A Toronto woman accused of throwing a chair off a downtown high-rise balcony has pleaded guilty to mischief causing danger to life.</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old Marcella Zoia made the plea in a packed Toronto courtroom this morning, acknowledging she was the woman seen in a video that went viral in February.</p>
      <p>A sentencing hearing has been scheduled for Jan. 14.</p>
      <p>Crown prosecutors say they will seek a six-month prison sentence in the case.</p>
      <p>Zoia's lawyer, Greg Leslie, said he would seek a suspended sentence, saying six months in prison was too harsh for a woman his client's age.</p>
      <p>Leslie said he expected two other charges against Zoia in the incident would be dropped.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 15, 2019.</p>
