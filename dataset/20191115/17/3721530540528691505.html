      <p><i>Factorio </i>technically came out in 2016, but it was only in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20961896/decade-of-early-access-minecraft-star-citizen-fortnite">early access</a>. Since then, developer Wube Software has been working on the full release of the hit factory-management sim. Now, in a remarkable moment of candor, it says it’s all simply taking too long. Wube is trimming the feature list and setting a 1.0 release date for Sept. 25, 2020.</p>
      <p>This announcement came in a <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-321">post written by one of the game’s directors Michal “Kovarex” Kovařík</a>. Kovařík says while the team’s “it is done when it is done” approach has served the company well, it couldn’t be that way forever.</p>
      <p>“A lot of us don’t have any problem working on <i>Factorio </i>for some more time,” Kovařík says. “But the main problem is, that we would like to introduce new features and content instead of just polishing parts that are already present in the game.”</p>
      <p>Instead of trying to fit every feature in, the team will focus on getting the important changes in before February. If a feature doesn’t make it, the team can always add it later. The main focus from Wube Software seems to be ironing out as many little issues in <i>Factorio </i>as possible before release.</p>
      <p>“The game is quite polished now,” Kovařík says. “If we just pushed the button to release 1.0, it wouldn’t be a catastrophe. From our perspective a lot of things wouldn’t be finished, but from the perspective of new players, the things we are working on now are mainly nitpicks.”</p>
      <p>Kovařík is also careful to note that releasing the 1.0 isn’t the same thing as finishing the game. He says that after <i>Factorio</i>’s 1.0 release, the team will take a short rest then focus on building content and features for the game. As for what this future content may look like, Kovařík says we’ll have to wait until the official release is actually here to know.</p>
      <p>Thankfully for fans, and Wube themselves, the wait for the full release of <i>Factorio </i>shouldn’t be too hard. After all the early access version of the game is still available, just as it has been since 2016.</p>
