      <h1>Hearts make £1.6m operating profit as Ann Budge announces financial results</h1>
      <h2>The Jambos have had a turbulent time on the field, but off it they appear in rude health.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:07:45+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:07</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Temple</a></address>
      <p>Hearts have announced a profit of £1.6 million for the financial year ending June 30, largely due to the contribution of £3.25 million from unnamed benefactors.</p>
      <p>An ‘exceptional donation’ of £1 million was made towards player costs, while the club received a further £2.25 million from the anonymous source which was put towards the redevelopment of Tynecastle Park.</p>
      <p>Despite owner <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> lamenting a ‘disappointing’ final <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> position of sixth in the 2018/19 campaign, Hearts’ turnover increased by more than 20 per cent from £12.1 million to £15.1 million compared to the previous year.</p>
      <p>This reflected a 31 per cent increase in commercial activities, the Jambos’ strong performance in both national cup competitions and the receipt of more than £500,000 in players sales - most notably <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kyle-lafferty">Kyle Lafferty</a> ’s protracted move to Rangers last August.</p>

      <p>Fans’ group Foundation of Hearts [FoH] continued to make progress towards fan ownership by contributing another £1.32 million to Budge’s BIDCO (1874) Ltd company over the course of the year.</p>
      <p>FoH, who already have two representatives on the board, are scheduled to formally take control of the club in the Spring of 2020.</p>
      <p>However, much of that income was offset by substantial payments of £3.6 million made in connection to the Tynecastle Redevelopment Fund, which includes the completion of Tynecastle’s new Main Stand.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Staff costs rose from £7 million to £8.2 million, operating charges went up from £6.1 million to £6.5 million and a combined total of £1.7 million in loans were reimbursed to Budge.</p>
      <p>Signing off on the accounts, which show <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> boast net assets totalling £17.5 million, Budge wrote: “It was another challenging year both on and off the pitch, however, we continued to focus on our core values and have delivered a very positive financial performance.</p>
      <p>“This bodes very well for the future.”</p>
