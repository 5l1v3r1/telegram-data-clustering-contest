      <h4>Quick Take</h4>
      <p>A meme circulating on Facebook exaggerates the role played by President Donald Trump in funding a 1995 Veterans Day parade in New York. He donated $200,000, which was less than 10% of the total raised, according to press reports at the time.</p>

      <h4>Full Story</h4>
      <p>When President Donald Trump was a real estate developer in New York City in 1995, he donated money to an organization hosting a parade in the city on Veterans Day.</p>
      <p>That fact has been exaggerated in a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRightChoiceUSA/photos/a.270091587203864/397345934478428/?type=3&amp;theater">meme</a> that claims: “25 years ago, the City of New York refused to fund the Veterans Day Parade. Donald Trump financed it!”</p>
      <p>Trump didn’t pay for all of it, but he did make a contribution that organizers credited with jump-starting their fundraising.</p>
      <p>“Donald Trump saved the parade,” the parade director <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/11/11/More-than-500000-watch-Nations-Parade/4721816066000/">reportedly said</a> at the time. <a href="https://apnews.com/845a0bc38b3506b6e30ed74335ae5f57">News</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiM6oXE2uzlAhWETN8KHY9FAWgQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F1995%2F11%2F12%2Fnyregion%2Fon-parade-to-the-beat-of-history.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw09XJgUXceGnfWPRYU1Fo0O">stories</a> put Trump’s donation at $200,000 and the total cost of the parade at more than $2 million. One <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjR3N-64OzlAhXqdN8KHaD7AkoQFjAAegQIBBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F1995%2F11%2F10%2Fnyregion%2Fveterans-day-parade-tries-for-a-comeback.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw2qWjZfEij92TSzAgawEkEr">story</a> also said Trump, who was the <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/grand-marshal-of-the-nations-parade-donald-trump-speaks-to-news-photo/773626?adppopup=true">grand</a> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/grand-marshal-of-the-nations-parade-donald-trump-his-family-news-photo/773583?adppopup=true">marshal</a> of the parade, was given the honor in exchange for his donation.</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171005094113/https://www.trumponstern.com/episode/auto-draft-22/">explained in his own words</a> how he became the grand marshal during an appearance on “The Howard Stern Show” two days before the parade.</p>
      <blockquote><b>Robin Quivers,</b> <b>Nov. 9, 1995:</b> How’d you get to be the grand marshal?<br/><br/><b>Trump:</b> Well, it seems that they went to numerous corporate people in America and a lot of people didn’t step up to the plate.<br/><br/><b>Stern:</b> And you did.</blockquote>
      <p>The organization that hosted the event, the <a href="https://uwvc.org/">United War Veterans Council</a>, didn’t return our calls and the nonprofit organization’s <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/displayAll.do?dispatchMethod=displayAllInfo&amp;Id=63881&amp;ein=133793337&amp;country=US&amp;deductibility=all&amp;dispatchMethod=searchAll&amp;isDescending=false&amp;city=&amp;ein1=&amp;postDateFrom=&amp;exemptTypeCode=al&amp;submitName=Search&amp;sortColumn=orgName&amp;totalResults=1&amp;names=United+War+Veterans+Council&amp;resultsPerPage=25&amp;indexOfFirstRow=0&amp;postDateTo=&amp;state=All+States">tax forms</a> from that year aren’t available online. But press reports at the time estimated Trump’s donation to be $200,000, and said that he helped raise more from other businesses.</p>
      <p>His participation in the parade was a point of pride for Trump, who did not serve in the military himself. As a candidate for president in 2015, Trump was asked how he had “best demonstrated patriotism.” He called his role in the parade “<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/07/04/united-states-presidential-candidates-patriotism-july-fourth/29688615/">one of my proudest accomplishments</a>.”</p>
