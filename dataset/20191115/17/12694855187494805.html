        <b>eBay <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-3934683">Black Friday</a> Deals: When it comes to the best Black Friday deals, eBay likes to do it with juicy discount codes that save consumers up to 20% off a whole host of incredible gadgets and gizmos.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Whilst we’re still waiting for some of the top retailers to unveil their Black Friday offers (Amazon, we’re looking at you), eBay is finally weighing in on the biggest sales period of the year. The biggest online marketplace has launched its first in what we imagine will be a series of early Black Friday discount codes.</p>
      <p>Yes, when quoting <b>PRIZE20 </b>right now you can save at a number of retailers and sellers on eBay across the usual variety of products, including smart watches, tablets, headphones and so much more. Running until midnight on November 21<sup>st</sup>, we imagine this will be the first of many discount codes from eBay over the Black Friday and <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-3934683">Cyber Monday</a> period.</p>
      <p>Please be aware the <b>PRIZE20 </b>discount code can only be used once per buyer and gives consumers a maximum discount of £75 on minimum spends of at least £25.</p>
      <h3>Our favourite eBay Black Friday Deal</h3>
      <p>Calling all audiophiles. You can now pick up the Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX wireless noise cancelling headphones for a surprisingly low price. Usually retailing at £329.99, these Bowers &amp; Wilkins headphones sit well and truly in the premium bracket when it comes to the headphone god tier. However, right now, when using the 20% off eBay discount code <b>PRIZE20</b>, you can pick up this already reduced listing for £207.99.</p>
      <p>Saving well over the £100 mark for a set of headphones that come Trusted Reviews recommended, the Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX wireless headphones do indeed pack a lot of incredible tech. Bringing you ingenious noise cancelling technology, you can switch between three modes to let in and block out as much as you want.</p>
      <p>‘City’ mode is designed to ensure your safety, still able to hear traffic as you roam from A to B. ‘Office’ mode, meanwhile, is ideal for when you’re at work and still need to be clued in when a colleague is trying to grab your attention. Its maximum noise cancelling level is ‘Flight’ mode, able to block out even the most roaring of aeroplane engines as you sink into a long haul flight.</p>
      <p>Quick pairing is also something to shout about with the B&amp;W PX headphones, incorporating smart sensors meaning they’ll know when they’re slipped on and off, playing and pausing your music for an even more streamlined listening experience.</p>
      <p>Completely wireless with both Bluetooth and noise cancelling on, we found the headphones to last about 22 hours, which is no bad thing. When not using noise cancellation, you can enjoy up to 29 hours. Utilise the cables and you can expect 50 hours of playback time.</p>
      <p>A great pair, we awarded them a 10 out of 10 rating. Now down to £207.99, this is a price to seriously consider jumping at before they go out of stock or the code expires November 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>

      <h4>What is eBay’s returns policy?</h4>
      <p>That’s a very good question – and there’s no single answer, given the fact that eBay simply acts as an intermediary between the buyers and sellers of various products.</p>
      <p>This means there isn’t an overarching rule that covers the entire marketplace, but rather that individual sellers dictate their own return policies. Typically, larger retailers that operate on eBay, such as Argos, will offer a guarantee of at least 14 days.</p>
      <p>However, when you’re buying from a smaller seller they could opt for a No Returns policy that means you won’t be able to get your money back if you simply change your mind.</p>
      <p>As a result, you should always check the fine print before buying something on eBay – every item up for sale on the site clearly displays the return policy of its seller on the listing page.</p>
      <p>Faulty products are covered by eBay’s Money Back Guarantee, so you can still shop with confidence that you won’t be sold a lemon. Refunds requested for this reason can take some time to process, though, and you’ll only be eligible for one if you paid via PayPal.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>Does eBay offer student discount?</h4>
      <p>eBay does not offer a student discount scheme – but that’s not to say students can’t find a great deal on eBay. Far from it.</p>
      <p>The whole point of eBay is to help people save money and make money in equal measure, which means it’s a great place to shop for cheap wares, especially if you’re happy with second-hand or refurbished goods.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s finding a TV to pimp your new student digs, a laptop to help you complete your coursework, or the books you might need to actually learn some stuff in the first place, eBay is a great place to look.</p>
      <p>Be sure to check the RRP (regular retail price) of the items you’re after first, to make sure you’re not entering an unnecessary bidding war – and note the condition that items are being offered in so you’re not disappointed on arrival.</p>
      <p>Provided you’re happy with those two things – and the returns policy, as previously mentioned – you could be one of the countless students who have used eBay to bag a bargain over the years. Ourselves included.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>Does eBay offer a trade-in scheme?</h4>
      <p>Yes – eBay is arguably the best known trade-in scheme on the planet, though it works a little bit differently from passing on your unwanted goods to mainstream retailers like John Lewis or Currys.</p>
      <p>Where these outfits let you trade-in your old kit to get a discount off an equivalent item – trading in an old iPhone for money off a new one, for instance – eBay lets you sell practically anything that’s legal.</p>
      <p>Some of the things commonly sold on eBay include old tech – phones, laptops, TVs etc – as well as clothing, cosmetics and even cars.</p>
      <p>Sure, it’s a slightly more laborious process than simply heading down to the High Street with your scraggly old phone to buy a new one for a bit less than the asking price, but it offers you a huge amount of flexibility. Put the cash against an equivalent item, stash it away for a rainy day, blow it down the pub on a Friday – the choice is entirely yours.</p>
      <p>In fact, many people make a living – or at least an extra crust – selling stuff on eBay, and there’s nothing stopping you from joining their ranks.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>Does eBay offer click and collect?</h4>
      <p>You have the option to use a click and collect service when shopping with eBay, though not all sellers will participate in it. As with pretty much all aspects of shopping eBay, your click and collect mileage will vary depending on who you’re buying from.</p>
      <p>The marketplace’s official business seller partners – retailers like Argos – will often give you the option of collecting from one of their outlets. Sainsbury’s stores can also be utilised in a similar vein as can Collect+ shops, of which over 3,500 exist in the UK.</p>
      <p>This means click and collect is definitely possible when shopping with eBay, but check before you buy – the option should be clearly flagged by the seller on the listing page of the item.</p>
      <p>Likewise, your delivery options for eBay purchases will be dictated by the seller, so read the fine print before sealing the deal. This is especially important if you’re hoping for something to arrive before a specific date – Christmas, anyone? – as independent sellers may not deliver as quickly as mainstream retailers.</p>
