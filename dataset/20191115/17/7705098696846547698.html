      <h1>Official Birds of Prey Synopsis Adds New Plot Details</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:21:12+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>Thanks to the announcement of an <b><a href="https://www.talenthouse.com/i/create-artwork-for-birds-of-prey">art competition</a></b>, a new <b><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/birds-of-prey">Birds of Prey</a> </b>synopsis has made its way online. In addition to adding some new details, this seems to confirm several plot points fans speculated about in the past. The most interesting news is that <b><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/harley-quinn">Harley Quinn</a></b> seems to actually narrate the story as it unfolds on screen (perhaps unreliably?). The new <b>Birds of Prey </b>synopsis reads as follows:</p>
      <p>“You ever hear the one about the cop, the songbird, the psycho and the mafia princess? <b>Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</b> is a twisted tale told by Harley herself, as only Harley can tell it. When Gotham’s most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her. Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya’s paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.”</p>

      <p>There is another interesting plot point that this seemingly confirms. Even though no one yet knows the reason why, someone already guessed that Ewan McGregor’s Black Mask would hunt for young Cassandra Cain.</p>
      <p>Margot Robbie will reprise her <b>Suicide Squad</b> role of Harley Quinn in the film, which also stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary, Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain, Ewan McGregor as the villain Black Mask, Chris Messina as Victor Zsasz, and Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya. Additionally, Ali Wong (<b>Fresh Off the Boat</b>), Robert Catrini (<b>American Crime Story</b>), Steven Williams (<b>IT</b>), and Derek Wilson (<b>Preacher</b>) round out the ensemble.</p>
      <p>Cathy Yan (<b>Dead Pigs</b>) will direct the spin-off, making her the first female Asian director to helm a superhero film. Christina Hodson (<b>Bumblebee</b>) penned the script.</p>
      <p><b>Birds of Prey</b> opens in theaters on February 7, 2020. What do you think about the new <b>Birds of Prey </b>synopsis? Let us know in the comments section below.</p>
