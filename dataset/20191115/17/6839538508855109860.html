      <p>As the Ukraine ambassador told an impeachment hearing that she felt “very intimidated” by Donald Trump, the US president launched a scathing attack against her on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Ms Yovanovitch said she received the call at 1am from an official who said she needed to come home right away. The person said there were concerns about her security.</p>
      <p>She asked if that meant her physical security. The person said no.</p>
      <p>Ms Yovanovitch said this was “extremely irregular” and she argued. But she eventually returned, where she learned that US President Donald Trump no longer wanted her to serve.</p>

      <p>Contributing her testimony as a witness to the Trump impeachment hearings, Ms Yovanovitch says she had a reputation for championing anti-corruption interests in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Ms Yovanovitch, who was recalled last spring from her job as US ambassador to Ukraine, said under questioning from Representative Adam Schiff that that work may have upset certain officials in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>She says State Department officials tried to produce a statement of support for her after her abrupt recall from her post, but she was told that effort was unsuccessful because the officials feared their message would be undercut by the president.</p>

      <p>She says she was told that she had lost the president’s confidence and flew from Ukraine on the same day as the inauguration of Ukraine’s president.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump responded to her testimony by attacking her on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Noting her postings in the foreign service, Mr Trump said with a note of sarcasm and sexism: “She started off in Somalia, how did that go?”</p>
      <p>But Ms Yovanovitch is a career foreign service officer with a solid reputation. She testified on Friday that she was the victim of “a campaign of disinformation” that used “unofficial back channels” leading to her removal from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Ms Yovanovitch told Congress that attacks from corrupt interests created a crisis at the State Deptartment and that she was the victim of “a campaign of disinformation” that used “unofficial back channels” leading to her removal from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>She said it “continues to amaze” her that Americans partnered with “Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old corrupt rules” in pushing for her removal.</p>

      <p>Ms Yovanovitch also sounded the alarm that senior State Department officials did not defend her from attacks from the president’s allies, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.</p>
      <p>The new testimony came after Mr Trump said the impeachment probe had been “very hard” on his family, even as he held a “Keep America Great” rally in conservative stronghold Louisiana.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Republican-friendly territory in a state he carried in 2016 by 20 percentage points, Mr Trump lashed out on Thursday at Democratic investigators and what he called a “deranged impeachment witch hunt.”</p>
      <p>While arguing it was a political boon for his re-election, he acknowledged for the first time a personal toll from the <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/0752fd62d40eaee44a5a8bc0200f101e">impeachment process</a> that stands to cloud his legacy.</p>
      <p>“I have one problem,” Mr Trump said. “Impeachment to me is a dirty word, it’s been very unfair, very hard on my family.”</p>

      <p>The House began public impeachment hearings on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump repeated his denials of wrongdoing in his dealings with Ukraine, asserting he had no need to ask that nation to investigate former US Vice President Joe Biden and his family.</p>
      <p>“We took down Bush, Clinton, Obama, with no experience, but I had you and we won,” Mr Trump said of his 2016 victory.</p>
      <p>“Think about that and then think about me – ‘Gee, let’s get some help from Ukraine in order to beat sleepy Joe Biden.’ I don’t think so.”</p>
      <p>He added, “The people of this country aren’t buying it,” claiming polls show a benefit to Republicans as Democrats focus on impeachment.</p>

      <p>“We did nothing wrong,” Mr Trump insisted, “and they’re doing nothing.”</p>
      <p>It comes as Mr Trump released the summary transcript of an April congratulatory call with Ukrainian President-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday.</p>
      <p>It is the latest salvo in the White House struggle to blunt Democrats’ contention that Mr Trump abused the power of the presidency.</p>
      <p>The focus of the Democratic-led House impeachment inquiry has been on another call between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskiy that was made on July 25.</p>
      <p>In that call, Mr Trump asked Ukraine’s president to do him “a favour” and look into the actions of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.</p>
      <p>The memo recaps the short April call in which Mr Trump congratulates Mr Zelenskiy on his election.</p>
      <p>There is no mention of Mr Biden or corruption but Mr Trump does note that he once hosted the Miss Universe contest in Ukraine.</p>

      <p>Louisiana has the last of three Southern governor’s races this year, all targets of intense interest from the Republican party and Donald Trump. While Republicans kept the seat in Mississippi, they lost Kentucky’s governorship, with Republican incumbent Matt Bevin conceding the race on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Smarting from the Kentucky outcome, Mr Trump has turned his focus to Louisiana and defeating John Bel Edwards, the Deep South’s only Democratic governor.</p>
      <p>Arguing for Mr Edwards’ removal, Mr Trump told the crowd that while the nation is doing great economically, Louisiana isn’t. He said it’s at the bottom for economic development while at the top for murders, adding, “You’re doing lousy compared to others.”</p>

      <p>“If you want to defend your values, your jobs, and your freedom, then you need to replace radical John Bel Edwards with a true Louisiana patriot, Eddie Rispone,” Mr Trump said at the rally in north Louisiana’s Bossier City.</p>
      <p>Mr Rispone, owner of an industrial contracting firm, spent millions on the race said, “What Trump has done for our country has been phenomenal. … The economy is booming in the United States, but it’s not booming in Louisiana. We’re falling behind,” Rispone said at an event in Baton Rouge. “We want to do for Louisiana what Trump has done for the nation.”</p>

      <h3>WHY AN OUSTED AMBASSADOR TESTIFIED</h3>
      <p>Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine was targeted by the president’s allies in a “smear” campaign now central to the inquiry.</p>
      <p>The career diplomat, who served both Republican and Democratic presidents, is now testifying publicly in the historic House hearings that Democrats are now relying on to make the case that the president’s behaviour is impeachable.</p>
      <p>In particular, Ms Yovanovitch and others have described Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump’s personal lawyer, as leading what one called an “irregular channel” outside the diplomatic mainstream of US-Ukraine relations.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Asked during her closed-door deposition if anyone at the State Department who was alerted to Mr Giuliani’s role tried to stop him, she testified, “I don’t think they felt they could.”</p>
      <p>With the second day of historic hearings to consider removal of America’s 45th president, Democrats and Republicans are hardening their messages to voters as they try to saw public opinion.</p>
      <p>Americans are deeply entrenched in two camps over impeachment, resulting in a mounting political battle that will further test the nation in one of the most polarising eras of modern times.</p>

      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi brushed aside the Latin phrase “quid pro quo” that Democrats have been using to describe Mr Trump’s actions with a more colloquial one: Bribery.</p>
      <p>“Quid pro quo: Bribery,” Ms Pelosi said about Mr Trump’s July 25 phone call in which he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a favour.</p>
      <p>In the phone conversation, Mr Trump asked for a “favour,” according to an account provided by the White House.</p>
      <p>He wanted an investigation of Democrats and 2020 rival Joe Biden. Later it was revealed that the administration was also withholding military aid from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections,” Ms Pelosi said. “That’s bribery.” It’s also spelled out in the Constitution as one of the possible grounds for impeachment — “treason, bribery or other and high crimes and misdemeanours.”</p>
      <h3>TRUMP MAN ROGER STONE GUILTY OF ALL SEVEN CHARGES</h3>

      <p>Roger Stone, a longtime friend and ally of US President Donald Trump, has been found guilty at his trial in federal court in Washington.</p>
      <p>He was charged in a seven-count indictment that alleged he lied to politicians about WikiLeaks, tampered with witnesses and obstructed a House intelligence committee probe.</p>
      <p>His trial highlighted how Trump campaign associates were eager to gather information about emails hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton that were released by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors say Stone lied to Congress about his conversations about WikiLeaks with New York radio host Randy Credico and conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi. He’s also accused of trying to intimidate Credico and threatening to take his dog.</p>
      <p>Stone had denied the allegations and decried the case as politically motivated.</p>
