      <h1>Pick up a Polk Command Bar for $200 ($100 off) and get a new reason to shout at Alexa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:30:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/cody-english/" target="_blank">Cody English</a></address>
      <p>Ever since the introduction of virtual assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant, manufacturers have tried to shoehorn them into every possible product or appliance. Everything from <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/09/20/amazon-expands-alexa-ecosystem-new-smart-home-hardware-microwave-subwoofer-smart-plug/">microwaves</a> to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/25/amazon-echo-show-8-loop-buds-frames-glow/">eyeglasses</a> can now accept voice commands. While these may not be the most practical examples, there is one product category that seems to be a natural fit for voice assistant integration — home theater equipment. Both Polk and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/20/jbl-link-bar-android-tv-soundbar-review/">JBL</a> have attempted to combine the functionality of a soundbar and a smart speaker into one device. Polk's entry into this developing market, the Command Bar, is currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-Hands-free-Multi-Room-Compatible/dp/B078HJMVTK?tag=androidpolice-20">Amazon</a> for $200 — a savings of $100.</p>
      <p>During his time with the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/09/29/polk-command-bar-alexa-review/">Polk Command Bar</a>, AP's very own Jordan Palmer found the sound quality to be a substantial improvement over his current setup. The included wireless subwoofer provided complimentary bass without overpowering the soundbar. Connectivity should be no issue as this device comes with a full complement of ports (2 HDMI, 1 HDMI passthrough, and 1 USB.) The inclusion of Alexa functionality can be helpful, but it can also be triggered accidentally or fail to understand voice commands.</p>

      <p>Although the initial MSRP of $300 may have seemed a bit high, getting both an Echo Dot and a decent soundbar for only $200 could be much harder to pass up. Follow the link below if you could use a little more Alexa, some extra oomph, or a bit of both in your entertainment center.</p>
