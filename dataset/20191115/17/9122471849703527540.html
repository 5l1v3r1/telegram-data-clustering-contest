      <h1>Iowa Makes Special Announcement For Fans Before Minnesota Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:52:28+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Fresh off a close loss to Wisconsin last week, the Iowa Hawkeyes return home to Kinnick Stadium <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/iowa-hawkeyes/iowa-vs-minnesota-espn-bpi-prediction">to take on the 9-0 Minnesota Golden Gophers</a>. Ahead of the game, Iowa has announced that there will be a special theme for the fans in attendance.</p>
      <p>On Friday morning, Iowa announced that Saturday’s game would be a Blackout at Kinnick Stadium. It appears that Iowa will be wearing all-black uniforms, based on the program’s tweet, and the <a href="https://hawkeyesports.com/news/2019/4/23/2019-football-game-themes-announced.aspx">fans are invited to wear black too</a>.</p>

      <p>Saturday’s game will be the 113th edition of the Iowa-Minnesota rivalry. The bronze Floyd of Rosedale trophy will be awarded to the winner.</p>
      <p>Minnesota boasts a 62-48-2 lead in the series, but the Hawkeyes have dominated the Golden Gophers in recent years.</p>
      <p>Iowa is currently riding a four-game winning streak against Minnesota and are 14-4 against them since 2001.</p>
      <p>And even though they play every year, Minnesota has not beaten Iowa at Kinnick Stadium since 1989.</p>
      <p>Fans and bettors alike are certainly bracing for the No. 20 ranked Hawkeyes to upset the unbeaten No. 8 Golden Gophers.</p>
      <p>We’ll have to see if the Blackout theme proves to be a good luck charm for the Hawkeyes.</p>
      <p>The game will be played at 4:00 p.m. EST and will air on FOX.</p>
