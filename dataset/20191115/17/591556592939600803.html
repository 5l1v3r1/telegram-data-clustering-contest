      <p>Consumer experience company Episerver recently released its <a href="https://www.episerver.com/learn/guides/report-survey-reveals-2019-holiday-online-shopping-trends/">2019 holiday shopping trends report</a>. It surveyed 4,500 global online shoppers to discover any differences in the way that customers shop and the way that retailers want them to behave. <br/><br/>According to Episerver data, traffic from social to e-commerce websites doubled in the first half of 2019 -- compared to 2017 and 2018. The survey found that Amazon has almost reached the tipping point for shoppers. Over two out of five (42%) of shoppers are planning to buy all or most of their gifts this year from Amazon.<br/><br/>One in three (32%) of online shoppers start their holiday shopping on Amazon, followed by Google (18%) and a retailer's website (17%). When it comes to apparel shopping, more consumers turn to a brand/retailer's website (43%) than Google (29%) or Amazon (30%).<br/><br/>Shoppers want to buy online. Thirty-nine percent of holiday shoppers prefer to do most of their shopping online -- compared to 36% who do the majority of their shopping in-store. Over two out of three (68%) of online shoppers often or always compare what they find on a brand or website to what's available on Amazon.</p>

      <p>Only 12% of shoppers indicating they start their holiday shopping year-round. <br/><br/>For the majority of shoppers, November starts the uptick in shopping, with 13% starting at the start of the month, and 17% shopping at the end of November.</p>
      <p>Ed Kennedy, senior director of commerce at Episerver, said: "Despite priding itself on customer-obsession, Amazon still lacks in areas like product education, inspirational content and fanatical customer service." <br/><br/>However, all is not lost for brands. Amazon still lacks in areas including product education, inspirational content, how-to guides, and customer service. <br/><br/>This opens a window of opportunity for brands to fill the gap with tactics Amazon won't use during the holiday shopping season. Almost half (47%) of online shoppers will buy few or none of their gifts via Amazon.Â  <br/><br/>Consumers expect superb experience from brands who are expected to come up with the Amazon model of online sales. <br/><br/>Brands need to make sure that their experience is filled with human experiences, how-to guides, great customer service, and relevant email messaging. <br/><br/>Brands will then be able to retain their edge as shopping by Amazon continues its inexorable rise.</p>
