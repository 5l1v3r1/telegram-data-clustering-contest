        <li>On October 22, Under Armour announced that Plank would be stepping down from his role as CEO and will be replaced by COO Patrik Frisk on January 1. Plank will become the executive chairman and brand chief.</li>
        <li>On November 4, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armour-is-subject-of-federal-accounting-probe-11572819835">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Under Armour is under federal investigation to determine whether the brand altered its recorded revenue to bolster its healthy appearance.

      <p>On <a href="https://about.underarmour.com/investor-relations/news-events-presentations/corporate-news/id/20981">October 22</a>, Under Armour announced that founder <a href="http://businessinsider.com/category/kevin-plank">Kevin Plank</a> would be stepping down from his role as CEO. Effective January 1, he will be replaced by Patrik Frisk, the company’s current president and chief operating officer.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, Plank will become the executive chairman and brand chief at Under Armour, a company he founded in his grandmother’s Washington D.C. basement in 1996.</p>
      <p>Two weeks after the announcement of Plank’s departure from his role, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armour-is-subject-of-federal-accounting-probe-11572819835">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported that federal authorities are investigating Under Armour’s accounting practices. According to the Journal’s November 4 report, the company has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armour-is-subject-of-federal-accounting-probe-11572819835">under Justice Department and SEC investigations since 2017</a> for its revenue disclosure practices.</p>
      <p>“The company firmly believes that its accounting practices and disclosures were appropriate,” a representative for Under Armour told the Journal. Under Armour is reportedly cooperating with the investigations.</p>
      <p>In a November 14 report, the Journal alleged that Under Armour purposefully <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-under-armours-sales-scramble-pulling-forward-every-quarter-11573777489">“pushed early shipments” and “dumped goods”</a> at off-price stores such as TJ Maxx to bolster sales growth. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/under-armour-founder-kevin-plank-responds-explosive-wsj-report-2019-11">Business Insider obtained an email Plank wrote to employees on Friday.</a> “Given recent events that have entered the realm of public opinion without full context, it is disappointing to have our integrity and reputation called into question,” Plank wrote.</p>
      <p>“With respect to inquiries into Under Armour’s business practices by the Securities and Exchange commission and the Department of Justice, we firmly believe that our disclosures and our accounting practices have been entirely appropriate,” he reiterated. “We respect the government’s process and will continue to cooperate with thoughtful and proper resolve.”</p>

      <p>Plank, the youngest of five brothers, was kicked out of Georgetown Prep, a private Jesuit high school outside Washington D.C., for being involved in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-plank-got-kicked-out-of-high-school-and-went-on-to-run-under-armour-2015-10">“an alcohol-fueled brawl”</a> during his sophomore year.</p>
      <p>He then attended <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/under-armour-founder-gives-16-million-to-st-johns-college-high/2015/11/06/7adc7724-84bf-11e5-9afb-0c971f713d0c_story.html">St. John’s College High</a>, another Catholic prep school in the area, where he played football. He graduated at 17, and instead of going directly to college, he went to <a href="https://www.si.com/more-sports/2009/04/09/under-armour">a military academy known for producing top football talent</a> for one year.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/under-armour-ceo-praises-trump-2017-2">In an interview with CNBC,</a> Plank said: “To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country.”</p>
      <p>The comment caused waves and Under Armour ultimately issued a statement saying: “We engage in policy, not politics.”</p>
      <p>On other topics, however, Plank publicly disagreed with Trump. When the president referred to Baltimore as a “rodent infested mess,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/business/kevin-plank-donald-trump-trnd/index.html">Plank took to Instagram to defend Under Armour’s homebase.</a></p>

Ruhle and Plank had traveled together on his private jet and she had given him input on business matters, The Journal reported, citing executives and people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>Plank and Ruhle alike declined to comment for the Journal’s article. “Mr. Plank and Ms. Ruhle are friends,” Under Armour’s senior vice president of communications, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-under-armour-ceos-unusual-adviser-an-msnbc-anchor-11550763306">told The Wall Street Journal at the time.</a></p>

      <p>On November 4, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armour-is-subject-of-federal-accounting-probe-11572819835">the Wall Street Journal</a>‘s Aruna Viswanatha and Khadeeja Safdar reported that the Justice Department and the SEC are investigating Under Armour for its accounting and revenue disclosure practices. The main question is whether the company altered recorded revenue from quarter to quarter to maintain a healthy appearance. The company told The Journal it is cooperating with the investigation.</p>
      <p>The company began responding to requests for accounting-related documents in July 2017. A company representative told the Journal: “The company firmly believes that its accounting practices and disclosures were appropriate.”</p>
      <p>On Thursday November 14, the Journal released a report alleging that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-under-armours-sales-scramble-pulling-forward-every-quarter-11573777489">Under Armour “dumped goods” at off-price chains like TJ Maxx to boost sales growth</a>. The report led Plank to send a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/under-armour-founder-kevin-plank-responds-explosive-wsj-report-2019-11">company-wide email</a> in response.</p>
      <p>“Given recent events that have entered the realm of public opinion without full context, it is disappointing to have our integrity and reputation called into question,” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/under-armour-founder-kevin-plank-responds-explosive-wsj-report-2019-11">Plank wrote in the Friday email obtained by Business Insider.</a></p>
