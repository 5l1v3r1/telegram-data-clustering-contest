      <p>Cape Town - Heavy rain in KwaZulu-Natal over the past week meant that the <b>Mzansi Super League (MSL)</b> clash between the <b>Durban Heat </b>and <b>Paarl Rocks</b> had to be abandoned well before the scheduled start at Kingsmead on Friday.</p>
      <p>Storm warnings had been issued in the city on Wednesday and Thursday, with persistent rain falling throughout and including during the build-up to the clash.</p>
      <p>The seasonal rain also claimed victory in the Heatâ€™s opening game against Tshwane Spartans last Saturday as the outfield at the venue could not continue absorbing the high volume of water that continued to pour down.</p>
      <p>It left the officials with little choice but to abandon play an hour before the scheduled start.</p>
      <p>The result means the Durban franchise now have four points from their two wash-outs, level on points with the Spartans, whose first two matches were also no results.</p>
      <p>The Rocks, meanwhile, moved up to six points and in second place behind Cape Town Blitz.</p>
      <p>The Heat next face the Blitz in the early game in Durban on Sunday, while Paarl are at home to the Spartans later on the same day.</p>
