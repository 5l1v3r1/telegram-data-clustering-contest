      <h1>Long-running dispute ends as Nottingham College rules out staff pay cuts</h1>
      <h2>Union members had been due to walk out for 14 days this month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:02:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>A long-running dispute between union officials and Nottingham College has come to an end after a deal was struck ruling out staff pay cuts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">Union officials</a> have said the college has agreed to retain current workload protections. bringing an end to months of uncertainty.</p>
      <p>They said cuts to sick pay had been ruled out and staff annual leave would remain at current levels for two years.</p>
      <p>Strike action planned this month has been cancelled.</p>
      <p>Andrew Harden, head of further education for the University and College Union (UCU), said: "Nobody ever wants to take strike action, but this deal is a testament to members’ determination to fight threats to their pay and working conditions.</p>
      <p>"We should never have got to this stage and questions remain about why students lost 15 days of lessons at such a crucial time of year.</p>
      <p>"The college has finally recognised that it needs to work with its staff and not against them and we hope this deal will now pave the way for more positive future negotiations on pay and conditions at the college."</p>
      <p>The dispute centred on the college's attempts to impose what the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">union</a> described as "inferior contracts", which it said could have cut holiday entitlement and left some staff more than £1,000 worse off.</p>

      <p>UCU members at the college walked out for 15 days in September and October and passed votes of no confidence in their chief executive and chairman of governors.</p>
      <p>Union members had been <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/nottingham-college-strike-suspended-eleventh-3501733">due to walk out for 14 days this month</a> but agreed to suspend the action to consider the college's latest offer, which has now been accepted.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Nottingham College added: “The college is pleased to confirm that the dispute with UCU has been resolved and further strike action has been called off.</p>
      <p>"We now have the opportunity to put the industrial action behind us, learn from the experience and work together, as one college, to deliver the excellent teaching and learning and create the outstanding college experience that our students deserve.”</p>
