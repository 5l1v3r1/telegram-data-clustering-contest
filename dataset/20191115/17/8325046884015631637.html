      <p>This card also comes with valuable cell phone protection for damage or theft worth up to $600 as long as you use the card to pay for your monthly bill.

      <h3>11. Discover it® Cash Back</h3>
      <p><b>Why use it for rideshares:</b> The good news is, this card earns a whopping 5% cash back on Uber and Lyft rides. The bad news is, it is only for three months a year and is capped at $1,500 in spending.</p>

In 2019, the April – June merchants were gas stations, Uber and Lyft.</p>
      <p>We don’t yet know the 2020 calendar, but chances are these services will make a reappearance next spring. Other quarterly bonus categories have included grocery stores, restaurants, Amazon.com, Target.com and Walmart.com.</p>
      <h3>Plus, don’t forget the World and World Elite Mastercards</h3>
      <p>Don’t forget that Mastercard added new benefits for those with World Mastercard and World Elite Mastercard products like the Barclaycard AAdvantage Aviator Red, the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard, the Citi Premier and the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/ihg-rewards-club-premier-credit-card/?utm_campaign=bi_best-cards-rideshares-111519&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card</a>. They include a $10 credit for every five Lyft rides taken in a calendar year that is then applied to their next ride.</p>

But still more field broader travel bonus categories that include services like Lyft and Uber.
