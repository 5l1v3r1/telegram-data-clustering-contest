      <p>Manchester United are weighing up a move in January for Jadon Sancho, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær alerted by the forward’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/25/jadon-sancho-borussia-dortmund">recent troubles at Borussia Dortmund</a>.</p>
      <p>The manager has identified Sancho as a summer target but he and Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, have a policy of trying to sign players of interest in the preceding winter window should there be a chance of doing so.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was last month dropped and fined by Dortmund for being late back to training after England duty. Last Saturday he was taken off after 36 minutes of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund-bundesliga-match-report">4-0 defeat by Bayern Munich</a>, then criticised by his manager, Lucien Favre, who confirmed Sancho had not been injured.</p>
      <p>Sancho started <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/14/england-montenegro-euro-2020-qualifer-match-report">England’s 7-0 win over Montenegro</a> on Thursday. If United firm up their interest in January they may face competition from clubs including Liverpool and Real Madrid.</p>
