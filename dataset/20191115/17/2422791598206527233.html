      <h1>Michael Buble becomes latest Canadian star to get waxed at Madame Tussauds</h1>

      <p>TORONTO -- Michael Buble's suave likeness is headed for the halls of wax infamy alongside British royalty.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/MadameTussauds/status/1194889917601583105">The Canadian pop crooner took to social media</a> to announce he's being replicated at Madame Tussauds wax museum in London.</p>
      <p>He'll be in good company at the tourist hotspot, which already houses wax versions of Ed Sheeran, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt and members of the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>Buble's duplicate makes its debut in December -- timing that couldn't be any better for the singer who's become synonymous with the holiday season.</p>
      <p>But what he'll look like remains a mystery. A representative for the museum says they're keeping the figure under wraps for now.</p>
      <p>In the video announcement, Buble revealed the news while his one-year-old daughter could be heard crying in the background.</p>
      <p>"You can probably hear my kid screaming," he said with a laugh.</p>
      <p>"This is one of those points where I wish there could be two of me, and luckily there is."</p>
      <p>Buble joins a number of other Canadian musicians who've been recreated at Tussauds this year.</p>
      <p>Madame Tussauds Las Vegas introduced a wax version of Drake posing in a recreation of his "Hotline Bling" music video.</p>
      <p>Shawn Mendes was added to the Berlin location lying barefoot on the ground so visitors could snuggle beside him for a photograph.</p>
