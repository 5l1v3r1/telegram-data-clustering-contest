      <p>A judge ruled that a US-born Isis bride condemned by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> is not a US citizen and should be barred from reentering the US.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Reggie Watson, a Federal District Court Judge for the District of Columbia dismissed a lawsuit brought in February by Hoda Muthana’s family, who hoped to retrieve Muthana and her 2-year-old son from a refugee camp in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/syria/">Syria</a>.</p>
      <p>Muthana, 25, was born in New Jersey to a diplomat from Yemen, but ran away to join <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/islamic-state-isis/">ISIS</a> in 2014 after apparently becoming radicalized online. She married three different ISIS fighters while overseas before she was captured by Kurdish forces in January.</p>

      <p>Watson said Muthana’s father, Ahmed Ali Muthana, cannot provide financial support to Muthana or her son without facing possible charges of providing material support to terrorism.</p>
      <p>In February, President Donald Trump tweeted: ‘I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!’</p>

      <p>While Muthana was overseas, the US government determined that she was not a US citizen and revoked her passport because her father was a diplomat at the time of her birth.</p>
      <p>The Department of Justice said that because Muthana’s father was a former Yemeni diplomat at the time of her birth, he was under the diplomatic protection of his home country. Because of this, Muthana did not obtain a US citizenship by birth on US soil, the department said.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Muthana’s family said they would be appealing the ruling.</p>
      <p>Christina Jump, a lawyer with the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, said: ‘While we are disappointed with and disagree with the Court’s ruling today, this is not the end of our client’s legal options.’</p>
