      <h1>First Nations ‘optimistic’ about road upgrades after Horgan visits site of fatal bus crash</h1>
      <h2>Premier travelled Bamfield Main road, where bus flipped last September and two students were killed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:07:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/avn-staff/" target="_blank">Alberni News Staff</a></address>
      <p>A group of First Nations on Vancouver Island say they are “optimistic” that Premier John Horgan’s recent visit will lead to significant upgrades to the main road, following a fatal bus crash in September.</p>
      <p>Horgan travelled the Bamfield Main road to the Huu-ay-aht First Nations’ main village, down the coast from Ucluelet, on Thursday and met with members of the City of Alberni, regional district, transportation ministry, and others to discuss improvements.</p>
      <p>Concerns resurfaced after a bus carrying students from the University of Victoria <a href="https://www.albernivalleynews.com/news/breaking-two-killed-after-bus-crashed-taking-university-students-to-bamfield/">flipped over</a> on its way to the Marine Sciences Centre at Bamfield. Two students, and 18-year-old woman from Winnipeg and an 18-year-old man from the United States, were killed.</p>
      <p>Huu-ay-aht has been campaigning for decades to resurface the road with a mixture of asphalt, water and gravel to extend its life and protect it from moisture.</p>
      <p>Horgan directed ministry staff to form a group with Huu-ay-aht and other stakeholders to create a plan to upgrade the road.</p>
      <p>“We have met in a respectful way, and it is clear we are all committed,” Huu-ay-aht chief councillor Robert Dennis Sr. in a news release. He called the road the “vital link” connecting his village and the science centre to the rest of the island.</p>

      <p>Since it opened in the 1970s, Huu-ay-aht has lost eight people along the 78-kilometre logging road.</p>
