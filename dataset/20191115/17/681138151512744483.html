        <b>A sculpture of 40,000 tiny terracotta figures by Sir Antony Gormley is on display in Colchester - with the Angel Of The North sculptor calling it a "call to conscience".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Field For The British Isles was made in 1993 from around 50 tonnes of brick clay by more than 100 volunteers at a secondary school.</p>
      <p>It is now back on show at Firstsite in Colchester after 30 people spent four days putting each of the tiny figures in place.</p>
      <p>The display, which was installed by Gurkhas, students and members of a Bangladeshi women's organisation, will now be on show at the Firstsite for four months, until March 8, 2020.</p>
      <p>Asked whether some of the tiny clay individuals had been stolen in the past, Sir Antony said: "I think some of these go walkabout, but that's understandable.</p>
      <p>"There is not one that is like another."</p>
      <p>The Turner Prize winner said it was impossible to pick a favourite, adding: "How can you? It's a bit like asking a parent who their favourite child is."</p>
      <p>He said the figures "are looking at us and asking us: 'What kind of world are you making? What are we doing?'"</p>
      <p>The initial volunteers who made the sculpture were given just one simple instruction - "hand-sized, stand up and have eyes".</p>
      <p>Firstsite director Sally Shaw said: "I think this is probably the most important artwork we could be showing in the UK.</p>
      <p>"It's about community and being together and also about thousands and thousands of individual people."</p>
      <p>She joked about visitors getting close up to the fragile piece, saying: "I am more worried about adults coming in.</p>
      <p>"Children are very excited about it. They stop and lie down on the floor to be on a level with it...</p>
      <p>"What I love about it is there are 40,000 figures and 40,000 children and young people living in Colchester. It's an opportunity to visualise that community. It's very powerful.</p>
      <p>"I'd invite everyone to come. It might be another 20 years before we show it again. This is the kind of artwork this gallery was made for."</p>
      <p>The exhibition is the largest single artwork in the Arts Council collection and will be uniquely arranged for a one-of-a-kind display in Colchester.</p>
