      <p>In Thursday's 7-0 win against Montenegro England secured its place in the Euro 2020 tournament, but the qualifiers are not yet over: this Sunday it once again takes on Kosovo. In this article, we explain how to watch the England vs Kosovo live stream.</p>
      <h3>What is Euro 2020?</h3>
      <p>Euro 2020, otherwise known as the UEFA European Football Championship, is the 16th instalment of the men's football tournament that has since 1960 taken place every four years.</p>
      <p>All 55 UEFA member states get a chance to qualify for in the event, but only 24 teams make it through to the final tournament. </p>
      <p>Though Euro 2020 doesn’t officially begin until 12 June next year, we’re already seeing some football action with the qualifying stages, which conclude this November.</p>
      <p>Portugal are the defending champs from Euro 2016, but neither they or any of the countries in which matches are held will gain automatic entry to the tournament.</p>
      <p>Previous winners have included Spain (1964, 2008, 2012), Greece (2004), France (1984, 2000), Denmark (1992), Netherlands (1988), Germany (1972, 1980, 1996), the then Czechoslovakia (1976), Italy (1968) and the Soviet Union (1960), but never England. We came third back in 1968, and joint-third in 1996, so it's time for England to bring it home.</p>
      <h3>When is Euro 2020?</h3>
      <p>The main tournament begins on <b>12 June 2020</b>, with the final on <b>12 July 2020</b>, though the qualifiers have taking place since March 2019 and conclude this month. Play-offs to determine the final few spots will take place in March 2020.</p>
      <h3>Where is Euro 2020 hosted?</h3>
      <p>This year there is no single destination for the tournament, with matches spread over 12 European cities in 12 countries. UEFA President Michael Platini notes that this is to mark the 60th birthday of the tournament.</p>
      <p>It is at London’s Wembley Stadium that the most important matches will be held, however, with the UK hosting both the semi-finals and final. Previously home to Euro 1996, this will be the second time Wembley has had the pleasure.</p>
      <p>Other Euro 2020 hosts include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Olympic Stadium, Baku, Azerbaijan</li>
        <li>Allianz Arena, Munich, Germany</li>
        <li>Stadio Olimpico, Rome, Italy</li>
        <li>Krestovsky Stadium, St Petersburg, Russia</li>
        <li>Parekn Stadium, Copenhagen, Denmark</li>
        <li>Pauskas Arena, Budapest, Hungary</li>
        <li>Johan Cruyff Arena, Amsterdam, Netherlands</li>
        <li>Aviva Stadium, Dublin, Republic of Ireland</li>
        <li>Arena Nationala, Bucharest, Romania</li>
        <li>Hampden Park, Glasgow, Scotland</li>
        <li>San Mames, Bilbao, Spain</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Which football teams will compete in Euro 2020?</h3>
      <p>All 55 European teams are split into 10 groups, as outlined below. Following a series of matches against others in their group only the top two teams in each will be put through to the final tournament.</p>
      <p><b>Group A:</b> England, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Kosovo</p>
      <p><b>Group B:</b> Portugal, Ukraine, Serbia, Lithuania, Luxembourg</p>
      <p><b>Group C:</b> Netherlands, Germany, Northern Ireland, Estonia, Belarus</p>
      <p><b>Group D:</b> Switzerland, Denmark, Republic of Ireland, Georgia, Gibraltar</p>
      <p><b>Group E:</b> Croatia, Wales, Slovakia, Hungary, Azerbaijan</p>
      <p><b>Group F:</b> Spain, Sweden, Norway, Romania, Faroe Islands, Malta</p>
      <p><b>Group G:</b> Poland, Austria, Israel, Slovenia, Macedonia, Latvia</p>
      <p><b>Group H:</b> France, Iceland, Turkey, Albania, Moldova, Andorra</p>
      <p><b>Group I:</b> Belgium, Russia, Scotland, Cyprus, Kazakhstan, San Marino</p>
      <p><b>Group J:</b> Italy, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Finland, Greece, Armenia, Liechtenstein</p>
      <p>However, this is only half the story, and some of you might have already spotted that 10 multiplied by two is actually 20, not 24. So where do the extra four come from?</p>
      <p>To understand this we need to look back to the 2018-2019 UEFA Nations League. There were 16 group winners in this tournament, all of whom are guaranteed a place in the Euro 2020 play-offs, which take place following the qualifying stage in March 2020.</p>
      <p>Chances are those teams will have already secured a place in the Euro 2020 tournament, of course, and in which case their play-off position is passed down to the next best team in their tier. One successful team in each group then goes through to the Euro 2020 tournament.</p>
      <h4>UEFA Nations League 2018-2019 group winners</h4>
      <p><b>League A:</b> Portugal, England, Switzerland, Netherlands</p>
      <p><b>League B:</b> Ukraine, Denmark, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sweden</p>
      <p><b>League C:</b> Finland, Norway, Scotland, Serbia</p>
      <p><b>League D:</b> Georgia, Belarus, Macedonia, Kosovo</p>
      <h3>Is England guaranteed a place in Euro 2020?</h3>
      <p>Yes. When we first wrote this article the answer was no, but as of its 14 November match against Montenegro it has now won enough points to secure its place in the tournament.</p>
      <h3>When is England playing next in Euro 2020?</h3>
      <p>England will compete against Kosovo in the qualifying stages on <b>Sunday 17 December 2019</b> at <b>5pm UK time</b>. This is the final England match in the qualifying stages.</p>
      <h3>How to watch England vs Kosovo in the UK: What TV channel?</h3>
      <p>If you’re in the UK this is really easy: you can watch the Euro 2020 qualifier on <b>ITV</b>, with coverage airing on 17 November between <b>4.15pm</b> and <b>7.15pm</b>.</p>
      <p>ITV is available on your TV, online at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701958-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Feuro-2020-england-3701958%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itv.com%2Fhub%2Fitv">itv.com/hub/itv</a>, or via the ITV Hub mobile apps for iOS and Android. You’ll also be able to watch ITV live using any Freeview app.</p>
      <p>To watch live you will need a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/digital-home/tv-licence-3423808/">TV Licence</a>, of course, and are exempt only if you tune in via catch-up after the broadcast has finished.</p>
      <h3>How to watch England vs Kosovo from abroad</h3>
      <p>It is possible to <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-itv-hub-abroad-3684901/">watch ITV Hub from abroad</a> though you will need to either sign up for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701958-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Feuro-2020-england-3701958%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itv.com%2Fhub%2Fplus">ITV Hub+</a> (£3.99/month with a seven-day free trial) or use a VPN. The latter might be necessary if you’re outside Europe.</p>
      <p>A VPN (or virtual private network) is software that lets you mask your IP address in order to appear as if you are somewhere you are not. So, you could be in Spain and pretend to be browsing from the UK, then access ITV Hub or Freeview services as normal.</p>
      <p>We’ve reviewed a bunch of <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/internet/best-vpn-reviews-3657732/">VPNs</a> but our current top pick is <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=350&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=2154&amp;aff_sub=06-3701958-11-0000000">NordVPN</a>. Because streaming services are wise to the use of VPNs you might need to try a few different servers before you find one that works.</p>
