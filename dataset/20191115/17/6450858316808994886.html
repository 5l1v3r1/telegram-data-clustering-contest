      <p>Black Friday deals have started to arrive and NordVPN isn't sitting this dance out. Whether you're after privacy or streaming content not available in your country, a VPN or Virtual Private Network seems to be a standard part of web-browsing these days.</p>
      <p><a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=350&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=2154&amp;aff_sub=06-3700319-11-0000000">Nord VPN </a>leads the market, and for good reason. It's user friendly, has an extensive list of features, and now it's super cheap, with a <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=350&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=2154&amp;aff_sub=06-3700319-11-0000000">70% off the 3-year plan</a>. The VPN company is also throwing in an additional 3 months for free.</p>
      <p>The discount sheds nearly £247 the regular three-year price (£348.46), bringing the total to £101.76 at £2.82 per month. <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=350&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=2154&amp;aff_sub=06-3700319-11-0000000">Head to NordVPN now to see this deal</a>, which is refundable for 30 days.</p>
      <p>Nord sits at the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/internet/best-vpn-reviews-3657732/">top of our chart of the best VPNs around</a> and there are a few reasons that make it our favourite. It's fast, easy to use, offers 5,687 servers across 60 countries, and works with Netflix, HBO GO, ShowTime, Hulu and a bunch of other streaming services. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-disney-plus-uk-3777628/">Here's how to watch Disney+ in the UK</a> using a  VPN. Also see our article on <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-bbc-iplayer-abroad-3512135/">how to watch BBC iPlayer abroad</a>.</p>
      <p>Nord also uses 256-bit encryption and operates from Panama – and therefore outside the '14-eyes' jurisdiction for extra privacy. The 14-eyes jurisdiction is a group of countries that agree to share user information freely with one another.</p>
      <p>The other benefit Nord offers is its kill switch feature, which automatically ends your internet activity if the VPN disconnects. You can fine-tune which apps it should terminate, so you don't have to disconnect everything all at once. See our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/vpn/nordvpn-3606150/">full review of NordVPN</a> for everything there is to know about the service.</p>
