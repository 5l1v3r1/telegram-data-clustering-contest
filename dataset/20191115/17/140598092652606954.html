      <h1>Trump's former adviser Roger Stone found guilty of obstruction of justice and lying to Congress</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:03:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/rozina-sabur/" target="_blank">Rozina Sabur</a></address>
      <p>Donald Trump's former adviser Roger Stone was found guilty on Friday of lying to Congress over his contact with the website Wikileaks.</p>
      <p>Stone, a longtime Republican political operative who worked on the US president's 2016 campaign, was found guilty by a jury of all seven charges in the case which included lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstruction.</p>
      <p>The charges against him related to his contacts with Wikileaks, whose publication of Russian-hacked emails from Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign gave a boost to Mr Trump.</p>
      <p>Stone, 67, is the sixth campaign associate of Mr Trump to be convicted as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the president's campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>He has consistently denied the allegations and decried the case as politically motivated. </p>

      <p>He is likely to face a lengthy prison term when sentenced on February 6, but many Republican defenders have already begun clamouring for Mr Trump to offer a presidential pardon.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump hit out at the verdict on Twitter, saying: "So they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come". The president went on to ask why it was not his adversaries, including Mrs Clinton and "even Mueller himself? Didn't they lie?"</p>
      <p>"A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?" Mr Trump added.  </p>

      <p>Witness tampering, the most serious charge against Stone, carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with the other charges carrying a maximum of five years each. But as a first-time, non-violent offender his sentence is likely to be much lighter.</p>
      <p>A self-described "dirty trickster," Stone began his political career as a campaign aide to Richard Nixon, and has a large tattoo of the former president on his back.</p>
      <p>He has been friendly with Mr Trump for several decades and was one of the first members of his campaign team. </p>
      <p>During the trial, prosecutors accused him of lying and witness tampering in a Congressional investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election. </p>
      <p>They argued that Stone told five lies under oath to lawmakers, including about his outreach to WikiLeaks and his conversations with Trump campaign officials, to shield the president from embarrassment.   </p>
      <p>Some of those lies related to the existence of texts or emails, while others pertained to Stone's conversations with Trump campaign officials and a supposed "intermediary" with WikiLeaks in August 2016 whom Stone identified to lawmakers as being comedian Randy Credico.</p>
      <p>At that time, prosecutors said, Stone was actually dispatching a conservative author named Jerome Corsi to, as one email stated, "get to Assange!"</p>

      <p>Stone was also accused of tampering with a witness, Mr Credico, when he was summoned to testify before Congress and speak with the FBI.</p>
      <p>In emails and texts, Stone told Mr Credico among other things: "Prepare to die," "You're a rat. A stoolie," and "Stonewall it." He even threatened Mr Credico's therapy dog, Bianca, saying he was "going to take that dog away from you", the trial heard.</p>
      <p>The colourful trial featured references to the film "The Godfather Part II" and testimony by political heavyweights including Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former campaign CEO and White House chief strategist, and former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates. Those witnesses said they believed Stone had inside information about when WikiLeaks might release more damaging emails about Mrs Clinton.</p>
      <p>The verdict in the trial, which shone a fresh layer of scrutiny on Mr Trump's actions as a candidate, comes as the president is in the throes of an impeachment inquiry that also involves claims of foreign involvement in a US election.</p>
      <p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, said Stone's conviction "sends a powerful and timely message to President Trump and all House and Senate witnesses - past, present, and future - that lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstruction of Congress are crimes and those who commit crimes do so at their own peril."</p>
      <p>Before the verdict was announced, Stone, who remains under a court-imposed gag order, arrived at the courthouse clad in a pinstripe suit, blue tie with white dots, white handkerchief in his pocket, arm in arm with his wife, sunglasses in one hand, a small red copy of the Bible in the other and a smile on his face.</p>
      <p>The jury of nine women and three women took seven hours over two days to reach their verdict. Stone showed no outward signs of emotion as he was pronounced guilty. </p>
      <p>The prosecution had asked district judge Amy Berman Jackson to detain Stone until his sentencing.</p>
      <p>They argued that the night before, radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed Stone had sent him a message. On the show, Jones said he was passing along a pardon request to Trump from Stone. Judge Jackson rejected the request.</p>
