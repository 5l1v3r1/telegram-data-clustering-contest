      <p>Bath will attempt to put their indifferent domestic form to one side when they face Ulster at the Rec, while there is another Premiership-PRO14 contest at Scotstoun as Glasgow take on Sale.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Benetton face a tough opener on their return to the Champions Cup with a trip to four-time winners Leinster, Munster take on an Ospreys side in freefall, while two Premiership sides face difficult trips to France.</p>
      <h4>Bath vs Ulster, Recreation Ground (1pm)</h4>

        <img src="https://e1.365dm.com/19/11/768x432/skysports-rugby-billy-burns_4837493.jpg?20191115163559"/>
        <figcaption>Billy Burns faces brother Freddie and former side Bath</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Bath welcome back England trio Jonathan Joseph, Ruaridh McConnochie and Sam Underhill while Freddie Burns continues at full-back.</p>
      <p>Burns' brother Billy comes in at fly-half for Ulster, who are captained by Ireland forward Iain Henderson on his return to club action.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Key match-up: Jamie Roberts vs Stuart McCloskey</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://e1.365dm.com/19/11/768x432/skysports-rugby-jamie-roberts_4837496.jpg?20191115163922"/>
        <figcaption>Jamie Roberts will make his presence felt in midfield</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Both teams will look to their powerful inside centres to get them over the gainline. Roberts is a crash-ball expert and will punch holes in opposition defences, while McCloskey is another big carrier who is capable of offloading in contact.</p>
      <p>Also keep on eye on the battle of the Burns as Freddie attempts to deny Billy a winning return to his hometown club.</p>
      <h3>Match fact</h3>
      <p>Ulster have won all four of their Champions Cup matches against Bath. The last of those was a 26-22 win at the Rec in 2010.</p>

        <figcaption>Daniel Du Preez starts at No 8 for Sale</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>USA fly-half AJ MacGinty makes his first Sale start since returning from the World Cup while European rugby's all-time top try scorer Chris Ashton has been named on the bench.</p>
      <p>Glasgow have named Nick Grigg alongside Scotland team-mate Sam Johnson in midfield, with Rob Harley restored to the second row after being rested for last weekend's win at Zebre.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Key match-up: Ratu Tagive vs Byron McGuigan</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://e2.365dm.com/19/11/768x432/skysports-rugby-ratu-tagive_4837498.jpg?20191115164411"/>
        <figcaption>Ratu Tagive has scored tries in successive games</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>McGuigan returns to Scotstoun with a point to prove after missing out on Scotland selection for the World Cup.</p>
      <p>But the 30-year-old will be tested in defence by rugby league convert Tagive, who is seeking his third try in as many matches.</p>
      <h3>Match fact</h3>

        <figcaption>Champions Cup debutant Ronan Kelleher scored two tries against Connacht last weekend</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Ireland internationals Johnny Sexton, Jordan Larmour, Garry Ringrose, James Ryan and Josh van der Flier all make their first appearances of the season with former Ireland U20 captain Caelan Doris handed his first European start from No 8.</p>
      <p>Former Ireland international Ian Keatley is preferred to Tommaso Allan at fly-half for Benetton.</p>
      <p><b>Key match-up:</b> <b>Johnny Sexton vs Ian Keatley</b></p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://e2.365dm.com/19/10/768x432/skysports-jonny-sextion-ireland_4809322.jpg?20191019104507"/>
        <figcaption>Johnny Sexton returns to captain Leinster</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>All eyes will be on Leinster's skipper as he returns to club action following further World Cup disappointment with Ireland.</p>
      <p>He comes up against his former international team-mate Keatley, whose kicking will be crucial if Benetton are to stand any chance of causing an upset.</p>
      <h3>Match fact</h3>
      <p>Benetton have lost all 14 matches against Irish opposition in the Champions Cup.</p>
      <p><b>Leinster:</b> 15 Jordan Larmour, 14 Dave Kearney, 13 Garry Ringrose, 12 Joe Tomane, 11 James Lowe, 10 Johhny Sexton (c), 9 Luke McGrath; 1 Cian Healy, 2 Ronan Kelleher, 3 Andrew Porter, 4 Devin Toner, 5 James Ryan, 6 Rhys Ruddock, 7 Josh van der Flier, 8 Caelan Doris.</p>

        <figcaption>Ireland legend Ronan O'Gara is head coach at La Rochelle</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Dave Dennis and Dave Ewers come into the Exeter pack following last weekend's home defeat to Bristol while England internationals Ben Moon, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Don Armand and Jack Nowell are all named on the bench.</p>
      <p>La Rochelle have selected international duo Levani Botia and Geoffrey Doumayrou in midfield with Alexi Bales partnering Ihaia West at half-back.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Key match-up: Jeremy Sinzelle vs Stuart Hogg</b>

        <figcaption>Can Stuart Hogg help improve Exeter's poor European record?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Hogg was signed for his big-match experience as Exeter look to put their European struggles behind him.</p>
      <p>With rain promised for this Pool 2 clash, Hogg's tactical kicking could prove crucial as will his ability in the air against the versatile Sinzelle.</p>
      <h3>Match fact</h3>
      <p>Exeter beat more defenders (33) than any other side in last season's Champions Cup.</p>
      <p><b>La Rochelle:</b> 15 Jeremy Sinzelle, 14 Vincent Rattez, 13 Geoffrey Doumayrou, 12 Levani Botia, 11 Arthur Retiere, 10 Ihaia West, 9 Alexi Bales; 1 Dany Priso, 2 Pierre Bourgarit, 3 Arthur Joly, 4 Romain Sazy, 5 Mathieu Tanguy, 6 Gregory Alldritt, 7 Wiaan Liebenberg, 8 Victor Vito (c).</p>

      <p>Scott Otten starts at hooker while Tom Williams comes in on the left wing as the Ospreys look to put last weekend's shock loss to the Southern Kings behind them.</p>
      <p>Keith Earls and Conor Murray make their first starts of the season, with Tyler Bleyendaal partnering Murray at half-back. JJ Hanrahan and Dave Kilcoyne miss out due to injury.</p>

        <figcaption>Peter O'Mahony stole two lineouts against Ulster</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Lydiate has been one of the top tacklers in the PRO14 this season and another big shift in defence will be required here.</p>
      <p>Opposing skipper O'Mahony impressed on his Munster return against Ulster last weekend, making two lineout steals in all-action 80-minute display.</p>
      <h3>Match fact</h3>
      <p>Munster have won 16 of their last 18 Champions Cup games against Welsh opposition but were beaten by the Ospreys when they last met in this competition in 2010.</p>
      <p><b>Ospreys: </b>15 Cai Evans, 14 Hanno Dirksen, 13 Tiaan Thomas-Wheeler, 12 Scott Williams, 11 Tom Williams, 10 Luke Price, 9 Shaun Venter; 1 Rhodri Jones, 2 Scott Otten, 3 Ma'afu Fia, 4 Marvin Orie, 5 Lloyd Ashley, 6 Dan Lydiate (c), 7 Olly Cracknell, 8 Morgan Morris .</p>

        <figcaption>Clermont beat Harlequins in the semi-finals of last season's Challenge Cup</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Mike Brown and Danny Care make their returns from injury while Scott Baldwin starts at hooker as Quins look to snap a two-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>France duo Camille Lopez and Morgan Parra start at half-back for Clermont with Greig Laidlaw on the bench, with All Blacks Isaia Toeava and George Moala named at centre.</p>

        <figcaption>Danny Care is back at scrum-half for Quins</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Parra kicked 16 points during last season's thrilling Challenge Cup semi-final win over Harlequins but his distribution will also be key in unleashing Clermont's world-class backline.</p>
      <p>Quins have missed Care's game management and his quick-thinking around rucks will keep Clermont defenders on their toes.</p>
      <h3>Match fact</h3>
      <p>Clermont have won their opening match in each of their last three Champions Cup campaigns.</p>
      <p><b>Clermont Auvergne:</b> 15 Nick Abendanon, 14 Peter Betham, 13 Isaia Toeava, 12 George Moala, 11 Alivereti Raka, 10 Camille Lopez, 9 Morgan Parra (c); 1 Etienne Falgoux, 2 John Ulugia, 3 Rabah Slimani, 4 Paul Jedrasiak, 5 Sitaleki Timani, 6 Peceli Yato, 7 Alexandre Fischer, 8 Fritz Lee.</p>
