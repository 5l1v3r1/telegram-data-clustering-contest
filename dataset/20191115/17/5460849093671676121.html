      <h4>Quick Take</h4>
      <p>A meme falsely attributes a quote to CNN anchor Don Lemon about Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s death.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>Full Story </h4>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WeWantLibertyNotTyranny/photos/a.481380561945158/2702697863146739/?type=3&amp;theater">popular</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yourcountryusa/photos/a.156901298451910/597386384403397/?type=3&amp;theater">meme</a> circulating on Facebook wrongly attributes a quote to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/profiles/don-lemon-profile">Don Lemon</a>, the CNN anchor who hosts “CNN Tonight.”</p>
      <p>The meme — which uses photos of Lemon and the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who died during a U.S. raid last month — purports that Lemon said that President Donald “Trump killed an unarmed father of three.”</p>
      <p>“Yes, the idiot really said this on live television,” the meme continues.</p>
      <p>The meme claims that Lemon made the remark on Oct. 27 — a Sunday, and the day Trump publicly <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-death-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi/">announced</a> al-Baghdadi’s death. But in reality, Lemon’s show only airs on weekdays and a CNN spokeswoman confirmed to FactCheck.org that Lemon was not on air that day.</p>
      <p>We also checked CNN’s <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/cnnt.html">transcripts</a> for episodes of “CNN Tonight” for the days following al-Baghdadi’s death and found no instances of Lemon saying the dubious quote.</p>
      <p>Other fact-checkers, including <a href="https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/oct/30/facebook-posts/cnn-did-not-call-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-unarmed-fath/">PolitiFact</a>, have written about very similar images that were manipulated to look as if the “unarmed father of three” reference appeared in a chyron on CNN — which it didn’t.</p>
