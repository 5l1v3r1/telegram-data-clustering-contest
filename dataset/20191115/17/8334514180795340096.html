      <p>The latest title, which scored 83% on Metacritic earlier in the day, follows the story of one of the last surviving Jedi as he attempts to rebuild the order.</p>
      <p>In fiscal 2020, EA expects to sell 6 million to 8 million units of the latest title.</p>
      <p>Fextralife, a Twitch streamer with channels views of over 400 million, said the title is a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>“There is a bit too much Uncharted in the game, and I was hoping for more of an action ARPG, akin to Dark Souls,”, the gaming group said.</p>
      <p>The game’s official gameplay trailer garnered over 4 million views on YouTube.</p>
      <p>The previous titles - “Star Wars: Battlefront I” launched in 2015 and “Star Wars: Battlefront II” in 2017 - have sold over 33 million copies combined, EA had said in October.</p>
      <p>Jeff Cohen, analyst with Stephens, expects sales of the latest title to hit 8 million units, given the upcoming movie release.</p>
      <p>The ninth film in the series, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” will hit the theaters by the end of December. “The Mandalorian”, a web series set in the Star Wars universe, was also launched earlier this week on Disney+.</p>
      <p>EA, which had previously canceled four “NBA Live” console titles in its popular basketball series, missed market expectation for 2020 adjusted revenue forecast in October.</p>
      <p>“Pushing out NBA 20 also will clearly impact sales,” Elazar Advisor analyst, Chaim Seigel, said.</p>
      <p>“Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order” is the biggest single-player focused game coming out at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“It has elements of Tomb Raider like environmental puzzles, a God of War style emotional story design and even Batman inspired fluid combat,” Samuel Franklin, founder of gaming recommendation website Games Finder said.</p>
      <p>According to Cowen analysts, the sales for latest Star Wars title could grow to 11 million units on consoles, estimating that every incremental million unit will add about 7 cents to earnings per share.</p>
