      <h1>Taco Bell Wants You To Make Taco Soup For Thanksgiving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:47:12+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:47</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Diamond</a></address>
      <p>Thanksgiving dinner. Or lunch. Or whatever you call it when you serve a meal at 3:30 in the afternoon. The big question is what do you bring? Of course there will be turkey, ham, dressings, multiple veggie dishes, and usually about one full dessert item for each person in attendance.</p>
      <p>Taco Bell wants you to think a little differently. They posted a <a href="https://www.tacobell.com/blog/friendsgiving-rolled-chicken-tacos-bisque-recipe">complete recipe for Rolled Chicken Tacos Bisque on their blog</a> the other day and it looks delicious!</p>
      <p>Of course it starts with six Rolled Chicken Tacos from Taco Bell, but it also includes a ton of other tasty ingredients.</p>
