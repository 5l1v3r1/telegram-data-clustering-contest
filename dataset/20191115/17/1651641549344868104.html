      <h1>Samsung confirms the Galaxy Fold 2 for the first time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rahul</a></address>
      <p>Samsung is one of the major tech companies who is actively pushing the foldable device category and even though the Korean manufacturer hasn’t seen much success with the Galaxy Fold, rumors earlier suggested that the company is working on version two of the existing Galaxy Fold, which will be called Galaxy Fold 2.</p>
      <p>It turns out that the rumors were true. For the first time, on a support page, Samsung Africa’s site has confirmed the existence of the Galaxy Fold 2 by making reference to an unannounced device with model number SM-F700F. That’s the model number of the existing Galaxy Fold and unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the Galaxy Fold 2 will have the exact same model number as the original Galaxy Fold.</p>
      <p>In other words, it might well be a hint from Samsung that the Galaxy Fold 2 is in the making and is soon going to be launched. Unfortunately, there was no other information related to the product except for the model number, leaving us in the dark about the design and specifications of the upcoming foldable smartphone.</p>
      <p>However, if rumors are to be believed, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-teases-clamshell-folding-galaxy-fold-2-at-sdc-2019/">Samsung’s Galaxy Fold won’t look like the original Galaxy Fold</a> as the company is adopting a clamshell design. This means that Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 might share a similar design with the recently-launched Motorola RAZR folding smartphone. Rumor also has it that the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/the-samsung-galaxy-fold-2-will-likely-support-the-s-pen/">Galaxy Fold 2 will have support for the S Pen</a>.</p>
      <p>Samsung is expected to present the new device formally at Mobile World Congress 2020, for release later in the year.</p>
