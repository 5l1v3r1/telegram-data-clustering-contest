      <h1>ROBERT DOWNEY JR. Back as IRON MAN for Disney+'s WHAT IF...?, According to Co-Star</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:03:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Arrant, Editor</a></address>
      <p>Robert Downey Jr. will reprise his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man for Disney+'s upcoming animated series <b>What If...?</b>, according to co-star Jeff Goldblum.</p>
      <p>Goldblum has revealed one episode will feature his Grandmaster character (from <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>) and Downey's Iron Man - yes, with Downey voicing the role himself.</p>
      <p>"This episode included the Grandmaster and Iron Man," said Goldblum. "So [Robert Downey Jr.] will do a voice in that. And Korg, Taika Waititi, had already recorded his voice for that."</p>
      <p>While at first blush this might be somewhat surprising given Stark's death in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, Marvel Studios' <b>What If...?</b> (like the original comic book) revisits classic moments and shows alternate scenarios, allowing - and in some cases, encouraging - these type of surprises.</p>
