      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> is taking a break from the screen tonight in order to clear the schedule for Children in Need.</p>
      <p>In recent scenes, viewers were left stunned after a dramatic episode last night which saw Mel Owen <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/eastenders-spoilers-aftermath-mel-owen-death-11149702/">die in an car crash,</a></p>
      <p>And if that wasn’t enough, Lisa told Phil (Steve McFadden) that Mel’s untimely death was a result of her finding out that Sharon’s baby isn’t his.</p>
      <p>How will it all unfold? You’ll have to wait until Monday to find out.</p>
      <p>In cheerier news, some of the cast will take a break from Walford tonight to take part in the BBC’s Children in Need telethon.</p>
