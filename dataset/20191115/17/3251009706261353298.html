      <p>As simple and effortless as they look, pre-wedding shoots are not that simple. There are a few things that you need to consider and pay attention to before the shoot even takes place. Study these dos and don’ts carefully to help you prepare the perfect shoot.</p>

      <p>First and foremost, the most important step of all is to do your research. On what? On everything related to the shoot – like location, wardrobe, and especially your photographer and concept.</p>

      <p>It is very important to plan your shoot very carefully. Some couples want to spare the nitty-gritty and just go with whatever is trending.</p>

      <p>There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s just that the photos will come out as “just another engagement shoot” and not reflect you as a couple, let alone your personality.</p>

      <p>Talking about time, there are two things you need to consider. The shoot itself has to be done at the right time, not too close to and not too far off from the wedding day.</p>

      <p>As the photographer will need time to edit the pictures, don’t do it too close to the wedding.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, don’t do the shoot too far off from the wedding date so your guests will also feel the excitement leading up to your wedding day.</p>
