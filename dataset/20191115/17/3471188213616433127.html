      <h1>Confirmation from Spotify that real-time lyrics are in testing for some users</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:54:42+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Tann</a></address>
      <p>It seems that the latest trend in streaming music is to sync real-time lyrics to displays. Google Play Music has delivered scrolling lyrics on Home and Nest Hub devices for a while now. Apple Music followed when iOS updated recently and recently we saw Spotify doing the same on Smart Displays.</p>
      <p>That functionality has extended to the Spotify app in a limited test run according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/spotify-confirms-its-testing-real-time-lyrics-synced-to-music/%E2%80%9D">information obtained by Techcrunch</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Several users in international markets are now seeing a similar synced lyrics feature in their Spotify mobile app, where lyrics scroll by in time with the music. The feature is powered by Musixmatch, according to the screenshots. Spotify confirmed to TechCrunch the feature is a test in a limited number of markets.</blockquote>
      <p>I’ve not seen or heard from any local users who have had the function enabled, so Australia doesn’t seem to be on the testing run at this time. Mexico, USA, Canada and Indonesia seem to be the only regions covered.</p>
      <p>Spotify are the big fish in what seems to be a shrinking pond and smartly, are doing what they need to in order to retain users.</p>
