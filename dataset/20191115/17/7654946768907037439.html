      <p>A Long Island man was arrested for stalking a 14-year-old girl for at least three weeks in Suffolk County, police said.</p>
      <p>George Letellier allegedly followed the teen in his gray Jeep wrangler and engaged her in “inappropriate conversation” several times between Oct. 16 and Nov. 7 in Huntington Station, Suffolk County cops said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>During one of the incidents, Letellier “invaded” the girl’s personal space and prevented her from getting away from him, police said.</p>
      <p>On a fourth occasion, the brave teen managed to get Letellier’s license plate and reported him to police, who promptly arrested him and charged him with stalking in the 4th degree and endangering the welfare of a child.</p>
      <p>Police couldn’t immediately say what the inappropriate conversation was or how many times Letellier interacted with the teen.</p>
