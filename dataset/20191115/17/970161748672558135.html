      <p>The latest NPD charts have shown The Outer Worlds to be a surprise hit and that fighting games have had their best year ever.</p>
      <p>There are no surprises as to what the best-selling game of October was, in the latest NPD charts, but not only is Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare number one, it only took nine days to become the best-selling game of the year so far in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Although its debut in the UK charts seemed a little underwhelming, they don’t include digital sales, whereas the American ones do.</p>
      <p>Either way though, American and British tastes in games are similar enough that Modern Warfare will almost certainly end up being the biggest game of the year here too, with the only real competition – as usual in a non-Rockstar year – being <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fifa/">FIFA</a>.</p>

      <p>Also of interest in the US chart is the unexpectedly strong performance of The Outer Worlds, which proves that the thirst for a Fallout-esque game that actually works is still strong.</p>

      <p>What that means for a sequel is unclear though as the game was signed up by Take-Two before developer Obsidian was bought by Microsoft, who could now feasibly make the sequel an Xbox exclusive.</p>
      <p>Also performing well was Luigi’s Mansion 3, whose chart position does not take into account digital sales, and Ring Fit Adventure – which has also performed very strongly in Japan, even if it doesn’t seem to have done much business here.</p>
      <p>Although they still haven’t released any sales figures, NPD were unusually forthcoming with other snippets of information, revealing that the Nintendo Switch was the best-selling console of October and of the year as a whole.</p>
      <p>They also revealed that fighting games have had their best year ever in the States, although almost all of those sales are due to Mortal Kombat 11 – which is disproportionally popular in the U.S. compared to the rest of the world – and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.</p>
      <p>Below, you can see both the October top 10 and the top 10 sellers of the year so far. That top 10 is definitely subject to change though, as Pokémon Sword and Shield, and perhaps Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order are certain to make an appearance in the final list.</p>
