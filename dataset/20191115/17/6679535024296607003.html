      <p>Taking an indirect jibe at the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Nalin Kumar Kateel, State BJP president and Dakshina Kannada MP, on Friday said those who have gained by taking the name of Kanakadasa have done little for the great reformer.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Kanaka Jayanti celebrations organised by the district administration here, Mr. Kateel said, “While those who have gained by taking the name of the Kanakadasa did nothing, it was Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa who took up the work of developing Kaginele (the birthplace of Kanakadasa),” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kateel said Kanakadasa who pleased god with his “Bhatki Siddanta” did not link god with any religion.</p>
      <p>This great reformer from the Bhakti movement is a world saint and should not be restricted to the community he belonged to.</p>
      <p>The MP commended the State government for organising Kanaka Jayanti that helps to profess ideals of the great reformer that needs to be imbibed.</p>
