      <p>If the Neiman Marcus Christmas Book isn't the peak of holiday season, I don't know what is. The luxury department chain's annual catalog of top-tier <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525081&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neimanmarcus.com%2Fc%2Fgifts-christmas-book-cat75250765&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fculture%2Fa29802412%2Fneiman-marcus-fantasy-gifts-2019%2F">holiday gifts</a> are well worth getting on Santa's nice list for—a $35,000 Moët and Chandon vending machine, anyone?—and past <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jaw-dropping-neiman-marcus-fantasy-gifts_n_56339abee4b0c66bae5c2e7b">Fantasy Gifts include</a> everything from a $150,000 Arch motorcycle designed by Keanu Reeves to a $20 million submarine.</p>
      <p>The <i>Christmas Book</i> was first published in 1926 as a 16-page booklet and delivered as a Christmas card to Neiman Marcus' best customers. Over the past six decades, it's expanded to signify the ultimate in luxury gifting. Neiman Marcus celebrates the 60th anniversary of Fantasy Gifts this year, and you better believe the company hasn't held back when it comes to this year's gifts.</p>
