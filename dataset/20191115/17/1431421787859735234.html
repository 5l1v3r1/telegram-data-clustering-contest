      <h1>Netflix Makes Changes to Holocaust Series Following Polish Claims of 'Historical Inaccuracies'</h1>
      <h2>Move comes after Polish Prime Minister complained that the streaming giant's series about the trial of Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk shows a map of Nazi death camps inside the borders of modern Poland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:34:03+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968188" target="_blank">DPA</a></address>
      <p>Netflix said it would add explanatory text to some of the maps featured in the Holocaust documentary series "The Devil Next Door" after the Polish government accused the streaming giant of "historical inaccuracies." </p>
      <p>Move comes after Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki complained that the streaming giant's series about the trial of <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/life/television/.premium-netflix-s-the-devil-next-door-tackles-the-biggest-true-crime-the-holocaust-1.8084030">Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk</a>, a Ukrainian man who later made a life for himself in the U.S., "involved a map that falsely places several German <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-nazis-1.5599148">Nazi</a> concentration camps within modern-day Poland's borders."</p>
      <p>"There is no comment or any explanation whatsoever that these sites were German-operated," <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/poland-asks-netflix-to-make-changes-to-documentary-about-nazi-death-camp-guard-1.8110913">Morawiecki said on Monday</a>, adding that the map "deceived viewers into believing that Poland was responsible for establishing and maintaining these camps, and for committing the crimes therein."</p>
      <p>In response, Netflix said it will be adding text to some of the maps featured in the series.</p>
      <p>"This will make it clear that the extermination and concentration camps in Poland were built and operated by the German Nazi regime who invaded the country and occupied it from 1939-1945," a Netflix statement issued late Thursday said.</p>
