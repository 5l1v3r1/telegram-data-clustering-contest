      <p>THE Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring, has praised everybody associated with Sancta Maria College, Louisburgh, on the completion of their new school facilities in time for their centenary celebrations.</p>
      <p>The construction project at Louisburgh comprised the demolition of part of the existing school building, construction of a new extension of approximately 2,716m. squared and refurbishment of the remainder of the existing school building.</p>
      <p>Minister Ring said: “After two years of work it’s great to see this new building finished and being put to use by the school and the local community.</p>
      <p>“The new extension includes a new main entrance, 12 specialist classrooms, a general purpose room, a PE Hall and ancillary accommodation.</p>
      <p>“This investment of €9.5 million shows this government’s continued commitment to rural Ireland.</p>
      <p>“The principal, Ms. Pauline Moran, her staff and the board of management deserve great praise for delivering on this project which will serve Louisburgh well for years to come.”</p>
