      <p>Four jets have been launched in quick succession from HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time ever.</p>
      <p>The four F-35 Lightning jets took off from the giant aircraft carrier off the coast of the USA.</p>
      <p>The operation took place as part of Westlant 19 -  a three-month exercise where aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, F-35s and supporting units are being rigorously tested under realistic warfighting scenarios, while visiting Canada and the USA.</p>
      <p>The exercise was described as "absolutely awe inspiring to watch, hear and feel."</p>
      <p>HMS Queen Elizabeth's official Twitter account said: "We have flown our first UKF35 multi-ship, launching 4 jets in quick succession and recovering on completion of their ‘mission’.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week HMS Queen Elizabeth <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/royal-navy-carrier-hms-queen-3533817">welcomed two new ships</a> to its 'strike group'.</p>
      <p>USS Philippine Sea and USS Truxtun, the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser and Arleigh Burke-class destroyer have joined us as UKF35 jet trials continue in the Atlantic off the coast of the USA.</p>
      <p>HMS QE also brought its renewed Carrier Strike Group capability online with a refuel at sea involving bridge work with HMS Northumberland.</p>
      <p>"Welcome to the Queen Elizabeth Carrier Strike Group, USS Philippine Sea and USS Truxtun," said HMS Queen Elizabeth's official Twitter account.</p>
      <p>"The Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser and Arleigh Burke-class destroyer have joined us as #UKF35 jet trials continue in the USA #WESTLANT19 #jointcapability."</p>
