      <h1>Online shopping addiction 'is a mental health condition', psychotherapists claim</h1>
      <h2>Researchers from Hannover Medical School claim that the so-called ‘buying-shopping disorder’ (BSD) should have its own classification</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:29:03+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Whether it’s ASOS or Amazon, when it comes to shopping these days, many of us will turn to the internet.</p>
      <p>But while some people only occasionally shop online, it seems that for others the habit is becoming an addiction - so much so that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/psychology">experts</a> believe that it should be classed as a ‘mental health condition.’</p>
      <p>Researchers from Hannover Medical School claim that the so-called ‘buying-shopping disorder’ (BSD) should have its own classification, rather than its current listing as ‘other specified impulse control disorder.’</p>
      <p>Dr Astrid Muller, who led the study, said: “It really is time to recognise BSD as separate mental health condition and to accumulate further knowledge about BSD on the Internet.”</p>
      <p>The condition is characterised by an extreme preoccupation with, and craving for, shopping, as well as urges to own certain goods.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Worryingly, people with the condition also tend to buy more than they can afford or use.</p>
      <p>And in the long run, the condition can lead to extreme distress, family issues, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hoarding">hoarding</a> of goods and even embezzlement, according to the researchers.</p>
      <p>In the study, the researchers analysed data from earlier studies reporting on 122 patients seeking treatment for BSD.</p>
      <p>The researchers hope their findings will encourage mental health experts to explore the condition, especially given the reason boom in the online shopping industry.</p>
      <p>Dr. Muller added: "We hope that our results showing that the prevalence of addictive online shopping among treatment-seeking patients with BSD will encourage future research addressing the distinct phenomenological characteristics, underlying features, associated comorbidity, and specific treatment concepts."</p>
