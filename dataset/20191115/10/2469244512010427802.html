      <p>South west law firm, WBW Solicitors, has received multiple awards from Cancer Research UK, in recognition of the amount of money the firm and its clients have raised for the charity.</p>
      <p>The firm, which has nine offices in the south west and serves many clients from across Devon and Cornwall, has been supporting Cancer Research UK’s will scheme, for people aged 55 and over, since 1998. Since then, the firm and its clients have contributed nearly £10.5 million through pledges as part of the scheme.</p>
      <p>Catherine Causey, head of private clients at WBW said: “We would like to thank all of our clients who have pledged donations to this imperative charity.</p>

      <p>"Our Paignton office is one of two firms close to raising £5 million for CRUK. This will this be the first time a solicitors has reached this amount in the entire country, to be in the running for this record is a historic moment for the firm. We are very proud of our achievements and look forward to continuing to support the charity’s vital work.”</p>
      <p>Clare Moore, director of legacies at Cancer Research UK, said: “We all reach a stage at some point in our lives where we start to look ahead and consider what will happen to our financial affairs in the future, when we may no longer be around.</p>
      <p>“Our free will service is provided without obligation and we are so grateful to WBW for the expertise and sensitivity they show in providing clear information and guidance to help people in Devon make the best choices for them.</p>

      <p>“By combining dedication with the highest professional standards, WBW has facilitated nearly £10.5 million worth of legacy gifts, which will go a long way towards helping our scientists, doctors and nurses to beat cancer sooner.</p>
      <p>“It’s thanks to these vital donations and the generosity of our supporters that we are able to keep making progress in the fight against the disease.”</p>
      <p>Gifts in wills fund over a third of the charity’s life-saving research. Cancer Research UK funds 4,000 scientists, doctors and nurses and their vital ongoing work.</p>
