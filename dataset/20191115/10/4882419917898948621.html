      <p>Gareth Bale's agent Jonathan Barnett is looking for a Premier League home for the Welsh winger. Real Madrid aren't in favour of his eccentricities and the fan base are tired of his injuries.</p>
      <p>Bale has not played for Madrid for a month, or trained, since getting injured with Wales on the last international break. However he is back with his country training for the next round of internationals this week.</p>
      <p>Barnett might be able to take him to one of the London clubs. Madrid would be happy to let him go and save 35m euro for the next two years on his contract.</p>
      <p>He is sounding out the London sides, inclujding Tottenham, where he arrived from - and their north London rivals Arsenal.</p>
