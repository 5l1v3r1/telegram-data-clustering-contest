      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/lonely-robot-space-themed-exploration-and-sonic-sounds">Lonely Robot</a> have revealed that they’ll head out on tour in 2020 for a series of ‘An Evening With’ shows.</p>
      <p>John Mitchell, Craig Blundell, Steve Vantsis and Liam Holmes have announced a total of five dates which will see them play tracks from <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/lonely-robot-please-come-home"><i>Please Come Home</i></a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/lonely-robot-the-big-dream-album-review-1"><i>The Big Dream</i></a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/lonely-robot-under-stars-album-review"><i>Under Stars</i></a>.</p>
      <p>These will be “brought fiercely to life with stunning visuals and atmospherics all delivered with as much pomp and circumstance as our four intrepid heroes can muster.”</p>
      <p>The statement continues: “It truly will be out of this world. Make sure you are onboard for this interstellar musical and visual ride!”</p>
      <p>The final part of their astronaut trilogy, <i>Under Stars</i>, was released earlier this year, with Mitchell explaining: “I wanted to reference my love of 80s synthwave pop a little more – so beware the 808!</p>
      <p>“The title is derived from the belief that we as humans spend far too much time not noticing the beauty around us and far too much time tethered to technology.”</p>
