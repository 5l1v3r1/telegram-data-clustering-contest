      <blockquote>​"I found him in a skip in Burscough 18 years ago. I was only 12 and thought he was cool so I kept him. He was named Duncan, I don't know why, and he has been in my family for the last 18 years", the man, who preferred to remain anonymous, told journalists.</blockquote>
      <p>He added, that Duncan had recently been recovered from a friend's business, and was placed on a nearby roundabout as a joke.</p>
