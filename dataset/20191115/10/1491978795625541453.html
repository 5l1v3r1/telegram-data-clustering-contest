        <i>England manager Gareth Southgate said he was disappointed in fans for booing Joe Gomez during his side's 7-0 demolition of Montenegro. <br/><br/>Gomez was involved in a bust-up with Raheem Sterling earlier in the week. Despite both players considering the matter settled before England's Euro 2020 qualifier, some supporters still booed Gomez when he came on for Mason Mount in the second half. <br/>Speaking after the game, Tammy Abraham said the fans' reaction was 'unacceptable'. </i>
