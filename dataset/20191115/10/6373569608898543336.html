      <h1>Ryan Lowe reveals lots of players want to sign for Plymouth Argyle in January</h1>
      <h2>Lowe and assistant boss Steven Schumacher are already checking out potential targets</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:00:53+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>There is already a lot of interest from players wanting to sign for Plymouth Argyle in the January transfer window, manager Ryan Lowe has said.</p>
      <p>It is not much more than six weeks until clubs across the EFL can resume making additions to their squads.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims’ boss admitted it was ‘starting to get a bit busy’ with agents of players contacting him.</p>
      <p>Lowe and his assistant manager, Steven Schumacher, are also getting out and about to check on potential targets.</p>
      <p>That is with the aim of mounting a League Two promotion push over the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>The pair both ran the rule over Everton Under-23s when they played Argyle in a Premier League Cup tie at Southport last Sunday.</p>
      <p>That opens up the possibility of a loan deal for one of those who lined up for Everton.</p>
      <p>Lowe and Schumacher had watched the Premier League Cup group game between Blackburn Rovers and Middlesbrough at Leyland last Friday.</p>
      <p>Schumacher also attended the Professional Development League fixture between Bristol City and Cardiff City at Weston-super-Mare on Monday.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “We are building connections left, right and centre. We were at Blackburn-Middlesbrough last week.</p>
      <p>“Schuey was at Bristol City-Cardiff on Monday. Obviously, we watched Everton as well, looking at some of their players.</p>
      <p>“So the opportunities arise all the time, but while they could be a good footballer they have got to be the right fit.</p>
      <p>“They have got to want to come and play for Argyle. They have got to want to buy into what we are doing, and be able to play the way we want to play.</p>
      <p>“Our eyes and ears are open 24/7 especially now it’s starting to get a bit busy.</p>
      <p>“People are asking ‘Do you want this, do you want that?’ Agents are on the phone.</p>
      <p>“But one thing I can say is there is a lot of people that are raving about us and talking about us for the right reasons and want to come and join the ride, so for me that’s very pleasing.”</p>
      <p>Over recent days, two players have left Argyle, with midfielders Cameron Sangster and Jose Baxter both moving on.</p>
      <p>Sangster, 19, has quit football to concentrate on his business interests. He co-owns an independent company which sells classic football boots to some of the world’s top players.</p>

      <p>Baxter left Argyle by mutual consent on Thursday after failing to recover from a persistent calf injury.</p>
      <p>His short-term contract with the Pilgrims was set to end in January and it was unlikely he would have played much, if at all, before then.</p>
      <p>So the decision was taken by both parties to go their separate ways.</p>
      <p>There are set to be more departures from Home Park during January, both on permanent deals and loans, as well as new recruits to the Argyle squad.</p>
