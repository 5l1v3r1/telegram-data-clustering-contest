      <h1>Amazon is selling the new 16-inch MacBook Pro for $100 less than Apple</h1>
      <h2>The device was only revealed two days ago.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:22:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/rachel-england" target="_blank">Rachel England</a></address>
      <p>Apple unveiled its redesigned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-specs-pricing-hands-on-video/">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> just two days ago, and Amazon has already jumped in with a sale -- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081FWLDZ2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=c86ca5532baf978bf906f00dff9b70dd&amp;language=en_US">$2,300</a> instead of Apple's list price of $2,399. It's a big spend either way, but that $100 saving will definitely sweeten what's an already-appealing offering for MacBook fans.</p>
      <p>It replaces the similarly-sized 15-inch model. It's fast, it's light and â€“ drumroll -- it has a new keyboard. This is a major USP for the device, given the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/23/apple-macbook-keyboard-next-day-repairs-in-store/">unrelenting problems</a> it's had over the last year. The new model features a new Magic Keyboard designed to address previous issues, plus the oft-requested physical Escape key.</p>
      <p>With such a major launch so close to the holidays, it's pretty unlikely you're going to find one for a lower price this side of Christmas, which means it's going to be a popular deal and won't last long. Move quickly if you want to be one the first to own Apple's newest flagship tech.</p>
