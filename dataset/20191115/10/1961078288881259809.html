      </h3>
      <p>Sides are almost everyone’s favorite part of the Thanksgiving meal. We have recipes for <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020593-vegan-stuffing">vegan stuffing</a> and <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020592-vegan-mashed-potatoes">mashed potatoes</a>, and a dreamy mushroom <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017760-vegan-mushroom-make-ahead-gravy">gravy</a> to pour on top. You can pile this <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020616-vegan-mac-and-cheese">vegan macaroni and cheese</a> into a pretty baking dish and top with seasoned bread crumbs for that special occasion vibe. Don’t forget the flaky <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12949-vegan-quick-biscuits">biscuits</a>. And if your Thanksgiving table isn’t complete without a Jell-O mold, this garnet-colored <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015472-cranberry-orange-jelly">cranberry orange jelly</a> is for you.</p>

      <p>Melissa Clark’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019029-wild-rice-and-mushroom-casserole">wild rice and mushroom casserole</a> is creamy, rich and satisfying. Pizza for Thanksgiving? This colorful <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12946-roasted-apple-butternut-squash-and-caramelized-onion-pizza">roasted apple, butternut squash and caramelized onion pizza</a>, which has “cheese” made from a purée of white beans and garlic, would be a lively addition to the table. If you long for a traditional carving moment, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016041-whole-roasted-cauliflower-with-romesco">roast a head of cauliflower</a> and slice it at the table. Drizzle it with a vibrant romesco sauce. Savory pie, like <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013877-harvest-tart-with-pumpkin-and-peppers">this harvest tart with pumpkin and peppers</a>, is always a good idea. But for something truly unforgettable, trot out this <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020596-vegetarian-mushroom-wellington">mushroom Wellington</a>. You’ll need to make a few substitutions to make it vegan: Use vegan puff pastry (like Pepperidge Farm and Mazor’s), an egg substitute for brushing the puff pastry and a butter substitute for the port reduction and caramelized onions.</p>

A reader favorite, this <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019746-roasted-garlic-and-white-bean-dip-with-rosemary">creamy white bean dip</a> has an entire head of roasted garlic in it (Don’t let that scare you; it’s sweet and mellow.)
