      <h3>RIZAL, Nueva Ecija - The police and the military clashed with a 7-man group of suspected terrorist Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army rebels allegedly conducting extortion activities in a barangay here resulting in the killing of two rebels, wounding of four and the arrest of another insurgent on Thursday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>Provincial police director Col. Leon Victor Rosete identified the slain suspected terrorists as Michael Pagkaliwanagan alias Allan Ledesma and one alias Miguel.</p>
      <p>Wounded were four rebels identified as Lisel Labo alias Nido, Carlos Aguilar alias Badong, Danilo Sagun, and Redsa Balatan, alias Sining.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, nabbed was suspect-rebel Ernesto Quimzon.</p>
      <p>Rosete said the armed encounter transpired at Purok Bulbodozer, Bgy. Estrella at 2:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>He said an earlier intelligence report revealed that a certain group of rebels were allegedly extorting money in the form of revolutionary taxes from residents in the area.</p>
      <p>Rosete said this led to a joint police-military operation which led to an encounter that caused the death of two rebels, wounding of four, the arrest of one terrorist and the recovery at the clash site of two M-16 rifles, two cal.45 pistols, a hand grenade, 14 mobile phone SIM cards, a Samsung tablet, two handheld radios and several subversive documents.</p>
      <p>Major Amado Gutierrez, Army 7th Infantry Division spokesman, said the recovered firearms and other items during the clash were presented by Major General Lenard T. Agustin at the Fort Magsaysay camp to the media yesterday.</p>
