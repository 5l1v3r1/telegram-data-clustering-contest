      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahendra-Singh-Dhoni">Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a> has hit the nets in his hometown Ranchi but it is unlikely that the talismanic former captain will make himself available for the upcoming limited-overs home series against the West Indies next month.</p>
      <p>Dhoni, who has not played a competitive game since the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019">World Cup</a> semifinal against New Zealand in July, had a net session at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/JSCA-Stadium">JSCA Stadium</a> in Ranchi on Thursday, raising hopes of a comeback.</p>
      <p>However, he remains unavailable for the three T20Is and as many ODIs against the West Indies starting December 6 in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>"He is not available for the West Indies series," a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bcci">BCCI</a> official said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Ever since that World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand, Dhoni's future has been a subject of intense speculation but the player himself has not spoken a word on it.</p>
      <p>The Indian team, as mentioned by chief selector MSK Prasad, seems to have moved on with Rishabh Pant becoming the number one choice in the shorter formats.</p>
      <p>Host broadcaster wanted Dhoni to commentate in India's first-ever Day/Night Test, against Bangladesh, from November 22-26, but he will not be doing that as he remains a contracted player of the BCCI</p>
      <p>As per the existing constitution, Dhoni commentating would have also amounted to conflict of interest.</p>
