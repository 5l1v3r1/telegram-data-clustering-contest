      <p>E3 2018 kicked off with a bang from Microsoft, which had plenty of new games to whet the appetite. An overwhelming amount, in fact, but Halo fans around the world only cared about one: the announcement of Halo Infinite. </p>
      <p>This new Halo game was one of the biggest announcements of Microsoft's briefing at E3 2018, and it was a similar story at E3 2019 too. You can watch the official Halo Infinite announcement trailer above, and carry on reading to find out all we know so far.</p>
      <h3>When is Halo Infinite coming out?</h3>
      <p>Like a lot of games announced at E3, there's no official release date for Halo Infinite. There's not even a launch year. "We still have a long way to go until we ship the game," said the developer in 2018.</p>
      <p>That's still true in 2019, with confirmation at E3 2019 that Halo Infinite won't be released until Christmas 2020 - while that's still some way away, there's some solace in the fact that it'll be one of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/game/xbox-project-scarlett-3668196/">next-gen Project Scarlett</a> launch titles.</p>
      <p>We were hoping for a bit more news on the title at November 2019's X019 event, but sadly we didn't even get a hint of more Halo, with the focus instead on the beginning of the rollout of the Master Chief Collection, starting with Halo: Reach in December.</p>
      <h3>What platforms will Halo Infinite be on?</h3>
      <p>As you might expect, Halo Infinite is an Xbox exclusive in the console world (on both Xbox One and the upcoming next Xbox) but you'll also be able to play it on Windows 10 PCs.</p>
      <h3>What will Halo Infinite be like?</h3>
      <p>There are only a few details about Halo Infinite at the moment but here's what we know so far.</p>
      <p>For starters, it's being developed by 343 Industries which has been making Halo games since Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary in 2011.</p>
      <p>Halo Infinite will focus on the Master Chief and continue his saga after the events of Halo 5. In the trailer above, you can see him plug a small card into the back of his helmet which most likely contains Cortana.</p>
      <p>We also know that the new Halo game will be built on the new Slipspace Engine which is shown off in the trailer.</p>
      <p>"When we started this project, the team’s vision for the game was ambitious – so much so that we knew we had to build new tech to fully realize our goals for Halo Infinite. The E3 demo showcases some of the exciting potential of this technology – everything you see is running in-engine. We still have a long way to go until we ship the game, so things will certainly evolve between now and the release of Halo Infinite, though the engine demo is a clear indication of the direction we are heading with our next game and a great snapshot of where our tech is right now," said 343 Industries in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3678707-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fgame%2Fhalo-infinite-3678707%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halowaypoint.com%2Fen-us%2Fnews%2Four-journey-begins">blog post</a>.</p>
      <p>It's described as 'the next chapter of the legendary franchise' and although there's not much given away in the trailer, the name might be hinting at an open-world experience.</p>
      <p>At least we know it will feature classic vehicles like the Warthog but 343 also said: "We will have some new and unexpected directions to take folks in"</p>
      <p>The firm also said that fans will get a chance to play the game while it's in development.</p>
      <p>"In the future, you will be able to join early flighting programs that will let members of the community play the game with us, and give direct feedback, much like the current Insider flighting program for Halo: The Master Chief Collection. It will take some time for us to be ready to kick those flighting events off, but when we do they will start small and grow along the way."</p>
      <p>There's a lengthy gameplay trailer, first showcased at E3 2019, that gives us more of an idea of what to expect from Halo Infinite. You can check that out below:</p>
