      </p>
      <p>Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Rousseau used to say: Peel off the skin of this mystery and eat the tasty fruit inside!</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price</h3>
      <p>We closed the day, November 14 2019, at a price of $8,708. That’s a minor 1.17 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$103.84. It was the lowest closing price in nineteen days.</p>
      <p>We’re still 56 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin market cap</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $157,160,974,644. It now commands 66 percent of the total crypto market.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin volume</h3>
      <p>Yesterday’s volume of $19,084,739,975 was the highest in one day, 18 percent above the year’s average, and 57 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 405 tons of gold.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin transactions</h3>
      <p>A total of 349,854 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 5 percent above the year’s average and 22 percent below the year’s high.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin transaction fee</h3>
      <p>Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.31. That’s $3.40 below the year’s high of $3.71.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin distribution by address</h3>
      <p>As of now, there are 12,565 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 4.9 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.3 percent, and the top 1000 34.4 percent.</p>
      <h3>Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>With a market capitalization of $156 billion, Unilever has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million</h3>

      <p>He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 93.6 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $136,082 by now, according to dickline.info.</p>
