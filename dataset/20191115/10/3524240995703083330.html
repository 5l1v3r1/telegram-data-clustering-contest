      <h1>Bayelsa/Kogi elections: Court begins hearing on suit challenging Bello’s eligibility</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:40:15+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:40</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday, commenced hearing on the suit challenging whether Gov. Yahaya Bello is fit to contest in the November 16 Kogi Governorship election.</p>
      <p>The presiding judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo, however, stood down the case for 30 minutes in order to study a motion filed by Gov. Bello, who is seeking to be joined in the suit.</p>
      <p><i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that while the Social Democratic Party (SDP)’s Candidate in the Saturday’s poll, Natasha Akpoti, is the plaintiff, the All Progressives Congress and the Independent National Electoral Commission are 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.</p>
      <p>At the hearing on Friday, Bello’s lawyer, Mike Enahoro, who filed a motion of a party seeking to be joined in the matter, said he filed the application this morning because they got wind of the case yesterday.</p>
      <p>Counsel to the plaintiff, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, who acknowledged receipt of the motion this morning, hinted that the motion sought to stop court’s proceeding on the matter.</p>
      <p>He, however, argued that the motion is thrown out considering that the election is Saturday.</p>
      <p>On his part, Counsel to the APC, Abdulwahab Mohammed, said he would need more time to study the motion.</p>
      <p>However, Counsel to INEC, Alhassan Umar, SAN, said he had no objection to the motion.</p>
