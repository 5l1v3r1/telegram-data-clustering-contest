      <h1>Community in shock describes school shooting suspect they know</h1>
      <h2>Neighbors, friends come to grips with incident</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:06:12+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:06</time> by <a rel="author">Majlie de Puy Kamp, Noah Broder and Scott Glover, CNN</a></address>
      <p>SANTA CLARITA, Calif. - On his 16th birthday, the student carried a loaded .45 handgun to his high school north of Los Angeles, pulled it out of his backpack and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/us/california-school-shooting/index.html">gunned down five of his classmates</a>, authorities said. He saved the last bullet for himself.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/us/california-school-shooting-suspect/index.html">As the suspect</a> laid in a hospital Thursday night suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, classmates and neighbors struggled to reconcile his alleged actions with the person they knew. He was a good student, an athlete, and friends say, literally a Boy Scout. He'd been hit hard by the recent death of his father, one neighbor said, but otherwise seemed like a typical teenager.</p>
      <p>Sheriff's officials declined to publicly identify the suspect because he is a minor. But two law enforcements sources identified him to CNN as Nathaniel Berhow.</p>
      <p>Investigators had not discovered a motive for the attack as of Thursday afternoon, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Capt. Kent Wegener said at a press conference. Detectives served a search warrant on a residence believed to be the suspect's home, Wegener said. He said there was no history at that address indicative of problems prior to the shooting.</p>
      <p>Another sheriff's official, Tim Murakami, tweeted that rumors that the suspect may have posted threats on social media would be investigated.</p>
      <p>"I literally thought he was a normal kid," said Brizio DelRosario, 16, who ran with Berhow on the Junior Varsity Cross Country team. "We would run together sometimes. The last time I saw him was at a race about 2 weeks ago, he was totally normal. I started next to him and he wished me luck."</p>
      <p>"He wasn't a quiet or a weird kid," DelRosario said.</p>
      <p>Another teammate, who asked that his name not be used, said the student, whom they called Nathan, was in a group of about 7 or 8 friends who all ran track at Saugus High and went to parties together. He said he knew Nathan "very well" and that he is "the sweetest kid you'll ever meet."</p>
      <p>He said he first met Nathan when Nathan was a freshman and he was a sophomore. They became close friends shortly after Nathan's father passed away in 2017.</p>
      <p>"Nathan is shy," the friend said. "I saw Nathan yesterday, we went on a hill run with maybe four guys. He was totally normal, cracking jokes as usual."</p>
      <p>The friend explained that the cross-country team is on off season right now but that they're required to run a mile a day regardless, Nathan had actually suggested the hill run which meant running up a hill behind the Saugus campus and back down through a neighborhood.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the friend went to school for his first period economics class on the upper campus.</p>
      <p>"During class we could see kids running and dropping their backpacks. At first I thought they were running because they were late for second period but then I realized we were still in the middle of first period," he said. "Someone came in and was clearly distressed and said there was a shooter."</p>
      <p>"We turned off the lights and barricaded the door," the student said. "I grabbed scissors just in case I had to fight..." Two of the suspect's five victims were fatally wounded.</p>
      <p>The student in the economics class said he had once gone to a shooting range with Nathan. He said he knew Nathan had access to guns and that he grew up around them but it was never a concern because he knew how to handle them and was responsible.</p>
      <p>He also said Nathan's mom is "the sweetest woman I've ever met" saying that whenever she would drop off or pick up Nathan from practice, she would make it a point to say something kind to the guys.</p>
      <p>Kelly Axen said she has lived next to Berhow and his family for the past 6 and a half years. She said in years past she would pick Nathan up from school, help him with homework and even help to cook his meals.</p>
      <p>She said Berhow appeared to be struggling since the death of his father in 2017 and leaned heavily on his mother and sister for support. His parents divorced in 2016.</p>
      <p>Axen said neither she nor her husband, who has known the family even longer, saw any warning signs for Thursday's shooting.</p>
