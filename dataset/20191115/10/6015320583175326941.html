      <p>Russia considers the planned release of senior Haqqani Network leaders a ‘gesture of goodwill’ from the Afghan government.</p>
      <p>“We have repeatedly said that we welcome any real moves by the opposing forces in the Afghan conflict aimed at ending the armed confrontation and launching a peace process in Afghanistan,” Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia was quoted as saying in a report by TASS.</p>
      <p>Zakharova further added “Within this context, we consider the release from prisons of three leaders of the Haqqani network connected with the Taliban movement (outlawed in Russia), as a gesture of good will from the Afghan government that will help advance the intra-Afghan peace process.”</p>
      <p>President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday announced the Afghan government’s intention regarding the conditional release of three senior Haqqani network leaders including Anas Haqqani, Haji Mali Khan and Hafiz Rashid.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, latest reports indicate that the planned swap of prisoners aimed at releasing the two American University lecturers, has not taken place so far.</p>
