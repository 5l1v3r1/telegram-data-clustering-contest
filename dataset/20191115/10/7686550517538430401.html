      <p>Swansea is set to go crazy golf-crazy when a new adult-themed brand hits the city in December, with students among those expected to enjoy the challenge of taking on the quirky courses.</p>
      <p>BUNKERS! has chosen Swansea to launch its UK operation, with Cardiff set to follow next year.</p>
      <p>It will be family-orientated in the day and an adult-only attraction at night.</p>
      <h3>What can players expect?</h3>

      <p>The two 12-hole crazy golf courses are sure to get you smiling and scratching your head in equal amounts. The tricked-up fairways and layout aim to catch punters out, as each hole poses a fearsome challenge with plenty of surprises thrown in for good measure.</p>
      <p>There is some grown-up entertainment with extravagant theming and spectacular lighting.</p>
      <p>BUNKERS!, in Little Wind Street, is the perfect setting for some fun time with friends and family, with a great offering of cocktails, food, including nachos and hot dogs, and crazy golf, electro darts and ping pong, all combining to generate a lively atmosphere.</p>
      <h3>It will soon be game on!</h3>

      <p>The company behind the concept is Adventure Leisure Limited, which owns and operates 13 existing Mr Mulligans adventure golf venues.</p>
      <p>Now it has turned its attention to the vibrant new idea of BUNKERS!, which is aimed mainly at students and adults, with several new sites in the pipeline to be launched across the UK over the next few years.</p>
      <p>But Swansea has been chosen to tee it off, and, in the words of the company, 'why not?'. It has been working closely with the council and students' unions to generate interest, and has been delighted with the response of the organisations.</p>

      <p>“We are extremely excited to be launching BUNKERS!,” said operations and development director Andrew Scholey. “I’m convinced the brand will provide the perfect blend of a great setting for a night out with some really fun social games that will create a special experience for our guests and keep them coming back.</p>
      <p>“Swansea is an energetic and spirited city which makes it the ideal location to launch our new concept and I have no doubt that the first of many BUNKERS! venues to come will be a big hit.”</p>
