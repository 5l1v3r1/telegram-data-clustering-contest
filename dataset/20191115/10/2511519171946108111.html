      <h2>We're all spending longer getting to and from work</h2>

      <p>Travelling to work is taking longer than ever before with the average daily commute now taking almost an hour according to new research by the TUC.</p>
      <p>Getting to and from work every day is taking 59 minutes, an increase of five minutes from a decade ago, says the trade union body. The equivalent of 221 hours a year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/">TUC </a>analysis found every region in the country has seen an increase in commuting time with the biggest rise being in the South East – up by 31 hours per year.</p>
      <p>The second highest increase is in the North West (26 hours a year) and West Midlands (24 hours a year).</p>
      <p>The TUC said the reason behind this was a lack of investment in transport infrastructure and employers not offering staff more chances to work flexibly – from home or remote working spaces. </p>
      <p>They also highlighted how wages have been stagnant or fallen while house prices are increasing making it difficult for working people to live close to the office. </p>
      <p>TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “We’re now spending a whopping 221 hours a year going to and from work – valuable time which could be spent with family and friends.”</p>
      <p>O’Grady called on the government to re-nationalise trains and buses in order to cut journey times and lower fares. </p>
      <p>Phil Flaxton, chief executive of <a href="https://www.workwiseuk.org/">Work Wise</a>, which campaigns for flexible work, said: “There are many ways of avoiding the misery of commuting during the dark mornings and evenings, which millions of people endure as they struggle to get to and from work. These include implementing flexi-time, staggered working hours and working from home.</p>
      <p>“Clearly the Government, public transport providers and employers must do more in order to address the major negative impact on the UK’s economy, lost productivity and the environment.”</p>
