      <h1>Iraq 'will never be the same' after protests: top Shiite cleric</h1>

      <p>Karbala (Iraq) (AFP) - Iraq will be deeply marked by weeks of demonstrations demanding sweeping reform, its top Shiite cleric said on Friday in some of his strongest remarks yet on the protest movement.</p>
      <p>In his weekly sermon delivered by a representative in the Shiite holy city of Karbala, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani piled pressure on authorities to enact sweeping reforms in response to the deadly demonstrations.</p>
      <p>"If those in power think that they can evade the benefits of real reform by stalling and procrastination, they are delusional," Sistani said.</p>
      <p>"What comes after these protests will not be the same as before, and they should be aware of that."</p>
      <p>Protests erupted on October 1 in an outpouring of anger over high unemployment and widespread corruption but have escalated into demands for root-and-branch reform of the political system.</p>
      <p>Sistani, 89, cautiously backed the demonstrators when they first took to the streets, calling their demands "legitimate."</p>
      <p>But he has firmed up his backing in recent days and on Friday called protests "the honourable way" to seek change.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators have brushed off government promises of reform as too little, too late, and Sistani appeared to do the same on Friday.</p>
      <p>"In response to the protesters' demands, nothing notable has been achieved on the ground so far," he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, he met the United Nations' top official in Iraq to back its phased roadmap for tackling the crisis.</p>
      <p>The plan calls for electoral reforms within two weeks followed by constitutional amendments and infrastructure legislation within three months.</p>
      <p>Parliament received a draft of a new electoral law this week but has yet to begin debating it.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Sistani urged lawmakers to "work quickly to pass a fair electoral law that would restore people's faith in the electoral process".</p>
      <p>"No one can give the government legitimacy but the people... Passing a law that does not provide this opportunity to voters would not be acceptable or useful," he said.</p>
