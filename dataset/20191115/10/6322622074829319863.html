      <p>SEPANG (Nov 15): The recent downgrading of Malaysia's air safety rating to a Category 2 by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will not discourage AirAsia Group from expanding its operations in the United States.</p>
      <p>AirAsia Group Bhd co-founder and group chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said the carrier, which has been consistently named the World’s Best Low-Cost Airline year after year, has so many ways to expand into the large market without Malaysia being the base country.</p>
      <p>"We can't expand to America anymore from Malaysia, but we have so many ways to expand to America. We have AirAsia Japan (for example)," he told a press conference after announcing AirAsia's partnership with Kiwi.com here today.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the FAA downgraded the air safety rating to a Category 2, which prevents the country's airlines from adding new services to the United States.</p>
      <p>Asked whether AirAsia's flights to Hawaii were affected, Fernandes said: "Why should it be affected? Check the law. It has nothing to do with that (the restriction on opening new routes or adding services to the US).</p>
      <p>"Whatever is in operation (will remain) in operation."</p>
