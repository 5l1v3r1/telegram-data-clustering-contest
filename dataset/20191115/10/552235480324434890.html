      <p>Sir <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rod-stewart">Rod Stewart</a> has said it would be "a shame" if Scotland became independent when asked about the UK's political situation.</p>
      <p>However, the singer said he would support Scotland leaving the union "if it was good" for the country.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC Scotland's</a> The Nine programme, Sir Rod also said he believes Boris Johnson "will sort it out", when asked about Brexit.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "I'm somewhat of a traditionalist. It would be a shame to see the British isles break up, it would be a shame to see that blue off the Union Jack. <br/>"But if it's good for Scotland then I'm happy."</p>
      <p>Sir Rod previously spoke out against the idea of Scottish independence ahead of the 2014 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/independence-referendum">referendum</a> , alongside a number of British celebrities.</p>
      <p>When asked about the current political climate, he said: "We're in a muddle, but I think Boris will sort it out.</p>
      <p>"We have to be patient.</p>
      <p>"What I do know is that I was always a remainer. I didn't see why we had to leave.</p>
      <p>Maybe it's something that I'm missing, I don't know, but I'm still a remainer. <br/>"I know Boris is going to get us out."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sir Rod, who described Scotland as his "spiritual home", said the upcoming <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> is of the "utmost importance".</p>
      <p>He added: "It's a once in a lifetime, this election. <br/>"I don't know what the outcome is going to be, I really don't."</p>
