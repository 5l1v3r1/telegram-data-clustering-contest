      <p><b>News</b> by Imogen Beckhelling, Reporter Intern Updated on 15 November 2019</p>
      <p>Next year, Undertale is getting an interactive musical adventure, which will showcase the game's brilliant score and allow the audience to make choices that will influence the performance.</p>
      <p>Undertale LIVE takes place on 11th January at Studebaker Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, and will feature original arrangements from music director Eric Roth, as well as visuals from the game to accompany the music.</p>

      <p>The company producing the show, AWR Music Productions, is also responsible for the "internationally acclaimed" Final Fantasy live music concerts, so it seems Undertale is in good hands.</p>
      <p>There's only one show for Undertale announced so far, the World Premiere - and <a href="https://undertalelive.com/">by the looks of things it's already sold out</a>.</p>
      <p>If the concert is successful maybe we'll see more of this type of production for Undertale - but in the meantime, if you want to hear more music by Undertale's creator, Toby Fox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-01-the-creator-of-undertale-composed-a-song-for-pokemon-sword-and-shield">he recently revealed he composed a track for Pokémon Sword and Shield</a>.</p>
