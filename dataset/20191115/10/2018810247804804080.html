      <p>One of my favourite cosplayers on the planet, Julian Checkley, has spent the last two years working on a Batman outfit that is so good I’m starting to wonder if he’s actually working for Bruce Wayne on the side.</p>
      <p>“Everything was sculpted, moulded and cast in various grades of urethane rubber by me”, Julian says of the enormous suit, which is <i>seven feet tall</i> and weighs <i>150 pounds</i>.</p>

      <p>It’s based on the XE Suit from <i>Batman Arkham Origins’</i> DLC <i>A Cold Heart</i>, which was designed to protect Batman from both bad guys but also the freezing cold temperatures of Mr. Freeze’s attack on Gotham.</p>
      <p>The attention to detail is <i>astounding</i>. Both the boots arms are “semi-active”, in that they’re counter-weighted with bungees and actuators to allow Julian to actually move around in the suit. Which isn’t actually a suit at all, it’s so solid it’s more of an exo-skeleton.</p>

      <p>There are also tiny fog machines built into it as well, which let off little puffs to simulate the heating effects of the suit in the game.</p>
      <p>In addition to the excellence of a thing like this simply existing, Julian also <a href="https://forums.stanwinstonschool.com/discussion/6708/halloween-costume-contest-winner-announcement">won this year’s Stan Winston School of Character Arts Halloween Costume Contest</a>.</p>

      <p>You might remember a few years back <a href="https://cosplay.kotaku.com/batman-cosplay-is-out-of-control-1712955851">we featured Julian’s last Batman work, which I thought was as good as it gets</a>. Turns out I was wrong!</p>
