      <p>BAGHDAD: Iraqi medical and security officials say one protester was killed and over 40 were wounded in renewed clashes overnight in central Baghdad.Protesters have called for large protests to take place on Friday as Iraqi authorities continue to clamp down on the anti-government demonstrations.The officials say the clashes happened in the Khilani area, not far from the epicenter of the protest movement in Tahrir Square, hours after demonstrators celebrated Iraq’s 2-1 World Cup qualifier win over Iran.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations.Amnesty International has said that security forces in Baghdad have fired tear gas grenades directly into the crowd. But Defense Minister Najah al-Shammari said Thursday an investigation has confirmed the tear gas cannisters responsible for protester deaths were not purchased by the government.
