      <p>Wallabies winger Marika Koroibete capped his highly successful transition to rugby union when he was awarded the John Eales Medal as Australia's best player of 2019 late on Thursday.</p>
      <p>SYDNEY: Wallabies winger Marika Koroibete capped his highly successful transition to rugby union when he was awarded the John Eales Medal as Australia's best player of 2019 late on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The former rugby league international, who moved to the 15-man game in 2017, was Australia's best player in a Rugby World Cup campaign that ended in a quarter-final defeat to England last month.</p>

      <p>The Fiji-born back's oustanding individual try in that loss was his fourth of the tournament and took his tally to 12 in 28 tests for Australia over the last two seasons.</p>
      <p>George Smith, David Pocock and Israel Folau are among the previous winners of the award, which was established in 2002 and is the result of a ballot of the players.</p>
      <p>"A lot of great players have won this award so it's a great honour and privilege," the hard-running 27-year-old said.</p>
      <p>"It was always my dream growing up to play rugby (union) at the highest level. I don't know why they voted for me, I just go out there and play for the love of the game."</p>
      <p>Women's captain Grace Hamilton was named Wallaroo of the Year, while Olympic champion Charlotte Caslick won the women's Sevens Players of the Year award.</p>
