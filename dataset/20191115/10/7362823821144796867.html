      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/atlanta-hawks">Hawks</a> guard Kevin Huerter is expected to miss at least two weeks with a left rotator cuff strain.</p>
      <p>Huerter also was diagnosed with a shoulder capsule strain when examined Thursday in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Huerter <a href="https://apnews.com/7ef50e081d8e4c858f1e69b150db120f">left the team’s West Coast trip</a> after he was hurt in <a href="https://apnews.com/c24778d218b64c15bef6966ac2675c50">Tuesday night’s 125-121 victory</a> at Denver.</p>
      <p>The Hawks say Huerter, who is averaging 9.3 points, will have rehabilitation and treatment before being examined again in two weeks.</p>
      <p>Huerter suffered the injury when fouled by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/denver-nuggets">Denver</a>’s Nikola Jokic while going up for a shot. The second-year player immediately grabbed his shoulder and headed to the locker room.</p>
      <p>The Hawks were at Phoenix on Thursday night.</p>
