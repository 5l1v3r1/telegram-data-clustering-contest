      <h1>For Honor update tests new Spectator Mode feature</h1>

      <p>For Honor continues to be one of our favourite fighting games and now players will get to see matches unfold in a more cinematic fashion thanks to the new spectator mode. This feature is now live across all versions of the game though it’s worth noting that this is a beta stress test, the team at Ubisoft Montreal confirming that a full release is coming soon.</p>

      <p>Spectator mode will allow you to watch heroes throw down either from above the battlefield, using freecam, or from a player’s perspective. You’ll only be able to spectate games in which one or more of the combatants is on your friends list. Still, it’s an in-game feature many fans have been requesting and one that Ubisoft will hopefully leverage in its attempts to nurture a serious For Honor competitive scene.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month we saw a new playable hero added to the game – you can read all about our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/05/for-honor-y3s4-gameplay-sun-da-zhanhu/">Y3S4 Zhanhu gameplay impressions</a>.</p>
