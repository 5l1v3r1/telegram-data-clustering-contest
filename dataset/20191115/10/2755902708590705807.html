      <p>Ntombankala Secondary School headmaster in Zhombe has reportedly fled the school  after parents bayed for his blood accusing him of dabbling in Satanism</p>
      <p>The school head, Edson Dube, reportedly fled the school following the mysterious death of a Form Four pupil who fell into a trance linked to satanism.</p>
      <p>Afterwards more pupils started falling into trances and calling out the school head’s name.</p>
      <p>Dube reportedly did not attend the funeral of the deceased pupil and ordered teachers to abscond the funeral as well hence incurring the parents’ wrath and fuelling their rage to hunt him down.</p>
      <p>Kwekwe District Schools Inspector Bernard Mazambani <a href="https://www.bmetro.co.zw/head-flees-school-amid-satanism-scare/">confirmed the development</a></p>
      <aside>“It is still rumours because the matter is yet to get to my office formally. I asked for a written report of which I will be able to comment after seeing a formal report,”said Mazambani.</aside>
      <p>He said Dube had since applied for leave.</p>
