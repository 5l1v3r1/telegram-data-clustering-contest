      <p>Dancehall artiste and Bhim Nation President Stonebwoy is set to drop another banger next week a few months after the release of his ‘Ololo’ song which features Nigerian artiste Teni.</p>
      <p>From what we gather, the song is set to be the song to be used to celebrate this year Christmas just like his ‘Kpoo k3k3’ song did last.</p>
      <p>The new song which features Lynx Entertainment signees Kuami Eugene and Kidi and it’s titled ‘Sobolo’.</p>
      <p>The “Sobolo” song has this highlife and afrobeat feel; one cool song to dance to.</p>
      <p>Just like the success with ‘Kpoo K3k3’, Stonebwoy is hoping to do same with Sobolo.</p>
