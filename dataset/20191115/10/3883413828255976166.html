      <p>American military aircraft have joined UK fighter jets in a training exercise over the North Sea.</p>
      <p>The exercise, known as Point Blank, saw 35 aircraft from 10 units aiming to hone how allies will fight in real-world operations.</p>
      <p>Co-hosted by the 48th Fighter Wing and the RAF, exercise Point Blank aims to provide realistic training for combat forces based in the UK, for a fraction of the cost of sending air personnel to the US.</p>
      <p>Among those taking part was a United States Air Force (USAF) CV-22 Osprey, which is capable of vertical takeoffs and landings.</p>
      <p>The tiltrotor aircraft, which can carry up to 32 troops and has a machine gun on its ramp, was refuelled over the North Sea from an MC-130J Commando II.</p>

      <p>The cargo plane, based at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk, flies clandestine or low-visibility refuelling missions for special operations helicopters and tiltrotor aircraft, and can bring troops and supplies in and out of warzones.</p>
      <p>During the exercise it was in turn refuelled from a KC-135 Stratotanker refueller plane.</p>
      <p>The US aircraft were joined by British Typhoon fighter jets from RAF airbases at Coningsby in Lincolnshire and Lossiemouth in Scotland, which also took part in the exercise.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a previous iteration of Point Blank last year, RAF Air Commodore Jez Attridge said he could see the "challenge that Russia is giving to the international rules-based order", adding "we are the insurance policy".</p>
