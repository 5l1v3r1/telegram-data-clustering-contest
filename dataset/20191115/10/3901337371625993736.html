      <p>At the CAF Women’s Football Strategy Taskforce Workshop in Cairo, FIFA’s Chief Officer for Women’s Football has urged Kaizer Chiefs to form a female team at Naturena.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Chiefs’ Marketing Director, Jessica Motaung, spoke at the workshop as women from across the continent discussed plans to take the women’s game forward in Africa, and Sarai Bareman was full of praise for Motaung, the Amakhosi and what the club can do for the cause.</p>
      <p>The Glamour Boys are the most successful team in South African football in terms of their trophy count over the last 50 years, but as yet there are no ‘Glamour Girls’ for their female fans to cheer on – though that could potentially change in the future. </p>
      <p>As quoted by on their official website, Bareman said, “We have experts from all around Africa, like Jessica, whose expertise in marketing, commercial and knowledge of the game is useful, and we have used this knowledge to build a robust strategy. </p>
      <p>“The great thing about clubs like Chiefs is that they are well established and have good governance structures in place and have big fan bases. A club such as Chiefs can use the resources they have to start establishing women’s team. </p>

      </p>
      <p>“Using the same resources, fan base, and good governance it means there is an investment from the top down and there is a ripple effect. When people see big name clubs like Kaizer Chiefs having a women’s team, they see it is as important and fans also then support the team. This certainly helps and creates a good image for Women’s football.”  </p>
