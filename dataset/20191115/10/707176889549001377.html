      <h2>A timely exhibition is further evidence that Picasso’s ‘weeping woman’ was a talented artist in her own right</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:00:28+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Liz Jobey</a></address>
      <p>“My relations with the rest of the world for the rest of my life do not depend on the fact that I was once acquainted with Picasso,” Dora Maar told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/arts/design/28lord.html">the writer James Lord</a> during a phone call in late 1953, eight years after her affair with Picasso had ended.</p>
      <p>People kept on calling her, she complained, and it was usually to do with Picasso, which was (a) none of their business and (b) very definitely history. Sadly, perhaps, for her, she was wrong.</p>
      <p>Even now, when the art world’s mission to rediscover and promote previously unknown or forgotten women artists has brought increasing prominence to her work, it, like her life, is divided into “before and after Picasso”.</p>
      <p>In the autumn of 1944, when Lord first met her, she was still with Picasso: just. He had already met her successor, Françoise Gilot, and by the following spring Maar would be abandoned and in a state of mental collapse.</p>
      <p>But as the three of them had lunch in Paris, Lord admired Maar, noting her long pale hands, dark painted nails and the gold cigarette holder she kept clamped between her teeth.</p>
      <p>She was, he wrote later, “beautiful, with a strong straight nose, perfect scarlet lips, the chin firm, the jaw a trifle heavy and more forceful for being so, rich chestnut hair drawn smoothly back, and eyelashes like the furred antennae of moths”.</p>
      <p>Even then she must have known it would be impossible to separate Picasso’s life from hers, given the number of times he had drawn and painted her (there are said to be about 60 known portraits) during their eight or nine years together. Reports differ as to when, exactly, their affair began.</p>
      <p>And what has made it even more unlikely is the fact that among those portraits is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/348a1422-83c7-11e1-82ca-00144feab49a">“Weeping Woman” (1937)</a>, one of Picasso’s most memorable paintings, now in the collection at Tate Modern, where an exhibition about Maar’s life and work opens on Wednesday.</p>

      <p>Picasso and Maar first met either late in 1935, at the café Les Deux Magots (according to<a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/brassa%c3%af/"> the photographer Brassaï</a>, with whom she’d shared a darkroom), or in January 1936, at a screening of Jean Renoir’s film <i>Le Crime de M Lange</i>, on which she had been the set photographer.</p>
      <p>Picasso’s first drawing of her is dated August 1 1936 and, thanks to the assiduous assembly of every shred of evidence about him, we also know that three weeks earlier, on July 8, he’d scribbled her name on a scrap of newspaper: “Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora <i>mía</i>”.</p>
      <p>By this time, she was a well-established photographer whose work was published and exhibited; a well-connected member of Paris literary and political society. Maar was a supporter of leftwing political movements including the Groupe Octobre, a theatre group, and in 1934 she was one of the signatories of the manifesto <i>Appel à la lutte</i> (Call to battle), summoning intellectuals and artists to join the fight against fascism.</p>
      <p>In 1935 she joined <i>Contre-Attaque</i> (Counter-Attack), the anti-fascist group founded by the writer and philosopher Georges Bataille, with whom Maar had an affair, and whose sexual practices — his “erotic obsession and will to transgress, as Lord puts it, are thought to have made Picasso even more curious about her.</p>
      <p>Her independence and intellectual acuity were certainly part of the attraction. Throughout their affair, Picasso neither divorced his wife Olga, nor gave up his relationship with his previous mistress, Marie-Thérèse Walter, with whom he had a daughter, Maya. But he was separated from Olga, and Walter was visited in private, so Maar provided him with a striking, clever, accomplished and wilful companion.</p>
      <p>She was born Henriette Theodora Markovitch in Paris in 1907, to a French mother and a Croatian father; before she was three years old the family moved to Buenos Aires. (The fact that Dora spoke Spanish was another bonus for Picasso.)</p>
      <p>During her teens she travelled back and forth between schools in Paris and Buenos Aires before enrolling in 1923 at the Union centrale des Arts décoratifs, and after that at the Ecole technique de photographie et cinématographie, at the same time taking classes at the studio of the painter André Lhote, where she met <a href="https://www.henricartierbresson.org/en/">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>, who would remain a life-long friend.</p>
      <p>Like him, she turned to photography: it offered her a wide range of commercial outlets and an independent living.</p>

      <p>The kind of photographs she took between 1930 and 1935 reflect the rapid changes photography was going through, thanks in part to innovations in the equipment (though she preferred a Rolleiflex to the new, small, 35mm Leica), to the preponderance of fashion and news magazines, all of which needed both editorial and advertising content, and to the rise of Surrealism.</p>
      <p>Photography, with its potential for manipulation and juxtaposition, was a perfect medium for illustrating the dreamlike, the uncanny and the absurd.</p>
      <p>In 1930, she had asked Man Ray if she could be his assistant, but he had turned her down, so she approached a friend, Pierre Kéfer, an art director and set designer, and they set up a studio in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Shortening her name, she began to credit her work to Kéfer-Dora Maar.</p>
      <p>She took fashion photographs and accepted advertising commissions and even provided pictures for erotic magazines. But she also took on street photography and social reportage.</p>
      <p>In 1933, she went to Spain, and the following spring to London, where she focused on the same stark economic and class divisions that successive generations of photographers did after her.</p>
      <p>But as the art historian Marilyn McCully wrote later, her pictures of “street urchins, beggars and blind men . . . suggest that Maar was concerned primarily with the artistic qualities of her images rather than with social documentary”.</p>

        <figcaption>29, rue d’Astorg’, c1936</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>By 1935 she was<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1111f30c-69ac-11df-8432-00144feab49a"> concentrating on Surrealist constructions</a>. Some of her most disturbing images, and those that were frequently exhibited in galleries in Paris and elsewhere, include “Portrait d’Ubu”, 1936, believed to be based on a photograph of an armadillo foetus; “Le Simulateur” (“The Pretender”), 1936, which shows a child trapped inside a hellish underground tunnel and “29, rue d’Astorg”, 1935, a hand-coloured photograph of a stump-headed female figure who sits, one hand to her breast, as if drawing her dress closer to cover herself, on a tilting bench, her stubby stockinged feet not quite reaching the floor.</p>
      <p>This peculiar, disturbing figure is more sinister given that 29, rue d’Astorg was the address of Maar’s studio, where she took her first portraits of Picasso.</p>
      <p>Early in their affair they worked in the darkroom together, Picasso on a series of cliché-verre portraits (paintings or etchings on glass plates that were then placed on photographic paper and exposed to the light). He also photographed Maar.</p>
      <p>But in 1937 he accepted a commission from the Spanish government to paint a mural for the Spanish pavilion of the International exhibition of arts and technology in Paris.</p>
      <p>Maar began to photograph him as he set to work on “Guernica”, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a2020f25-9c58-3ab0-9389-a029738ae4c9">great black and white painting</a> that commemorates the German-Spanish bombing of the Basque town on April 26 1937. During May and June, she made a series of photographs that have provided historians with a major document, showing the stages of the painting as it evolved.</p>
      <p>In 1990, Frances Morris, now director of Tate Modern, visited Maar in Paris. Ostensibly it was to find out more about “Weeping Woman”, which had come to Tate Modern in 1987. But first she asked Maar about “Guernica”. Was it true that Maar had painted some of it herself?</p>
      <p>“Yes,” Maar replied. She had been photographing the painting for Cahiers d’art and they had run out of time. “Picasso said, ‘Go and take the photo and paint the few strokes that are missing on the horse’s leg . . . paint those few strokes’ . . . And then, ‘Take the photo,’ because we had to give the photo to be printed straight away.”</p>

      <p>After “Guernica”, Picasso encouraged Maar to put down her camera and turn to painting. Whether or not she would have made this decision without his interference is impossible to know.</p>
      <p>After she and Picasso returned to occupied Paris in 1940, she moved into a new apartment with a studio in the rue de Savoie, where she remained until her death. Though she continued to paint, she only returned to photography decades later.</p>
      <p>One of the sadnesses about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/12/sir-john-richardson-obituary">the death of John Richardson in March</a> this year is that his great multivolume study of Picasso didn’t get as far as 1936. He knew Maar well.</p>
      <p>She spent summers in a house (bought for her by Picasso) near his then partner Douglas Cooper in the Luberon, and they were witnesses to the aftermath of the break-up, when Maar suffered a nervous collapse, was given electric shock therapy and treated by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan.</p>
      <p>Maar, Richardson writes in an earlier memoir, “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aa908e24-28af-11d9-836c-00000e2511c8">suffered more</a> from Picasso’s cruelty than his other mistresses”. Later, Picasso told Richardson that Maar had frightened him. “I left her out of fear. Fear of her madness,” he says.</p>
      <p>But Richardson will have none of it: “If Dora terrified him, it was surely out of guilt: she held him responsible for her fate.”</p>

      <p>After recovering from her breakdown, Maar turned to the Catholic Church — Lacan, Richardson writes, used religion as “a bridge back to sanity”. Her work was still exhibited periodically and she stayed in touch with old friends such as the Surrealist Leonor Fini and Balthus, but in the years that followed she became increasingly reclusive.</p>
      <p>She continued to paint — many of her works are undated but the gestural landscapes washed with colour belong to a period in the 1950s, and in the 1980s she returned to photography, reworking old negatives, experimenting with geometric shapes on a pale washed ground.</p>
      <p>Periodically, she sold off one or two of the works she had been given by Picasso that she had hoarded in her apartment; many of them were only released in an extended auction sale in 1998, a year after her death.</p>
      <p>Richardson stayed in touch with Maar into old age. She rarely saw anyone, and “if she did see people, she wanted to look presentable and would spend hours manoeuvring her old bones into a vintage Chanel suit”, he wrote. Perhaps she preferred her isolation.</p>
      <p>She was never able to escape the association with Picasso. And maybe, as John Richardson suggests, she didn’t really want to.</p>
      <p>But looking at the contents of this exhibition, which gathers together as much of her work as it has been possible to retrieve, one can only wonder what she would have gone on to do had they never met.</p>
