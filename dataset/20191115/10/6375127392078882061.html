      <h3>WHILE most winning pageant titlists spend most of their reigns living the high life in picture-perfect glitz and glam, Miss World Philippines 2019 Michelle Dee aims to take the higher road defined by positivity and purposeful action.</h3>
      <p>The model/actress asserts, “I believe that pageantry—especially Miss World—has really changed through time. Beauty With A Purpose is their motto, hence it’s not just about finding the prettiest among the group, but finding a girl that has the most to offer not only for her country but to the whole world as well. To gain that kind of platform means gaining a voice that’s heard and listened to.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve always wanted to be someone who can lend a hand to those who need it and someone you can rely on. Something I aspire to become is a pillar of positive influence as well. We have a long way to go in our quest for a perfect world, but it is through example that we can make large waves together. If given the chance to wear the crown, I want to be a queen that doesn’t just have the title, but someone who can actually make a change and won’t settle for less.”</p>
      <p>During her sendoff press conference held last November 13 at Nanka Japanese Steakhouse in Quezon City, organized by Miss World Philippines in collaboration with GMA Network, Michelle disclosed her rigorous training schedule she’s currently been undergoing as part of her preparations for the 69th edition of the Miss World pageant scheduled on December 14 at the ExCel Arena in London, U.K.</p>
      <p>For some diehard pageant fans, Michelle seems to have been destined for queendom. How does she feel about the overwhelmingly positive forecasts?</p>
      <p>She admits, “I’ve always believed that if something is meant for you, it will be given to you in God’s perfect time. I’m very pleased that since winning the MWP coronation, international polls have been ranking me within the top 10, so that’s definitely an added confidence booster. I trust my team and I believe we have a very good chance this year.”</p>
      <p>As part of her Miss World journey, Michelle plans to make giant steps in advancing her autism advocacy.</p>
      <p>She discloses, “Currently, my focus is on autism awareness and the work I’ve been doing with Autism Society Philippines. We’ve been working together closely in making the Philippines an ‘autism-OK’ nation through various activities that highlight inclusivity, activities that give individuals on the spectrum a sense of purpose, and are also in communication with major brands and establishments that we will be working together with for a very special campaign.”</p>
      <p>Ensuring Michelle’s winning looks are some of the country’s top stylemeisters.</p>
      <p>Michelle says, “Francis Libiran is making my final gown and national costume. I’m also grateful because countless designers have also contributed to my wardrobe for the pre-pageant activities, like Renee Salud, Nono Palmos, Chris Nick, Jojo Bragais, and many more. It’s humbling how an entire country comes together with a unified goal to support one girl as part of its quest for national pride.”</p>
      <p>Despite being touted as one of the early favorites, Michelle still needs to step up her social media performance.</p>
      <p>“We have the Multimedia Fast Track Challenge where online voting comes in. There’s a large gap between me and some other countries, so the Philippines really needs to step up in terms of voting through MobStar, which is the official app of Miss World,” she reveals.</p>
      <p>Miss World Philippines National Director Arnold Vegafria is confident that Michelle will be a clear standout among this year’s contenders. He says, “Her Filipina looks, plus her experience as an actress and model are definitely a big plus, and I think her heart is in the right place when it comes to her personal advocacy. Of course, there’s a lot of pressure living up to her family’s legacy, but let’s just hope she does her best.”</p>
      <p>Set to leave for London on November 19, Michelle will be accompanied by her family, handlers from MWP and GMA-7, some friends and her training team.</p>
      <p>The Miss World 2019 pageant will be telecast live via satellite via GMA-7 on December 14, Saturday, 10:00 p.m.</p>
