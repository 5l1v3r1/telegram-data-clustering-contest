      <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla. -- A few changes are coming to the Yacht Club beach. After being closed for a year, the club will demolish the Yacht Club Pavilion.</p>
      <p>The structure, which was constructed in the 1960s, is in disrepair and requires significant renovations to bring it into compliance with todayâ€™s regulations. The building has been closed for the past year due to these concerns.</p>
      <p>The beach will be closed for safety reasons, but the Yacht Club amenities will stay open.</p>
      <p>The demolition, which will cost $15,000, is funded by the Yacht Club Fund, not the Parks Go Bond fund.</p>
      <p>The pavilion demolition will start November 18th. The beach is expected to reopen on Saturday, November 23rd.</p>
