      <p>There have been relentless battles in Tripoli between the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and forces loyal to the Government of National Accord (GNA) headed by Fayez al-Sarraj.<br/><br/>Spokesman for Volcano of Rage Operation (VRO) launched by Sarraj’s forces announced that it arrested three LNA members and seized their vehicles after besieging them in Wadi Rabie, south of the capital.<br/><br/>The VRO accused the LNA of launching random projectiles on Salaheddin Thursday morning. One projectile killed a citizen and wounded his family members.<br/><br/>The operation added that the air support provided to the army on Wednesday targeted a house in Ain Zara, wounding four people who were transported to hospital for treatment.<br/><br/>Earlier, the VRO announced that LNA remnants attempted to sneak into the coastal road and killed three family members who were riding a car. However, the LNA refuted the accusations, saying the militias were forcing the capital’s residents to evict their houses.<br/><br/>LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mesmari reiterated demands that the international community acknowledge the conspiracy against the LNA through the Security Council’s decision to impose a ban on exporting arms to the army although it is fighting terrorist groups.<br/><br/>In a press conference held in Benghazi on Thursday, Mesmari stated that the battle waged by the army would not stop until disarming the militias.<br/><br/>Mesmari expressed the willingness of the army to cooperate with European countries to prevent illegal migration and terrorism.<br/><br/>These developments coincided with a visit by a GNA delegation to the US upon the invitation of the US government.<br/><br/>The delegation held talks with several officials at the US Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, National Security Council, United States Agency for International Development and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
