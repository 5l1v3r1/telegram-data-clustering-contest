      <p>Cape Town - The highly anticipated third series of big budget period drama <i>The Crown</i> arrives on Netflix on Sunday, 17 November.</p>
      <p>The new season sees a new guard sweep into Downing Street, as Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) and her family struggle to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing Britain.</p>
      <p>From cold-war paranoia, through to the jet-set and the space age - the exuberance of the 1960s and the long hangover of the 1970s - Elizabeth and the royals must adapt to a new, more liberated, but also more turbulent world.</p>
      <p>This video takes a look at the major historic events that will feature in the show, including Queen Elizabeth's silver jubilee, the funeral of Winston Churchill and the investiture of the Prince of Wales and his romantic life.</p>
