      <h3>AGENTS of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency last Monday arrested two known big-time drug dealers in Ilocos-Pangasinan region after they conspired to sell 100 grams of shabu worth P680,000 to an undercover officer in Ilocos Sur.</h3>
      <p>PDEA chair, Director General Aaron N. Aquino, identified the two as Jimyr Beninsig and Xandrex Albay, both ‘high-value targets’ operating in Ilocos Sur and nearby areas.</p>
      <p>According to the official, the two were arrested by a combined team from the PDEA Regional Office 1 and the local police along McArthur Highway in Barangay Del Pilar, Tagudin, Ilocos Sur.</p>
      <p>Recovered from their possession were 14 pieces of heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing the prohibited drugs, several drug paraphernalia, P46,300 in various denominations and the marked money they received from an undercover officer.</p>
      <p>Both have been charged for violation of Section 5 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs), and Section 11 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs), Article II of Republic Act 9165, or The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 which is a non-bailable offense that could send them to life in jail with a P10 million penalty upon conviction, said Aquino.</p>
