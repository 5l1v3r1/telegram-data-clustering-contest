      <p>The base model <a href="https://wccftech.com/16-inch-macbook-pro-official-specs-features-pricing-colors-availability/">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> is actually excellent value for money when you compare it directly with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/16-inch-macbook-pro-vs-15-inch-macbook-pro-specs-features-design-price-comparison/">15-inch model</a> which has now been discontinued by Apple. You get a brand new keyboard that has more key travel and definitely doesn't suck while offering 512GB of storage instead of 256GB. And of course, the real star of the show is that 16-inch Retina display coupled with amazing sounding speakers and a mic that is ready to record your next podcast. In fact, some even swear that the built-in mic is so good that you don't need a USB one at all.</p>
      <p>The new MacBook Pro comes in two finishes - Space Gray and Silver- Â and Amazon says that it will ship the notebook in 1 to 3 weeks. So, if you want to save money on new cutting edge hardware then now's the time to do so. Head over to the link below and place your order. Remember, there are no discount codes or on-page coupons you need to worry about in order to bring the price down.</p>
