      <h1>Take a guess what Kia will be launching next week</h1>
      <h2>All-new Sorento or facelifted Sportage? Kia's teaser leaves us baffled</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/anton-andres.html" target="_blank">Anton Andres</a></address>
      <p>Kia has been on a roll lately. They have the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/2019-kia-stinger-gt-launched-priced-at-php-3-3-million.html">Stinger</a>, the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/kia-ph-launches-2020-seltos-with-php-50k-early-bird-discount.html">Seltos</a>, and most recently, the all-new Optima. You'd think that they'd take a bit of a break given that it's almost the end of the year, but that's just not the case at all. Kia has told reporters that they have another car in store for the world.</p>
      <p>We didn't expect Kia to come out with anything given that they've had a pretty busy year already, but what could they be unveiling next week at the Los Angeles Auto Show?</p>
      <p>We're certain that it won't be the Optima. Why? That's mainly due to the fact the whole world already knows <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/2021-kia-optima-fastback-looks-like-an-absolute-stunner.html">what it looks like</a>, so it would be a little bit pointless if they still kept it shrouded in mystery. It can't be the all-new Rio either since it's still a relatively fresh design, and the Forte was also redesigned recently.</p>
      <p>Our guess? It might be the next-generation Sorento. The current model has been around for quite some time already, first rolling out of assembly lines around the world in 2015. It's also one of the oldest offerings in the current Kia stable. Another reason why we think it's the all-new Sorento is mainly because the Santa Fe has been redesigned and re-engineered from the ground up. Given that it's been over a year since the fourth-generation Santa Fe came out, it's only a matter of time before the Kia came up with a version of their own.</p>
      <p>Another possibility is the future Sportage. Like the Sorento, it's also among the oldest models in the brand's current range. However, Kia hasn't mentioned anything in the pipeline for the Sportage, and Hyundai would typically get the all-new platform first before Kia. Hyundai also previewed the Vision T concept, which hints at a totally new Tucson in about a year or two. The Carnival (or Sedona, depending on the market) is likely too, but there hasn't been much buzz about it.</p>
      <p>Of course, Kia could just shock us all with a totally different car none of us would have predicted. A two-door version of the Stinger would sound nice, but we're not really counting on that. Still, anything is possible though.</p>
      <p>So, what's your guess? Chime in on the comments below.</p>
