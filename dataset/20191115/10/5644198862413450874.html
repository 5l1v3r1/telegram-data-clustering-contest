      <p>Global equities markets rose and safe-haven assets such as gold and government debt fell on Friday on renewed hopes that the United States and China will reach a deal to de-escalate their trade war helped boost risk appetite.</p>
      <p>NEW YORK: Global equities markets rose and safe-haven assets such as gold and government debt fell on Friday on renewed hopes that the United States and China will reach a deal to de-escalate their trade war helped boost risk appetite.</p>
      <p>The three major U.S. stock indexes opened higher and set fresh record highs while equity markets from Tokyo to the major bourses in Europe and across the Americas gained on remarks by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Kudlow cited what he called very constructive talks with Beijing about ending a 16-month trade war during an event at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.</p>
      <p>"We're getting close," Kudlow said.</p>
      <p>Progress was being made on an agreement's details, according to U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who said the trade talks are set to continue with a telephone call on Friday as both sides seek to hammer out a "phase one" pact.</p>
      <p>MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.51per cent, with its emerging markets index rising 0.66per cent. In Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 0.26per cent and the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares adding 0.19per cent.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, the three major indices hit record highs.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 106.48 points, or 0.38per cent, to 27,888.44. The S&amp;P 500 gained 11.64 points, or 0.38per cent, to 3,108.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.89 points, or 0.48per cent, to 8,519.91.</p>
      <p>"The market rally has largely been driven by the positive sentiment around the trade talks, obviously," said Rahul Shah, chief executive of Ideal Asset Management in New York.</p>
      <p>The fourth quarter, which tends to be the best period for corporate earnings, will likely be supportive of stocks going forward, but poor macroeconomic data or a political event could trigger a downturn, Shah said.</p>
      <p>"Since the market is hitting all-time highs and everybody's comfortable, the risk of an event affecting the market negatively is higher now because the market is an elevated level," he said.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 has gained almost 25per cent year to date, and forward earnings for the benchmark index are at 18 times.</p>
      <p>Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were higher, with the trade-sensitive technology sector rising the most with a 0.59per cent gain.</p>
      <p>Gold prices and government debt prices fell as investors leaned away from safe-haven assets on fresh hopes the United States and China will de-escalate trade tensions.</p>
      <p>Spot gold dropped 0.2per cent to US$1,468.38 an ounce while benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 2/32 in price to push yields up to 1.8221per cent.</p>
      <p>Germany's 10-year Bund yield traded at -0.344per cent.</p>
      <p>Oil prices rose on signs of progress in the U.S.-China trade talks, offsetting concerns about rising supplies next year.</p>
      <p>Benchmark Brent crude gained 37 cents to US$62.65 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate crude rose 45 cents to US$57.22 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The Japanese yen and Swiss franc, both beneficiaries of a flight to quality, weakened.</p>
      <p>The dollar index fell 0.18per cent, with the euro up 0.26per cent to US$1.105. The Japanese yen weakened 0.28per cent versus the greenback at 108.74 per dollar.</p>
