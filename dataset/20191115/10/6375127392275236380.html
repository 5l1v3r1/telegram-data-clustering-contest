      <h3>BETONG Sumaya is having butterflies in his stomach these days. “Yes, sobrang kabado ako, nape-pressure habang papalapit na ang first concert ko sa Music Museum on Thursday, November 21, which is my birthday,” he says. “Two years ago pa, may nag-offer na sa’king mag-concert, including GMA. Pero sabi ko, maawa po kayo, walang biruan. So pinag-isipan ko muna kung kaya ko ba talaga mag-concert and, after two years nga, heto na, timing naman sa birthday ko at pumirma ako ng recording contract sa GMA Music.”</h3>
      <p>Betong says singing is really one of his passions. “My mother is a singer. There was a time na tinalo niya si Nora Aunor in a singing contest sa Villamor Air Base. Ako rin, first placer ako sa amateur contest in high school and in college sa PUP, nanalo rin ako. I also won sa isang pa-contest ng SM.”</p>
      <p>But after college, he was hired by Cheche Lazaro as production assistant in Probe Team in 1996 and that started his broadcasting career. He first tried hosting as a co-host of Susan Enriquez in “Kay Susan Tayo”, then he branched out into acting as a comedian in “Bubble Gang” and in soaps like “Genesis”, “I Heart Davao”, “Inday Will Always Love You” and he’s now part of Alden Richards’ primetime soap, “The Gift”. He also won in “Survivor Philippines” in 2011.</p>
      <p>The title of his concert is “Betong’s Amazing Concert: Try Ko Lang Ha?”, produced by Michael Angelo Lobrin and directed by Paul Infante. Will he be supported by his co-stars in “Bubble Gang” and “The Gift”?</p>
      <p>“Oh yes. I’m really overwhelmed by their support. So far, 16 na ang confirmed na guests ko, led by Dingdong Dantes, Alden Richards, Michael V, Maey Bautista, Jeric Gonzales, Patricia Javier, Miguel Tanfelix, members ng ‘The Clash 1’, at iba pa. Marami pang nagbo-volunteer, kaya lang kung lahat, isasali ko, baka sumobrang haba ng concert at abutin na kami ng ‘Unang Hirit’, e a-appear din sa show ang mga kasama ko roon led by Igan, Arnold Clavio. I will do duets with many of them, and production numbers na may kasamang dancing. We are now rehearsing and I’m so excited. We promise to give the audience a great show.”</p>
      <p>We heard that the sale of his tickets is very fast. “Yung VVIP seats daw, sold out na. Pero marami pang available sa sides kaya bumili na po kayo." Tickets range from only P900 to P2,900 and you can get them sa Ticketworld at 891-9999. Looks like his concert has all the makings of a big hit that he should now prepare for a repeat. “May title na nga ako,” he beams. “Betong’s Amazing Concert: Try Ko lang Uli Ha!”</p>
