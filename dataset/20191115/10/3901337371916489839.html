      <p>Bafana Bafana head coach, Molefi Ntseki explained why Bafana Bafana struggled in front of goal against Ghana. </p>
      <p>The South African national team had a disappointing start to their Africa Cup Of Nations qualifying campaign, after a 2-0 loss to Ghana in the Cape Coast.</p>

      <p>Despite having ammunition in Bradley Grobler, Percy Tau, Lebo Mothiba, Kermit Erasmus and Thembinkosi Lorch, Bafana struggled to find the back of the net.</p>
      <p>“The two teams were very compact, if you look at Ghana, they didn’t have too many shots on goal, except for the goal from Thomas and the second goal came from a transition, winning the ball when we were open at the back. They had possession in our half but they never hurt us, so if it comes to the two teams, the game of football has become so compact, the defence has been so organized, so it is becoming a bit of a problem,” Ntseki told the media after the game. </p>
      <p>“But in situations where you have reinforced defence, there are too many tactical strategies to apply. We tried to overload the wings and tried to come out from crosses, we couldn’t get inside the box. </p>
      <p>“If you look at the performance of the players, we can’t say that the tactics didn’t work out but also give respect to the team with how they defended against us,” he added. </p>
