      <h3>JANELLA Salvador is lucky to be back in circulation after her doomed love affair with Elmo Magalona. At least, she’s able to make a comeback in the primetime soap “Killer Bride” that is extended until January and now, her new movie, “The Heiress”, directed by Frasco Mortiz and where she plays the title role no less, is about to be shown on November 27. Why is the title of her movie “The Heiress”?</h3>
      <p>“It’s a horror movie about a mambabarang, an evil sorceress who uses voodoo dolls to put a deadly spell on someone that can cause a lot of harm, even death,” she says. “In the story, I’m Guia and I was raised by my Aunt Luna played by Ms. Maricel Soriano, kasi my own mother, Sunshine Cruz as Carmen, works as an OFW. I didn’t know that Aunt Luna is a sorceress controlled by a demonic spirit, Mamalarang. She is grooming me to be her heiress, who will inherit all her evil powers. When my mother comes home, she’ll do everything para hindi ako mapalapit sa mother ko as she wants to control me. When I had a boyfriend, McCoy de Leon as Renz, gagawin din niya ang lahat para ilayo ako rito.”</p>
      <p>“The Heiress” is written by Gina Marissa Tagasa and directed by Frasco Mortiz, who earlier did the hit horror Kathniel film, “Pagpag”. We ask Janella how is it working with Maricel Soriano. “At first, sobrang na-star struck ako sa kanya,” she confesses. “Kasi alam naman natin ang kalibre ng isang Maricel Soriano, di ba? So intimidated ako, but she turned out to be so nice, so naging comfortable ako agad sa kanya. She really guided me in our scenes together. Inalalayan niya ako kaya I’m really grateful to her for all her help while we’re doing this movie.”</p>
      <p>How about Direk Frasco Mortiz? “First time ko rin to work with him at hindi ka maiilang sa kanya kasi he’s approachable. He explains to me in detail what he wants to achieve in each scene and what he wants me to do. Happy set kami kasi, lahat, very professional.”</p>
      <p>Didn’t she get scared with the evil apparition that is Mamalarang? “Actually, nakakatakot talaga ang hitsura niya as you can see in our trailer, and I was really scared of her. Kahit nasa bahay na ako, nai-imagine ko pa rin siya. Malalarang is really more deadly than any mambabarang and you will discover her powers when you see ‘The Heiress’.”</p>
      <p>After Elmo, Janella is now being linked to Fil-Brit actor Markus Paterson. They’re always seen together and it’s obvious something sweet is brewing between them but both Janella and Markus won’t officially admit that they are on.</p>
      <p>It seems Janella has been burned after she became so open with her relationship with Elmo before. She now says: “Based on my experience in my last relationship, it doesn't do me any good na you're in a relationship with someone, pero ang feeling mo, you're in a relationship with the whole world.”</p>
