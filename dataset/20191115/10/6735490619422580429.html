      <p>Middleton said in a speech, “You have created here at the Nook a nurturing, caring environment that allows families who are going through the unimaginable the ability to spend precious quality time with each other, comforted in the knowledge that their children are being looked after in the best possible way.”</p>

      <p>Middleton shared, “EACH was one of the very first charities that I decided to become patron of after my marriage. Whilst a lot has changed since then, my commitment and support for this wonderful organization and the work that you do has not.</p>
      <p>“Over the years, I have seen first-hand the depth of EACH’s reputation as a standard-bearer in children’s hospice care, both here in the U.K. and internationally too, during my visits to Malaysia and Australia.</p>
      <p>“Your hugely dedicated and talented team are at the core of this success.</p>
      <p>“The Nook Hospice is a fitting tribute to all your staff, its generous supporters and its awe-inspiring children and families who I have been so lucky to meet here today. I, therefore, could not be more delighted to invite my army of little helpers to join me in officially opening this new hospice.”</p>
