      <h2>Former Red Devils striker Louis Saha said that the Dutch striker's appetite for goals made things difficult for the younger members of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad</h2>

      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was once reduced to tears by Ruud van Nistelrooy during his time at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , former Red Devils striker Louis Saha has revealed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> star Ronaldo joined United as teenager from Sporting Lisbon in 2003, while the Dutch striker was one of the main men in Sir Alex Ferguson's team.</p>
      <p>The pair, who were later briefly reunited in Spain at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , played together at Old Trafford until Van Nistelrooy left the club in 2006 after scoring 150 goals in 219 games.</p>
      <p>However, in an interview with <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/ruud-van-nistelrooy-cristiano-ronaldo-cry-louis-saha-man-utd-news-training">FourFourTwo</a> , Saha indicated that the two players didn't always see eye-to-eye and that the striker's desire to score goals made things difficult for the younger members of Fergie's squad.</p>
      <p>And Saha claimed that a disagreement between the pair shortly after the death of Ronaldo's father (in 2005) left the Portugal international crying.</p>

      <p>“Ruud had that kind of ego: he wanted all the passes," the former France international said.</p>
      <p>"And sometimes, for the development of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and Wayne Rooney, it was difficult for the manager to deal with.</p>
      <p>“Did Ruud make Ronaldo cry? Yeah, there were stories because I think they ended up in an argument at the moment when Cristiano’s father had passed away, so it wasn’t the right moment.</p>
      <p>"Things like that happen when two players have lots of spirit, but I’m sure Ruud regrets some of his words."</p>

      <p>Before leaving United for Real Madrid in 2009, Ronaldo scored 118 goals in 292 appearances and helped the Red Devils to three Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy.</p>
      <p>Portugal's all-time record goalscorer also enjoyed nine successful seasons in La Liga before making the move to Italy.</p>
      <p>He has also won the FIFA Ballon d'Or five times, and Saha was full of praise for the forward's commitment to becoming one of the world's best.</p>

      <p>“Cristiano was just an animal," he recalled. "I don’t know if you can say that he was a human! You could see from when he was 18 or 19 that this guy was not normal.</p>
      <p>“These players who have all the ability recognise that it’s also about working harder than anyone – not just talent.</p>
      <p>"The top seeds in tennis don’t hit the ball better or have better technique; no, they work harder than anyone, and Cristiano did that.”</p>
