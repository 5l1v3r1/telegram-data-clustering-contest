      <h1>Barcelona identify three replacements for Ivan Rakitic</h1>

      <h3>Ivan Rakitic looks likely to depart the Camp Nou in 2020, so Barcelona have already looked at potential replacements for the Croatian.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic has revealed his unhappiness at the Camp Nou after frequently being left out of the squad in the 2019/20 campaign. Frenkie de Jong’s arrival has taken a detrimental impact on the Croatia international’s playing time and an exit for him seems inevitable, with talks suggesting that it could take place in January itself.</p>
      <p>Serie A trio of AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus is interested in the former Sevilla midfielder and the top two title challengers are favourites to land him. While Antonio Conte is looking to add a creative midfielder to his roster, the defending Italian champions want Rakitic for his experience and to help them win the Champions League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://en.as.com/en/2019/11/13/football/1573633816_682153.html"><b>AS has claimed</b></a> that the Catalans have now started scouting replacements for Ivan Rakitic. Initially it was thought that Frenkie de Jong would be taking over the Croatian’s reigns, but the Dutchman is being conditioned to be a direct replacement to Sergio Busquets and hence, the Blaugrana will turn to external sources in the upcoming year.</p>
      <p>Napoli superstar Fabian Ruiz tops the three man shortlist made by Ernesto Valverde’s side, but the Spaniard is in demand and wanted by arch rivals Real Madrid as well, given his reasonable value of 60 million euros. Ruiz was a former Real Betis player and since the Andalusians played similarly to Barca, he could succeed at the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>Juventus midfielder and Uruguay international Rodrigo Bentancur is another player who is wanted by the La Liga giants. Bentancur has fallen out of favour and down the pecking order under Maurizio Sarri, so the Turin-based giants are ready to get rid of him for 35 million euros. In case Bentancur signs, Barca may have a replacement for Busquets and de Jong could play in an advanced role.</p>
      <p>Finally, Atletico Madrid superstar Saul Niguez is the final name on the Blaugrana’s wish-list. The Spain international was previously wanted by Manchester City as well, but nothing fell through and good performances on a consistent level meant that his stock in the market increased. Saul is the most expensive option on Barca’s radar.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde’s side had also considered the possibility of promoting one of their La Masia stars to the first team given the promising likes of Riqui Puig and Alex Collado who have emerged recently into the fray. However, they are not too similar to Rakitic and thus would not be considered unless Barca’s transfers fail.</p>
      <p>Who do you think is the best replacement for Rakitic at Barcelona?</p>
