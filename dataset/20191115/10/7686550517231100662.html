      <p>Rehearsals are in full swing and the cast, led by Dreams Come True princess Nicole Seabright and comedy genius actor Adam Byard, are busy practising scripts, songs and choreography.</p>
      <p>Adam Byard from Pontipridd exclaimed, "This year is definitely not one to miss. The sketches and gags this year are brilliant and we are all having a lot of fun in rehearsals!”</p>
      <p>The dynamic duo playing Cinderella and JJ Buttons will be joined by Jordan Bateman and Ryan Edmunds as the frightfully funny stepsisters, Lewis Brimfield as Prince Charming, and Bethan Searle taking the reins as the magical Fairy Godmother.</p>
      <p>Mark Jermin, of Jermin Productions, said, "We are super excited for this year’s production. Cinderella is the most magical of all the shows and we’ve really revamped the script and characters to ensure its very colloquial to the areas we visit."</p>
      <p>Fellow creative on the show and sister to Mark, Nia Jermin, commented, “The audience of each performance are literally the heart of the pantomime, so we’ve tried to include as many local references as possible and ensure there is something for everyone from unicorns, to Brexit, to Love Island to Kevin the carrot... It’s all in!”</p>

      <p>The pair are no strangers to the stage and limelight and have had quite the year. Mark is director of The Mark Jermin Stage School as well as a theatrical agent to many of the UK’s leading actors and actresses via Mark Jermin Management, many of whom will be on screen during the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>Mark added, “The lead up to Christmas is always a really busy time of year, with the filming of the infamous Christmas commercials and Christmas television specials. It’s great to celebrate what everyone has achieved throughout the year."</p>
      <p>Nia will also be doubling her time as pantomime maker, as well as treading the boards in the West End production of Curtains The Musical alongside Jason Manford. Both Mark and her worked on this year’s Swansea Pride Events, and it was Nia’s role on the Swansea Pride committee that won her a 'Women In Business' award in October for Champion for Change for the LGBT+ community in south Wales.</p>
      <p>Nia, who will be at the Wyndhams Theatre London in the 'Whodunnit' Kander and Ebb production from December 13, continued, “I’m delighted to be returning to the West End this December. But at the moment, the pantomime is taking priority!”</p>
