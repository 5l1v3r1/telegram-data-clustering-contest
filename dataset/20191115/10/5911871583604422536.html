      <p>We’re nearing the release of <i>Romance</i>, Camila Cabello’s second album. If the album feels like it’s already halfway here, it’s because the former Fifth Harmony member has released quite a few of the album’s songs ahead of its 12/6 drop date: “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2057189/camila-cabello-shameless-liar-romance/video/">Shameless</a>,” “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2058097/camila-cabello-liar-video-russian-doll/video/">Liar</a>,” “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2060400/camila-cabello-cry-for-me/music/">Cry For Me</a>,” “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2061132/camila-cabello-easy/music/">Easy</a>,” and her #1 duet with boyfriend Shawn Mendes, “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2048619/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-senorita/video/">Señorita</a>.” Today she shares a whopping sixth advance track.</p>
      <p>The latest Cabello single, “Living Proof,” was written with Justin Tranter and Alexandra Tamposi and produced by Mattman &amp; Robin. Like the rest of them, it presents an appealing version of modern pop, sleek and catchy but with a few odd flourishes. In this case that means constant handclaps in the background that keep you feeling off-balance and a twisted intro that, no shit, reminds me of Animal Collective’s “Who Could Win A Rabbit.” Don’t get your hopes up for anything <i>too</i> weird, though. More than anything, “Living Proof” reminds me of former Cabello tourmate Taylor Swift, but with a lot more falsetto theatrics. “Show me your demons,” Cabello sings, “and I might show you mine, one at a time.”</p>
      <p>Hear it below, where you can also find Cabello’s newly announced tour dates. A Mastercard presale goes live today at 10AM local time, and general onsale begins 11/21 at noon local time.</p>
