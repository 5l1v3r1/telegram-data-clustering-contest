        <b>HMRC has refuted claims it miscalculated a tax demand which was a major factor in the financial collapse of Rangers in 2012.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tax authority issued a blunt response to a report which claimed its "multi-million-pound blunder" was being blamed for the oldco club being consigned to liquidation in June 2012.</p>
      <p>In a brief statement on its press office Twitter account, HMRC said: "As widely reported today and to clarify: HMRC won against Rangers' tax avoidance in the Supreme Court, and did not miscalculate anything."</p>
      <p>The report stemmed from a June audit by liquidators BDO, who wiped £26m off the amount claimed by HMRC after challenging the imposition of a £24m penalty for the use of an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) scheme through which the club paid wages and bonuses which were disguised as loans.</p>
      <p>The reduction left the total outstanding to HMRC as £68m <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11788/11861448/rangers-tax-case-bdo-continue-negotiations-with-hmrc-over-size-of-ebt-tax-bill">and there were claims on Thursday that the figure could drop by a total of £50m.</a> This led to former Rangers chairman John McLelland arguing there would have been more potential buyers for the club had demands been reduced at the time.</p>

      <p>With the EBT case hanging over the club, Rangers were sold to Craig Whyte for £1 in May 2011 on the understanding he paid off their £18m bank debt and another tax bill of less than £3m.</p>
      <p>He mortgaged season ticket sales to pay the bank and the club went into administration in February 2012 over a separate tax debt relating to unpaid PAYE and national insurance.</p>
      <p>HMRC went on to win a legal challenge against the liquidated Rangers (now called RFC 2012 plc) over their use of EBTs, a test case which has allowed it to issue demands over the use of many other similar schemes.</p>
      <p>The tax authority would have had to instigate fresh legal action to enforce the £24m penalties, but with little money in the pot for creditors, it did not challenge BDO's assertion.</p>
