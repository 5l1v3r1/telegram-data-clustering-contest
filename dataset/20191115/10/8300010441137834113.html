      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Former Vice President and presidential candidate Joe Biden visited Los Angeles Trade-Technical College for a campaign stop and addressed the <a href="https://abc7.com/teen-shoots-5-students-self-at-high-school-in-santa-clarita/5696998/">deadly shooting at Saugus High School</a> in Santa Clarita.<br/><br/>Biden spoke about the shooting, vowing to beat the National Rifle Association if elected.<br/><br/>"I'm so tired of people talking about your prayers. Dammit, we have to protect these kids," Biden told the crowd. "We have to do it now.''<br/><br/>"If I'm your president I guarantee you I'm going to beat these guys. I guarantee you," he added.<br/><br/>He was at the school for what was supposed to be a speech on community college and jobs. The shooting prompted a change in the program.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Northern California, current Vice President Mike Pence promised President Donald Trump is committed to ending school shootings.<br/><br/>"This president and this administration will remain resolved to bring the scourge of mass shootings to an end," Pence said.<br/><br/>In Washington, it was Republicans in the Senate who blocked a bill that would require background checks on all gun purchases as the shooting was still unfolding.<br/><br/>Other politicians, including presidential candidates, came out with statements addressing the shooting.<br/><br/>Former Rep. Katie Hill told Eyewitness News that she and several family members went to Saugus High School, and said many students there volunteered for her campaign last year.</p>
