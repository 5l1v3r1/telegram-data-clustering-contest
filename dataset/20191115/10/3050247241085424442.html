      <h1>Paypal’s Pornhub Snub Pumps Verge (XVG) by 33% on 168% Volume Surge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:38:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Verge (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/verge">XVG</a>) has seen a 33% pump in the 24 hours following Paypal’s move to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-fixes-this-paypal-cuts-payouts-to-over-100-000-pornhub-models">pull the plug</a> on the adult entertainment website Pornhub.</p>
      <p>XVG — whose creators struck a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pornhub-starts-accepting-verge-as-payment-calls-the-move-critical-for-crypto-adoption">deal</a> with Pornub back in April 2018 — has skyrocketed in value since the PayPal news broke on Nov. 14, as Coin360 data <a href="https://coin360.com/coin/verge-xvg">shows</a>.</p>

      <h3>168% increase in 24h trade volume</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/verge">XVG</a> network uses anonymity-focused networks such as Tor and I2P, as well as additional layers of encryption to bolster security. It ranks 66th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization globally and is trading at $0.005086 by press time.</p>
      <p>Trading volumes have soared: as compared with $6,806,206 on Nov. 14, today’s traded volume is at $18,244,214 — a 168% increase.</p>
      <p>According to its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtissilver/2018/12/11/pornhub-2018-year-in-review-insights-report/">2018 Year in Review</a> insights, Pornhub, which claims to be the world’s largest adult entertainment site, reported 4.79 million new videos uploaded from amateurs, models and content partners, feeding into 30.3 billion searches — or 962 a minute.</p>
      <p>When Pornhub first started accepting Verge for payments last April, Pornhub vice president Corey Price argued that “history has proven that the adult entertainment industry plays a critical role in adoption for innovative technology.”</p>
      <h3>Censorship-resistant currency</h3>
      <p>With legacy platforms deserting the project — without stated reason — speculators are evidently counting on the major industry’s predicament strengthening the token’s outlook.</p>
      <p>In August 2018, Pornhub <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pornhub-partners-with-pumapay-to-accept-crypto-as-payments">partnered</a> with cryptocurrency payment and billing startup PumaPay to enable its users to make payments in more <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a> for site subscriptions, including PornHub Premium.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-fixes-this-paypal-cuts-payouts-to-over-100-000-pornhub-models">reported</a> yesterday, PayPal had supported payouts for Pornhub models, some of whom revealed PayPal had in fact independently blacklisted them for years ahead of shuttering its Pornhub services.</p>
