      <p>“I wanted this album to sound like what falling in love feels like, pretty impossible thing to do but I can say I gave it all I had,” Cabello wrote on Twitter earlier this week.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never lived as much life as I did writing this album. It was messy and beautiful, unforgettable and at times so painful I wish I could forget. It was excruciatingly consuming and impossible not to get lost in. It was mine… and now it’s yours. I hope you love it as much as I’ve loved living it.”</p>
      <p>In September, Cabello teased that new music<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/camila-cabello-teases-new-music-2544053"> was on the way in a new video to fans.</a></p>
      <p>“I thought I was making art before,” she continued. “Writing songs was me making art but now I want my life to be a work of art, and my songwriting to be the camera that I take a picture of it with.”</p>
