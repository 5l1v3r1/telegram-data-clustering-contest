      <p>Today (November 15th just in case you were wondering) marks the release of the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/star-wars">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>. In terms of gaming releases, although I haven’t played it myself yet, so far it seems that people are more than a little impressed with the game and particularly its (very unusual these days) total focus on a single-player campaign. I know, hard to believe that an <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/ea">EA</a> release is being well received on launch, right?</p>
      <p>If you were, therefore, planning on giving this a go later, then it’s important (presuming you’re a PC gamer) to have the latest drivers! Well, the good news is that in preparation for the release, <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/amd">AMD</a> has launched the latest Adrenalin 19.11.2 drivers with game-ready optimization for the latest Star Wars release.</p>

      <h3>AMD Radeon Adrenalin 2019 19.11.2</h3>
      <p>So, what do the latest drivers do? Well, in a nutshell, they provide optimization for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Yep, that’s pretty much about it. The official update notes read as follows:</p>

      <h3>Where Can I Get Them?</h3>
      <p>As always, if you have the AMD Adrenalin app already installed on your PC, a quick check should prompt you to download the latest version. A relatively important factor if you are planning on playing some Star Wars later and want it to run as well as possible with your AMD GPU.</p>
      <p>If, however, it’s not prompting you to update to 19.11.2, then you download the latest drivers (and learn more about them) <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-19-11-2">via the link here!</a></p>
