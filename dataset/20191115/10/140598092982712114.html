      <h1>Bezos strikes back against Trump as Amazon appeal JEDI 'war-cloud' contract snub</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:31:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tom-hoggins/" target="_blank">Tom Hoggins</a></address>
      <p>Amazon has said it will appeal the Trump administration’s award of a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/10/26/microsoft-defeats-amazon-bitter-battle-10bn-pentagon-cloud-contract/">$10bn (£7.7bn) cloud computing contract</a> to its closest rival Microsoft due to "unmistakable bias".</p>
      <p>The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known as JEDI, is a US Department of Defense’s contract that is set to modernise the division’s disparate cloud infrastructure. </p>
      <p>It was initially believed that the contract was "gift-wrapped" for Amazon Web Services, the dominant leader in the cloud computing market. But in October, the DoD made the surprising decision to award the contract to Microsoft.</p>
      <p>This was following President Donald Trump’s vow to “take a very strong look” at the bidding process in July after “tremendous complaints from other companies”. The process was subsequently paused the following month.</p>
      <p>The decision to award the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/10/28/should-surprise-no-one-amazon-lost-10bn-jedi-war-cloud-contract/">JEDI contract</a> to Amazon’s closest rival lead to accusations that Trump’s open feud with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was the main reason for the company being snubbed. A speechwriter for former Defense secretary General John Mattis alleges that Trump personally asked Mattis to "screw Amazon" out of the contract.</p>
      <p>“AWS [Amazon’s cloud computing service] is uniquely experienced and qualified to provide the critical technology the US military needs, and remains committed to supporting the Department of Defence’s modernisation efforts,” AWS said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“We also believe it's critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that is free from political influence. Numerous aspects of the Jedi evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias – and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.”</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.federaltimes.com/it-networks/cloud/2019/11/14/amazon-will-protest-pentagons-jedi-to-dod/">The Federal Times</a>, AWS boss <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/30/king-cloud-andy-jassy-rock-fan-behind-amazons-profitable-business/">Andy Jassy</a> was videoed at an Amazon meeting saying he wanted to "shine a light" on the process.</p>
      <p>“I think when you have a sitting president who’s willing to publicly show his disdain for a company and the leader of a company, it’s very difficult for government agencies including the DoD to make an objective decision without fear of reprisal,” Jassy said.</p>
      <p>Bezos has frequently been the target of President Trump’s ire, calling the Bezos-owned Washington Post as "fake news" and saying that Amazon is on an "uneven playing field".</p>
      <p>US defense secretary Mark Esper – who recused himself from the JEDI process in – has rejected any suggestions of bias in the awardance of the contract.</p>
      <p>“I am confident it was conducted freely and fairly, without any type of outside influence,” Esper told a press conference in Seoul, South Korea.</p>
