      <h1>A singer named Kiel Alo</h1>

      <h3>WE had dinner with Showbuzz host and friend Jobert Sucaldito and had a nice long chat with his talent Kiel Alo fresh from his solo concert 'Ako Naman' at the Music Museum.          </h3>
      <p>Produced by Sucaldito, it was a pre-birthday event for Kiel who was born November 8. Every segment was well thought of with every guest performer (except for one who walked out after banging her head against the wall and all because she didn't like the line of questioning made by ABS CBN news reporter Mario Dumawal regarding family issues). What lurks in her unstable mind in the first place? To upstage the Barretto sisters? All throughout Kiel remained calm and a gentleman. After a day or two the overrated singer apologized not verbally though to the aggrieved parties and we hope it was done with sincerity) in full support for "hugot king" Kiel.</p>
      <p>Just like any aspiring singers ay maraming pagsubok na dinanas si Kiel who has a college degree majoring in Marketing. He started as a member of the boyband Fresh Myx. A former manager brought him to Viva and appeared in bit roles. He also worked as marketing specialist sellling condo units.</p>
      <p>In one event, narinig siyang kumanta ng Showbuzz host na si Jobert at dito nabuo ang talent manager-talent relationship. He did gigs at Music Hall and Music Box and provincial shows na kung saan nahasa siya nang husto bilang singer. He also auditioned for Idol Philippines but didn't pass. We find this absurd dahil twice naming narinig umawit si Kiel and we were impressed with the quality of his voice.</p>
      <p>The months ahead will be a busy one for Kiel. He flies to Kuwait end of the month as guest in a show for OFWs. Bacolod City waits for him for a charity show. He stars as Crisostomo Ibarra in the musical, Kanser which will be staged at GSIS Theater.</p>
      <p>His goal is no different from other dreamers: to become an established balladeer. And create an identity completely his own. As Jobert always reminds him: ‘Learn the song but never copy the singer'.</p>
