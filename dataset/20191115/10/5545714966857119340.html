      <h1>DokeV is an oddball 'family-friendly' MMO from the makers of Black Desert</h1>
      <h2>I'm weirdly curious</h2>

      <p>Sometimes a video game comes our way and I just want to tell you to watch the trailer because there's a whole lot going on and it's better seen than explained. That's definitely how I feel about <a href="https://dokev.pearlabyss.com/en/Main/Index"><i>DokeV</i></a>, a wild new PC and console MMO for "all ages" from Pearl Abyss, the <i>Black Desert Online </i>people.</p>
      <p>It's kinda like <i>Pokémon</i> or <i>Yo-Kai Watch</i>, but with a staggering visual fidelity to the proceedings.</p>

      <p>The trailer is a trip. The 4K upload made my eyes melt a bit.</p>
      <p>The game is called <i>DokeV</i> – that's "doh-keh-vee," by the way – and it's about creatures, Dokebi, "that grow and gain power from people's dreams." It's running on the studio's next-gen game engine.</p>
      <p>Pearl Abyss is juggling multiple other projects right now (including a new fantasy IP, <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en/Main/Index"><i>Crimson Desert</i></a>, and an arena fighter, <a href="https://shadowarena.pearlabyss.com/en/CBTRegister/Index"><i>Shadow Arena</i></a>), but this is the one I'm most into as a creature-collecting game fan. The developer sums up <i>DokeV</i> as an "open world adventure," and expects to run a beta test in 2020.</p>
