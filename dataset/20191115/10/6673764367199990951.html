      <p><b>FUKUOKA – </b>Hakuho moved into the outright lead at the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament on Friday, defeating Meisei to improve to 5-1.</p>
      <p>In the final bout of Day 6 at Fukuoka Kokusai Center, the Mongolian-born yokozuna easily overpowered the No. 2 maegashira, who came into the match tied for the lead.</p>
      <p>The fight was over almost as quickly as it began, with Hakuho delivering a heavy slap to the face, then yanking Meisei straight down to the clay as he appeared to lose his footing.</p>
      <p>Seven wrestlers started the day tied for the lead, but the pack quickly thinned out as one rank-and-file member after another lost in succession.</p>
      <p>The run of poor results by high-ranking wrestlers continued, with all competing ozeki and sekiwake taking losses.</p>
      <p>Ozeki Takayasu’s nightmare tournament got worse as he dropped to 2-4 with a loss to No. 2 Myogiryu (3-3).</p>
      <p>The maegashira had the stronger position from the opening hit, taking a belt grip and driving out the ozeki for a surprisingly easy victory.</p>
      <p>Ozeki Takakeisho also continued his forgettable opening week at the tournament by dropping to 3-3 with a defeat to No. 4 Tamawashi (4-2).</p>
      <p>In a battle of pusher-thrusters, Takakeisho started strongly as he traded blows with the wily Mongolian veteran. But it was Tamawashi who succeeded in knocking his opponent off his ground, following through with a succession of shoves to win by pushout.</p>
      <p>Moving to within one win of the lead, 34-year-old Tamawashi said he wanted to lift the Emperor’s Cup for the second time in his career.</p>
      <p>“It’s the last tournament of the year and I’d like to win it,” said Tamawashi, who will take on Takayasu on Saturday. “It didn’t start out the way I wanted, but as long as I feel confident about my own sumo, anything is possible.”</p>
      <p>Sekiwake Mitakeumi dropped to 2-4 with his third straight loss, this time against No. 3 Takarafuji. The winner of the Autumn Basho was barely in the bout, easily succumbing to a force out against the maegashira, who improved to 3-3.</p>
      <p>The winner of the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, Asanoyama, relinquished his share of the lead with a loss to fellow komusubi Endo.</p>
      <p>Asanoyama (4-2) took a right-hand inside grip at the jump, but Endo (2-4) countered with an inside left hand, shifting his opponent off-balance and toppling him with a well-executed throw.</p>
      <p>In one of the day’s most anticipated bouts, local favorite No. 8 Shohozan outgunned hugely popular No. 6 Enho to improve to 4-2.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old Fukuoka native opened with a hard charge, but Enho slipped to the side and attempted a force-out. Shohozan held his ground, resisting an attempt by Enho (4-2) to take his legs before pushing the 98-kg dynamo down to the clay from above.</p>
      <p>Among the other overnight leaders, No. 8 Sadanoumi, No. 9 Yutakayama and No. 10 Shodai all dropped to 4-2.</p>
