      <h1>Israel admits 'mistake' in killing Gaza family</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:49:17+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8672/anadolu-agency/" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></address>
      <p><b>JERUSALEM: </b>The Israeli military on Thursday acknowledged that it “made a mistake” in targeting a building in the Gaza City on Wednesday, which led to the killing of eight members of a family.</p>
      <p>Quoting an Israeli army spokesman, the daily <i>Haaretz</i> reported: “The army assessed the building in the Deir al-Balah neighborhood was empty.”</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said the army is investigating the airstrike that took place a few hours before the ceasefire came into effect on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Following the airstrike, the Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee had claimed that the airstrike targeted Rasmi Asoarka, a prominent Islamic Jihad figure.</p>

      <p>The two-day escalation left 34 Palestinians dead — most of them civilians — and hundreds of others injured.</p>
      <p>The military escalation started after Israel assassinated a prominent Islamic Jihad commander Bahaa Abu al-Atta. The Palestinian resistance groups fired hundreds of rockets in response to the Israeli escalation.</p>

        <b>‘Israel attacks damaged over 500 houses’</b>
      </p>
      <p>At least 530 houses in the Gaza Strip were damaged by the recent Israeli aggression on the coastal enclave, Palestine’s Public Works Ministry said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“In Israeli airstrikes against Gaza, 30 houses were completely destroyed and 500 houses were partially damaged,” the ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The estimated value of the damages was about $2 million, according to the ministry.</p>
      <p>It also called on “donors” to provide financial support to reconstruct the damaged houses for the families, who have lost their homes.</p>
      <p>The international community should provide “protection to residential and civilian facilities and handle their responsibilities by intervening urgently to end the imposed siege on the Gaza Strip,” the ministry said.</p>
