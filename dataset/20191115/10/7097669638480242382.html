      <p>Pretoria (AFP) - Therese Walu's eyes welled up as she recalled the last time she shared dinner with her whole family, 19 years ago, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p>The next morning, soldiers raided her village of Mukakira, in the country's northeast -- where a civil war that killed millions raged between 1998-2003.</p>
      <p>She grabbed her youngest daughters and fled into the surrounding forest, not knowing whether the rest of the family survived.</p>
      <p>With nothing but the clothes on her back, Walu started a perilous 10-year journey that would eventually take her more than 3,000 kilometres (1,800 miles), to South Africa's capital Pretoria.</p>
      <p>But like millions of displaced Africans, she reached a country boasting one of the world's most progressive refugee policies only to find herself knocking on closed doors.</p>
      <p>"The only thing they ever gave us is a (temporary) paper of asylum," said Walu, who has been battling for refugee status since 2010.</p>
      <p>Fed up, she joined hundreds of asylum-seekers on October 8 for a long-running sit-in protest in front of the offices of the UN refugee agency UNHCR in Pretoria.</p>
      <p>On Thursday the protesters forced their way into the UNHCR office grounds after being served with a court order evicting them from the street in front of the offices.</p>
      <p>A similar protest was quashed in Cape Town after demonstrators were forcefully evicted from the building last month.</p>
      <p>- High hopes -</p>
      <p>"We are tired, we don't like this South Africa anymore," said Walu, 41, who wants the UNHCR to help relocate her family.</p>
      <p>She told AFP the sit-in -- sparked by a wave of xenophobic violence in September -- was "the only chance" to protest against her situation.</p>
      <p>South Africa is one of the few countries in the world that allows asylum-seekers to work, have access to healthcare and study while their applications are being processed.</p>
      <p>That reputation helped attract more than a million asylum-seekers between 2007 and 2015, one of the world's highest, according to the government.</p>
      <p>With high hopes to begin with, most have faced a lengthy, confusing and increasingly backlogged process.</p>
      <p>"When I first arrived in South Africa I thought 'finally!'," said another Congolese asylum-seeker Esther Kabinga, 46.</p>
      <p>After losing her husband in a plane crash and being gang-raped by soldiers, Kabinga left her home in the southeastern Katanga province in 2011, and walked into neighbouring Zambia with her three small children.</p>
      <p>Kabinga then paid truck drivers to smuggle them to South Africa.</p>
      <p>- Stuck in limbo -</p>
      <p>She recalled having to leave home at 3.30 am to queue up for the processing of her application at the Home Affairs department</p>
      <p>"They give you a number and you wait. At the end of the day they tell you to come back tomorrow, come back next week."</p>
      <p>Like most asylum-seekers, both Kabinga and Walu's initial applications were rejected, marking the start of a lengthy appeal process.</p>
      <p>"Currently there is a 99 percent (initial) rejection rate," human rights lawyer Jessica Lawrence told AFP, adding that thousands were stuck in limbo.</p>
      <p>The UNHCR has also voiced concern about the number of "pending cases".</p>
      <p>Despite the backlog, South Africa has reduced the capacity of some of its refugee application offices.</p>
      <p>Human rights lawyer Sharon Elkambaram lamented the lack of "political will" to process applications.</p>
      <p>"The quality of the decision-making is shocking," she added.</p>
      <p>South Africa processed more than 630,000 applications over the past decade, less than 10 percent of which were granted refugee status.</p>
      <p>Home Affairs spokesman Siya Qoza told AFP the majority were "not genuine cases" that were "clogging the system" by lodging appeals.</p>
      <p>"Why would we need to increase the capacity when most of the world is stable?" he asked. "You would do that if the entire world was at war."</p>
      <p>- 'Just a loser' -</p>
      <p>Walu and Kabinga have been living with temporary asylum permits for almost a decade.</p>
      <p>That paper needs to be renewed every three to six months -- a process that can take up to three weeks.</p>
      <p>Asylum-seekers also say the document brands them as foreigners, making them vulnerable to police bribes and discrimination.</p>
      <p>Walu claims her daughters were given a different high school diploma from a normal refugee because of their asylum-seeking status, and have since been refused access to university.</p>
      <p>"Schools are instructed not to register foreign nationals or anyone who doesn't have a (South African) bar-coded ID," said Elkambaram.</p>
      <p>"Same with hospitals," she added.</p>
      <p>Last month, Johannesburg's High Court granted a public hospital the right to deny dialysis treatment to an Ethiopian asylum-seeker on the basis that she was not a South African citizen.</p>
      <p>Alem Ereselo, 36, feared persecution in Ethiopia after being involved with a once-banned political group as a student.</p>
      <p>She fled to South Africa in 2010 and developed kidney failure in January.</p>
      <p>"I feel shame for South Africa," said Ereselo, almost too frail to speak after spending 14 consecutive days without treatment.</p>
      <p>"After 10 years, being sick shows me that (as an asylum-seeker) you are just a loser."</p>
