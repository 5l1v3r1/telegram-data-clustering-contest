      <p>It's been reported that former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/the-only-way-is-essex/">TOWIE</a> star <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins/">Gemma Collins</a> won't be hitting the charts any time soon.</p>
      <p>The Diva Forever star has apparently pulled out of the race to the Christmas number one after axing plans to release a festive single.</p>
      <p>Gemma had been due to team up with producer Naughty Boy on the track Come Home.</p>

      <p>The song was <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins-to-release-a-heartbreak-ballad-about-arg/">reportedly inspired by her on/off romance</a> with boyfriend James Argent.</p>
      <p>It came about after Gemma met Naughty Boy at the BRIT Awards back in February.</p>

      </p>
      <p>At the time, the producer told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/8692597/gemma-collins-music-james-argent-split-naughty-boy/">The Sun</a> of Gemma's vocal prowess: "She was born to sing."</p>
      <p>He added: "I think Gemma is going to have one of the biggest songs of the year. I can say that with my hand on my heart."</p>

      <p>Now, however, it's been reported that the track has been put on the back burner due to the stars' busy schedules.</p>

      <p>Rumours of Gemma making it as a pop star started to emerge last Christmas, when she appeared on BBC One's All Together Now.</p>
      <p>Gemma wowed viewers with her impressive rendition of Dame Shirley Bassey's Big Spender.</p>

      <p>However, it appears this year fans of the GC will instead have to watch her lace up her skates as she <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/dancing-on-ice/gemma-collins-dancing-on-ice-christmas-special/">returns for the Dancing On Ice Christmas special</a>.</p>
