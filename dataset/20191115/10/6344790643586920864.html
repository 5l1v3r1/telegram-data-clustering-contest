      <h1>Sarah Michelle Gellar Set to Star in Limited Series Drama SOMETIMES I LIE</h1>

      <p><b>Sarah Michelle Gellar</b> (<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, <i>Robot Chicken</i>) is set to star in and executive produce the upcoming limited drama series <b><i>Sometimes I Lie</i></b>, based on the novel by <b>Alice Feeney</b> and adapted by <b>Robin Swicord</b> (<i>Little Women 1994</i>, <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i>, <i>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</i>).</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/sarah-michelle-gellar-sometimes-i-lie-fox-1203403659/">Variety</a> reports this synopsis:</p>
      <blockquote>Amber Reynolds (Gellar) is in a coma. She can’t remember how she got there, but she knows it wasn’t an accident. Terrified and trapped in her own body, she tries to piece together her memories of the last week. With a husband who no longer loves her, a sister hiding a dangerous secret, and an ex-boyfriend who can’t let go of her, Amber knows someone is lying – and that her life is still very much in danger. The show will alternate between the present, a week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from 20 years ago.</blockquote>
      <p>This sounds like a solid story. I’m willing to check it out, and maybe try to catch the book first. This limited series is set for Fox, as is another series that Gellar has signed on to executive produce and star in as well, entitled <i>Other People’s Houses</i>, also an adaptation of a novel by <b>Abbi Waxman</b>.</p>
      <p>How does this story sound to you?</p>
