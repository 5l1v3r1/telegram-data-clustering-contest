      <p>Both Russians were sentenced to prison terms in 2017, facing 10 and 10.5 years of jail time, respectively. However, in October Moscow and Vilnius reportedly managed to agree to an exchange. According to media outlets, Russia was ready to release two Lithuanian nationals, sentenced for espionage in Russia in 2016 in exchange for Filipchenko, however, Russian authorities refused to confirm this information.</p>
