      <h2>The squad returned to work at home on a rainy Thursday</h2>

      <p>Barcelona's squad trained on Thursday after their friendly win over Cartagena the night before.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde worked with those available, a limited selection given the international exodus. Ivan Rakitic did not participate even though he has left the Croatia squad - he has an Achilles problem.</p>
      <p>Birthday boy Samuel Umtiti did appear even though he was not part of the Cartagena expedition. The session took place in rain on a gray Thursday.</p>
      <p>Barca's next game is against Leganes next weekend. Valverde has some puzzles to work out, with Semedo injured and Sergi Roberto suspended. Who will play right back?</p>
