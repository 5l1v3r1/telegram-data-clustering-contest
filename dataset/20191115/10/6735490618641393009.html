      <p>Fans are worried about the fate of the beloved soap opera <a href="https://www.globaltv.com/shows/days-of-our-lives/">“Days Of Our Lives”</a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://tvline.com/2019/11/12/days-of-our-lives-cancelled-cast-fired-season-56/"><i>TV Line</i>,</a> producers of the long-running series have reportedly released the entire cast from their contracts while the soap is set to go on an indefinite hiatus at the end of the month.</p>

      <p>NBC has yet to confirm the news, but the timing seems suspicious as Sony Pictures Television and the network are in negotiations to renew series.</p>
      <p>An insider at Sony told the outlet that “Days” shoots its episodes eight months in advance, meaning the show has enough episodes stockpiled to last until Summer 2020. If it were to be renewed, the series’ production will pick up again in March.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/days-of-our-lives-future-in-doubt-as-entire-cast-released-from-contracts/"><i>The Wrap</i></a> says three of “Days”‘ cast members confirmed that they were released from their contracts. One actor revealed that if the show does resume production in March, the entire cast will receive a sizeable pay cut.</p>
      <p>But while NBC or “Days” producers remain quiet, fans begin to worry:</p>
