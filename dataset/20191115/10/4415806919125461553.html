      <h1>Sinn Féin TD: Party can recover from poor showing at local election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:56:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>A Sinn Féin TD believes there is enough time before the next general election for the party to recover from it's poor showing in the local elections.</p>
      <p>The Party's Ard Fheis is taking place this weekend in Derry.</p>
      <p>A range of issues will be discussed at the gathering which will also see a challenge to the Vice President, Michelle O'Neill.</p>
      <p>Housing Spokesperson, Eoin Ó Broin says they will work to improve the fitness of the party for the campaigns ahead.</p>
      <p>"There could be almost a year between that election and the General Election," he said, adding that the election is "shaping up" to be held between March and May next year.</p>
      <p>Mr Ó Broin added the party has to work hard in every constituency, including his own, to prove "the fitness of the organisation to fight the election".</p>
      <p>Before the General Election, there will be four byelections to fill the seats vacated by those elected to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p>In the vote that will take place at the end of the month, the Sinn Féin candidates are Johnny Mythen (Wexford), Thomas Gould (Cork North-Central), Ann Graves (Fingal) and Mark Ward (Dublin Mid-West).</p>
