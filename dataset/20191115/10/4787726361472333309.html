      <p>Over the last two decades I have been lucky enough to study hundreds of aspiring guitar masters and the number one challenge for almost all of them has been lack of rhythm skills.</p>
      <p>If you could wave a magic wand an become an instant master of rhythm right now, your playing would be almost unrecognisable. And I mean ALL of your playing – soloing, rhythm guitar, finger picking… all of it.</p>
      <aside>Rhythm is probably what holds us back more than anything else</aside>
      <p>Rhythm is probably what holds us back more than anything else... just think about it; rhythm makes up 50% of the musical equation so whatever you are practicing or listening to, at least 50% of it is pure rhythm.</p>
      <p>The great news is that mastering rhythm is easily learned and you can practice it without your guitar.</p>
