      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:17:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:17</time> by <a rel="author">Bloomberg | Upmanyu Trivedi</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/arcelormittal">ArcelorMittal </a>won approval from India’s top court to complete its $5.8 billion purchase of a bankrupt steel mill, clearing the way for tycoon Lakshmi Mittal to enter the world’s second-biggest market.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>allowed Arcelor to make the payment for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/essar-steel">Essar Steel </a>India Ltd. and set aside a bankruptcy appellate tribunal’s order that had given secured and unsecured creditors equal right over the sale proceeds. The lenders’ panel of a bankrupt company has discretion in the distribution of funds in insolvencies, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman said Friday.</p>
      <p>The acquisition of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/essar-steel">Essar Steel </a>India Ltd will make Arcelor the fourth-biggest producer in a nation where the government is investing trillions of rupees in infrastructure. The verdict is likely to be the final approval in a more than yearlong battle by Arcelor to take over Essar. While <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>can seek a review of decision by the same bench of judges, the success of review petitions is rare.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The world’s largest steelmaker, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/arcelormittal">ArcelorMittal </a>and its partner Nippon Steel Corp had offered to pay Rs 420 billion ($5.8 billion) in cash to creditors and pump another Rs 80 billion in the mill last year. While that offer was approved by a bankruptcy tribunal in March under the insolvency process, the payment was kept on hold by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>after a dispute arose between lenders on the distribution of funds.</p>
      <p>The ruling will set a precedent for other insolvencies that are awaiting resolution over the distribution of funds between different class of creditors.</p>
      <p>India’s rupee, and creditors to Essar extended gains after the ruling. The rupee rose 0.3% at 11:06 am, while State Bank of India added 4.2% and Canara Bank surged as much as 7%.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>on Friday also said the timeline for insolvencies can be extended in exceptional cases.</p>
