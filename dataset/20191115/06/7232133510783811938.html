      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few sessions, there was a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/14/bitcoin-btc-price-looks-set-for-another-breakdown/">steady decline</a> below the $8,800 level in bitcoin against the US Dollar. BTC broke the $8,750 and $8,700 levels to move further into a bearish zone.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a break below the $8,600 support area and the price settled well below the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, the price broke the $8,550 and $8,500 support levels.</p>
      <p>A new monthly low was formed near $8,457 and the price is currently consolidating losses. Besides, it is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,785 high to $8,457 low.</p>
      <p>On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $8,580 and $8,600 levels. The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/14/bitcoin-btc-price-poised-for-declines-unless-it-breaks-9k/">first key resistance for bitcoin</a> is near the $8,620 level. Additionally, it coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,785 high to $8,457 low.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there is a key declining channel forming with resistance near $8,710 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. To move into a positive zone, the price must break the $8,700 and $8,800 resistance levels.</p>
      <p>The main resistance is near $8,880, above which the price is likely to accelerate higher towards the $9,000 and $9,200 levels. On the downside, an initial support is near the $8,450 level.</p>
      <p>If there is another break down below the $8,450 level, the price may perhaps continue to move down below $8,400. The next major support is near the $8,300 and $8,200 levels, where the bulls are likely to appear.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/">chart</a>, bitcoin is clearly trading in a slow and steady decline below $8,700 and $8,800. Thus, there are high chances of more losses below the $8,500 and $8,450 levels. Conversely, a break above $8,700 might start a decent recovery in the near term.</p>
