      <h1>Facebook and Instagram are getting new fundraising tools</h1>

      <p>Facebook is launching new ways for users to donate money and host fundraisers across its apps as the festive season approaches.</p>
      <p>The company on Thursday revealed a new Fundraiser Sticker for Facebook Stories and a Donate Button for Instagram Business profiles.</p>
      <p>“In just a few taps, you can add a fundraiser sticker to your story to promote a specific nonprofit or personal fundraiser,” Facebook said <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/kicking-off-giving-season/">in a newsroom update</a>.</p>
      <p>The Donate Button on Instagram, meanwhile, is exclusively for nonprofit organisations with Business accounts.</p>
      <p>“We know every dollar counts, so 100% of what’s raised through nonprofit donate buttons and fundraisers on Facebook and Instagram goes directly to the organizations,” the company also said.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Facebook is also expanding its charity live streaming tool to all Facebook Gaming Level Up users after testing the feature in the United States last year.</p>
      <p>“During a live stream, gaming creators can now select causes for viewers to support, set donation goals, add a donation progress bar and share donation alerts within a live stream video,” the company explained.</p>
      <p>The new features are currently rolling out on both Instagram and Facebook.</p>
