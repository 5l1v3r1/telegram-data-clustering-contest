      <p>1 <i>The Absolute Book</i> by Elizabeth Knox (Victoria University Press, $35)</p>
      <p>“Knox’s writing has an extreme, dramatic intensity, both visual and emotional, an exactness, and an elegance of expression which result in an effect that is utterly convincing and at times profoundly alarming….<i>The Absolute Book</i> is a tour de force”: from Jane Stafford’s rave review at <a href="https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2019/10/31/869091/book-of-the-week-elizabeth-knox-fantastically"><b>ReadingRoom.</b></a></p>

      <p>“It concerns Sharn, a university lecturer who loses her job. Her friends and family drop away, and she needs to figure out who she is – and so she constructs herself as a perfume…The writing is evocative. Her craft is well-polished. But for me I admit I got a bit drowned in the detail of fragrances…It’s a mixed bag for me”: from a passive-aggressive review by Louise O’Brien, <i>9 to Noon</i>.</p>

      <p>"It begins with a troubling scene of domestic violence. A young woman is in a bathroom hacking at her long hair with a pair of tiny scissors. She is interrupted by an angry man who attempts to finish the job with a pair of hair clippers. She makes a run for the front door, but he stops her, dragging her back to the bathroom to finish the job. She screams. He hits her. Exactly why this couple are hiding in a remote house somewhere in New Zealand will gradually emerge ...<i>Call Me Evie</i> might best be described as a psychological thriller with shades of domestic noir. And it's an impressive debut for the New Zealand-born, Melbourne-based author:” from a rave review in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>.</p>
      <p>6 <i>Legacy</i> by Whiti Hereaka (Huia Publishers, $25)</p>

The author wrote to justice minister Andrew Little several months ago urging the government to investigate it as a miscarriage of justice. We asked her on Thursday: “Heard anything yet?” Her reply: “Not a word. Not hopeful. I need to write to him again. Oh that bloody woman, his secretary will say.”</p>
