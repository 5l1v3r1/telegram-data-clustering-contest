        <b>After last week’s 27-10 home defeat to Chester, Preston Grasshoppers head coach Paul Arnold says there couldn’t be a better fixture for a “backlash” performance than tomorrow’s visit to promotion-chasing Caldy.</b>

      <p>After being relegated last season, the Cheshire club are second in National League Two North, one point behind Fylde but with a game in hand.</p>
      <p>They have won all nine outings this season and racked up more than 350 points.</p>
      <p>So Hoppers will be under no illusions about the task ahead this weekend, especially after what will have been some forceful home truths at training from the coaches.</p>
      <p>Arnold threatened changes this week and he has shaken up most of the back division, as well as shuffling the pack slightly.</p>
      <p>Alex Hurst starts at full-back and only winger Jacob Browne retains his place in the threequarters, with Nick Gregson switched from centre to fly-half.</p>
      <p>Jordan Dorrington, on the wing, and centres James Fitzpatrick and Will Davidson all return.</p>
      <p>Up front, Noah Miller is back at prop as Hoppers ease Oga Mabaya back into full-time action, and Luke Procter starts at lock with Sam Wallbank switching to the back row. Flanker Toby Harrison and winger Tyler Spence drop down to the bench.</p>
      <p>Hoppers have lost three in a row away from home after the draw at Fylde and overall stand on three victories, a draw and six defeats. That leaves them 13th in the table, just above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Leaders Fylde, meanwhile, make the long trip to Luctonians to take on the club second from bottom. Fylde have won four in a row at Ansdell since that draw with Hoppers and have just one defeat in their 10 games to date.</p>
      <p>North One West pacesetters Wilmslow are the visitors to Vale of Lune this weekend and bring with them a record of seven victories and two defeats. Both clubs were relegated last season, after a 27-19 home defeat for Vale and a 7-7 draw at Wilmslow.</p>
      <p>Michael Forrest is unavailable and Charlie Lomas is injured. But Billy Swarbrick is back at scrum-half, while Al Crookall and Alfie Bolton are drafted into the threequarter line and ex-KGS pupil Blake Snell makes a first appearance among the replacements.</p>
      <p>Vale’s game at Broughton Park, postponed last month, has been rescheduled for November 30.</p>
      <p>Hoppers: Hurst; J Dorrington, Fitzpatrick, W Davidson, Browne; Gregson, Squirrell; Blanchard, Millea, Miller, Procter, Howard, Wallbank,Carlson, Lamprey. Replacements: Madden (or Purcell), Taylor, Harrison, B Dorrington, Spence.</p>
      <p>Vale: Eastwood; Fern, Higginson, Crookall, Bolton; Briggs, Swarbrick; Branford, Dokter, Pillow, Fellows, Cvijanovic, Powers, Ayrton, Robinson. Replacements: Kyle, Snell, Hunt.</p>
