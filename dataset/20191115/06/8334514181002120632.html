      <p>Commentators were aghast, with Fox head announcer Joe Buck describing the incident as “one of the worst things I’ve ever seen on a professional sports field.”</p>
      <p>Garrett was ejected after the ensuing melee, with just eight seconds left in the game and Cleveland already assured of the victory. Garrett most likely faces at least a multi-game suspension by the league.</p>
      <p>The incident started when Garrett tackled Rudolph well after the quarterback had thrown the ball.</p>
      <p>Rudolph clearly took offense, and grabbed at Garrett’s helmet. Garrett then did likewise and managed to rip off Rudolph’s helmet before using it to strike the quarterback in the head.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh players were incensed, with center Maurkice Pouncey throwing a couple of punches at Garrett, before trying to kick him in the head after he was wrestled to the ground.</p>
      <p>“Oh gosh. Oh my goodness,” Buck said as he watched a slow-motion replay of the incident.</p>
      <p>Garrett and Pouncey were ejected, as was another Cleveland player, Larry Ogunjobi.</p>
      <p>Rudolph did not appear to be seriously injured by the helmet strike.</p>
      <p>Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield did not defend his teammate’s behavior.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t see why it started but it’s inexcusable,” Mayfield, referring to Garrett, told Fox. “I don’t care, rivalry or not, we can’t do that.</p>
      <p>“That’s just endangering the other team. He’s going to get suspended. We don’t know how long and that hurts our team.”</p>
      <p>Cleveland won the game 21-7, improving to 4-6 on the season, while the Steelers dropped to 5-5.</p>
      <p>The teams meet again in 17 days.</p>
