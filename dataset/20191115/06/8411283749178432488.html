      <p>VIA has announced that Formosa Sumco Technology (FST) has adopted its AI technologies to improve process management and production of high quality silicon wafers. By integrating image recognition and intelligent learning algorithms, FST is confident of substantially enhancing defect detection, and production line integration of the new process in the near future.</p>
      <p>VIA said the terms of the cooperation include special attention to improve and upgrade existing infrastructure, with minimal disruption to equipment layout and personnel operating procedures. The system uses an image recognition and intelligent learning engine, designed with input from camera professionals to create a high-fidelity solution capable of a defect detection rate of 99.9%.</p>
      <p>The implementation of this advanced AI technology bolsters FST's continued efforts in setting the pace in the transition to an AI-led, Industry 4.0 model, VIA said.</p>
      <p>The project with FST underlines VIA's commitment to assist business partners to implement advanced AI technologies that elevate operational efficiency and improve existing manufacturing infrastructure.</p>
