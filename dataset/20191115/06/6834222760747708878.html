      <p>"<i><b>Jorge Lorenzo is a great person with a big heart who behaved like a true gentleman,</b></i>" were <b>Alberto Puig's words</b> after Jorge announced his retirement, which he himself knew of only a few days ago. The team manager was the one who planned Lorenzo's arrival in Honda and, today, he bore witness to his farewell to racing.</p>
      <p><i><b>"In my career as a manager, I was able to work with many great riders, and Jorge was a true gentleman. It's not often that you meet a champion with certain qualities</b></i> ," he said<i>. "He impressed me with his fairness and his way of behaving with people next to him. He made a courageous decision. I respect it, but I'm also sad. I'm sorry we weren't able to succeed with</i> <i>him</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Was stopping the best decision?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i>I don't know. It's not up to me to say. All I know is that both he and Honda tried everything to improve. From my point-of-view, I hope this was the best decision for him. Unfortunately, we didn't meet during the best moment of his career</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lorenzo said he disappointed you.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>"<b>That's not true, nor is it for Honda</b>. I know the Japanese well, and when I can't help a rider achieve certain goals, they get frustrated. The fact that Jorge stopped is not a liberation. Things between us didn't work, and we have to accept it. If anything, I'm worried because we lost another champion</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you think he will be able to return to racing, perhaps after a sabbatical year?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i>Those are personal choices. Surely, he'll have plenty of time to think about it. I don't know what to answer. <b>The only thing I want is for him to be happy</b></i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who will take Lorenzo's place?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>Frankly, I can't answer</b> <b>that</b>. We are logically thinking about the future, but we have not yet made a decision about it</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Not even for next week's tests?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>This is absolutely not a problem. The important thing is that Marquez  is able to try the new bike, nothing else</b>. Logically, it would be better if other riders did too, but Stefan Bradl will probably join us</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>For 2020, two names are constantly mentioned: Zarco and Alex Marquez.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>They're both on the list,</b> as are other riders, but I don't want to mention names now. We had little time to think, and we're not in a hurry</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is a team with the two Marquez brothers possible?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>Alex is on the list not because of his last name but because of the results he got</b>. Being the world champion in the Moto2 is an option</i>."</p>
