        <b>Derek Adams is prepared for a difficult day ahead as he prepares for his first league game as Morecambe manager.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having defeated Carlisle United in the EFL Trophy on Tuesday night, Adams and his Shrimps players return to League Two action tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The Shrimps head to Crawley Town, looking for a positive result to take them off the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>“It’s extremely tough,” Adams said of Saturday’s game, his 500th as a manager.</p>
      <p>“Crawley had a very good win against Scunthorpe United on Saturday in the FA Cup and it’s a difficult place to go to.”</p>
      <p>However, the Morecambe camp make the trip buoyed by their midweek win.</p>
      <p>It might have been a less than full-strength Carlisle side which arrived at the Globe Arena but Adams’ players had to overturn a half-time deficit before winning 3-1.</p>
      <p>“I thought the endeavour of the players was very good and we showed a bit of class of times,” he said.</p>
      <p>“A-Jay Leitch-Smith linked up play with Cole Stockton, the midfield players showed a bit of class at times on the ball, defenders defended and I think they enjoyed winning the game.”</p>
      <p>The midweek display was pleasing given the lack of preparation time.</p>
      <p>Adams had only taken one training session and admitted it had been a hectic few days.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s been difficult because I’ve had so many people wanting to talk to me and give me information.</p>
      <p>“We’ve won the game but I’d like to have had more time on the training field.</p>
      <p>“I’ve gone into the game with a different formation in the second half, different set-plays, the different way I manage.</p>
      <p>“The information I’ve been giving them is the taster course rather than the full course.”</p>
