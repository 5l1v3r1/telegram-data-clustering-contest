      <h1>Bajaj Chetak warranty, service details revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>The Chetak will have a 15,000km service with a 3-year/50,000km warranty, while the battery will have an estimated lifespan of 70,000km.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the Chetak Electric Yatra – a 3,000km-long journey that began when the electric scooter was unveiled in Delhi last month – concluded in Pune. Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto, attended the event and we received some more details about the two-wheeler manufacturer's new electric scooter; namely, the maintenance and warranty periods of the Chetak and its battery.</p>
      <p>While we await the exact battery specifications, we were told that it has been designed to last 70,000km. The scooter, meanwhile, will come with a three-year/50,000km warranty.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the maintenance of the e-scooter, the company-recommended service interval is every 15,000km – which is much further apart than what we see in its petrol-powered counterparts. This is because electric scooters have much fewer moving parts in the drivetrain and wear and tear of consumables like its brake pads will be of greater concern.</p>
      <p>We were also privy to some more information on the Chetak and what lies in store. Firstly, it was announced that <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/bajaj-chetak-e-scooter-bookings-to-open-in-january-2020-414915">the price of the Chetak will be announced in January when the company begins to accept bookings</a></b> for the new e-scooter. We were also informed that <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/high-performance-chetak-in-the-works-414914">KTM/Husqvarna are working with Bajaj to develop a high-performance electric scooter</a></b> and we could see the Chetak being used as the base platform for this model.</p>
