      <h1>Instagram Experimental Test on Hiding Like Counts Has Gone Worldwide</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:26:07+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:26</time> by <a rel="author">George Kamau</a></address>
      <p>In July this year, Instagram began testing hiding like counts on select countries such as Canada,  Ireland, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.  Early this week, the test was expanded to the United States and now it is rolling worldwide.</p>

      <p>This feature was announced at this year’s <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/05/02/facebook-f8-2019-highlights/">Facebook’s annual developer conference</a> with a motive to lessen the pressure on the platform. The giant photo-sharing network had become a popularity contest platform and Instagram was hoping to hide the number of likes a post gets will let its users post more authentic posts rather than posting the perfect photo to garner more likes.</p>
      <p>When I woke up today to check up on what I missed on Instagram from the previous night, I started seeing posts had no like counts. You’ve probably noticed it too.</p>
      <p>Only the person who posted that photo will actually see the number of likes. The like count will be hidden from public view.</p>
      <p>This is what you’ll be seeing:</p>

      <p>This <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/07/23/instagram-hiding-likes-people-love-them/">test has been well embraced</a> at least according to people who’ve had this feature from when it went live in other countries.</p>

      <p>This test of hiding likes won’t affect Instagram influencers as they’ll still have access to Instagram analytics that they can share with brands.</p>
      <p>This move has brought u<a href="https://techweez.com/2019/07/27/teens-switching-instagram-profiles-business-accounts/">nintended privacy consequences</a> as teens and young people are now turning their private accounts to public and business accounts in order to access these analytics.</p>

      <p>Celebrities such as <a href="https://thegrio.com/2019/11/12/nicki-minaj-instagram/">Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B4qm1B7A-6B/">Cardi B</a> have also shared their thoughts with Nicki posting in a now deleted tweetstorm that she will be boycotting the platform while Cardi argues that comments are more harmful than likes on Instagram.</p>

      <p>Other <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/influencers-and-big-instagram-users-say-theyre-not-worried">influencers</a> applauded this move saying that it will improve users mental health. Kim Kardashian who has 151 million followers said that ditching Instagram likes could be <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8724325/kim-kardashian-instagram-likes-mental-health">beneficial</a>.</p>
      <p>“As far as mental health… I think taking the likes away and taking that aspect away from [Instagram] would be really beneficial for people,” Kardashian West said at Lincoln Center’s Appel Room at the Time Warner Center.</p>
      <p>“I know the Instagram team has been having a bunch of conversations with people to get everyone’s take on that and they’re taking it really seriously, and that makes me happy,” she added.</p>
