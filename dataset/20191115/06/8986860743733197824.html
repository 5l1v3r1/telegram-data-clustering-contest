      <h1>Bukom Banku throws shots at Ghana Boxing Authority after revoking his licence</h1>

      <p>Ghanaian boxer Braimah Kamoko aka Bukom Banku has swiftly responded to the Ghana Boxing Authority(GBA) after they revoked his boxing license.</p>
      <p>According to the boxer, he does not care if the GBA takes away his license or not because he has a different license to act movies, drive and also to do music.</p>
      <p><i>“The license you are taking from me, are you also taking away my license for driving and acting in films? I have the license to act in films and to do music, so what is a boxing license?” </i>Bukom Banku said in an attempt to get back at the GBA.</p>
      <p>After losing to Bastie Samir in 2017, the cruiserweight fighter refused to honor a rematch. In the process, Banku also refused to refund an amount of GH 17,000 to the organizers and promoters of the fight.</p>
      <p>He disclosed that does not understand why the GBA would revoke his license over his issues with Box Office Sports Promotion.</p>
      <p><i>“Bastie beat me and stopped me in round seven. I understand that I lost but [I’ve moved on],”</i> he stated.</p>
      <p>Bukom Banku recently won his first international fight after recording a knockout victory over Hungarian opponent, Ferenc Albert.</p>
