      <h1>You’re taking seniority ‘World Cup’ – Kwaku Azar to Amidu on “disrespectful’ Dame</h1>

      <p>Professor Stephen Kwaku Asare lias Kwaku Azar, known for his tireless advocacy for reforms in Ghana’s legal education, has urged Deputy Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Godfred Yeboah Dame, to continue to aggressively state his case in court as he has always done, praising him for being a competent attorney.</p>
      <p>His advice follows accusations of disrespect levelled against Mr Dame by Special Prosecutor Martin Amidu when the two ‘clashed’ in court.</p>
      <p>Prof Kwaku Asare thinks that the outburst of Mr Amidu to the effect that he deserved respect from Mr Dame because his son is older than Mr Dame may amount to taking the concept of seniority too far.</p>
      <p>“Amidu wants Dame to respect him in court because his son is even older than Dame.  Is this not taking this senior thing a little too far? Dame is a very competent attorney and he should aggressively state his case, as he has done,” he argued on social media in a post sighted by MyNewsGh.com</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the Deputy Attorney General successfully argued in court against an application by Mr Amidu to the effect that the Attorney General office was not expediting actions to retrieve monies wrongly paid to Waterville by the Government of Ghana.</p>
      <p>The court ruled that the application filed by Mr Amidu was incompetent and therefore dismissed it.</p>
      <p>Upon the dismissal of his application as incompetent, a visibly angered Mr Amidu complained about the disrespect of Mr Dame, remarking “my son is even older than you. You don’t respect,” after he had joined the public gallery.</p>
