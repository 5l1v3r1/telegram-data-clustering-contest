      <p>Police have charged a 15-year-old boy over the murder of two teenagers at a house party in Milton Keynes.</p>
      <p>The boy, from Milton Keynes, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested on Thursday and has subsequently been charged with two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>He will appear before Milton Keynes Magistrates’ Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>Two other people arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, have been released under investigation.</p>
      <p>The charges are in connection with the deaths of 17-year-olds Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice, who were stabbed to death at a house party in Archford Croft, Emerson Valley, Milton Keynes, on October 19.</p>

      <p>Ryan Brown, 23, and a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were left with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>Thames Valley Police Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter previously said there were still "very important" witnesses who had not yet come forward with vital information about the incident - and some who were "refusing to assist".</p>
      <p>He said: “I know there will be various reasons for being reluctant to get involved but please, please think about the fact that Dom and Ben have been killed and how you would feel if this was your family.</p>
      <p>“I imagine you would want justice and you wouldn’t want people to get away with what they have done. I am sure you would want justice for your own family. </p>
      <p>“I would ask therefore for you to think about this and do the right thing."</p>
