      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 15): Shares in RCE Capital Bhd rose 1.73% in the morning session today, following a positive technical outlook on the stock.</p>
      <p>At the midday break, RCE Capital added 3 sen to RM1.76, for a market capitalisation of RM649.47 million.</p>
      <p>RHB Retail Research said RCE Capital may move higher after it continued holding above the RM1.62 support.</p>
      <p>In a trading stocks note today, the research house said given that it has formed a long white candle above the rising 21-day simple moving average (SMA) line, this means that the bullish sentiment has been enhanced.</p>
      <p>"A positive bias may emerge above the RM1.69 level, with an exit set below the RM1.62 threshold.</p>
      <p>"Towards the upside, the immediate resistance is at the RM1.90 mark. This is followed by the RM2.00 level," it said.</p>
