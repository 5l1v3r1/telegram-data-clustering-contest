      <p>Ikea Canada’s plan to transform its business model is not going to include opening a store in Victoria.</p>
      <p>An Ikea Canada spokeswoman confirmed the company’s “global transformation” project that includes opening smaller, city-centre locations would not be on the cards for the Island.</p>
      <p>“Our current focus for the city centre approach is on the Toronto market. At this time, there are no additional markets identified,” said Ikea’s Kristin Newbigging.</p>
      <p>Last year, Ikea announced a multi-year process to transform its business model around the world to accommodate the “changing way our customers live and shop” due to urbanization and new technology.</p>
      <p>Ikea plans to look at new store formats, enhance in-store experiences, invest in its digital experience and improve its distribution networks.</p>
      <p>The plan also calls for significant cuts in jobs across Ikea Canada, which has 14 stores, an online store, five pick-up and order points and 17 collection points, including Victoria and Nanaimo.</p>
      <p>Ikea once had a store in downtown Victoria, but it closed in the late 1980s.</p>
