      <p>LONDON: Roger Federer produced a near-flawless performance as he avenged his Wimbledon defeat by Novak Djokovic and qualified for the last four of the ATP Finals with a 6-4, 6-3 victory on Thursday (Nov 14).</p>
      <p>The Swiss started the tournament with a chastening straight-sets defeat to Dominic Thiem but found his best form when it mattered.</p>

      <p>Defeat for the second seed spells the end of his bid to overtake Rafael Nadal and finish as year-end number one.</p>
      <p>Roared on by a raucous packed house at London's O2 Arena, six-time champion Federer looked in the groove from the start, cranking up the pressure on Djokovic's serve and dropping just three points on his own serve in the whole set.</p>
      <p>The Serbian upped his game at the start of the second set but Federer saved the one break point he faced and broke twice to canter to victory.</p>
      <p>The third seed, making his 17th appearance at the ATP Finals, is into his 16th semi-final at the year-end event.</p>
      <p>Djokovic needed to win the title to have a chance at knocking Nadal off the top spot, but now the Spaniard is guaranteed to finish the year as the top-ranked player for the fifth time, tying him with Federer, Djokovic and American Jimmy Connors.</p>
      <p>"Great atmosphere, great opponent," said Federer. "It was definitely incredibly special. I enjoyed it from the beginning.</p>
      <p>"I played incredible and I knew I had to because that's what Novak does. It was definitely magical. You guys made it super special, I can't thank you enough."</p>
      <p>Speaking about what was different from Wimbledon, he said: "I won match point I guess. It was so close at Wimbledon. It was a privilege to play that match, so many ups and downs. I couldn't be more happy right now."</p>
      <p>Federer finishes second in Group Bjorn Borg, behind Dominic Thiem, who beat both Federer and Djokovic earlier this week. The Swiss will face the Group Andre Agassi winner on Saturday.</p>

        <b>METRONOMIC FEDERER</b>
      </p>
      <p>Djokovic looked nervy at the start of the winner-takes-all contest, double-faulting twice in the third game, in which he was broken to love.</p>
      <p>As cries of "Let's go Roger, let's go" rang around the cavernous stadium, Federer was dead-eyed on his serve, hitting eight aces, including a second-serve ace, in the first set.</p>
      <p>Federer's service level dipped in the second set and Djokovic earned his first break point of the match in the fourth game, which the Swiss saved.</p>
      <p>He broke Djokovic again in the fifth game to take an iron grip on the match and repeated the trick to take the second set 6-3.</p>
      <p>Djokovic, who now holds a 26-23 advantage, had won their past five meetings, including their epic five-set battle in the final at Wimbledon in July, during which he saved two championship points.</p>
      <p>Djokovic admitted Federer deserved to win, saying he "did everything right" and admitting he himself had played badly.</p>
      <p>But he said he was happy with his season overall, adding: "If I have to draw the line, I think it was still a very good season, winning two Slams and five titles."</p>
      <p>In Thursday's early match in Group Bjorn Borg, which was a dead rubber, eighth seed Matteo Berrettini beat Thiem 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.</p>
      <p>In doing so, the 23-year-old became the first Italian to win a match at the season-ending championships.</p>
      <p>Fifth seed Thiem did not hit the heights he reached during his three-set win against Djokovic, notching just 12 winners compared with 50 against the Serbian.</p>
      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas has already qualified for the semi-finals from Group Andre Agassi, leaving Nadal, defending champion Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev to scrap it out for the other spot on Friday.</p>
