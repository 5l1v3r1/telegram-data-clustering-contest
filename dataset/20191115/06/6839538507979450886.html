      <p>Calls by elders to ban police carrying guns in indigenous communities following the shooting of an Aboriginal teenager have been rejected by the Northern Territory's chief minister and police.</p>
      <p>Kumanjayi Walker, 19, was shot and killed in his home by a police constable as two officers tried to arrest him in his home in Yuendumu, 300km northwest of Alice Springs last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Numerous Yuendumu elders said they wanted police guns banned in the community after the death because trust was damaged and it sent the wrong message and frightened children.</p>
      <p>"We are not in the city, we are in the desert," Warlpiri elder Ned Hargraves told ABC.</p>
      <p>"In Yuendumu when there were good policemen there, they never wore the guns."</p>
      <p>He made the comments during a meeting with Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt at the Alice Springs Showgrounds, where a camp has been set up for Warlpiri people who have travelled to the town this week to protest.</p>
      <p>Independent MP and former Labor member Scott McConnell, whose electorate includes Yuendumu, said he thought firearms did not look right in what should be a community policing environment and reducing them could be "part of the healing process".</p>
      <p>However, Chief Minister Michael Gunner has ruled out interfering with police tactics and ordering them to change practices.</p>
      <p>"Police have to make operational decisions about how they best serve and protect Territorians, and we will continue to support them in making those decisions," he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The NT Police Association criticised the chief minister this week for saying "consequences will flow as a result of that investigation".</p>
      <p>Constable Zach Rolfe, 28 has been charged with murder. He was wearing a camera and its footage will be used as evidence.</p>
      <p>The police union accused Mr Gunner of pre-empting the investigation and implying its member was in the wrong.</p>
      <p>NT Police ruled out a change over guns saying "the best means of restoring trust is through continuing engagement".</p>
      <p>"Police will continue to carry guns as part of their usual operational accoutrements, which meets the legislative requirements for health and safety as an employer."</p>
      <p>NT Police acting Assistant Commissioner Travis Wurst said a confrontation had occurred in which Mr Walker stabbed a policeman, which the family disputes.</p>
      <p>NT Coroner Greg Cavanagh is holding an inquest into Mr Walker's death, separate to the prosecution of Const Rolfe who has been bailed ahead of a court hearing on December 19.</p>
      <p>The bail has angered some Warlpiri people including Eddie Robertson, the grandfather of Walker's partner, who said an indigenous person facing a charge as serious as murder would not be released.</p>
      <p>Const Rolfe is a former army member who served in Afghanistan and received a national bravery award as a police officer after rescuing two tourists during a flood.</p>
      <p>There was unrest after a rally in Alice Springs overnight, in which a local man was bashed, rocks were thrown at police and numerous vehicles and businesses damaged, including a police car.</p>
      <p>The fatal shooting has also sparked protests across Australia.</p>
