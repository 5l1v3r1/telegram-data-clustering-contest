      <h1>SC ruling on Singh brothers halts IHH Healthcare's Fortis takeover plan</h1>
      <h2>The Supreme Court held Fortis' founders -- Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh -- guilty of contempt of court</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:57:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:57</time> by <a rel="author">Ari Altstedter and Upmanyu Trivedi | Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>The Supreme Court has refused to lift the block on completion of the takeover of embattled hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd. by Malaysian operator <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ihh-healthcare">IHH Healthcare </a>Bhd, the latest twist in one of the country’s most contentious and long drawn out corporate battles.</p>
      <p>The court held Fortis’ founders -- <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/malvinder-singh-and-shivinder-singh">Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh </a>-- guilty of contempt of court and said it could start similar proceedings against the company, according to a judgment Friday. This effectively halts IHH’s open offer to Fortis shareholders that would have brought its holdings in India’s second largest hospital company above 50%. IHH is already Fortis’ largest shareholder with a 31% stake.</p>
      <p>Fortis shares plunged as much as 17.4%, the biggest intra-day drop since February 2018, after the verdict was read out. Fortis and IHH didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comments on the court ruling.</p>
      <p>The block comes just as IHH’s efforts to turn around Fortis’ fortunes through cost-cutting was starting to show results. It will hobble the company’s attempt to move past a scandal in which it was allegedly defrauded of millions of dollars by its founders, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/singh-brothers">Singh brothers.</a></p>

      <p>IHH’s attempt to become Fortis’ controlling shareholder was halted last year, when Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo Co. contested the deal as part of its efforts to recover $500 million from the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/singh-brothers">Singh brothers.</a></p>
      <p>Daiichi Sankyo said that it had been promised some Fortis shares by the Singhs in a decade-old fraud claim, before the shares were seized by the brothers’ creditors.</p>
      <p>The takeover fight for Fortis has seen as many as four separate bids, two scrapped deals, and the replacement of most of the company’s board.</p>

      <p>Shareholders finally approved Malaysian hospital operator IHH’s takeover offer in August 2018, and the company has since embarked on a thorough revamp. New Chief Executive Officer Ashutosh Raghuvanshi’s cost cutting campaign has already begun to show in the company’s results.</p>
      <p>Daiichi is also pursuing the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/singh-brothers">Singh brothers </a>directly for the money it says it is owed in another court case.</p>
