      <h1>Hong Kong’s biggest music festival cancelled over political unrest</h1>

      <p>Clockenflap, Hong Kong’s biggest music festival, has been cancelled, organisers said on Friday, the highest-profile event so far to fall victim to the increasingly violent political unrest engulfing the city.</p>
      <p>British folk-rock sensations Mumford &amp; Sons and American star Halsey were among the headliners for the festival this year, which was scheduled for November 22-24.</p>
      <p>“Due to the escalation of the crisis this week, and therefore the uncertainty this creates for the coming weeks, Clockenflap 2019 will be cancelled,” the organisers said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Until this week we were fully committed to delivering the festival. Unfortunately, the situation has now made this impossible.”</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy protests have escalated in the past week with widespread travel chaos wrought by roadblocks and targeted vandalism of metro stations and lines.</p>
      <p>Violent clashes between police and protesters have left parts of the city debris-strewn.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, a 22-year-old student died from head injuries sustained during a fall as police skirmished with demonstrators. And on Thursday, a 70-year-old man died after being hit by a brick.</p>
      <p>Clockenflap is an annual festival that takes place in front of Hong Kong’s iconic harbour and attracts tens of thousands of fans.</p>
      <p>It is the latest in a growing list of banned, cancelled or postponed events in Hong Kong’s normally packed social calendar.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s annual pride parade due on Saturday was downgraded to a stationary rally after police banned the traditionally boisterous and colourful march.</p>
      <p>The WTA Hong Kong Open, Oxfam’s annual trail run fundraiser as well as concerts by acclaimed K-Pop acts and comedians have been pulled as the city reels from the protests.</p>
