      <p>North Korea has called former US Vice President Joe Biden a “rabid dog” that “must be beaten to death with a stick” in its latest swipe against foreign and political leaders it sees as hostile to its leadership.</p>
      <p>The commentary published by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said the US presidential hopeful “reeled off a string of rubbish against the dignity” of the North’s supreme leadership and deserves “merciless punishment”.</p>
      <p>North Korea often unleashes crude insults against foreign leaders and politicians over what it sees as slanderous remarks towards its leadership.</p>
      <p>Mr Biden has repeatedly lamented President Donald Trump’s embrace of authoritarian foreign leaders</p>
