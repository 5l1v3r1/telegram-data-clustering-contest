      <p>Chris Smith died in 2017, at the age of 64, having been a fan of the club since attending his first match when he was just two-years-old.</p>
      <p>Over the course of six decades, Mr Smith collected a huge range of memorabilia, ranging from scarves, photographs and programmes to badges, tickets and more.</p>
      <p>After his death, Mr Smith's sons took what they wanted from his collection and the family decided the rest should be auctioned.</p>

      <p>Part of the collection is now up for sale with Midlands Sports Auctions, based in West Bromwich.</p>
      <p>Owner Matthew Bytheway, a friend of Mr Smiths, said: "Chris' interest goes way back to his grandfather, Sam Powell, who was one of the club's trainers in the 1920s. He followed Shrewsbury home and away.</p>
      <p>"Sadly he was battling with multiple sclerosis and had to start walking with a stick, then he ended up in a wheelchair, but his love for his club stayed strong."</p>
      <p>The pair met about 20 years ago through auctions, as Mr Smith was always a keen collector and trader, and became friends.</p>
      <p>Mr Bytheway said his friend was well-known for having the largest and most impressive Shrewsbury Town collection.</p>
      <p>He said it was in fact one of the best football collections from any team that he had ever seen.</p>
      <p>"It is absolutely amazing how he kept it all," he said.</p>
      <p>"He basically transformed what was a double garage into a space for all of his items. It was full of shelving. As it grew he also ended up shelving the dining room too.</p>
      <p>"He had items dating back to the early 1900s. His collection is absolutely priceless has he has some pieces that are completely unique and one off."</p>
      <p>The auction, which is hosted on thesaleroom.com is live until November 17.</p>
