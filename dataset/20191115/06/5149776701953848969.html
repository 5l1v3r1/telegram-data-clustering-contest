      <h2>The Reds face a crucial trip to fellow promotion hopefuls Bristol City when Championship football returns after the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Promotion to the Premier League is there for the taking this season, according to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> captain Ben Watson.</p>
      <p>After 15 games, the Reds are nicely positioned in the Championship under new head coach Sabri Lamouchi having enjoyed an excellent start to the new campaign amid a wide open division.</p>
      <p>Forest are fifth having racked up 28 points and have a game in hand on those sides above them in the league, following the recent postponement of their home date with Reading.</p>
      <p>Having suffered successive defeats to Wigan and Hull after the last international break, the Reds responded well <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/forest-derby-county-ben-watson-3514218">beating Luton and Derby</a>.</p>

      <p>Those two wins see Forest occupying a place inside the top six, in what <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/ben-watson">Watson</a> believes is one of the more open seasons in recent memory which presents the Reds with quite an opportunity.</p>
      <p>“I think so,” said <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/i-expecting-call-ben-watson-3445292">Watson</a> when asked if the Reds will have a better chance of ending their two-decade wait for Premier League football.</p>
      <p>“I can’t see anyone really running away with it.</p>
      <p>“In previous years that’s been the case. One or two have pulled away.</p>
      <p>“At Christmas time we’ll have a better idea of what’s going to happen, though at the minute, it’s going to be a close one.</p>
      <p>“It’s there for the taking."</p>
      <p>Lamouchi's Reds have picked up impressive wins at Fulham, Swansea, Stoke and Luton, while seeing off Birmingham, Brentford, Barnsley and the Rams on home soil.</p>
      <p>Their three defeats have fallen against West Brom, Wigan and Hull, with Watson admitting no side has blown him away, yet.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s been a game or a team we’ve played this season where you’ve gone ‘wow’ so it’s there for us," he said.</p>
      <p>“We’ll be saying that and there’s 10 other teams saying that.”</p>

      <p>Forest’s start has seen them win four times at the City Ground and the same amount on the road, including a league and cup victory over their arch-rivals Derby.</p>
      <p>The Reds have also topped the league, as well as spending a spell second, and it’s that open feeling to the league Watson which means you can’t get too high or low after winning or losing with consistency once again the buzz word of the year.</p>
      <p>“It’s been fantastic,” he said of the Reds’ opening three months.</p>
      <p>“You can look at 10 teams in the division and they’ve all had similar starts.</p>
      <p>“We were joint-top at one point, lost two games and then we were tenth.</p>
      <p>"That’s how close it is.</p>
      <p>"Winning (at Luton) was huge and put us back in the play-off positions and with a game in hand, we’re sitting in a nice position.</p>

      <p>“Like I say, though, you’re two defeats from dropping down to 12th and you’re two wins away from being top of the league.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to get too excited, it’s early days.</p>
      <p>“Like always in this league, it’s about consistency.</p>
      <p>“I know we lost those two games, but it’s how quickly you get that win and you go on a little run again.</p>
      <p>“We are going to enjoy it, more importantly we’re going to enjoy the challenge that’s ahead of us.”</p>
