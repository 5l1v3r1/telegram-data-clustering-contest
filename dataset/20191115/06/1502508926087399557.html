      <p>A multi-billion-dollar <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pentagon">Pentagon </a>cloud-computing contract was awarded fairly and with no "outside influence", Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Friday.</p>
      <p>Esper said he was confident the competition "was conducted freely and fairly without any type of outside influence," speaking on a visit to Seoul.</p>
      <p>His comments came a day after <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/amazon">Amazon </a>challenged the award of the $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure programme, better known as JEDI, to Microsoft, alleging "unmistakable bias".</p>
