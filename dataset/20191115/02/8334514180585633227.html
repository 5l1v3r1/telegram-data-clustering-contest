      <p>(Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s shares sky-rocketed on Thursday after the electric car maker surprised investors with a rare quarterly profit, and delivered a record number of cars while keeping a lid on costs.</p>

      <p>The news also helped the stock cross $300 for the first time since March 1 and surpass General Motors Co as the most valuable car company in the United States.</p>
      <p>The following six graphs offer an illustration of Tesla’s progress in key areas.</p>
      <h3>DELIVERIES</h3>
      <p>The company said it was “highly confident” in exceeding the low end of its 2019 forecast range.</p>
      <p>“Not only were the numbers good, the group confirmed it is ahead of schedule for the Model Y as well as the new plant in Shanghai. The group has had its fair share of setbacks over the years, but now it seems to be moving up a gear,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.</p>

      <h3>OPERATING EXPENSES</h3>
      <p>The carmaker, which is trying to keep a lid on costs, said it had cut expenses 16% on a year-on-year basis, citing improvements in operating efficiency and a reduction in manufacturing and material costs.</p>
      <p>“Stronger than anticipated 3Q results highlight progress in operational efficiencies; however, we see several items during the quarter as unsustainable on a near to mid-term basis,” Cowen analysts said, pointing to operating and capital expenses.</p>

      <h3>GROSS MARGINS</h3>
      <p>Tesla’s gross margins, an important profit indicator for investors, surpassed expectations in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>JP Morgan analysts said they were not certain about the quality of the gross margin beat in the third quarter, though.</p>

      <h3>FREE CASH FLOW AND DEBT:</h3>
      <p>The electric carmaker expects generally to be cash flow positive and said it was now self-funding. Some on Wall Street were skeptical.</p>
      <p>“We believe Tesla has been deferring Shanghai capex payments into 2020, so cash flow could get hit further,” RBC analyst Joseph Spak said.</p>

      <h3>SHARE REACTION TO QUARTERLY REPORTS:</h3>
      <p>A year ago, Tesla gave a quarterly report that similarly smashed investors’ expectations, igniting a rally that sent its shares 31% higher over the next two months, only to see the stock decline through much of 2019 over worries about corporate governance, profitability and demand for the Model 3.</p>
      <p>“As Musk talks the talk and usually has not consistently delivered, last night Elon &amp; the team walked the walk in strong fashion as Q3 looks to be an inflection point quarter for the Tesla story that will cause a historic short covering this morning in shares which have languished this year,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.</p>

      <h3>CASH POSITION</h3>
      <p>Investors have been worried about the automaker’s cash burn. Tesla’s balance sheet now appears extremely healthy, Baird analyst Ben Kallo said.</p>
      <p>“Bears may argue Tesla is underinvesting, though we believe current and historical CapEx and R&amp;D investments should continue to support an attractive top-line growth profile”.</p>
