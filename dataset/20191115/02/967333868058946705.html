      <p>On the eve of the protests by the residents of El Alto, who are mainly supporters of former president Evo Morales, people were dispersed by <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911141077302533-security-officers-in-bolivia-use-tear-gas-batons-against-pro-morales-protesters/">the security forces using tear gas</a>. Fires being set in historic buildings was also reported.</p>
      <p>Opposition lawmaker Jeanine Anez <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911141077307212-legitimate-authorities-in-bolivia-could-be-recognised-only-after-elections-mfa/">declared herself interim president</a> at an extraordinary session in Parliament that was boycotted by Morales’ socialist party. Due to the boycott, the quorum necessary to legitimise Anez was not met, however, Bolivia’s highest court has recognised her as interim president.</p>

Following his resignation, Morales left for Mexico after being granted political asylum there.</p>
      <p>Bolivia plunged into crisis following the presidential election on 20 October, which saw Morales secure his fourth term in office. The opposition, however, refused to accept the election results, citing alleged irregularities in vote-counting procedures that were subsequently confirmed by the Organisation of American States. The developments prompted mass protests that later turned violent.</p>
