      <p>LONDON, Nov 15 — Reykjavik has its penis museum and from this weekend London will have a vagina museum — a place to tackle taboos and learn a little bit more about women’s bodies.</p>
      <p>In the heart of Camden, a tourist centre and hub of alternative culture in the north of the British capital, the sign for the “Vagina Museum” on an old barn door attracts a few curious glances.</p>
      <p>Nestled between shops selling vintage clothes and souvenirs, it is the first permanent museum in the world dedicated to this part of the female anatomy.</p>
      <p>“I found out there was a penis museum and no vagina equivalent, so I made it,” said founder Florence Schechter, a science communicator.</p>
      <p>Far from being a cabinet of curiosities, the little museum intends to be instructive, with its first goal to expose myths around the vagina.</p>
      <p>Some of the claims displayed and then debunked are that “if you use a tampon you are no longer a virgin”, “periods are dirty” and that “the clitoris is impossible to find”.</p>
      <p>For Schechter, who has already organised three temporary exhibitions on the same theme, the goal is not just to educate and address women’s self-image but to improve public health.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Dying of embarrassment’</b>
      </p>
      <p>A survey by a British campaign organisation last year revealed that a quarter of women avoid smear tests for cervical cancer — half because they were uncomfortable with the procedure.</p>
      <p>“People are literally dying of embarrassment because things like cervical cancer aren’t being picked up quick enough,” Schechter told AFP.</p>
      <p>Another study by polling company YouGov earlier this year indicated that 52 per cent of Britons could not identify the vagina on a diagram.</p>
      <p>The same study also found almost half of women were unaware that they should not wash inside their vagina, to avoid a risk of infection.</p>
      <p>A questionnaire at the start of the museum calls on visitors to test their knowledge.</p>
      <p>One section is dedicated to hygiene, with commercial products sold as “virginity soaps” or creams claiming to tighten the vagina.</p>
      <p>“These products are perpetuating the idea to people with vaginas that what they have is not good enough,” said museum curator Sarah Creed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sorry mum!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The museum attempts to normalise periods and make them things of beauty, such as with a sculpture of a tampon on which blood is replaced with glittering red sequins.</p>
      <p>Less glamorous is the underwear stained with vaginal discharge, framed on the wall in an attempt to show what is normal.</p>
      <p>“This is how much I feel about it. This is my bleached underwear, I put it in a frame to tell you this is fine. Sorry mum!” said Creed.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the opening tomorrow, the museum held a number of events that organisers said drew a diverse crowd aged from two to 98.</p>
      <p>Schechter said she expects to attract more visitors than she might have a few years ago, before the #MeToo movement put a new spotlight on women’s issues and discrimination.</p>
      <p>Some local residents are worried about the licence the museum has to sell alcohol, fearing drunken groups of young people attending.</p>
      <p>But visitors hoping for something steamy risk being disappointed, as the museum is more educational than titillating.</p>
      <p>They could however console themselves with the gift shop, which offers earrings in the shape of vulvas or postcards proclaiming “Viva La Vulva”. — AFP</p>
