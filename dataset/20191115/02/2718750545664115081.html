      <p>Lawrence Paull, the production designer for <i>Blade Runner </i>and <i>Back to the Future</i>,<i> </i>has died. He was 81. Paull was nominated for an Academy Award in art direction with David L. Snyder for <i>Blade Runner, </i>based on a novel by Philip K. Dick<i>. </i>In a statement, Ridley Scott told <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/lawrence-paull-dead-dies-blade-runner-1203405487/"><i>Variety</i></a><i>, </i>“I was always struck by his staunch and faithful support of the strange plan for the unique world of <i>Blade Runner.</i>” Paull won a BAFTA for <i>Blade Runner </i>and was nominated again for <i>Back to the Future. </i>After retiring from production design, he helped establish MFA curriculums in production design at Chapman University and the AFI Conservatory.</p>
      <p>Paull lived to see the month in which his most lauded work is set. <i>Blade Runner </i>takes place in November 2019 Los Angeles, which Paull imagined as rain-soaked and glowing with neon. Paull collaborated with Scott, Snyder, and futurist Syd Mead to build the world of <i>Blade Runner.</i> Other films on which he served as production designer include <i>Escape from L.A., City Slickers, Predator 2</i>, and <i>Romancing the Stone</i>.</p>
