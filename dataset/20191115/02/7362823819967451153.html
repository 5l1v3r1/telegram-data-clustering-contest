      <h1>YouTuber's gender reveal by way of fart stunt draws strong reactions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:07:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:07</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>A popular <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/youtube-star-max-lee-hot-water-naked-ikea-stunt">YouTuber</a> has taken the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting">gender reveal</a> craze to an entirely new level.</p>
      <p>Prankster Paige Ginn shocked her 300,000 Instagram followers on Tuesday in a video where she appears to reveal the gender of her baby by passing gas. It's unclear whether or not Ginn is actually pregnant or was using the gender reveal as a provocation. </p>
      <p>The cheeky stunt, which had been viewed more than 700,000 times as of Thursday night, shows Ginn lying on the ground in front of blue and pink balloons. Within seconds, she releases blue smoke from her rear end just before people are seen celebrating in the background.</p>
      <p>Reactions to the video were colorful.</p>
