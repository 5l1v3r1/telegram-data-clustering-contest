      <h1>Google Fi courting travelers by selling SIM cards in airport vending machines</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:50:10+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>Google Fi is a good deal for international travelers at $10 per GB in over 200 countries and territories. The MVNO is now directly targeting those potential customers by selling SIM cards at international airport terminals in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Back in February, Google started selling Fi SIM cards at <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/02/11/google-fi-best-buy/">Best Buy</a> stores and expanded to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/01/google-fi-sim-target/">Target</a> this November. These kits — though with slightly different branding — are now being sold in vending machines at airports in the U.S.</p>
      <p>These kiosks prominently feature Google Fi branding, but other SIMs and travel-related accessories are being sold in rows below. They cost $10, but you get a $10 Fi credit on your first bill, so it’s essentially free.</p>
      <p>The vending machine and packaging reminds users to “Activate in the U.S. before you go” as an address stateside is required to register for the Google MVNO.</p>

      <p>So far, these Google Fi vending machines have appeared at JFK Terminal 4 and Newark Terminal C. Both are for international flights, and appeared recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleFi/comments/dvv34x/spotted_a_fi_vending_machine_at_jfk_airport/">according to those on Reddit</a>. Fi subscribers can pay per GB on the original Flexible plan or join the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/17/google-fi-unlimited-plan/">new Unlimited plan</a> that provides high-speed data up to 22 GB every month, but caps video at 480p.</p>
      <p>Longtime subscribers might remember <a href="https://9to5google.com/2017/04/24/project-fis-travel-trolley-vending-machines-w-free-travel-goodies-are-now-at-9-airports/">Project Fi “Travel Trolley”</a> vending machines at airports that gave away free travel swag, including fuzzy socks and sleep masks. Overall, this is a smart strategy for Google to pursue that directly taps into how people have a tendency to buy — no matter the exuberant cost — last-minute essentials at airports.</p>
