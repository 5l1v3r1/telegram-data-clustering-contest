      <h1>Reaction by Tiger’s Shroff’s sister Krishna on Disha Patani’s photo in sports bra triggers wild speculations</h1>

      <p>In yet another sign that Disha Patani is officially in a relationship with actor Tiger Shroff, the <i>Bharat </i>actress on Thursday shared a bold photo of herself to promote a fashion brand that she’s endorsed for several years now. Although this is not the first time Disha has shared a bold photo of herself from her social media pages, this photo evoked an instant reaction from Tiger’s sister Krishna Shroff, who posted ‘fire’ emojis to suggest that her fit body was capable of setting the internet ablaze. But, some fans wondered if the cute exchange of pleasantries between Disha and her ‘future’ sister-in-law was a sign that the two had ‘patched up’ by burying their alleged differences. While others concluded that this was another sign of a brewing romance between Disha and Krishna’s brother.</p>

      <p>In her latest photo, Disha was seen dressed in Calvin Klein’s magenta pink sports bra and matching colour tights. Kirshna complimented her for her fit body as she wrote with ‘fire’ emoji, “Body.”</p>
      <p>Disha too replied with heart emoji as she wrote, “thank you kishuu.”</p>

      <p>This cute exchange led many to conclude that Disha and Krishna had buried their differences. One wrote, “Have you both patched up? Good.”</p>
      <p>The latest exchange between Disha and Krishna comes just weeks after the latter publicly stated that her brother Tiger was ‘100%’ single. Her comments were indicative of the fact that Tiger was not dating Disha.</p>

      <p>When asked about her rumoured romance with her <i>Baaghi 2 </i>co-star, Disha had recently said that she was trying hard to impress Tiger but far from succeeding in her efforts. She had told a Bollywood portal, “I’ve been trying for so long, it’s been so many years and I’ve been trying to impress him. Now I’ve done this film Bharat where I’m doing all these stunts and I thought maybe he’ll get impressed but no luck. Yeah, we go to eat but that doesn’t mean he’s impressed, not like that like the crush impressed, but he likes everybody’s pictures like that. You must speak to him the next time. He’s shy and I’m shy so nobody’s breaking the ice.”</p>
      <p>Not too long ago, Tiger had <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/omg-tiger-shroff-publicly-confirms-disha-patani-is-his-lady-love-after-war-creates-box-office-history/268167/">responded to Disha’s praise</a> for his film <i>War </i>with red heart.</p>
