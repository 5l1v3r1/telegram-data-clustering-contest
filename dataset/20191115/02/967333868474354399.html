        <b>An official with the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) confirmed earlier this week that the military has launched field tests for its Lightweight Polyethylene Armor for Extremity Protection - a primary component of the force’s long-awaited “Iron Man” suit.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Though <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911081077260983-us-air-force-tests-athena-laser-capable-of-neutralizing-multiple-drone-targets/">drone technology</a> is on the rise and expected to be a key player in the future of armed combat, “combat evaluation” for brand new body armor with over 44% body coverage is now underway, according to SOCOM spokesman and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Tim Hawkins.</p>
      <blockquote>Hawkins explained to <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/socom-body-armor-iron-man">Task &amp; Purpose</a> on Wednesday that not only does the Lightweight Polyethylene Armor for Extremity Protection offer more than the 19% of coverage provided by standard infantry armor, but it’s also 25%, or 3 pounds, lighter and offers added defense for the wearer’s shoulders, forearms, groin and obliques.</blockquote>
      <p>The armor in question comes as a subsystem of the SOCOM’s longstanding <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201702161050766101-us-special-iron-man-suit/">Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS)</a> or “Iron Man” project. The suit, which initially looked more like a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201502041017793989/">Master Chief concept sketch</a> from the “Halo” video game franchise, has <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201606011040628352-iron-man-pentagon-spending/">been in development since 2013</a> and, as of February, is nowhere near complete.</p>
      <p>“When we get the exoskeleton here in a few months, we will have the best exoskeleton in the Department of Defense,” SOCOM Acquisition Executive James Smith said at a National Defense Industrial Association forum earlier this year, as reported by <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/2019/02/08/sorry-marvel-fans-socom-says-real-life-iron-man-suit-remains-a-fantasy/">the Army Times</a>. However, he added that the technology required to match the vision of TALOS’ 2013 concept video is currently “out of reach.”</p>
      <blockquote>According to early releases concerning TALOS, it would be constructed with a lightweight, moveable exoskeleton that would prop up bulletproof body armor. The operator of the suit would also have a number of sensors stuck to their body that would monitor their vitals.</blockquote>
      <p>Despite these hopes, Smith clarified that, TALOS is not “something our operators will feel comfortable putting on a close [combat] environment today. So, moving, shooting, communicating in the face of enemy fire — not quite there yet.”</p>
      <blockquote>While SOCOM has yet to present further progress details on the suit as a whole, Hawkins informed the outlet that the service is focusing on "further maturation and testing" on a total of 10 TALOS subsystems - one of which is the Lightweight Polyethylene Armor for Extremity Protection.</blockquote>
      <p>"This is a material that was part of a collaborative effort during the TALOS project, but that's not to say that this [armor] was the only effort," Hawkins explained. "With regards to the services and what they've taken on, there's some crossover ... our acquisition folks go to the same conferences.</p>
