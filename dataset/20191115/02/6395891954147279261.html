      <p><b>PHILADELPHIA (AP)</b> - The University of Pennsylvania has canceled the remainder of their women's volleyball season after discovering what the university calls "offensive" posters in the team's locker room.</p>
      <p>The university announced the decision to cancel the Quakers' season in a press release on their website Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The university says "vulgar" posters were found in team's locker room earlier this week. The release did not disclose the content of the posters.</p>
      <p>The Ivy League school's director of athletics and recreation, M. Grace Calhoun, said the student-athletes' behavior "is simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated."</p>
      <p>Officials say the issue has been referred to the school's administration for further review.</p>
      <p>The team will not be traveling to their final two contests of the season against Yale and Brown this weekend.</p>
