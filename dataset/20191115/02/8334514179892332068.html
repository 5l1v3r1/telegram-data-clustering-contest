      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House budget official Mark Sandy will give testimony in a closed session of the U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump if he is subpoenaed, his lawyer said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“If Mr. Sandy is subpoenaed, he will appear for a deposition this Saturday,” Barbara “Biz” Van Gelder said in an email. House committees have routinely issued subpoenas for witnesses to appear in the inquiry.</p>
      <p>Sandy, a career official of the Office of Management and Budget, would be the first person from OMB to testify before the inquiry after three political appointees defied congressional subpoenas to appear.</p>
