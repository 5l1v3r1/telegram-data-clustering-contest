      <p>Ten stamps feature the characters Count Dooku, Lando Calrissian, Sith Trooper, Jannah, Grand Moff Tarkin, Darth Maul, Zorii Bliss, Wicket Warrick, Poe Dameron, and Queen Amidala.</p>
      <p>Six stamps feature some of the most famous vehicles in the Star Wars galaxy, including a Podracer and Slave I.</p>
      <p>Poe’s X-wing fighter, a Jedi starfighter, the TIE silencer, and speeder bikes also make an appearance.</p>
      <p>All 10 character stamps are exclusive illustrations by digital artist and Star Wars fan Malcolm Tween.</p>
      <p>Philip Parker, of Royal Mail, said: “Once again Malcolm Tween takes us on a journey across the Star Wars galaxy with extraordinary artwork of characters old and new.</p>
      <p>“The stamps are miniature masterpieces and a fitting tribute to mark the end of the Skywalker saga.”</p>
      <p>The stamps will be available from November 26.</p>
