        <b>Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang has praised Hong Kong's "bright" future as the Chinese e-commerce giant prepares to list in the embattled financial hub.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The firm, which is already traded in the US, hopes to raise up to $13.4bn (Â£10.4bn) in its secondary listing.</p>
      <p>That would make it the biggest share sale this year, according to Dealogic.</p>
      <p>The move is seen as a boost for Hong Kong, diluting fears that protests have tarnished its financial reputation.</p>
      <p>The city has grappled with anti-government protests for nearly five months and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-50400338">violent clashes escalated this week </a>.</p>
      <p>"During this time of ongoing change, we continue to believe that the future of Hong Kong remains bright," Alibaba Chairman Daniel Zhang said.</p>
      <p>He described the city as "one of the world's most important financial centres".</p>
      <p>Mr Zhang - who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49644025">succeeded Jack Ma to take Alibaba's top job</a> earlier this year - said the company hoped to "contribute" to the future of Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The company will offer 500 million shares, priced at up to HK$188 ($24) each for retail investors. Shares are due to start trading on 26 November.</p>
      <p>The sale could knock Uber off the top spot as this year's biggest IPO, according to Dealogic data. The ride-sharing firm raised $8.1bn in its New York float in May.</p>

      <p>Over the years, Alibaba has grown from an online marketplace into an e-commerce giant with interests ranging from financial services to artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>The company said the new listing will allow investors across Asia to "participate in Alibaba's growth," as it seeks to tap "substantial new capital pools" in the region.</p>

      <p>The Hangzhou-based firm had originally considered a Hong Kong IPO in 2013, but opted for New York after failing to secure regulatory approval in the Asian territory.</p>
      <h3>Growing unrest</h3>
      <p>The move to go ahead with the share sale in Hong Kong comes after Alibaba reportedly delayed plans to list there earlier this year, amid ongoing unrest and the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>The long-running protests have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50204696">hurt the economy, which has fallen into recession</a>, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50400073">knocked business confidence</a> in the city.</p>

      <p>The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.</p>
      <p>While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform.</p>
