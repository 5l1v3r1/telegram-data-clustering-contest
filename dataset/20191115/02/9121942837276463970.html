      <p>JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Police in South Africa are removing about 150 refugees who the United Nations refugee agency says forced their way into its compound while protesting recent anti-immigrant attacks.</p>
      <p>Friday’s action in the capital, Pretoria, follows one last month in which police arrested and dispersed hundreds of refugees and asylum-seekers, including children, who had camped for weeks outside the U.N. agency’s office in Cape Town.</p>
      <p>A U.N. statement says the group wants protection and relocation to a safer country. They had been protesting outside the Pretoria office for about a week.</p>
      <p>The police action comes after a court on Wednesday ordered protesters to vacate the area and told police to determine who is legally authorized to stay in South Africa.</p>
      <p>The country has seen waves of xenophobic attacks over the years.</p>
