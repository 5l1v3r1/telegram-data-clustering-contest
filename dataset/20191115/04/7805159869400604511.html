      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:15:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/abdulq/" target="_blank">Abdul</a></address>
      <p>The last week just brought to an end the Big Diwali sales frenzy which can be considered the equivalent of Black Friday in India. However, it seems the big shopping spree will continue as Singles’ Day approaches fast. If you’re not yet aware of what it is, let me bring you up to speed on why you should be tracking it. </p>
      <p>Singles’ Day takes place every year on 11/11 and while it started off as a way to celebrate being single, it is now literally the world’s biggest shopping festival. With almost <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/alibabas-singles-day-sets-online-shopping-record-with-31b-in-sales/">$31 billion in retail sales last year alone</a>, the yearly 24-hour 11/11 Global Shopping Festival is now bigger than Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday put together.</p>
      <p>More than 180,000 Chinese and international brands participate in this sale and we’ll be mentioning some of the products that are up for grabs on Banggood that are worth taking a look at. We will also be <b>giving away coupons (can be used 50 times only for each product)</b> to redeem more discount on the deals mentioned below. So, below is the list which we’ll be updating daily. </p>

      <p>There are a lot of cases for the in-demand OnePlus 7 Pro flagship but this one is a rare double-sided case with a curved design. It’s also got strong aluminium alloy frame protection and this means you don’t need to get anything else if you put on this cover. The usual retail price is Rs 1305.</p>

      <p>This is a similar product like the one mentioned above but it’s more of a simpler version and looks slimmer than the one for the OnePlus 7 Pro.

It sells for Rs 1,187 but can be purchased for Rs 927 with the coupon discount. </p>
