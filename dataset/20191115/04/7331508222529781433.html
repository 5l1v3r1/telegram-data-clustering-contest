      <h1>Quincy Enunwa blasts Jets on social media after $27,900 fine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:10:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:10</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Cimini</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a> wide receiver Quincy Enunwa, who suffered a season-ending neck injury in Week 1, blasted the organization Thursday after he was fined for missing medical treatments.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets, Enunwa said he missed two treatments (Nov. 8 and 11) and was fined $27,900, the maximum allowed under the collective bargaining agreement. He called it "excessive."</p>
      <p>"Given everything that's going on around the team I thought this could've been handled so many different ways," he tweeted. "I've spent my time with the team trying to build myself up to be dependable and hardworking so this s--- hurts."</p>
      <p>Enunwa, who is on injured reserve, became the second player to publicly express frustration with a medical-related issue. Earlier in the season, guard Kelechi Osemele was fined for conduct detrimental to the team because of a dispute over a shoulder injury. He wound up undergoing surgery, unauthorized by the team, and was released.</p>
      <p>In his Twitter rant, Enunwa acknowledged that he missed the treatments and should have alerted the team beforehand. He explained that he missed Monday's treatment because he took his wife, a veteran, out to lunch on Veterans Day. On Nov. 8, he "had to handle an emergency in my house." The Jets declined to comment.</p>
      <p>"The biggest reason is hurts is that I'm on IR for the second time in my career and the doctor told me I have a 50/50 chance of coming back to play," Enunwa said. "I shouldn't even have to be in that building being reminded every day of what I can't do.</p>
      <p>"This s--- feels like punishment already and then they FINE me the max. And then want me to continue to do my rehab there and IF I get healthy they want me to play for them after.</p>
      <p>"I'm not writing this for sympathy and never wanted to even say anything, but when multiple teammates are coming up to me saying it's f----- up I don't care to sit on it anymore."</p>
      <p>Enunwa, 27, missed the 2017 season because of neck surgery. He played well enough in 2018 to land a four-year, $33.4 million contract extension. He has received $10 million of the contract. His $6 million salary for 2020 was guaranteed for injury only at signing; it becomes fully guaranteed on the fifth day of the league year.</p>
      <p>Enunwa has 119 career receptions for 1,617 yards and five touchdowns.</p>
