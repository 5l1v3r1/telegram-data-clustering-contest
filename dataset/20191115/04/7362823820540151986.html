      <h1>Protesters hound Brett Kavanaugh with Christine Blasey Ford video outside DC event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:22:18+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:22</time> by <a rel="author">Brie Stimson</a></address>
      <p>Protesters hounded <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court">Supreme Court</a> Justice <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ronan-farrow-very-proud-kavanaugh-reporting">Brett Kavanaugh</a> on Thursday night outside an event in Washington, greeting him with shouts of “Impeach Kavanaugh” and a large screen replaying accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s congressional testimony.</p>
      <p>The demonstration outside the annual Federalist Society gala, where Kavanaugh was a featured speaker, continued a string of public harassment against conservatives in recent years.</p>
      <p>The screen playing Ford’s testimony -- in which she accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teenagers -- was on a truck rolled up to the event by liberal activist group Demand Justice, The Washington Post reported.</p>

      <p>Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegations and was confirmed to the Supreme Court by a narrow margin in the Senate in October 2018, shortly after Ford gave her testimony to Congress.</p>
      <p>“Brett Kavanaugh apparently thinks one year is enough time for the public to forget about his sham of a confirmation proceeding," Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice, said, according to USA Today. "The more of a public presence he asserts, the more damage he does to the court's legitimacy."</p>

      <p>Thursday’s speaking engagement was to be the first for Kavanaugh in front of a large group since he was confirmed, The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/kavanaugh-to-address-the-conservative-legal-establishment-that-championed-his-nomination/2019/11/14/81fb2aa6-0719-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html">Post </a>reported.</p>
      <p>Once inside, Kavanaugh spoke to a more supportive crowd of 2,000-plus attendees.</p>
      <p>"I signed up for what I knew would be an ugly process – maybe not that ugly – but my friends did not," he said in his speech. "And yet in the midst of it all, they stood up, and they stood by me.”</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh added that he is “optimistic about the future of America and our independent judiciary."</p>
      <p>Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society and White House adviser on judicial appointments, said he thought Kavanaugh was teaching the audience a lesson about persistence in the face of adversity.</p>

      <p>“In today’s culture, when you stand for certain principles, you’re going to be attacked, and you need to have the courage to see it through,” he said, according to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/14/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-justice-federalist-society/4195854002/">USA Today</a>.</p>
