      <p>Stars including Halsey and Gigi Hadid have come to Taylor Swift’s defence after she re-opened her row with prominent talent manager Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>In a passionate statement, Swift accused Braun and Scott Borchetta, the founder of her former record label, of blocking her from performing her old songs at an upcoming awards show.</p>
      <p>The pop superstar also claims they are preventing archive performance footage from being used in an upcoming Netflix documentary about her career.</p>

      <p>Braun, whose clients include Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato, acquired Swift’s back catalogue earlier this year when he bought Borchetta’s record label, Big Machine.</p>
      <p>Swift said Braun and Borchetta would only give her permission to perform songs from her first six albums if she agreed not to re-record them in the future and not speak negatively about the pair in public.</p>
      <p>The two men are yet to publicly respond.</p>
      <p>Following Swift’s post, the hashtag #IStandWithTaylor started trending around the globe, with her fans quick to offer support.</p>
      <p>And Swift has since received public backing from several celebrities.</p>

      <p>Pop star Halsey said: “These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear.</p>
      <p>“Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over reacting, You’re barking up the wrong tree.</p>
      <p>“It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her Artist of the Decade.”</p>

      <p>Supermodel Hadid tweeted: “Scott and Scooter, you know what the right thing to do is.</p>
      <p>“Taylor and her fans deserve to celebrate the music!!”</p>
      <p>Australian actress Ruby Rose, known for roles in TV series Orange Is The New Black and Batwoman, said: “This is not OK…”</p>

      <p>BBC Radio 1 Breakfast host Greg James said: “lol @scooterbraun<br/>@scottborchetta. This is embarrassing.</p>
      <p>“Probs should sort this out ASAP I reckon. Also while I’ve got you, the Bieber verse on Bad Guy is an abomination.”</p>
      <p>Singers Tinashe and Todrick Hall also voiced their support for Swift.</p>
      <p>When Swift first publicly rebuked Braun, following the sale of her back catalogue in June, the talent manager’s most high-profile client, Bieber, was quick to defend him.</p>
      <p>However, he is yet to publicly respond this time.</p>
