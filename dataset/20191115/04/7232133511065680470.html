      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few days, ripple mostly followed a bearish pattern below the $0.2800 and $0.2750 supports against the US Dollar. Moreover, XRP/USD settled below the $0.2750 support area and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>The recent decline pushed the price below the $0.2700 support area. A new monthly low was formed near $0.2630 and the price is currently consolidating losses. The price corrected above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $.2749 high to $0.2630 low.</p>
      <p>However, there are many resistances on the upside near the $0.2680 and $0.2700 levels. The first key resistance is near the $0.2690 level. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $.2749 high to $0.2630 low is near the $0.2690 level.</p>
      <p>The main resistance is near the $0.2700 and $0.2720 levels. More importantly, this week’s crucial bearish trend line is active with resistance near $0.2700 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Above the trend line, ripple could struggle near the 100 hourly SMA and $0.2720. Therefore, a successful close above the $0.2720 resistance is needed for upside acceleration towards the $0.2800 level.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.2630 and $0.2620 levels. If there is a clear break below the $0.2620 support, the price may perhaps decline further below the $0.2600 and $0.2550 levels. In the mentioned case, the next major support is near the $0.2450 level, where the bulls might take a stand.</p>
