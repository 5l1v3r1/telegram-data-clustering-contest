      <p>Carlos Beltran has been steadfast in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/carlos-beltran-doubles-down-as-mets-unfazed-over-mlb-sign-stealing-scandal/">saying the Astros legally stole signs </a>during his one season with the team in 2017. A <span dir="auto">new video appears to suggest that </span>the new Mets manager benefited from Houston’s alleged practice, which is being investigated by Major League Baseball.</p>
      <p>Max Wildstein posted video of an August 2017 at-bat with Beltran facing Chris Archer, then with the Rays. Beltran sees five pitches from the right-hander with a runner on first. In the video, a slider brings one audible bang, two bangs for changeups and none for fastballs.</p>
      <p>Beltran, who won the World Series with the Astros, ended up ripping a ball that the first baseman bobbled. Beltran was out at first, but moved the runner to second with two outs.</p>
      <p>Beltran has been consistent in his denial of any illegal practices by the Astros after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/mets-carlos-beltran-played-key-role-in-astros-sign-stealing-report/">a report in The Athletic stated he and Red Sox manager Alex Cora</a>, then the Houston bench coach, played “key roles” in the 2017 Astros’ illegal, electronic sign-stealing operation.</p>
      <p>“I’m not concerned,” Beltran wrote in a text message to The Post on Thursday. “There’s nothing illegal about studying your opposite team. We all have the same opportunity to look out for information and tendencies. I love and respect the game. I will be a student of it and apply all the lessons.”</p>
      <p>Mike Fiers, his Astros teammate, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/former-astros-pitcher-mike-fiers-says-team-electronically-stole-signs-in-2017/">has gone on record</a> saying the club illegally stole signs using a center-field camera focused on the other team’s catcher in Minute Maid Park. Beltran is expected to be interviewed by MLB as part of its investigation.</p>
