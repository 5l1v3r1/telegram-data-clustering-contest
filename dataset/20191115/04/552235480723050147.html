      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-stepping-up-search-missing-20880348">police</a> officer who claimed female firearms cops shouldn’t be on duty without a man has been promoted – despite an ongoing sex discrimination tribunal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-cop-who-made-sexist-20651592">Sergeant Keith Warhurst</a>, who lost his temporary inspector title in the wake of the row, has been promoted back to inspector and moved to a new division.</p>

      <p>His latest promotion comes weeks after the Record revealed he had landed a plum role in roads policing.</p>
      <p>Warhurst, from Edinburgh, sparked furious complaints when he sent an email about officer deployment to colleagues in the firearms department in January last year. It led to one female officer suing Police Scotland for sexual discrimination.</p>
      <p>A source said: “It’s staggering to hear he’s now been promoted to inspector despite the ongoing tribunal. What are they thinking about? At the very least Police Scotland should be waiting until the outcome of the tribunal.</p>
      <p>“What kind of message are they sending out to the rank and file here? Make a complaint which results in a tribunal but we’ll still promote and reward the people at the heart of the complaint?</p>
      <p>“It’s astounding and smacks of contempt over issues they should be addressing – including misogyny, bullying and discrimination – instead of slapping backs and giving career lifts.”</p>
      <p>n September, we told how an employment tribunal heard Constable Rhona Malone fell victim to “institutional sexism” in its firearms unit.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old was sent an email by Warhurst saying she should always partner with a male colleague due to “obvious differences in physical capacity”. Warhurst also allegedly referred to another female officer as a “wee lassie”.</p>
      <p>Constable Malone took Police Scotland to an employment tribunal after a string of alleged examples of sex discrimination. The impact of the ordeal has forced her to seek early retirement on ill-health grounds.</p>
      <p>The force could face a six-figure payout if it loses the tribunal, which is expected to resume in January.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland refused to comment on our story.</p>
