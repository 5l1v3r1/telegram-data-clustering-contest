      <h1>NFL rumors indicate Eagles to host Jay Ajayi for visit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:36:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/jovanalford/" target="_blank">Jovan Alford</a></address>
      <p>With both running backs Jordan Howard and Darren Sproles banged up, the Philadelphia Eagles are turning to a familiar face for some help.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1195184260254257152">According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Media</a>, free-agent running back <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1177669444560211973">Jay Ajayi</a> is visiting the Eagles on Friday.</p>
      <p>This will be the third workout/visit for the veteran running back, who was rehabbing from a torn ACL that he suffered last season with the Eagles.</p>
      <p>The other two teams that worked out Ajayi was the Detroit Lions and Arizona Cardinals.</p>
      <p>Back in September, <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1177669444560211973">Rapoport reported that the 26-year-old running back informed</a> all 32 NFL teams that he is ready for game action and fully recovered from ACL surgery.</p>
      <p>Before tearing his ACL in Week 5 of last season, Ajayi had racked up 184 yards on 45 carries (4.1 YPC) and three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>The former Boise State standout, who was acquired at the NFL trade deadline from the Miami Dolphins in 2017, played an integral role in the Eagles’ offense that season.</p>
      <p>After a disappointing first half of the season with the Dolphins, where he only had 465 yards on 103 carries (3.4 YPC) and zero touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Ajayi had an outstanding second half of the season with Eagles, rushing for 408 yards on 70 carries (5.8 YPC) and a touchdown. The veteran running back also had 91 receiving yards and a touchdown during that seven-game stretch.</p>
      <p>He was the perfect complement/fit in Philadelphia’s running back by committee, which also featured LeGarrette Blount and Corey Clement.</p>
      <p>If Ajayi was to get signed by the Eagles this time around, he could help rookie Miles Sanders shoulder the workload on Sunday against the New England Patriots.</p>
      <p>Aforementioned, Howard was a limited participant in practice on Thursday with a shoulder injury. While Sproles did not practice with a quad injury, which has given him issues before.</p>
