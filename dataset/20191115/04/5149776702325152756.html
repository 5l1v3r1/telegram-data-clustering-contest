        <b>PLAYING HARDBALL</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dundee United will not “entertain” any January bids for reported <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> target Lawrence Shankland.</p>
      <p>Head coach Robbie Neilson says he still expects the striker to be at the Scottish club come February.</p>
      <p>The Reds were linked with Shankland in the summer and it was reported earlier this month that they could rekindle their interest when the transfer window opens again.</p>

        <b>A STEP UP</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna says he will “see what happens come January”, following a failed move to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Reds were among a number of sides who <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/angry-aberdeen-boss-hits-out-3187121">tried to prise away the Scot</a> during the transfer window.</p>
      <p>Forest and Championship rivals QPR put forward offers believed to be in the region of £3m, while Aston Villa were said to have had a bid in the region of £6.5m rejected.</p>
