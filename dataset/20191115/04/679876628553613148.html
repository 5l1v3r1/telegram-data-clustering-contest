      <h1>Ten of the best beach clubs and where to find them</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:29:25+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.traveller.com.au/ute-junker--hve7a" target="_blank">Ute Junker</a></address>
      <h3>TANJONG BEACH CLUB, SINGAPORE</h3>
      <p>Beach or pool? At Tanjong, you don't need to choose; this popular beach club on Sentosa Island offers both. During the week, you will find plenty of families occupying the day beds or sheltering under the cheery yellow-and-white striped umbrellas. Sundays, by contrast, are party time, with a younger crowd savouring the beats laid down by DJs. Tanjong is known for its innovative cocktails: try the lavender-infused bellini.

      <h3>ANHINGA BEACH CLUB, TURKEY</h3>
      <p>They're calling it the Turkish Riviera: that lovely coastline of sandy scalloped beaches stretching out from Bodrum and studded with luxury resorts. Anhinga Beach Club, set on its own private stretch of sand, is reserved for residents of the nearby Six Senses Kaplankaya. The rustic-chic design features stone walls, raffia lanterns and woven-backed armchairs; the restaurant serves up classy Italian dishes such as beef carpaccio. See <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anhinga.kaplankaya">facebook.com/anhinga.kaplankaya</a></p>
      <h3>NAMMOS, GREECE</h3>
      <p>Mykonos has plenty of beach clubs, but there are good reasons why Nammos is still beloved by the likes of Mariah Carey and Leonardo di Caprio more than a decade after it opened. Not only does it sit on one the prettiest beaches on the island; this beach club also has its own mini-mall packed with designer labels. The biggest draw, however, is the villa-like cabanas that come complete with private butlers, seven-course lunches and their own hot tubs. See <a href="https://www.nammos.gr/">nammos.gr</a></p>

      <h3>MOSELEY BEACH CLUB, ADELAIDE</h3>
      <p>What do staff at Australia's first fully-fledged beach club wear? Boardies, of course. Moseley Beach Club will be back for its third season a Glenelg Beach this December. There is no entry fee, although you will have to pay if you want to hire one of the daybeds. With a kids' zone, acoustic music during the week and DJs on weekends, the Moseley is a welcome summer playground. See <a href="https://www.themoseley.com.au/">themoseley.com.au</a></p>
      <h3>GRAND AFRICA CAFÉ &amp; BEACH, CAPE TOWN</h3>
      <p>Just one bay over from the V&amp;A Waterfront, Granger Bay is home to Cape Town's best seaside retreat. Stake a place on the palm-shaded deck or at one of the tables scattered across the sand to watch the sunk sink into the sea. You can order up a metre-long thin-crust pizza or a seafood platter, or perhaps sink a brew at the Beer Bar, its rustic décor inspired by Ernest Hemingway's Cuba beach shack.

      <h3>OMNIA DAYCLUB, BALI, ULUWATU</h3>
      <p>Ready to go glam? Then Omnia, Uluwatu's adults-only club, is the place to go. This stylish venue not only has a dramatic setting atop Uluwatu's limestone cliffs; it also has a superb Japanese restaurant and daybeds perched not by the pool but actually in it. Omnia's most famous feature, however, is its Instagrammable bar, distinguished by a gravity-defying silver cube that floats high above it. See <a href="https://omniaclubs.com/">omniaclubs.com</a></p>
      <h3>FENIX, CARTAGENA</h3>
      <p>Those hammocks strung between the palm trees look inviting, but don't go planning a quiet nap; Fenix is a place to party. A 20-minute boat ride from Cartagena proper, this eco-chic island retreat is built around five hand-woven bamboo domes; even the day beds have been crafted from dead wood gathered in the mangroves. The food is superb: try the crisp-skinned Creole sea bass or the seafood paella. <a href="https://www.fenixbeachcartagena.com/">fenix.co</a></p>
      <h3>COCCARO BEACH CLUB, PUGLIA</h3>
      <p>Talk about the best of both worlds. As well as enjoying the farmhouse-style luxury on offer at Masseria Torre Coccaro, guests can also chill out at the resort's nearby beach club. Relax in a private gazebo, book yourself a seaside massage or take a seat at the oyster bar while the in-house babysitters look after the littlies. A day at the beach doesn't get much better than this. <a href="http://www.masseriatorrecoccaro.com/en/restaurants/coccaro-beach-club-210.html">masseriatorrecoccaro.com</a></p>
      <h3>HEART ISLAND, GREAT BARRIER REEF</h3>
      <p>The Whitsundays' most exclusive resort, Qualia, recently unveiled a new playground for its guests to enjoy: a private pontoon located at the lovely Heart Island. Limited to just six guests at a time, the entire experience feels very James Bond, from the 30-minute helicopter ride that takes you there to the sleek pontoon itself. If you don't want to dive right into those crystal-clear waters, take a ride on the glass-bottomed boat instead. See <a href="https://www.qualia.com.au/">qualia.com.au</a></p>
      <h3>BASIL'S BAR, MUSTIQUE</h3>
      <p>If you're knocking back drinks at Basil's Bar, congratulations; you've made it to what is arguably the world's most exclusive beach club. The private island of Mustique has been attracting A-listers ever since Princess Margaret used to holiday here; in more recent years, the likes of Kate Moss, Mick Jagger and Amy Winehouse have enjoyed a drink here. Pull up one of the rocking chairs overlooking the tranquil bay and bask in the glow. See <a href="https://basilsbar.com/">basilsbar.com</a></p>
