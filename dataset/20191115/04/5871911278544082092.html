      <h1>Odell Beckham Jr. taunts Mike Tomlin, leads to heated confrontation during game (Video)</h1>

      <p>Elephants never forget, and apparently neither does Browns receiver Odell Beckham Jr.</p>
      <p>OBJ must have remembered what Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin had to say when asked about him joining the Browns over the offseason, judging by what happened during Thursday’s game at FirstEnergy Stadium (which wasn’t even the craziest part of the night — no, that was when Myles Garrett <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-bashes-mason-rudolph-with-helmet-insane-fight-erupts-video/">yanked off Mason Rudolph’s helmet and bashed him over the head</a> with it, leading to a crazy fight, which you can <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-bashes-mason-rudolph-with-helmet-insane-fight-erupts-video/">watch here</a>).</p>
      <p>For context, Tomlin yawned when reporters posed the question of how Beckham signing with the Browns would shake up the AFC North.</p>
      <p>As for OBJ, well, he was seen yawning in Tomlin’s direction during Thursday’s game, which led to the two getting into a heated confrontation on the sideline. Both guys clearly had a lot to say.</p>

      <p>If only we had audio of this sideline argument, as many are interesting in knowing what was said.</p>
      <p>At least Tomlin stood his ground, but knew when to stay silent after the game, like when asked about the Rudolph-Garrett incident, unlike Browns head coach Freddie Kitchens, who provided <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/15/freddie-kitchens-has-insanely-stupid-explanation-for-myles-garretts-vicious-helmet-swing/">one of the stupidest explanations we’ve ever heard</a> at the podium.</p>
