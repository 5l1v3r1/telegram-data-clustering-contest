      <p>Iranian authorities have imposed rationing on gasoline purchases and have increased the price of fuel substantially as the economy continues to be hit by U.S. financial sanctions.<br/><br/>The National Petroleum Products Distribution Company on November 14 said a 60-liter monthly limit of gasoline will be set on every private automobile and that prices will go up to about 12.7 cents a liter from nine cents.<br/><br/>Prices for taxis and ambulances will also be at 12.7 cents a liter for up to 500 liters.<br/><br/>After the amount quota amount is met, the price will rise to 26 cents a liter.<br/><br/>Iran continues to have some of the lowest fuel prices in the world, supported by heavy government subsidies.<br/><br/>The country has huge energy reserves, but it is struggling to meet its domestic fuel needs because of a lack of refining capacity. International sanctions add to the problem by limiting the supply of spare parts to repair and upgrade facilities.<br/><br/>Fuel rationing introduced in 2007 under former President Mahmud Ahmadinejad to curb consumption led to anger and violence, including the torching of several gas stations. It was halted in 2015.<br/><br/>Many Iranians had speculated on the possibility of renewed rationing since the United States in May 2018 withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal that Tehran signed with six world powers and began reimposing crippling sanctions, which had been eased in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program.<br/><br/>In May, <b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-ration-rumors-long-lines-gas-stations/29916890.html">Iranian drivers queued up</a></b> in long lines at gasoline stations in Tehran and several other cities to fill their gas tanks amid rumors that gasoline rationing would go into effect on May 2.<br/><br/>Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh denied the rumors at the time, calling them a "lie."<br/><br/>Razmezan Shojaei Kaisari, an official with Iran's Interior Ministry, said on May 2 that a final decision had not been made about "the extent" or "timing" of rationing while adding that the issue was being reviewed.<br/><br/>On November 12, Iranian President Hassan Rohani said the country in recent months has been facing its "the most difficult" time in decades</p>
