        <b>Instagram, which has been running a test to hide like counts on posts in seven different countries, announced today that it is expanding the test globally, introducing it to the US as soon as this week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The accounts included in the test won’t be able to see like counts on other peoples’ posts, but will be able to see them on their posts, the Instagram announcement reads.</p>

      <p>The move is aimed to de-incentivize Instagram users from making posts only for the sake of gathering the most likes. Instagram noted that it is “actively” considering other ways creators can “communicate value to their partners.”</p>

      <p>Instagram’s parent company Facebook is also running a test of hiding like counts in Australia. The test will hide the number of likes on a post, only displaying that a post was liked by “[a friend] and others,” instead of displaying the actual number to the public.</p>
