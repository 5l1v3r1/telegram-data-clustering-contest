      <p>Hulu said Friday it will increase the price of its online cable TV alternative product <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/hulu-boosts-price-of-live-tv-service-in-industry-s-latest-hike">Hulu Live by $10 to $55 a month</a> in what is the latest sign providers are having trouble making money on discounted packages of channels that rival cable. From a report:<i> Hulu Live, which offers about 60 channels such as ESPN and CNN, was first introduced two years ago. The price increase takes effect Dec. 18, the company said in a statement. So-called skinny bundles -- cheaper online alternatives to cable packages -- have struggled recently as budget-conscious consumers seem more willing to just cut out traditional cable networks entirely. Sony is <a href="https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/19/10/29/1956238/sony-is-closing-vue-its-pay-tv-streaming-service-you-never-used">shutting down its offering, PlayStation Vue, in January</a>.</i></p>
