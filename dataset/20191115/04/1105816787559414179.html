      <h1>After Snapchat, Instagram sets to copy TikTok as it unveils Reels</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:47:01+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/6748/tech-desk/" target="_blank">Tech Desk</a></address>
      <p>Facebook meets user demands by creating similar versions of famous apps on its own social media platform, they’ve done it before with Snapchat and this time around they are targeting the popular app TikTok.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/instagram-reels/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a>, Instagram has added a new feature called Reels which is a video tool that allows users to create a 15-second long video with music that can be easily uploaded on their stories.</p>
      <p>Recently, during his speech at Georgetown University, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg raised his concerns regarding TikTok censorship.</p>

      <p>The Reel feature may not have upgraded features as TikTok but it is user-friendly; simply swipe right on the Instagram app and you will find Reel alongside Boomerang and Super-Zoom modes amongst other modes within stories.</p>
      <p>The video can be put up on your story, added to highlights or directly sent to your friends.</p>
