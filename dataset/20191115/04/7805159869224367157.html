      <h1>Google confirms G Suite customers can’t set reminders in Google Assistant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:37:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Setting a reminder or an alarm is one of the first things one does when using the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-assistant/">Google Assistant</a>. It’s the most basic functionality offered by the Assistant and I tend to use it every day. The feature was previously available to all <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-assistant/">Google Assistant</a> users, however, it seems like Google has now removed the functionality for G Suite customers.</p>
      <p>According to a recent question posted on the Google support forums, G Suite users are facing issues while trying to set reminders with the Google Assistant. When asked to set a reminder, the Assistant now replies with, “Reminders are currently not available for G Suite users.” This is rather odd since the reminders feature is quite essential, especially for business users.</p>
      <p>The company has since confirmed that the reminders features has currently been disabled for G Suite users. In response to the question, Google Assistant Community Manager Matt B., said, “As some of you may have noticed already, we are no longer supporting the ability for G Suite users to set reminders with the Assistant as we work to improve the experience. We will update this thread with any new information as soon as we have it.”</p>
      <p>This news was met with criticism from many G Suite users, who took to Reddit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dwh7rg/google_confirms_after_3_months_that_they_removed/f7j7vze?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">vent</a> their frustration. As of now, there’s no further information from the company regarding the missing feature. It’s also not clear what improvements Google plans to bring to the feature for G Suite users. It is worth noting, however, that Google rolled out <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-rolls-out-g-suite-calendar-integration-google-assistant/">G Suite calendar integration</a> with the Assistant earlier this year in June. The feature allowed users to listen to their calendar appointments using the Assistant.</p>
