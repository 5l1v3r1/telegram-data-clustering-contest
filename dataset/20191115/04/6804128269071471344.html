      <h1>Spurs news: Most important player revealed, who Pochettino must sell in January, transfer boost</h1>
      <h2>Spurs news | All the latest from around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</h2>

      <p>Where do Spurs turn next?</p>
      <p>Once the international break is over, Spurs face a run of seven games in 23 days - almost a game every three days.</p>
      <p>It could be a run of fixtures that defines the rest of the season, given how poorly the campaign has started.</p>
      <p>Pick up a healthy number of points in the five Premier League games in that spell and the top four chase could be back on. Continue to stutter and the season may be ended before it's begun.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has work to do on the training ground and here we round-up the biggest stories from around Tottenham in the past 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>Most important player</h3>
      <p>Football is a game of opinions.</p>
      <p>But some opinions are held by a good many people.</p>
      <p>If we were to ask you who the most important player at Tottenham is right now, there would probably be two or three different responses.</p>

      <p>And when we at <b>football.london</b> asked who should be kept and who should be sold in January, we noticed that there were a few names of players that should stay, higher up the chain of command than others.</p>
      <p>And who was right at the top?</p>

      <h3>Harry Kane verdict</h3>
      <p>Harry Kane has not exactly been at his best so far this season.</p>
      <p>But then again, nor have many of the Tottenham players.</p>

      <p>The England captain has six goals in 12 Premier League games this season, not quite up to his usual goalscoring standards.</p>
      <p>But he would walk into Liverpool's team, a team top of the table without defeat so far this season, according to one former Liverpool and Spurs man.</p>

      <h3>Who Pochettino should sell</h3>
      <p>There will be lots of talk over who will leave Tottenham in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Will Christian Eriksen stay and run down his contract, leaving for free in the summer, or will Spurs be able to get some money for him?</p>
      <p>The same goes for Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld.</p>

      <p>Danny Rose has already stated his intentions to run down his contract, so he's going nowhere, but what of the likes of Serge Aurier and Victor Wanyama too?</p>
      <p>We asked the fans for who should be sold in January.</p>

      <h3>Transfer boost</h3>
      <p>Tottenham's plans in the January transfer window will soon become clear.</p>
      <p>There are less than two months now before the window opens again, and Spurs fans will be expecting Daniel Levy and Mauricio Pochettino to be busy, given the poor start to this season.</p>

      <p>And Spurs have been boosted by the news that one of their reported transfer targets from the summer, is ready to leave his club and make the move to a big European club.</p>
