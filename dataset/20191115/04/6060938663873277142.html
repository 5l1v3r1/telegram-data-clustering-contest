      <h1>Prithvi Shaw back in Mumbai's T20 squad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:41:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Gaurav-Gupta-479178426.cms" target="_blank">Gaurav Gupta</a></address>
      <p>INDORE: Mumbai opener, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Prithvi-Shaw">Prithvi Shaw</a>, whose nine-month ban for a doping violation ends on Friday, has been picked in the 15-man squad for the last two league matches and the Super League stage of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy, which will begin in Surat from November 21.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to Prithvi a couple of days ago about his activity. He told me that he was at the National <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">Cricket</a> Academy (NCA), practicing under the tutelage of Rahul Dravid (currently the NCA head). He looks fit and ready to come back into the game. I met him at the ground today too. He's going to Shirdi tonight, and will join the team on Saturday. From 16th onwards, he's eligible to play," Mumbai chief selector Milind Rege told TOI on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"He's a terrific player. We have to bring him back aboard. He's a young man who's scored runs in the past. The past is past, we're now looking at him from his ability point of view," he added. Shaw, who recently turned 20, scored a hundred on his Test debut at Rajkot against the West Indies last year, and was Man of the Match and series in his maiden international series that time, scoring 237 runs@118.50. However, an ankle injury ruled him out of the Australia series thereafter, and his career suffered a huge setback when he was banned in late July by the BCCI for consuming Terbutaline, a prohibited substance, while taking a cough syrup in Indore during the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy in February.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sarfaraz Khan, Raunaq Sharma, Atif Attarwala, Parikshit Valsangkar, Kruthik Hangewadi have all been excluded from the team, as Rege cited a "happy headache" of having of too many options.</p>
      <p>The squad: Suryakumar Yadav (Captain), Shreyas Iyer, Prithvi Shaw (Eligible from November 17), Aditya Tare, Jay Bista, Siddhesh Lad, Shivam Dube, Shubham Ranjane, Sujit Nayak, Shams Mulani, Dhrumil Matkar, Shardul Thakur, Dhawal Kulkarni, Tushar Deshpande, Eknath Kerkar.</p>
