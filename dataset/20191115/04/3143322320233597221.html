      <p>The Lowveld cricketing fraternity is in mourning following the tragic passing of much-loved cricket coach, Sifiso Mahima, in KaBokweni on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Johan Rudolph Cricket Academy coach earned recognition for his dedication to the sport and plied his trade as a trainer at Hoërskool Nelspruit.</p>
      <p>His motto, “It doesn’t matter if you win, as long as you give everything, every time”, still resonates with many who progressed through the ranks under his tutelage.</p>

      <p>According to Janine Cronjé of NHS, his death leaves a vacuum at the school, the academy and the wider cricket community.</p>
      <p>“He crept into the hearts of the personnel and pupils, and everyone at the cricket academy raved about and him and will mourn his passing,” she said.</p>
      <p>“There is a sombre mood at the academy, because Sifiso was an absolute legend here. The impact he had on the children and parents was unbelievable. It will be near impossible to find someone in his class with the knowledge and love for the sport and the children he coached,” said Johan Rudolph.</p>

      <p>The all-rounder possessed an encyclopaedic knowledge of the sport and represented Mpumalanga’s senior team. While he had a jovial personality, his work ethic shone through and he pushed his charges to give 100 per cent.</p>
      <p>Cronjé added, “His passion for the sport was contagious and his love of working with children showed on and off the field.”</p>
      <p>Mahima’s long-time friend and a prominent Lowveld cricketing figure, Idris Nomani, said he was probably the best all-rounder and a first-class cricketer.</p>

      <p>“I knew Sifiso since his schooling days. He initially coached at Uplands College, before moving to Johan Rudolph<br/>Academy where he worked very well with the kids.</p>
      <p>“He recently accepted a position at Hoërskool Nelspruit and retained his position at the academy, which speaks volumes about the hard work he was prepared to put in. Sifiso was also instrumental in setting up Malekutu Cricket<br/>Academy in KaBokweni about 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>“It will not be easy going forward without him, especially in cricketing circles in the Lowveld.”</p>
