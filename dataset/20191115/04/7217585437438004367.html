      <h1>YouTubers must now identify videos that are made for children</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:30:52+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>In an email to creators on Thursday, YouTube revealed that YouTubers must now identify videos created for children using a new audience setting.</p>
      <p>“Starting today, all creators are required to tell us if their content is made for kids in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act,” the company said.</p>
      <p>In the YouTube Studio, creators can now change their audience setting according to how much content is made for kids on a video or channel level.</p>
      <p>Creators can choose from “no” kids content to a “mixture” and even “alot of” content directed at children.</p>
      <p>“We’ll also use machine learning systems to help us find content that is clearly made for kids,” YouTube further said.</p>
      <p>The change comes after the company was fined for <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/09/youtube-kids-fine/">child safety violations</a> earlier this year, where the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that YouTube was collecting user data from children.</p>
      <p>Additionally, YouTube has also vowed to remove <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/08/youtube-to-remove-misleading-family-content-to-protect-children-from-adult-videos/">misleading videos</a> that trick families into watching adult content.</p>
      <p>Though the new audience settings are part of the company’s settlement with the American FTC, the change applies to all creators on the platform.</p>
      <p>“We know this won’t be easy for some creators, and that this required change is going to take some getting used to,” YouTube concluded.</p>
