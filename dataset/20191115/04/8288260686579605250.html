      <h3>Wolves linked with 'keeper</h3>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers have been linked with a move for Olympiakos goalkeeper Jose Sa.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper is a position <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> are scouting with the long-term in mind and Sa, 26, is the latest name to pop up.</p>
      <p>Undisputed number one <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/rui-patricio">Rui Patricio</a> has been better than ever this season but understudy John Ruddy’s contract expires at the end of this season.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear whether Ruddy will continue to play second fiddle at Molineux, while Will Norris is currently on loan at League One club Ipswich Town.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> are watching a number of goalkeepers with the possibility of signing one next summer and Sa is being monitored <a href="https://www.sportime.gr/olimpiakos/olimpiakos-foul-gia-premier-league-o-sa/">according to Greek outlet SPORtime.</a></p>
      <p>It’s claimed Wolves, Arsenal, Leicester City and West Ham are all monitoring Sa, who has a release clause of €15million.</p>
      <p>Sa, who has forced his way into Portugal’s national team to become one of Patricio’s understudies, is also a client of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jorge-mendes">Jorge Mendes.</a></p>
      <p>Mendes plays an important part in Wolves’ transfer dealings due to is close relationship with owners Fosun.</p>

      <h3>City 'interested in Dias'</h3>
      <p>Manchester City are the latest team to be linked with a move for Benfica’s coveted centre-back Ruben Dias, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Dias, 22, has attracted interest from some of the game’s most illustrious names in recent transfer windows and is now a regular in the Portugal team.</p>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers have also been linked with a move for Dias as <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> assesses his defensive options ahead of the January transfer window.</p>

      <p>Manchester United are reportedly long term admirers too, but City’s need for defensive reinforcements is arguably greater. Pep Guardiola didn’t replace Vincent Kompany in the summer and lost star defender Aymeric Laporte to injury early in the campaign.</p>
      <p>And, according to Portuguese outlet <a href="https://www.ojogo.pt/">O Jogo,</a> City are plotting a move for Dias to solve their defensive crisis.</p>
      <p>Benfica’s sporting director Rui Costa has previously admitted Dias could be lured away from the Stadium of Light - but he hinted at a summer deal rather than one in the winter.</p>
      <p>Speaking in September, Costa said: “If he goes away I don’t know: we would like to keep him still and Ruben knows that here we would have a lot of attention.</p>
      <p>“The club has needs to sell to make cash. We will see how the summer market will develop.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Wolves' January priorities</h3>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are preparing for what should be their costliest January transfer window under <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo.</a>   </p>
      <p>Nuno has never been one to splash the cash in January and in two previous winter windows under the Portuguese <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> have spent less than £2million on permanent deals.  </p>
      <p>Spanish striker Rafa Mir is the only player Nuno has asked Fosun to fund in January but Wolves are now targeting players of a much higher calibre.  </p>
      <p>Owners Fosun have already moved to reassure supporters that they are ready to back Nuno in January - but chairman <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jeff-shi">Jeff Shi</a> has also shed some light on the complexities of the modern day transfer market.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17235610.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS198236773-1.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>“We are always ready to invest,” <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/wolves-chairman-jeff-shi-reveals-17178293">Shi said.</a> “Don’t worry about it. If we need to strengthen the squad of course we have the capacity to do that in January. </p>
      <p>“The philosophy of the club is to do the right deal. We don’t want to do something wrong and spend some money on a player who never plays well. You can see some examples at other clubs so I hope we can avoid that. </p>
      <p>“Sometimes the market doesn’t help. For example, in the last window many players who had played well for only one or two seasons were valued at 60, 70, 80 million. </p>
      <p>“I feel a little bit frustrated about the market inflation but we are still working very hard. Our scouting team are working really hard around Europe and the world to find good talent to help us.</p>
      <p>“We are strong and we know where we are maybe a little bit weak, and I keep talking to Nuno about it. I think we will have a good window in January.”</p>

      <h3>Raul keeping illustrious company</h3>
      <p>‘Best in the world, he comes from Mexico’ is how the song goes - and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/raul-jimenez">Raul Jimenez</a> can now well and truly claim to be one of football’s elite.</p>
      <p>A list of the most prolific footballers in 2019 has been revealed and Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Jimenez is keeping illustrious company.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has enjoyed a stunning year helping <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> finish seventh in the Premier League, reach an FA Cup semi-final and his goals this season saw the club qualify for the Europa League Group Stages.</p>

      <p>Jimenez’s form with Mexico has been equally impressive and he scored five goals as they won a record eighth Gold Cup title in July. Jimenez was also named player of the tournament for his superb showings.</p>
      <p>As things stand, Jimenez has scored 30 goals and assisted a further eight in 56 matches this calendar year.</p>
      <p>A combined 38 goals and assists puts him seventh on the list of players with the most goal contributions in Europe in 2019.</p>
      <p>Barcelona and Argentina superstar Lionel Messi is unsurprisingly top of the list with 55 goal contributions. Raheem Sterling (53), Robert Lewandowski (52), Kylian Mbappe (49), Sergio Aguero (42) and Karim Benzema (40) are the other players who sit above Jimenez on this list.</p>
