      <p>If you’ve kept up with Google’s track record of Pixel phones, you probably didn’t expect the Pixel 3 to <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/308338-google-pixel-demand-is-much-higher-than-expected-study-shows/">put up stellar numbers</a>. They don’t generally outsell their closest competition, and ZDNet has broken down Google’s latest phone sales estimates to figure out just how well (read: poorly) the Pixel 3 did.</p>
      <p>According to the rough math, estimates for Pixel 3 sales range from about 8 million to 12 million <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/325010-google-pixel-2-saw-a-holiday-boost-but-might-still-lag-behind-original-pixel-sales/">over an entire year</a>. For reference, Apple sold over 200 million iPhones in 2017, which would be roughly 20x as many phones that Google sold. That’s really not good.</p>
      <p>To compound on this, the Pixel 3 really did get good reviews. It was also available on <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/339740-merger-or-not-sprint-will-soon-start-carrying-google-pixel-phones/">multiple carriers</a> for the first time ever, and Google wasn’t shy about teaming up with those carriers, especially Verizon, to offer some crazy discounts and promotions on the phone. You could get it really cheap not long after launch, which seems like it should be a perfect storm to craft a phone that puts a dent in the Android market.</p>
      <p>But sadly, no, the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/337208-google-pixel-is-the-fastest-growing-smartphone-brand-in-the-us/">Pixel 3 did not sell well</a>. The Pixel 3a seemed to <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/342424-pixel-3a-doubled-q2-growth-google-alphabet/">do pretty well</a> according to some earlier reports, and that could’ve put a damper on any momentum that the Pixel 3 had, but I think that’s a pretty generous excuse. Looking forward this also spells some pretty bad news for the Pixel 4, because while it’s getting some discounts like the Pixel 3, it doesn’t have the benefit of <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345478-google-pixel-4-dxomark/">good reviews right out of the gate</a>. It fell behind the camera curve, and there’s really cool new feature outside of the meh Motion Sense stuff.</p>
