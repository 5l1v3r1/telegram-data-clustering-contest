      <p>Jack, 28, and his 24-year-old fiance Rachel, who line near Dunblane, first met the minister on a farm at Blair Drummond.</p>
      <p>The couple, who run agricultural business JRM Contracting Ltd, were impressed with his pastoral work visiting farms.</p>
      <p>Rachel said: “The fact Chris is a dedicated minister to the farming community is the main reason we asked him to marry us.</p>
      <p>“We took an instant liking to him and thought the help that he offers people in the industry was just so admirable.</p>
      <p>“The way he portrayed God and related the two subjects was lovely.</p>
      <p>“The role he plays in the community is an important one that’s not recognised enough.”</p>
      <p>Rachel, whose in-laws Iain and Sarah Malcolm farm near Callander and Cromlix Estate near Dunblane, said farming can be a “tough industry”.</p>
      <p>She said: “Sometimes people just need a kind ear to listen to their worries which is exactly what Chris provides.</p>
      <p>“It can make the world of difference to people who are struggling.”</p>
      <p>Reverend Blackshaw, 59, said: “I felt deeply honoured to have been asked to marry Jack and Rachel.</p>
      <p>“I feel we have a great friendship with them and their family.</p>
      <p>“I felt very emotional and a great love for them both during the whole day.</p>
      <p>“It was the perfect wedding and we all agreed it was as if we have known each other all our lives.”</p>
      <p>Based at Ayr Mart, the reverend regularly meets with farmers, NFU Scotland representatives, and visits agriculture shows.</p>
      <p>A farmer’s son himself he draws together people linked to the industry like vets, government agencies, livestock mart staff, those servicing the farming industry and estate workers.</p>
      <p>His experience enables him to provide support to those dealing with issues like bereavement, addictions, illness, depression, stress, suicide and isolation.</p>
