      <p><a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lauryn-hill-shares-guarding-the-gates-single-from-queen-and-slim-soundtrack-new-song.1985200.html">Lauryn Hill's <i>Queen &amp; Slim </i>Soundtrack single "Guarding the Gates"</a> was but only one gem from the feature film's musical collection. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-baby/profile/">Lil Baby</a> has also added his vocals to the soundtrack on a single titled "Catch the Sun." The Atlanta rapper's solo single was produced by recognized artist <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/hitboy/profile">Hit-Boy</a> and is a glimpse into the film's unfolding storyline.</p>
      <p><i>Queen &amp; Slim</i> is set to hit theaters on November 27 and follows the tale of a couple, Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith, who are stuck on an uneventful first date. Kaluuya's character ends up shooting and killing a bigoted, violent police officer, so the couple decides to go on the run. The encounter with the cop is played in the media, and the pair is dubbed to be cop-killing fugitives. However, the story follows their encounters with random people who help, and teach, them throughout their journey of freedom and love.</p>

      <p>If it ain't color, what's the difference between you and I?<br/>I'll let you decide or come up with some repeated lies<br/>I'm just tired of my kind gotta be the one to die<br/>Lookin' in the sky, I know you with me, I can't cry</p>
