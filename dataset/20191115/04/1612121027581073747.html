      <p>There are several products that Google <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344623-youtube-music-default-player-android-10/">neglects</a> and abandons, but <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340744-google-photos-is-next-in-line-for-dark-mode/">Google Photos is not on that list</a>. It’s pretty frequently updated with new features and changes, and there are a couple new things on the horizon for the cloud photo backup service.</p>
      <p>The latest version of <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345314-pixel-4-original-quality-backups/">Google Photos</a>, version 4.30, has hints of a new feature that will allow you to manually tag people that exist in your photos and albums.</p>
      <p>Google Photos already has the ability to tag people, of course, and you can remove incorrect tags. What you <i>can’t </i>do, however, is manually tag people that Google Photos misses. It’s pretty good at picking up faces, but nothing’s perfect, which is why having the ability to do it yourself is so important.</p>
      <p>The current version of the app has some lines of code that indicate that the feature will be coming sooner rather than later, and even though these things can disappear before making their way into a stable release, this feature makes way too much sense to dissipate. Keep an eye out for it over the next few releases of Google Photos.</p>
