      <h1>Where Are You?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:05:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/rabbi-reuven-chaim-klein/" target="_blank">Rabbi Reuven Chaim Klein</a></address>
      <p>When three angels came to visit Avraham’s tent, they famously asked him, “Where (<i>ayeh</i>) is your wife Sarah?” (Genesis 18:9). After Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge and hid, G-d rhetorically asked him, “Where are you (<i>ayeka</i>)?” (ibid. 3:9). After Kayin killed his brother, G-d asked him, “Where (<i>ey</i>) is your brother Hevel?” (ibid. 4:9). All three of these words share the same <i>shoresh</i>.</p>
      <p>Two other words for where in Hebrew are “<i>an</i><i>” </i>(I Samuel 10:14, Job 8:2) <i>– </i>with its derivatives “<i>anah</i><i>” (</i>Biblical Hebrew) and “<i>le’an</i><i>” (</i>Rabbinic Hebrew) – and “<i>eifoh</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>Rabbi Shlomo Pappenheim of Breslau</b> (1740-1814) writes that the root of “<i>ey</i><i>“/”ayeh</i><i>” </i>is <i>aleph-yud</i>. Another word derived from this root is “<i>ee</i><i>” </i>(island). An island is surrounded by water on all sides; there are no landmarks one can use to find it. Since its exact location is hard to determine, the Hebrew word for island asks where it is.</p>
      <p><b>Rabbi Shlomo Aharon Wertheimer</b> (1866-1935) notes that “<i>ey</i><i>” </i>sometimes serves to question “if” or “how” something actually exists, and can also mean “which.”</p>
      <p><b>Rashi</b> (to Job 38:4) explains that “<i>eifoh</i><i>” </i>is a portmanteau of the words “<i>ey</i><i>” </i>(which) and “<i>poh</i><i>” </i>(here). The same is true of the Aramaic words for where (“<i>heicha</i><i>“/”heichan</i><i>“</i>), which are derived from the Aramaic words “<i>hei</i>” (which) and “<i>ka</i><i>“/”kan</i><i>“</i> (here).</p>
      <p>Rashi (to Genesis 27:33, 43:11), as elucidated by Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi (1455-1525), maintains that “<i>eifoh</i><i>“</i> can also mean “now” (Isaiah 22:1) or “what/who” (Judges 8:18). <b>Radak</b>, in <i>Sefer HaShorashim</i><i>, </i>evidently follows this approach, as well. Others point out that in some cases, “<i>eifo” </i>is an interjection which serves as a general expression of confusion and astonishment and does not necessarily mean “where.”</p>
      <p>(For a discussion of whether “<i>eifoh</i><i>“</i> with a <i>hey</i> and “<i>eifoh</i>” with an <i>alef</i> mean the same thing, see Rabbi Uriel Frank’s article in <i>Kovetz HaMa’yan </i>[Tevet 5770].)</p>
      <p>Rabbi Wertheimer writes that “<i>ayeh</i><i>” </i>is used when one has no inkling where something is, while “<i>eifo</i><i>” is used when </i>one does have a <i>general</i> sense of where it is.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch’s great uncle, <b>Rabbi Yehuda Leib Shapira-Frankfurter </b>(1743-1826), writes in <i>HaRechasim LeVikah </i>that “<i>eifoh</i><i>” </i>is used for run-of-the-mill “where is” questions while “<i>ayeh</i><i>” </i>is used when someone searching for something is surprised that it is not in a particular place. In other words, “<i>eifoh</i><i>” </i>means “Where is…?” and “<i>ayeh</i><i>” </i>means “Why is… not here?” In the case of Adam hiding after his sin, G-d used a derivative of “<i>ayeh</i><i>” </i>to rhetorically ask why Adam was not in his regular place.</p>
      <p><b>Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg</b> (1785-1865) uses this basic approach to explain why the angels asked Avraham, “Where is (<i>ayeh</i>)<i> </i>your wife Sarah?” Since Avraham was quite weak after having had a <i>bris</i>, the angels expected Sarah to be present, setting the table. So they inquired, “Why is she not here, where we expected her to be?”</p>
      <p>Rabbi Pappenheim writes that “<i>ayeh</i><i>“</i> and “<i>eifoh</i><i>“</i> focus on something’s <i>current</i> <i>location</i>, while “<i>an</i><i>“/”anah</i><i>“/”le’an</i><i>“</i> focus on something’s <i>destination</i>. The Hebrew word for boat is “<i>aniah</i>” because boat does not travel in a straight line. Since a boat’s final destination is not readily apparent by observing its route, one might ask about such a seafaring vessel, “Where is it going?”</p>
      <p>Since time and space are interrelated (in reality and in the Hebrew language), it is quite understandable that “<i>anah</i><i>” </i>can also mean until when (see Numbers 14:11).</p>
