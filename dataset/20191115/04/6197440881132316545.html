      <h1>Google Photos replacing ‘Assistant’ tab with ‘For you’ and ‘Manage your library’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:57:17+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>This month, Google Photos <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/11/google-photos-menu-redesign/">redesigned the “Info” menu</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/02/google-photos-album-sort/">added album sorting</a>. The picture backup and editing app is now renaming the “Assistant” tab to “For you” and moving some functionality into a new “Manage your library” feed.</p>
      <p>Smart suggestions have long been central to Google Photos. This includes automatically compiled albums, stylized photos, collages, movies, and nostalgic moments. Previously housed in the “Assistant” tab, Google is renaming that feed “For you,” though the icon is unchanged.</p>
      <p>Likely aimed at reducing confusion with Google Assistant, this name change comes with other suggestions being moved to a new “Manage your library” feed accessible from the navigation drawer. We first <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/google-photos-4-26-apk-insight-teardown/">spotted this section</a> in early October.</p>
      <blockquote>We’ve moved helpful suggestions like fixing sideways photos and archiving receipts to a new home.</blockquote>
      <p>Leveraging a checkmark icon, it’s a good idea for Google to move non-creative items into its own section as they often clutter up your personalized works. Overall, this Assistant rebranding into “For you” is minor and pretty straightforward.</p>
      <p>As is par for the course, an update to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-photos/id962194608">Photos for iOS</a> today implements the changes, while it’s not widely rolled out on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos">Android</a>. There are already reports (via <i><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/14/google-photos-will-rename-its-confusing-assistant-tab-to-for-you/">Android Police</a></i>) of it popping up for international users. <a href="https://photos.google.com/foryou">On the web</a>, the Google Photos For you tab is already rolled out.</p>
