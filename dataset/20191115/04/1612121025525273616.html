      <p>Canalys has released a retail study that monitors smart speaker shipments, and there are some really interesting bits of information to take away from it. <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/309888-google-home-and-amazon-echo-might-be-the-home-phones-of-the-future/">Amazon</a> has maintained their grip on being the dominant smart speaker brand, and <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/295475-dont-be-upset-android-tv-is-dying-google-cast-is-where-its-at/">Google has seen their shipments fall</a> 40% from last year. Wait, what?</p>
      <p>Last year Amazon was the top–selling smart speaker maker with 6.3 million units shipped in 2018. Google wasn’t far behind, however, shipping 5.9 million speakers. That was a pretty neck-and-neck race, with both of those companies leading the way over everyone else making a smart speaker.</p>

      <p>Skip ahead a year, and Amazon has shipped 10.4 million units, which is considerably more than they did a year prior. Google, on the other hand, moved just 3.5 million speakers, which is a decline of 40%, ceding tons of market share to Chinese manufacturers like Baidu (290% growth) and Xiaomi (almost 80% growth). So what exactly happened?</p>
      <p>Amazon stayed aggressive, and they’ve pumped <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/332859-amazon-announces-a-slew-of-new-echo-devices-to-bring-alexa-to-every-room-in-your-home/">out tons of new speakers and Echo devices this year</a>, on top of running trade-in programs and aggressive promos to continue pushing Alexa into user homes. Google, on the other hand, has <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/320170-google-home-max-takes-on-apples-homepod/">slowed down</a> some of their more aggressive promos. They’ve given away some free <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/318658-google-home-finally-gets-bluetooth-audio-deezer-and-spotify-free-support-coming-soon/">Google Home Minis</a> with Spotify, but otherwise they’ve only just started to refresh that line, and the regular Google Home still hasn’t changed. Just the Mini.</p>
      <p>Is this bad news? Maybe, but not necessarily. Google still maintains fourth place in global market share for 2019, and they have the advantage of having Google Assistant on billions of Android devices outside of smart speakers. Long term, that’s probably more valuable than selling a few million more smart speakers, anyway.</p>
      <p>But if they are worried about Amazon, then they’re not doing much to stem the tide of the Echo being the de facto smart speaker in tons of homes, and that might be a problem in the future.</p>
