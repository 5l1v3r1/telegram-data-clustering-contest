      <p>To commemorate Remembrance Day service recently, Meghan Markle wore one of Stella McCartney’s coats.</p>
      <p>The British fashion designer who also designed Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s wedding reception dress shared a photo of Meghan wearing one of her pieces during Remembrance Day services.</p>
      <p>McCartney later deleted the post after netizens complained that the designer was promoting her brand instead of honouring veterans for the holiday.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/11/stella-mccartney-deletes-meghan-markle-instagram-post-amid-backlash/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=P6Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">Page Six</a> </i>reported that the designer uploaded a photo of Meghan wearing a black-belted coat that she designed while attending Remembrance Sunday services.</p>

      <p>She wrote in the caption, “So honoured to have HRH Duchess of Sussex in our Autumn ’19 coat at Remembrance Day service. x Stella”</p>
      <p>Some netizens complemented Meghan’s outfit, according to the media outlet but a couple of netizens condemned the post saying that McCartney is disrespectful for the event and promoting her designs.</p>
      <p>The post was deleted but McCartney has not responded or commented about the post or the outfit that Meghan wore.</p>
      <p>Meghan is a fan of McCartney’s designs, having worn her outfits a number of times including during the royal wedding to Prince Harry.</p>
      <p>The designer said that she felt honoured and she still is, according to <i><a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/fashion/a22662683/stella-mccartney-not-done-fighting/?source=aw&amp;utm_source=awin&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=The+Independent">ELLE U.K.</a></i> of the opportunity.</p>
      <p>She said Meghan chose McCartney for reasons other than just a beautiful dress and that she is not a difficult client to make look beautiful.</p>
      <p>According to McCartney, Meghan is a women’s woman which made it easier to dress her.</p>
      <p>Meghan looked beautiful in an all-white, high-neck outfit by Stella McCartney when she and Prince Harry appeared for their private evening wedding reception at Windsor’s Frogmore House.</p>
