      <p>A councillor has been accused of driving working people away from standing in elections.</p>
      <p>Councillor Alex White (Upper Yeo, Liberal Democrats)  accused Councillor Clive Eginton (Taw Vale, Conservative) at a meeting of Mid Devon District Council on Wednesday, November 6.</p>
      <p>His comments came following a question from Cllr Eginton.</p>
      <p>He said: “The audit committee meetings held on June 25, July 15, August 27, and October 8 all have one thing in common. Cllr Alex White, Finance Portfolio Hoder was not present.</p>
      <p>“This being despite three of the four meetings being evening meetings. Can I, therefore, ask Cllr White, if and when he intends attending an audit committee meeting for the first time?”</p>
      <p>Cllr White responded saying: “As you know it’s not possible for councillors to attend every single meeting. I think that’s quite obviously tonight. It’s just not possible to be everywhere at all times.</p>
      <p>“If you want to drive working people out of standing as councillor, then you are going the right way about it. If you want to promote people who have jobs and young people into standing on the Council, if you want to encourage others to take the reigns and to stand up for their local communities, then this is not the way to help people and not the way to promote it.</p>
      <p>“I have a 100 per cent attendance record at this Council for the meetings that I have been required to attend. I am extremely proud of that. I work extraordinarily hard as a ward councillor and will continue to do so to represent people. I continue to work extremely hard as a cabinet member for the benefit of our residents here in Mid Devon, and I will attend meetings as and when I can.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Eginton then asked Leader of the Council, Councillor Bob Deed (Cadbury, Independent) if Cllr White should be expected to attend audit meetings.</p>
      <p>Cllr Deed said: “Sadly I am going to respond in a way that I don’t want to.</p>
      <p>“I would be happy after this meeting to sit down with you, and we can go through the record of the Cabinet Member for Finance for the last four and half years, and it might be interesting to see what information that elicits.”</p>
