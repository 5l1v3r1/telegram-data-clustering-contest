      <h2>Councillors feared it would penalise some residents across the district</h2>

      <p>Plans to lobby the Government to bring forward a council tax system linked to property emissions have been rejected.</p>
      <p>Councillor John Downes (Boniface, Liberal Democrats) brought a motion to Mid Devon District Council (MDDC) on Wednesday, November 6, saying: “That this Council should lobby Government to change the council tax scheme to one that seeks to encourage a system linked to emissions.</p>
      <p>“The scheme should be able to vary council tax to overtly incentivise the construction of properties that can demonstrate high levels of sustainability and energy efficiency while acting as a penalty for those that don’t.</p>
      <p>“Methods to encourage investment in retrofitting to existing properties should also be explored, given the largest proportion of housing emissions will come from existing housing stock rather than a new build.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at the meeting, Cllr Downes said: “It is a soft motion, but the point of it is to try and keep our climate change commitment alive. What I am doing is looking at what we do have a responsibility to or what we have control of in this Council.</p>
      <p>“It’s a little thing talking about lobbying Government, and it’s not meant to penalise people who already have houses. If it was to make progress in the future, we can look to improve current stock and then they could get tax reductions.</p>
      <p>“It’s more about this Council taking the lead, looking at things we have control over, and trying to do something to change it.</p>
      <p>“All I’m asking for is to look at this motion with the view of how we as a Council reflect to the public that we do take climate change seriously and are looking at things we have control over. We can’t change business and council tax today, but we can lobby Government, saying we’ve made a commitment to climate change and we want change.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Elizabeth Wainwright (Sandford and Creedy, Green Party) supported the motion. She said: “Writing a letter is a sign or where we’re headed and what we’re aiming for.</p>
      <p>“It’s not about focusing on penalising people but encouraging people and helping fund those who can’t afford to install equipment. You would be quids in on the long-term savings on council tax.</p>
      <p>“It may feel like a tricky thing to get our heads around in this administration in the next three years, but it’s a sign of where we’re headed.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Graeme Barnell (Newbrooke, Liberal Democrats) said the motion would add leverage to ensure new buildings are constructed to the best standards.</p>
      <p>He said: “We need to have the policies in place, and we need to make sure that we take steps to encourage developers in new developments to adapt the best standards.</p>
      <p>“We need to use the tax system, and I think we should be lobbying for that as we have used the tax system many times in the past for similar ends.</p>
      <p>“Lobbying isn’t just about letter writing. It’s about using our best officers with several other councils working in partnership to make sure we make the changes to the tax system we need. Lobbying is a strenuous activity and one we need to involve ourselves in all the time and need to make sure we have the right direction in doing that.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Luke Taylor (Bradninch, Liberal Democrats) added: “The big five developers will not change unless something happens in Central Government.</p>
      <p>“They will fit as many houses into a development as they possibly can. What we’re asking for is that Government looks into it and how we can incentivise developers to want to build new developments that are greener.”</p>
      <p>However, the motion was lost with 17 voting against, and 16 in favour.</p>
      <p>Andrew Moore (Clare &amp; Shuttern, Conservative) said that while he supported the green agenda, there was no need to lobby Government.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think the Government is already aware of the need to encourage carbon-efficient housing stock and the green agenda. Councils like us, up and down the country want something to be done and are actually doing things. I do question whether this is a bit of an empty gesture, but more to the point, is it even a sensible thing to propose?”</p>
      <p>Cllr Moore said that property emissions were unrelated to the council tax of a property and that Central Government would not fund a shortfall if tax breaks were given.</p>
      <p>“For me the principle is wrong. It would potentially expose the Council to cost and risk, it’s potentially unfair and in my opinion, is an empty gesture. There are far better ways from policy change on new builds to its operations for this Council to promote and deliver the green agenda.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Bob Evans (Lower Culm, Conservative) added: “Anything that says penalty for some but reward for others cannot be the right way forward. The motion, as put forward, would penalise people with older properties. That cannot be the way forward, and I doubt any government would support such a scheme.</p>
      <p>“What we need to be doing and what we have a record of doing is action within our authority which we can implement and that we have a deal of control over.</p>
      <p>“Lobbying government is fine; however, the messages coming out loud and clear from a whole host of non-political organisations is that you’ve got to stop talking about this now, and people like all of us, need to start doing something.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Ashley Wilces (Cullompton North, Independent) said he could not understand how occupiers of homes should be penalised depending on how their house was built.</p>
      <p>“I don’t understand how the occupiers of those homes are the ones who should be penalised unless this motion aims to say to people that they will have to pay more to live in a house and thus try to put them off buying one.</p>
      <p>“Surely the way to go is penalising the developers themselves and not the intended occupiers?” </p>
