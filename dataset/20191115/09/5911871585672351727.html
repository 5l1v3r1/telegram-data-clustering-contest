      <h1>Twin Peaks – “Spiders (Kidsmoke)” (Wilco Cover)</h1>

      <p>The Wilco tribute album <i>Wilco Covered</i> was released on CD with the November issue of <i>Uncut</i>, and only one of its songs was released digitally: Cate Le Bon’s album-opening rework of “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2058236/cate-le-bon-company-in-my-back-wilco-cover/music/">Company In My Back</a>.” Hopefully many more of those covers will be working their way online in the coming weeks because today the final song on the comp sees digital release.</p>
      <p>That would be Twin Peaks’ take on “Spiders (Kidsmoke),” which, like “Company In My Back,” originates from Wilco’s masterful 2004 release <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1686803/a-ghost-is-born-turns-10/franchises/the-anniversary/"><i>A Ghost Is Born</i></a>. It’s a roots-rock/krautrock hybrid that sets Wilco’s drowsy pop harmonies and rangy, agitated lead guitar work to a motorik pulse, punctuated by occasional widescreen bar-band explosions. Twin Peaks, Wilco’s Chicago rock descendants, have delivered a faithful reading of “Spiders (Kidsmoke),” one that reminds me how cool it would be to see the track back in Wilco’s setlist sometime soon.</p>
      <p>(For what it’s worth, at <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/wilco/2019/palace-theatre-columbus-oh-7b9d4220.html">the show I attended last weekend</a>, Wilco sounded better than ever. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a more impeccable live mix, the new <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2059238/wilco-ode-to-joy-review/franchises/album-of-the-week/"><i>Ode To Joy</i></a> songs were a pleasing addition to the catalog, and the classics continued to sound extremely classic.)</p>
      <p>Anyway, this is mainly a post about Twin Peaks, so… listen to their Wilco cover below. And if you didn’t hear their recent original “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063430/twin-peaks-our-world/music/">Our World</a>,” check that one out too.</p>
