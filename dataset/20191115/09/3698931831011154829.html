      <p>According to their home page, the RM99 Madrid offer is available for one day only between 9am to 11:59pm on 16th November 2019 Malaysian time. This is applicable for travel from now until 31st March 2020.</p>

      <p>Apart from Kuala Lumpur, AirAsia.com is also offering flights to Madrid from Bangkok at THB 999, from Sydney at AUD 199 and from Jakarta at IDR 333,000 on the same day. If you missed the first offer, there will be a secondary promo to Madrid which provides an all-in return fare of RM499 from Kuala Lumpur, THB 4,999 from Bangkok, AUD 399 from Sydney and IDR 1,699,000 from Jakarta.</p>
      <p>According to AirAsia, you can only book a maximum of 2 passengers per transaction. Since AirAsia does not fly to Madrid, the flights will be operated by a third-party airline under the Kiwi.com network. As usual, promo seats are limited, so you better act fast.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the partnership, AirAsia Group CEO, Tony Fernandes said “We are reinventing ourselves as more than just an airline, bringing to life our vision for airasia.com to be the region’s one-stop travel shop.”</p>
      <p>According to AirAsia.com Head of Airline Distribution, Rajiv Kumar, AirAsia is looking for other ways to partner directly with airlines and companies that complement the carrier’s network and travel services beyond the Asia Pacific.</p>
