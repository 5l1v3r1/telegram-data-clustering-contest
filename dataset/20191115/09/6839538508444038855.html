      <p>Local streets would be transformed into “superblock” community hubs featuring parks, bars and open spaces under University of Sydney engineering student James Kapaniris’ vision for the city’s future. Today his ideas won him the 2019 Lendlease Bradfield Urbanisation Scholarship.</p>
      <p>His ideas, which include turning streets into share zones where pedestrians, cyclists and people are prioritised over cars, have won Mr Kapaniris the 2019 Lendlease Bradfield Urbanisation Scholarship.</p>

      <p>“The key message behind my idea is we need to find all the benefits of urbanisation without the drawbacks,” said Kapaniris, who is studying a Bachelor of Engineering Honours and Bachelor of Commerce at Sydney University.</p>
      <p>The scholarship is valued at $10,000 a year and lasts for the length of the undergraduate degree. Most of the previous winners have also done internships with Lendlease and still work for the company.</p>
      <p>Kapaniris paid tribute to his fellow students and scholarship finalists at Friday’s Bradfield Oration and said he was “really excited” to contribute his ideas to industry leaders while learning from the sector’s finest.</p>

      <p>Growing up in Strathfield, Mr Kapaniris said he has lived the experience of the impact of</p>
      <p>urbanisation on communities — and often longed for a sense of community.</p>
      <p>“My childhood was very different to what my parents told me theirs was like,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I was dominated by the city so it was hard to foster community bonds and it’s important for neighbours to have this.”</p>

      <p>University of Sydney Vice-Chancellor Michael Spence paid tribute to the entrants in the scholarship and said young people were the key to our future.</p>
      <p>“It is a habit of ours to believe in the future,” Dr Spence said at the Bradfield Oration.</p>
      <p>“Mostly we believe in the future because we see the remarkable young people who are going to take this forward.”</p>
