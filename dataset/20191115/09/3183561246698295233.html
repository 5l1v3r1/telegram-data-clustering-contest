      <p>The Samsung Galaxy S10 was released in Febuary 2019 so we're expecting its successor, the Galaxy S11, to be unveiled around the same time again to coincide with Mobile World Congress. As we're just months away from that potential release date, the leaks have started coming out in full swing from battery size to device colour to how models to expect. Let's dig in.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Specs</h3>
      <p>Tried <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/early-galaxy-s11-leaks-suggest-samsung-is-going-huge-on-battery/">Samsung leaker, Ice Universe,</a> has said the S11 is coming with a big daddy battery. Unlike the S10, which came with a respectably beefy 3100 mAh, the S11 is rumoured to be coming with a chunky 4000 mAh battery.</p>
      <p>While a bigger battery means you'll be able to use the device longer, it also suggests the device will be more powerful overall. Another leak from Chinese social media site, <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/alleged-snapdragon-865-leak-glimpse-galaxy-s11/">as reported by SamMobile</a>, shows the S11 might come with the unreleased Snapdragon 865, an octa-core CPU with a reported base clock speed of 1.8GHz.</p>
      <p>Screen-wise, there haven't yet been any major leaks but the S10 series ranged between 5.8-inch and 6.7-inch screens. It's likely Samsung will at least keep those dimensions but it's certainly possible they could push the ante on a bigger screen, especially given the bigger battery size.</p>
      <p>Finally, there's the camera specs. While there's still no word on any camera leaks, Samsung has been working on bigger camera sensors than ever before, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/samsung-reignites-megapixel-wars-with-108-mp-sensor-for-mobile-photography/">reigniting the megapixel wars</a>. With three-lens camera arrays being sported on the new Pixel, the iPhone 11 and Note 10 series, it's certainly possible the S11 will continue the trend or wack on their four-camera array as seen on the S10 5G. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-camera-galaxy-phone-108mp-camera/">XDA Developers has reported</a> it's quite certain the S11 will use the 108-megapixel sensor Samsung's been developing, which is already in use on Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha and Mi Note 10 phones.</p>

      <p>According to Ice Universe, the camera hole punch will be in the centre of the screen, like the Note 10, but it's set to be smaller.</p>

      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>Another prominent Samsung leaker, <a href="https://www.droidshout.com/two-affordable-samsung-flagship-are-coming-soon/">Ishan Agarwal, has told DroidShout</a> Samsung might be planning 'lite' versions of the S10 and S11 series. Details are quite light at this stage but with Samsung already releasing the S10e, a more affordable entry in the series, it certainly doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility.</p>

      <h3>Price</h3>
      <p>In terms of pricing, there's been no substantial leaks but as always, ballpark figures are easy enough to guess. The S10 series, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/02/samsung-galaxy-s10-s10-plus-s10-e-s10-5g-range-australian-price-specs-and-release-date/">on release earlier this year</a>, retailed from $1199 for the cheaper S10e model, $1349 for the entry-level S10 and up to $2399 for the S10+ with 1TB of storage.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-review-australia/">Samsung's S10 5G</a>, released in May, went for $1999. Given the prices vary pretty substantially depending on the model and the storage, we can probably assume the S11 will follow a similar pattern with a slight increase. If the rumours of the Lite model are true, we're suspecting it will replace the S10e and be offered at a more mid-tier pricing range.</p>
      <p>We'll keep updating this article as more leaks inevitably filter out into the world.</p>
