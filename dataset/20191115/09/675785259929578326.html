      <h1>Mohamed Salah injury concern for Liverpool with ankle problem return date unclear</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool are facing an anxious wait to discover when Mohamed Salah will be fit to return from his ankle injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:48:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:48</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool are facing concerns of Mohamed Salah with his return date after an ankle injury still unclear.</p>
      <p>Salah was taken off in the second half of Liverpool's win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and has withdrawn from Egypt's latest squad over the ongoing problem.</p>
      <p>He was pictured wearing a protective boot as he sat out a training session in Cairo before returning to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> for further treatment.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11860813/mohamed-salah-liverpool-forwards-return-date-unclear-after-ankle-injury">Sky Sports News</a> , Salah has been allowed to train away from Melwood to continue his rehabilitation and he will receive an extended period of time off during the international break.</p>
      <p>It is still unclear when he will be fit to return, remaining a big doubt for their next game in the title race against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on November 23.</p>

      <p>Salah has continued to struggle with the injury he suffered against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on October 5 under a heavy challenge from Hamza Choudhury.</p>
      <p>He has since scored goals against Genk, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and Manchester City but is still not back at 100%, leading to him looking to get back to full fitness in the international break.</p>
      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp recently discussed Salah's injury, stating: "I think it is more really annoying - for him, not me - the fact that it always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that."</p>

      <p>Full-back Andy Robertson is also an injury concern ahead of their trip to Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Robertson has pulled out of the Scotland squad for their upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Cyprus.</p>
      <p>The Scotland skipper left Anfield on Sunday, after the 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , with a swollen ankle but had hoped to be fit to lead Steve Clarkeâ€™s side.</p>
      <p>However, the injury has proven sufficient enough for Robertson to withdraw from the Scotland squad.</p>
