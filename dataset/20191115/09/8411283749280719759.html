      <h1>Nvidia announces financial results for fiscal 3Q20</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:08:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:08</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Tsai, DIGITIMES, Taipei</a></address>
      <p>Nvidia has reported that revenues for fiscal third-quarter 2020 (ended October 27, 2019) reached US$3.01 billion compared with US$3.18 billion a year earlier and US$2.58 billion in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were US$1.45, compared with US$1.97 a year ago and US$0.90 in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>"Our gaming business and demand from hyperscale customers powered third-quarter's results," said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. "The realism of computer graphics is taking a giant leap forward with Nvidia RTX."</p>
      <p>Nvidia will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of US$0.16 per share on December 20, 2019, to all shareholders of record on November 29, 2019.</p>
      <p>The company will return to repurchasing its stock after closing the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies. Although discussions with the EU and China regulatory bodies are progressing and closing the acquisition is possible by the end of this calendar year, the company believes the closing will likely occur in the early part of calendar 2020.</p>
