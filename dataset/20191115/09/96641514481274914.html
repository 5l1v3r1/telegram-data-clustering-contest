      <p>Instant Pot deals are becoming almost a daily occurrence. But since we're heading into the heart of holiday shopping season, all of them are worth considering for the culinary wizard on your list. Today, Amazon has the Instant Pot Lux 80 8-quart 6-in-1 model for just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071VCMK97/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=68235806281d0eca1b34ce8b85fa7958&amp;language=en_US">$55</a>. What's more, that's the best price we've seen on this particular model, which typically costs $80. In fact, it's the lowest price ever on the Lux 80, <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B071VCMK97">according to Camelcamelcamel.</a></p>
      <p>This 8-quart model is recommended for families of six or more people, or for someone who enjoys batch cooking or meal prep. It offers three saute modes (low, medium and high), in addition to Egg and Cake cooking presets. And of course, the typical Rice, Slow Cooker and Manual Instant Pot modes are also available here.</p>
      <p>While $55 is a good price, we've been seeing deals on various Instant Pot models over the last few weeks. Those included discounts on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/28/amazon-instant-pot-ultra-price-drop/">the pricier Ultra models</a> and on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/04/instant-pot-duo-red-price-drop-amazon/">the red Duo</a>. However, today's deal on the Lux 80 is the cheapest we've seen across all models over the last couple weeks. And this is one of Amazon's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox/">Gold Box deals of the day</a>, so it won't be around for long.</p>
