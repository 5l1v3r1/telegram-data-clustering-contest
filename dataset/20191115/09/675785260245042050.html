      <h2>The Line of Duty cast have hinted that work on season six is underway - and fans think they've spotted a huge clue about H and Ted Hastings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:36:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:36</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>It looks like it's almost time for our lives to be consumed by the letter H once again.</p>
      <p>As Line of Duty season five came to an end this summer, everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as Ted Hastings was cleared of any wrongdoing and we finally had an answer for who the real corrupt officer H was - kind of.</p>
      <p>Everyone's favourite three-piece wearing copper DS Steve Arnott summoned the power of the waistcoat to decipher Dot Cottan’s dying declaration that there was in fact four members of the force in league with organised crime.</p>
      <p>It left the hit series open for a gripping sixth series and show creator Jed Mercurio recently teased that we may not have to wait as long for the next installment as he aims to get it aired ' <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/line-duty-creator-teases-return-20545633">sometime in 2020</a> '.</p>

      <p>Jed ramped up the excitement to fever pitch on Wednesday night as he tweeted a snap with the 'season six team' Adrian Dunbar (Ted Hastings), Vicky McClure (Kate Fleming) and Martin Compston (Steve Arnott) at dinner as he said: "Nervously awaiting the arrival of secret gust stars."</p>
      <p>As fans carried out their own detective work to try and read the papers left on the table (spoiler: turned out to be a food menu), it was the photos uploaded later in the night which really got viewers in a flap.</p>
      <p>Vicky and Martin both posted photos of the bent-copper-hunting trio, showing Adrian wearing a bright blue jacket emblazoned with the initials HH.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>One fan commented: "Just saying... H on the jacket. Conspiracy theories galore."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Ah, is Adrian Dunbar giving us a clue to the next series? HH on his jacket."</p>
      <p>"He's not H... He's Double H," said a third.</p>
      <p>What does it all mean? Is Ted brazenly flaunting his identity as H after getting away with it? Are two Hs still out there? Is it Kate and Steve?</p>
      <p>Or was it simply a chilly night and Helly Hansen make some pretty snug coats?</p>
      <p>Looks like we'll have to wait until sometime in 2020 to find out.</p>
