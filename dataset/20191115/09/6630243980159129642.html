      <p>Nelson Mandela was from South Africa but his influence was felt on a global scale, little wonder he is classified a global political and diplomatic icon.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday November 14, a statue of the former South African president was unveiled in the Cuban capital, Havana.</p>
      <p>In his lifetime, Mandela lauded the Cuban revolution as an “inspiration to all freedom-loving people” and was a supporter of former president Fidel Castro.</p>
      <aside>It will be a place where heads of state, African delegations, will be paid tribute to. These leaders fought for the unity of the African continent, for its independence.</aside>
      <p>Leader of the Cuban institution of friendship with peoples, Fernandez Gonzales, said duting the unveiling: “For us it is a very special moment, we had been waiting a long time for the bust here.</p>
      <p>“It will be a place where heads of state, African delegations, will be paid tribute to. These leaders fought for the unity of the African continent, for its independence.”</p>
      <p>As president of Cuba, the late Fidel Castro gave the African National Congress, South Africa’s liberation movement turned ruling party, military support in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, Cuba sent hundreds of thousands of soldiers to fight in Angola which weakened the government of South Africa and helped Mandela’s anti-apartheid cause.</p>
      <p>After his release from prison in 1990, Mandela travelled to Cuba in July 1991, saying the writings of Che Guevara served as inspiration to him throughout his 27-year imprisonment.</p>
