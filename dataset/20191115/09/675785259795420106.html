      <p>Manchester City are set to avoid Champions League expulsion - as UEFA are finding it too expensive to enforce their own rules.</p>
      <p>City, who won a domestic treble during the 2018-19 season, face expulsion from Europe's top club competition due to a potential breach of Financial Fair Play rules.</p>
      <p>The Premier League club were referred to UEFA's Club Financial Control Body's adjudicatory chamber by chief investigator Yves Leterme following a probe into financial irregularities.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1377968/2019/11/14/exclusive-manchester-city-set-to-avoid-champions-league-ban/">The Athletic</a> , UEFA are struggling to enforce their Financial Fair Play regulations.</p>

      <p>It means City will seemingly escape a big punishment and will be able to continue to compete in Europe's elite club competition.</p>
      <p>It was claimed in the summer that the club were challenging the governing body's right to send the case to their adjudicatory chamber for a ruling to be made.</p>
      <p>A report claimed that City believe there is "no case to answer and are contesting the "legitimacy and haste of the investigation".</p>
      <p>UEFA formally opened the investigation in March following a series of leaks into their financial conduct published in German outlet Der Spiegel.</p>

      <p>If found guilty, the Premier League side face a ban from the Champions League, most likely in the 2020-21 campaign.</p>
      <p>However, it is thought that UEFA's adjudicatory chamber will delay making a judgement on the case until CAS has made a ruling on the validity of its attempts to do so.</p>
      <p>Although City have yet to make a comment, the Abu Dhabi-owned club have previously denied claims of wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>"The accusation of financial irregularities remains entirely false and the CFCB IC referral ignores a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence provided by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> FC to the Chamber," the club said in a statement last month.</p>
      <p>"The decision contains mistakes, misinterpretations and confusions fundamentally borne out of a basic lack of due process and there remain significant unresolved matters raised by Manchester City FC as part of what the Club has found to be a wholly unsatisfactory, curtailed, and hostile process."</p>
