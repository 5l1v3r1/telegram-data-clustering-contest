      <h2>Tina McCue has battled vascular disease and kidney failure due to being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes as a child</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:39:06+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:39</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Ault, Lila Randall</a></address>
      <p>A bride-to-be who awoke after a routine operation to find both legs amputated is set on walking down the aisle on her wedding day.</p>
      <p>Tina McCue was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes as a child causing her to suffer vascular disease.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-four had “battled” with the disease her whole life and was scheduled for an operation to correct the narrowing of the veins in her legs.</p>
      <p>But when Tina was admitted to Royal Stoke University Hospital, surgeons found a serious infection, reports <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/i-want-walk-down-aisle-3525899">Stoke Sentinel</a> .</p>
      <p>They were left with no choice but to amputate both limbs immediately - leaving Tina to learn of the drastic decision only after the operation.</p>

      <p>Tina, aged 37, said: “At first I thought it was just a bad dream, that something had gone wrong and I was in a coma, but that I would wake up and still have my legs. That’s how I started thinking.</p>
      <p>“Then reality kicked in. I was devastated. At first I was thinking, ‘I don’t see any point’, I would be better off dying. That was just a really bad time. The pain was horrendous.</p>
      <p>“But now I  know I can do it. I’ve got to learn to live with it.</p>
      <p>However, the health ordeal isn’t over for Tina, as the former barmaid is waiting for a kidney and pancreas transplant after the condition led to their failure.</p>
      <p>Tina is being supported by her partner, Martyn Pritchard, and her children, Jordan, 18, Ryan, 16, Scott, 12, and Tiffany, 11.</p>

      <p>She added: “I know I have got Martyn and there’s nothing he wouldn’t do for me, and I’m so proud of my children, because it must be hard for them.”</p>
      <p>Family and friends have rallied their support and are raising funds to adapt their home for when Tina is ready to leave hospital.</p>
      <p>On a Just Giving fundraising page, friends described Tina, who was their former hospitality colleague, as ‘never one to complain’ despite being burdened with health issues.</p>
      <p>The group are also planning to host future fundraising events to help lessen the financial strain on the family and to enable Tina live as comfortably as possible, they wrote.</p>
      <p>Martin, 37, praised the community support the family have received so far.</p>
      <p>He said: “The communities of Milton and Baddeley Green are just fantastic. The support has been incredible. Tina is doing really well.”</p>

      <p>Tina’s cousin, Samantha Dudley, said she first heard of diabetes type one when she was a young child and Tina was diagnosed.</p>
      <p>She said: “A day in the life of a type one diabetic is not easy. I call it the forever diet because you have to carbohydrate count every meal and then give yourself a dose of insulin based on this calculation.</p>
      <p>“When I first visited Tina in hospital, all she wanted was for my children to be okay, which just shows how she always  puts other people first.</p>
      <p>“She’s such a wonderfully big-hearted person.”</p>
      <p>The Just giving page has wracked up £126 to date and in total loved ones have raised £1500 for home modifications including a downstairs toilet and a wet room.</p>
