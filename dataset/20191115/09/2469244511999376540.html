      <p>Cabinet members have refused to answer whether or not they are supporters of Extinction Rebellion.</p>
      <p>At a Mid Devon District Council meeting on Wednesday, November 6, Councillor Clive Eginton (Taw Vale, Conservative) said: “Given decisions made on the Devon Climate Declaration at the meeting of Full Council in June 2019, could the members of the Cabinet give me a simple yes or no answer as to whether they support Extinction Rebellion?”</p>
      <p>Councillor Dennis Knowles (Lowman, Independent) was the only Cabinet member to answer the question, responding “no”, before Councillor Ashley Wilces (Cullompton North, Independent)  interjected.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think that’s an appropriate question for members to be answering it’s not for them to give their views on those matters,” he said. “They’re entitled to their private lives.”</p>

      <p>Councillor Les Cruwys (Cranmore, Liberal Democrat) added: “I don’t see the relevance any more than what they’re buying their wives for Christmas.</p>
      <p>“In a way, I would rather that question was asked to everybody. I’m quite happy to tell you my views, but I don’t see it being used as a tool against the members.”</p>
      <p>And Elizabeth Wainwright (Sandford and Creedy, Green Party) said: “My concern in that in that question is the conflation, and presuming what you’re going to go on to explore, and I presume conflation of Extinction Rebellion and possible other green things.</p>
      <p>“I have to remind people often that Extinction Rebellion is not the green movement. They are a single group.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Eginton said that he asked the question because: “Members of the public need to know in terms of the green agenda that this authority is following as regards to the personal views of the Cabinet members. That’s all it is; I’m not asking for any justification, just a simple yes or no answer.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Slade (Lowman, Conservative) added: “I think they should answer the question because every report which goes to every policy development group and onwards to cabinet now has on it it’s relevance to climate change.</p>
      <p>“The Cabinet are our ultimate decision-makers on climate change policy, and we need to know whether they may be influenced by the pressure put upon them by outside lobbying groups.”</p>
      <p>Leader of the Council, Councillor Bob Deed (Cadbury, Independent) said the discussion had little relevance and suggested Cllr Eginton could speak to members following the meeting to get an indication whether they supported Extinction Rebellion or not.</p>
