      <p>It has been reported Bianconeri sporting director Fabio Paratici has flown to England, where he is set to have transfer discussions with the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>According to<i> La Stampa</i>, Paratici will hold talks with United over the potential sale of striker Mario Mandzukic, who has been tipped to join the Premier League club for a fee of about £13 million (R249 million).</p>
      <p>The Croatian has not played a single minute under manager Maurizio Sarri in Italy this season, and is keen to leave the Serie A giants in search of regular game time.</p>

      <p>United's chiefs could also reportedly discuss a transfer for 21-year-old centre-back Merih Demiral, who has played just once for the Italian giants since his arrival at the start of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils reportedly had scouts watch the defender when he played for Turkey against Iceland in a 2020 European Championship qualifier on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Demiral has been capped 11 times for his country since his debut a year ago, and is highly rated, but has been down the pecking order at Juve, with Matthijs de Ligt joining later in the recent transfer window.</p>
