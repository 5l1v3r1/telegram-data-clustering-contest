      <h1>Jakarta to limit e-scooter use from 5am to 11pm, enforce minimum age rule: official</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:00:49+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>It seems like a fatal collision and damages to public property won’t lead to an outright ban on e-scooters in Jakarta, but the city administration is drafting up regulations on the personal mobility devices that would limit who would be allowed to use them and when.</p>
      <p>Syafrin Liputo, head of Jakarta’s Transportation Agency, said that the e-scooter regulations will likely be enforced in December, pending approval from Governor Anies Baswedan. But Syafrin has already outlined some of the regulations’ main points that would likely be enforced.</p>
      <p>“The scooters are available for rent like a transportation vehicle, so we will regulate their operations like that of other public transportation modes, that is with operation hours from 5am to 11pm,” <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/4785531/dishub-dki-akan-atur-waktu-sewa-skuter-listrik-pukul-0500-2300-wib">Syafrin told </a><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/4785531/dishub-dki-akan-atur-waktu-sewa-skuter-listrik-pukul-0500-2300-wib"><i>Detik</i></a><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/4785531/dishub-dki-akan-atur-waktu-sewa-skuter-listrik-pukul-0500-2300-wib"> today</a>.</p>
      <p>“For minimum age, we see that, on average, one can ride a bike when they’re 15. So we will prohibit [the use of e-scooters] for those under 15.”</p>

      <p>Ride-hailing app Grab, which operates the e-scooter-for-rent service GrabWheels, says it’s ready to comply with any government regulations on the electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>GrabWheels was launched<a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/grab-launches-indonesias-first-e-scooter-sharing-service-grabwheels-available-in-bsd-city/"> earlier this year</a> to become the first e-scooter-for-rent service in Indonesia. It quickly became popular among youths in Jakarta and Tangerang — mostly for recreational purposes — before officials were able to draft regulations on them.</p>
      <p>Recently, the Jakarta Transportation Agency issued<a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4782475/dilarang-di-trotoar-jpo-skuter-listrik-boleh-pakai-jalur-sepeda?single=1"> a ban on e-scooters on public facilities</a> such as pedestrian bridges, sidewalks, as well as car-free day on Sudirman-Thamrin every Sunday – but users are allowed to ride on the city’s<a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/dont-cross-the-line-drivers-entering-jakartas-dedicated-bike-lanes-may-be-fined-idr500k/"> bicycle lanes</a>.</p>
