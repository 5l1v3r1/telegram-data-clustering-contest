      <p>James Corden paid an emotional tribute to those affected in Thursday’s Santa Clarita, California, shooting.</p>
      <p>The horrific incident took place at Saugus High School and saw two students get killed and several injured.</p>
      <p>The host said on “The Late Late Show”: “We’re horrified that another place of innocence, learning, and education has become instead a site of violence and trauma.</p>
      <p>“Our hearts break for the families, they really do.”</p>

      <p>Corden then said of the politicians who have failed to do anything despite the countless shootings in the U.S.: “Whilst we continue to elect politicians without the moral courage to address gun laws, these tragedies are destined to keep repeating themselves.</p>
      <p>“Tonight, we grieve for the families of the victims and the community that’s been shattered. Tonight, we send our love to Santa Clarita.”</p>
