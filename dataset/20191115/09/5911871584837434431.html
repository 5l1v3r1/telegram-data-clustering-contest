      <h1>Watch Sleater-Kinney Give Their First Late-Night Performance Without Janet Weiss On <i>Corden</i></h1>

      <p>Back in June, Sleater-Kinney played “Hurry On Home,” the first single from their just-announced St. Vincent-produced album <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2054809/sleater-kinney-the-center-wont-hold-review/franchises/premature-evaluation/">The Center Won’t Hold</a></i>, <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2048438/watch-sleater-kinneys-colossal-performance-of-hurry-on-home-on-the-tonight-show/news/">on <i>The Tonight Show</i></a>. As it turned out, this would be their final performance with longtime drummer Janet Weiss, who <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2049757/janet-weiss-leaves-sleater-kinney/news/">left the band</a> a week and a half later. And last night, Sleater-Kinney played their first late-night performance without Weiss.</p>
      <p>A lot has happened with Sleater-Kinney since that <i>Tonight Show</i> performance and since Weiss’ departure. They’ve put out <i>The Center Won’t Hold</i>, given a bunch of interviews, recruited touring drummer Angie Boylan from the band Freezing Cold, and played a lot of shows. (I can say from personal experience that <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2057329/sleater-kinney-new-drummer-concert-review/franchises/sounding-board/">they still kick ass live</a>.) Last night, as musical guests on James Corden’s <i>Late Late Show</i>, the played the <i>Center Won’t Hold</i> track “Can I Go On” and gave most of the world its first look at the post-Weiss version of the band.</p>
      <p>These days, Sleater-Kinney have a fairly glammy stage setup — backing musicians, fancy outfits, lots of things that light up. But the tense chemistry between Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker is still what it always was. “Can I Go On” is mostly a Carrie Brownstein song, but last night’s performance hit its peak on the bridge, when Corin Tucker delivered a few lines in a weird hiccup-grunt voice and then let loose with one of her inimitable howls, then paused to smile at the crowd’s reaction. Watch it all happen below.</p>
