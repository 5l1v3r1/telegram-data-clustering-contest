      <h1>Ntseki: It Was Not Like We Were Outplayed</h1>

      <p>Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki disputed that his men were no match for Ghana in their opening 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier away in Cape Coast on Thursday night, a match in which the Black Stars ran out 2-0 victors.</p>
      <p>The home side enjoyed the lion’s share of the possession and made it count, managing to get two well-taken goals from Thomas Partey and Mohammed Kudus from a total of 13 shots, while South Africa hardly troubled goalkeeper Richard Ofori.</p>

      <p>“I am still confident in my players even though we lost 2-0 and I feel the game was more balanced. They (Ghana) had more power and strength in getting the goals,” Ntseki told reporters after the game.  </p>
      <p>“It was not like we were outplayed in the situation where we conceded. It happens in the game of football – when you are not balanced the opponent will take advantage.”</p>
      <p>Ntseki said the match was decided on thin margins.</p>
      <p>“When you are playing a game like this, everything is flowing very fast and you look for opportunities where you can hurt your opponent. The two teams were very compact. If you look at Ghana, they didn’t even have too many shots on goal, except from the goal from Thomas – and the second goal came from a transition, winning the ball when we were open at the back. They had possession but never hurt us,” the Bafana coach argued.</p>
      <p>South African will face Sudan on Sunday in their second qualifier of Group C hoping to end the year on a high and give Ntseki his first win.</p>
