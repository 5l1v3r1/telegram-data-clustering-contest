      <p>A Scottish <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/universities-and-colleges">university</a> has recalled students on exchange programmes in Hong Kong as civil unrest continues.</p>
      <p>The University of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> has asked the 21 students affected to return to the UK as soon as they can.</p>
      <p>Anti-government protests have been raging in Hong Kong for months, and students and other protesters have taken over major campuses, building barricades and stockpiling petrol bombs and other weapons.</p>
      <p>The Chinese University of Hong Kong has suspended classes for the rest of the year, and others have asked students to switch to online learning.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the University of Edinburgh said: "The suspension of classes at educational institutions in Hong Kong has affected 21 Edinburgh students, who are currently on exchange there.</p>
      <p>"We are therefore requesting that all of our students in Hong Kong return to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/">UK</a> , at their earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p>"We are providing advice and support to each affected student to ensure all are in a position to return to the UK."</p>
      <p>Last month the University of Edinburgh recalled all nine of its students studying in Egypt, after two were detained by authorities.</p>
      <p>They have since been released but the university advised all of its students in the country to return home, citing concerns for their safety.</p>
