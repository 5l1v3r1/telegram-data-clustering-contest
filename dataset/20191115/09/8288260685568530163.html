      <p>Director of rugby Adam Balding says he ‘doesn’t care how’ Birmingham Moseley get the win this weekend, as long as though they emerge victorious. The Red and Blacks, who have dropped to seventh in National League One, welcome the division’s fourth-from-bottom side Cambridge to Billesley Common.</p>
      <p>“I’m 100 per cent confident going into this weekend” said Balding. “I mean, we’re at home, that has to account for something, we’ve got to make sure we get a win. I don’t care how that win comes, we need to chalk off another victory at home, which would be fantastic.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Cambridge will be a physical challenge as they have quite an expansive team, but it’s imperative we continue our unbeaten record at home.” Despite Moseley having the best home record in the league, with five out of five victories, Balding isn’t getting too ahead of himself.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never spoken about promotion, even when I first took to my role,’’ he said. “This year is about stability and consistency and just making sure we start to develop a culture which we can then build on.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“These things take time, if promotion presented itself clearly then we would jump on it, but we’ve got a lot of hard work to do well before we even start thinking about that. “All we can do is focus on these next couple of games and see where we’re at come Christmas time.”</p>
      <h3>"We didn’t quite fulfil the targets we set ourselves"</h3>
      <p>Moseley suffered a 19-7 defeat to Plymouth last time out but it is only the second game this season where they haven’t managed to come away with any league points. “I’ve never worried about a defeat because I know how hard the lads work,” continued Balding. “I was disappointed because for 60 minutes of the game we probably were the better team.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We just had a very damaging final 20 minutes of the first half where we lost a player to the sin-bin and conceded 19 points, but apart from that, we kind of controlled the game. “It was just frustrating because the lads worked so hard during the week to prepare for what was always going to be a very physical encounter down at Plymouth. We didn’t let ourselves down but we didn’t quite fulfil the targets we kind of set ourselves for that game.</p>
      <p>“The biggest thing about sport is you always get another chance next week to rectify it.” <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/moseley-rfc">Balding is adamant he</a> wouldn’t change anything from his losing side. “Sport is a simple game. It’s based around emotion and the simple things like physicality and workrate,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a great group of lads, they’re humble, they all work hard for each other and we don’t get carried away with the short term, we always look at the bigger picture. “We expect to turn up at home on Saturday and good give a good account of ourselves because if we do that, the result will take care of itself.’’</p>
