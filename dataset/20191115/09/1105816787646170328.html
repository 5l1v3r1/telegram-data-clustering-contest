      <p>He and Kareena were also seen partying with the cast and crew of the film, celebrating the commencement of the shoot.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his character earlier, Aamir previously said, “This character is very lovable. He’s so innocent. He has got this different way of looking at things. He is someone you immediately empathise with when you connect.” He quipped, “Unless I perform it badly, then it’s a different game. As a written character, it’s such that you’d fall in love with him straightaway.”</p>
