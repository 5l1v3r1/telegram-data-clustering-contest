        <b>The iconic sound of the original Nintendo Game Boy is as popular as ever. In fact, it’s formed the basis of a new free VST/AU plugin, GB DrumBox.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A co-production between Bedroom Producers Blog and SampleScience, this contains 12 drum kits, each of which is based on a set of eight Game Boy samples. You can adjust the volume, pan and decay time for each channel, with global controls for filter cutoff, reverb level, attack time and modulation.</p>
      <p>Throw in multiple outputs and you’ve got what’s described as a “fun instrument”, but one that chiptune lovers might actually find rather useful.</p>
      <p>GB DrumBox is available now for PC and Mac in VST/AU formats. You can download it now from <a href="https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2019/11/14/gb-drumbox/"><u>Bedroom Producers Blog</u></a>.</p>
