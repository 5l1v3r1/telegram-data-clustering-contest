      <p>Koei Tecmo has released a new trailer looking at the mythological mayhem that awaits in Omega Force's <i>Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate</i>, a revamped edition of last year's hack 'n' slash adventure.<br/><br/>Rather than focus on a single character, as previous trailers have done, the new video is a general overview of the whole game, looking at some of the new and returning legends headed to <i>Orochi 4</i>'s mammoth roster of over 170 characters. These include <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../hades-is-looking-kinda-fly-in-warriors-orochi-4-ultimate-569122.phtml">Hades</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../warriors-orochi-4-ultimate-trailer-introduces-earth-mother-goddess-gaia-568010.phtml">Gaia</a>, and Yang Jian, alongside guest stars such as <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>'s Ryu Hayabusa and <i>Bladestorm</i>'s Joan of Arc, among others.</p>

      <p>But these new warriors are just the start, as <i>Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate</i> will also include a plethora of new content, including skins, story scenarios, side-quests, which will all add up to make the definitive <i>Warriors Orochi 4</i> experience. So sharpen your blade, because there's another army of hapless soldiers to cleave through.<br/><br/><i>Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate</i> launches in Japan on PS4 and Switch December 19. It will then head west - adding ports for Xbox One and PC ports - on February 14.</p>
