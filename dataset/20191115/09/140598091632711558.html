      <h1>Disgraceful scenes in NFL as Cleveland's Myles Garrett rips helmet off Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph and attacks him with it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:35:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters News Agency</a></address>
      <p>A violent incident marred the end of the NFL game between Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday when Cleveland's defensive end, Myles Garrett, ripped the helmet off Pittsburgh's young quarterback Mason Rudolph and used it to strike Rudolph on the head.</p>
      <p>Commentators were aghast, with Fox pundit Joe Buck describing the incident as "one of the worst things I've ever seen on a professional sports field".</p>
      <p>Garrett was ejected after the ensuing melee, with just eight seconds left in the game and Cleveland already assured of the victory. Garrett now faces a multi-game suspension by the league.</p>
      <p>The incident started when Garrett tackled Rudolph well after the quarterback had thrown the ball.</p>
      <p>Rudolph, however, was not happy, and grabbed at Garrett's helmet. Garrett then did likewise and managed to rip Rudolph's off his head before using it to strike the quarterback.</p>

      <p>Pittsburgh players were incensed. Centre Maurkice Pouncey threw a couple of punches at Garrett, before trying to kick him in the head after he was wrestled to the ground.</p>
      <p>"Oh gosh. Oh my goodness," Buck said as he watched a slow-motion replay of the incident.</p>
      <p>Garrett and Pouncey were ejected, as was another Cleveland player, Larry Ogunjobi.</p>

      <p>Rudolph did not appear to be seriously injured by the helmet strike.</p>
      <p>Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield refused to defend his teammate's behaviour. "I didn't see why it started but it's inexcusable," Mayfield, referring to Garrett, told Fox. "I don't care, rivalry or not, we can't do that.</p>
      <p>"That's just endangering the other team. He's going to get suspended. We don't know how long and that hurts our team."</p>
      <p>Cleveland won the game 21-7, improving to 4-6 for the season, while the Steelers dropped to 5-5.</p>
      <p>The teams meet again in 17 days time.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>NFL.com</i>, a regretful Garrett said: "I made a mistake, I lost my cool and I regret it. It's going to come back to hurt our team. I appreciate my team having my back but it should've never gotten to that point. It's on me.</p>
      <p>"A win's a win. I don't think it was overshadowed by what happens in eight seconds. What we did on the opening 59 minutes should not go unnoticed.</p>
      <p>"It was embarrassing. What I did was foolish and I shouldn't allow myself to slip like that. It was out of character, but it was a situation like that, it is an emotional game, and I allowed myself to follow through those emotions.</p>
      <p>"I've hurt the whole team with what I did and could come back to hurt us. I don't know what sort of repercussions I will face but it's got to be better."</p>
      <p>Rudolph tried to defer from answering questions surrounding the incident in his post-match press conference but did describe Garrett's actions as "cowardly".</p>
      <p>He said: "I thought it was pretty cowardly. I got sacked, we exchanged some words, he kept keeping on and one thing led to another.</p>
      <p>"You can go back and watch the tape if you want and make your own assumptions." </p>
