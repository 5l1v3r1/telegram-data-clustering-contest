        <b>LAURA Anderson has revealed herself as a Rangers fan - and begged for tickets to next month's Old Firm cup final.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Scots Love Island star put out an appeal for tickets for the Betfred Cup clash with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> at Hampden, because she's "Simply The Best".</p>

      <p>She said: "I'm back in Glasgow start of December, it's a long shot but can anyone help me out with a ticket for the cup final?</p>
      <p>"For the good end obviously. Because I'm Simply The Best".</p>
      <p>Laura's <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> will face their arch rivals in the final after beating Hearts 3-0 in the semi-final.</p>
      <p>Celtic won 5-2 against Hibs.</p>
      <p>We told this morning how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4956486/rangers-tax-ebt-hmrc/">HMRC hit back at claims they were responsible for Rangers</a> going bust - after a bombshell report stated up to £50million could be wiped from the club's tax bill.</p>
      <p>In a tweet last night they insisted they "didn't miscalculate anything" and won the case in the Supreme Court.</p>

      <p>The shock report in The Times claimed the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4952016/taxman-50m-blunder-rangers/">final EBT bill could be as low as £20m</a>.</p>
      <p>If this figure was known back in 2011, the Ibrox club <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4952016/taxman-50m-blunder-rangers/">may not have been plunged into financial turmoil</a> leading to liquidation.</p>
      <p>But Thomas Wallace, Head of Tax at London-based firm <a href="https://wttconsulting.co.uk/">WTT</a>, claimed in a Q&amp;A that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4955264/rangers-hmrc-tax-case-ebt-expert/">HMRC did NOT make any serious mistakes</a> in the case.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the agent of Light Blues' star striker Alfredo Morelos has fired a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4956945/rangers-alfredo-morelos-agent-transfer/">warning to potential clubs interested in the hitman to act soon.</a></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> ace has been on red hot form for Steven Gerrard's side this season so far and finished the league's top goalscorer last campaign too.</p>
      <p>He has scored 22 goals already this term in all competitions, including 11 in the Europa League.</p>
      <p><i>SunSport</i> revealed that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4863619/rangers-morelos-crystal-palace-20m/">Crystal Palace are among keen parties to swoop for the Colombian</a>.</p>
      <p>And now one of the 23-year-old's representatives has told potential suitors to come in for him sooner rather than later - because the longer they wait, the more money it'll take to snap him up.</p>
