      <p>“My heart is so heavy right now,” Gomez wrote. “It makes me sick and extremely angry. (I don’t mind if there may be retaliation) this is my opinion. It’s greed, manipulation and power. There is no heart or thought of anyone else’s. No respect for the words my friend has written since she was a 14-year-old in her bedroom. You’ve robbed and crushed one of our best songwriters of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with fans and the world.”</p>

      <p>She added, “People can say b***h, but what I’m saying to you is that’s called a woman with true identity and strength who takes no s**t.”</p>
      <p>Gomez also told fans, “The MOST important thing to Taylor is her family, love, her fans and her MUSIC.</p>
      <p>“I really hope there is a change of heart over this unfortunate situation,” she continued. “Seeing my best friend (or any of my friends) be constantly pulled down is the worst feeling. Taylor fights. She will never stop fighting. People grow from choices. Some will stay exactly the same. I just want a change of heart. I love you.”</p>

      <p>On Thursday evening, Swift revealed on Twitter that her performance at the upcoming AMAs and a new Netflix documentary were both up in the air due to Big Machine owners Braun and Borchetta blocking her from using her music recorded under their label.</p>
      <p>“Scott Borchetta told my team that they’ll allow me to use my music only if I do these things: If I agree to not re-record copycat versions of my songs next year (which is something I’m both legally allowed to do and looking forward to) and also told my team that I need to stop talking about him and Scooter Braun,” Swift said.</p>
      <p>She added, “This is WRONG. Neither of these men had a hand in the writing of those songs. They did nothing to create the relationship I have with my fans. So, this is where I’m asking for your help.”</p>
