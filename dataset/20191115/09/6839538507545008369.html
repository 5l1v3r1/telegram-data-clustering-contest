      <p>Residents north of Toowoomba face an anxious night as fire crews battle to save their homes. With more than 60 fires still raging across Queensland, the weather bureau says there is no end in sight to the dangerous conditions.</p>
      <p>There are more than 60 blazes still burning across Queensland amid high temperatures and hot, dry westerly winds that will continue this weekend.</p>
      <p>People were told to evacuate from the path of the blaze at Pechey forest today as it raced towards Ravensbourne on the Darling Downs.</p>
      <p>The Pechey fire has been burning for several days and flared as conditions worsened.</p>
      <p>It was likely to affect Purtill Rd, Garvey Rd, Ravensbourne Tip Rd, Mount Jockey Rd and McQuillan Rd this evening.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, firefighters are working to protect Spicers Peak Lodge in the southern Darling Downs town of Maryvale from a bushfire that has been threatening the property since Monday.</p>
      <p>The fire has not yet reached the luxury resort however a large blaze continues to burn in its vicinity.</p>
      <p>A Queensland Fire and Emergency Services spokeswoman said firefighting crews are currently stationed around the lodge to protect it.</p>
      <p>Nineteen crews are on the scene and another seven are on route to the Clumber bushfire, which has been burning since last week.</p>
      <p>Guests and employees were evacuated on Monday.</p>
      <p>The weather bureau says there is no end in sight for Queensland’s bushfire crisis, with dangerous conditions to continue into next week.</p>
      <p>The Darling Downs will bear the brunt of dry, hot winds with extreme fire danger forecast for Sunday making conditionschallenging for firefighters.</p>
      <p>“Leave now” warnings remain in place today for residents of Woodgate and nearby Kinkuna Waters,south of Bundaberg.</p>
      <p>A worrying fire at Thornside, west of Gympie, and an unpredictable fire at Tarome are at “watch and act”.</p>
      <p>The Cobraball fire near Yeppoon in central Queensland continues to concern authorities given the difficult weather conditions expected in coming days.</p>
      <p>The blaze, which destroyed 15 of the 16 homes lost in Queensland over the past week, is 90 per cent contained but that could change when high winds arrive.</p>
      <p>Damage assessments are continuing, with Queensland Fire and Emergency Services saying the number of homes lost could rise.</p>
      <p>But QFES assistant commissioner Tony Johnstone said crews had done a remarkable job protecting property.</p>
      <p>“It’s really hard to say how many houses we’ve saved but I’d say in excess of 300 or 400,” he told ABC Radio.</p>
      <p>Temperatures near major fire grounds are expected to soar beyond 30C today and into the weekend.</p>
      <p>Former QFES commissioner Lee Johnson is one of 23 fire and emergency services leaders demanding urgent federal action to phase out fossil fuels that are driving climate change and elevating Australia’s bushfire risks.</p>
      <p>He says cyclones and floods — not fires — have always been Queensland’s primary threats, but that is changing.</p>
      <p>“In my 40 years’ experience I don’t recall ever losing this amount of property at the start of a fire season, and it’s not over yet,” he told ABC Radio.</p>
      <p>“Something has changed, and it’s not good.”</p>
      <p>Noosa Mayor Tony Wellington says his constituents are angry and frustrated that a lack of action on climate change has leftthem facing unprecedented fire threats.</p>
      <p>He says councils need extra funding for dedicated disaster management staff. “At the moment our local disaster controlleris simply one of our key staff - one of our executive directors,” he told the ABC.</p>
      <p>“For the last two weeks in particular, but also over the last two months, they haven’t been able to carry on with their regularduties because they’re dealing with fire issues.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Cunningham Highway is closed indefinitely due to bushfire hazards plaguing The Gap.</p>
      <p>Warwick Senior Sergeant Shane Reid the situation hadn’t improved overnight.</p>
      <p>“My understanding is that fires are still approaching the service station on top of The Gap and the ridge near Mitchell’s Gully,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If fire continues to burn up towards the edge of the highway, and up and down The Gap, it will stay closed.</p>
      <p>“There’s no indication at this stage when it might open again.”</p>

      <p>At the Woodgate blaze, a number of areas remained closed, with residents unable to return home. Some have been allowed back into the bushfire zone under police escort.</p>
      <p>There are concerns power, water and mobile phone service may be lost.</p>
      <p>Near the Black Snake fire, Thornside residents are urged to leave now if they have not already. Those who have got out are told not to return.</p>
      <p>“There’s even potential pockets on Sunday, which is expected to be our next peak day, to have extreme conditions in some localised areas in the southwest of Queensland,” Queensland Fire and Emergency Service Acting Commissioner Mike Wassing said. “We haven’t seen any rain. We won’t see any rain.”</p>
      <p>It comes as a teenage boy is charged with lighting a fire that destroyed 36 structures.</p>
      <p>Cooler temperatures and slower winds allowed firefighters to make up ground on several bushfires yesterday, but conditions are expected to worsen again this weekend.</p>
      <p>Fires near Bundaberg, as well as southwest of Brisbane, northeast of Toowoomba and west of Yeppoon forced residents to remain out of their homes or prepare for evacuations for the third day in a row.</p>
      <p>More than 70 fires burned yesterday, including a series of spot fires near Noosa North Shore, which authorities believe were deliberately lit.</p>

      <p>A boy, 16, was charged with starting the fires near Yeppoon.</p>
      <p>About 246 homes have been saved in recent weeks, according to Premier Annatastica Palaszczuk, who urged parents to talk with their children about the dangers of lighting fires.</p>
      <p>“I think everybody needs to sit down and talk to their children about the consequences,” she said. “I mean, thankfully there were no lives lost, but it could’ve been a whole different story.”</p>
      <p>More than $170,000 in insurance payments have been made to Queensland victims.</p>
      <p>A fire at Woodgate, near Bundaberg, continued to rage out of control last night, with residents urged to flee their homes via the only road in and out of the region.</p>
      <p>They waited patiently on a road for police to allow them back into their homes yesterday, but a large exclusion zone remained in place.</p>

      <p>Further south at Pechey, northeast of Toowoomba – where a waterbombing helicopter crashed on Wednesday – conditions eased yesterday before a leave immediately warning was issued on Friday.</p>
      <p>Helicopter pilot Dave Williamson walked away without serious injury and his boss yesterday told media the pilot of 50 years was “lucky” to have walked away and was keen to get back to fighting fires.</p>
      <p>A similar reprieve came at Clumber in the Scenic Rim, southwest of Brisbane.</p>
      <p>“Things are in good shape,” State Disaster Co-ordinator and Queensland Police Service Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said.</p>
      <p>“We’re pretty happy in terms of our resources.”</p>
      <p>Minimal rain and hot temperatures predicted for the next three days are expected to give little reprieve to firefighters battling blazes.</p>

      <p>BoM national operations leader Richard Wardle said severe fire conditions were expected in the Darling Downs and Granite Belt regions throughout the weekend.</p>
      <p>The weather bureau is monitoring 70 fires alongside QFES and is focusing heavily on the Noosa North Shore, Woodgate, and Kilkivin fires. Isolated thunder storms are also forecast for the southeast but are expected to bring “minimal” rain.</p>
      <p>“The main story with these storms could be the dry lightning potentially igniting further fires,” Mr Wardle said.</p>
      <p>The warmer conditions returning over the weekend will also see a “low-intensity” heatwave set in across the south east, Granite Belt and Darling Downs.</p>
      <p>An onshore flow will also provide a slight relief for coastal areas.</p>
      <p>The bureau is expecting next week that the heatwave will push north up as far as the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>
      <p>Mr Wardle said the temperatures likely to set in over the weekend would bring high and severe fire dangers.</p>
      <p>“The temperatures in some locations will be 6C above average for this time of year,” he said. “Winds won’t be that much of a story unless they are associated with gusty thunder storms.”</p>
      <p>Smoke haze is likely to remain low over the weekend across the region, but a southerly wind change early next week could bring conditions back to what was experienced earlier this week.</p>
      <p>For the longer-range forecast, Mr Wardle said Queensland would remain “dryer than average”, with no significant rain on the horizon.</p>
