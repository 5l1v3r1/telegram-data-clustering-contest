      <p>Get into the swing golf in the great indoors thanks to a new centre, just a short drive from Tiverton.</p>
      <p>PGA Professional Richard Coffin is launching his new business, Silverleigh Indoor Golf Centre, with a free open day on Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <p>Richard will welcome new and old players to the centre at Chitterley Business Centre off the A396 near Silverton to see the new facility and to have a round of golf using his indoor, virtual reality setup.</p>
      <p>He said: “I opened here six weeks ago as it had always been an idea in the back of my mind.</p>
      <p>“I knew simulators existed and I’ve been on them before. It’s a great coaching tool for me to coach existing clients and an excellent place for new players as well. You haven’t got the weather to worry about for a start, and it’s always warm and cosy.</p>

      <p>The new indoor facility offers lessons, practice and play, using the latest technology to simulate the flight of your golf ball. Using real clubs and real balls, the technology analyses each shot as the ball flies from the club and accurately portrays the ball’s flight on a screen. Each shot provides comprehensive feedback on the trajectory, spin rates, distance and direction, thus helping the golfer to understand their swing and ball flight better.</p>
      <p>The indoor practice room provides the opportunity to learn and practice all aspects of the game, including; long game, pitching, chipping and putting.</p>
      <p>“There’s also a shop which I’m developing,” Richard added. “It’ll be a traditional pro shop with clubs and advice for beginners and juniors especially. I’ve got a workshop which I love tinkering and repairing, customising, and building new clubs.”</p>

      <p>Richard has been helping golfers improve their game and guiding new players for almost 20 years.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been involved in golf all my life; from when I was trotting behind my dad to becoming a qualified as a PGA pro. I’ve been coaching professionally for 15 years or so on driving ranges and courses in the local area. Owning my own business has always been my dream.</p>
      <p>“All my existing clients have loved it so far despite some being a little reticent to start with as they did not know what to make of playing indoors. They’ve loved it and now keep coming back for more.</p>
      <p>“Players can now play Gleneagles where the Ryder Cup was held, there’s the Belfry, and we’ve got lots of famous courses across the US. It’s limitless how many courses are available where you can play real golf indoors.</p>

      <p>“It’s a very friendly, unassuming environment. It’s not the usual old fashioned airs and graces there used to be, the stigma attached to golf is diminishing. I think a lot of people still think it’s a bit posh and only for the well off, but it’s not like that anymore. You don’t need anything to start with.</p>
      <p>“Come along; we provide everything you need to have a go. Call ahead, and I’ll book you into a slot, and come and see what it’s all about and give you a few tips on the day.”  </p>
