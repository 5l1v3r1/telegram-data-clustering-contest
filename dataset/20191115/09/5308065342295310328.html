      <p>Hong Kong TVB actress Jacqueline Wong is making a comeback to social media after seven months of hiatus.</p>
      <p>On Nov 10, Sunday, Wong changed her profile photo and uploaded her first Instagram post since her apology in April following her involvement in a cheating scandal with singer Andy Hui.</p>
      <p>The post features a stack of scripts for TVB serial Finding Her Voice and she captioned the photo with: “I have gone through many emotions after Finding Her Voice went from being shelved, rumours of it being reshot, then status quo, and finally it became the anniversary drama.”</p>

      <p>The 30-year-old actress plays the leading role in Finding Her Voice which is one of the Hong Kong broadcaster’s major productions to mark its 52nd anniversary this year.</p>
      <p>After the scandal, it was to be ‘reshot’ to remove scenes that include Wong but was later aired on prime time from Oct 7 with the 30th and final episode to be screened on Nov 15.</p>
      <p>“Beside being happy that Finding Her Voice has been shown in its original version, my biggest feeling along the way is ‘fear’. I fear that its rating will be affected by me and fear that I will waste everyone’s effort,” she said.</p>
      <p>With strong performances from veteran actors such as Hugo Ng, Chung King Fai and Ram Chiang, the show enjoyed good ratings and received rave reviews.</p>
      <p>There were fears that the serial’s viewership ratings would be affected by the scandal but it proved otherwise.</p>
      <p>Wong thanked her viewers for watching the show and her co-stars and colleagues for their support and understanding.</p>
      <p>With more than 14,000 likes and supportive words from her friends, the post is speculated to gauge the viewers’ reactions on Wong’s eventual return to the public eye.</p>
      <p>The actress is reportedly living in the United States since April.</p>
