      <p>Yankees general manager Brian Cashman — who spent Thursday night at Yankee Stadium, taking part in the Sleep Out to raise money for Covenant House in Manhattan — said third base was Gio Urshela’s “position to lose.”</p>
      <p>“Just like last year though, with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/miguel-andujar-is-a-popular-trade-target-by-rival-gms/">[Miguel] Andujar</a>, it was his position to lose An injury took it away,” Cashman said. “You can’t deny how great Gio played last year. I wouldn’t be honest if I didn’t tell you going into spring training he would have the leg up.”</p>

      <p>Austin Romine is a free agent and Cashman has been in touch with his agent, but he also said he’d “be comfortable” with Kyle Higashioka as Gary Sanchez’s backup. Higashioka is out of minor league options and would be a cheaper alternative to Romine.</p>
      <p>“We feel he’s ready to go,’’ Cashman said of Higashioka, without ruling out a Romine return.</p>
