      <p>Tammy Abraham is dreaming of winning Euro 2020 after claiming his first goal for England.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea striker scored last in the Three Lions’ 7-0 romp over Montenegro which booked their place at next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>His maiden goal for his country completes a memorable 2019 for the 22-year-old after winning promotion to the Premier League with Aston Villa and scoring 11 goals in 18 games for Chelsea this season.</p>

      <p>Asked what next year might hold in store for him, he replied: “Bigger dreams hopefully.</p>
      <p>“Being at the Euros, winning it, top four or top two in the Premier League. Just believing! The sky’s the limit.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, hopefully, I don’t want to jinx myself.”</p>

      <p>When pushed on whether England can end 54 years of hurt next summer, he said: “I believe so.”</p>
      <p>Abraham’s game has gone to the next level this season, but he thinks he can get even better working alongside Harry Kane when on international duty.</p>
      <p>Kane took his tally to 31 goals for England with a clinical hat-trick against Montenegro, taking him above Alan Shearer, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney on the all-time list.</p>
      <p>Abraham is right at the bottom of those standings, but is keen to learn from the Tottenham striker in order to make a quick rise.</p>

      <p>“It’s always been a dream for me to be on the same pitch as him,” he added. “Every day, I watch him, learn off him.</p>
      <p>“To be on the same pitch with him, training with him every day, watching learning off him, it’s always nice to have that type of player to learn from.</p>
      <p>“It’s for me to add to my game. You saw, his great finishing, even in training practising, you can see his professionalism.</p>
      <p>“He wants to be the best, to have someone like that to look up to is a dream.”</p>

      <p>And he wants to make sure he is not a flash in the pan.</p>
      <p>“It’s just about maintaining it, not just for the rest of the season but for many years, hopefully,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always believed in myself to score goals, there’s still a lot in my game I need to develop but I can’t complain. It’s going well.</p>

      <p>“There’s going to be a lot of praise, you just have to stay focused, ignore some bits and use some bits to lift my confidence.</p>
      <p>“I’m just going into every game, believe in myself, block everything out and focus.</p>
      <p>“That’s what you need as a player to get to the top level. To always believe, even in tough times.”</p>
