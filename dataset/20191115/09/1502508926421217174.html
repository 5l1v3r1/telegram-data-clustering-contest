      <p>Congress leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rahul-gandhi">Rahul Gandhi </a>attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday over an official survey which reportedly points to a fall in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/consumer-spending">consumer spending </a>and said "Modinomics stinks so bad", the government has to hide its own reports.</p>
