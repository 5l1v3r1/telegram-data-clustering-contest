      <p>Shenmue 3 was one of the many new games announced at <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/game/e3-2015-replay-rewatch-microsoft-sony-nintendo-ea-ubisoft-xbox-bethesda-square-enix-live-streams-replay-3523033/">E3 2015</a>, though one of the few to be announced on stage with a Kickstarter campaign. That Kickstarter turned out to be one of the most successful ever, raising more than $6.3 million, proving the huge fan demand.</p>
      <p>Shenmue 2, originally on the Deamcast, was released way back in 2001, but developer Ys Net secured the official rights to the Shenmue 3 license from Sega. The open-world action RPG will be built with the Unreal 4 engine and follows the story of Ryo Hazuki as he tries to find his father's killer.</p>
      <p>Shenmue 3 will have familiar elements from its predecessors along with new fight mechanics as the developer aims to achieve a new level of interactive storytelling. “Our ambition is to deliver a Shenmue experience that will draw in newcomers to the series and reward diehard fans with its deep story and rich gameplay.”</p>
      <p>Here's what we know so far about the Shenmue 3 release date, price, platforms, and more. Also read our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/games/shenmue-3-3777173/">Shenmue 3 preview</a>.</p>
      <h3>When is the Shenmue 3 release date?</h3>
      <p>With the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3617863-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fgame%2Fshenmue-3-3617863%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2Fysnet%2Fshenmue-3">Kickstarter</a> surpassing its $2m target extremely quickly (in just 9 hours), the game officially entered development in July 2015, with a planned release date of December 2017. It was then pushed back to 2018, and again to August 2019 before <i>finally</i> settling on <b>19 November 2019</b> for release<b>. </b></p>
      <p>“We unfortunately must delay its release,” designer Yu Suzuki said. “By utilising new technologies we have been able to discover new possibilities and expressions. In many ways the game has become bigger and more beautiful than I initially expected. We do, however, need more time to deliver the game to you.”</p>
      <h3>What platforms will it be on?</h3>
      <p>Shenmue 3 is in development for <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/pcs/">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/game/sony-ps4-1tb-release-date-price-specs-3616550/">PS4</a>, and publisher Deep Silver has confirmed that there are no plans to release the game on Xbox One - although speculation suggests that it'll appear at <i>some point</i>, just probably not at launch. </p>
      <p>While Kickstarter backers were originally promised that Shenmue 3 would arrive via Steam on PC, the company has since announced that Shenmue 3 is an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC, and all backers will now receive codes for Epic's platform instead. Backers aren't happy, but there's not a lot that can be done about it at this stage. </p>
