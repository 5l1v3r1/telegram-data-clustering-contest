      <h2>‘I’d beat a b**** down too’ lyrics appeared online earlier this week</h2>

      <p>A representative for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Eminem">Eminem</a> has responded after a controversial verse, in which he takes sides with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ChrisBrown">Chris Brown</a> over his assault of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Rihanna">Rihanna</a>, leaked earlier this week. </p>
      <p>“Of course I side with Chris Brown, I’d beat a b**** down too,” he raps in an extended version of “Things Get Worse”, which was apparently recorded during the sessions for his 2009 album <i>Marshall Mathers.</i></p>
      <p>The rapper’s publicist Dennis Dennehy has now released a statement, saying: “This is a leak of something that’s over 10 years old. After Eminem recorded it, he scrapped it, and rewrote it. Obviously he and Rihanna have a great relationship.” </p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the track, Eminem raps about beating a sex worker “mercilessly” and leaving her “for dead” as well as murdering then-16-year-old actor Dakota Fanning. </p>
      <p>Brown assaulted his then-girlfriend Rihanna when they were on their way to the Grammys in 2009. </p>
      <p>He was found guilty of felony assault and sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling and six months of community service. </p>
      <p>Eminem and Rihanna have collaborated numerous times, including on the songs "Love the Way You Lie” and “The Monster”, the latter of which is about being in a violent relationship. </p>
