      <p>Users can also control the type of data they wish to share with each study.</p>
      <p>The move comes at a time when big technology companies are pushing deeper into collecting health-related data of their users.</p>
      <p>Alphabet’s Google tapped the fitness trackers market earlier this month with a $2.1 billion bid for Fitbit and said it sees an opportunity to introduce its own wearable devices and invest more in digital health.</p>
