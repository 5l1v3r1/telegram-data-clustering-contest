      <p>Cameroon’s opposition party, the Social Democratic Front has agreed to participate in the February 2020 legislative and municipal elections only if the government put in place favourable security measures.</p>
      <p>The elections had been postponed twice due to growing threats from armed separatists in the country’s two English-speaking regions.</p>
      <p>A secessionist struggle has been raging in the two regions since October 2016. Separatists have vowed to disrupt the elections in the Anglophone regions.</p>
      <p>But Cameroon’s Minister of Territorial Administration Paul Atanga Nji had earlier told reporters that “necessary security measures” would be taken to ensure peaceful elections.</p>
      <p>The 2018 presidential election stoked a political crisis in this Central African nation, where President Paul Biya has ruled for 37 years.</p>
      <p>Opposition leader Maurice Kamto was imprisoned along with some of his supporters for denouncing electoral fraud through marches.</p>
