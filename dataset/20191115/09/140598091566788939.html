      <p>A game of intelligence and forward thinking, chess has survived through the ages evolving from a variety of ancient similar games.</p>
      <p>Even a chess novice can appreciate the skill and art that lies in being successful at chess. Although, not necessarily the easiest thing to persuade impatient children to play, once learnt chess is a skill that will last a lifetime.</p>

      <p>Monopoly is renowned as Britain's favourite Christmas game. Whilst we might think of the familiar British edition with its famous London landmarks as the 'proper' version, the game was originally set in America.</p>
      <p>In World War II, the British Secret Service even set up fake charities to get the game into prisoner of war camps, using the board to conceal real money, maps and compasses.</p>

      <p>A relative newcomer when it comes to heavyweights of Christmas entertainment, Bananagrams is a fast paced, addictive game with a great amount of flexibility. Likened to a version of Scrabble called take-two, the aim of Bananagrams is to be the first to complete a vertical and horizontal chain of words</p>

      <p>Released in 1982, Trivial Pursuit is a classic Christmas game, with wide ranging questions on general knowledge and popular culture.</p>
      <p>The game has been known to spark a number of arguments, with families apparently even disagreeing on whether the wedges you win represent slices of cake or cheese.</p>
