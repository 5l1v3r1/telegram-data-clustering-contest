      <p> According to market analysis agency, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/strategy-analytics">Strategy Analytics</a>, in Q2 2019, the global smartphone Applications Processor (AP) market declined 2% year-over-year falling to $4.8 billion. It made this known in its latest report.</p>
      <p>Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung LSI, HiSilicon and MediaTek are among the top five global mobile phone application processor (AP) market share. Among them, Qualcomm ranks first with a 40% revenue share. In addition, the likes of Apple and Samsung LSI’s revenue shares were 20% and 13%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Strategy Analytics expects smartphone applications with AI engines to grow 45% year-on-year in the second half of 2019. In Q2 2019, smartphone application processors (APs) with AI engines account for nearly 50% of total smartphone application processor shipments. This is a 20% increase year-on-year.</p>
      <h3>Official Statements from Strategy Analytics Executives</h3>
      <p>Sravan Kundojjala, Associate Director at Strategy Analytics, said…“After seeing two consecutive years of smartphone AP shipment decline, MediaTek and Unisoc once again saw their shipments slide year-on-year in Q2 2019. Both companies, however, showed signs of recovery on a sequential basis with renewed product line-ups and design-wins. MediaTek’s new Helio P90, P70, and P22 APs have been received well by the market. They also featured in multiple high volume smartphones from Chinese OEMs. In addition, Unisoc’s new Tiger-branded AP line-up looks competitive versus Snapdragon 600 and Helio P series of chips and has the potential to bring Unisoc back into the game.”</p>
      <p>Stuart Robinson, Executive Director of the Strategy Analytics Handset Component Technologies service, added, “The vertically-integrated companies Apple, HiSilicon and Samsung LSI increased their cumulative smartphone AP market share to 37 percent in Q2 2019. HiSilicon, in particular, posted 28 percent AP shipment growth in Q2 2019. Despite the vertical competition challenge, Qualcomm maintained its smartphone AP market share leadership and saw strong traction for its flagship Snapdragon 855 AP. Qualcomm’s strengthened Snapdragon 600-series and newly introduced Snapdragon 700-series of APs all performed well in Q2 2019. Qualcomm continues to leverage its strong relationships with Chinese smartphone manufacturers to generate significant volume for its Snapdragon APs.”</p>
