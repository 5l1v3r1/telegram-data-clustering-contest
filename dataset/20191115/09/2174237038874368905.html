      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/ozzy-osbourne-solo-albums-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Ozzy Osbourne</a>’s daughter Kelly says the family are constantly being asked if they’d be willing to return to TV for another series of <i>The Osbournes</i>.</p>
      <p>The MTV reality show was broadcast between 2002 and 2005 and made the whole family household names, and Kelly says there is currently an offer on the table which is tempting – although nothing has been decided yet.</p>
      <p>She tells <a href="https://people.com/tv/the-osbournes-return-kelly-osbourne-says-family-close-accepting-an-offer/">People</a>: “I’m not joking, every single year about every three months or so, someone else gives us another offer and we keep saying, ‘no.’ It keeps coming around. </p>
      <p>“Right now there’s another offer on the table and I think this is the closest we’ve ever come to accepting one, but whether that will happen or not, I don’t know.”</p>
      <p>Asked why the family have constantly declined to reboot the series over the years, Kelly replies: “We’ve got other people to think about. My brother’s got three kids.</p>
      <p>“Do we want that life for them without them being old enough to choose if they want to do it or not like my brother and I were?”</p>
      <p>Last month, Ozzy’s wife and manager Sharon told <a href="https://www.siriusxm.com/servlet/Satellite?c=SXM_PageDetail_C&amp;childpagename=SXM/SXM_PageDetail_C/ResponsivePage&amp;pagename=SXM/WrapperR&amp;cid=1293967628541&amp;navtype=none&amp;programCode=MECLABST10&amp;OLPT=OLPTPCOFFER2A&amp;affsrc=1&amp;clickid=VrITXRW-sxyJWJXwUx0Mo3EzUknwzzzphU7HWc0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_campaign=SXM_NA_BAU&amp;utm_content=Future%20PLC.&amp;utm_medium=Affiliate&amp;utm_source=NA_Sel-06-mo-for-030-and-Sel-06-mo-for-030-Streaming_NA&amp;utm_term=VrITXRW-sxyJWJXwUx0Mo3EzUknwzzzphU7HWc0">SiriusXM</a> she was glad <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/sharon-osbournes-glad-the-osbournes-stopped-before-the-rise-of-social-media"><i>The Osbournes</i> came to an end before the rise of social media</a>.</p>
      <p>She added: “The press were bad enough, but I can imagine peer groups of theirs online and what they would have said and done.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-announces-rescheduled-no-more-tours-2-uk-and-european-dates">Ozzy announced his rescheduled <i>No More Tours 2</i> dates across the UK and Europe</a> which will take place towards the end of 2020 with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-50-greatest-judas-priest-songs-ever">Judas Priest</a> – and it's now been revealed that <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-most-underrated-marilyn-manson-songs">Marilyn Manson</a> will join The Prince Of Darkness on his run of North American shows which will get underway in May.</p>
      <p>Ozzy says: "Marilyn is killer live. He's so fucking out there and if I think that, then look out – we're all fucked."</p>
      <p>Manson adds: "I've toured with Ozzy many times and it's always been fucking spectacular. I'm honoured to do it again. This is one not to miss."</p>
      <p>Ozzy will play in support of his new studio album <i>Ordinary Man</i>, which is expected to be released in January. Ozzy marked the album news by launching the single <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-announces-new-album-ordinary-man-listen-to-first-single-under-the-graveyard"><i>Under The Graveyard</i></a>.</p>
