      <p>It's not even December and shops, stores and radio stations are turning up the volume on those classic Christmas tunes.</p>
      <p>Those festive favourites are everywhere and there's still more than a month to go until the big day on December 25.</p>
      <p>But it's never too early for many folk who absolutely love the chart-topping Christmas crackers.</p>

      <p>Heart Radio has already launched its 'Extra Xmas' station playing nothing but Christmas songs 24/7, wasting no time with news and presenters, but simply back-to-back Christmas Anthems to provide the 'perfect soundtrack to your personal winter wonderland'.</p>
      <p>After taking to the airwaves a full 54 days before Santa visits, there's going to a fair bit of repetition in the build up to the most wonderful time of the year.</p>

      <p>As we begin to hear the same soundtracks everywhere we go, Brits have had their say on their most hated Christmas songs they'll be hoping to avoid.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, Mariah Carey's Christmas classic 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' topped the poll to take the unfortunate crown of being the most annoying.</p>
