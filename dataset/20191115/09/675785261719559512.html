      <h1>Steven Gerrard speaks out about replacing Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Steven Gerrard is the frontrunner to replace Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool when his contract expires</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:41:28+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:41</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard is refusing to lose sight of his targets at Rangers amid speculation of a return to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Gerrard continues to be tipped to move back to Anfield once Jurgen Klopp departs the club.</p>
      <p>Klopp's current deal expires in 2022 and he has so far failed to discuss his intentions after that.</p>
      <p>Kop legend Gerrard appears the most logical replacement and is continuing to impress north of the border with Rangers.</p>
      <p>But on talk of returning to Merseyside, the former Liverpool captain said: “I am very driven and ambitious and I haven't gone into this management lightly.</p>

      <p>“We feel like we have got a really good team and we are enjoying it.</p>
      <p>“I get this question a lot about where I want to end up and what is the ambition and the dream - the dream for me is to just win the next football match.</p>
      <p>“That is all I need to focus on. I don't need to put time-frames on this or that.</p>
      <p>“I am really enjoying what I am doing and I am privileged to be in the position and the focus is the next three points or the next challenge. That is all I worry about.</p>
      <p>“It will take me wherever it takes me, if that is to the top, fantastic, but I already feel like I am working for a top club now.”</p>

      <p>Gerrard has Rangers level with Celtic at the top of the Scottish Premiership after 12 matches.</p>
      <p>The Gers have managed 10 wins so far this season and are on course to mount a title challenge.</p>
      <p>Rangers are also sat second in their Europa League group with two matches remaining.</p>
