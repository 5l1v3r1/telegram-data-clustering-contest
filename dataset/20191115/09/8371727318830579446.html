      <h1>For the First Time in Africa, Facebook Developer Conference is Coming to Nairobi</h1>

      <p>Facebook started a developer and entrepreneurship conference called F8 may years ago. The summit, which is held yearly stages discussions for the two groups that build products and services around the social media giant’s platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp).</p>
      <p>In early 2019, Facebook revealed plans to create opportunities for innovation and education through its work with in-house products and services. The corporation further discussed the value of building communities and their roles in building sustainable ecosystems.</p>
      <p>According to Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, Director Platforms Partnerships, Facebook, ‘iD8 is an opportunity for us to connect face-to-face with developers and share the latest technology and product updates as well as offer attendees an opportunity to share where they are in their journey.’</p>
      <p>The meet explores topics that range from AR/VR (the company has been fronting products centered around VR, although its future stand Oculus is not clear), Messenger (a complementary app to Facebook), social commerce, and much more.</p>
      <p>The program, which has since made an appearance in New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, and Singapore is coming to Nairobi on November 22. This will be the first time iD8 will make a stop in Africa.</p>
      <p>“Facebook iD8 is making its way to Nairobi! Tune into the livestreams on November 22nd to hear speakers share everything from the importance of globally accessible developer education to how you can build your business on Facebook,” reads iD8’s statement on Facebook.</p>
      <blockquote>‘There are networking opportunities, deep-dive sessions and product demos that showcase the latest in AI, open source, AR/VR, developer programs as well as new tools across Facebook’s family of apps that help build products and grow businesses.’</blockquote>
      <p>The conference will primarily feature two-way dialogues, and attendees will get the chance to share their experiences with the Facebook products and challenges – of which the corporation will get to learn about local problems and roadblocks. Attendees will have an opportunity to interact with other members of Facebook’s shared community that may face matching issues.</p>
      <p>“We’ll have hands-on demonstrations and discussions with Facebook product experts who can provide guidance and help unblock challenges in your development process,” adds Konstantinos Papamiltiadis.</p>
      <p>It should be noted iD8 is an invite-only event. The links to the invite page have not been released, yet. When that happens, applications will be reviewed before a confirmation/rejection message is sent.</p>
