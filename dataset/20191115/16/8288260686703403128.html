      <h1>The TV debates will dominate the general election</h1>
      <h2>Televised debates tell us about the personalities of the party leaders but not so much about their policies</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:53:59+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker, https://www.facebook.com/JonWalkerPolitics?pnref=story</a></address>
      <p>We’ve had roughly one and a half weeks of the election campaign so far, with around three and half weeks still to go.</p>
      <p>But everything will change next week - when the first televised debate of the general election takes place.</p>
      <p>The focus will be on how the candidates are preparing for the debate, who comes up with the best lines and who is considered to have “won” when it’s over.</p>
      <p>Spin doctors will be working overtime to try to convince us that their candidate came across best. So will the more vocal activists on Twitter and other social media.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And this is only the first debate of the election. There are at least two more to go after that.</p>
      <p>Do televised debates really help us decide who would make the best Prime Minister? They might tell you something about a party leader’s personality but they don’t really tell you whether they will be much good at the job they’re applying for. You can have the right idea about how to run the health service, and the skills needed to turn your ideas into reality, even if you struggle to come up with a witty reply when a political opponent calls you names in front of TV cameras.</p>
      <p>However, the debates are probably here to stay. And they might make for good television.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Can Boris Johnson prove that he understands the details of the policies he’s proposing? Johnson is smarter than he sometimes lets on, but he also has an arrogance and lack of maturity that leads him to treat things as a joke. There’s a statesman in there somewhere, but we’ll only see it if he can resist the urge to play the clown.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, has a bad temper which causes him to snap at people who ask him awkward questions. It will be interesting to see whether he can keep that in check throughout the debate (we can only hope that he, and Mr Johnson of course, are asked plenty of awkward questions).</p>
      <p>In both cases, these involve the personalities of the party leaders rather than their policies. The reality is that a debate is unlikely to teach us much that we didn’t know already about the policies supported by the leaders, and a detailed face-to-face grilling with a seasoned interviewer would probably yield more information.</p>
      <p>However, there are some areas where the debate might provide illumination. For Mr Johnson, it would be good to know how he can claim to be the champion of the police when a Conservative government which he supported cut police funding year after year.</p>
      <p>For Mr Corbyn, it might be worth asking exactly how a Labour government would become owner of 10% of every large British business. This is one of its boldest proposals and Labour presents this as a scheme to give workers a stake in the businesses they are employed by, but you and I won’t actually own the shares.</p>
      <p>Presumably, Labour doesn’t actually plan to buy a 10% stake in every business. Big businesses are generally owned by shareholders, and if by any chance you have money in a pension fund then that means you.</p>
