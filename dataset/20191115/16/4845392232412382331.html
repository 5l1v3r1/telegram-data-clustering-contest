      <h1>Why So Many CEOs Don’t Realize They’ve Got a Bad Jobs Problem</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:58:42+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Bach, Zeynep Ton</a></address>
      <p>Last month, while moderating a CEO panel at a <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/icgf/events/new-deal-new-century">conference in Washington, D.C.</a>, one of us asked whether the Business Roundtable’s recent <a href="https://opportunity.businessroundtable.org/ourcommitment/">statement on a corporation’s purpose</a> would convince business leaders to improve job quality for hourly workers. The panel argued that CEOs already focus on frontline job quality — much more than people assume.</p>
      <p>Looking at the facts, that’s hard to believe. One-third of American workers are in jobs for which the median wage is below $15 an hour (or $31,200 a year at 40 hours a week). More than half of retail and food service workers get less than a week’s notice <a href="https://shift.berkeley.edu/its-about-time-how-work-schedule-instability-matters-for-workers-families-and-racial-inequality/">of their schedule</a>. Yet our extensive experience with top executives has shown us that many genuinely believe they <i>are</i> doing everything they can for their frontline workers and therefore <i>don’t</i> have a bad jobs problem. But they aren’t and they do. How can these data-driven business leaders be so misinformed?</p>
      <p><b>1. They’re benchmarking against other poor performers. </b>Company leaders we’ve spoken with are quick to point out that they “pay in line with the market.” (Frontline managers, however, are equally quick to say that their companies don’t pay frontline workers nearly enough.) Large companies often have a whole department dedicated to setting wage rates according to competitor benchmarks and regional cost-of-living variations. But in a sea of mediocrity — which is what the U.S. service industry is in terms of frontline job quality — keeping pace with median performers should not be the goal. Imagine, instead, if retailers benchmarked wages against Costco, which pays slightly over $23 an hour (compared to a retail median of $11.30) or if health care companies benchmarked against Kaiser Permanente, which according to Payscale, pays certified nursing assistants (CNAs) about <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Certified_Nurse_Assistant_(CNA)/Hourly_Rate/f965735d/Kaiser-Permanente">$20 an hour</a> (compared to an industry median of $13.72). They would realize they were falling short.</p>
      <p><b>2. They aren’t looking at the (right) data. </b>Executives are usually up on the macro labor numbers like total wage spend and average wage growth but not on what their labor model means for individual workers. When we tell them that 50% of their workers work fewer than 15 hours each week or that the majority of their full-timers earn less than $30,000 per year or that less than one-third of their full-time workers earn a living wage (all real examples from our work), they’re shocked. Many companies also track metrics, such as employee engagement, that can give a misleading picture of job quality. While engagement surveys may be useful in assessing year-on-year trends, they don’t give a true picture of job quality. We worked with one company that was proud to be certified as a great place to work, but it also had about 60% employee turnover, mainly thanks to low wages and unstable schedules provided only 72 hours in advance. Employees understood that the company didn’t offer good jobs.</p>
      <p><b>3. They’re out of touch. </b>It’s not just the data that executives are missing out on; it’s also the reality of their workers’ day-to-day lives. When we break down workers’ basic living expenses using <a href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/">a living wage calculator</a>, executives are often surprised that even workers making what executives think is a “good wage,” like $15 an hour, fall short each month. These executives are mortified when we share how hard it is for their workers to get by — like the dedicated, high-performing employee of a senior care company who had to put off her surgery for a work-related injury because she couldn’t afford to take the two to three weeks off (and didn’t have enough sick leave).</p>
      <p><b>4. They conflate culture, certain benefits, and employee appreciation with good jobs. </b>Because executives are out of touch with how hard things are for their employees, it’s easy for them to figure that a “strong culture,” frequent “employee appreciation,” and cool but insufficient benefits such as wellness programs add up to job quality. The CEO of a health care company told one of us, “I just don’t understand. I care so much about our employees and we do so much to show our appreciation, but they still keep leaving.” He was proud that the company celebrated major employment milestones for all workers and offered some discount programs. Great, but many of his frontline employees still had to work two jobs to make ends meet and had to juggle that second job with the unpredictable weekly hours at <i>his</i> company. Some companies think that encouraging employees to “be themselves” — to display tattoos, wear whatever they want, and so on — is a way of offering good jobs. The ability to express individuality may be important to employees, but it won’t pay the bills.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the solution to these problems is straightforward and something that executives and their staffs are already good at: rigorous analysis. They need to apply as much rigor to assessing their frontline jobs as to other aspects of the business. This will require (a) looking at new metrics, such as the percentage of full-time workers earning a living wage, (b) assigning much less significance to comparisons with low-paying competitors, and (c) learning about the workers’ day-to-day challenges — ideally by spending time with them. (As Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna, and his executive team <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/04/30/403257223/health-insurer-aetna-raises-wages-for-lowest-paid-workers-to-16-an-hour">did in 2015</a>.) Finally, it will require executives to be honest with themselves and not conflate their intentions (or culture) with their practices.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately there is a deeper problem that is more difficult to solve: the beliefs some executives have about the value of hourly jobs and workers. Consider the following comments, shared with us by senior executives (including two CEOs) of four <i>Fortune 500</i> companies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Some jobs just don’t contribute that much, so they can’t be high paying.”</li>
        <li>“We already pay more than average to people who have limited skills.”</li>
        <li>“There’s a limit on how much you can do with a job like ‘cashier.’”</li>
        <li>“Retail employees are just college kids who don’t need stability.” (As a note, the executive who shared this is wrong — the median age in retail is 37 — but her error is quite common.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These company leaders buy into <a href="https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/11/the-case-for-good-jobs">the pernicious myth</a> that certain jobs just can’t be very good. This belief allows them to look at patently poor employment practices and claim to be honestly doing all they can — even though that is not the case.</p>
      <p>So while we should encourage company leaders to evaluate job quality more carefully, it is hard to believe that we will make much progress until these mindsets about workers and the work they do shift. Having honest conversations with CEOs would be a good place to start.</p>
