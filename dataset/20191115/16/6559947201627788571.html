      <h3>What's the Difference Between Locked and Unlocked Smartphones?</h3>
      <p>In the US, many <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/119938/the-best-phones">phones</a> are sold locked to a wireless carrier—either through a software lock that prevents you from using the phone on other carriers, through a payment plan that doesn't permit you to leave that carrier, or through hardware frequency restrictions that exclude other carriers' transmission bands. Unlocked phones, paid for upfront, are different. The day you buy an unlocked phone, you can use any carrier it's compatible with, and switch carriers at will.</p>
      <p>This list gives you the best unlocked phones available in the US at a range of price points. We've tried to offer something here for budgets from $250 to $1100, running Android and iOS.</p>
      <p>We have no <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cell-phone-service-providers/82400/what-is-5g">5G</a> phones in this roundup, because right now there are no unlocked, multi-carrier 5G phones. While it's possible to run 5G phones on carriers they aren't sold by (and we've done it), it's very touch and go, and we've had permissions revoked in the middle of testing. It's better to wait until later in 2020 when the carriers and manufacturers sort out 5G compatibility.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>Why Buy Unlocked?</h3>
      <p>With an unlocked device, you can trade up or sell your phone whenever you want, without waiting for the end of a leasing or equipment installment plan—because you're not in one. You can own multiple handsets and swap your SIM card between them. You can also take advantage of <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cell-phone-service-providers/75766/chatsim-unlimited">super-cheap prepaid plans</a> from virtual operators piggybacking on compatible networks. You can pop in a local, pay-as-you-go card overseas and never pay horrendous international roaming charges. And you don't have to deal with carrier-installed bloatware.</p>
      <figure>

          <b>See How We Test Cell Phones</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, there are a few downsides to going the unlocked route. If you change SIM cards overseas, you won't have your US phone number while you're there. Some unlocked handsets only work on AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, not Sprint or Verizon. On the list above, the Nokia 7.1 and the OnePlus 7 Pro don't work on Sprint, and the Huawei P30 Pro isn't sold in the US. The other phones work on all four carrier networks.</p>
      <p>There's a new technology out there making unlocked phones even more exciting: eSIM. Electronic SIMs mean you can pick your carrier from a menu or by scanning an online QR code, rather than having to go get a physical chip. On our list, the Pixel 3a, Pixel 4, and iPhone 11 Pro all support eSIM and dual SIM, which lets you have two lines attached to one phone. That's great for having a work line and a personal line, or a foreign line and a home line.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>Where to Buy Unlocked Phones</h3>
      <p>Shopping for an unlocked handset can be a bit tricky, since carrier stores don't stock them. If you're looking for one, the Apple Store, Amazon, Best Buy Mobile, and manufacturers' online stores are good bets. In some cases, you can even unlock the phone you already own, although the particulars depend on the handset and carrier.</p>
      <p>Our most recent picks for unlocked devices in each major price category include the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ at the high end; the OnePlus 7 Pro in the midrange; and the Motorola Moto G7 Power for an inexpensive option. Unfortunately, we currently do not have an unlocked voice phone pick because the carriers are demanding unique voice phone models for their voice-over-LTE networks; for a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/93045/the-best-phones-for-seniors">simple voice phone</a>, you need to go with a carrier-specific option.</p>
      <p>Ready to break free? Pick up one of these handsets and don't feel tied to your carrier any longer. If you're deciding on a carrier, see which one came out on top in our <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks">Fastest Mobile Networks</a> tests.</p>
