        <b>Britain's Gavin Drysdale and Kayleigh Haggo were crowned the first ever race running world 100m champions as the event made its debut at the World Para-Athletics Championships in Dubai.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Haggo, 20, crossed the line in 18.32 seconds with team-mate Ellie Simpson taking silver.</p>
      <p>In the men's event Drysdale, 18, won gold in 16.72 seconds, with fellow Brit Rafi Solaiman securing silver.</p>
      <p>Both winning times were new world records.</p>
      <p>Race running athletes have severe co-ordination impairments and run with the support of a three-wheeled frame.</p>
      <p>European champion Drysdale said: "I can't believe I just did that.</p>
      <p>"It's absolutely amazing to have race running included in the Worlds here in Dubai. It opens up the door for people like me to compete at the highest level.</p>
      <p>"I remember watching London two years ago wishing I could compete at the Worlds one day so to be here two years later is a bit surreal."</p>
      <p>"It's amazing, I can't put into words how I feel," Haggo told BBC Sport.</p>
      <p>"It's a massive honour. I hope to inspire others to take up race running."</p>
      <p>Haggo and Drysdale's coach, Janice Eaglesham, passed away in July.</p>
      <p>"I want to dedicate this gold medal to my late coach Janice, she would be so proud," Drysdale added.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the final day of the World Championships, Jordan Howe finished sixth in the T35 100m.</p>
      <p>Isaac Towers and Ben Rowlings finished sixth and seventh respectively in the T34 800m final.</p>
      <p>Great Britain finish the World Championships on 29 medals, including 13 golds.</p>
      <p>That puts them third in the medal table, behind China and Brazil.</p>
