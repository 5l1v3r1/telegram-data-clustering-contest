      <p>“That Makola ban is way too harsh,” the 34-year-old tweeted. </p>
      <p>He wasn’t the only one with a strong opinion on the matter, former Kaizer Chiefs and Cape Town City striker Matthew Rusike added his thoughts.</p>

      <p>“Mpho Makola’s ban is a bit harsh???? While he is guilty and should be punished the PSL needs to consistent. Other things go completely unpunished and swept under the rug. All teams are suffering,” the Zimbabwean wrote.</p>
      <p>While former PSL referee, Ace Ncobo has lauded the PSL’s decision to punish the former Pirates star.</p>

      <p>“Good decision. Players must learn that violence on the field doesn't pay,” the veteran referee added.</p>
