      <p>Ukrmetprom President Oleksandr Kalenkov says freight railway tariffs should be reduced by 10% in Ukraine under the current crisis conditions.</p>
      <p>"Amid the crisis in all industries in global markets, we need to consider the issue of lowering Ukrzaliznytsia's tariffs by 10%, that is to set such a precedent. This will give an additional incentive to Ukrzaliznytsia to improve its internal efficiency," he said at a roundtable discussion on the <a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10702704-ukraine-s-infrastructure-ministry-wants-to-split-ukrzaliznytsia-into-three-companies.html">Ukrzaliznytsia</a> reform on November 14.</p>
      <p>According to Kalenkov, there is a global economic crisis de facto. "Today, all Ukrainian metallurgical enterprises are operating at a loss. For the second month in a row, we have seen a 10% decline in steel production. And the most unpleasant thing is the situation is expected to worsen," he said.</p>
      <p>He expressed confidence that the government and businesses would be working together so that Ukraine could pass the crisis with minimal losses.</p>
      <p>"Now enterprises are saving every hryvnia [Ukraine's national currency] in their spending and are making huge efforts to remain in global markets. They also expect a competent and balanced state policy from the government," Kalenkov added.</p>
      <p>In his opinion, the government could reinstate a decreasing coefficient of 0.25 to Ukrzaliznytsia when the latter pays land tax, as well as compensate funds the company pays to the Road Fund when purchasing diesel fuel.</p>
