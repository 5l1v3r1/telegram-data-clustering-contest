      <h2>Durham University graduate Luke Grenfell-Shaw is just 25 and is living with sarcoma which has spread to his lungs but he says he wants to prove what cancer patients can do</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Graham</a></address>
      <p>Diagnosed with advanced sarcoma at the age of just 24, Luke Grenfell-Shaw could have given up hope.</p>
      <p>Instead, the first thing the former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/durham-university">Durham University</a> student did on learning the devastating news was go for a run.</p>
      <p>It was to become a pattern for how active, sporty Luke would approach his treatment. Despite doctors suggesting he could sit back and take things easy, he completed a half-marathon halfway through a course of chemotherapy and is now planning an even bigger challenge.</p>
      <p>A year on from diagnosis, Luke has vowed to change perceptions of what cancer patients can do.</p>
      <p>Despite his illness he's planning an ambitious charity bike ride, taking him all the way from his family home in Bristol to Beijing, China's capital. He'll be riding a tandem bicycle and inviting other young cancer patients to join him on the bike throughout the route.</p>
      <p>On the way he hopes to raise money for cancer charities and inspire others, under the banner of the fundraising and awareness campaign he founded while undergoing treatment, which he's dubbed '<a href="https://bristol2beijing.org/home-page/about/aims/">CanLive</a>'. He's already raised thousands of pounds for four cancer charities, and hopes to make a total of £23,000: £1 for each mile he'll travel.</p>
      <p>Luke said: "I really hope it will be a message of inspiration: you can take control, you can do so much more than you think you can. Yes, it can be difficult, but there are things you can do.</p>
      <p>"You're living with cancer, but you can live, in fact you can have an amazing, rich and fulfilled life.</p>

      <p>"In fact, if time is short it's exactly the time when you need to get out of the door and do something that really excites you, you will never have a better opportunity."</p>
      <p>His attitude may be positive, but the former natural sciences student, who hopes to return to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/durham-city-centre">Durham</a> as part of his cycling tour, doesn't pretend that the past year has been easy.</p>
      <p>He'd been returning from travelling when he visited the doctor with a lump in his shoulder. He "didn't expect it to be anything", but was instead diagnosed with an advanced sarcoma, which had spread from his shoulder blade to his lungs. His exact form of cancer is so rare doctors don't even have a name for it yet.</p>
      <p>"It was absolutely brutal to be told at 24 years old that I'm probably going to die," he said.</p>
      <p>"Can you imagine the hopes and dreams you have, the things that of course you were going to do - of course you were going to be at your university reunion, of course - and then suddenly that is ripped to shreds? I was in tears.</p>
      <p>"It was incredibly difficult, but it was that first day that my dad and I went for a run. My dad's advice on that day was 'you can't control the situation you find yourself in, buy you can control your response'."</p>
      <p>Following his dad's advice, although Luke is "surprised to still be here" he says he's determined to make the most of whatever time he has.</p>
      <p>He's hoping to enjoy himself as much as possible and is looking forward to an "adventure" - but he says he also hopes to encourage others to live healthier lifestyles, whether or not they're suffering from serious illnesses.</p>
      <p>He says he hopes to change a "disempowering" culture which sees cancer patients as helpless. When he asked doctors if there was anything he could do in terms of diet and exercise to give himself the best chance, he was essentially told not to worry about it.</p>
      <p>But, he said: "The way I see it, this is my chance to build up my body, to keep it as strong as possible, to give it the best possible chance of getting through treatment. It keeps up your physical strength, it keeps up your mental strength, it gives you a sense of achievement.</p>
      <p>"I think me going on this cycle on a tandem bike is a way of showing that it doesn't matter how fit you are, whoever comes to join me, however ill they are, we will be going at the same speed. It sends the message that some form of exercise is accessible to pretty much anyone, even someone with cancer."</p>
      <p>Luke is raising money for 5K Your Way, Trekstock,Teenage Cancer Trust<i><b> </b></i>and CLIC Sargent at <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/bristol2beijing2020">https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/bristol2beijing2020</a></p>
