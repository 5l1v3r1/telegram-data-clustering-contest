      <p>We know you guys love beef and from all indication a bigger one is about to hit us  like a thunderbolt.</p>
      <p>Yes, it’s the chief antagonist, Shatta Wale and new hero Nana Boroo who’ll be unfolding the plot this time round from beef script.</p>
      <p>Nana Boroo of ‘Ahaye De’ fame has sent a strong worded message in a video to Shatta Wale for behaving like an animal by smashing the car of his manager all because he has a problem with Kweku Smoke.</p>
      <p>Kweku Smoke and Shatta Wale are presently <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/shatta-wale-finally-breaks-silence-after-kweku-smoke-accused-him-of-stealing-his-song/">embroiled in a feud</a> after the former accused the SM boss of stealing his song.</p>
      <p>An angry Nana Boroo shared the video where he accused Shatta Wale of attacking his manager and Kwaku Smoke indicated by the destruction of a Mercedez Benz 2018 registered car.</p>
      <p>He said he’s the only person who will pluck off that gangster wings of Shatta Wale and if he thinks we live in an animal kingdom, he will show him the animal in him.</p>
