      <p>The court heard he had been convicted of two different charges at Lincoln Crown Court and that hearing had been adjourned until December 19.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said it seemed custody was likely to be inevitable, and the pleas were acceptable.</p>
      <p>Judge Stuart Rafferty QC sent the latest case to be sentenced by the same judge at Lincoln.</p>
      <p>Elfidh remains in custody.</p>
