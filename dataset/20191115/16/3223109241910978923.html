      <h1>Watch These Movies Before ‘Ford v Ferrari’</h1>

      <p>Don’t worry, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> isn’t another misguided superhero battle a la <i>Batman v Superman</i>. Instead, this is just a good old-fashioned historical sports drama about the American racers and engineers who tried to topple the Ferrari dynasty in the mid-60s. It stars Christian Bale and Matt Damon, who’s definitely not still salty about <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/dumb-matt-damon-still-regrets-losing-massive-avatar-payday-1810318/">losing all that <i>Avatar</i> money</a>.</p>

      <h3>The Fast and Furious Saga</h3>
      <p><i>Ford v Ferrari</i> takes us back to a more classic period of American racing. But as for modern racing movies the only game in town is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fast-Furious-8-Movie-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B07QGLB3DH/"><i>Fast and Furious</i></a>. At this point, this sprawling saga is closer to a superhero or spy epic that only occasionally pays tribute to its street racing roots.</p>

      <h3>Leatherheads</h3>
      <p>For another movie about an earlier period of an iconic sport, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leatherheads-George-Clooney/dp/B001F8WU1S/"><i>Leatherheads</i></a>. George Clooney uses all the energy he absorbed from the Coen Brothers to direct and star in this comedy about the emerging world of professional American football in the 1920s.</p>

      <h3>Logan</h3>
      <p><i>Ford v Ferrari</i> is the new movie from James Mangold, a director who’s clearly into manly stories about men but without being super gross about it. And comic fans should basically worship him for his work on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logan-Hugh-Jackman/dp/B06XDH6SZP/"><i>Logan</i></a>, the mature and meditative masterpiece of an ending to Hugh Jackman’s cinematic Wolverine.</p>

      <h3>Rush</h3>
      <p>Did you know Thor starred in a racing movie? In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rush-Chris-Hemsworth/dp/B00H967074/"><i>Rush</i></a>, Chris Hemsworth basically has the same hair when he plays Formula One driver James Hunt. And if that’s not enough Marvel for you, his rival Niki Lauda is played by Baron Zemo himself Daniel Brühl.</p>

      <h3>Talladega Nights</h3>
      <p>Considering that I care more about journalism than Nascar, <i>Anchorman</i> will always be my preferred Adam McKay/Will Ferrell comedy. But <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Talladega-Nights-Ballad-Ricky-Unrated/dp/B018R7MTPQ/"><i>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</i></a> is also extremely funny and worth revisiting. Certainly a better look at how race car driving culture intersects with rural American life than Pixar’s <i>Cars</i>.</p>

      <h3>The Machinist</h3>
      <p>In<i> Ford v Ferrari</i>, Christian Bale plays the dedicated driver behind the wheel of the cars Matt Damon builds. But in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machinist-Christian-Bale/dp/B07645CLQF/"><i>The Machinist</i></a>, Bale brings that same dedication and obsession as a maker himself. This is a fine little thriller, but it’s probably most recognizable because of the frightening amount of weight Bale lost to reflect the character’s emaciated paranoid insomnia.</p>

      <h3>The Wind Rises</h3>
      <p>While I don’t care for sports themselves, I do like sports movies that use the competition as a metaphor for some larger conflict. In <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> you have the added interesting wrinkle of the artistic creativity required to actually build the cars. The stakes may not be as heavy, but the scenario reminded me of Hayao Miyazaki’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wind-Rises-Blu-ray-DVD/dp/B00MHT49KO/"><i>The Wind Rises</i></a>. The animated film depicts the artistic ambitions of the Japanese airplane engineer Jiro Horikoshi, who saw his beautiful designs only used for war.</p>
