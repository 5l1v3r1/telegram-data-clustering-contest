      <h1>Test kits at PHCs for rapid diagnosis of monkey fever</h1>
      <h2>With new equipment, test results will be ready in two hours</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:55:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Afshan-Yasmeen-343/" target="_blank">Afshan Yasmeen</a></address>
      <p>Soon, diagnosis of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), commonly known as ‘monkey fever’, could be done quickly and easily at the primary health centre (PHC) level. The National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, has developed a point-of-care rapid test kit, which is now awaiting the Drug Controller General of India’s (DCGI) approval.</p>
      <p>The test kit, developed by the Biosafety Laboratory (BSL)-Level 4 team of NIV, will allow PHCs to test and report positivity within two hours.</p>
      <p>“We are now getting the test kits externally validated in other laboratories following which there will be field trials. Simultaneously, we have also applied for approval from the DCGI. Once that is done, the kits will be made available in the affected States,” Ashok M., officer in charge of NIV’s Bengaluru unit told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p>
      <p>As of now, Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT- PCR) and serology test using IgM capture ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) are done to diagnose the disease. This usually takes one to two days for the results.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the blood samples from the districts have to be transported to the Viral Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL), Shivamogga, which is the main arm of the Department of Health and Family Welfare tackling the disease.</p>
      <h3>Point-of-care</h3>
      <h3>“The new rapid test is a molecular test for which blood samples will be drawn and tested at the PHC itself. This will enable diagnosis to be provided at the point of care within two hours,” said Kiran S.K., Deputy Director, VDL, Shivamogga.</h3>
      <p>Principal Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) Jawaid Akhtar said the use of these kits is one of the many recommendations made by Karnataka to the National Centre for Disease Control.</p>
      <h3>Cases reported</h3>
      <p>KFD was limited to the Western Ghats of Karnataka for about seven decades. However, in the last seven years, cases have also been reported from adjacent States along the Western Ghats (Kerala, Goa, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu). The rapid test will be of great help in Karnataka, which is one of the worst affected States.</p>
      <p>“We are entering into this year’s (2019-20) KFD season and are hoping the numbers will be less. We have carried out an aggressive vaccination drive and over two lakh people have been vaccinated from August 2018. In the next one month, over 1.5 lakh more people will be vaccinated. The effectiveness of the vaccine is up to 85% among those who receive three doses,” added Dr. Kiran.</p>
