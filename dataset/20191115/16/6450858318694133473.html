      <h2>The Davis Cup Finals have been revamped this year, with a new format and Andy Murray's return to international tennis - here's how to watch live</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:20:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author">Dominic Preston</a></address>
      <p>The Davis Cup Finals are back this year in a whole new format, hot on the heels of the ATP Finals as the second epic calendar-ending men's tennis event.</p>
      <p>That's not all though, as this year also marks Andy Murray's long-awaited return to international tennis after a year that's seen him work his way back into top-level tournaments - could we see Murray vs Nadal once again?</p>
      <p>Here's what you need to know about the new Davis Cup format, when the matches are, and how to watch the tennis live, either online or on TV.</p>
      <h3>When are the Davis Cup Finals?</h3>
      <p>The tournament starts on <b>Monday 18 November</b> and runs until <b>Sunday 24 November 2019</b>.</p>
      <h3>Where is it held this year?</h3>
      <p>The 2019 tournament is taking place at the Caja Magica in Madrid, Spain.</p>
      <h3>What's the new format?</h3>
      <p>This year the Davis Cup is adopting a similar format to the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-atp-finals-3686365/">ATP Finals</a>, but with teams.</p>
      <p>The 18 participating countries have been split into six groups of three. The teams within each group will play each other in best-of-three series consisting of two singles matches and one doubles, playing all three matches on the same day.</p>
      <p>That round robin section lasts for four days, at the end of which the team with the most points in each group advances to the quarter-finals. In addition, the top two scoring second-place teams from across the groups will also advance, leaving eight teams in total.</p>
      <p>Those eight then play against each other in a series of matches in a standard quarter-final, semi-final, final format to crown a final winner.</p>
      <h3>Davis Cup Finals groups</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Group A: France, Japan, Serbia</li>
        <li>Group B: Croatia, Russia, Spain</li>
        <li>Group C: Argentina, Chile, Germany</li>
        <li>Group D: Belgium, Colombia, Australia</li>
        <li>Group E: Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Great Britain</li>
        <li>Group F: Italy, Canada, United States</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to watch and stream live in the UK</h3>
      <p>Eurosport 1 is the official UK broadcaster for the Davis Cup final this year, which you can watch either on TV or on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3683797-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-davis-cup-3683797%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurosportplayer.com%2F">Eurosport website</a> or app.</p>
      <p>You'll need to be a subscriber though, with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3683797-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-davis-cup-3683797%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.eurosportplayer.com%2Fproduct">prices from £6.99 per month</a> or £39.99 for a year. Eurosport is also available as part of <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=11005&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3683797-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fshop%2Ftv%2F">Sky TV's Entertainment package</a> - ideal if you're already a subscriber or are tempted by one of its Black Friday offers.</p>
      <p>Here's the UK TV schedule::</p>
      <p><b>Monday 18th November</b>: 3:00pm – 9:00pm<br/><b>Tuesday 19th – Saturday 23rd November</b>: 10:00am – 11:00pm<br/><b>Sunday 24th November</b>: 3:00pm – 9:00pm</p>
      <p>The other option is to watch online with a subscription to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3683797-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-davis-cup-3683797%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvideo.daviscup.com%2Fpricing">official Davis Cup online player</a> (which also lets you watch the women's Fed Cup). That'll cost you €4.99 to watch a single tie, €7.99 for a round, or €39.99 to watch every Davis Cup and Fed Cup match over the next 12 months.</p>
      <h3>How to watch and stream live in the US</h3>
      <p>Fox Sports is the official broadcaster in the US, so that will probably be the easiest way to watch along live, whether on TV or streaming from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3683797-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-davis-cup-3683797%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxsports.com%2F">Fox's online player</a>. Remember that matches will take place in Spain, so most of the tennis will take place in the morning in the US.</p>
      <p>Alternatively you can watch online with a subscription to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3683797-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-davis-cup-3683797%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvideo.daviscup.com%2Fpricing">official Davis Cup online player</a> (which also lets you watch the women's Fed Cup). That'll cost you €4.99 to watch a single tie, €7.99 for a round, or €39.99 to watch every Davis Cup and Fed Cup match over the next 12 months.</p>
