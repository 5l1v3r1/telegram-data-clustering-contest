      <p>Los Blancos are looking to consolidate their position as title challengers this season by bolstering their squad during the January transfer window, and have reportedly identified a Portuguese playmaker as a potential target.</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane's side is said to be interested in Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Ruben Neves, who has been one of the standout players in the Premier League over the past year and a half.</p>
      <p>Real have a battle on their hands to sign the 22-year-old, however, as Wolves' head of recruitment John Marshall has issued a hands-off warning to all potential suitors.</p>

      <p>"… He is a real top player," Marshall said, as reported by <i>Birmingham Live.</i></p>
      <p>"We are aware of the fact that so many top clubs follow him around Europe but we are focusing on him.</p>
      <p>"He is not for sale."</p>
      <p>Neves is an international teammate of Real's all-time leading goalscorer Ronaldo, and was part of the Portugal squad that won the UEFA Nations League title earlier in the year.</p>

      <p>He joined then-Championship side Wolves from FC Porto in 2017, and helped the club earn promotion to the Premier League ahead of the 2018/19 campaign. He has scored 14 goals in 102 appearances for the English club in total.</p>
