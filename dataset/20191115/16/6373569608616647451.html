      <h1>Comedian Brian Conley on Brexit, broccoli and starring in Plymouth's upcoming pantomime</h1>
      <h2>Brian told Plymouth Live he's looking forward to returning to the city - and wishes we'd 'just get on with Brexit'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:40:29+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Dowrick</a></address>
      <p>Popular comedian and star of Theatre Royal Plymouth's 2019 pantomime 'Cinderella', Brian Conley is excited to be returning to the city, he says.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Plymouth Live, the actor and television star gave an insight into what audiences can expect from the exciting production - and said if he had one wish from a fairy godmother, he'd want to end Brexit.</p>
      <p>Brian, who is perhaps best known as the host of his very own 'The Brian Conley Show' and as the presenter of the Royal Variety Performance, has been starring in the West End production of 9 to 5 the Musical for several months.</p>
      <p>Now, he's set to return to Plymouth, starring in Cinderella at Theatre Royal Plymouth from December 20 2019.</p>
      <p>Brian Conley has loved performing in 9 to 5 the Musical in London, he says, and he's 'very honoured' to have met legendary country singer Dolly Parton, who wrote the amazing soundtrack to the show.</p>

      <p>Brian told Plymouth Live he's 'really enjoying' performing in the show, which tells a 'great story' of three young girls who collaborate to overthrow their sexist and pompous boss.</p>
      <p>But he's really excited to be returning to Plymouth to star in the city's biggest festive production, the pantomime Cinderella.</p>
      <p>With a career spanning over 40 years, Brian Conley is a well-loved and respected figure in showbiz and told Plymouth Live he still loves performing in pantomimes and giving audiences the laughs and smiles they want.</p>
      <p>"I genuinely enjoy doing it," he said, "Pantomimes are what people want.</p>
      <p>"I'm very excited to be returning [to Plymouth] and everyone knows the story of Cinderella," he said.</p>
      <p>Brian told Plymouth Live: "Cinderella is a special pantomime because it's traditional."</p>
      <p>"We have a wonderful cast, they're all top-notch. The show is something people can enjoy as a family, it's really family-friendly," he added.</p>
      <p>Pantomimes are for everyone, Brian says, suiting the whole age range from a three-year-old child to a 90-year-old adult.</p>
      <p>Brian joked that the Theatre Royal Plymouth version of the Cinderella pantomime is 'like Shrek,' as the show incorporates pop songs and actors joke about the current era we live in, like in 'Shrek The Musical,' and so Cinderella is sure to get both children and adults laughing and singing along.</p>
      <p>The scenery for the production is impressive too, he says.</p>
      <p>Brian told Plymouth Live: "There's an incredible set [for Cinderella] made by Theatre Royal."</p>
      <p>Plymouth Live also asked Brian for his views on some of the classic magical moments in Cinderella.</p>
      <p>We asked him what wish he would like granted by a fairy godmother - and his reply had us in stitches.</p>
      <p>Brian said: "[I'd wish] for health and happiness for my family and for everyone.</p>
      <p>"And can we just get on with Brexit? I'm sick of it." he added.</p>
      <p>In Cinderella, a pumpkin is turned into a carriage, so Plymouth Live also asked Brian 'If you could turn a vegetable into something else, what would you change?'</p>
      <p>Brian said he'd changed broccoli into strawberries - perhaps not the most exciting use of magic!</p>

      <p>Brian said he will spend Christmas in Plymouth this year and is looking forward to spending time with his family.</p>
      <p>While, he "can't really go out" due to the intense commitment of rehearsals and performances, he and his family will relax in Plymouth and spend quality family-time together over the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>"When I have time off, I want to do as little as possible! Just spend time with family," he said.</p>
      <p>While in Plymouth Brian enjoys exploring the barbican, particularly the quirky independent 'trinket shops', and spending time on the hoe, he said.</p>
      <p>He has previously performed at Theatre Royal Plymouth as popular American showman PT Barnum in the UK tour of Barnum in 2015, and as the notorious Fagin in Oliver! The Musical, which came to Plymouth in 2012.</p>
      <p>Brian Conley will return to Plymouth in Cinderella at Theatre Royal Plymouth, from Friday, December 20 2019 to Saturday, January 18 2020.</p>
