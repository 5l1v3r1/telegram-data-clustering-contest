      <p>An antilock brake actuator pump can leak onto a circuit board, causing electrical shorts and fires. Because of the risk, Nissan recommends owners park the vehicles outside and away from buildings if the antilock brake light is on for more than 10 seconds. </p>
      <p>The recall covers 2015 to 2018 Nissan Murano SUVs, 2016 to 2018 Maxima sedans and 2017 to 2019 Infiniti QX60 and Nissan Pathfinder SUVs, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2018/NISSAN/MAXIMA/4%252520DR/FWD#recalls">according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.</p>
      <p>This is the second recall for some of the same vehicles. In 2018, Nissan dealers inspected parts but did not replace the pumps if fluid wasn't leaking.</p>
      <p>Dealers will now replace pumps on all of the vehicles.</p>
