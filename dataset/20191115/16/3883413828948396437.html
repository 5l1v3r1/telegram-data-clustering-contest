      <p>The largest intake of Gurkhas ever trained at Catterick has passed out in a ceremony in North Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Family and friends watched on as recruits marched on the parade square and made the step up as fully-fledged Gurkha riflemen.</p>
      <p>The ceremony, although hampered by torrential rain, marked the end of nine months of intense infantry training.</p>

      <p>Rifleman Dipesh Deuja said: "Everybody was watching us and it was so freezing... but still... we have to enjoy this day.</p>
      <p>"I feel really proud today."</p>
      <p>"After being selected in the British Army, I was really imagining this day," said Rifleman Posan Uchai.</p>
      <p>The recruits <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/highest-number-gurkhas-over-three-decades-arrive-uk">moved to England from Nepal in February</a> after a gruelling selection process in Pokhara. </p>
      <p>Four hundred were selected - double the usual number of around 200 who have been trained yearly at Catterick in recent times.</p>

      <p>The recruits have not only had to learn soldiering skills but also a new language and culture, as well as the weight of extra independence.</p>
      <p>Rifleman Shivraj Gurung said: "I think I've probably changed a lot because after nine months when I will see my mum and dad, they will be very surprised like 'my son has changed a lot'.</p>
      <p>"Taking responsibilities... ironing, polishing the shoes.</p>
      <p>"[My mother] will be happy." </p>
      <p>All but one of the original 400 recruits passed out at the ceremony in North Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>The remaining trainee rifleman will have to wait a couple of months as he recovers from a broken leg.</p>

      <p>Major Rajesh Kumar Gurung, Officer Commanding, said: "It is a big day... nine months of challenges and rollercoasters.</p>
      <p>"Straight from the streets of Nepal, coming all the way [to the UK], receiving the best training in the British Army, probably the best training Army in the world.</p>
      <p>"They are absolutely professional, they are absolutely ready to deploy - I'm probably the proudest Officer Commanding in the entire British Army right now."</p>
      <p>The next step in the riflemen's British Army journey will be 'Dispersal Day' where they will head off to their new regiments.</p>
      <p>Next year, the instructors at Gurkha Company will be even busier with the number of recruits expected to rise again to 432.</p>
