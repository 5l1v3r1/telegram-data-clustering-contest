      <p>NEW YORK (Nov 15): Wall Street's main indexes hit fresh record highs on Friday, led by gains in technology stocks as upbeat comments related to U.S.-China trade talks and solid earnings from semiconductor industry bellwether Applied Materials brightened sentiment.</p>
      <p>Shares in Applied Materials Inc jumped 9.2% and pushed the Philadelphia Semiconductor index to an all-time high after the chip gear maker forecast first-quarter results above estimates.</p>
      <p>Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were higher. The trade-sensitive technology sector rose 0.5%, providing the biggest boost.</p>
      <p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Thursday that the world's two largest economies were getting close to a trade agreement, citing what he called very constructive talks with Beijing.</p>
      <p>Adding to the upbeat mood, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said there would be a call between U.S. and Chinese officials later on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We have been here so many times where the market gets its hopes up and then it gets crushed," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p>
      <p>"But certainly with an election coming up next year, you would want to have all these things behind you, so a mini-deal or a trade truce makes a lot of sense."</p>
      <p>Data showed U.S. retail sales rebounded in October, but consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items and clothing, which could temper expectations for a strong holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>The report comes a day after the benchmark S&amp;P hit an all-time closing high following robust earnings from retail giant Walmart Inc.</p>
      <p>Wall Street's main indexes have been powered recently by hopes of a trade deal, largely better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>At 10:15 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 107.75 points or 0.39% at 27,889.71, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 10.97 points or 0.35% at 3,107.60. The Nasdaq Composite was up 38.97 points or 0.46% at 8,517.99.</p>
      <p>Qualcomm Inc gained 2% after Mizuho upgraded its rating on the stock to "buy" from "neutral".</p>
      <p>But Nvidia Corp fell 3.3%, as the company said it expects its gaming chip business to be impacted by seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.70-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P index recorded 39 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 62 new lows.</p>
