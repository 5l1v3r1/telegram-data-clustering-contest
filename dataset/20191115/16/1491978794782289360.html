        <i>Alden Bryce Barlow wrote to MP saying she would be murdered like Jo Cox</i>
      </p>
      <p>A man who sent a threatening letter to the MP Anna Soubry telling her that she would be murdered like Jo Cox has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Alden Bryce Barlow, 55, from Doncaster, sent the Nottinghamshire MP a message reading “COX WAS FIRST YOU ARE NEXT”. The letter arrived at Soubry’s constituency office in Broxtowe on 14 October and was opened by a member of staff, the Crown Prosecution Service said.</p>
      <p>At Sheffield crown court, Barlow admitted sending a letter conveying a threatening message and was sentenced to 12 months in jail. He was also given a 10-year restraining order covering Soubry, who is standing as a candidate for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/independent-group-for-change">Independent Group for Change</a> in the general election.</p>
      <p>Barlow was traced using fingerprint analysis and CCTV from the post office counter in Doncaster where he posted the letter.</p>
      <p>Soubry was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/23/hard-right-captured-tory-party-boris-johnson-victory-proves-it">previously a Conservative</a> and had several ministerial jobs under David Cameron.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor in the case, Gerry Wareham, called the note “sickening” and “ominous” and described it as an “attack on democracy”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Ms Soubry and her staff in the constituency office understandably found the message deeply disturbing and highly offensive. I hope the sentence Barlow received today is of some comfort to Ms Soubry and her colleagues and a deterrent to anyone else contemplating such despicable actions against a parliamentary representative or candidate.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jo-cox">Cox</a> was the Labour MP for Batley and Spen when she was stabbed and shot outside a constituency surgery in Birstall, West Yorkshire, in 2016.</p>
