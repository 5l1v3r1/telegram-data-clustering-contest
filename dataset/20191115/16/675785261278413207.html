      <p>She has opened up about how her children have greater fears about her "dying" because of her age.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</a>  star, 52, is sure to make her children proud as she heads into the jungle this weekend but previously confessed her concerns about being an older parent.</p>
      <p>The iconic TV host is mum to Darcey, 13, and William, 10, with her politician husband Derek Draper.</p>

      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lorraine-kelly">Lorraine Kelly</a> in 2017, Kate revealed Darcey shared with her that she's "worried" about Kate being older than her friends' mums.</p>
      <p>She said: "We were talking about my age and me being an older mum the other day and I just asked what she thought of me being an older mum compared to some of her other friends.</p>
      <p>"She did say for the first time ever, 'I wish you were younger because I just worry that you might die sooner'."</p>

      <p>As the GMB veteran promoted her book The Joy Of Big Knickers, Kate confessed her feelings as she approached her milestone 50th birthday.</p>
      <p>She continued: "There’s now more pressure to take my health seriously. You have a different focus sometimes, so maybe the issues I’ve been discussing she’s been thinking about.</p>
      <p>"This is the right time for me to be a mum."</p>
      <p>Kate's doubts about being a mum come after the star chose to back a campaign to encourage women to think about having children at a younger age - before leaving it too late.</p>

      <p>She previously said: "I do look back now and realise that leaving pregnancy late can be a risky bet as diminishing fertility can stack the odds against you.</p>
      <p>"In some ways I wish I’d had my babies younger. Now I would love a third child but I’ve almost certainly left it too late."</p>
      <p>Kate is already in Australia on lock down before heading into the jungle when the show begins this Sunday.</p>
      <p>The reality star will be living with camp mates including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> , Nadine Coyle, Ian Wright and Roman Kemp.</p>

      <p>Her GMB co stars made a sweet gesture of support as they panned across to show a camera in the studio bearing the message "VOTE KATE" on today's episode of the show.</p>
      <p>The future campmates all met on yacht together recently, where they were handed yummy cocktails and plenty of opportunities for showbiz meet-and-greet kisses.</p>
      <p>The gang looked to have hit it off with them all pictured with smiles on their faces ahead of their entry into the jungle.</p>
