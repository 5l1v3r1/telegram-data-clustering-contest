      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - A light wind regime will continue as a cold front approaches Kauai from the northwest and a low level trough moves into the Big Island from the southeast.</p>
      <p>Expect land and sea breezes for all islands today and tonight with increasing shower activity over Kauai and the Big Island through the afternoon hours.</p>
      <p>Returning trade winds will help to spread clouds and showers to Oahu and Maui County on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Expect wet unsettled weather to linger into the middle of next week with moderate trade winds in the forecast.</p>
      <p><b>High surf advisory </b>remains in effect through this afternoon for north-facing shores of most islands, as well as west facing shores of Kauai and Niihau. In addition, a <b>small craft advisory</b> remains in effect for all waters exposed to the large north-northwest swell, including the Kauai and Kaiwi Channels.</p>
      <p>As the current north-northwest swell gradually fades during the next 24 hours, an even larger west-northwest swell is expected to arrive late tonight. This will cause surf to again reach the high surf advisory criteria along most north- and west-facing shores of the smaller islands starting Saturday.</p>
      <p>This swell may be large enough to approach the high surf warning thresholds along some shorelines from Saturday night into Sunday.</p>
