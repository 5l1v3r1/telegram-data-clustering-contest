      <h1>ECB's Visco: European single currency needs to interact with a single fiscal policy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:01:30+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>While speaking at a conference in Rome earlier in the day, "European single currency needs to interact with a single fiscal policy," <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/ecb">European Central Bank</a> governing council member Ignazio Visco argued, as reported by Reuters.</p>
      <p>"The small and uncertain benefits of a debt restructuring mechanism must be weighed against the huge risk that the mere announcement of its introduction may trigger a perverse spiral of expectations of default, which may prove to be self-fulfilling," Visco further added in his prepared remarks, which were largely ignored by market participants.</p>
