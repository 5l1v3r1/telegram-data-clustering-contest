      <p>The music and light spectacular, Fantasia, is returning to the Maldon Promenade on July 25 next year having brought more than 10,000 to the Essex town in the 2000s.</p>
      <p>Now returning in 2020, the show will be headlined by Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet fame, now performing solo, and bringing a back catalogue of hits including Gold, True and Through The Barricades.</p>
      <p>Also performing are supergroup Boyzlife, featuring Boyzone's Keith Duffy and Westlife's Brian McFadden, as well as both bands biggest hits.</p>
      <p>Joining them are hit-makers from across the decades, including 70s soul outfit Odyssey, who are still going strong more than 40 years after forming.</p>
      <p>Peter Andre will be at the park, best known for his iconic single, Mysterious Girl, along with the reformed S Club, with three of the original line-up (Jo, Bradley and Tina) performing the group's much-loved noughties pop songs.</p>
      <p>On top of those, the show features two top tributes, The Absolute Bowie Band and Spice Girls tribute Wannabe,</p>
      <p>Stitching the show together will be host Rylan Clark-Neal, who is currently dazzling audiences with his smile on BBC Two's Strictly Come Dancing chat show, It Takes Two.</p>
