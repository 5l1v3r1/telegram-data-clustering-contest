      <h1>Facebook tests mini Instagram-like feed built into the News Feed</h1>
      <h2>We heard you like Instagram so we put an Instagram inside your Facebook</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:41:15+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/jonathan-lamont" target="_blank">Jonathan Lamont</a></address>
      <p>Facebook is building a mini version of Instagram inside of itself just in case you wanted two image-centric algorithmic feeds to scroll through.</p>
      <p>Discovered by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/facebook-popular-photos/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a>, the new feed — dubbed ‘Popular Photos’ — began testing back in October. Since then, Facebook concluded the trial, but a spokesperson told <i>TechCrunch </i>that it plans to do updated tests in the future.</p>
      <p>Popular Photos works similarly to Facebook’s ‘<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/07/facebook-mobile-video/">Related Videos</a>‘ feature. It appears when users open a photo and allows them to keep scrolling through photos. Currently, if you open a photo from the News Feed in the Facebook app, swiping on it will close it. Popular Photos will allow you to scroll through an Instagram-like feed of pictures instead.</p>
      <p>Further, Popular Photos only shows a limited amount of text in the captions — users will only see about 65 characters — and generally keeps the interface clean of everything save images. There are also ‘Like’ and ‘Comment’ buttons beneath each picture. The interface appears on a black background that emphasizes the images.</p>

      <p>While the initial test didn’t include advertisements, considering its similarity to Related Videos (which shows ads), I’d expect Facebook to monetize Popular Photos similarly.</p>
      <p><i>TechCrunch </i>suggests Popular Photos will be a less exhausting way to browse Facebook. Users won’t have to deal with lengthy status messages, links and other content. Instead, it’ll just be photos.</p>
      <p>Facebook hasn’t been shy when it comes to copying features and leveraging Instagram to benefit itself. The company copied things like Stories from Snapchat and brought them to both <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2017/06/20/instagram-stories-surpass-snapchat-250-million-daily-users/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/05/17/facebook-stories-150-million-active-users/">Facebook</a>. Plus, the social network recently added an ‘Open Facebook’ button to Instagram and used it to push Facebook notifications to the other platform.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the company’s <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/04/facebook-new-logo-company-app/">new Facebook branding</a> has spread to Instagram, as well as WhatsApp, making it clear that both platforms are part of it.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, a new way to browse content on Facebook may prove useful to those who still consistently use the platform. I don’t think ripping off Instagram will win back any of the younger crowd, which has mostly abandoned Facebook in favour of apps like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.</p>
