      <p>A man who sent a “sickening” letter to an MP, suggesting she would be murdered like Jo Cox, has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Anna Soubry was sent the post, which read “COX WAS FIRST YOU ARE NEXT”, by Alden Bryce Barlow, 55, from Doncaster.</p>
      <p>The letter arrived at Ms Soubry’s constituency office in Broxtowe, Nottingham, on October 14 this year and was opened by a member of staff, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.</p>
      <p>Barlow admitted sending a letter conveying a threatening message and was sentenced to 12 months in jail at Sheffield Crown Court.</p>
      <blockquote>Ms Soubry and her staff in the constituency office understandably found the message deeply disturbing and highly offensive<cite>Chief Crown prosecutor Gerry Wareham</cite></blockquote>
      <p>He was also given a 10-year restraining order against Ms Soubry, who is standing as a candidate for The Independent Group for Change (TIGfC) in the General Election.</p>
      <p>Barlow was traced using fingerprint analysis and CCTV from the post office counter in Doncaster where he posted the letter.</p>
      <p>Ms Soubry, leader of the TIGfC, was previously a Conservative and had several ministerial jobs under David Cameron.</p>
      <p>Chief Crown prosecutor Gerry Wareham called the note “sickening” and “ominous” and described it as an “attack on democracy”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Ms Soubry and her staff in the constituency office understandably found the message deeply disturbing and highly offensive.</p>
      <p>“I hope the sentence Barlow received today is of some comfort to Ms Soubry and her colleagues and a deterrent to anyone else contemplating such despicable actions against a parliamentary representative or candidate.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Cox was Labour MP for Batley and Spen when she was stabbed and shot outside a constituency surgery in Birstall, West Yorkshire, in 2016.</p>
