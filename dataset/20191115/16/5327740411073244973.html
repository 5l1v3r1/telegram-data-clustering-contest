      <h1>Princeton couple pays for dream vacation with 840,000 grocery store points</h1>
      <h2>It’s easy if you know what you are doing, they say</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:28:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/andrea-demeer/" target="_blank">Andrea DeMeer</a></address>
      <p>A Princeton couple recently took “the trip of a lifetime,” a two-week, all-inclusive stay at a luxurious Cuban resort, and they paid for it all using their Save-on More points.</p>
      <p>“It was amazing,” said Jo-Anne Roth. “We hadn’t had a holiday in 17 years.”</p>
      <p>Roth began strategically collecting points about four years ago. She accumulated 840,000 points, which covered all the costs of the trip, valued at about $3,800.</p>
      <p>The rewards program covered everything from airfare, food, alcohol and bus rides, to a Vancouver hotel, and health insurance.</p>
      <p>With the trip paid for, Roth and her husband Andy were able to purchase extras, like a cruise and a jeep safari.</p>
      <p>Roth, a former Save-On employee, said she collected points for years. “And I spent them stupidly, on milk or whatever.”</p>
      <p>When she began watching the store flyers and taking advantage of points events, she realized it could turn into big bucks.</p>
      <p>Roth routinely purchases items when they come with bonus points, and schedules her store visits to maximize incentives.</p>
      <p>For example, if the store is offering points for a $50 purchase but she needs $100 worth of groceries, she will spend $50 one day, and $50 the next.</p>
      <p>“I think that people can really benefit from points, be they Save-on points or Optimum points or whatever, it’s worth it.”</p>
      <p>Roth has already collected 50,000 new points.</p>
      <p>“I’ll save them up again and then sit back and think of what I want to do.”</p>
