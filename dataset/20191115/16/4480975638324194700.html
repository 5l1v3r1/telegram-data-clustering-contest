      <h1>EUR/JPY ends five-day negative streak and rises back above 120.00</h1>

          <b>Euro erases most of weekly losses against Japanese yen, rising almost 80 pips from yesterday’s low. </b>

          <b>Yen among worst performers amid rising equity prices and a stabilization in US yields. </b>

      <p>The EUR/JPY pair is rising sharply on Friday, following five consecutive days of losses. An improvement in risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> helped the pair moved off monthly lows and regained 120.00. </p>
      <h3>Euro finds support as Yen weakens </h3>
      <p>Wall Street indexes are higher today, trading at daily highs at moment with gains around 0.40%. At the same time US yields remain steady, following days of sharp declines. Those moves weakened the demand for the Japanese yen that is among the worst performers. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">The euro</a> found support today and the rebound of the EUR/USD back above 1.1050 added more momentum to EUR/JPY. The pair is having the best performance in more than a month and in a few hours trimmed most of this week losses. </p>
      <h4>Technical outlook </h4>
      <p>Yesterday EUR/JPY bottomed at 119.22, the lowest level in a months. Since then it has risen almost a hundred pips. It is trading at 120.15, testing the 20-day moving average and also Wednesday’s high. If the pair consolidates at current or higher level it could signal that a short-term bottom is in place. Above 120.15/20 the next <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> level might be seen at 120.35 followed by 120.55. </p>
      <p>On the flip side, if the pair fails to break above 120.15 in the coming session, a correction seems likely. The critical immediate support might be seen at 119.80; a break lower would clear a slide to the next support at 119.55 (Nov 13 low). </p>
