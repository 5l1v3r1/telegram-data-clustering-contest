      <p>Bandai Namco has announced that One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows will release on February 28th, 2020. In order to celebrate this announcement, the publisher released a brand new trailer that you can find below.</p>
      <p>In this new fighting game, players will learn hero skills and complete missions as a pro hero in the Hero Association and climb the ranks to become an S-Class hero in the main story, based on the first season of the ONE PUNCH MAN anime.</p>
      <p>Players can also battle with powerful characters such as Metal Knight, Stinger, and Melzargard in over-the-top clashes true to the ONE PUNCH MAN world. Powerful villains may also show up during battle and disrupt the fight in events; these villains include King, a character so intimidating that he causes everyone but Saitama to freeze in battle.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s also worth noting that the game will include both English and Japanese voiceover.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
