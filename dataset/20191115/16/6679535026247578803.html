      <p>Former Minister A.H. Vishwanath on Friday said that he agreed to join the BJP because of V. Srinivas Prasad, veteran Dalit leader and Chamarajanagar MP.</p>
      <p>On his first visit to the BJP office in Mysuru on Friday, Mr. Vishwanath disclosed the behind-the-scenes developments prior to the enmasse resignations by coalition MLAs in July. He said Mr. Prasad, with whom he enjoyed a close rapport, had invited him to his residence and asked him to take the lead in establishing a BJP government in the State, with B.S. Yediyurappa at the helm. “He told me to quit as JD(S) State unit president and take the lead in bringing the BJP to power. I immediately agreed,” Mr. Vishwanath said, before adding that the two spoke to Mr. Yeddiyurappa immediately thereafter.</p>
      <p>Mr. Vishwanath said that he was told that the BJP’s objective would be achieved if a leader like him came forward and took a firm decision. He gave Mr. Prasad the entire credit for installation of the BJP government in the State.</p>
      <p>Mr. Vishwanath, who joined the BJP formally in Bengaluru on Thursday, visited Chamundeshwari Temple atop Chamundi Hills in Mysuru on Friday before visiting the party office in Mysuru to participate in the Kanaka Jayanti celebrations.</p>
      <p>Mr. Prasad, however, downplayed his role in establishing the BJP government in the State by claiming that the Congress-JD(S) coalition collapsed on account of the “mistrust and misunderstanding” between the leaders of the two parties.</p>
      <p>Acknowledging his friendship with Mr. Vishwanath, Mr. Prasad said the former had resigned as MLA representing Hunsur as former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had been “humiliating” him. No reaction</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Siddaramaiah, who was also in Mysuru on Friday to participate in the Kanaka Jayanti procession, refused to react to statements made by Mr. Vishwanath.</p>
