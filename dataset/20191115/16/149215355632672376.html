      <p>Fox News doesn't seem to think the second day of impeachment hearings is going great for President Trump so far.</p>
      <p>Chris Wallace, in particular, praised ousted Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch's "powerful" testimony describing how she felt devastated after Trump trashed her as "bad news" on a call with a foreign leader and after being pushed out of her position due to what she characterized as smears by Rudy Giuliani and others.</p>
      <p>"I think if you are not moved by the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch today, you don't have a pulse," Wallace said.</p>
      <p>Wallace went on to highlight Yovanovitch's description of her dismissal despite more than 30 years of experience under multiple presidents and the deputy secretary of state telling her she did nothing wrong.</p>
      <p>Trump publicly attacked Yovanovitch on Twitter during the hearing, <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878725/fox-news-bret-baier-suggests-trump-just-broke-law-realtime-tweeted-attacks-yovanovitch">leading Fox News' Bret Baier to say</a> we may have seen an article of impeachment being added in real-time. Wallace agreed, <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1195367037641666562">saying Friday</a>, "it does raise the possibility of witness intimidation and witness tampering as a new charge here."</p>
      <p>Former independent counsel Ken Starr also appeared Friday on Fox News to criticize Trump's tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/poniewozik/status/1195369929811406855">saying</a> it showed "extraordinarily poor judgment." Brendan Morrow</p>
