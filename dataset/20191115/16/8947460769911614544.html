      <p>Initially, Schot had been acting only in a provisional role because former Audi CEO Rupert Stadler was investigated for several months as part of the diesel scandal.</p>
      <p>The former BMW board member Markus Duesmann will take on a difficult task in April 2020 with the company still dealing with the effects of the diesel scandal, while embarking on a costly and long electric vehicles journey.</p>
      <p><b>Dr. Herbert Diess (Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Audi AG):</b> “As an excellent engineer, Markus Duesmann will make every effort to increase the great potential of the Audi brand and thus once again demonstrate the promise of ‘Vorsprung durch Technik’.</p>
      <p>He [Bram Schot] took over the leadership of AUDI AG in a difficult time, managed the business very successfully and initiated important changes. We expressly thank him for that. ”</p>
      <p><b>Peter Mosch (Chairman of the Works Council of Audi AG and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board):</b> “We expect a stable capacity utilization of the plants and more courage to take advantage of technology through Markus Duesmann and his Executive Board team.</p>
      <p>We look forward to a good cooperation in the interest of the employees and the company. [Bram Schot was] The right man at the right time at Audi. He heralded a change in culture, towards fewer hierarchies, a clear system of values ​​and more openness. In the middle of 2018, Schot took over responsibility for the company in a very difficult situation. ”</p>
