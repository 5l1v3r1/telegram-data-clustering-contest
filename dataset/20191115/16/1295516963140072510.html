      <p>Following two big screen adaptations, writer/artist Frank Miller's neo-noir graphic novel series <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/sin-city/">Sin City</a> is headed to television.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/sin-city-tv-series-frank-miller-robert-rodriguez-legendary-television-1202787314/">Deadline</a>, Legendary Television has closed a deal with Miller to turn <i>Sin City</i> into a television series. Moreover, <a href="https://screenrant.com/films-robert-rodriguez-ranked/">Robert Rodriguez</a> is reportedly in talks to return to the franchise as well. Miller and Rodriguez co-directed the 2005 film <i>Sin City</i> and its 2014 sequel <i>Sin City: A Dame to Kill For</i>.</p>

      <p>Both Miller and Rodriguez are expected to serve as executive producers on Legendary's new television series -- though it is unclear if they will also return to c0-direct. Stephen L’Heureux -- one of the producers on <i>A Dame to Kill For </i>-- and Silenn Thomas --who runs Miller's production company -- will also produce.</p>

      <p>Miller's deal with Legendary reportedly guarantees at least one season for the <i>Sin City</i> television show, provided they are also able to strike a deal television network or streaming platform. The deal also calls for an "hard-R" <i>Sin City</i> animated prequel series based on the original comics.</p>

      <p>The film and television rights to <i>Sin City</i> previously belonged to the Weinstein Company -- which was once developing a <i>Sin City</i> TV series <a href="https://www.cbr.com/sin-city-reboot-tv-series-frank-miller/">of its own</a>. In the wake of the company's bankruptcy, however, Miller <a href="https://www.cbr.com/frank-miller-sin-city-film-tv-rights/">reacquired the on-screen rights</a> to the property in the summer of 2018 -- which has apparently lead to this new deal with Legendary.</p>
      <p>Written and illustrated by Frank Miller, the <i>Sin City</i> series of graphic novels; comic book limited series; and one-shots was originally published by Dark Horse Comics from 1991 to 2000. Miller and Rodriguez's first film adaptation from 2005 proved rather popular, earning $158.8 million at the box office against a $40 million budget (though the 2014 sequel was far less successful.)</p>
