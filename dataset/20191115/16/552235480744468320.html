      <h2>Council asks parents to make sure their details are up-to-date with schools</h2>

      <p>West Lothian’s 31,000 pupils, their parents and carers are being urged to get ready for winter</p>
      <p>Families are being urged to make sure they know what to do in bad weather</p>
      <p>Head of education, Jim Cameron, said: “One of the most important actions for parents and carers to do is check that their child’s school has up-to-date contact details so that messages via GroupCall can be communicated effectively.</p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>“GroupCall is the first method of communication in the event of a closure or school disruption</p>
      <p>He added: “Parents/carers should also note that it’s their responsibility to decide on whether their child should travel to school during winter weather. It’s not for the school staff to tell parents whether their child should come to school unless, of course, the decision has been taken to close the school.”</p>
