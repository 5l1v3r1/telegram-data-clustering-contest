      <p>The Borno State Commissioner of Environment, Kabiru Wanori, on Friday, announced plans by the state government to rehabilitate the 42-year Maiduguri Zoological Garden.</p>
      <p>Wanori told the <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> in Maiduguri that the zoological garden would be restocked and upgraded, in line with international standard.</p>
      <p>He disclosed that the state government had adopted proactive measures to reinvigorate the garden, encourage tourism development and boost its revenue base.</p>
      <p>Wanori explained that the moribund zoological garden would be stocked with various animal species of reptiles, monkeys, cats and birds, among others.</p>
      <p>“Some of the ageing animals, such as lions, monkeys, hyenas, elephants and leopards were not replaced in the past.</p>
      <p>“The zoological garden lost some of its precious animals, including buffaloes, rhinos and giraffes. We have a special place where their biographies are kept for interested visitors.</p>
      <p>“Rehabilitation of the zoological garden will encourage wildlife conservation, tourism, generate employment opportunities and boost the state revenue base,” Wanori said.</p>
      <p>He noted that the number of visitors to the zoo had dropped drastically in the last 10 years due to the lack of animals and insurgency.</p>
      <p>The commissioner added that the rehabilitation effort would lead to the upgrade of the zoological garden and enhance its operations.</p>
