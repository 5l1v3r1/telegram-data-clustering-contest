      <h1>The Year of La Rosalía Continues With 5 Latin Grammy Wins</h1>

      <p>Rosalía’s career<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/doja-cat-normani-rosalia-won-the-week-in-music-videos.html"> just keeps rising</a> — “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bfOZek9t4">con altura</a>,” if you will. Last night, Spain’s breakout flamenco pop star dominated the Latin Grammys with five wins for her work, including three in her own name: album of the year and best contemporary pop vocal album <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/rosalas-radical-take-on-flamenco-found-worldwide-resonance.html">for 2018’s <i>El Mal Querer</i></a>, along with best urban song for “Con Altura,” released last March with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/j-balvin-bad-bunny-oasis-album-review.html">J. Balvin</a>. <i>El Mal Querer</i> also won awards for engineering and packaging. “We did this album sitting on the floor, with two computers, a keyboard and a microphone. I swear to God. And then, we worked on it for a year and a half. That was it,” Rosalía <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/rosal-wins-big-latin-grammys-celebrate-latin-music-s-past-n1082721">said in Spanish</a> when she accepted album of the year, taking off her sunglasses. “Winning a Grammy is the best thing that can ever happen.” She’s the first woman to win the award in over a decade, since Shakira in 2006. The prolific singer-songwriter also performed a medley of new release “A Palé” and “Con Altura” earlier in the night, further proving her dominance by holding the stage all by herself.
