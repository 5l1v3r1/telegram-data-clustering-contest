      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 15): Malaysia’s economic growth is forecast to ease slightly to 4.5 percent in 2020 from the 4.6 percent expected this year, said RAM Ratings today.</p>
      <p>It said the country’s economic resilience will rely heavily on domestic drivers in 2020 against the backdrop of a continually challenging external demand landscape.</p>
      <p>The current ebbing of global growth momentum shows little sign of being arrested any time soon as forward-looking external cyclical indicators remained weak and the world economy still faced the risks of rising trade protectionism as well as uncertain trade policy direction.</p>
      <p>The rating agency added that more emphasis on domestic demand-driven expansion, both monetary and fiscal policies will play an integral role as a buffer against downside risks, given the baseline expectation of lingering weakness in external growth.</p>
      <p>In light of the mildly growth-supportive Budget 2020, RAM Ratings said there was also a possibility of Bank Negara Malaysia cutting the overnight policy rate another 25 basis points to 2.75 percent next year.</p>
      <p>“Our expectation of further easing is premised on the potential risk of external downside risks filtering through to the domestic growth drivers of consumption and investment — the backbone of sustainable growth in 2020,” it said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the anticipated resilience of domestic-oriented sectors should contribute positively to the healthy 6.8 percent growth of private consumption next year, compared to the projected 7.3 percent for 2019.</p>
      <p>Private investment is forecast to expand 3.6 percent next year, from the projected 1.2 percent for 2019.</p>
      <p>“From our analysis of RAM Business Confidence Index (RAM BCI) data, domestic-oriented firms have been recording very stable readings in the last few quarters.</p>
      <p>“Over the last several years, the construction and services sectors, which are the most domestic-oriented, have been exhibiting high ratios of employee compensation to value-added output, as well as a lower variability in wage growth compared to those in the manufacturing sector,” said RAM Ratings.</p>
