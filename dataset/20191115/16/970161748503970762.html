      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s friend and former adviser Roger Stone has been convicted of lying to try and protect the president.</p>
      <p>Stone, 67, was found guilty Friday of obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>He was convicted at a court in Washington DC, close to where impeachment proceedings which could end President Trump’s time in the White House continue.</p>
      <p>He was charged after changing his story while giving evidence to the US government’s House Intelligence Committee in September 2017.</p>
      <p>Stone lied while giving evidence about Russian meddling in the presidential election, which Trump ultimately won.</p>

      <p>Stone, convicted of seven crimes in total, was also found to have tried to block the testimony of another potential witness, and concealing evidence for investigators.</p>

      <p>Jurors agreed with prosecutors that Stone had lied because the truth would have ‘looked terrible’ for both President Trump and his campaign, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/roger-stone-trial-guilty.html">New York Times</a> reported.</p>
      <p>They also disagreed with Stone’s brazen assertion at the time that ‘no one cares’ about his lies by convicting him of crimes likely to lead to a long stretch behind bars.</p>
      <p>He will be sentenced at a later date.</p>
      <p>Stone spent the months leading up to the November 2016 presidential election trying to obtain emails stolen by Russian hackers containing damaging information about Trump rival Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>He briefed Team Trump officials about the contents of these emails ‘every chance he got,’ prosecutor Jonathan Kravis Said.</p>
      <p>But Stone blustered after being called to the House Intelligence Committee, and ended up incriminating himself.</p>
      <p>He joins a long list of other former Trump aides convicted of crimes.</p>
      <p>They include the president’s former fixer Michael Cohen, convicted of financial crimes related to a hush money payment made to a porn star who claimed to have had a one night stand with Trump behind his wife Melania’s back.</p>
      <p>Others convicted include former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and former campaign aide George Papadopoulos.</p>
