      <p>Long before Daniel Radcliffe starred in 2012’s adaptation of Susan Hill’s 1983 horror novel <b><i>The Woman in Black</i></b>, and even before the novel was first adapted for the screen decades prior in 1989, <b>Stephen Mallatratt</b> turned the story into a stage play in the United Kingdom, which has become (via Wikipedia) “the second longest-running play in the history of the West End.”</p>
      <p>A staple in London, the play is returning to New York next year, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/londons-long-running-the-woman-in-black-play-to-make-new-york-debut-1202783608/">Deadline reports</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“An eight-week run of London’s endurable ghost play will begin previews January 8, with an official opening on January 23.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This will be the first time<i> The Woman in Black</i> has made her way to New York since 2001, and she’ll be taking over The McKittrick Hotel’s Club Car on 530 West 27th Street.</p>
      <p>Deadline notes, “<i>The Woman in Black</i> tells the story of a young lawyer who stumbles upon a small town with a grave secret. This staging will “weave” among and around the audience.”</p>
