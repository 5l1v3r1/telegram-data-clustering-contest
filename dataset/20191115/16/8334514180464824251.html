      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday released a summary of an April phone call in which President Donald Trump congratulated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on his election win.</p>
      <p>Trump had said repeatedly that Democrats wanted details of his April 21 call with Zelenskiy, but it has never been a focus of the lawmakers leading the impeachment probe of Trump on Capitol Hill.</p>
      <p>A separate call between the two leaders on July 25 sparked the impeachment inquiry. Democrats have said Trump abused the power of his office by pressing Zelenskiy to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>They have also accused him of withholding aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskiy into launching an investigation. Trump has denied the accusation.</p>
      <p>Trump, in the April call, invited Zelenskiy to the White House.</p>
      <p>“We’ll have a lot of things to talk about, but we’re with you all the way,” he said according to the memo.</p>
