      <p>A man who tried to kill a police officer as he responded to a call has been jailed for 10 years.</p>
      <p>Graeme Davidson, 37, attacked PC Derek Laing at a property in Fife in a drunken knife attack on June 29.</p>
      <p>Pc Derek was left ‘fighting for his life’ as Davidson ‘lunged and jumped’ at him with a knife measuring 3.5inches.</p>
      <p>The High Court in Glasgow heard the officer could have died if the blade was not stopped by the officer's breastbone, preventing it from reaching vital organs.</p>
      <p>The court also heard that since the incident, the officer has been "struggling to cope with the effects on his wife and young family" and has sought help.</p>

      <p>He was given an extended sentence comprising 10 years and three months in prison and three years on licence.</p>
      <p>Davidson admitted attempted murder and took full responsibility for the attack when he appeared in court last month.</p>
      <p>He also acknowledged the officer had not provoked a physical attack.</p>
      <p>Sentencing him, Lord Matthews, said: "Attempted murder is a serious enough crime in its own right but when the victim is a police officer carrying out his duties it is aggravated to a significant degree.</p>
      <p>"The community relies heavily on police officers who often put their lives at risk to protect us. The courts have in turn to protect them."</p>
      <p>At an earlier hearing, the court heard Davidson had been visiting his cousin the previous night and started drinking around 8.30pm, prompting a neighbour to call the police.</p>

      <p>Officers found Davidson alone and sleeping in a bedroom.</p>
      <p>Pc Derek tried to help Davidson find his clothes before leaving him sitting dressed on the bed.</p>
      <p>Davidson was not searched or placed in handcuffs.</p>
      <p>Pc Derek was stood in the hallway when Davidson came rushing towards him with his right hand raised and holding "a long, slender item".</p>
      <p>After the incident Pc Derek was taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, where he needed two stitches.</p>
      <p>The knife left a 1cm puncture wound that was superficial but could have been more significant.</p>
      <p>Iain Paterson, defending Davidson, said his client accepts "full responsibility" for what happened.</p>
      <p>He said: "Police had not gone to arrest Mr Davidson. He was not committing any crime, he was asleep and unfortunately intoxicated and having been woken up he did what he did. He accepts full responsibility for that."</p>
      <p>Superintendent Sandy Brodie, of Fife Division, said: "This was a vicious and cowardly attack on a police officer who was simply trying to do his job and serve his community.</p>
