      <h1>Toton school where only rule is to 'be kind' achieves outstanding praise</h1>
      <h2>It is one of the first in the country to be rated under the new 2019 Ofsted framework</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:27:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>Staff and pupils of a school described as a having 'a culture of kindness' have celebrated after receiving an outstanding report.</p>
      <p>Chetwynd Primary Academy in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/toton">Toton</a> has been highly complimented by inspectors who said pupil behaviour was "exemplary".</p>
      <p>Head teacher Lorraine Tonks, who joined the school in 2014, said the feedback had been "a dream come true" adding the only rule for the school was "be kind".</p>
      <p>"We were awarded gold status for our anti-bullying work last year," Lorraine added.</p>
      <p>"I think it's just about creating a culture out of it. It's simple for children if you only have one thing to remember. It's also modelled through staff and parents."</p>
      <p>Inspectors from Ofsted, the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">education</a> watchdog, visited the school over two days on October 1 and 2.</p>

      <p>All inspectors agreed the school showcased outstanding qualities, improving on its last inspection in 2014 when it was rated good.</p>
      <p>Inspectors said pupils are "extremely happy" and "cannot remember when any bullying last happened".</p>
      <p>The school was also praised for giving pupils "the best possible education".</p>
      <p>The report described Chetwynd as "a hive for learning" with teachers demonstrating "excellent subject knowledge".</p>
      <p>Pupils were encouraged to learn to read from their first week and as a result they "soon become fluent readers".</p>
      <p>Lorraine added there is an ethos of "keep up not catch up" that ensures children are supported in areas such as reading.</p>
      <p>"I've always strongly believed education is the key and that all school children, private or state, deserve the best possible teaching," she said.</p>
      <p>"We are lucky to be surrounded by brilliant staff. The first couple of years I was here were tricky. It has been a journey for everyone involved."</p>
      <p>The report stated the broader development of pupils was "exceptional" with leaders providing a "vast array of experiences".</p>
      <p>These include sports-based activities, drama and music clubs as well as a unique opportunity for students to broadcast the school's news in a podcast, known as Chetwynd Radio.</p>
      <p>For pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND) the inspectors also noted that expectations were not lowered by staff and they went on to "achieve exceptionally well".</p>

      <p>Lorraine said the inspectors "couldn't give us one thing to get better at" but that has not meant the school is not looking for ways to improve.</p>
      <p>"After the results came through, staff were already looking at more great ideas to develop," Lorraine said.</p>
      <p>"There are always elements we want to improve and we have also had an influx of requests for people to visit and learn from us.</p>
      <p>"We want to make sure other children get the same experience as Chetwynd, and will help to spread it widely."</p>
      <p>Chetwynd Primary is a Spencer Academies Trust school.</p>
      <p>Spencer Academies Trust director of primary education Angela O’Brien said: "This is one of the strongest school inspection reports we can recall.</p>
      <p>"Chetwynd has been recognised as something more than outstanding – as a genuinely exceptional and very special place to learn."</p>
      <p>Trust chief executive Paul West said: "We are delighted and very proud that Chetwynd has been recognised by Ofsted as an outstanding school</p>
      <p>"Lorraine and her team work incredibly hard to deliver the vision for the academy, all children achieve and succeed and Chetwynd has an incredibly supportive parent body."</p>
