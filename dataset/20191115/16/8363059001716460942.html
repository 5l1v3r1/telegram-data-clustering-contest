      <h1>Tesco's Christmas Ad Causes a Stir Before It Even Airs</h1>

      <p>It turns out that popping a van on the roof of a house garners a bit of attention.</p>
      <p>The people of Knutsford, an hilariously named town on the outskirts of Manchester, had a little bit of excitement this week with the appearance of a Tesco delivery van decked out in Christmas lights on the roof. Upon further investigation it seems that the event wasn't tied to a directionally challenged driver, but part of a Christmas ad for the supermarket.</p>
      <p>"Seeing one of our Tesco delivery vans sat on the roof of a cottage caught everyone by surprise this morning," said Tesco chief customer officer, Alessandra Bellini. "It is certainly not something you see every day, but I suspect that anyone watching ITV this Sunday night will have all their questions answered.”</p>
      <p>The advert will reportedly run this Sunday night, during I’m a Celebrity. Presumably Santa loses his reindeer in a close brush with a plane engine, and commandeered a Tesco van at candy cane point because someone has got to get those presents out.</p>
