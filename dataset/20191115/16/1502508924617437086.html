      <p>Reliance Capital on Friday said it has defaulted on interest and principal obligations on bonds due on November 15, 2019.</p>
      <p>On September 20, 2019, CARE Ratings (CARE) had downgraded the company's entire outstanding debt to default "CARE D" rating.</p>
      <p>Reliance Capital said the rating was downgraded even though there were no overdues on principal or interest payment to any lender.</p>
      <p>This rating downgrade has initiated acceleration, etc. of various facilities by certain lenders and consequential demands for immediate payment of amounts that were otherwise due and payable in a phased manner over the next eight years till March 2028, as per the original terms of lending, Reliance Capital had said earlier in October.</p>
      <p>"It is expected that the debt servicing of the company in relation to the accelerated amounts and otherwise will be delayed.</p>
      <p>"Accordingly, as regards the Non-Convertible Debenture, the interest/principal obligations due on November 15, 2019, is also delayed," it said.</p>
      <p>Reliance Capital shares closed at Rs 21.05, down 4.97 per cent on BSE on Friday.</p>
