      <p>Sometimes, and it's rare, there's a general consensus on an artist's magnum opus. <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Drake/profile">Drake</a> is one such artist, with many of his fans uniting in favor of 2011's <i>Take Care. </i>A complete swerve of the sophomore slump, Drizzy picked up where <i>Thank Me Later </i>left off like a man with a vengeance. With nineteen tracks on deck, it's difficult to narrow down a reigning champion. And yet our <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/drake-track-bracket-whats-your-favorite-drizzy-song-ever-news.95387.html">recent bracket challenge</a> found "Marvin's Room" emerging victorious as Drake's finest song to date, a high honor considering what he's dropped throughout his career.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it feels right to honor the emotional and vulnerable single, one that cemented Drizzy as a heartbreak king. Not everyone can turn the drunk-dial into high art, but somehow, this man has done exactly that. Pouring a surprising amount of depth into what might have been a sloppy affair, "Marvin's Room" is Drake at his most real, his most melancholic, his most self-aware. Torn between the trappings of fame and the soft call of intimate connection, Drizzy navigates both worlds with inebriated grace; has his songwriting prowess ever been more evident? You be the judge.</p>

      <p>I think I'm addicted to naked pictures<br/>And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had<br/>I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters<br/>Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad<br/>But, shit, it's all good<br/>We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party<br/>Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party<br/>I was just calling, â€˜cause they were just leavin'<br/>Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in</p>
