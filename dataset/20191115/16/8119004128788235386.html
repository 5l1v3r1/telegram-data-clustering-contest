        <b>Opener Mayank Agarwal smashed an epic 243 and forged two century-plus partnerships to flatten Bangladesh and put India firmly in control of the opening Test in Indore on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 28-year-old clobbered eight sixes and 28 fours in his career-best knock before holing out in the deep as India finished day two on a commanding 493-6 for an overall lead of 343 runs.</p>
      <p>Ravindra Jadeja, who made a breezy 60 not out, and Umesh Yadav (25 not out) will return on Saturday hoping to bat Bangladesh out of the contest at Indore's Holkar stadium.</p>
      <p>India plundered 407 runs on the second day, while Bangladesh were left to rue dropping Agarwal on 32 at slip on Thursday, when Imrul Kayes spilled a routine catch off Abu Jayed's bowling.</p>
      <p>Abu struck twice in the first 30 minutes after India resumed the day on 86-1.</p>
      <p>The right-arm quick sent back Cheteshwar Pujara, who made an uncharacteristically aggressive 54, and then trapped Virat Kohli lbw for a two-ball duck.</p>
      <p>Ajinkya Rahane walked in to join Agarwal and they milked the jaded Bangladesh attack with ridiculous ease during their 190-run partnership.</p>
      <p>Agarwal was adjudged lbw to Mehidy Hasan Miraz on 82 but challenged the decision which was overturned after replays suggested the ball would have missed the stumps.</p>
      <p>The nimble-footed opener flicked Ebadat Hossain to bring up his hundred but Rahane missed his century and fell for 86.</p>

      <p>As Agarwal cruised past the 150-mark, Kohli egged on the opener from the dressing room to push for a double century.</p>
      <p>Agarwal reached his second double hundred in style, hitting Mehidy over long-on for a massive six, and celebrated with raised arms looking skywards.</p>
      <p>Having lived up to his captain's expectation, Agarwal smiled back at Kohli, who flashed three fingers suggesting the opener should go for a triple hundred.</p>
      <p>That was not to be though as Agarwal's slog-sweep off Mehidy found Abu at deep midwicket. Agarwal added 123 runs with Jadeja.</p>
      <p>Abu claimed 4-108 but ended up as one of the four Bangladesh bowlers who bled 100-plus runs.</p>
      <p>"We had lost two wickets, so the idea was to be cautious, but not too cautious," Agarwal told broadcaster Star Sports of their batting approach.</p>
      <p>"Once we got a good partnership, it was all about building. I was watching the ball well, so thought 'why not' for the big shots. We haven't spoken about declaration, but we are in the driver's seat."</p>
      <p>It was always going to be a difficult tour for Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Captain Shakib Al Hasan was banned from all cricket for two years with one year of that suspended after the all-rounder was found to have breached the International Cricket Council's Anti-Corruption code.</p>
      <p>They are also without opener Tamim Iqbal, who has opted out of the tour to be with his pregnant wife, and all-rounder Mohammad Saifuddin, who is nursing a back injury.</p>
