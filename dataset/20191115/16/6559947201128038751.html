      <h3>Why Use a Meal-Kit Delivery Service?</h3>
      <p>Whether you're <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/internet-3/34976/a-terrible-cook-tries-blue-apron">a beginner in the kitchen</a> or don't have the time or inclination to plan and shop for meals, a meal-kit delivery service is one way to ensure you get several healthful, home-cooked meals per week for yourself and your household. The instructions are generally clear enough, and the recipes simple enough that preparing them won't eat up too much of your time, either. Furthermore, if the alternative is going out to eat or getting delivery from a restaurant, chances are good you might save some money, too. These services ship you recipes, cooking tips, and the exact amounts (most of the time) of the ingredients you need to create the meals. We've tested many of them, and we've found that quality is pretty stellar across the board, with clear instructions and mostly tasty results. Costs are pretty close across the board for these services. They differ in the breadth of choices, ingredient quality, recipe clarity, how well companies pack their boxes (yes, you'll care), and how much of the packaging is recyclable.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>A Growing Category</h3>
      <p>There are many reasons for meal delivery service popularity. There's the time-saving convenience, of courseâ€”once you've signed up and indicated your preferences, your box of potential meals arrives regularly: You just unpack and cook. Also part of the equation is a preference for a certain type of diet: Many of the services offer choices such as vegetarian, paleo, low-carb, and vegan, and some trumpet their healthful recipes and locally sourced, organic, and non-GMO food sources, for those who are concerned about such things. And some, like <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/graze/82670/review/graze-snack-delivery-service">Graze</a>, offer healthy snacks in individual portions. Subscribing to one of these plans can help you stick to your dietary resolutions.</p>
      <p>Then there are the kitchen newbies who want to cook for themselves and hope to learn basic (and even not-so-basic) culinary skills via meal kits. We've found that someâ€”particularly Blue Apronâ€”are better at teaching new skills than others, such as Home Chef.</p>
      <p>And finally, even if you're a seasoned chef, you might find yourself falling into recipe ruts. Meal-kit delivery services can introduce you to a whole new repertoire of menu possibilities.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>What Do Meal-Kit Delivery Services Have in Common?</h3>
      <p>With all the services we've tried, online enrollment is swift and easy, and their websites have extensive FAQs. You can nearly always find the information you need with a few obvious clicks. And generally, you can easily suspend or cancel the service with reasonable notice.</p>
      <p>Once your boxes start arriving, you need to have just a few ingredients and tools on hand. Typically you need cooking oil, salt and pepper, and maybe eggs, as well as basic cooking tools (pots and pans, kitchen knives, a grater, and so on). You may need a blender or food processor from time to time, but many companies offer an alternative process if you don't have one. Everything else is in the box. All the services reviewed here send large, colorful recipe cards that are nice enough to keep, though the recipes are published online, too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/515884-home-chef.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In our testing, all the meal-kit services were reliable in delivering fresh, high-quality ingredients with just a couple exceptions, which were addressed immediately and satisfactorily when we contacted customer service. In general, customer service is exemplary for most of these services.</p>
      <p>Prices do vary, but not by too much. You can expect to pay about $9 to $12 a meal, depending on which service and plan you choose. Bear in mind that you won't be tossing away unused ingredients, as you might be if you shopped for them yourself, which could save you a little cash. From time to time, you may have some ingredient leftovers such as garlic cloves or part of a shallot. Some plans offer extras: For example, Sun Basket and Home Chef send specialty cuts of meat for an extra charge, Blue Apron offers a separate wine-pairing service for its meals, and Plated and PeachDish each offer dessert.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/603953-meal-kits-pork-chops.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>How Are They Different?</h3>
      <p>One main difference is in the types of meals and breadth of choices the services offer. If you're looking for a particular way of eating, shop around, and you'll probably find it. Sun Basket, for example, has paleo, gluten-free, and vegetarian meal plans. It also sells cuts of meat, poultry, and seafood a la carte if some in the household eat vegetarian, for example. Purple Carrot is exclusively vegan. The services also vary in how much control you have over your weekly menu. Some offer loads of recipes you can pick from, others just a few.</p>
      <p>In testing, we found some services' meals to be tastier than others. Your palate may vary.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/515882-home-chef.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Something else that varies among services is the quality of instruction. Some recipes are super clearâ€”detailed and easy to follow. Others assume knowledge of ingredients and techniques that not everyone possesses. We especially appreciate that certain services, including HelloFresh and Blue Apron, have video tutorials onsite and in their apps.</p>
      <p>Then there's something you might not initially think aboutâ€”packaging. How well do companies pack their boxes, and how much of the packaging is recyclable? A well-packed box arrives with enough insulation and cooling packsâ€”and no room to shift aroundâ€”to ensure none of your food gets warm and icky. It's even better if some packaging comes from recycled materials. Still, you have acres of packing material to get rid of, and it's not always easily recyclable. For example, most of the ice packs that meal kit companies use are recyclable, but you have to cut them open and discard the icy filling, which is annoying and messy. We recommend doing it over a garbage can, preferably outside, if you can. The excess packaging can be a deal killer for those who care about the environment (and you should, dammit!). Our reviews specify the sustainability and recyclability of the packaging materials these companies use.</p>

      <h3>Choosing the Right Meal-Kit Delivery Service for You</h3>
      <p>First, consider the reason you want to join up with one of these services. Convenience is a given. If you want to learn more about cooking, some are better than others for that. If you're looking to add new cuisines and ingredients to your stockpile of culinary knowledge, make sure you pick a company that offers a wide range of menus. And for those who stick to a specific way of eating, you'll want to search out plans that offer it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/515851-plated.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You can suspend or cancel these plans at your discretion, allowing you to try a few different services before you settle on the right one for you. Some let you do this conveniently, right within your online account. Sun Basket requires an email or phone call to cancel, however.</p>
      <p>Here's a pro tip when you're settling on a plan: Check for <a href="https://www.offers.com/c/meal-delivery/">promo codes</a> before you order that first box. There's a lot of competition right now in this category, and you can frequently find discountsâ€”maybe even get an entire box for free. Also, make sure to check on how much notice you need to give to suspend or cancel the service, in case you travel frequently or are shopping around.</p>
      <p>We tested each meal kit service by placing at least two orders, evaluating the recipes on how easy they were to follow, and of course, how they tasted, and also considered plan variation, mobile apps, customer support, and how easy it is to cancel.</p>
      <p>If you're considering a meal delivery service for health reasons, you should also consider a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/fitness-trackers/159/the-best-fitness-trackers">fitness tracker</a> and a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/apps/42450/guide/the-25-best-fitness-apps-for-2016">fitness app</a> or two, too. Both can help you meet your fitness and health goals, whether it's tracking what and how much you eat or helping you burn off the delicious meals these services deliver.
