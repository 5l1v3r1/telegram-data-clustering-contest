      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - The Republican-dominated Ohio House has approved a bill expanding religious freedom in public schools and allow students to engage in religious expression in their school assignments.</p>
      <p>The measure was sent to the Senate Wednesday after a 61-31 vote.</p>
      <p>The bill would remove a current provision limiting expressions of religious beliefs by public school students to lunch and non-instructional periods and would allow them to gather as students do for secular activities.</p>
      <p>It also says schools can't prohibit students from religious expression in homework, artwork or other assignments and teachers cannot penalize or reward work based on its religious content.</p>
      <p>Republican sponsor Rep. Timothy Ginter told Cleveland.com work that should be graded using ordinary academic standards and assignments could still receive a lesser grade if they don't reflect what's being taught.</p>
