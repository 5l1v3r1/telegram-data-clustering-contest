      <p>A prisoner was sodomized with a broomstick by other inmates who then poured boiling water down his anus.</p>
      <p>Another was made to walk on all fours like a dog on a leash, with a third man gang-raped by inmates while another frightened prisoner lay in bed and listened.</p>
      <p>The horrific abuse took place in the Alabama prison system, and has been cataloged in a landmark investigation recently published by the <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/in-depth/news/2019/11/13/alabama-department-corrections-prison-inmates-describe-horrid-conditions/2234480001/">Montgomery Advertiser</a>.</p>
      <p>Many of them men who spoke to the paper did so anonymously via letters or phone calls paid for the paper, fearing they would face reprisals if named.</p>
      <p>Recalling his experiences, one inmate called T said: ‘There was a night where there was a guy screaming in the back of the dorm. They were taking turns raping him.’</p>

      <p>Jacob, who was recently released from prison said: ‘A guard looks right at me and says, “You’re going to be somebody’s boy in here,” like their girlfriend or property, and laughed…</p>
      <p>‘A couple of guys took me under their wing, and I moved over to be by them.</p>
      <p>‘Slowly but surely, little things happened: They try to come on to you, offer you things.</p>
      <p>‘But I wasn’t trying to fall for that. One man asked me to perform oral sex on him. He got really graphic, he told me he was safe, he was clean.</p>

      <p>‘He told me I could do it one time, and he’d leave me alone, or he could beat me up and take it every day.’</p>
      <p>Multiple prisoners said Alabama’s prisons are filled with knives, with inmates creating makeshift weapons from parts of their beds, or hinges from chests of drawers.</p>
      <p>They blame the crisis on extreme overcrowding, with the state’s prisons running at 165% capacity.</p>
      <p>Short-staffing, guard-apathy and a huge influx of drugs have also exacerbated the crisis.</p>
      <p>Inmates are forced to sleep in huge dorms filled with bunk beds. But the facilities are so overcrowded some men are ‘homeless’ even within jail, and forced to sleep on floors instead.</p>
      <p>Roberts spoke of extreme short-staffing, saying there were just 11 guards to keep watch on thousands of inmates one evening.</p>

      <p>Another inmate named only as S spoke of horrific hygiene conditions, saying: ‘You go to the kitchen, it smells like raw sewage.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes you see water on the floor from where sewage runs over.’</p>
      <p>The Montgomery Advertiser began its investigation in the wake of a Department of Justice report published May that condemned conditions in Alabama’s prisons.</p>
      <p>They said the state’s prison system was violating inmates’ constitutional rights.</p>
      <p>The report added that ‘The violations are severe, systemic, and exacerbated by serious deficiencies in staffing and supervision.’</p>
      <p>Alabama Governor Kay Ivey has acknowledged the report, and says the problems will now be tackled by state officials.</p>
      <p>But inmates say the problem is too widespread, and that federal assistance is needed.</p>
      <p>One whistleblower said: ‘If I die in here, I don’t want it to be a waste.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe what I’m saying will save somebody.’</p>
      <p>Another man who agreed to be named, Wendell Roberts, said: ‘American Horror Story has nothing on this place.’</p>
      <p>A third said he understood many people would struggle to sympathise with criminals, but added: ‘Maybe someday you have a family member that comes here.</p>
      <p>‘Even though we committed crimes, and we’re in here doing our time —  I won’t deny my crime — we’re still human.</p>
      <p>‘It’s gotten to the point we’re not treated like humans.’</p>
