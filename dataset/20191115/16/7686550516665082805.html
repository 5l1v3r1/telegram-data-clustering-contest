      <h1>Unusual shopping habits of suspects in burglary spree detailed to Swansea Crown Court</h1>
      <h2>Who buys hats and scarves on hot days in August?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:35:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Evans</a></address>
      <p>A member of an alleged gang of burglars bought hats and scarves from a supermarket on a hot summer's day, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>He also bought a pair store own-brand trainers and footwear marks from that type of shoe were subsequently found at the scenes of a number break-ins.</p>
      <p>The purchases were revealed at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-crown-court">Swansea Crown Court</a> during a trial of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/swansea-crown-court-burglary-case-17237983">10 people accused of conspiring together to carry out scores of burglaries</a> across south west Wales.</p>
      <p>Over the course of almost six months houses from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/llanelli">Llanelli</a> to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/porthcawl">Porthcawl</a> were raided, with tens of thousands of pounds worth of jewellery and large sums of cash stolen.</p>
      <p>On Thursday the jury heard about footwear marks that were found at a number of burglaries committed in October 2018 - they were later identified as having been made by Asda 600-make trainers.</p>
      <p>Investigators than began tracing purchases of similar shoes in the area over recent months.</p>
      <p>The court heard police found that on August 6 the youth who cannot be named was caught on CCTV shopping at the Asda store on Swansea Enterprise Zone in the company of a man called Michael Casey, and a male who had never been identified.</p>
      <p>Two pairs of Asda-600 training shoes in sizes eight and nine were purchased, along with hats and scarves.</p>
      <p>The trio then left the shop together in an Irish-registered Ford Focus car.</p>
      <p>The court heard police went back and checked the temperature in Swansea on the day in question, and that it was between 20C and 22C.</p>
      <p>The court has previously heard how scores of burglaries were committed between July 2018 and January 2019.</p>
      <p>Almost all the raids followed a similar pattern - stolen cars on false number plates would be used to get to and from the houses; one male would remain in the vehicles acting as a lookout and getaway driver; a group of three of four masked or hooded accomplices would them smash their way into the properties and ransack them looking almost exclusively for gold jewellery and cash.</p>
      <p>In some of the burglaries bleach or other cleaning products were used to try to mask or destroy forensic evidence.</p>
      <p>It is the Crown's case that all the accused - to a greater of lesser extent - were involved in the conspiracy.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that Christine Joyce, aged 59, of Mill Stream Way travellers site, Swansea Vale, Daniel Joseph Joyce aged 35, of Mill Stream Way travellers site, Swansea Vale, James Daniel Joyce, aged 39, of Llangyfelach Road, Brynhyfryd, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a>, Keiran Joseph Joyce, aged 59, of Mill Stream Way travellers site, Swansea Vale, Kieran Joyce, aged 27, of Mynells Gorse travellers site, Golf Course Lane, Leicester, Terrence Casey, aged 20, of Mynells Gorse travellers site, Leicester, Mary Kate Connors, aged 23, of Rhossilliy Avenue, Rumney, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff</a>, William Edward Joyce, aged 24, of HMP Swansea, 21-year-old Patrick Joyce, of HMP Onley in Rugby, and a youth who cannot be named because of his age, were all part of a conspiracy to carry out the burglaries.</p>
      <p>Patrick Joyce, Daniel Joyce, James Joyce, and Keiran Joyce are also charged with one count of aggravated burglary.</p>
      <p>All the defendants deny all the charges against them, and the trial continues.</p>
