      <p>Yoga guru Baba Ramdev interspersed his talk at the conference with a demonstration of various asanas and underlined their health benefits for the heart, management of hypertension and diabetes.</p>
      <p>“Yoga can play a role in establishing a disease-free and violence-free society as it raises the fitness levels and infuses positive thoughts,” he claimed at the conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>Performing ‘kapalabhati’, a breathing technique, at KSOU Convocation Hall, Mr. Ramdev said the exercises cleanse the body. “I am 50 years old. Look at my energy level. I can challenge a 25-year-old for a wrestling bout. I got this strength from yoga,” he said, recommending adoption of yoga in daily life. “With diseases striking at younger ages with changes in lifestyles and other factors, yoga will go a long way in keeping the body fit,” he maintained.</p>
