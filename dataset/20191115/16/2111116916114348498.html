      <p>In today’s interconnected world, the foreign exchange market plays an important role in daily business. It’s a global, decentralized environment where financial institutions and businesses can trade currencies.</p>
      <p>According to research from the Bank for International Settlements, foreign exchange trading generates an estimated $5.3 trillion daily - making it larger than other financial markets. Often, it’s dominated by large international banks and corporations, which work around the clock to trade and convert international currencies.   </p>
      <p>Forex trading also underpins international trade and investments. For instance, if American companies want to import goods from a country in Europe, they’ll most likely need to complete transactions in euros. Through forex, these firms can exchange dollars for euros quickly and easily. </p>
      <p>As well as enabling trade between countries, forex trading is a lucrative investment opportunity. Every day, companies and investors make billions by purchasing and trading currencies. However, it does take a significant amount of experience and skills to make lucrative forex trades.</p>
      <p>That’s where forex trading software comes into the picture, automating this common business practice. Essentially, it ploughs through the market for the best currency trading opportunities. And in this article, we’ve picked out the best forex trading apps around.</p>

      <h4>5. TD Ameritrade</h4>
      <p>One of America's biggest trading platforms</p>
      <aside>TD Ameritrade$6.95Visit Siteat TD Ameritrade</aside>
      <p>+ Good educational materials<br/>+ Wide range of investment products<br/>+ Good for beginners<br/>- Can be cumbersome for Forex only</p>
      <p>TD Ameritrade is one of America's biggest and more established trading platforms, and offers a wide range of investment vehicles for trading, not just forex. </p>
      <p>However, where it really excels is through its focus on trying to educate forex traders to help reduce the chances of them losing money. It does this through its thinkorswim platform, which provides introductory materials from the </p>
      <p>National Futures Association, which regulate futures brokers. The information is presented in a clear and easy-to-read way, and it really does underline the risks that need to be considered.</p>
      <p>So if you're new to currency trading, you could feel better prepared and eased into managing not just trades but risk with more confidence, rather than rushing into dangerous leverages that can lose you money fast.</p>
      <p>But while that's a big plus for TD Ameritrade, it is a wide platform that covers a comprehensive range of trading products, not least stocks, futures, and options. So if you're looking to focus only on forex you may find the platform sometimes clunky by comparison to dedicated forex trading platforms, especially when it comes to comparing currency pairs. </p>
      <p>Even still, the introductory and supporting materials are worth getting to grips with, and if you want to get involved with more than currency trading you're in an ideal place to expand your investment strategy into other products.</p>
