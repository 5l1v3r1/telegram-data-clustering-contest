      <p><i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> began in 2013 and stars Andy Samberg, Andre Braugher, Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, Joe Lo Truglio, Dirk Blocker and Joel McKinnon Miller.</p>
      <p>The show was named <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/nme-tv-of-the-year-2018-2416881">one of <i>NME</i>‘s favourite TV shows of 2018</a>. Writing about its success, Hannah Mylrea said: “Earlier this year, Fox announced this US cop-comedy was to be axed. And the fans did not like it one bit. After a day of campaigning on social media, NBC picked up the show for a sixth season, which is good, as this year’s fifth was the one where it really hit its stride.</p>
      <p>“While still as warm and funny as before, fans finally got the moments they were waiting for (Jake and Amy’s wedding, Holt running to be police commissioner) and Rosa’s (Stephanie Beatriz) coming out story, which boasted some of the most heartwarming and emotive moments of the series so far.”</p>
      <p>Season 7 of <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> airs on February 6, 2020.</p>
