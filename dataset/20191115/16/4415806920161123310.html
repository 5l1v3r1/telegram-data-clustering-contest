      <h1>Please reach out to elderly and isolated this Christmas says Irish author Marian Keyes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:37:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/evelyn-ring/" target="_blank">By Evelyn Ring</a></address>
      <p>There can only be “an upside” from reaching out and spending some time with older people who may feel lonely or isolated this Christmas, says successful Irish author, Marian Keyes.</p>
      <p>Marian is backing Alone's Christmas campaign to encourage people to “make their minutes count” by working together to tackle loneliness and isolation.</p>
      <p>The organisation that supports older people to age at home was delighted when Marian, who writes a lot about the challenges people face in their lives, agreed to be their ambassador.</p>
      <p>Marian said she had been a friend of Alone for a long time because the loneliness that some older people experienced “resonated” with her.</p>
      <p>“There can only be an upside from checking in on older people, especially at this time of year,” the author said at the launch of the Christmas campaign.</p>
      <p>“As we age, it can be more difficult to reach out to people for companionship; a lot of older people might be embarrassed or too proud to admit that they are lonely.</p>
      <p>“What might only seem like a quick chat to you can make an older person feel loved, appreciated, and that they are part of the community.</p>

      <p>“Older people have the most amazing stories to tell and it’s really important that we take the time to listen.“</p>
      <p>Marian thought Christmas was “very much a mixed bag of frogs” because of pressure on people who are expected to be happy and spend time with their families.</p>
      <p>“But if you are alone and you see images of happy families everywhere it is brutally painful,” she said.</p>
      <p>She hoped that some people would also consider being a volunteer for Alone as one of their New Year's resolutions – it would only take an hour out of their week to visit somebody.</p>

      <p>“It would be a wonderful thing to do for everyone involved, not just the person who is living alone and getting a much needed, much anticipated and much-appreciated visit.</p>
      <p>“Just because a person is 20 or 40 years older than us does not make them any less funny, entertaining or interesting – they are still the people they always were.</p>
      <blockquote>"Everyone one of us will be old one day and just showing a little bit more empathy might really help everybody involved.”</blockquote>
      <p>Alone chief executive, Seán Moynihan, said the organisation had around 2,000 volunteers who are all trained and garda vetted and wanted to increase the number to 9,000.</p>
      <p>“As we recruit and train more volunteers we also have more older people reaching out for our services,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Moynihan said there had been a five-fold increase in the demand for their services over the last three years.</p>
      <p>Alone depends on the generosity of the public for support through volunteering and donations. It receives around 25% of its funding from the State.</p>
      <p>The Alone national phone line – 0818 222024, is open weekdays from 9am to 5pm.</p>
