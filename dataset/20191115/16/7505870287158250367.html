      <h1>Scorsese’s Marvel-bashing might hurt ‘The Irishman’ in a way he never anticipated</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:14:05+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:14</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Smith</a></address>
      <p>Years in the making, <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/09/28/new-trailers-the-irishman-el-camino-frozen-ii-uncut-gems-others/"><i>The Irishman</i></a> is surely going to be a great mobster movie, featuring a fabulous cast and a director who made a name for himself with this very genre. It’s also a film that targets Oscar season, which is why it saw a limited theatrical release a few days ago. Theaters, however, aren’t pleased with the fact that Martin Scorsese’s latest movie is made by Netflix, so the film had a hard time getting deals with cinema chains. Maybe that’s why Scorsese said what he said about Marvel movies, doubling down on the idea that <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/05/martin-scorsese-marvel-superhero-films-still-not-cinema-director-says/">superhero films aren’t cinema</a> just a few days ago. As it turns out, Scorsese’s comments might end up hurting him and his new movie in a way he never could have anticipated.</p>
      <p>An unnamed Academy member <a href="https://variety.com/2019/voices/columns/martin-scorsese-marvel-irishman-oscar-1203404301/">remarked “what a snob!” to <i>Variety</i></a> when asked about Scorsese’s <i>The New York Times</i> Op-Ed, in which he defended his initial stance on Marvel movies. While it’s too early to say whether <i>The Irishman</i> will get any nominations, <i>Variety</i> says that Scorsese’s comments may have really hurt the film’s chances of scoring big at the Oscars.</p>
      <p>“I have been to a lot of Academy screenings this year, and I have never seen anything as crowded as ‘Endgame,’” said an Academy member.</p>
      <p>The report notes that the Academy has increasingly younger members who are the kind of voters that may be partial to Marvel movies, and who may have helped <i>Black Panther</i> become the first Marvel film to score a best picture nomination.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t help <i>The Irishman</i> that it’s first and foremost a Netflix film, and Netflix has been struggling to get into the Oscars, at least until last year’s <i>Roma</i>. In fact, some people think that Netflix films aren’t worthy of Academy Awards, with Steven Spielberg being a prominent voice who took a stance against Netflix not too long ago.</p>
      <p>It’s certainly possible that <i>The Irishman</i> will still get the attention it likely deserves, as well as Oscar nominations. <i>Variety</i> notes that one awards consultant thinks <i>The Irishman</i> still has a chance at the Oscars in spite of Scorsese’s shots at Marvel. But Scorsese might have just made everything a lot more complicated than it should have been.</p>
      <p><i>The Irishman</i> premieres on Netflix on November 27th.</p>
