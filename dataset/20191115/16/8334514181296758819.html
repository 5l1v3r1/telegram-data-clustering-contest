      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - An outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo should be eradicated by the end of 2019, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The epidemic in Congo was declared in August 2018 and has so far killed nearly 2,200 people, making it the second-worst outbreak of the virus on record behind the 2013-16 West African outbreak that killed more than 11,300.</p>
      <p>The rate of new cases has fallen substantially in recent weeks, according to government data.</p>
      <p>“There are still a few isolated cases in Ituri (province) but we think that by the end of the year we can completely stop that,” Tshisekedi said at a news conference in Berlin alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>
      <p>New vaccines and treatments have helped contain the outbreak, but public mistrust and armed conflict in eastern Congo have hampered the response.</p>
