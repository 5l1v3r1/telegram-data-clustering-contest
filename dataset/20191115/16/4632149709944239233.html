      <h1>Mane Marattakide movie review: This Sadhu Kokila multi-starrer film is to be taken lightly, without pondering over logic or content</h1>

      <p>One more horror-comedy and one more import. Mane Marattakide (house for sale) makes no bones about what it is about. So does it work? The first half takes its time to settle down and the rest of the film is a laugh riot. This is a film to be taken lightly, without pondering over logic or content. This is just for laughs and there are plenty of goofy, daffy and scary guffaws. <br/><br/>A NRI is unable to dispose his house in India as it is haunted. He is desperate to get rid of it. And there are three people who are more desperate to risk staying in it just to prove it is not haunted. The house is of course haunted, the poor souls waiting to discover their own stories and ready to unleash some fun. Most of the current lot of popular comedians of Sandalwood find something to do in this film. <br/><br/>If you have enjoyed the channel that constantly runs clips of Kannada film comedy, this is the film for you. The channel can run this end to end. All the actors have done their goofiest best, one better than the other. Sadhu, Chikkanna, Prataph have unleashed themselves like there was no next time. <br/><br/>Mane Marattakide is the remake of the Telugu film Anando Brahma. There was no need for any substantial deviations and none is offered. The songs could have been better and not strictly entertaining. As most of the film is shot on a single location, the cinematography had to be clear-cut and it is. The editing does not make any mistakes which could have derailed whatever logic the narration intends. This is the perfect time pass movie right now. Just don't buy the house.</p>
