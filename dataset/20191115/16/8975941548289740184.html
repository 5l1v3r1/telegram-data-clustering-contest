      <h1>Where the Fed’s Clarida is wrong — low unemployment has boosted wages</h1>
      <h2>Wage rises are not feeing through into inflation </h2>

      <p>In a speech to the Cato Institute this week, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida made the point that the decline in the unemployment rate hasn’t translated into wage growth.</p>
      <p>“Another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less responsive to resource slack,” said Clarida. “That is, the short-run price Phillips curve—if not the wage Phillips curve—appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.”</p>
      <p>Economists at RBC Capital Markets say that is just not the case.</p>

      <p>“Quite clearly, and as the chart below highlights, as the unemployment rate slipped below the ‘neutral’ estimate of 4.6% (we use the CBO guesstimate), average hourly earnings accelerated,” they said in a note to clients.</p>
      <p>In October, the unemployment rate was 3.6%, while average hourly earnings for production workers was 3.5%.</p>
      <p>Still, the RBC economists get to the same place as Clarida.</p>
      <p>“So it is not that tight labor markets are not generating wage growth, rather that wage growth is not feeding through to general inflation. That is not a bad thing!”</p>
      <p>Clarida made a similar point. “Although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages are putting excessive upward pressure on price inflation,” he said.</p>
      <p>That lack of consumer price inflation is why the Fed was comfortable making three straight interest-rate cuts.</p>
