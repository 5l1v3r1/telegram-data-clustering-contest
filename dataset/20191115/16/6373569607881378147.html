      <p>A senior leader at a troubled Plymouth school has been suspended amid 'bullying and mismanagement' claims.</p>
      <p>Chris Humphries, director of performance at <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/real-story-behind-troubled-plymouth-2996284">ACE Schools Multi Academy Trust</a>, which is based at Martins Gate, <a href="http://www.plymouthlive.com/all-about/bretonside">Bretonside</a>, was suspended earlier this week and an investigation is underway.</p>
      <p>In an email, seen by Plymouth Live, staff at ACE were informed of Mr Humphries' suspension and asked to send "submissions with respect to bullying and mismanagement" to the board of governors.</p>
      <p>A source, who wished to remain anonymous, told Plymouth Live that there 'were a number of issues surrounding senior leaders' at the trust.</p>
      <p>Ace Schools confirmed that it had a "formal process running currently" and it was "not in a position to comment" at this time.</p>
      <p>It comes after Sarah Gillet, CEO of ACE MAT <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/head-leaves-troubled-plymouth-school-3086226">was suspended and left with immediate effect</a> in July this year.</p>
      <p>School staff have previously said that they feel "mistreated" and <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/mistreated-staff-troubled-plymouth-school-3024058">have gone out on strike to voice their concerns</a> with staff treatment.</p>
      <p>Mr Humphries' profile on the trust website states: "I worked for fourteen years running Outdoor Education Centres around the UK before retraining as a geography teacher and combining my outdoor education qualifications with teaching. </p>
      <p>"I have led an outstanding pupil referral unit, been shortlisted for a TES Leadership award, hold an NPQH qualification and also am currently a specialist leader in education for behaviour and leadership. </p>
      <p>"My core values are based on helping make a difference not just to our students but also to our staff and partners.  I am currently undertaking a masters in coaching and mentoring to help embed a coaching philosophy across our organisation and through the training we offer other organisations. </p>
      <p>"Much of my personal time is devoted to my love of sailing which has been a lifelong passion."</p>
      <p>The trust specialises in providing for children of both primary and secondary school age who have needs outside mainstream education and operates from a number of locations around Plymouth as well as satellite bases in Devon and Cornwall.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Courtlands Special School joined the trust.</p>
