      <h1>Marie Yovanovitch Denies Ukraine Meddled in 2016 Election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:32:04+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author">Charlie Spiering</a></address>
      <p>Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch denied that Ukraine had meddled in United States elections, although she admitted there were “rumors” of it happening.</p>
      <p>“There have been rumors out there about things like that but there was nothing hard, nothing I was aware of,” she replied, when asked by the Democrat counsel Daniel Goldman if Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>“There was nothing based in fact to support these allegations,” Goldman stated.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” she agreed.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/ukraine-sabotage-trump-backfire-233446">public</a> media <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/did-ukraine-try-to-interfere-in-the-2016-election/">reports</a> do have hard evidence of Ukranian officials working with Democrat operatives during the 2016 election. Politico reported, as fact, Ukraine tried to <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/ukraine-sabotage-trump-backfire-233446">“sabotage” </a>Trump in 2016.</p>
      <p>Veteran Democratic operative Alexandra Chalupa, who worked in the Clinton White House, reached out to Ukrainian officials to get damaging information about Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort during the 2016 election. Manafort was a political adviser to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
      <p>Chalupa <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/ukraine-sabotage-trump-backfire-233446">worked</a> with officials in the Ukranian <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/did-ukraine-try-to-interfere-in-the-2016-election/">embassy</a> in Washington and with officials in Kyiv.</p>
      <p>Trump’s supporters argue that reports of Ukrainian meddling in the election gave the president understandable concern about Ukrainian relations, which is why he wanted any kind of activity was investigated before giving them military aid.</p>
