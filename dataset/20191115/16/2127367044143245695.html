      <h2>T10 League: Yuvraj Singh could only score six runs off six balls, while Andre Russell smashed 58 runs off just 24 balls.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:20:06+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author">Indo-Asian News Service</a></address>
      <p>Six balls, six runs including a boundary -- that's how the debut T10 innings of <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/sania-mirza-birthday-tennis-stars-reply-to-yuvraj-singhs-wish-is-comedy-gold-2133012">Yuvraj Singh</a> panned out at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Friday. Playing for <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/yuvraj-singh-signed-by-maratha-arabians-as-icon-player-in-t10-league-2121995">Maratha Arabians</a> in the inaugural match of the third edition of the Abu Dhabi T10, Yuvraj came out to bat at No. 4 after Chris Lynn got out against Northern Warriors. However, hundreds of fans who had turned up to see the stylish left-hander hit the ball out of the park couldn't get enough from the Indian southpaw as he failed to impress.</p>
      <p>The marquee player from India started off in great fashion as he collected a boundary courtesy a leg-glance off the bowling of another big-hitting West Indies all-rounder <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/andre-russell-announces-arrival-of-first-baby-reveals-gender-in-style-watch-2102553">Andre Russell</a>.</p>
      <p>The next four deliveries for the retired Indian all-rounder yielded two runs before he got out on the sixth ball while trying to go for a lofted shot over long-on off Rayad Emrit and was eventually caught by Chris Green just past the inner circle.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old, who retired from international cricket earlier this year, didn't get a chance to bowl as Warriors chased down the target of 89 with the utmost ease.</p>
      <p>Russell was once again at his menacing best as he smashed 58 runs off just 24 balls and led the Warriors to a comprehensive eight-wicket win. He also contributed with the ball, picking up two wickets in his two overs.</p>
      <p>Yuvraj played starring roles for India in their title winning squads at the 2007 World T20 and the 2011 ODI World Cup. His exploits at the two events made a big splash across the globe, including his six sixes in an over in 2007 and the all-round exploits at the 2011 World Cup.</p>
