      <p>We've just spotted what could be the best early <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday deal</a> so far; the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/hands-on-sony-wh-1000xm3-wireless-headphones-review">Sony WH-1000XM3 Wireless Headphones</a> have been given a whopping £92 discount over at eBay, bringing the price down from £300 to just £208. That's the lowest price we've ever seen. </p>
      <p>They're the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/audio/portable-audio/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-1280490">best noise-cancelling headphones</a> we've tested, as well as the top <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/audio/portable-audio/best-headphones-1280340">headphones</a> of 2019 overall, thanks to their fantastic sound quality and brilliant 30-hour battery life. </p>

      <p>Support for <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/hi-res-audio-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-lossless-music-codec">Hi-Res Audio</a> codecs means that audiophiles can hear every detail in their favorite songs, while Sony's unmatched noise cancellation makes the WH-1000XM3 perfect for commuters (or anyone who wants a bit of peace and quiet). </p>
      <p>They don't just sound good either – they look good too, with a minimalist design that oozes sophistication. </p>
      <p>A dedicated voice assistant button also means that you can summon <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/how-to/google-assistant-how-to-make-your-google-home-speaker-work-for-you">Google Assistant</a> hands free.

      <h4>Let the deals war begin</h4>
      <p>While it's harder to verify the legitimacy of eBay sellers than trusted retailers like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/john-lewis-black-friday-deals-15-11">John Lewis</a>, reviews for seller dwi-digital-cameras are very positive, with a positive feedback rate of 95.9%. </p>
      <p>As far as we can tell, the company operates from Hong Kong, so shipping may take a little longer than the advertised eight business days and you're always advised to be more wary of goods shipping from overseas compared to the UK.</p>
      <p>Need your Sony WH-1000XM3 quicker? Amazon is currently selling them with a £32 discount, bringing the price to £269 – and they're eligible for next-day delivery. That's  more expensive than the previous lowest price we saw for these cans; they dropped to £242.99 at Amazon <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/sony-wh-1000xm3-are-at-their-lowest-price-ever-in-amazon-black-friday-deal">on November 11</a>, and chances are that they'll drop again over the Black Friday / Cyber Monday period.</p>
