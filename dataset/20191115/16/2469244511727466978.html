      <h1>Anger over Devon and Cornwall crime commissioner 'using public position' to support political friends</h1>
      <h2>"This is further disgraceful conduct by the Devon and Cornwall PCC" - Ben Bradshaw</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:24:29+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Greaves</a></address>
      <p>Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has blasted crime commissioner Alison Hernandez for using social media to endorse Conservative candidates in the election.</p>
      <p>Ms Hernandez is accused of using her personal Twitter account to support Tory hopefuls across the county - including John Gray who is standing as a rival for Mr Bradshaw's Exeter parliamentary seat.</p>
      <p>Mr Bradshaw has denounced the crime commissioner for as acting as a 'cheerleader' for the Conservatives in breach of her role in public office.</p>
      <p>Claire Wright, the independent Parliamentary candidate for East Devon, has also accused Ms Hernandez of abusing her position as crime commissioner to influence the election.</p>
      <p>Both have said she should be reported to the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners.</p>
      <p>But Ms Hernandez says she is not worried by the criticism and will continue to lend her personal support to Conservatives at the election while separately working cross party for safer streets in her role as PCC.</p>
      <p>The politicians' fury is directed at a number of tweets by Ms Hernandez's on her personal account since the General Election was called on November 9.</p>

      <p>Among the tweets are endorsements of Selaine Saxby and Simon Jupp, Conservative candidates in North and East Devon respectively.</p>
      <p>On Thursday she retweeted an Exeter Conservatives post showing her outside the new police HQ building in Middlemoor with Exeter Tory candidate John Gray.</p>

      <p>Mr Bradshaw said: "This is further disgraceful conduct by the Devon and Cornwall Crime Commissioner following on from her behaviour at the time of the Royal Clarence fire when she filmed or photographed herself completely inappropriately in front of this devastating event in Exeter.</p>

      <p>"Ms Hernandez should remember she holds an important public position and is not in charge of the police and she is not a political hack which is how she all too regularly appears.</p>
      <p>"I suspect this behaviour will just serve to undermine the campaign of the Tory candidates she is being a cheerleader for.</p>
      <p>"I will refer her behaviour to the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners as clearly it is in breach of guidance."</p>

      <p>According to the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners there is nothing that prevents those in the role from acting in a party political capacity as a private individual.</p>
      <p>But the guidance states: "They should not use their public office as a PCC to support party political candidates, or seek to influence the outcome of the election in a party political way."</p>

      <p>It says the PCC should 'act with integrity and objectivity' and should 'avoid placing themselves in difficult positions that might lead to perceptions of conflict of interest or lack of impartiality in the performance of their official duties'.</p>
      <p>Claire Wright, Independent parliamentary candidate for East Devon, said: “As I understand it, police and crime commissioners should not use their public office to endorse party political candidates or seek to influence the outcome of elections.</p>
      <p>Ms Hernandez's bio clearly states it is her personal twitter account, that she is the Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall and a Conservative.</p>
      <p>“Ms Hernandez has been endorsing, among others, my rival Conservative candidate from a Twitter account which is described as personal yet clearly shows her official title, has the official web address and contains a picture of her, apparently on official duty, with police officers and Boris Johnson," said Ms Wright.</p>
      <p>“I noticed that she had endorsed a candidate for the Exeter seat outside police HQ, which is actually in the East Exeter part of the East Devon constituency close to where I have been canvassing this week.</p>

      <p>“If the test is to distinguish between public and private activities, then I would say using this social media account to push local Tories during a general election fails that test.</p>
      <p>“I think it is right and proper to refer this behaviour to the relevant authorities.</p>
      <p>“It is inappropriate to use her position in this way and I hope she stops using what is a powerful and important regional role to try to influence an important election.”</p>
      <p>Ms Hernandez denies she has overstepped the line between her public and private roles.</p>
      <p>Referring to the tweet with Mr Gray outside the new Middlemoor HQ, where police will be based in 2020, she said: "If Ben Bradshaw wanted to speak to me about my police site I would not turn him down down or indeed any other candidate. The fact he has not approached me is not my issue.</p>
      <p>"Mr Bradshaw did not support my summer policing bid at the Home Office for a special grant, even though I had cross party support including from Luke Pollard [Labour MP for Plymouth]. Ben couldn't find the time.</p>
      <p>"This is a personal account and I have not used any office resorces to promote any political party. I've been putting information out personally as a Conservative.</p>
      <p>"I'm delighted Claire Wright recognises the important and powerful role I have. The police new police station will serve the Exeter community and the East Devon constituency.</p>
      <p>"I am a party member and a Conservative. I work across party and across the whole of Devon and Cornwall. The fact is Ben Bradshaw has never engaged is not my issue."</p>
