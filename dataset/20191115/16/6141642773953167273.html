      <p>Alex Albon crashed out after posting the fastest time of Friday’s rain-hit opening practice session in Brazil.</p>
      <p>The London-born Thai, who earlier this week was confirmed as a Red Bull driver for 2020, lost control of his car after switching to slick tyres.</p>
      <p>Lewis Hamilton, the newly-crowned six-time world champion, finished bottom after opting against posting a time in the tricky conditions.</p>

      <p>Albon had just soared to the top of the order when he slid off the track and into the barriers ahead of the uphill climb to the start-finish line.</p>
      <p>The Red Bull driver made significant impact with the barriers and sustained serious damage to the right-hand side of his car.</p>
      <p>Albon swore in frustration over the radio, but emerged unscathed from the accident which brought a premature end to the first action of the weekend here in Interlagos.</p>

      <p>Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, unperturbed by the poor conditions, was the first driver to hit the track.</p>
      <p>As the persistent rain relented, the circuit began to dry out, with Albon heading Mercedes’ Valtteri Bottas by half-a-second before his accident in the closing minutes.</p>
      <p>Vettel finished third, nine tenths off the pace, with Charles Leclerc – who will serve a 10-place grid penalty on Sunday following a change of engine parts – fourth in the sister Ferrari.</p>
      <p>Albon’s team-mate Max Verstappen, also spun while running on dry rubber in the latter stages, but the Dutchman escaped without damage.</p>

      <p>Hamilton, fresh from winning his sixth world championship in Texas a fortnight ago, spent most of the session watching on from the back of the Mercedes garage.</p>
      <p>He emerged on slicks in the final moments, but returned to the pits when the session was suspended in the wake of Albon’s accident.</p>
      <p>The concluding running of the day gets under way at 3pm local time (6pm UK) where conditions are expected to have improved.</p>
