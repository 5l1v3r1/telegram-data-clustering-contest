      <p>Hothead to hothead: “Things happen.”</p>
      <p>Cleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. supported teammate Myles Garrett after the defensive end incited a wild fight during Thursday night’s Browns-Steelers game.</p>
      <p>With eight seconds remaining, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/">Garrett ripped Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph’s helmet off</a> and used it to strike Rudolph in the head. Garrett was ejected as a result, along with Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi and Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what was said. I don’t know what was said all game,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILTSodsWj9w&amp;feature=youtu.be">Beckham said in the locker room, according to Cleveland.com</a>. “I didn’t even see what happened. I’ve seen the replays and all that. I just wouldn’t expect it from Myles, but things happen, man. Not to try and downplay it, but you just gotta keep pushing, be there for your brother and keep go on with the season.”</p>
      <p>Beckham, 27, who began his career with the Giants, is known as one of the more emotional players in the league and has a reputation for impassioned displays.</p>
      <p>Beckham has a long-standing feud with cornerback Josh Norman, which began <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/12/20/giants-furious-rally-falls-crushingly-short-after-beckham-loses-mind/">during an emotionally charged game in 2015 against the Panthers.</a> The then-Giants receiver was flagged for three personal fouls, compared to Norman’s two, and delivered a dangerous helmet-to-helmet hit. Earlier this season, Ravens cornerback <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/01/ravens-video-proves-marlon-humphrey-didnt-choke-odell-beckham/">Marlon Humphrey choked Beckham</a>, which resulted in both players throwing punches.</p>
      <p>“It’s an emotional game, and I understand all that. I understand the rivalry and emotions run high and all that,” Beckham said. “Obviously we’ve seen stuff in the past — players fighting and stuff like that…it’s unfortunate, and as much as I wanna be like, ‘It’s life,’ you know, things do happen. Bad things happen in this world.”</p>
      <p>Garrett, 23, was fined earlier this year for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/17/trevor-siemian-out-for-the-season-as-jets-qb-issues-somehow-get-worse/">a hit on Jets quarterback Trevor Siemian</a> that resulted in a gruesome ankle injury. He faces suspension after Thursday’s incident <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/nfl-must-make-an-example-out-of-myles-garrett/">that could span the remainder of the season or beyond.</a></p>
      <p>“You know it’s going to be talked about for weeks, all season,” Beckham said. “It’s going to be talked about for him going into the next season, and I know. I’m used to it. I’m happy to see the team can stick together and have Myles’ back. … When he does come back, we need 10 sacks a game.”</p>
