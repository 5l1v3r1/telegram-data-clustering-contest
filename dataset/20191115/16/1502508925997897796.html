      <p>Telecom operator Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) on Friday posted a loss of Rs 2,335 crore on account of provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.</p>
      <p>The company had recorded a loss of Rs 383.06 crore in the same period a year ago.</p>
      <p>Tata Teleservices ( Maharashtra) Limited (TTML) made provision of Rs 2,151 crore following the Supreme Court order on calculation of annual adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of telecom <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies.</a></p>
      <p>The apex court last month upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses in calculating the annual AGR, a share of which has to be paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.</p>
      <p>The revenue of TTML declined by about 16 per cent to Rs 270.35 crore during the reported quarter from Rs 321.84 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Though the company has demerged its consumer mobile business, the Department of Telecom has not taken the same on record.</p>
      <p>"The Company understands that DoT has filed Special leave Petitions against BAL (Bharti Airtel) in Hon'ble Supreme Court challenging interim orders of TDSAT," TTML said in a note.</p>
      <p>Shares of TTML closed at Rs 2.71 a unit, down by 3.56 per cent compared to previous close, at the BSE on Friday.</p>
