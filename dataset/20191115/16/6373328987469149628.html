        <b>If you’re sat there thinking, ‘you know what, I haven’t seen much of Noel Fielding’s weird and wonderful ways recently’, I have just the thing for you.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, Netflix do because they’re working with the comedian and actor on a new show about a magical record player, à la <i>The Mighty Boosh</i>.</p>
      <p>The <i>Great British Bake-Off</i> judge revealed that he’s got the sign-off from Netflix on the show, and he’s all set to begin writing soon.</p>

      <p>Noel made the announcement while chatting to Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 6 Music, as per <i><a href="https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2019/11/07/44707/netflix_series_for_noel_fielding">Chortle</a></i>, and explained that the record player will let you ‘go inside your favourite albums’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>He continued:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Basically a guy gets hold of a magic record player and when you put the record player on a portal appears and you can go inside your favourite albums.<br/><br/>It’s a good concept but how I write it, I could come at it from many different angles and I’m trying to work out the best way.<br/><br/>I haven’t written it yet. I pitched it and Netflix liked it and we’re making it, but I haven’t started writing it yet. So that’s my next thing.</blockquote>

      <p>The six-part series is being co-written by Matt Haydock, creator of the cult comedy phenomenon <i>Gus The Fox</i>, with the two having previously worked together when Noel wrote the introduction to his 2013 book.</p>
      <p>The <i>Mighty Boosh</i> star said the project was the one thing he wanted to do on television before devoting himself full time to painting, stating: ‘So I have to get my art hat off and put my writing hat back on, which I don’t even know where it is.’</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first comedy venture of Noel’s in recent months; earlier this year, the comedian reunited with his <i>Mighty Boosh</i> co-star Julian Barratt for the first time in five years to become the UK’s Record Store Day ambassadors for 2019.</p>

      <p>The duo joined forces once more to champion independent record stores across the UK, while at the same time releasing the complete <i>Mighty Boosh</i> radio series on vinyl for the first time so that fans of the show could experience it on three pieces of coloured 180g vinyl.</p>
      <p>Speaking of their decision to do so, Julian explained, in his usual eccentric way: ‘It suddenly felt prescient to outwit [computers] and somehow save our precious early recordings onto a format that the dawning artificial intelligence will not see as a threat.’</p>
      <p>Noel explained it in a slightly more relatable way, stating: ‘You want some vinyl expert to tell you about a record you’ve never heard of. That’s the beauty of it.’</p>
      <p>Who else can’t wait for the magical record player?</p>
