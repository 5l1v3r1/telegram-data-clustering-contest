      <h1>Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order: How to change and unlock lightsaber colours</h1>

      <h3>Some Jedis like to stand out from the blue or green crowd.</h3>
      <p>Cal begins <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/"><i>Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order</i></a> with a blue lightsaber, but the entire weapon can be customised including its colour. However, the colours available are determined by how far you are into the story, and if you pre-ordered or not.</p>
      <p>From the beginning, all players can choose a blue or green lightsaber. This can be customised at any workbench, including on the Mantis. Players who pre-ordered also have access to an orange blade, which cannot be obtained any other way.</p>
      <h4>Other lightsaber colours</h4>

      <p>Other lightsaber colours become available to Cal later in the game, including purple, yellow, cyan, magenta and indigo, joining blue and green (and orange if you pre-ordered). This upgrade can’t be missed and is part of the story.</p>
      <p>Some of these colours are very similar, but to my eye, cyan is closer to how Luke’s lightsaber looks in <i>A New Hope</i>. Indigo resembles Obi-Wan’s blade in <i>The Phantom Menace</i>.</p>
      <p>While red lightsabers are quite common, Cal can’t customise his to have a red blade, because he’s a good young Jedi.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Spoilers below – when do all these colours unlock? </b>

      <p>If you’re still reading, you probably want to know exactly when Cal can go full Mace Windu with a purple lightsaber. It happens around two thirds of the way through the story, after Cal breaks his original lightsaber and goes to the Jedi temple to make a new one, in Chapter 5.</p>
      <p>The scene makes it seem like you have one choice; that you must choose one colour kyber crystal and that’s Cal’s new look. However, it doesn’t matter which you pick. It can be changed at any time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/"><i>Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order</i> </a>is out today on PS4, Xbox One and PC.</p>
