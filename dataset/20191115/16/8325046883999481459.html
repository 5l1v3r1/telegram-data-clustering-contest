      <p>I like potatoes, and I like chocolate. So, when I heard about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trader-joes-releases-chocolate-lava-gnocchi-2019-11">Trader Joe’s new Chocolate Lava Gnocchi dividing the internet</a>, I knew I had to give them a try.</p>
      <p>After grabbing the very last bag of the potato entrée-turned-dessert from my local <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/trader-joes">Trader Joe’s</a>, I headed home to put them to the test.</p>
      <p>They were very easy to prepare, only taking six minutes and a couple of ingredients.</p>
      <p>However, while I did enjoy the gnocchi’s rich chocolate lava filling, I couldn’t help but notice the distinct potato texture of the balls themselves.</p>
      <p>Don’t get me wrong, I truly think everyone should give this unique dessert a try. However, for this taste-tester, as much as I wanted them to be a match in dessert heaven, potato and chocolate simply don’t go together.</p>

      <h3>When I first picked up a bag of Trader Joe’s Chocolate Lava Gnocchi, I was skeptical about how a potato entrée could make its way into the dessert aisle. Having always been a fan of both gnocchi and chocolate lava cakes, however, I decided to give the dish a try.</h3>

      <h3>The gnocchi are prepared in a similar way to other TJ’s gnocchi products, by sautéing them in a pan over medium heat with butter or ghee. I chose to use butter, but non-dairy substitutes would work as well.</h3>

      <h3>Next, I put two tablespoons of butter into a pan and began to melt it on medium heat. My stove is extremely temperamental and gets hot very quickly, so I had to work fast.</h3>

      <h3>Before long, my gnocchi appeared to be almost done. They looked like little cakes or bonbons, and the buttery, chocolatey smell emitting from the pan was truly mouthwatering.</h3>

      <h3>After my timer went off, the gnocchi were crispy on some sides and doughy on others. Against the white pan, it was hard to ignore the fact that they looked like little chocolate turds. I only prayed that the small chocolate dumplings tasted better than they looked.</h3>

      <h3>I bit into the gnocchi piece and was pleasantly surprised by the chocolate inside. It was rich, creamy, and delicious. However, as I continued eating my first piece, I couldn’t get past the distinct potato-like texture of the gnocchi.</h3>

      <h3>Though it didn’t exactly taste like potato gnocchi, the texture was virtually the same with some chocolate sauce added to the center. I decided to try the gnocchi with light whipped cream, but the gnocchi may also pair well with vanilla ice cream.</h3>

      <h3>The whipped cream didn’t really add anything, and actually took away from the rich chocolate flavor. If anything, the added moisture made the gnocchi balls chewier than they already were, which I didn’t enjoy.</h3>

      <h3>Overall, I was torn on whether I liked Trader Joe’s new Chocolate Lava Gnocchi. While the rich, chocolatey flavor of the molten lava was a total win for me, I simply couldn’t get past the distinct, chewy potato texture of the gnocchi. Perhaps potatoes and chocolate are simply one combination I can’t agree with.</h3>
