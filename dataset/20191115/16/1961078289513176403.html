      <h1>Tensions Over Genres and Generations Linger at Latin Grammys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:58:38+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Caramanica</a></address>
      <p>Over the last few years, the expansion of reggaeton and the rise of Latin trap have been two of the most significant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/20/arts/music/new-pop-music.html?module=inline">evolutions in global pop music</a>. Stars like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/arts/music/popcast-bad-bunny.html?module=inline">Bad Bunny</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/arts/music/ozuna-odisea-latin-pop.html?module=inline">Ozuna</a>, Maluma, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/arts/music/j-balvin-energia-interview.html?module=inline">J Balvin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/arts/music/nicky-jam-fenix-reggaeton-interview.html?module=inline">Nicky Jam</a> and others have upended Spanish-language pop with sounds that are utterly modern and outrageously popular.</p>
      <p>So when the nominations for the 20th annual Latin Grammy Awards were announced in September, the slight was very clear: No reggaeton or Latin trap artists were up for the biggest categories, which were largely given over to longtime favorites making more traditional, staid music. Many of the reggaeton community’s biggest figures — including J Balvin and Daddy Yankee, a star of an earlier generation — <a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/latin-grammys-controversy-2019/">spoke out</a> against what they perceived as a sign of systematic disrespect to their sound.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/arts/music/grammy-awards-review.html?module=inline">Like the Grammys</a>, the Latin Grammys have a clear generational problem, and also a genre problem, the byproduct of a voting body that evolves far more slowly than the music world itself does.</p>
      <p>And so the efforts toward demonstrating balance were strenuous at this year’s Latin Grammys ceremony, which was held Thursday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, and broadcast on Univision. Though several reggaeton stars chose not to attend, others used the opportunity to advocate for their scene.</p>
      <p>Bad Bunny won best urban album for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/arts/music/bad-bunny-x-100pre-review.html?module=inline">“X 100PRE,”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yz2gyfYokY">in his speech</a>, both urged more serious consideration of the genre and encouraged his fellow artists to push themselves creatively. His performance of “Callaíta” with an orchestra, which closed the show, was one of the highlights. Earlier, the Panamanian reggaeton singer Sech gave an impressive performance (alongside the rapper Darell) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9bwiNL1h7w">of his hit “Otro Trago,”</a> one of this year’s most sumptuous songs, before being joined by the genre-crossing superstar Ozuna for “Si Te Vas.”</p>
      <p>Best urban song was awarded to “Con Altura,” by Rosalía and J Balvin, which proved problematic in a pair of ways. First, J Balvin did not attend the ceremony, in protest. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/08/magazine/rosalia-flamenco.html?module=inline">Rosalía, a flamenco prodigy from Spain</a> who is a burgeoning pop avant-gardist, isn’t strictly speaking, a reggaeton artist. Along with Alejandro Sanz and Enrique Iglesias, who have been feted at these ceremonies over the years, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/media/2019/10/rosalia-and-the-blurry-borders-of-what-it-means-to-be-a-latin-artist/">she is European, not a Latin artist</a>.</p>
      <p>Rosalía also won album of the year and best contemporary pop vocal album for “El Mal Querer.” Sanz, too, won three awards, including record of the year and best pop song for “Mi Persona Favorita,” his duet with Camila Cabello.</p>
      <p>The Latin Grammys reward a wide range of genres: various regional Mexican styles, Portugese-language music, tropical, rock, jazz and more. The show also made efforts to include a handful of English-language guests. Alessia Cara performed with the Colombian singer Juanes, and Alicia Keys performed a song with Miguel, and then with Pedro Capó and Farruko on “Calma,” one of the summer’s big hits. Additionally, Lars Ulrich of Metallica presented Juanes with the Latin Recording Academy person of the year award.</p>
      <p>There were moments — particularly in the opening performance number — that attempted to build similar bridges between younger and more established performers. But none of them succeeded quite like the collaboration between the ranchera legend Vicente Fernandez, his son Alejandro and his grandson Alex. Of the three, Vicente was the clear star, delivering “Volver Volver” with a meaty intensity. More than six decades into his career, he still sang like he was trying to earn his spot on the stage.</p>
