      <h1>Detroit Lions Announce Matthew Stafford’s Status vs. Cowboys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:59:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>After seeing his 136-game start streak snapped last week against the Chicago Bears with an injury, Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford has had his status up in the air for Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
      <p>Lions head coach Matt Patricia updated Stafford’s status – and it doesn’t bode well for the team’s chances.</p>
      <p>Patricia said in his Friday press conference that Stafford has been ruled out for the game. He is currently dealing with <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/nfc-north/detroit-lions/injury-update-matthew-stafford-lions-espn">broken bones in his back as well as a hip injury</a>.</p>
      <p>As a result, backup Jeff Driskel will start for the second straight week. Driskell went 27 of 46 for 269 yards, one touchdown and one interception in last week’s 20-13 loss to the Bears.</p>

      <p>The Detroit Lions are 3-5-1 on the season – last place in the NFC North and 13th in the NFC standings.</p>
      <p>Though they’ll be the home team against the visiting Cowboys, it’s hard to imagine the Lions having enough firepower.</p>
      <p>The Lions have stopped short of ruling out Stafford for the rest of the year. But if he doesn’t return soon, the Lions may already be out of it by the time he returns.</p>
      <p>Will we see Matthew Stafford take the field again for the Lions in 2019?</p>
