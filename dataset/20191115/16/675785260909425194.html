      <h2>WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Amputee Mandy Horvath decided to ship her legs rather than take them on the plane, but she says they were lost in transit by United States Postal Service</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:19:16+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:19</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly-Ann Mills, Mollie Mansfield, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>An amputee has made an urgent plea for help to 'find her legs' after claiming the £55,000 prosthetics were lost in transit by United States Postal Service.</p>
      <p>Mandy Horvath had planned a trip to Florida to receive prosthesis care, and - due to weight restrictions on the flight - decided to ship her prosthetic legs from Colorado.</p>
      <p>However, after claiming the legs were expected to arrive in Florida on 30 October, Mandy, 26, was left panicking when there was no sign of them.</p>
      <p>As the days went on, Mandy and the prosthetic team at 50Legs.org were constantly contacting USPS, but claim they have received no further information on where her legs are or when they might arrive.</p>
      <p>Now, two weeks after her legs were supposed to be delivered, Mandy is making a plea to the public to help her find her missing legs so that she can walk again.</p>
      <p>Mandy said: "My two ottobock C-legs, sockets and feet were shipped via USPS from Colorado to my destination, Florida.</p>

      <p>"These items are still not in Florida, two weeks later.</p>
      <p>"They cost more than anything I own - the set up alone is roughly $70,000 just in equipment, not to mention labour costs.</p>
      <p>"USPS aren't even sure what happened to the shipment - we were first told they could be at the Jacksonville USPS distribution center and as of last week we we're told they may have never even left Denver.</p>
      <p>"The entire 50legs crew - who I'm in Florida to receive care from - is trying to work with post masters to find this very important equipment.</p>
      <p>"As of right now Prosthetics and Orthotics Association is allowing me to use two loaner c-legs for test fittings.</p>
      <p>"This has made me feel absolutely terrible.</p>
      <p>"Not only are my limbs that have sentimental value to me missing, but I'm taking away from the experience of other amputees that need to use these loaners.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"I may be out of $70,000 and my opportunity at walking ambulatory, it's so disheartening.</p>
      <p>"I definitely won't ship with USPS again - I trusted them with my lifeline once and a mistake such as that wont ever happen again."</p>
      <p>Mandy initially lost her real legs when she was just 21 years old in July 2014, and had to wait another year to receive her prosthetics.</p>
      <p>Talking about the incident, Mandy said: "It wasn’t until April 2015 that I was able to try my prosthetics.</p>
      <p>"The first prosthetics that I was given were suction sockets – and because my body weight was fluctuating regularly it meant that my legs would fall off.</p>
      <p>"But when I moved from Kansas to Colorado I was able to get better prosthetics and these are the ones that are missing.</p>
      <p>"I learnt how to walk in them so well, and they gave me back a lot of freedom that was taken from me when I lost my legs.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to have to go through this grueling process all over again, so I really need people to try and help me find my legs!" </p>
      <p>USPS has been contacted for a comment.</p>
