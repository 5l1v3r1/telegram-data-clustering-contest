      <h1>China's Xi calls Hong Kong unrest 'urgent' in rare comment on protests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:56:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">Jasmine Leung and Reuters </a></address>
      <p>HONG KONG — In a rare public intervention on the subject, Chinese President Xi Jinping said <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-police-clash-protesters-tense-standoff-violence-continues-n1080501">spiraling protests in Hong Kong</a> were challenging the "one country, two systems" principle ruling the mainland's relations to the semi-autonomous region.</p>
      <p>Halting the clashes and "controlling chaos" was the most urgent task facing Hong Kong officials, Xi said during a trip to Brazil Thursday, adding that the "continuous violence and crimes are seriously jeopardizing justice and public safety."</p>
      <p>Protests in the former British colony — which operates under the one country, two system that allows it greater liberties compared to its mainland counterparts — were sparked six months ago by a controversial extradition bill. These quickly morphed into sometimes huge and violent demonstrations with broader demands for more democracy and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Beijing denies it has interfered in Hong Kong's management of the months of spiraling violence, and instead <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-violence-escalates-china-tells-u-s-back-n1081081">blames the West for fomenting the protests</a> that pose one of the most serious challenges to Xi since he came to power in 2012.</p>
      <p>Xi's comments came the same day a 70-year-old hit by bricks police said had been thrown by "masked rioters" died.</p>

      <p>Police have called the actions of the protesters "riotous" and called them "rioters," terms demonstrators contest.</p>
      <p>Police said the man, who they identified as "Luo," was believed to have been on his way to lunch when he was hit during a clash between protesters and local residents, police superintendent Chan Tin Chu told reporters.</p>
      <p>"We believed that Luo was filming the scene when black-clad protesters began throwing metal rods and bricks at residents. Then somebody in black dashed forward and hurled a brick at his head," said Chan.</p>
      <p>Luo was found unconscious on the spot, taken to a hospital emergency room, and then later transferred to the neurosurgery high-dependency unit.</p>
      <p>NBC News could not confirm the police's version of events.</p>
      <p>Thursday's death capped a week of violence. On Monday, police blamed a "rioter" for dousing a man in petrol and setting him on fire. The victim is in critical condition.</p>
      <p>On the same day, police shot a protester in the abdomen. He is in stable condition.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, violence spiraled at prestigious Chinese University of Hong Kong, as police were accused by protesters of charging onto the campus to detain demonstrators without letting the university know.</p>
      <p>The university ended its semester early along with several schools and colleges.</p>
      <p>Traffic disruptions and class suspensions have become routine for Hong Kong as protesters try to paralyze the city with flash mobs protests.</p>
      <p>While white collar workers have also been heeding online calls to "lunch together" every day — a euphemism for marching at lunchtime — universities have morphed into new battlegrounds were students barricade roads and trains using flaming arrows and catapults.</p>
