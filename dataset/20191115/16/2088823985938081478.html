      <p>Three patrol cars pull up to the curb and Lt. Mitchell Thomas and three other uniformed Buffalo Police officers walk up the stairs leading up to the porch of a two-unit house on a busy road near the 33 Expressway.</p>
      <p>Thomas knocks on the door, holding a printout of a screenshot from Facebook. It shows what appears to be a handgun with an emoji over it.</p>
      <p>A man answers the door and Thomas asks him if he’s the father of the young man who posted the gun photo on social media, showing him the image.</p>
      <p>“I talked to him after the last time,” the father says, shaking his head.</p>
      <p>“He ain’t stopped,” Thomas replies.</p>
      <p>But the cops aren’t there to arrest the son. Or question someone. Or seize any evidence.</p>
      <p>They're here because they hope they don't have to return. They're here to prevent a shooting.</p>
      <p>Called “custom notifications,” the Buffalo Police Department has been employing a crime prevention strategy gaining traction across the country in which police officers pay visits to the homes of young people who appear to be heading down a dangerous path.</p>
      <p>They try to talk to the young people themselves and their families, too, to alert them that police are watching them.</p>
      <p>That’s the first step.</p>
      <p>Then, officers joined with anti-street crime activists work with the young person and their loved ones on finding ways to steer the youth toward a better path.</p>
      <p>“The whole idea is: If you get them to put the guns down, then no one’s getting shot,” said Deputy Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia, who has championed custom notifications in Buffalo.</p>
      <p>While it’s hard to quantify how effective the strategy is, some indications suggest it might be working.</p>
      <p>Through the end of August, <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/11/13/despite-decline-in-shootings-some-buffalo-neighborhoods-still-hit-hard/">119 people were shot in Buffalo</a>. That’s the lowest number over the eight-month period in at least nine years, according to Buffalo Police Department statistics.</p>
      <p>That figure represents a 28% decrease in persons shot compared to the average over the same period from 2011 through 2018, according to department statistics.</p>
      <p>It’s a 29% drop compared to the same period in 2018.</p>
      <p>It’s gotten some national attention too. Buffalo’s program was recently featured in <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/11/15/stopping-shootings-with-a-knock-at-the-door-from-a-cop/.%20https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/can-thomas-abts-bleeding-out-curb-gun-violence/596164/">an article that appeared in The Atlantic</a>.</p>

      <p>Erie County District Attorney John J. Flynn said he believes the custom notifications are a “driving factor” in the reduction of gun violence.</p>
      <p>“You’re defusing future violence,” he said. “You’re defusing arguments and beefs that individuals have that, if unchecked, percolate into violence.”</p>
      <p>The one-on-one meetings, combined with other community policing strategies implemented by Police Commissioner Byron Lockwood including the BPD’s Neighborhood Engagement Team, are helping build trust between police and the public, Flynn said.</p>
      <p>Flynn, elected this summer as a vice president of the National District Attorneys Association, said he is working with Gramaglia on a way to show cities around the country how to replicate the program.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to give this to every DA in every big city across the country,” Flynn said. “That’s how much I believe in this. It’s working. It’s working.”</p>
      <h3>Operation Ceasefire</h3>
      <p>It’s not a new idea. In the mid-1990s amid of a spike in homicides especially among youth, Boston famously launched Operation Ceasefire. Police there worked with anti-violence groups to do call-in sessions. Gang members, particularly those on probation or parole, would be called in to a formal meeting where law enforcement officers or a judge would warn them about the consequences of violent acts.</p>
      <p>Other cities followed.</p>
      <p>The custom notifications strategy that Buffalo is now using takes it a step further.</p>
      <p>“You can’t just say: Get out of the life and stop committing crime,” Gramaglia said. “You have to provide that safety net.”</p>
      <p>That’s where the “community partners” come in.</p>
      <p>Buffalo police work with the Buffalo Peacemakers to figure out a plan for the young person being “notified.” That could be helping them get into a GED program or connecting them with a job.</p>
      <p>Buffalo police have done custom notifications from time to time for several years, but now they’re being done on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>Last year, Buffalo police officers conducted a few dozen custom notifications. As of Nov. 5 this year, they have attempted 450.</p>
      <p>It’s funded through the state Division of Criminal Justice Service’s GIVE initiative, which stands for Gun Involved Violence Elimination and has provided $1.9 million to area programs including the BPD’s custom notifications. “We couldn’t do this without it,” Gramaglia said of the funding.</p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>Police officers identify young people for the notifications in a number of ways. The police look at postings on social media, especially ones where they’re flashing guns or making violent threats. They also look at young people arrested repeatedly for minor crimes or ones who are stopped with other people suspected in more serious crimes.</p>
      <p>To narrow their focus, police officers start with what they call “mini-notifications.” A team dedicates a few hours once a week to going to the homes of a half dozen candidates.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, they end up getting doors slammed in their faces.</p>
      <p>But other times, family members are open to the idea of the police and others to meet with their child for more in-depth "custom notifications." These are often done on Saturday mornings, and involve police officers, as well as members of other law enforcement and community partners, usually Murray Holman and Ken "Blue" Stephens, who are members of the Peacemakers organization.</p>

      <p>Holman and Stephens say they play "good cop/bad cop" with the young person, making sure they understand the consequences of gun violence. Stephens tries to impress upon the young person the impact their behavior has on their family, pointing out all the law enforcement cars outside as they're meeting. "You're embarrassing your mother," he said he tells them. But by the end of the session, they try to make sure the young man hugs his mother.</p>
      <p>As of Nov. 5, police have attempted 450 mini-notifications, targeting 295 people. Of those, police have made contact with either the targeted person or their families in 266 cases.</p>
      <p>So far this year, five of those targeted subjects have been shot – none fatally – and 15 have been arrested for gun-related crimes, police said.</p>
      <p>"I take away from that that we're targeting the worst of the worst and I think we're having a big impact," Gramaglia said.</p>
      <p>Families are often surprised when they’re shown screenshots of their children holding guns, Gramaglia said. “Sometimes they’re in shock. Sometimes they’re in disbelief. Sometimes, they don’t care. That’s the unfortunate side. But when you get mom or grandma on your side, sometimes they want to take action and they’re very thankful for it.”</p>
      <p>The police and community partners try to figure out a plan for the youth. They try to connect them with a job or get them to go back to school. Now, they’re also hoping to connect the youth to jobs in manufacturing through the Buffalo Employment Training Center and the Northland Workforce Training Center, which opened last year on the East Side.</p>
      <p>Gramaglia acknowledged that not everyone is on board.</p>
      <p>“There was some pushback by some of the officers. They say 'you’re telling these guys we know what they’re doing. You’re giving up our intel.' ”</p>
      <p>But Gramaglia said that’s not the point. “The point is to get you to put the guns down,” he said.</p>
      <p>And even if the young person doesn’t end up pursuing one of those avenues, police believe they’re making a dent in violence just by letting them know the police see when they post threats and images of guns on social media.</p>
      <p>“What happens is they’ll stop posting,” said Chief Carmen Menza, who is in charge of E-District, the Northeast District of the city. “If they stop posting, they stop threatening each other. That’s where a lot of the gun violence comes from.”</p>
      <p>The police realize it’s not a panacea to all gun violence.</p>
      <p>“But we try,” Menza said. “Instead of just ignoring these pictures on social media – all these postings that we see of kids with guns – at least, we’re trying to do something to change the outcome.”</p>
      <p>The police tell the parents that too.</p>
      <p>“At least we’re coming now. We’re coming before something bad happens,” Menza said.</p>
      <h3>Seeing cops talking to people</h3>
      <p>On a recent Thursday, Thomas and his officers from E-District, which covers the city's northeast quadrant, had a half-dozen printouts of social media screenshots with addresses handwritten next to them – the mini-notifications for the evening.</p>
      <p>They arrive at the first address – and a confused looking young man answers the door.</p>
      <p>He says they have the wrong address.</p>
      <p>“My brother’s already in prison and it’s just my mom and me,” he says.</p>
      <p>Thomas isn’t so sure, but they decide to move on.</p>
      <p>The second is the house where they talked to the dad about his son’s gun photo.</p>
      <p>The father says the weapon is actually a BB gun he bought from Walmart and that he already had made his son take a similar photo down from one of his social media sites.</p>
      <p>He says his son is a good kid who goes to school and gets good grades.</p>
      <p>“Nothing as far as a gang,” he says. But, he adds, “he has a couple of friends who recently were shot or killed.”</p>
      <p>That catches Thomas’ attention.</p>
      <p>“If a couple of his friends are shot ... I don’t know,” Thomas says. He tells the dad that could mean he’s hanging out with a bad crowd.</p>
      <p>“That’s based on experience,” Thomas says. “There aren’t too many random acts of violence.”</p>
      <p>The father nods.</p>
      <p>Thomas asks if he would be up for a full custom notification in the near future, and the father agrees.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want a good kid to slide into that direction,” Thomas said.</p>
      <p>Thomas, who is African American and grew up with a single mother in several East Side neighborhoods, feels like he can relate to many of the families he meets on the custom notifications. He hopes what he's doing is making a difference – in preventing crime and improving relations between police and poor communities of color.</p>
      <p>“It might be doing something,” he said. “And even if it isn’t, I believe at the very least, they’re seeing the police cars and it’s not in a negative way. They’re seeing police talking to people.”</p>
