      <p>The husband of a missing Missouri woman was caught on video buying cleaning products — including bleach and gloves — one day before she vanished, according to police.</p>
      <p>Beau Rothwell, 28, was charged Thursday with tampering with evidence in the case of 28-year-old Jennifer Rothwell, a chemical engineer last seen leaving her home in Creve Coeur early Tuesday, St. Louis County police said.</p>

      <p>Beau Rothwell, who sought help on Facebook Wednesday in the search for his wife, was spotted on video buying supplies like bleach, carpet cleaner and gloves two days earlier, according to a probable cause statement.</p>
      <p>Detectives also found a wet carpet soaked with bleach and “large areas of blood” in carpeting and an underlying pad during a search of the couple’s home Wednesday, indicating evidence of murder, police said in a news release.</p>
      <p>The missing person investigation for Jennifer Rothwell has now been reclassified to a homicide, although her body had not been found as of early Friday, police spokeswoman Tracy Panus told The Post.</p>
      <p>Officers searched her home and a wooded area late Thursday between where Jennifer’s car was found shortly after she was reported missing, <a href="https://www.kmov.com/news/jennifer-rothwell-missing-st-louis-county-woman/article_aa113324-061e-11ea-aeb5-fbbf8ada8723.html">KMOV reports</a>.</p>
      <p>A $25,000 reward for information about the woman’s whereabouts is being offered by Jennifer’s family, the station reports.</p>
      <p>Jennifer’s mother, Robin von Hausen, said Jennifer had just moved to the area with her husband and worked at DuPont, where one of her co-workers first suggested something might be wrong.</p>
      <p>“A co-worker texted and said, ‘Hey, how is Jennifer?’” von Hausen told the station. “They assumed she just hadn’t come into work because of the weather or whatnot.”</p>
      <p>Beau Rothwell, meanwhile, was arrested late Wednesday, just hours after <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157465032056011&amp;set=a.4901361010&amp;type=3&amp;theater">posting a plea for help on Facebook</a>.</p>
      <p>“Some of you may have heard already, but last night my wife Jennifer went missing,” he wrote. “I’ve filed a police report and the search is ongoing. Please, if you hear of anything or have any information it would be greatly appreciated.”</p>
