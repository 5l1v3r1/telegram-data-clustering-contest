      <h1>Great Britain 'still strong nation' despite narrowly missing medal target at World Para Championships</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:49:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ben-bloom/" target="_blank">Ben Bloom</a></address>
      <p>The head of Britain’s Paralympic athletics programme insists the team are in a strong position heading into Tokyo 2020, despite narrowly missing out on their medal target at the World Para Championships.</p>
      <p>Britain matched the third-place finish in the medal standings from London 2017, but dropped from 39 medals (including 18 golds) to 29 (including 13 golds).</p>
      <p>Their 24 to 28 medal target imposed by UK Sport only included events that will be contested at next year’s Paralympics, effectively reducing the team’s haul in Dubai this week to 23.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Paralympic head coach Paula Dunn says she is far from concerned, as a number of likely British medal contenders were absent.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done exceptionally well,” said Dunn. “The guys have come here and produced lots of personal bests and season’s bests, and some world records, so I’m really happy.</p>
      <p>“You’re always going to have disappointment but they’ve been minimal here, which is good 10 months away from Tokyo.</p>

      <p>“Jonnie Peacock, Stef Reid, Georgie Hermitage, Dan Greaves, Gemma Prescott and Stephen Miller are all not here - the plan was to get these guys fit and healthy for 2020, so not to rush anything. The medal table says that we are still a strong nation. I’m standing here happy and contented.”</p>
      <p>Dunn also insisted British Athletics is doing all it can to help Kadeena Cox after the Paralympic champion revealed she is struggling to cope with a serious eating disorder and told <i>The Telegraph</i>: “This has been the most I’ve struggled with it at a major championships.”</p>
      <p>Dunn said: “Anybody who has had a long-term addiction knows it’s not a quick fix. But she’s aware now and she’s getting support, not just internally from British Athletics and British Cycling, but externally.</p>
      <p>“She knows it’s going to be a long road to recovery so we’re just going to support her through that. We’re not the experts - the experts are managing and looking after her so we’re just following their advice.</p>
      <p>“All we can do is be guided by her and the team externally. We’re just there to support her through it. Her wellbeing is the most important thing.”</p>
      <p>Britain ended the competition on Friday night by claiming gold and silver in both the men and women’s race running events.</p>
      <p>Appearing at the World Para Championships for the first time, race running sees athletes with the most severe cerebral palsy and other neurological conditions use a tricycle without pedals for support. It is not yet a Paralympic discipline.</p>
      <p>Kayleigh Haggo and Gavin Drysdale claimed gold in the two RR3 100m finals, with Ellie Simpson and Rafi Solaiman taking silver.</p>
      <p>“Wow, I cannot believe it,” said Drysdale. “It’s absolutely amazing to have race running in the World Championships for the first time.</p>
      <p>“It gives the opportunity for people like me to compete at the highest level. I remember watching London two years ago wishing I could compete, so to be here two years later is a bit surreal.”</p>
