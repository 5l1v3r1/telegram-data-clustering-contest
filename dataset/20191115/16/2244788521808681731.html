        <b>A TOTAL of 30 Nigerian health professionals working in areas affected by armed conflict and violence have been trained on how to provide life-saving surgical care to weapon wounded patients in difficult environments with limited equipment and resources.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The training of the surgeons who were drawn from 20 states across the country was organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health.</p>
      <p>It included lifesaving techniques to manage injuries from explosions, abdominal and thoracic injuries as well as fractures from other weapons.</p>
      <p>A statement by the ICRC sent to <b>The ICIR</b> said the training was held in Abuja between November 12 and 14.</p>
      <p>“The seminar is of paramount importance as many people in areas affected by conflict and violence do not have access to basic health services,” said Eloi Fillion,  Head of the ICRC Delegation in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Repeated attacks against healthcare personnel and facilities make the situation even more dramatic.”</p>
      <p>It said all wounded people have the right to medical care according to international humanitarian law and the principles of medical ethics, and “the ICRC works to promote these principles.”</p>
      <p>The statement explained that ICRC in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Health has been organising surgical seminars in Nigeria since 2012 and has so far trained over 400 surgeons, nurses and anaesthetists.</p>
      <p>It revealed that surgical team in Maiduguri has this year operated about 1,700 casualties while over 260,000 persons received access to healthcare services in 20 primary healthcare centres supported by the ICRC.</p>
      <p>“Together with the Nigerian Red Cross, the organisation has provided first aid training to over 1,500 people in nineteen states of Nigeria,” the statement concluded.</p>
