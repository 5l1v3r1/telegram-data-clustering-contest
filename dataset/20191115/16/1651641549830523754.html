        <b>New subscribers to the Ultimate tier of Xbox Game Pass are getting a nice treat this holiday season in the form of free memberships to EA Access, Discord Nitro, and Spotify Premium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The deal gives you 1 free month of EA Access, 3 free months of Discord Nitro, and an entire 6 months of Spotify Premium. The best bit? You can currently get your first 3 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for just $1.</p>
      <p>That means that you’ll get multiple free memberships, Xbox Live Gold, and access to a giant library of games on both console and PC for just $1. A dollar! A single dollary-doo!</p>
      <p>If you’re not too sure what each membership actually gives you or what it even is, I’ve broken it down below.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>What is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is a subscription service that gives you unlimited access to over a hundred high-quality console and PC games (with more being added all the time), access to Xbox Game Studios titles upon their launch, exclusive member discounts and deals, and an Xbox Live Gold membership, the latter of which is worth $9.99/month on its own.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>What is EA Access?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>EA Access is EA’s own video game subscription service that gives you deals, bonuses, special offers, and access to a selection of handpicked games from EA. As a subscriber to the service, you can get access to new EA games before they’re even released, 10% off on EA digital purchases, instant access to a catalog of games, and more.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>What is Discord Nitro?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Discord Nitro is Discord’s own subscription service that allows Discord users to have an enhanced experience while also supporting the platform’s development.</p>
      <p>Nitro membership gives you perks such as custom Discord tags, the ability to upload GIFs for avatars and emojis, higher quality streams and video sharing, global custom emojis, server boosting, a special profile badge, and an improved upload limit amongst other things.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>What is Spotify Premium?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Imagine Spotify, but all your playlists are played in order, you can skip as many songs as you like, you can listen to your music offline, and there’s nobody shouting about ads in your ear every other minute. That’s Spotify Premium.</p>
