      <h1>The Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang promise to disappoint Barcelona fans over Arsenal transfer rumours</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal striker has been linked with a move to Barcelona</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:59:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang previously revealed that he 'dreams' of playing for Real Madrid and promised his grandfather he would join the Spanish side one day.</p>
      <p>The striker has established himself as one of the most feared strikers in Europe since joining Arsenal in January 2018, and his form has reportedly attracted interest from Barcelona.</p>
      <p>According to French outlet Le10 Sport, the La Liga side are keen to sign a forward in the January transfer window, and are eyeing a move for the Arsenal forward.</p>
      <p>The report does say however, that Barcelona are yet to make an official approach.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang has scored nine goals in 13 appearances so far this season, something which, according to former Arsenal transfer chief Mislintat, is even more impressive considering his selfless nature on the pitch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1283326/2019/10/11/look-beyond-the-garish-clothes-and-fast-cars-aubameyang-is-an-absolute-team-player-who-should-be-arsenal-captain/?redirected=1">Speaking to The Athletic</a> , he said: "He is one, possibly the only one, of these extraordinary top, top, top strikers who is an absolute team player.</p>
      <p>"A striker like Neymar or (Sergio) Aguero, for example, would never give a penalty to Pepe to score his first goal. It’s vice versa — ‘Come on, <i>I</i> will take this penalty kick, nobody else!’ Auba gave the chance to Pepe.</p>
      <p>"His instinct was, ‘Let’s score and let’s go forward together.’ He takes care about his team-mates.</p>
      <p>“Since he joined Arsenal, he played where he was asked and needed, and so he helped especially Lacazette to adapt to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"Maybe this attitude costs him to play for clubs like Real Madrid or Barcelona but maybe they made a mistake not to go for him. I like his mindset. It is good for a team’s atmosphere.”</p>
      <p>But Aubameyang confirmed his ambitions of playing for Real Madrid, something which could make a move to fierce rivals Barcelona more unlikely in the future.</p>
      <p>"Yes. It's a promise I made to my grandfather," he told beIN Sports after a Champions League match whilst at Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>"Right now I feel very good at Dortmund but in the future we'll see."</p>
