      <p><b>News</b> by Matt Wales, Reporter Updated on 15 November 2019</p>
      <p>Jurassic World Evolution is going back to where in all began in its next DLC on 10th December, transplanting its dinosaur theme park management action to the original Jurassic Park.</p>
      <p>According to developer Frontier, Return to Jurassic Park, as the new paid DLC will be known, features locations, park designs, dinosaurs, and characters from the original film.</p>
      <p>The DLC's seven new story missions, which play out across both Isla Nublar (the location of Jurassic Park itself) and Isla Sorna (better known as Site B), will, for instance, task players with restoring John Hammond's park following its destruction in the 1993 movie.</p>

      <p>Familiar characters including Dr. Alan Grant, Dr. Ellie Sattler, and Dr. Ian Malcolm are back - with Sam Neil, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum returning to portray their original roles - and players will have the opportunity to construct buildings and attractions inspired by the first movie, including Jurassic Park's iconic main gates and the Park Tour.</p>
      <p>Frontier says to expect new dinosaurs, including the Compsognathus and Pteranodon, as well as legacy skin variants, such as 1993 versions of the Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor. Additionally, players can add a touch more nostalgic authenticity to Jurassic World Evolution by enabling a special 1993-inspired overlay and inventory.</p>
      <p>Jurassic World Evolution: Return to Jurassic Park will cost £15.99/$19.99 USD when comes to PC, PS4, and Xbox One on 10th December, and the DLC will be accompanied by a free update for all players. This will include a variety to changes to the likes of ranger interactions with dinosaurs and guest toilet needs as well as general fixes and enhancements.</p>
