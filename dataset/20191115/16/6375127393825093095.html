      <h3>While some schools in the Philippines have integrated technology into their curriculum, many have yet to take steps towards digitalization — and may not even know where to start.</h3>
      <p>Recognizing the need of educational institutions to adopt global practices of information and communications technology (ICT) enabled learning, and the lack of awareness or resources of schools to keep up, Globe is taking huge strides to ensure that key people in the academe are equipped with knowledge and skills that will help them groom future-ready students.</p>
      <p>In partnership with First City Providential College (FCPC), Globe, through the Globe myBusiness Academy, conducted E-skwela, a professional development workshop designed to educate school administrators, key decision makers, and faculty members on learning technologies and their integration in the school system. FCPC offers relevant and multidisciplinary academic programs that aim to produce lifelong learners who are globally competitive and socially responsible professionals. One of its academic goals is to produce viable research for local and international publications as well as to implement collaborative and sustainable community extension services.</p>
      <p>Through the workshop, participants adopted techniques for facilitating activities that are intentionally experiential, collaborative, and reflective to maximize learning. It helped create a mindset and knowledge base for people in the academe that, in turn, equips them for integrating tech in the classroom and molding future-ready students.</p>
      <p>"Technology integration in schools is something that we need to embrace as part of developing 21st Century Skills among teachers and students.  It is our vision in Globe myBusiness to create an interactive and competitive environment for schools in the country through the use of information and communications technology," said Anne David, Marketing Director, Globe myBusiness, the micro, small, and medium enterprise arm of Globe.</p>
      <p>The workshop held in FCPC’s Bulacan campus featured experts on tech-enabled learning. Invited speakers included Woohoo Learning Lab COO Galvin Radley Ngo, Habi Education Lab Executive Director Gerson Abesamis, and D2L Brightspace Regional Director for Asia Nick Hutton.</p>
      <p>Ngo gave a lecture on School Digitization and Technology Integration. There was also a panel discussion on Future-ready Education led by Mark Abalos, Education Industry Lead of Globe, Virginia Andres, Special Projects Officer for Knowledge Management and Innovation at the Philippine Science High School and Rogelio dela Cruz, Education Technology Office Head of the Center for Instruction, Research, and Curriculum of the De La Salle College of Saint Benilde offered their insights alongside Hutton and Abesamis in this session.</p>
      <p>Parallel workshop sessions were conducted to foster practical application of learned principles and interaction among participants.</p>
      <p>Previously, Globe has implemented training programs for teachers, such as the Global Filipino Teachers (GFT) and PRISM digital literacy program. To bridge the ICT gaps in schools, Globe also launched its suite of educational solutions a few years ago to harmonize the learning environment with the digital world and create a more interactive experience for students.</p>
      <p>Through E-skwela and the aforementioned projects, Globe bolsters its aim to digitally transform schools and prepare students for 21st century learning.</p>
