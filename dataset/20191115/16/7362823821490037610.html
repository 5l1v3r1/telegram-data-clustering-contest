      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/pet-health">cat food</a> distributed and sold throughout retail locations nationwide has been <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/product-recalls">recalled </a>over fears that it may be contaminated with salmonella. Go Raw, LLC, which produces “Quest Beef Cat Food,” said its 2-pound frozen bags were flagged after the Minnesota Department of Agriculture reported a sample tested positive for salmonella.</p>

      <p>Salmonella may cause humans to experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever, and is estimated to cause about 1.35 million illnesses and 420 deaths each year, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/salmonella-symptoms.html">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</a> Pets that become infected with salmonella may appear lethargic, also have diarrhea, develop a fever and exhibit vomiting. Some may only have decreased appetite, fever, and abdominal pain, but they can be carriers of the illness and infect other animals or pets.</p>
