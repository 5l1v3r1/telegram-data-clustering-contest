      <p>A tabloid claims <b>Angelina Jolie</b> is scheming to escape Los Angeles with her kids by demanding so much child support from <b>Brad Pitt</b> that he’ll be forced to let her leave. The story is both untrue and illogical. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can debunk it.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29644077/angelina-jolie-interview-2019/">Jolie said in a <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> cover story</a> that she’d love to move abroad with her children but has to remain in Los Angeles “where their father chooses to live.” According to the <i><b>National Enquirer</b></i>, the actress has a plan to circumvent her estranged husband by “planning an all-out assault until he pays her to leave.”</p>
      <p>“Angie will make him pay for this – literally,” a supposed source tells the outlet. The alleged insider says the actress will be so unreasonable when it comes to asking for child support that Pitt will have no choice but to let her move to avoid forking over the money. “Knowing Angie, she’ll get her lawyers to make this a primary focus of the divorce,” adds the suspicious tipster.</p>
      <p>The tabloid’s article is total fiction. For starters, Jolie noted in her <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> interview that she plans to live abroad “as soon as my children are 18.” If she had some sort of scheme to move them out of the country in the near future, why would she indicate she’ll only do so once they’re of legal age?</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the magazine is essentially accusing Jolie of practicing extortion, but a judge ruled last year that she needed to allow the kids to spend more time with their father or she’d risk losing primary custody. The actress has since consented to those terms. Demanding an astronomical amount of child support wouldn’t help her case.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the tabloid’s report only makes sense if a judge actually approved of Jolie’s supposed child support demands, and there’s no indication a judge would force Pitt to pay any amount his estranged wife asks for. In fact, when <a href="https://theblast.com/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-custody-officially-filed/">Jolie and Pitt reached a temporary custody agreement</a> last year, part of the process involved handing over financial information to each other’s legal teams. Pitt’s lawyers are aware of how much Jolie actually needs to properly care for her children, and it’s highly unlikely the court would allow her to go way beyond that amount.</p>
      <p>Those factoids only help poke holes in the magazine’s premise, but it isn’t true regardless. <b>Gossip Cop</b> reached out to a mutual pal of ours and Jolie, who assures us the story is fabricated. The actress isn’t plotting to escape Los Angeles by demanding unnecessary child support.</p>
      <p>The <i>Enquirer</i> has a habit of coming up with ways of Jolie supposedly getting revenge against her ex. Just last week, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out the publication for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-x-rated-videos/">Jolie planned to leak X-rated videos of her and Pitt</a> to cast him in a negative light. That story also lacked logic. Even if those tapes exist, and there’s no indication that they do, the actress would also be featured in them.</p>
      <p>This past March, the tabloid wrongly reported <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-moving-new-york-get-away/">Jolie was moving to New York with her kids to get away from Pitt</a>. As noted above, she can’t legally leave Los Angeles, but the actress also made it clear she’d live overseas if she had the option of moving. The outlet clearly knows very little about the exes’ ongoing divorce proceedings.</p>
