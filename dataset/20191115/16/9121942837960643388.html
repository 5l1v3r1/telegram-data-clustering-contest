      <p>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man has been sentenced to eight years in prison after pleading guilty to a lesser charge in the hate-crime beating death of a Guatemalan man.</p>
      <p>The Palm Beach Post reports that 22-year-old Jesse Harris pleaded guilty Friday to aggravated battery while committing evidence of prejudice. He had been facing a first-degree murder charge.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Harris, his brother David Harris and Austin Taggart attacked 18-year-old Onesimo Marcelino Lopez-Ramos in April 2015. Prosecutors say the group was prowling Jupiter streets, specifically targeting someone of Guatemalan heritage.</p>
      <p>Investigators say Lopez-Ramos died after his skull was cracked with an ax by David Harris.</p>
      <p>David Harris was sentenced to life in prison last year after a jury convicted him of first-degree murder.</p>
      <p>Taggart received 20 years last week after pleading guilty to second-degree murder and aggravated battery while committing evidence of prejudice.</p>
