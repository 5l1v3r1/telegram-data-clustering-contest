      <p>While former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch's testified this morning during the public impeachment hearing, Trump bashed her in a couple of tweets. And when Yovanovitch was later asked by Rep. Adam Schiff how these tweets might affect other "witnesses' willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing," she said "well, it's very intimidating." She then said, "I can't speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating."</p>
      <p>In one tweet, Trump says, "Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors."</p>

      <p>And in the other: "....They call it “serving at the pleasure of the President.” The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than proceeding administrations. It is called, quite simply, America First! With all of that, however, I have done FAR more for Ukraine than O."</p>
