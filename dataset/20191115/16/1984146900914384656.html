      <p>Whether you want to admit it or not, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas out there, which means that many people's thoughts, if they haven't already, have turned to present shopping.</p>
      <p>And a place which is expected to see plenty of people through its doors is intu Metrocentre.</p>
      <p>If you've paid the Gateshead shopping mall a visit over the past few weekends you'll know it's steadily getting busier in the run up to Santa coming.</p>
      <p>Last year, the<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/metrocentre"> Metrocentre</a> put plans in place to extend its opening hours over the festive season so that shoppers can pace themselves, factor in some buy-time after work and hit the shops at quieter times late into evening.</p>
      <p>And it's the same last year, with the reveal of the centre's opening hours for Christmas 2019, with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/eldon-square-christmas-opening-times-15435222">Eldon Square's Christmas opening times</a> also confirmed.</p>
