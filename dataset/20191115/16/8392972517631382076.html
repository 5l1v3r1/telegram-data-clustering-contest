      <p>Some reports suggest that Evelyn is the one who has broken the law again...</p>
      <p>Viewers know that Evelyn is no stranger to the police, after she was arrested in France during a period away from Weatherfield.</p>
      <p>Luckily her long lost grandson Tyrone was around to bail her out, bringing her back to the Street for some more savage putdowns and witticisms.</p>

      <p>Evelyn seems to be the only one who is wise to newcomer Jade's suspicious behaviour.</p>
      <p>Could Jade be the reason the family are in court?</p>
      <p>Viewers have spotted several clues that Jade isn't all she seems and future episodes reveal more strange behaviour from her.</p>
      <p>The family recently welcomed Jade into the household to care for Fiz's daughter Hope and Tyrone's daughter Ruby.</p>
      <p>But fans think she is a relative of Fiz's late husband John Stape, who turned into a serial killer before his own death in 2011.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Ever since she was introduced as Hope Stape's tutor, fans have been suspicious that something wasn't right.</p>
      <p>Some believe she's John Stape's sister. John was Hope's biological dad before he turned killer and then passed away himself in a car accident.</p>

      <p>Another theory is Jade could be John's eldest daughter, but some viewers believe she's actually connected to Tyrone and is the sister of his abusive ex, Kirsty Soames.</p>
      <p>There's also the thinking that Jade just wants to take Fiz's life over and have a ready made family.</p>
