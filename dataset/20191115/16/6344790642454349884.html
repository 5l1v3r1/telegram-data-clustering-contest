      <h1>Daisy Ridley Talks About STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER and Says It's "Dark, Scary, Sad, and Joyful"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joey Paur</a></address>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/14/daisy-ridley-rise-of-skywalker-dark-scary/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, <b>Daisy Ridley </b>opened up a bit and talked about <b><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></b>. The expectations are high for this movie and fans have been wondering if <b>J.J. Abrams</b> will actually be able to pull off a great ending for such an iconic story. The pressure is on and you can bet that he’s feeling it.</p>
      <p>In this new interview, Ridley teased what we can expect from the film in terms of the emotions we will feel while watching it. When asked about the movie, she said:</p>
      <blockquote>"Definitely dark. There are bits that are genuinely scary. And sad. And joyful… Dark, scary, sad, joyful — there you have it.”</blockquote>
      <p>She then went on to expand on Rey’s relationship with Kylo Ren, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>"What's fun what's been teased so far has confounded the fans. Because when I'm in the desert, is he in the TIE? What's going on? Am I running away? Am I running toward? In the fight, we're fighting each other, it's I think a very satisfying story. Because also leaving [<i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i>], I was like, 'I guess we've sort of mined that relationship.' No no, we've mined it some more."</blockquote>
      <p>I am curious to see what becomes of the relationship between Kylo and Rey. I just hope that Abrams delivers something completely unexpected that blows the fans away. As for what Abrams thinks about endings, he says:</p>
      <blockquote>“Endings are the thing that scare me the most. This is about bringing this thing to a close in a way that is emotional and meaningful and also satisfying in terms of actually answering [as many] questions as possible. So if years from now, someone’s watching these movies, all nine of them, they’re watching a story that is as cohesive as possible.”</blockquote>
      <p>We’ll just have to wait and see if he is able to actually pull it off.</p>
