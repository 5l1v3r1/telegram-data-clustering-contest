      <h1>KPL match-fixing scam: Lookout Circular against former owner of Ballari Tuskers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:26:44+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The Central Crime Branch (CCB) on Friday issued a Lookout Circular (LOC) against Arvind Venkatesha Reddy, the former owner of Ballari Tuskers who is suspected to have fled abroad.</p>
      <p>“We have specific information and corroborative evidence that he was involved in fixing matches in the 2018 tournament,” a senior officer said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Reddy, who got wind of the police moving in to arrest him, reportedly fled to Dubai recently. “Since, he is abroad, a notice has been served on him to appear for investigation and an LOC has been issued,” said a senior CCB official. All airports in the country have been alerted.</p>
      <p>He is the second KPL team owner to be under the scanner in the match-fixing scandal. Ashfaq Ali Thara, the owner of Belagavi Panthers, was arrested in September.</p>
      <p>Mr. Reddy, a businessman from Bengaluru, owned the Ballari Tuskers till 2018; it is now owned by his sister and relatives.</p>
      <p>He was earlier questioned by the CCB but let off as the police did not have any specific information about his involvement. However, the recent arrest of Ranji cricket players C.M. Gautam and Abrar Kazi shed new light on his role in the scandal, a police officer said.</p>
      <p>Several other players were recently questioned by the CCB, including K.C. Cariappa who played with the Indian Premier League team Kolkata Knight Riders and with Bijapur Bulls in KPL.</p>
      <p>However, a senior CCB officer said he was only one of many players questioned and arrests were made only if there was credible evidence against the player. In this case, the player was let off.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, Mr. Reddy had been arrested by the city police in August 2018 for allegedly assaulting policemen who went to a check a club he owned in Kundalahalli after there were complaints of loud music coming from there late at night.</p>
