      <h1>Border Patrol Agent Shoots Russian Man Over Alleged Illegal Border Crossing in Arizona</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:16:18+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>(LUKEVILLE, Ariz.) â€” The <a href="https://time.com/5695302/border-patrol-migrants-southern-border/">U.S. Border Patrol</a> says an agent shot and wounded a Russian man suspected of <a href="https://time.com/longform/migrants/">crossing the border</a> illegally in Arizona. The agency said Friday that the man was flown to a Phoenix hospital and is expected to survive.</p>
      <p>The Border Patrol says the unidentified agent attempted to arrest the man Thursday just east of the border town Lukeville.</p>
      <p>Authorities say a physical altercation followed and the agent shot the man. The agent was not seriously injured.</p>
      <p>The Border Patrol has faced criticism over its use of force in the past, but the number of shootings has fallen over the past few years.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, an agent shot and killed a gunman who opened fire near Sunland Park, New Mexico.</p>
