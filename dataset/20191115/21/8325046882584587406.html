      <p>James Charles is taking his YouTube career to the next level.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the YouTuber uploaded a video to his channel titled <a href="https://youtu.be/N_NWIKya_Qc">“Do YOU Have What It Takes To Be An Influencer?,”</a> in which he announced that he’ll soon be hosting, directing, and executive-producing a limited series for YouTube Originals.</p>
      <p>The show will focus on six micro-influencers as they participate in challenges that test “not only their makeup skills, but everything that it takes to be an influencer,” according to his video.</p>

      <p>“Beauty is such a major industry, and I’ve been lucky enough to grow a huge platform, but now I want to give back and share the knowledge I’ve gathered with others,” Charles said in a press release sent to Insider.</p>
      <p>“Being a superstar influencer takes a whole lot more than just blending eyeshadow, and I can’t wait to find out who has what it takes to make it to the top,” he said. “Producing my own show for YouTube is going to be a crazy challenge but I’m so ready – and hopefully the beauty community is too.”</p>
      <h3>According to James Charles, he’s been developing this series for more than three years</h3>
      <p>In his announcement video, Charles said creating a makeup competition show has been one of his “biggest goals” since starting his career.</p>
      <p>“Three years ago when I first moved to LA, I remember spending one morning sitting in my downtown apartment, and creating a full Notes-app document on my phone planning out a full concept for a makeup competition show,” Charles said.</p>
      <p>“I came up with the name, the description, literally every single challenge that I wanted these contestants to go through, literally guest judges as well – I was fully ready to go at this point – but I had never produced anything like that before,” he continued. “I barely even knew how to use my camera and my lights at the time.”</p>
      <h3>Charles is partnering with two companies to create his show</h3>
      <p>The competition show will be created with the help of Brian Graden Media and YouTube Originals.</p>
      <p>“James Charles is a leader in the industry when it comes to pushing boundaries with creative content,” Susanne Daniels, Global Head of Original Content for YouTube, said in a press release. “We are thrilled that James is bringing his energy and talent to our YouTube Originals slate with our first beauty competition series.”</p>
      <p>The show is set to begin streaming in Spring 2020 and will be available for free.</p>
      <p>“It is a limited series, and it is the first-ever beauty and social-media influencer competition of its kind ever,” Charles said in his video. “It’s going to be massive, and it’s going to be posted right here on YouTube.com/JamesCharles.”</p>

      <h3>You can now enter to participate in the show, though you must be a micro-influencer who’s at least 18 years old</h3>
      <p>Charles’ competition is open only to legal residents of the United States. Those who enter must also be at least 18 years old and have an active YouTube channel. The deadline to enter is November 21 at midnight.</p>
      <p>In order to enter, hopeful participants must share a 5-minute-long YouTube video in the style of a <a href="https://youtu.be/k_HoBSb-03A">Chit-Chat Get Ready With Me</a>. It should be titled “James Charles Casting Call,” and include the hashtag #JamesCharlesCasting. You must also fill out <a href="http://jamescharlescasting.com/">a form</a> on the YouTuber’s website to enter.</p>
      <p>Six micro-influencers will eventually be chosen to compete in Charles’ competition. Participants will then be flown to Los Angeles, where one winner will take home the grand prize of $50,000. Additional prizes will also be included, though Charles has not yet announced them.</p>
      <h3>Charles has been hinting at some behind-the-scenes news on Twitter</h3>
      <p>When Norvina, the president of Anastasia Beverly Hills, congratulated Charles on his upcoming show, the YouTuber hinted at the judges who will also appear on screen.</p>

      <p>He also hinted at a second season, which could potentially take place with international contestants.</p>

      <p>However, not all reactions have been positive. Some fans accused Charles of trying to take the spotlight away from Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star, who recently launched one of the <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-shane-dawson-makeup-where-to-buy-2019-11">biggest makeup collections of the year</a>.</p>

      <p>Charles, however, responded to the claims, and called the Twitter users “delusional.”</p>
