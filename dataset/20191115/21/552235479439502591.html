      <h2>Reports suggested the taxman had overcharged Rangers by £50million but HMRC have denied the claims.</h2>

      <p>HMRC being sued by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> over their collapse in 2012 is "fantasy stuff", according to a tax expert.</p>
      <p>A report in <i>The Times</i> on Thursday suggested HMRC had overcharged Rangers by £50million over the EBT scandal.</p>
      <p>It suggested they should have only been charged £20m for the use of EBTs between 2001 and 2010, but HMRC have taken the rare decision to comment on the allegation, who don't normally respond or make comments, but have made an exception for this case.</p>
      <p>They said: "As widely reported today and to clarify: HMRC won against Rangers’ tax avoidance in the Supreme Court, and did not miscalculate anything."</p>
      <p>However, tax barrister Jo Maugham QC insists there is little chance of success.</p>
      <p>The tax expert has played a key role in bringing to court a number of legal challenges to the Brexit process.</p>

      <p>He previously spoke to <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>about Rangers tax judgement.</p>
      <p>And now Maugham says Rangers suing HMRC is "wildly unlikely".</p>
      <p>He told the PA news agency: "HMRC are no longer contending that it is appropriate to apply a penalty and that's pretty much it.</p>
      <p>"I've not see anything that suggests HMRC has done anything wrong.</p>
      <p>"It's wildly unlikely (that HMRC could be sued over the events which led to the collapse of Rangers) I would say.</p>
      <p>"I'm a QC who specialises in tax. I'm a litigator in the tax sphere, so I see all this stuff routinely all the time.</p>
      <p>"It would take an absolutely remarkable set of facts before HMRC could be sued for getting the numbers wrong.</p>
      <p>"And there is nothing remotely justifying anything like that which I have seen.</p>
      <p>"It's a million miles away from that. It's fantasy stuff."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The report stemmed from a June audit by liquidators BDO, who wiped £26million off the amount claimed by HMRC after challenging the imposition of a £24m penalty for the use of an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) scheme, through which the club paid wages and bonuses which were disguised as loans.</p>
      <p>The reduction left the total outstanding to HMRC as £68m and there were claims on Thursday that the figure could drop by a total of £50m.</p>
      <p>This led to former Rangers chairman John McLelland arguing there would have been more potential buyers for the club had demands been reduced at the time.</p>
      <p>With the EBT case hanging over the club, Rangers were sold to Craig Whyte for £1 in May 2011 on the understanding he paid off their £18million bank debt and another tax bill of less than £3m.</p>
      <p>He mortgaged season ticket sales to pay the bank and the club went into administration in February 2012 over a separate tax debt relating to unpaid PAYE and national insurance.</p>

      <p>HMRC went on to win a legal challenge against the liquidated Rangers (now called RFC 2012 plc) over their use of EBTs, a test case which has allowed it to issue demands over the use of many other similar schemes.</p>
      <p>The tax authority would have had to instigate fresh legal action to enforce the £24m penalties - but with little money in the pot for creditors, it did not challenge BDO's assertion.</p>
      <p>A Rangers spokesman said: "The Times story, if it is shown to be accurate, throws up a great many questions and is a cause for concern.</p>
      <p>"Rangers will take time to consider any courses of action which may become feasible."</p>
