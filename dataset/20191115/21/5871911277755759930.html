      <h1>MLB rumors indicate Phillies interested in Madison Bumgarner</h1>

      <p>After failing to upgrade their starting rotation last offseason, the Philadelphia Phillies will be one of the more active teams seeking starting pitching in free agency this offseason.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/phillies/phillies-general-manager-meetings-gerrit-cole-scott-boras-20191110.html">Matt Breen of the Philadelphia Inquirer reported</a> that the Phillies have superstar pitcher Gerrit Cole atop of their wish list.</p>
      <p>Over the last two seasons, the 28-year-old Cole has been one of the best pitchers in baseball and <a href="https://theathletic.com/1329837">could reportedly receive the first-ever $300 million contract for a pitcher</a>.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, the Phillies will be competing with a lot of teams for his services. However, Phils general manager Matt Klentak is still putting out feelers to other free-agent pitchers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1374691/2019/11/13/rosenthal-qualifying-offer-thoughts-contemplating-yelichs-future-in-milwaukee-hamels-is-the-new-happ-more-notes/">According to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic</a>, the Phillies have “checked in” on <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bumgama01.shtml">Madison Bumgarner</a>. In addition to the Phillies, the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves have also expressed interest.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/1195099863219888135">ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported</a> that Bumgarner declined the San Francisco Giants’ one-year, $17.8 million qualifying offer. This means any team who wants to sign him will have to give up a draft pick and international bonus pool money.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Klentak expressed his concerned about giving up a draft pick for a free agent. But with the team’s starting rotation in dire straights, adding Bumgarner would be worth the risk.</p>
      <p>Over his 11-year career, the four-time All-star pitcher has an ERA of 3.13 and an impressive 2.11 ERA in the postseason.</p>
      <p>In 34 starts last season for the Giants, Bumgarner posted a 9-9 record with an ERA of 3.90 (career-high), along with 203 strikeouts in 207.2 innings pitched.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, this is not the first time we’ve heard the Phillies being connected to Bumgarner. Last offseason, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/sources-giants-open-to-bumgarner-talks/c-301133404?tid=282421090">Jon Morosi of MLB.com reported</a> that the Phillies were one of the teams interested in trading for the veteran ace pitcher.</p>
      <p>If the Phillies were to add a pitcher of Bumgarner’s caliber, it would help solidify the top of their starting rotation.</p>
      <p>Between 2013-16, the former first-round pick was one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball, racking 64 wins with an ERA of 2.86 and averaging 226 strikeouts per season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/san-francisco-giants/madison-bumgarner-7510/market-value/">According to Spotrac.com</a>, Bumgarner’s calculated market value is a five-year deal worth $105 million, with an average annual salary of $21.1 million.</p>
      <p>Would the Phillies be willing to dish out that type of money, especially with the Jake Arrieta deal looking like a complete failure? It is tough to say.</p>
      <p>However, what we do know is the Phillies must come away with at least two starting pitchers in free agency to make this offseason a success.</p>
