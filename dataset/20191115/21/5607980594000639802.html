      <h1>HTC Desire 19s is an inexpensive triple-camera smartphone</h1>

      <p>Despite selling much of its smartphone team to Google a few years ago, Taiwanese device maker HTC has continued building phones… particularly weird ones like the <a href="https://www.htcexodus.com/eu/">HTC Exodus</a> line of blockchain smartphones.</p>
      <p>The new <a href="https://www.htc.com/tw/smartphones/htc-desire-19s/"><b>HTC Desire 19s</b></a> is little less weird… unless you consider the fact that HTC is still in the phone business to be weird.</p>
      <p>It’s a relatively cheap phone with a set of features that used to be reserved for flagships including a waterdrop-style notch, a 3-camera setup on the back of the phone, NFC, and a fingerprint sensor.</p>
      <p>The Desire 19s is available in Taiwan for just under $200. There’s no word in or or when you’ll be able to pick one up in other regions.</p>

      <p>The phone doesn’t have as much memory or storage as most modern flagships, but it does have a microSD card reader for removable storage. And it has a fairly large battery.</p>

      <p>HTC may not be in the flagship phone business anymore. But there’s something nice about knowing that the company that built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axim_X50_series">my favorite PDA</a> 15 years ago is still in the mobile space.</p>
