      <p>The children and teenagers - aged between 10 and 17 - gathered in the Dáil chamber today as part of the youth assembly on climate.</p>
      <p>In the sitting overseen by Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl, the assembly put forward a range of ideas - with members saying that the response to the crisis so far hasn't been good enough.</p>

      <p>The Taoiseach says he's confident that Fine Gael conducted itself properly in the deselection of Maria Bailey.</p>
      <p>The TD at the centre of the 'swing-gate' controversy claims to have serious concerns about the procedures of a meeting last month where local party members in Dun Laoghaire called for the election ticket to be changed.</p>
      <p>After she was formally dropped by Fine Gael last night, Deputy Bailey said she had hoped to rebuild her reputation and move on.</p>

      <p>The Government is hoping to sign the contract for the National Broadband Plan in the 'next couple of weeks', according to Leo Varadkar.</p>
      <p>It comes after the European Commission gave the green light to the plan.</p>
      <p>Their decision paves the way for the Government to sign contracts with its preferred bidder for the project, Granahan McCourt.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The head of the KBC Group has apologised for 'insensitive' comments he made yesterday about the tracker mortgage scandal.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, CEO Johan Thijs described the measures the Central Bank has taken against lenders as a result of the scandal as "annoying".</p>
      <p>Mr Thijs called on the regulator to move on, and insisted the Belgium-based group had learned from its mistakes.</p>
      <p>The remarks prompted a reaction from the Taoiseach earlier, who said the best way for the bank to move on was for them to "deal with" the scandal.</p>
