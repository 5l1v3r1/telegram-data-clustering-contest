      <p>A food safety warning has been issued after 20 tonnes of salmon went missing following a lorry crash.</p>
      <p>The fish disappeared after the lorry overturned on the A82 near the Bridge of Orchy on Monday.</p>
      <p>Argyll and Bute Council is now warning people not to eat or buy any salmon from unknown sources amid fears the missing fish may have entered the food supply chain.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has any of the salmon is advised to dispose of it.</p>
      <p>The council said in a statement: "It is potentially unsafe to eat and should not be consumed.</p>
      <p>"At the time of the accident the salmon was head on and gutted and of various sizes. It had not undergone processing.</p>
      <p>"This salmon cannot under any circumstances be used for further processing because of potential food safety issues and also because it does not comply with the requirements of food law.</p>
      <p>"If you are in possession of this salmon you are advised to dispose of it immediately.</p>
      <p>"Members of the public are advised that legitimate salmon, that complies with the requirements of food law, will be sold through reputable retail and wholesale outlets."</p>
      <p>Anyone with concerns is asked to call Argyll and Bute Council on 01546 605 519.</p>
