      <p>U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, as positive comments related to the U.S.-China trade talks and strong earnings from semiconductor industry bellwether Applied Materials put the S&amp;P 500 and Dow on track to hit fresh highs.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Wall Street's main indexes hit fresh record highs on Friday, as optimism related to U.S.-China trade talks and solid earnings from semiconductor industry bellwether Applied Materials brightened sentiment.</p>
      <p>Shares in Applied Materials Inc jumped 9.29per cent and pushed the Philadelphia Semiconductor index to an all-time high after the chip gear maker forecast first-quarter results above estimates.</p>

      <p>Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were higher. The trade-sensitive technology sector rose 0.77per cent, providing the biggest boost.</p>
      <p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Thursday that the world's two largest economies were getting close to a trade agreement, citing what he called very constructive talks with Beijing.</p>
      <p>Adding to the upbeat mood, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said there would be a call between U.S. and Chinese officials later on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We are definitely headed in the right direction with regard to trade," said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GlobAlt in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>"Although there was some skittishness ... the equity market hasn't shown much of a pull back and we are still making those highs."</p>
      <p>Wall Street's main indexes have been powered recently by hopes of a trade deal, largely better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was on course to post its sixth weekly percentage rise.</p>
      <p>Data showed U.S. retail sales rebounded in October, but consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items and clothing, which could temper expectations for a strong holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>The report comes a day after the benchmark S&amp;P hit an all-time closing high after retail giant Walmart Inc's robust earnings.</p>
      <p>At 11:29 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 155.78 points, or 0.56per cent, at 27,937.74, the S&amp;P 500 was up 18.44 points, or 0.60per cent, at 3,115.07 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 55.36 points, or 0.65per cent, at 8,534.38.</p>
      <p>Qualcomm Inc gained 2per cent after Mizuho upgraded its rating on the stock to "buy" from "neutral".</p>
      <p>But Nvidia Corp fell 1.7per cent as the company said it expects its gaming chip business to be impacted by seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.92-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.64-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P index recorded 42 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 87 new highs and 79 new lows.</p>
