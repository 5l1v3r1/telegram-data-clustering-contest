      <h1>New York Jets Announce Le’Veon Bell’s Status For This Weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:50:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>This season hasn’t gone as well as Le’Veon Bell hoped it would, but the All-Pro running back still has time to improve his production. On Sunday, the New York Jets will face the Washington Redskins on the road.</p>
      <p>New York is coming off its second victory of the season. Despite all the fans calling for the team to fire head coach Adam Gase, management has already said they won’t make any changes to the coaching staff.</p>
      <p>Obviously this year has been an utter disappointment for the Jets. However, the upcoming schedule for the AFC East squad is pretty favorable.</p>
      <p>It also helps that New York should have its top offensive playmaker healthy for this Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Jets revealed their final injury report for Week 11. Bell is listed as questionable due to an illness.</p>
      <p>Fans won’t have to worry about the injury designation for Bell as he went on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/LeVeonBell/status/1195410319180328961?s=20">basically announce that he’ll be playing</a>.</p>

      <p>Bell has just 449 rushing yards through the first 10 weeks of the season, which would put him on pace for his least productive season since 2015 – when he only played six games due to an injury.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Bell, the Redskins have the 28th-ranked rushing defense in the NFL. He should have plenty of opportunities to find the end zone on Sunday.</p>
