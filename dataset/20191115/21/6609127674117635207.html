      <p>But the Celtic-daft superstar, who spoke out against a Yes vote in 2014 along with other British celebs, insisted he was passionate about the Union.</p>
      <p>Sir Rod, who was born in London to a Scots dad and English mum, told BBC Scotland’s The Nine show: “I’m somewhat of a traditionalist.</p>
      <p>“It would be a shame to see the British Isles break up. It would be a shame to see that blue off the Union Jack. But if it is good for Scotland then I’m happy.”</p>
      <p>Ahead of the first indy poll five years ago, Sir Rod said of Scotland: “It’s always been a spiritual home but as I don’t live there I shouldn’t comment on independence.</p>
      <p>"I hope it’s not a lot of kids thinking ‘Braveheart’.”</p>
      <p>In The Nine interview Sir Rod also claimed he had faith in PM Boris Johnson to end the Brexit deadlock.</p>
      <p>He said: “We’re in a muddle but I think Boris will sort it out. We have to be patient.</p>
      <p>“I was always a Remainer. I didn’t see why we had to leave.</p>
      <p>“Maybe it’s something that I’m missing, I don’t know, but I’m still a Remainer.”</p>
      <p>And the music legend insisted December 12’s General Election is of the “utmost importance”.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s a once in a lifetime, this election. I don’t know what the outcome is going to be, I really don’t.”</p>
