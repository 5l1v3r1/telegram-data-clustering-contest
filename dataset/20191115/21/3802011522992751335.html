      <p>He attributed the rise of his game to the competition he has to contend with week-in-week-out in the tough English Premier League, but was not entirely pleased with the result though he refused to press panic buttons as yet.</p>
      <p>“I have learnt a lot at Villa, the competition in that league is very stiff so as a player you have to be continuously improving to match the competition.</p>
      <p>“Today I was doing some of the things we are taught at the club but it is not about me but the team as a whole.</p>
      <p>“Coach (Joey) Antipas gave me important tips for this game and as players our job is to implement that.</p>
      <p>“We have a game on Tuesday (against Zambia), we just need to push each other and hope for a good result away from home.</p>
      <p>“We wanted a win today but I do not think a draw is a disaster though,” Nakamba said after the match.</p>
      <p>The Villa defensive linkman was at his inspirational best for his country but his international teammates could not complement his good efforts at the heart of midfield.</p>
      <p>Deployed in front of the back four to initiate the team’s attack and protect the back four, he did that with distinction.</p>
      <p>Nakamba picked up loose balls but those he played with failed to give him return balls.</p>
      <p>He had quickly settled into the match giving his international teammates the much-needed midfield pivot to build on their attacks.</p>
      <p>As early as the fourth minute he threaded a pass to his captain Knowledge Musona but the latter is struggling with his game and could not lead a meaningful attack.</p>
      <p>The crowd was on its toes enjoying the quick passing of the England-based star who was always accurate and excellent on his ball retention.</p>
      <p>But as the game grew he started showing his teammates what to do with and without the ball, making playing football look very easy.</p>
      <p>He is willing to pass words of wisdom to his teammates.</p>
      <p>“We are always pushing each other so that we can improve on our game and help our country achieve great things.</p>
      <p>“We were not bad and I do not think there is need to panic we just need to regroup and focus on Tuesday’s game.</p>
      <p>“It is unfortunate we did not win at home and the supporters are understandably not happy but it is still very early to complain about anything we have time to recover.</p>
      <p>“We still remain very confident,” said Nakamba. <b>The Herald</b></p>
