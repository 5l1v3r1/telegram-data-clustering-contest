      <h1>What Can Superman &amp; Lois Learn From Past Superman Shows and Movies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:11:57+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author">Timothy Donohoo</a></address>
      <p>The CW's upcoming <a href="https://www.cbr.com/superman-lois-the-cw-developing-series-with-hoechlin-tulloch/"><i>Superman and Lois </i>series</a> will be the first of two new additions to the Arrowverse after "Crisis On Infinite Earths<i>." </i>It won't, however, be the network's first Superman-related show but rather the latest in a long line of live-action depictions of the Man of Steel.</p>
      <p>Many of these have given different takes on Kal-El for different eras, and all had their own strengths and weaknesses. <i>Superman &amp; Lois </i>could take what worked from all of these predecessors, as well as avoid their various pitfalls. If it aims to please existing fans of the character while structuring the mythos to appeal to those apprehensive of Superman, the series could become the definitive take on the Last Son of Krypton in modern pop culture.</p>

      <h3>Villains</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/superman-villains-underrated/">Superman's very underrated host of villains</a> have been given a less than satisfactory run in live-action, with the only members of his rogues gallery that typically get any shine being Lex Luthor and General Zod. The Donnerverse Superman used these villains while also making up its own lackluster additions. The DCEU also fell back upon these two, while also using Doomsday. <i>Smallville </i>featured many of Superman's villains, but, to fit in with the show's unnecessarily grounded tone, these villains were typically as plainclothes and mundane as Clark.</p>
      <p>That said, <i>Superman &amp; Lois </i>would do well to introduce its own version of less utilized Superman foes. <i>Supergirl </i>already introduced Zod, Luthor, Metallo and a few others, but there's still ample room to use the many otherwise untouched enemies. Introducing villains such as Bruno Mannheim, Prankster, Parasite, Mongul and, of course, Brainiac, as well as portraying them in all of their glory would instantly set <i>Superman &amp; Lois </i>apart from previous adaptations that failed to give them their due.</p>

      <h3>Superfamily Man</h3>

      <p>The show will already possibly involve Lois and Clark's Super Son, Jon Samuel Kent, making the Super Family a literal concept, along with cousin Supergirl. This would be the DC Rebirth character's first live-action appearance and it would also be the fulfillment of DC's greatest couple as parents, something hinted at but not shown in <i>Lois and Clark </i>before that show ended. For supporting characters, however, the show could also use members of the Superman Family from the comics that haven't been used as much in live-action. These include the most popular modern Superboy, Superman's clone Kon-El, as well as armor-clad scientist John Henry Irons, aka Steel. These characters have both been used in live-action before, but never have they had a working relationship with Superman himself. Superboy's role in <i>Smallville </i>was brief, with his appearance in <i>Titans </i>so far excluding Superman. Meanwhile, the much-maligned <i>Steel </i>movie excised Superman entirely, and having the character on this show would be a chance to redeem him in live-action.</p>
      <p>Other Superman supporting cast members that could be given focus are mainstays such as Perry White, as well as Steve Lombard, Ron Troupe, Bibbo Bibowski, Lana Lang and Professor Emil Hamilton. There may even be room for more secondary and recent characters, such as Gangbuster, Shay Veritas and Chloe Sullivan. This would help to define these very important characters that, sadly, aren't nearly as iconic in the modern era as supporting characters of the Batman mythology.</p>

      <h3>A Symbol for Hope</h3>

      <p>One of the biggest complaints concerning the vastly different portrayal of Superman in the DCEU was how dark and pessimistic that version was. Even when the films attempted to look up to him, the reverence was considerably moodier than previous adaptations. Thus, those wanting a modern, yet traditional definitive take on Superman were left sorely wanting. His portrayal on this show should give him the hopeful icon persona that was sorely missing in the recent movies and never shown in the previous Superman-related TV series.</p>
      <p><i>Superman &amp; Lois </i>could easily contrast with darker shows like <i>Batwoman </i>and the soon ending <i>Arrow, </i>much in the same way that <i>The Flash </i>does. In doing so, the full character of Superman is able to be shown in an accurate way, while still making him appealing for modern audiences and not "cheesy" like past versions. This is a thin line that the show would have to skirt, though -- one that previous adaptations didn't. The Donnerverse movies and arguably <i>Lois and Clark </i>followed the more Pollyanna portrayal of the character, perhaps to their detriment in modern eyes. <i>Smallville </i>didn't <i>truly </i>give viewers Superman himself, thus dancing around the issue. Conversely, the DCEU went too far in the opposite direction in an attempt to draw in audiences that were usually uninterested in the character. <i>Superman &amp; Lois </i>should and must wear its DNA on its sleeve, but in a way that both pleases the fans and gains new ones.</p>

      <h3>Weight of the World</h3>
      <p>One way to have the audience relate more to Superman, while still portraying his various superheroic acts, would be to show how taxing the job is on him mentally. The series is already described as showing the couple's stress and pressures, so showing the mental fortitude needed to be faster than a speeding bullet for the world's problems would fit right in. This would allow the awesome power of Superman to remain intact while adding a layer of pathos that would keep him from being seen as an "unrelatable god."</p>
      <p>Having the time offered in a syndicated television series would also allow more philosophical questions regarding Superman's role in the world to be given their proper space. One of the biggest issues with these elements in the DCEU was the relative lack of time to flesh out such ideas against all of the other plots going on. Having far more than two and a half hours to develop the characters, <i>Superman &amp; Lois </i>would have the chance to fully peel back all of its protagonist's layers. In doing so, it could give fans of all ages and versions of the character a true Superman for all seasons.</p>
      <p>The CW's <i>Superman &amp; Lois</i> stars Tyler Hoechlin and Elizabeth Tulloch. The new <i>Arrow</i>verse series is expected to debut during the 2020-21 TV season.</p>
