      <h1>NYT: Trump admin set to extend Huawei license again</h1>
      <h2>Without an extension, the temporary license will expire after Monday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:23:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>In May, the US Commerce Department <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/15/president-trump-national-emergency-for-telecom-networks/">added Huawei to the "Entity List,"</a> banning US companies from doing business with it unless they have a special license. Since then it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/20/huawei-temp-license/">extended temporary licenses</a> for existing customers, like mobile phone users and rural telecoms that use its equipment. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/19/huawei-90-day-temporary-license/">most recent extension</a> is set to expire next week, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/business/us-reprieve-huawei.html"><i>New York Times</i></a> reports the Trump administration is set to extend it a third time, for a length of time that is unknown.</p>
      <p>This deadline is arriving against the backdrop of negotiation over trade between the US and Chinese government, and the report also indicates that the administration is considering "product specific" licenses that would allow some companies to keep supplying Huawei.</p>
