      <h2>Jofra Archer claimed two wickets against New Zealand A on Friday with his electric pace causing plenty of issues for the batsmen and bowling coach Darren Gough praised him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:07:51+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:07</time> by <a rel="author">Dean Wilson, https://www.facebook.com/DeanWilsonCricketMirror/</a></address>
      <p>England have been told to ‘find a way’ of taking wickets on flat pitches with Jofra Archer as their new strike weapon.</p>
      <p>The expectations on his shoulders have been so heavy from the moment he first pulled on an ­England shirt – and his performances over the summer have done ­nothing to dampen the vibe.</p>
      <p>So here in New Zealand on his first overseas assignment and with just four Tests under his belt, he is the X-Factor that England are looking towards to cut a swathe through the Kiwi line-up.</p>
      <p>And after watching him rough up the Kiwi ‘A’ ­batsmen as they made 302-6 declared thanks to a Glenn Phillips hundred, bowling consultant Darren Gough is in no doubt of Archer’s value.</p>

      <p>“You need a strike bowler and the third spell was the best he’s bowled since he’s been here,” said Gough. “The pitch is flat, not doing anything ­sideways or through the air, and as a captain or a coach you’re looking for a bowler to do something – and Jofra has done that.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy but you find a way to attack, even on flat pitches and this is the best prep you can get, because there’s a good chance next week could be similar to this.</p>
      <p>“Archer is just a ­natural talent,” added Gough. “It’s about keep challenging him and giving him a target.</p>
      <p>“I say ok, you bowl at 95mph and Tim Southee and Trent Boult bowl at 85. They somehow find a way on flat pitches to take wickets in New Zealand. So what do they think?</p>

      <p>“If you need control, you go to Broad. If you need a wicket, you go to Archer.”</p>
      <p>The latter claimed 2-58 from his 17 overs, but had the impact of providing wickets for others.</p>
      <p>Ben Stokes picked up Tim Seifert and Jimmy ­Neesham following a ­hostile Archer spell in which he struck Phillips on the arm and body, and ­regularly put him on the floor. “My goodness that was the quickest I’ve ever faced in my life, jeez,” said <br/>Phillips following his 116. “He hit my forearm, nearly took my head off a couple of times and got me in the chest a couple of times.</p>
      <p>“I’ve played against him before for the MCC Young Cricketers when he was playing for Sussex Second XI and he was all over me back then too.</p>
      <p>“The challenge was ­unbelievable and it was the most fun you can have out there. With Steve Smith getting hit a couple of months ago, it is in the back of your mind as he’s running in but it is a tactic and if you’re watching the ball you’ll be alright.”</p>
      <p>The only real concern on the day came when Joe Root (below) jarred his hip when trying to stop a boundary and ­hobbled off with pins and needles, ­unable to feel his left foot.</p>
      <p>Thankfully he was back on the field soon after to allay any fears, but there was less joy for Rory Burns who fell in the penultimate over of the day for 14 ­cutting straight to point.</p>
