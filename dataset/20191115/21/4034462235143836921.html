      <h1>Aston Martin Shows Awesome Aviation-Inspired Special Editions</h1>
      <h2>And more are coming.</h2>

      <p>Aston Martin is a company with a rich connection to aviation. Three of its four UK manufacturing sites are located on former Royal Air Force bases and the company's <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/you-won-t-believe-how-much-care-goes-into-making-an-aston-martin-badge">logo is made up of a pair of wings</a>. Hence why Aston's Q Division has released a series of special edition cars with RAF-inspired themes. One example was the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/aston-martin-s-latest-special-edition-looks-ready-to-fly">V8 Vantage S Blades Edition</a>, which was named after a British aerobatics team. Only five copies were built.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/the-aston-martin-v12-vantage-s-just-got-better-with-a-fighter-plane-inspired-special-edition">V12 Vantage S Spitfire 80</a> was another great example, of which just 80 were built. If you bought one of the 80 cars, you also received a Spitfire 80 Irvin jacket, flying helmet, and goggles. To celebrate its connection with the RAF, the company has brought together all of its "Aston Martin Wings" vehicles for an impressive photoshoot.</p>

      <p>Along with the two RAF-inspired <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/vantage">Vantage</a> models, Aston Martin also gathered up examples of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/aston-martin-vanquish-s-red-arrows-edition-honors-acrobatic-airplanes">Vanquish S Red Arrows Edition</a>. Only 10 of these cars were built with just nine making it into customer's hands. The 10th car was auctioned off for charity, raising Â£1.46 million ($1.87 million) for the RAF Benevolent Fund.</p>
      <p>Judging by the photo of nine red cars with a corresponding number of Red Arrows Hawk airplanes flying above them, Aston was able to gather all of the cars for this historic photoshoot. The Red Arrows Edition Vanquish even uses switchgear made from the undercarriage leg of the airplane from which it gets its name.</p>

      <p>Aston Martin President and Group CEO, Andy Palmer, is even an Honorary Group Captain in the 601st Squadron of the Royal Air Force. "Aston Martin will always be synonymous with aviation, from our wings logo to the heritage of our manufacturing sites across the UK," Palmer said. "The Vanquish S Red Arrows edition was a great success for everyone concerned and I look forward to seeing our future aviation-related special editions."</p>
