      <p>FC Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi carried his scoring form into the international break as his solitary strike guided Argentina to victory Superclasico rivals Brazil on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>Messi returned from his three-month ban, among the five changes made by La Albiceleste manager Lionel Scaloni, while Selecao were without the injured Neymar and goalkeeper Ederson, with their manager Tite relying on the front trio of Roberto Firmino, Willian and Gabriel Jesus for inspiration.</p>
      <p>The game started with the drama of penalties after Brazil were awarded a spot-kick in the tenth minute after Jesus was brought down inside the box by Leandro Paredes. The Manchester City star stepped up to take the penalty but his shot hit the outside of the post.</p>
      <p>Argentina also had a penalty go their way two minutes later after Alex Sandro caught Messi from behind inside the box. The Barcelona superstar's spot-kick was initially saved by shot-stopper Alisson but he reacted tquickest to strike home from the rebound.</p>
      <p>Scaloni's troops had their tails up after that, playing with much confidence but neither could find clear opportunities, with the game getting physical in the closing phase of the first stanza.</p>
      <p>Brazil were under pressure early in the second stanza and they nearly went two goals down in the 68th minute after Messsi from distance, but Alisson tipped the effort over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Tite made a double change moments after that, with Richarlison and Rodrygo coming on for Jesus and Willian as the five-time world champions pushed for an equaliser.</p>
      <p>Alisson was the reason Selecao were still in the game in the closing stages after the Liverpool star pulled off another brilliant save with 14 minutes remaining to keep out Paredes' first-time volley that seemed destined for the top corner.</p>
      <p>La Albiceleste had the momentum in the closing minutes but were unable to their chances, with Alisson also playing a big role in keeping the score-line respectable for Brazil as Scaloni's charges claimed the narrow win in the end.</p>
