      <h1>Path of Exile 2 hits beta in “very late 2020”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:37:56+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:37</time> by <a rel="author">Dustin Bailey</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>Path of Exile 2 is official. The massive update formerly known as <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/path-of-exile/40-mega-expansion">Path of Exile 4.0</a> is now being branded as a full sequel, and it’ll have the content to match: a massive new campaign, loads of new equipment, new ascendancy classes, and a reworked skill gem system. The release is still a long way out, but developer Grinding Gear Games has already announced a load of details.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new, seven-act campaign is set 20 years after the death of Kitava, and will be available alongside PoE1 campaign – both storylines conclude into the same endgame content. PoE2 will include all the expansion content that’s come to the game over the years, while making engine improvements and adding a host of new features.</p>
      <p>The new set of exiles will get a new set of ascendancy classes to choose from – 19 options that are distinct from those from the PoE1 campaign. We’re also getting a reworked skill system, which will allow you to socket support gems directly into skill gems – which should make building your character easier, while maintaining all the previous depth.</p>
      <p>Naturally, there’s plenty of new equipment, and the devs say on the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/exilecon/one">official site</a> that “the entire progression of armour and weapons has been redone from start to finish.” (Of course, all your microtransaction purchases will carry over.)</p>

      <p>Path of Exile 2 does not yet have a release date, and you shouldn’t expect a beta until “at least very late 2020.” That’s about as far out as the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/diablo-4/release-date">Diablo 4 release date</a>, so it seems we’re getting ready for a true war of ARPG titans. Someday.</p>
