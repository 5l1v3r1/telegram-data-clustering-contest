      <p>Blachowicz (24-8) has won five of his last six, three of them finishes, including last July’s brutal knockout finish over middleweight import Luke Rockhold. The power-punching Pole stands at <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/12/20961468/latest-ufc-rankings-update-zabit-volkov-improve-following-victories-moscow-mma">No. 6</a> in the official rankings.</p>
      <p>As for Souza (26-7, 1 NC), he’s looking to rebound from a disappointing decision loss to Jack Hermansson last April. “Jacare” has struggled in recent years, putting together a 3-3 record as he nears his 40th birthday in December.</p>
