      <p>Bella Thorne says polyamory can be a really beautiful thing.</p>
      <p>Thorne, 22, shared the secret sauce to polyamory when speaking to <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29800901/bella-thorne-forbidden-flowers-interview-marijuana-polyamory/"><i>Cosmopolitan</i></a>. The “Midnight Sun” actress explained how important it is for all parties to be on the same page.</p>
      <p>“If you’re gonna date a guy and a girl at the same time, those people have to really f**k with each other,” she shared. “Or <i>literally</i> f**k with each other. You know what I’m saying? It’s like, it really depends on finding the right mesh of two people.”</p>

      <p>Thorne went on to share some examples of magical emotional connections you can form in a polyamorous relationship.</p>
      <p>“If it works, you can spend a weekend with two people and you’re all hanging out and having fun and smoking, and like, sharing stories up late at night,” she said. “Kind of having fun acting like children in that way. It’s a really fun experience.”</p>
      <p>“I have been able to capture that a couple times, and I just love that idea,” Thorne added. “I love loving two people at once. I love sharing stories with three people in one room. So, I’m always trying to find ways to make it work because I think it really would make me happy.”</p>

      <p>She admitted her partners are often caught off-guard when she brings up polyamory. Thorne said, however, their tune quickly changes.</p>
      <p>“A lot of my partners start out like ‘what?’ and I’m like, ‘Bro, this is who I am.’ So, you’re either down or you’re not down and I totally understand if you’re not down,” Thorne said. “At this point in my life, I want to find what makes me the happiest, and that is the mission I am on.”</p>
      <p>“A lot of people are actually down and it totally changes their mind. At first they’re like, <i>gasp</i>, ‘How do you even do that?'” she concluded. “And then we talk it through and they’re like, ‘Wow, that actually sounds kind of beautiful.'”</p>
      <p>Thorne is currently linked to Italian singer Benjamin Mascolo and an unknown female who has only appeared in her Instagram photos with her face covered.</p>
