      <h1>Oregon vs. Arizona: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:14:50+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>A month or two ago, it appeared the Pac-12 didn’t have a great shot to get into the College Football Playoff. But with two teams from the conference now ranked in <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/the-college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-11-have-been-released">the top seven in the latest rankings</a>, the possibility is growing stronger. One of those teams, Oregon, has a prime chance for a home win on Saturday with Arizona coming to Eugene.</p>
      <p>No. 6 Oregon has played phenomenally since the Ducks’ season opening loss to Auburn. Now, the Ducks are gearing up for what many expect to be a blowout game against the Arizona Wildcats.</p>
      <p>Justin Herbert leads the Oregon offense behind one of the best offensive lines in the nation. If Arizona has any chance of an upset on Saturday night, the Wildcats must find a way to get pressure on Herbert.</p>
      <p>Arizona needs two more wins to become bowl eligible. But the Wildcats have three very difficult games remaining against Oregon, Utah and Arizona State.</p>
      <p>Khalil Tate and Wildcats upset Oregon last year in a 44-15 victory in Tucson. Will they do the same on Saturday?</p>
