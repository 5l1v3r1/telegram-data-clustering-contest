      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> took to Twitter to bully an impeachment witness in real time as she testified about how she felt personally threatened by the president.</p>
      <p>Former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was attacked by the president midway through her testimony, which House Democrats are now calling a blatant example of witness intimidation.</p>
      <p>The president, who ordered Yovanovitch to be fired in May, said: ‘Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?</p>
      <p>‘Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.’</p>
      <p>‘They call it “serving at the pleasure of the President.” The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than proceeding administrations. It is called, quite simply, America First! With all of that, however, I have done FAR more for Ukraine than O (President Barack Obama).’</p>

      <p>During a brief pause in the hearing, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said: ‘What you saw today – witness intimidation in real time by the president of the Untied States.’</p>
      <p>‘Once again, going after this dedicated and respected career public servant in an effort to not only chill her but to chill others who may come forward. We take this kind of witness intimidation and obstruction of inquiry very seriously,’ He continued.</p>
      <p>Schiff asked Yovanovitch what she thought of the Tweets and she replied that they were ‘very intimidating.’</p>
      <p>Trump’s Tweets during the hearing were not derided solely by Democrats – even some prominent conservatives expressed their dissapproval.</p>
      <p>Ken Starr, a current Fox contributor who was chosen by Republicans to lead the impeachment investigation into Bill Clinton, said the president’s tweets showed ‘extraordinarily poor judgement,’</p>

      <p>‘The president frequently says, ‘I follow my instincts.’ Sometimes we have to control our instincts…So, obviously, this was I think quite injurious.’</p>
      <p>Some lawmakers speculated that Trump’s tweets may be used as more evidence in their articles of impeachment against Trump.</p>
      <p>At the center of the impeachment hearing is a phone call Donald Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where he urged the Ukrainian president to investigate his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who could challenge him in the 2020 presidential election.</p>

      <p>Trump is accused of using $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to leverage his request, which came after Trump claimed Biden called for the firing of a Ukranian prosecutor who was ‘investigating his son,’ Hunter Biden, over his business dealings with Ukranian natural gas firm Burisma.</p>
      <p>During the phone call, Trump told Zelenksy: ‘The former ambassador from the United States, the woman (Yovanovich), was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that.’</p>
      <p>‘She’s going to go through some things,’ Trump said, which Yovanovich said she perceived as a threat when she heard it after she was the victim of a smear campaign orchestrated by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.</p>
