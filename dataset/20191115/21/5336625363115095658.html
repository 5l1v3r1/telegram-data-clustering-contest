      <h1>Walmart vs. Target: Which One Really Has the Best Black Friday Deals?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:10:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:10</time> by <a rel="author">PCMag</a></address>
      <p>Walmart and Target are both slashing prices in the hopes that you'll spend your hard-earned <a href="https://bestblackfriday.com/">Black Friday</a> dollars with them this year. But we're not made of money; let's see which retailer has the best deals in some key categories.</p>
      <h3>When Do the Deals Start?</h3>
      <p>Walmart's official <a href="https://bestblackfriday.com/ads/walmart-black-friday">Black Friday event</a> begins online at 10 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Nov. 27 and in stores on Thanksgiving Day, beginning at 6 p.m. local time. For those who can't wait, Walmart.com has some <a href="https://zdcs.link/7y2Ey">"Buy Now" Black Friday deals</a> today, and more "Pre-Black Friday" deals on Nov. 22.</p>
      <p><a href="https://bestblackfriday.com/ads/target-black-friday">Target</a> will kick off its in-store event at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Stores will be open until 1 a.m. on Black Friday, Nov. 29, then reopen at 7 a.m. Of course, you can always skip the in-store hassle and shop online.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday TV Deals: Target vs. Walmart</h3>
      <p>Here in the US, you can usually score the best TV deals ahead of the Super Bowl, but if your living room is crying out for a new massive television, there will be a few deals on offer at Walmart and Target.</p>
      <p>At Walmart, you can nab a <a href="https://zdcs.link/w7qXq">65-inch Vizio 4K</a> set for $398, a $130 discount, as well as a 50-inch Walmart-brand Onn TV for $150.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://zdcs.link/2kP4D">50-inch</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/OKXR2">55-inch Samsung 4K set</a> will be $278 and $328, respectively, at Walmartâ€”both $50 discounts. Target will have the same Samsung 4K sets for $279.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/65qo7">50-inch</a>) and $329 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/p8eXl">55-inch</a>), so basically the same prices. In stores at Target, a 55-inch 4K Element Roku TV will be $279, though Samsung is usually better in terms of brand satisfaction.</p>
      <h3>Smart Speaker Deals: Target vs. Walmart</h3>
      <p>If you're looking to add a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/357520/the-best-smart-speakers">smart speaker</a> to your home this year, Target is the place to check for Amazon Echo discounts. It'll have the <a href="https://zdcs.link/3PkRw">third-gen Echo Dot</a> for $22 (down from $49.99), the <a href="https://zdcs.link/4BBdy?pageview=01gBRtfzTmHblYknXAMBUh0">Echo Show 5</a> for $49.99 (down from $89.99), and the third-gen <a href="https://zdcs.link/jVM4P">Amazon Echo</a> for $59.99 (down from $99.99).</p>
      <p>If you prefer the Google Assistant, Target will have the original <a href="https://zdcs.link/0ggZe?pageview=01gBRtfzTmHblYknXAMBUh0">Google Home</a> for $49 (currently $79) and the original <a href="https://zdcs.link/rPPlX?pageview=01gBRtfzTmHblYknXAMBUh0">Home Mini</a> for $19 (currently $25).</p>
      <p>Walmart is not currently selling any Amazon Echos, but it too will have the <a href="https://zdcs.link/GbpGV">Google Home Mini</a> for $19, and it will throw in a $5 Vudu credit. You can also get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/w7qXR">Google Home Mini + Google Chromecast + $10 Vudu credit</a> bundle for $35 (save $29). The <a href="https://zdcs.link/2kP41">Lenovo Smart Clock</a> will also be on sale for $39 (save $40).</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Black Friday Deals on Games and Consoles</h3>
      <p>Video games and game consoles are usually a good bet for Black Friday savings, but Walmart has a slight upper hand over Target this year.</p>
      <p>Walmart is teasing lots of $30 Nintendo Switch games, several of which are the cheapest they've ever been. Target has similar titles for $30 (Mario Odyssey, Mario Aces, Zelda: Breath of the Wild), but not as many.</p>
      <p>Both retailers will have a Nintendo Switch Mario Kart 8 bundle for $299 and the Gears 5 Xbox One X bundled for $350, though Target throws in a $40 gift card with the purchase of any Xbox console.</p>
      <p>Though the PS5 is on the horizon for 2020, neither Store is offering a discount or bundle on the Playstation 4 Pro.</p>
      <h3>Smartphones</h3>
      <p>In recent years, Black Friday deals on high-end smartphones have mostly included trade-in offers or gifts cards alongside a full-price purchase. Target is not offering deals for Sprint users, which could make a difference for some. Walmart's gift cards are also much higher and seem like the obvious choice.</p>
      <h4>Target</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>$200 gift card with activation on AT&amp;T or Verizon: iPhone XS, XS Max, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, and 11</li>
        <li>$400 gift card with activation on AT&amp;T or Verizon: Samsung Galaxy S10+, S10, or Note10+</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Walmart</h4>
      <p>Walmart is offering gift cards with activations on Sprint, AT&amp;T, and Verizon.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$450 gift card with the purchase of an iPhone XS</li>
        <li>$400 gift card with the iPhone XR or XS Max</li>
        <li>$300 gift card with the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max</li>
        <li>$450 gift card with the Galaxy S10, S10+, or Not 10+</li>
        <li>$300 gift card with the Galaxy S10e or Note 9</li>
        <li>$100 gift card when buying an iPhone 6s on Straight Talk or Total Wireless</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Walmart is also offering up to $250 in additional gift cards if you trade in a device.</p>
