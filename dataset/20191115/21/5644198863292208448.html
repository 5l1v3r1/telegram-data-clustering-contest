      <p>Wall Street's main stock indexes hit record highs on Friday, fueled by fresh optimism over a potential calming of U.S.-China trade tensions and by a strong forecast from semiconductor industry bellwether Applied Materials.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Wall Street's main stock indexes hit record highs on Friday, fueled by fresh optimism over a potential calming of U.S.-China trade tensions and by a strong forecast from semiconductor industry bellwether Applied Materials.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 was on track for its sixth straight week of gains.</p>

      <p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Thursday that the United States and China are getting close to a trade agreement, citing what he called very constructive talks with Beijing.</p>
      <p>“Today is definitely about optimism surrounding the trade tensions,” said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>The stock market has climbed recently to record highs, driven by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, third-quarter earnings topping low expectations and signs that economic growth may be bottoming, while uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations remains a wild card.</p>
      <p>"It’s definitely been a big source of volatility over a fairly long period of time for the markets and stocks in general," Pride said. "To see some sort of resolution of it would probably be a lift to investors and to equity holders because it takes away a big piece of uncertainty in many investors’, and even corporate executives’, minds.”</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 157.02 points, or 0.57per cent, to 27,938.98, the S&amp;P 500 gained 18.3 points, or 0.59per cent, to 3,114.93 and the Nasdaq Composite added 55.75 points, or 0.66per cent, to 8,534.76.</p>
      <p>All three indexes hit all-time highs during the session.</p>
      <p>Healthcare led the way among the S&amp;P 500 sectors, gaining 1.5per cent, helped by increases for Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer . All 11 sectors were in positive territory.</p>
      <p>Shares of Applied Materials soared 9.0per cent after the chip gear maker forecast first-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index gained 1.1per cent and hit a record high. Enthusiasm for the group was tempered by a 2.0per cent decline in Nvidia shares following the chipmaker's report.</p>
      <p>Data on Friday showed U.S. retail sales rebounded in October, but consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items and clothing, which could temper expectations for a strong holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.90-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 106 new highs and 93 new lows.</p>
