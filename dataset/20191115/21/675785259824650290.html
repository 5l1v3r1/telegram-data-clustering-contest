      <p>A Mexican gymnast who accused her coach of sexual assault has seen her allegations ignored.</p>
      <p>Victoria Mata, 19, claimed her coach Eric Demay spanked her bottom during a training session when she was 18.</p>
      <p>She spoke out to local media about the alleged incident, after the Mexican Gymnastics Federation chose not to act.</p>
      <p>Mata said: "You can clearly see how I am doing the physical preparation. He bends over and spanks me, I do not know what his intention was but I did not like it."</p>
      <p>The alleged incident was captured on video and was presented to the Mexican Gymnastics Federation FGM president, Gustavo Salazar, who reportedly did not see any "anomalies" in the video and snubbed Mata's request for the action to sanctioned.</p>

      <p>"It happened while I was doing the exercise, it only happened once. I told my parents, the first thing they asked me is if I had felt it. They were very uncomfortable like me."</p>
      <p>Both Eric Demay and his wife Cecile Demay were hired by Mexico to help the national team qualify to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>The Demays were eventually sacked by Salazar, however local media report the sacking had nothing to do with the accusations, but was due to Mexico not classifying to the next Olympics "which is what they were hired for" in March of this year.</p>
      <p>Mata won a bronze medal last year in the World Cup held in Guimaraes, Portugal and dreams of "participating in the Olympics".</p>
