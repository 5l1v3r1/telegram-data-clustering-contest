        <b>The Duchess of Sussex has accused the Mail on Sunday and its parent company of a campaign of "untrue" stories, according to new details of her legal action against the newspaper group.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Court papers filed against the group set out a list of "false" articles about Meghan,<a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i"> the website Byline says.</a></p>
      <p>Her lawyers claim the Mail on Sunday removed passages of a private letter to her father to portray her "negatively".</p>
      <p>The Mail on Sunday repeated its intent to defend the case "with vigour".</p>
      <p>"There is nothing in this document which changes that position," a spokesman said.</p>

      <p>In October, law firm Schillings, acting for the duchess, filed a High Court claim against the Mail on Sunday and its parent company over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
      <p>The claim came after the Mail on Sunday published a handwritten letter from Meghan to her father, Thomas Markle, sent shortly after she and Prince Harry got married in 2018.</p>
      <p>It is claimed the newspaper did not publish parts of the letter because it would undermine its "negative" portrayal of the duchess.</p>
      <p>The court papers claim that Meghan's father was exploited by journalists and say that reporters also invented a series of claims about her relationship with her mother.</p>
      <p>The duchess' lawyers will also accuse the Mail on Sunday's sister title the Daily Mail of printing "completely untrue" stories about renovations to Meghan and Prince Harry's home.</p>
      <p>They say that claims by the paper - also published on the Mail Online website - that a £5,000 copper bath and £500,000-worth of soundproofing were charged to the taxpayer were lies.</p>
      <h3>'Ruthless campaign'</h3>
      <p><a href="https://sussexofficial.uk/">In a statement last month</a>, the Duke of Sussex said he and Meghan were forced to take action against "relentless propaganda" and a "ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year".</p>
      <p>Prince Harry said the "painful" impact of intrusive media coverage had driven the couple to take action.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49940905">The duke has launched separate legal action</a> against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking.</p>
