      <p>When the White House on Friday <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/read-wh-releases-first-call-between-trump-zelensky-after-ukrainians-election">released a memorandum</a> of the first conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s president-elect, something popped out to eagle-eyed observers: The conversation was much different than the readout the White House issued at the time.</p>
      <p>By Friday afternoon, the administration had managed to blame the discrepancies on a key impeachment probe witness, National Security Council official <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/alexander-vindman-testimony">Alexander Vindman</a>.</p>
      <p>In April, when it released <a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1195350782411001856">its readout of the call</a> between the two leaders, the White House said Trump and then-Ukrainian President-elect Volodymyr Zelensky discussed heady diplomatic affairs — such as “the peaceful and democratic manner of the electoral process,” “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” and the effort to “root out corruption” in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the newly released<a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/read-wh-releases-first-call-between-trump-zelensky-after-ukrainians-election"> memorandum of the call</a>, which includes purported dialogue between the two men, doesn’t include any of that. Rather, it’s largely surface-level and even superficial.</p>
      <p>“When I owned Miss Universe, [Ukraine] always had great people,” Trump told Zelensky over the phone. “Ukraine was always very well represented.”</p>
      <p>What accounted for the difference? On Friday, a White House spokesperson blamed Vindman, the director for European affairs for the president’s National Security Council and a <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/alexander-vindman-testimony">key witness</a> in the ongoing impeachment probe.</p>
      <p>“It is standard operating procedure for the National Security Council to provide readouts of the President’s phone calls with foreign leaders,” White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley <a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1195448392987611136">said in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>“This one was prepared by the NSC’s Ukraine expert,” he said.</p>
      <p>Blaming Vindman for the discrepancy between the paragraph-length summary and the three-page memorandum of the call is an interesting choice. That’s because Vindman <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/read-impeachment-inquiry-releases-testimony-of-nsc-official-alexander-vindman">has testified</a> that the memorandum of the second, <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/white-house-releases-its-version-of-call-between-trump-and-ukraine-president">much more damning call</a> between Trump and Zelensky did not actually reflect the full conversation. Vindman listened in to both calls as part of his NSC duties.</p>
      <p>That July memorandum, unlike the memo of the leaders’ April discussion, is pock-marked with ellipses, and Vindman testified that it actually put words in the Ukrainian president’s mouth that Zelensky didn’t say.</p>
      <p>Specifically, Vindman testified, Zelensky referred to the actual name of the natural gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat, and into which Trump had asked Zelensky to open an investigation: “Burisma.”</p>
      <p>But the call memorandum says Zelensky instead referred to Burisma as “the company that you mentioned in this issue.”</p>
      <p>Another notable difference between the two calls is that there was no paragraph-long summary released for the second one. America’s own acting ambassador to Ukraine only found out about the call’s contents second-hand, when <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/top-us-diplomat-in-kyiv-never-got-a-readout-of-trumps-notorious-call-with-zelensky">another NSC official told him</a> that it “could have been better.”</p>
