      <p>Beau H. Rothwell, 28, is accused of killing his wife Jennifer Rothwell, also 28, Monday inside the couple’s home in Creve Coeur. He told police he last saw Jennifer early Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He was initially arrested Wednesday on evidence tampering charges — but charges were upgraded Friday to second-degree murder after investigators used DNA samples from Jennifer’s parents to confirm blood found inside the home was hers.</p>
      <p>Jennifer’s body hasn’t been found. She is presumed dead due to large spots of blood found on the carpet and carpet padding inside the couple’s home, according to Tim Swope, a spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell. Investigators believe she was killed on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Jennifer Rothwell,” Bell said in a statement. “This is a tragic incident and my office will do everything we can to see that justice is served in this case.”</p>
      <p>The prosecutor declined further comment in the case, citing an ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>Beau, who was ordered held without bail, was charged on Thursday with tampering with evidence after he was spotted on video buying supplies like bleach, carpet cleaner and gloves one day before his wife vanished, according to a probable cause statement.</p>
      <p>Beau was taken into custody late Wednesday, just hours after posting a plea for help on Facebook.</p>
      <p>“Some of you may have heard already, but last night my wife Jennifer went missing,” he wrote. “I’ve filed a police report and the search is ongoing. Please, if you hear of anything or have any information it would be greatly appreciated.”</p>
