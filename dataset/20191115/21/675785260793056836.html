      <p>Alongside actors Maureen, 73, Jennie, 35, and Alan, 37, is the local lawyer Imran Habeeb, played by Charlie de Melo.</p>
      <p>The lawyer may have been brought on board to provide legal assistance to the person facing potential jail time.</p>
      <p>Currently it's unclear whether Evelyn is in court because of her own trouble with the law, or whether it has something to do with Tyrone or Fiz.</p>

      <p>The scenes are currently shrouded in mystery but Jennie previously hinted at the troubling times ahead.</p>
      <p>She has promised a dramatic Christmas for Fiz, hinted there are going to be some major shocks, but refused to say if someone is getting killed off.</p>
      <p>Maureen told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/">Metro</a> that the storyline under the Dobbs roof would be centering around troublesome Jade.</p>
      <p>Viewers have been speculating about Jadeâ€™s intentions towards the Corrie couple but fans will just have to wait and see who is responsible for them ending up in court alongside Eveleyn.</p>
