      <p>SINGAPORE: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said on Friday (Nov 15) that it has suspended the licence of Namira Catering with immediate effect for multiple hygiene lapses.</p>

      <p>Plastic crates, containers and metal pots containing ready-to-eat food were also placed on the floor, which was stained with food waste and grime, said SFA.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, meat was improperly thawed, and unregistered food handlers were involved in food preparation, it added.</p>
      <p>Namira Catering is required to dispose of all ready-to-eat food, thawed food and perishable food items.</p>
      <p>It must also rectify lapses in its food preparation processes, sanitise its premises, utensils and equipment, as well as disinfect all tables, food preparation surfaces and floors.</p>
      <p>“All food handlers working in the suspended premises are required to re-attend and pass the Basic Food Hygiene Course, before they can resume work as food handlers,” SFA said.</p>
      <p>“The appointed Food Hygiene Officer(s) working at the suspended premises are also required to re-attend and pass the Food Hygiene Officer course before he/she can resume work as a Food Hygiene Officer.”</p>
      <p>SFA reminded operators that food safety is a “joint responsibility” as contamination can occur anywhere along the food chain.</p>
      <p>“All food operators should ensure that their premises are clean and well-maintained, and staff are adequately trained on proper food safety management,” it said.</p>
      <p>Enforcement action may be taken against food operators who do not adhere toregulations or comply with food hygiene and food safety requirements.</p>
      <p>Offenders may be fined up to S$5,000, with an additional S$100 for every day or part thereof if the offence continues after conviction.</p>
