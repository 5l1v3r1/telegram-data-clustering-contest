      <p>A woman who claims she gave birth to Future's child claims she cannot find the rapper to serve him with court papers to prove if he's the kid's father or not.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> One of the paternity suits filed against Future has been put on hold because the rapper has yet to be served with the legal notice.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/future-says-instagram-models-baby-claims-are-just-a-money-grab-OYRd5d6tLEWj7qejpf6D8g/2019-10-29T18:48:22.5743670Z/nJ5xXGdn1Em1fExClOP1sA/">Cindy Renae Parker filed papers against the Jumpman hitmaker, real name Nayvadius Wilburn, in Texas last month, claiming he is the father of her son Legend, who was born in July.</a>
      </p>
      <p>However, process servers have been unable to track the hip-hop star down, leaving her case at a standstill.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theblast.com/c/rapper-future-baby-mama-cindy-parker-texas-paternity-lawsuit-child-support-Eliza-Seraphin">According to The Blast,</a> a hearing originally scheduled for Thursday was canceled, and now Parker is requesting permission to have Future served in another way in a bid to keep her suit alive.</p>
      <p>The judge overseeing the case has yet to rule.</p>
      <p>Parker is seeking to establish paternity of her boy, to whom she has given Future's last name, and is also pursuing official child support and custody deals.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Future maintains he only has five baby mamas, including former fiancee Ciara, the mother of his five-year-old son Future Zahir.</p>
