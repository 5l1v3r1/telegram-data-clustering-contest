      <p>It was a rough week for cannabis companies. Four of the biggest businesses in the game – <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/cgc-stock">Canopy Growth</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/acb-stock">Aurora Cannabis</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/cron-stock">Cronos Group</a>, and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tlry-stock">Tilray</a> – reported earnings that fell short of analyst expectations.</p>
      <p>That led to stock declines across the board for the marijuana producers, ranging from a 2% slide for Tilray shares Wednesday to a 17.5% slide for Canopy Growth Friday.</p>
      <p>Now, shares of each company are a far cry from highs seen over the last year. In that time, the cannabis industry has dealt with a number of hurdles that have sent stock prices tumbling.</p>
      <p>“The headwinds around delayed retail development and corresponding bottlenecks at the wholesale level are likely to weigh heavily on results,” wrote W. Andrew Carter, an analyst at Stifel, in an earnings primer November 3.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-of-vape-related-illnesses-and-deaths-2019-9">Injuries related to vaping</a> have been a drag for the industry. And, regulatory issues have led <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/cannabis-producer-canntrust-to-destroy-77-million-of-weed-plants-2019-10-1028597358">at least one company to destroy millions of dollars</a> of weed inventory.</p>
      <p>Going forward, cannabis companies will need to spend heavily to grow, an “underappreciated aspect of the nascent, highly regulated, and quickly evolving category,” according to Carter.</p>
      <p>This is apparent for companies looking to capture the legal market in Canada, as well as those looking to capitalize on the CBD market in the US, Carter said. According to Stifel, the US CBD category could be worth $5 billion over the next few years.</p>
      <p>Here’s what four of the top cannabis companies reported in their quarterly earnings this week, and what effect that had on their stock prices a day after each earnings release:</p>
