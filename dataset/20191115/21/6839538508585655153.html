      <p>Proving once more that she is the most relatable royal, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge has visited sick children wearing a recycled dress.</p>
      <p>Kate officially opened the building in Norfolk on Friday.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10351239/kate-middleton-children-hospice-visit/">The Sun</a>, the 37-year-old, who is the Royal Patron of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH), appeared eager to meet with staff and patients at The Nook in Framingham Earl, after arriving by train just south of Norwich.</p>
      <p>The charity’s care service includes specialist nursing care, short breaks, therapies and counselling and volunteer services in the family home.</p>
      <p>Kate immediately bent down to meet three-year-old Stanley Harrold, who has the rare life-threatening chromosomal disorder Pallister Killian Syndrome.</p>

      <p>The duchess beamed as she met the young boy — whose parents Stef Partington and Joe Harrold were also at the visit.</p>
      <p>Mum Stef praised the children’s hospice, saying: “They have offered us support with music therapy. It is amazing as a family to do this, as it was the first time we saw Stan react to anything.”</p>

      <p>Kate looked stunning for the visit, wearing a £2700 (A$3966) Oscar de la Renta purple peplum dress paired with black tights.</p>
      <p>It is the latest example of the <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/444094964ada9f5aee7332de24213a7d">Duchess’s relatable approach</a> to fashion. She is a fan of sensibly rewearing her own garments, in this case, the dress which she wore in 2017 to a health writers’ conference.</p>
      <p>Kate later met other young children at the hospice – complimenting one little girl’s hair.</p>
      <p>She said: “I love your plaits.</p>
      <p>“My little girl Charlotte loves plaits but her hair’s only this long so we have to do them at the top.”</p>
      <p>She will unveil a plaque to officially open The Nook in Framingham Earl, about 10 kilometres south of Norwich.</p>
      <p>The mum is the Royal Patron of EACH, which cares for children and young people with life-threatening conditions across Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk and supports their families.</p>
      <p>The charity said it had outgrown its former Norfolk hospice site in Quidenham.</p>
      <p>Its new hospice was built following a five-year public appeal to raise £10 million (A$19 million) and it welcomed its first child to receive care in September this year.</p>

      <p>The new building, which contains more areas for clinical care and dedicated therapy rooms, will allow EACH to meet the increased demand for its service and the ever-changing and more complex needs of those it cares for.</p>
      <p>The duchess toured the facilities, including the hospice’s sensory room, and took part in arts and crafts activities with children.</p>
      <p>She joined a reception before making a short speech and unveiling a plaque to mark the official opening of ‘The Nook’.</p>
