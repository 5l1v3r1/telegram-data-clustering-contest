      <p>Corduroy has recently made a strong comeback in menswear, thanks in part to the fashion world’s obsession with all things 70s. Today’s corduroy pants aren’t the staid Ivy League professor look or the bell-bottomed versions of the past. From slimmer fits with a good amount of stretch to five-pocket versions to hybrid joggers, there’s a cord to suit an individual’s style.</p>
      <p>A great alternative to jeans or chinos, corduroy pants are ideal for cooler months thanks to their ability to keep you warm while remaining breathable and their hard-wearing properties. Corduroy is typically made from cotton or a cotton blend and features a velvety texture with raised ribs, known as wales.</p>
      <p>Corduroy pants are more versatile than jeans since they can be worn as business casual and still look great dressed down with a T-shirt, trucker or chore jacket, and sneakers. Wear them with what you’d typically pair with jeans or dress them up with a collared shirt and a blazer or sweater for a more sophisticated look.</p>

The San Francisco-based online retailer that launched in 2010 sells well-made outdoor apparel that can do double duty for a night out with friends. The Flint and Tinder line best represents this aesthetic and has been getting accolades from both customers and the media alike.</p>
      <p>The first thing I noticed when I slipped on the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=66cdaaa7-8814-4e40-89d5-6897c9314cab&amp;amp;website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuckberry.com%2Fstore%2Fflint-and-tinder%2Fcategory%2Fp%2F59203-365-corduroy-pants-slim&amp;amp;ctc=biipgf_110119_best-corduroy-pants">Flint and Tinder 365 Corduroy Pants</a> were their softness and stretch. They’re made from an 8-ounce fabric that’s 98% cotton and 2% spandex. More traditional cords tend to be heavier, so with these, you’ll be able to get more wear throughout the year; they’re probably not going to get you through the dead of winter, though. They’re also preshrunk so the pants are soft right out of the box. They come in three earth tones.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=66cdaaa7-8814-4e40-89d5-6897c9314cab&amp;amp;website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuckberry.com%2Fstore%2Fflint-and-tinder%2Fcategory%2Fp%2F59203-365-corduroy-pants-slim&amp;amp;ctc=biipgf_110119_best-corduroy-pants">The pants</a> are available in both a slim and straight fit. I have a thinner build so my preference is for the slimmer, tapered version, but both looked and felt good. The straight fit is roomier with a less tapered leg; bigger guys may be drawn to this fit.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=66cdaaa7-8814-4e40-89d5-6897c9314cab&amp;amp;website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuckberry.com%2Fstore%2Fflint-and-tinder%2Fcategory%2Fp%2F59203-365-corduroy-pants-slim&amp;amp;ctc=biipgf_110119_best-corduroy-pants">The 365 pants</a> have been around for a few years and are the company’s best sellers. This is the first year they’ve put out a corduroy version. While most of Flint and Tinder’s apparel is made in the UA, the 365 cords are made in Central Java, Indonesia. The pants are made at a sustainably focused manufacturing facility that “recycles all its scraps from the production process, recycles 98% of the water used on-site, and up-cycles garment treatment byproduct to make bricks used for local construction,” according to a company representative.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Manufactured using sustainable practices, super soft, and well-made</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Not made in the US like most of the Flint and Tinder products</p>

They feature a center crease, an off-center button closure at the front, slant front pockets, and welt rear pockets with buttons. They’re a bit dressier and of a slightly heavier weight than the 5-pocket styles included in this guide, however. They come in three colors: mole (a light tan), navy blue, and green.</p>
      <p>M&amp;S offers free returns and free delivery for orders over $50 (for anything less, the shipping cost is $5). The most common complaint was that the fly was on the short side.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Cold-weather friendly, nicely tailored, great price</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Some customers felt the fly was too short</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thomaspink.com/us/product/corduroy-trouser/21200084B3X">Pink Shirtmaker (formerly Thomas Pink)</a> is a London-based clothier launched in 1984 by three Irish brothers. While best known for its dress shirts, Pink has been making some beautifully crafted suits, pants, and knitwear under the creative leadership of Scottish-born designer John Ray who joined the company in 2017.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thomaspink.com/us/product/corduroy-trouser/21200084B3X">Corduroy Chino</a> beautifully combines traditional tailoring and a modern cut with a narrower leg. It’s made from Italian corduroy and finished in Romania. <a href="https://www.thomaspink.com/us/product/corduroy-trouser/21200084B3X">The pants</a> are individually washed for a broken-in look and feel. They feature a center crease, horn buttons, slant front pockets, side adjusters (you can forgo a belt if you so choose), welt back pockets, and an off-center button-front closure. Because they come unhemmed you can have them tailored to your specifications. They come in several colors, like vibrant blue, deep red, and sunflower yellow. These <a href="https://www.thomaspink.com/us/product/corduroy-trouser/21200084B3X">handsome cords</a> will get you from the office to a holiday party or to a date without missing a beat.</p>

They hug the thighs and butt without being constrictive and wear in nicely. Bigger guys may find these a little too slim of a silhouette for their build.</p>

They come in three colors: charcoal, scorched brown, and dark maple.</p>
      <p>Prana’s known for its dedication to sustainability. However, while these pants are made from <a href="https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/raw-materials/report-truth-organic-cotton-impacts-68512/">organic cotton</a> – a major deal considering the <a href="http://www.intracen.org/Conventional-cotton/">huge amount of agrochemicals</a> used in conventional cotton production – they aren’t produced at a sustainably focused manufacturing facility like much of the company’s apparel.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Lightweight, very comfortable, a lot of stretches, and a modern slim silhouette</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> May not be the best cut for bigger guys, not great for winter, not as sustainable as some of Prana’s other products</p>
