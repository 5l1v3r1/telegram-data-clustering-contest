      <p>Update 0.8.10 was recently released by Wargaming for <b><i>World of Warships</i></b>. This update brought with it the full branch of the Italian cruisers as well as the unlockable Italian commander, <b>Luigi Sansonetti</b>. There are 10 Italian cruisers in total now and players can research them all now. Players can also check out the “Resolute and Rapid” themed collection to check out highlights of the Italian Navy’s history.</p>
      <p>Sansonetti (from World War II) is the latest commander to join the game and will let you access talents after achieving goals in a battle. For example, if you destroy an enemy ship, your main battery guns’ maximum range will increase. Sansonetti also features the Expert Loader and Torpedo Acceleration skills. Players will also be able to enjoy the specialized personalization options that come with Sansonetti such as a broad pennant, colored shell tracers, and a signal flare that goes off when his talents are activated.</p>
      <p>While many players will be excited about the ships and commander, the update also features visual enhancements to 10 maps and two ports and prepares <i>World of Warships</i> for the next Ranked Battle Season. What’s your favorite part of the update?</p>
