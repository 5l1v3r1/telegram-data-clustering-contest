      <p>Pharmacies at four Saskatchewan Safeway stores will remain open even though the stores themselves will close for renovations next year.</p>
      <p>In July, it was announced that four Safeway stores — one in Regina and three in Saskatoon — would close next year for renovations and construction in preparation for the opening of four FreshCo locations in their place. The FreshCo stores are expected to open sometime in the summer of 2020.</p>
      <p>The four Safeway locations will close for a four-to-five-month period, but pharmacies in each will remain open during renovations.</p>
      <p>“During construction, our same Safeway pharmacy teams will continue to serve customers in temporary pharmacy locations that will be conveniently located at the current Safeway locations,” read a news release from Empire Company Limited.</p>
      <p>Once renovations are complete, the new FreshCo locations will open with their own pharmacy departments.</p>
      <p>“There will be no interruption in patient care or customer files,” the release read.</p>
      <p>The Regina Safeway on Sherwood Drive will close on March 14 at 6 p.m. The stores in Saskatoon include the locations on Confederation Drive, 33rd Street and Market Mall, all to close on Feb. 29  at 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>Opening dates for the new FreshCo locations have yet to be confirmed.</p>
