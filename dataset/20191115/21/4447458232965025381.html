      <p>Legendary Television has signed a deal to produce a TV series based on Frank Miller's <b>Sin City</b>, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/sin-city-tv-series-frank-miller-robert-rodriguez-legendary-television-1202787314/">according</a> to <i>Deadline</i>.</p>
      <p>Frank Miller will produce the series, with director Robert Rodriguez, who helmed 2005's <b>Sin City</b> film, in talks to join him as producer. As part of the deal, which <i>Deadline</i> reports is contingent on finding a network or streaming service to air the series, Miller will also produce an R-rated animated<b> Sin City</b> feature.</p>
