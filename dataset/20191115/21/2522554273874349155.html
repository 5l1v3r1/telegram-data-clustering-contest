      <h1>Jay-Z Pressured NFL to Set Up Colin Kaepernick Workout Because Hov Felt His Reputation Was Damaged: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:43:15+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/marisamendez/" target="_blank">Marisa Mendez</a></address>
      <p>According to sports analyst Dan Patrick, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/jay-z/">Jay-Z</a>'s alleged influence in getting <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/colin-kaepernick/">Colin Kaepernick</a> a workout with the NFL stemmed from the heat that Hov was feeling behind-the-scenes.</p>
      <p>On Friday (Nov. 15), Patrick revealed on his self-titled DirecTV show that his sources gave him some insight on Kap's upcoming combine-style workout exhibition. According to Patrick, Jay felt major backlash when he announced <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/08/jay-z-roc-nation-partnership-nfl/">his partnership with the NFL for a social justice initiative</a>, and he wanted to fix the "reputational bullet."</p>
      <p>"My source says Jay-Z was putting pressure on the commissioner because according to my source, Jay-Z said that he took a reputational bullet for the commissioner when they had that press conference, his new role with the NFL—the social agenda, social injustice," Patrick said.</p>
      <p>Patrick continued: "He was going to help with the entertainment for halftime, all of this. And my source said that Jay-Z was pressuring the commissioner to do the right thing and have this workout for Colin Kaepernick and that he had taken a reputational bullet when he first took this job. And I understand that. But that was what I was told with the pressure here with the commissioner—that Jay-Z said, 'Hey look, I don't want to be viewed as a sellout here!' Those are my words, not his, but he was saying a reputational bullet."</p>

      <p>In a tweet he posted hours after the airing of his comments about Jay and the NFL, Patrick said, "I have been in touch with other well-placed sources who say that any Jay-Z narrative seems like another distraction to take away from the opportunity facilitated by the NFL for Colin Kaepernick."</p>

      <p>Jay-Z and Roc Nation announced their partnership with the NFL back in August. Hov and Roc Nation are now handling entertainment from the league (like the Super Bowl halftime show, among other things), as well as with social justice initiatives. Many, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/08/eric-reid-calls-out-jay-z-nfl-team-ownership/">including NFL player Eric Reid</a>, criticized Hov for the move at the time for joining forces with a corporation that is seemingly keeping Kaepernick out on purpose.</p>
      <p>Jay addressed the concerns ahead of time during his announcement of the partnership.</p>
      <p>“The NFL has a great big platform, and it has to be all-inclusive,” he said. “They were willing to do some things, to make some changes, that we can do some good.”</p>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick's NFL workout is scheduled to take place in Atlanta on Saturday (Nov. 16) at 3 p.m. EST.</p>
