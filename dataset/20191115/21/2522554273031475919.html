      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:56:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/peterberry/" target="_blank">Peter A. Berry</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/lil-reese/">Lil Reese</a> is out of the hospital after reportedly being shot in the neck.</p>
      <p>On Friday (Nov. 15), Reese appeared on his Instagram Live. In the clip, which has gone viral on social media, the Chicago rapper is covered in a black hood while looking at the comment section while bopping his head to Jon B.'s 1997 song, "They Don't Know."</p>
      <p>The rapper was shot on Country Club Hills, Ill.'s 167th Street and someone reportedly took him to the hospital before police arrived at the scene. He had been in South Suburban Hospital's emergency room before being transferred to Advocate Christ Medical Center where he was said to be in critical condition.</p>

      <p>"I like Jay Z because hes rich. He knew what he wanted. Nas, cant nobody fuck with Nas. Hes the best rapper, personally. I like Tupac because I was fucked up as a kid, going through a struggle. I like B.I.G. because homie was a stupid player. And Gucci, I can relate to him because Im from the South." - <a href="http://allhiphop.com/2010/03/22/top-5-dead-or-alive-waka-flocka/">Waka Flocka Flame</a></p>

      <p>“I would say Nas, that’s my favorite rapper. It’s tough, because [Jay Z] is one of the greatest and many can argue, but Nas is so poetic with it and I feel like his lyrics, you can write them down on paper and they will last for time. It would be like literature that we read.” - <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/common-my-mother-is-my-best-friend-44204611587">Common</a></p>
