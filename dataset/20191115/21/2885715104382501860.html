      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:57:39+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>The Supreme Court Friday called out the odd-even scheme of the Delhi government, calling it “half-baked” in its current form, as pollution levels in the capital had only spiked, despite its implementation which was causing transportation difficulties to people.</p>
      <p>“A half-baked odd-even scheme… either you have a full odd-even and give no exceptions… instead you allow two- and three-wheelers which cause more pollution,” Justice Deepak Gupta told senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Delhi government.</p>
      <p>Rohatgi said studies had shown that it had helped reduce pollution levels by 5-12%, and added that the city will collapse if two-wheelers too are stopped from plying.</p>
      <p>The bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra quizzed CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava on the effectiveness of the odd-even scheme in the national capital.</p>
      <p>“Are we getting benefited by it?” Justice Mishra asked the official, who replied “not more than 3-4 percent”. He added that of the figures for vehicular pollution, cars contribute only 3%.</p>
      <p>Justice Mishra then turned to Rohatgi and said “odd-even may not be the actual solution”.</p>
      <p>Appearing for the Union Environment Ministry, Additional Solicitor General A N S Nadkarni too cited CPCB data and said the odd-even scheme was not helping reduce pollution levels.</p>
      <p>Rohatgi said the actual culprit was stubble burning and that it offsets whatever gains are achieved by odd-even.</p>
      <p>Justice Mishra pointed out that the pollution levels will further spike when the fog increases and added “then odd-even will not help you”.</p>
      <p>The CPCB official said that the immediate solution lay in preventing garbage burning and dealing with the hotspots identified in NCR.</p>
      <p>Justice Mishra said “pollution levels are increasing despite odd-even, whatever be the reason”.</p>
      <p>The court also expressed concern over the continuing stubble burning despite its November 6 order to take action to control these and asked Chief Secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to appear before it on November 25.</p>
