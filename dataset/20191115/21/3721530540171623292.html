      <p>Grinding Gear Games announced a sequel to its popular dungeon-crawler action RPG, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/path-of-exile/7016"><i>Path of Exile</i></a>. The developer revealed <i>Path of Exile 2,</i> and released the game’s first trailer, which you can watch at the top of this post, during its annual ExileCon event.</p>
      <p>The trailer starts with a loan hero escaping their own execution, before transitioning to the traditional top-down view, and showing off the game’s new enemies and abilities. The dark and terrifying enemies and environments of the first game look to be returning this time around, but the trailer fades out to reveal a character running around a boat, suggesting that players may travel to new and distant lands this time around.</p>
      <p>Grinding Gear Games also released a 14-minute gameplay preview of <i>Path of Exile 2</i>, which you can watch below.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/exilecon/one">announcement</a> also reveals that the game will features a new seven-act storyline, as well as the tantalizing phrase, “one game, two campaigns.” This Players can choose whether they’d like to play the <i>Path of Exile 2</i> campaign or the original game’s campaign, but both will lead to the same endgame. <i>Path of Exile 2</i> will also feature all of the same expansion content that has been added to <i>Path of Exile</i> since its original release in 2013.</p>
      <p><i>Path of Exile 2</i> will come with 19 new Ascendancy Classes, these will come from the same archetypes as the Exiles from the original game, but feature different abilities. There will also be a new Skill Gem system that replaces the previous skill system, and allows players the same level of customization, without some of the old system’s hassles.</p>
      <p>Grinding Gear Games makes it clear on the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/exilecon/one"><i>Path of Exile 2</i> website</a> that the game doesn’t have a release date yet. However, it does mention that the developer would like to start a beta by late 2020 at the earliest, and that development of <i>Path of Exile 2</i> won’t slow down the regular three-month cycle of expansions for the original game that players have become accustomed to.</p>
