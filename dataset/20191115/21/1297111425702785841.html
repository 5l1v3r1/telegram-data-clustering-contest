      <p>Luke Combs sold out the SaskTel Centre in Saskatoon last month. During his next Saskatchewan concert, there will be room for a much bigger audience.</p>
      <p>Combs is scheduled as the Sunday night closer for the 2020 Country Thunder festival in Craven, which is set for July 9-12.</p>
      <p>The Country Thunder lineup, announced Friday at Revival Music Room in Regina, also includes headliners Kane Brown, Dan &amp; Shay, and Clint Black.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/surprise-surprise-chris-stapletons-heading-to-country-thunder-saskatchewan">Traditionally, the next year’s big headliner is announced at the festival.</a> That didn’t happen in 2019 — because of Combs’ Saskatoon show on Oct. 10.</p>
      <p>“We would have loved to have announced a headline act, but just due to contractual obligations we were unable to. And if we were going to announce someone, it’s going to be the Sunday closer,” Country Thunder spokesman Gerry Krochak said by phone this week.</p>

      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/review-garth-brooks-puts-on-epic-show-post-storm-at-mosaic-stadium">Krochak compared Combs to Garth Brooks: “He’s not just a country superstar. He’s a music superstar and everything he touches turns to gold</a> … His music and his persona just connect with people in ways that I’ve never really seen outside of somebody like Brooks.”</p>
      <p>From North Carolina, Combs’ six first singles all went to No. 1, including “Beer Never Broke My Heart,” “Hurricane” and “One Number Away.”</p>
      <p>“To look at this lineup now and see arguably the three hottest young acts in country music,” said Krochak, “I think is going to be a pretty big deal.”</p>
      <p>Krochak says Brown is a crossover success who “definitely is going to appeal to younger fans, but also certainly isn’t going to turn off any of the traditionalists.”</p>
      <p>Of Chattanooga, Tenn., Brown’s hits include “What Ifs,” “Heaven,” “Lose It,” and “Good As You.”</p>

      <p>On a similar note, Dan &amp; Shay are “the epitome of (pop) crossover,” recently having collaborated with Justin Bieber on the song “10,000 Hours”; the YouTube video for the song has more than 70 million views.</p>
      <p>The duo of Dan Smyers (Pennsylvania) and James Shay Mooney (Arkansas) have other hits including “Nothin’ Like You,” “How Not To,” and “Speechless.”</p>

      <p>“It’s been an interesting lineup to approach from a marketing standpoint,” said Krochak.</p>
      <p>Clint Black most recently performed in Craven in 2009. A classic country act whose 1989 debut album Killin’ Time had four consecutive No. 1 singles, Black isn’t the only well-known name on the roster.</p>

      <p>Wynonna Judd (“No One Else On Earth,” “To Be Loved By You”) and Tanya Tucker (“Delta Dawn,” “Two Sparrows In A Hurricane”) are also scheduled for 2020.</p>
      <p>Other acts announced are Canadians Tenille Arts (originally from Weyburn), the James Barker Band, Chad Brownlee, Jade Eagleson, Andrew Hyatt, MacKenzie Porter, Tenille Townes, the Washboard Union and Bobby Wills.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/shake-the-lake-toque-honours-heroes-of-classic-canadian-rock">Canadian rock cover band Toque (featuring Saskatchewan expats Cory Churko and Todd Kerns) are also part of the lineup.</a>

        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/eldest-hunter-brother-talks-craven-camaraderie-and-quick-turnarounds">The Hunter Brothers of Shaunavon are booked to come back for a third consecutive year.</a>
      </p>
      <p>They were a near casualty of the weather during the 2019 festival, which saw <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/no-refunds-for-drinks-tickets-after-second-storm-shuts-down-beer-gardens-on-final-night-of-country-thunder">Sunday night’s beer garden stage shut down early,</a> and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/tim-mcgraw-cancelled-after-storm-rolls-through-country-thunder-saskatchewan-site">Saturday night’s main stage cancelled before Tim McGraw could perform.</a> Travis Tritt’s set was cut short by wind and lightning.</p>

      <p>“We’ve had near perfect weather for about five years in a row and it was disappointing to lose a headliner,” said Krochak. “But I think the thing that I’ll remember the most is seeing the way that people came together, helped each other out and kept each other safe. I was also real proud of our team.</p>
      <p>“Disappointing to not have McGraw, but one of our most memorable festivals, and an incredible evening with Stapleton the next day.”</p>
      <p>Comedy duo Williams and Ree have not been announced as returning to Country Thunder in 2020. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/comedian-fsin-disagree-after-fsin-calls-joke-used-at-country-thunder-racist">The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations accused the duo of “racist material” during its 2019 performance.</a></p>
