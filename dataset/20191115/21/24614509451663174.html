      <blockquote>“We are working toward completing IND enabling studies of BP1003, a novel liposomeincorporated STAT3 oligodeoxynucleotide inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumors, and expect to file an IND application for a Phase 1 study of BP1003 for the treatment of solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer in 2020. Pancreatic cancer patients have extremely limited treatment options, consequently, we are dedicated to moving this therapy forward as quickly as possible.”</blockquote>
