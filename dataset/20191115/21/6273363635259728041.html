      <h1>Path of Exile 2 announced at ExileCon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:35:01+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/mike-minotti/" target="_blank">Mike Minotti</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/01/path-of-exile-synthesis-player-numbers/">Grinding Gear Games</a> announced Path of Exile 2 today, a sequel to its hit online action role-playing game. The reveal came during ExileCon, which is taking place in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The studio also announced Path of Exile Mobile as well. Grinding Gear is doing it in-house instead of farming it out to a mobile company, as it wants to retain its design ethos of “ethical transactions” — no times gates, not energy bars, etc.</p>
      <p>The original Path of Exile came out back in 2013. Many Diablo fans saw it as an alternative to Diablo III, a game that some felt strayed too far from Diablo II’s formula. Path of Exile is also free-to-play using what it calls “ethical microtransactions” in which is charges for cosmetics that don’t spenders any in-game advantages.</p>
      <p>Path of Exile 2’s announcement comes at an interesting time, as Blizzard just announced <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/02/blizzard-explains-how-diablo-iv-is-different-from-diablo-iii/">Diablo IV</a> earlier this month. The two games could end up competing with each other.</p>

      <p>The sequel will offer new seven-act campaign, but the original campaign from the first Path of Exile will also be available, along with the content from its expansions. Path of Exile 2 is also adding a new skill system, improvements to the game engine, and new classes.</p>
      <p>Neither title has a release date, although Grinding Gear Games that even a beta isn’t likely to start for Path of Exile 2 until late in 2020.</p>
