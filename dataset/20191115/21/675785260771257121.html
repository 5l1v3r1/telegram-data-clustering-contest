      <h2>Didier Drogba was offered the chance to work with former Chelsea teammate Frank Lampard, after the ex-midfielder was made Blues manager this summer, but decided to snub it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:37:17+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:37</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Didier Drogba has revealed that he turned down the chance to return to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> again this summer - because he is committed to helping Ivorian football.</p>
      <p>Blues legend Drogba, 41, scored 180 times in 381 appearances for the west London outfit during two glittering spells at the club.</p>
      <p>During his first stint at Stamford Bridge, between 2004 and 2012, Drogba won the Premier League three times before returning to lift the trophy again in the 2014/15 campaign.</p>
      <p>The striker, who retired from playing last year, also has four FA Cup, three League Cup and a Champions League winner's medal from his Chelsea days.</p>

      <p>And Blues boss Frank Lampard wanted to tap into that winning mentality and bring his former teammate back to the club.</p>
      <p>But ex-Ivory Coast international Drogba politely rejected the offer, despite it being "perfect".</p>
      <p>"I had an offer to stay at Chelsea where everything would be perfect and conditions are met," Drogba said.</p>

      <p>"But I want to help Ivorian football because I love it!</p>
      <p>"I am a leader, and my vision is bigger than just the simple role of being a coach. A coach has an impact on a club â€“ but I want to have an impact on an entire nation.</p>
      <p>"I want us to re-think football, with a nationwide vision, so we can develop the game here. The Ivory Coast has a glorious footballing past.</p>
      <p>"The funds are in place, together with talent and potential, but they are under-exploited.</p>
      <p>"There are some very competent people in the Ivory Coast who can work with me on this project."</p>
