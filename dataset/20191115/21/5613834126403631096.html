      <h1>Legendary Television Developing “Sin City” TV Series; Robert Rodriguez in Talks to Join the Project</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:12:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/john-squires/" target="_blank">John Squires</a></address>
      <p>It’s been five years since the release of feature film sequel <i>Sin City: A Dame to Kill For</i>, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/sin-city-tv-series-frank-miller-robert-rodriguez-legendary-television-1202787314/">Deadline</a> reports today that <b>Frank Miller</b>‘s world is next headed to the small screen!</p>
      <p><b>Legendary Television</b>, the site notes, has closed an agreement with Miller to turn<b><i> Sin City</i></b> into a television series. A deal with <b>Robert Rodriguez</b>, they say, is “close.”</p>
      <p>Deadline details, <i>“The deal on the table is for Legendary to guarantee a first season of the show, contingent on them setting it up with a network or streaming platform.”</i></p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The deal with Miller also calls for a hard R animated series for a Sin City prequel based on Miller’s graphic novels.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Robert Rodriguez co-directed 2005’s <i>Sin City</i> and its sequel <i>A Dame to Kill For</i> with Miller, and both are likely to be executive producers (and possible directors) of the TV series.</p>
      <p><i>Sin City</i>, you may recall, was being turned into a series by TWC/Dimension back in 2017, with Glen Mazzara and director Len Wiseman attached. But Miller regained the rights last year.</p>
