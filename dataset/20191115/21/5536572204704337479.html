      <p>Chuck Liddell thinks he could come out on top in a hypothetical street fight against Mike Tyson.</p>
      <p>During an interview with business personality Ed Mylett — Liddell stated while Mike would beat him in a boxing match, he would definitely win in MMA and if they were to meet in an alley.</p>
      <p>“Street fight, I win,” Liddell said. “I mean, he’s got a puncher’s chance. He’s got a chance to catch me coming in. But other than that, it’s over.”</p>
