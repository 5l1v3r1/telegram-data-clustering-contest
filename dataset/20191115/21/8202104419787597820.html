      <h3>REGINA — Saskatchewan’s trade minister says the government won’t be making partisan staff appointments to three new international offices.</h3>
      <p>Jeremy Harrison says hiring decisions will be made by the public service, and taxpayers won’t see the trade offices filled with former politicians or large donors to the Saskatchewan Party.</p>
      <p>Premier Scott Moe on Thursday announced new offices in Japan, India and Singapore as part of a plan to expand exports and strengthen trade relationships.</p>

      <p>Harrison says the move is proof that Saskatchewan is asserting more provincial autonomy.</p>
      <p>“As dependent as we are on international trade, we need to be in these markets because we have seen things go the wrong way,” he said Friday.</p>
      <p>The province currently has one office in Shanghai that’s budgeted to cost around $335,000 this year. It’s staffed with one government employee, as well as a local assistant and business development officer.</p>
      <p>A government spokesman has said opening the three new centres is expected to cost a total of about $4.2 million.</p>
      <p>Harrison is to leave this weekend on a trade mission to India and is to be accompanied by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, whose consulting company the province has hired on a one-year contract for $240,000.</p>
      <p>Harrison said Harper’s experience in trade negotiations will benefit Saskatchewan as it tries to maintain and expand its relationships overseas.</p>
      <p>He said there’s been a decline in Saskatchewan exports to India to about $650 million last year from about $2 billion in 2015.</p>
      <p>Harrison has criticized current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2018 trip to India as hurting the province. He suggested it factored into Saskatchewan’s decision to assert itself more strongly internationally.</p>
      <p>“I know whether I would rather have with us on this mission to India the former or current prime minister accompanying us.”</p>
