      <p>Nagaland Governor R N Ravi, who is the government’s interlocutor for peace talks with Naga insurgent groups, on Friday met leaders of the United Naga Council (UNC) of Manipur at Kohima and exhorted them to bridge the gap between the hill and valley people of the state.</p>
      <p>Ravi expressed concern over deterioration of “traditional brotherly relations” between these two communities in Manipur, stating that the vexed issue cannot reach its logical conclusion without taking all neighbours into confidence.</p>
      <p>In an official statement released on Friday, Ravi said he met the leaders of the apex body of Naga tribes of Manipur in his endeavour towards a comprehensive resolution of the Naga issue with due regards to the sensitivities of all the stakeholders, including the neighbours.</p>
      <p>“The Government of India interlocutor expressed concern over deterioration in the traditional brotherly relations between the hill and the valley people of Manipur in recent decades due to the politics of vested interests. The reality that the Naga issue cannot be resolved in isolation or reach its logical conclusion without taking all stakeholders, including the neighbours, into confidence was re-emphasised,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>Ravi said the imperatives of restoring the traditional harmonious relation among the hill and the valley people of Manipur were adequately emphasised.</p>
      <p>“The UNC leaders were exhorted to take effective measures to reach out to the valley people in the spirit of mutual love and understanding for an enduring peaceful co-existence,” it said.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, the UNC leaders were briefed about the current status of the peace talks, including the significant development of amicably settling all contentious issues between the negotiating parties.</p>
      <p>“When the Naga issue is at the stage of settlement, the UNC leaders were reminded of their responsibility in ensuring that the Naga tribes of Manipur maintain a cordial relationship with the fellow communities of the state,” it said.</p>
      <p>Negotiations to find a lasting solution to the seven-decade insurgency problem in Nagaland are on, with Ravi holding discussions with insurgent group NSCN-IM regularly in recent months.</p>
      <p>A framework agreement was signed on August 3, 2015 by NSCN-IM leader Thuingaleng Muivah and Ravi in the presence of Prime Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a>.</p>
