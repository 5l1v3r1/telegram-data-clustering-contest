      <h1>Mkhwebane welcomes release of 'rogue unit' report to her by state security minister</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sesona Ngqakamba</a></address>
      <p>Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says Minister of State Security Ayanda Dlodlo has handed her a redacted version of the Inspector General of Intelligence (IGI) report, which found that the so-called SARS "rogue unit" was unlawful. </p>
      <p>"In a settlement reached in terms of Rule 43 of the Uniform Rules of Court, Minister Dlodlo offered advocate Mkhwebane a redacted version of the report on Monday, November 4, 2019," the Office of the Public Protector said in a statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>Mkhwebane thanked her for "finally" handing over the report.  </p>
      <p>The EFF had opposed Dlodlo's bid to stop the classified report from being made public. Afterwards, the party <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-eff-releases-classified-intelligence-report-into-rogue-sars-unit-linked-to-gordhan-20190930">released</a> the document to the media after publishing it on their website. The EFF was of the view that the report being kept a secret was an abuse of judicial resources. </p>

      <p>Mkhwebane came out in support of the EFF, saying the report supported her findings that the intelligence unit acted unlawfully.</p>
      <p>In October, she filed an affidavit in the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria saying Dlodlo, whom she addressed as the "applicant", had promised to give her a declassified copy of the report as part of her separate investigation into the "rogue unit", but had "failed to deliver".</p>
