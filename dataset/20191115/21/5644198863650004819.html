      <p>The efforts are a part of Chief Executive Officer Jill Soltau's strategy to turn around the business, after it faced years of falling sales in a changing retail landscape following Amazon.com Inc's entry.</p>
      <p>"We are beginning to see results â€“ both in our numbers and how we operate as a business," Soltau said in a statement on Friday.</p>

      <p>Excluding one-time items, J.C. Penney reported a loss of 30 cents per share, smaller than the average analyst estimate of a loss of 55 cents.</p>
      <p>The company said net loss narrowed to US$93 million, or 29 cents per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 2, from US$151 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
      <p>J.C. Penney's total revenue fell 8.5per cent to US$2.5 billion in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>The company also said it now expects its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the year to exceed US$475 million, compared with its prior outlook of US$440 million to US$475 million.</p>
