      <p>An 11-year-old has shot to viral stardom thanks to his unique reaction to winning free chicken for a year.</p>
      <p>Sam Caruana won the prize after queuing to be one of the first 100 customers at a new Chick-fil-A restaurant in Cheektowaga, New York – so a local news outlet caught up with him to ask how he was feeling.</p>

      <p>“Well, uh, I’m here in the freezing cold getting free chicken sandwiches,” Sam toldd local news outlet WGRZ.</p>
      <p>“Because the food tastes great. I mean, it’s chicken, fried chicken, fried chicken. I like fried chicken!”</p>
      <p>Clearly a lot of people found Sam’s explanation relatable, as it has been viewed over five million times since it was posted to Twitter by reporter Leanne Stuck early on Thursday morning.</p>

      <p>Although some thought the matter-of-fact response suggested Sam was little old for his years.</p>

      <p>Sam’s prize consists of a free Chick-fil-A meal every week for a year, awarded by the restaurant to the first 100 people who line up outside their new outlets.</p>
      <p>The young prize-winner’s rousing speech reminded some people of other young stars of local news.</p>
