      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:14:56+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/tabassum-barnagarwala/" target="_blank">Tabassum Barnagarwala</a></address>
      <p>CONSTRUCTION OF 58 per cent of new primary health centres (PHCs) sanctioned under the National Health Mission (NHM) remains pending across Maharashtra, data accessed from the public health department over the last 13 years has revealed. Since 2007, of the 233 new PHCs approved, only 97 have been completed.</p>
      <p>A PHC caters to a population of around 20,000 to 30,000, and forms the first point of contact after a sub-centre (which caters to over 5,000 people) for basic healthcare services like delivery, treatment of non-communicable diseases and primary hospitalisation. Lack of infrastructure remains a major hurdle, forcing patients to skip PHCs and instead seek treatment from district hospitals, thereby overcrowding them.</p>
      <p>Data shows that in 2018-19, 90 new projects for PHC construction were undertaken. Till date, not even a single structure has been finished. While public health department officials blame delay on part of the PWD, health activists say patients are the only sufferers.</p>
      <p>Since 2007, 1,124 projects to build sub-centres, PHCs, community health centres, sub-district hospitals and district hospitals have been approved under NHM. The one district hospital approved in 2018-19 remains incomplete, and of the 19 community centres, only 10 have been constructed. Abhijeet More, an official associated with Jan Arogya Abhiyan, said even the PHCs that have been constructed do not have enough medical staff to serve patients. “The idea of a PHC is to prevent people from travelling a long way to reach the district hospital. But a PHC is unable to provide even primary healthcare,” he added.</p>
      <p>The situation gets better when it comes to undertaking repair work of public health structures. Of the 8,346 repair works approved since 2007, 96 per cent projects have been finished. But data analysed over the last 13 years shows the rate of completion of work has slowed down significantly over the years.</p>
      <p>For instance, all 1,054 repair projects in 2012-13 and 224 of 225 repairs works in 2013-14 were completed. But in 2017-18, only two of 20 and in 2018-19, none of the 74 repair works sanctioned have till date been completed. For 2019-20, 149 repair works in district hospitals, PHCs, community health centres and sub-district hospitals have been approved.</p>
      <p>Officials from the Directorate of Health Services said each file for renovation or redevelopment has to go through multiple approvals before construction can be undertaken. “The PWD also needs to promptly start work,” an official said.</p>
      <p>In Melghat, which records high malnutrition deaths, construction of PHCs in Salona, Harisal and Semadoh has been pending for years. “In Amravati, a super-specialty hospital was constructed three years ago but it is yet to start functioning. The government needs to plan how they will rope in doctors when they invest so much money in construction,” said B S Sane, from NGO Khoj.</p>
      <p>Anup Kumar Yadav, Director of NHM, said they have demanded funds to finish pending projects. The state government has also identified 68 PHCs this year where staff quarters will be constructed for doctors, nurses and para-medical staff. “These are PHCs with high delivery burden. We want doctors to live on campus and provide emergency services,” said Yadav. Each PHC will have 14 residential rooms for doctors, nurses and auxiliary nurse midwives.</p>
