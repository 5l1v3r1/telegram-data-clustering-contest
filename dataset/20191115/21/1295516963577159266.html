      <h1>Morrison's The Green Lantern To Introduce New Guardians of the Universe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:11:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Dominguez</a></address>
      <p>The adventures of Hal Jordan will continue this coming February in writer Grant Morrison and artist Liam Sharp's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-green-lantern/">The Green Lantern: Season Two</a>. And the comic's first issue is already set to alter the status quo of the Green Lantern mythos by introducing Hal to something he likely wasn't prepared for: young Guardians of the Universe.</p>
      <p>"The first issue is about Hal Jordan going in search of replacements for the Guardians of the Universe," Morrison said in an interview with <a href="https://ew.com/books/2019/11/14/grant-morrison-liam-sharp-green-lantern-season-two-comic-preview/">Entertainment Weekly</a>. "It ties into all the big stuff that’s happening in the DC Universe next year, so there’s a little bit of that but the fun was 'let’s mess up the status quo.' It’s a little bit like PC Principal from <i>South Park</i>, where suddenly everything’s changed at the top.</p>

      <p>"These are new Guardians with very different ideas of what’s right and wrong," the writer continued. "Instead of Hal butting heads with these geriatric space dudes that he always had problems with, where he was the young cocky guy and they were the old heads, suddenly we have Young Guardians. It’s also having a little bit of fun with this 'ok boomer' thing."</p>
      <p>As Morrison mentions, the Green Lantern known as Hal Jordan has historically been portrayed a a rebellious figure as far as the ancient Guardians of the Universe were concerned, often challenging their antiquated beliefs and practices. With the advent of the Young Guardians, however, it seems as though Hal may soon find himself on the other side of the generational divide.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the interview with <i>EW</i>, Morrison noted that the second season of <i>The Green Lantern</i> will focus on more on one-off stories. Additionally, readers can expect to see familiar faces, as well as the fantasy planet we caught a glimpse of in issue #9. Finally, much like how <i>Season One</i> saw Hal Jordan rekindle his partnership with Green Arrow, <i>Season Two</i> will see a Green Lantern/Flash team-up.</p>
