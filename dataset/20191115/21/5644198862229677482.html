      <p>Investigations revealed that one of the men had entered a room in a commercial building at about 12.15am on Monday, while the other three acted as lookout.</p>
      <p>“Upon entry, he impersonated as a ‘CID officer’ and demanded to search the victim’s property,” police said. “Out of fear, the victim surrendered his valuables from the safe containing cash and jewellery.”</p>
      <p>The four men, aged between 28 and 37, were arrested on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>They will be charged in court on Saturday with robbery with common intention, which carries a prison term of two to 10 years and at least six strokes of the cane.</p>
