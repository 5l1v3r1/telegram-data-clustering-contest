      <h1>Too little sleep can be bad for women’s bone density</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:23:50+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author">David Hill-Buffalo</a></address>
      <p>Getting five or fewer hours of sleep a night is associated with low bone mineral density and higher odds of osteoporosis, researchers report.</p>
      <p>“Our study suggests that sleep may negatively impact bone health, adding to the list of the negative health impacts of poor sleep,” says lead author Heather Ochs-Balcom, associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions.</p>
      <p>“I hope that it can also serve as a reminder to strive for the recommended seven or more hours of sleep per night for our physical and mental health.”</p>
      <p>The study, published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jbmr.3879"><i>Journal of Bone and Mineral Research</i></a>, focused on 11,084 postmenopausal US women from the Women’s Health Initiative. Women who self-reported sleeping five hours or less per night had significantly lower <a href="https://www.futurity.org/spop-protein-hedgehog-bone-1314762-2/">bone mineral density</a> at four sites—whole body, hip, neck, and spine—compared to women who slept seven hours a night, a difference equivalent to one year of aging.</p>
      <p>Researchers note there was no statistical difference among women who slept more than seven hours.</p>
      <p>The body undergoes an array of healthy processes during <a href="https://www.futurity.org/microglia-sleep-brain-immune-system-2189652/">sleep</a>, including bone remodeling, during which old tissue is removed and new bone tissue forms.</p>
      <p>“There’s a rhythm throughout the day. If you are sleeping less, one possible explanation is that bone remodeling isn’t happening properly,” Ochs-Balcom says.</p>
      <p>The current study follows research the team published last year that found that women who had short sleep had higher likelihood of sustaining a fracture.</p>
      <p>“The question was, is it because they’re up and walking around more, or because they really have lower bone mineral density?” Ochs-Balcom says. “I said why don’t we take a look at it because we have a sample of BMD scans from 11,000 women. This helps tell more of the story.”</p>
      <p>While the findings might be the stuff of nightmares for older adults, the silver lining is that sleep is something people can control, along with adding in a few extra healthy behaviors.</p>
      <p>Poor sleep is linked to a number of adverse health conditions, including <a href="https://www.futurity.org/sleepy-obesity-childrens-health-1731952/">obesity</a>, diabetes, hypertension, and <a href="https://www.futurity.org/bad-nights-sleep-blood-pressure-cardiovascular-disease-2079332-2/">cardiovascular disease</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s really important to eat healthy, and physical activity is important for bone health,” Ochs-Balcom says. “That’s the exciting part of this story—most of us have control over when we turn off the lights, when we put the phone down.”</p>
