      <p>One shocked dogwalker described on social media how she felt “uneasy” when walking past the creep who she said was staring at her and “behaving strangely”.</p>
      <p>The Facebook user who alerted locals to his actions wrote: “I walked for maybe 5 minutes and clocked a man standing down the bank to my left, stood still and staring up at me.</p>
      <p>“I stopped and went to let him carry on ahead but he didn’t.</p>
      <p>“He just stood staring at me, so I stared back at him so he didn’t think I was intimidated.</p>
      <p>“We had a weird stare-off, before he shuffled on into the trees. He was walking very slowly and behaving very strangely.</p>
      <p>“I felt really uneasy about carrying on since he’d just disappeared into the trees.”</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “About 1.27pm on Friday 15 November 2019 a report was received relating to a man indecently exposing himself in the Queens Park in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“The man is described as being Asian in appearance, in his mid to late 30s, medium to large build and was wearing dark clothing and a black baseball cap.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who was in the area of the park and saw or heard anything suspicious is asked to call police on the 101 number quoting the reference 1661 November 15 2019.”</p>
