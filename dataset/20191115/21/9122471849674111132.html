      <p>On Thursday night, a match-up between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers turned ugly in the final seconds of Cleveland’s 21-7 win.</p>
      <p>Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph dumped off a pass to running back Trey Edmunds when he was tackled by Browns defensive end Myles Garrett. Rudolph and Garrett then tussled on the ground before Garrett ripped the helmet off of <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/video-myles-garrett-ejected-after-swinging-helmet-at-mason-rudolph">Rudolph and then hit him with it</a>.</p>
      <p>One analyst called out Browns fans for what they said about Garrett’s role in the fracas.</p>
      <p>During his show on Friday, Colin Cowherd took time to call out Browns fans who defended Garrett’s actions.</p>
      <p>“Stop defending Myles Garrett. Ohio, get off the internet. You’ve embarrassed yourself long enough in the league for your play. Stop embarrassing yourself for defending Myles Garrett,” Cowherd said on his show.</p>
      <p>Here are his full comments.</p>

      <p>The NFL didn’t wait long to suspended several players involved. On Friday morning, the league announced suspensions for three players involved in the melee.</p>
      <p>Garrett received an indefinite suspension , meaning he’s out for at least the rest of the 2019 season, including the playoffs. Fellow Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi received a one-game suspension.</p>
      <p>As for the Steelers, offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey received a three-game suspension for punching and kicking Garrett. Rudolph received a fine for his role.</p>
