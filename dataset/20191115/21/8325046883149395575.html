      <p>To help you narrow down your options, Insider asked Jeremy Gallman, an interior designer and retail associate at <a href="https://magnoliainspiringinteriors.com/">Magnolia Inspiring Interiors</a> in Tampa, Florida, for his top picks.</p>

      <p>Gallman said stockings are the “classic ornament of the holiday season,” not just something to hang on a mantle.</p>
      <p>He suggests buying a few extra to use as a wine bag for holiday parties or as a way to quickly wrap gifts.</p>

      <p>Gallman said customizing a set of these clear, paintable ornaments is a fun present idea.</p>
      <p>“You can paint whatever you want on these, and even fill with small mementos to create one-of-a-kind gifts,” he added.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Gallman told Insider he recommends artificial garland because the real stuff can be costly and difficult to maintain since the needles can fall off and make a mess.</p>
      <p>“Artificial garland is a great alternative to the real thing,” he said. “And, by massing multiple strands together and mixing in some fresh pine cones and berry garland, you can create a beautiful custom look.”</p>
