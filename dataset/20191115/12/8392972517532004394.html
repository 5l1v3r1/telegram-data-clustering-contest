      <p>A healthier take on treats such as the Terry's Chocolate Orange – but with the same festive taste – it appears fans can't get enough of the cereal relaunch.</p>

      <p>The 500g box costs £2 – but we must stress they're only available while stocks last!</p>
      <p>And even then, the cereals are set to go off sale on December 4.</p>
      <p>It might just be time to stockpile… The last time they were on sale was 2012!</p>
