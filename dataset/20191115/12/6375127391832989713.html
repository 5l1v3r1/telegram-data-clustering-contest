      <h3>NEWLY-MINTED season MVP Calvin Oftana powered San Beda to a 79-76 win over Letran to send the NCAA men's basketball championship to a deciding game last night before 18,407 fans at the Mall of Asia Arena.</h3>
      <p>When the chips were down, the Red Lions turned to Oftana to keep their dynasty alive.</p>
      <p>San Beda regained the driver's seat, 77-76, after Oftana  converted a three-point play with 19.1 seconds left.</p>
      <p>The Knights tried to put a storybook ending to their season, but Bonbon Batiller, receiving a pass from Jerrick Balanza, muffed a lay-up as the ball seemed to have slipped away from his hands.</p>
      <p>James Canlas then sealed the deal for the Lions with two free throws to close out the thrilling contest.</p>
      <p>The winner-take-all Game 3 is set at 4 p.m. on Tuesday at the same Pasay venue.</p>
      <p>Instead of becoming the second team after 2017 Lyceum of the Philippines squad to fail to clinch the throne after completing a 18-0 elimination round sweep, San Beda will have a chance to clinch its fourth straight crown, and the 23rd overall.</p>
      <p>Letran, for its part, hopes to shrug off the painful endgame as it tries to annex its championship banner No. 18.</p>
      <p>History is still on the Knights' side, as the previous 13 champions all won Game 1 of the Finals.</p>
      <p>Larry Muyang hit a fadeaway jumper off Kenmark Cariño to give Letran a 76-74 lead with 55.4 seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>Oftana scored on a putback that capped the Lions' telling 13-0 run for a 72-66 advantage with 3:51 left.</p>
      <p>But the Knights countered with their own 8-0 run for a 74-72 lead courtesy of Muyang's two free throws.   </p>
      <p>Fran Yu, continuing his solid post-elimination round play  beat the buzzer, an off-balanced jumper that gave Letran a 55-53 at the end of the third period.</p>
      <p>In its the first do-or-die game since Game 3 of the championship against Letran on October 29, 2015, San Beda, stung by its shock 64-65 series-opening loss, played with a sense of urgency.</p>
      <p>The Lions roared to a 15-0 start at the 6:04 mark and posted an 18-7 lead at the end of first period.</p>
      <p>San Beda was still up, 37-25, at the half before Letran made a huge fightback at the start of second half, taking the lead for the first time at 44-41 after Muyang completed a three-point play.</p>
      <p>In the juniors division, McLaude Guadaña shot 19 points as Lyceum of the Philippines University lived another day with a 79-74 win over San Beda.  The Finals decider is set on Tuesday.  </p>
      <p>The scores:</p>
      <p>San Beda (79) -- Canlas 21, Oftana 17, Doliguez 17, Cariño 7, Nelle 5, Soberano 5, Cuntapay 3, Tankoua 2, Abuda 2, Bahio 0, Noah 0,</p>
      <p>Letran (76) -- Yu 23, Muyang 17, Batiller 11, Ambohot 9, Balanza 9, Caralipio 7, Olivario 0, Ular 0, Mina 0, Reyson 0, Balagasay 0, Sangalang 0.</p>
      <p>Quarterscores: 18-7, 37-25, 53-56, 79-76</p>
