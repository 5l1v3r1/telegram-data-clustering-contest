      <h2>Armed Russian military police flies into the Syrian airbase in Aleppo near the border with Turkey</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:44:02+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968129" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Russia landed attack helicopters and troops at a sprawling air base in northern Syria vacated by U.S. forces, the Russian Defense Ministry's Zvezda TV channel said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Armed Russian military police were shown in footage aired on Zvezda flying into the Syrian air base in northern Aleppo province near the border with Turkey and fanning out to secure the area.</p>
      <p>The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/defying-pentagon-trump-turkey-erdogan-syria-u-s-backed-kurds-1.7950055">ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops</a> from parts of Syria last month.</p>
      <p>The facility will be used as a center to distribute humanitarian aid for local residents and the military aerodrome is now controlled by Syrian government forces allied with Moscow, Zvezda said.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/russia-sets-up-helicopter-base-in-northern-syria-weeks-after-u-s-withdrawal-1.8126653">Zvezda said Russia had set up a helicopter base</a> at an airport in the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli, a move designed to increase Moscow's control over events on the ground there.</p>
