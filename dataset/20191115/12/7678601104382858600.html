      <h1>Oscar-winner Mo'Nique sues Netflix for pay discrimination</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:32:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author">The Jakarta Post</a></address>
      <p>Oscar-winning actress Mo'Nique on Thursday filed a pay discrimination lawsuit against Netflix, alleging the streaming giant offered her less money than it did to white and male performers because she is a black woman.</p>
      <p>Mo'Nique, also a singer and comedian, said in the lawsuit that a proposed $500,000 fee from Netflix in 2018 to make a stand-up comedy special was a "discriminatory low-ball offer".</p>
      <p>"I had a choice to make: I could accept what I felt was pay discrimination or I could stand up for those who came before me and those who will come after me," she said in an Instagram post.</p>

      <p>"I chose to stand up."</p>
      <p>Netflix strongly denied the allegation.</p>
      <p>"We care deeply about inclusion, equity, and diversity and take any accusations of discrimination very seriously," a spokesperson told AFP.</p>
      <p>"We believe our opening offer to Mo'Nique was fair -- which is why we will be fighting this lawsuit."</p>

      <p>Mo'Nique, 51, whose real name is Monique Hicks, won the best supporting actress Academy Award for her portrayal of an abusive mother in 2009's <i>Precious</i>.</p>
      <p>That same year she began hosting her own talk show. It was canceled in 2011.</p>
      <p>Her last film was 2016's <i>Almost Christmas</i>,Â according to IMDB.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit, filed at a Los Angeles court Thursday, said the offer "perpetuated the pay gap suffered by black women".</p>
      <p>"There apparently is a ceiling when it comes to Netflix's willingness to pay talent of certain demographics, namely, black women," it said.</p>
      <p>The document referred to higher offers reportedly made to male comedians by Netflix, including Jerry Seinfeld, Eddie Murphy and Ricky Gervais.</p>
