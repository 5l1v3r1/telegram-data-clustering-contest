      <h1>T Sakhi's Lebanon pavilion uses walls to activate social interaction</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:41:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/natashah-hitti/" target="_blank">Natashah Hitti</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/beirut/">Beirut</a> studio T Sakhi redefined the wall as a hub for social connection with its pavilion for <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/dubai-design-week/">Dubai Design Week</a>, which comments on the "resilience" of <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/lebanon/">Lebanese</a> society in the face of current socio-political unrest.</p>
      <p>Sisters Tessa and Tara Sakhi from architecture and design studio <a href="https://www.tsakhi.com/">T Sakhi</a> were commissioned to create a pavilion for this year's edition of <a href="https://www.dubaidesignweek.ae/">Dubai Design Week</a> that would represent their Lebanese culture.</p>
      <p>The result is the WAL(L)TZ installation – a 15-metre linear wall made from recyclable foam that has been penetrated with various openings and cracks that visitors can use to communicate with one another.</p>

      <p>WAL(L)TZ was chiefly intended as a comment on the socio-political unrest in Lebanon, which according to the sisters has recently seen ongoing protests against government corruption and the structure of the political system.</p>
      <p>The Sakhi sisters wanted to respond to the myriad of walls embedded in Lebanon's urban infrastructure, such as security barriers, barbed wires and fenced public spaces.</p>
      <p>Small holes and narrow slits in the wall are designed to encourage visitors to interact by touching, holding hands, looking at each other and moving through or over the wall.</p>

      <p>"When Dubai Design Week asked us to design a Lebanon pavilion, the first thing that came to our minds was all the obstacles we encounter on a daily basis in our country, whether political, economic, social or religious," the duo told Dezeen.</p>
      <p>"As we are witnessing today the biggest Lebanese revolution in history, we can see a society that has put aside all its religious, cultural and political affiliations and beliefs to unite under one nation and one Lebanese flag," they continued.</p>
      <p>"These obstacles are as likely to be physical as psychological," the designers explained. "Physical, because we cannot move freely in our country – one crammed with military barricades – and psychological, because we all wear social 'shields' or 'masks' as we engage and interact with one another."</p>

      <p>As the designers explain, each visitor becomes a performer in a "choreographed protest" against oppression when interacting with the wall and other people through it. Tessa and Tara describe this as a "reinterpreted waltz", which gives the pavilion its name.</p>
      <p>"It is all a question of how much you want to push yourself to go to the other side of the wall," they said.</p>

      <p>The material of choice was foam as, firstly, it can be easily recycled, and secondly it is lightweight and porous – qualities that directly contrast to the rigidity and solidness of the concrete typically used to build walls.</p>
      <p>This, according to T Sakhi, was to make it playful and for both kids and adults to touch, feel, and even remove pieces from it.</p>

      <p>While WAL(L)TZ directly addresses the ongoing uprising in Lebanon, it also speaks more universally to the barriers faced by our current generation, the designers explained, which is dominated by technology.</p>
      <p>The concept was born in response to the questions the Sakhi sisters found themselves asking, such as "How do we interact in today's world?" and "Are we intimate strangers?"</p>

      <p>Placing iPads and mirrors in some of the holes was the designers' way of addressing our current, global "technological era" in a playful and satirical manner.</p>
      <p>These items represent the virtual interaction between individuals that is made via screens, as a hint towards the "self-absorption of today's society".</p>

      <p>The pavilion was designed as part of Abwab – the annual exhibition that takes part during Dubai Design Week dedicated to commissioning work from across the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia in a bid to promote design talent from the region.</p>
      <p>On display from 11 to 16 November 2019, WAL(L)TZ is one of this year's three national pavilions, which were all created in response to this year's theme of "ways of learning".</p>

      <p>The Lebanon pavilion wall is a continuation of the studio's previous installations, which also tackle the concepts of interaction and connectivity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/06/07/t-sakhi-beirut-seating-design/">Lost in Translation and Holidays in the Sun</a> were two installations in Beirut that saw security barriers transformed into seating structures that encourage people to sit face to face.</p>
