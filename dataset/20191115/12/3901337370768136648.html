      <p>Kane netted his third international hat-trick in England's 7-0 2020 UEFA European Championship win over Montenegro this week.</p>
      <p>The Tottenham Hotspur star has now scored 31 goals for England, which sees him climb to sixth place in the nation's all-time top goalscorers list, despite having only 44 international caps to his name.</p>
      <p>Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney currently occupies the top spot with 53 goals, ahead of 1966 FIFA World Cup winner Sir Bobby Charlton, who netted 49 times for the Three Lions.</p>

      <p>Kane's goal return for England has come at an average of 0.70 goals per game, which is better than both Rooney and Charlton's and, according to <i>Football London</i>, if maintained, would see him break the former's all-time record within 33 matches (or in his 77th international appearance).</p>
      <p>Comparatively, Rooney achieved his record in 120 appearances for England, while Charlton's haul came in 109 matches.</p>
