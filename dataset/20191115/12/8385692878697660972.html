      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/oneplus">OnePlus</a> has <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-10-0-4-for-oneplus-7t-pro.1139808/">started pushing out</a> a new update to the OnePlus 7T Pro, OxygenOS 10.0.4. This update follows the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/oxygenos-10-0-6-for-the-oneplus-7t-improves-battery-life-more.html">OxygenOS 10.0.6 update</a> for the OnePlus 7T which landed yesterday.</p>
      <p>Those of you who own the OnePlus 7T Pro will be glad to hear that OxygenOS 10.0.4 brings the Android security patch for October. This update also brings various optimizations to the device, according to the changelog.</p>
      <h3>OxygenOS 10.0.4 for the OnePlus 7T Pro improves standby power consumption</h3>
      <p>OnePlus has optimized the standby power consumption. In other words, your OnePlus 7T Pro should last longer when you're not using it, it should drain less battery.</p>

      <p>The company has also fixed the black bar issue while charging or playing video. This has been one of the more requested fixes by the OnePlus 7T Pro users up until now.</p>
      <p>Bluetooth connectivity in automobiles has also been optimized, says the company, and the same goes for the expanded screenshot feature. The OnePlus 7T users were also having issues with the expanded screenshot feature, and OnePlus fixed those for both phones with the latest updates.</p>
      <p>On top of everything we've mentioned, OnePlus also says that it improved system stability and squashed various bugs. That is a standard addition to the changelog of every update, pretty much.</p>

      <h3>This update will be rolling out gradually</h3>
      <p>This update will not roll out to everyone straight away. It will roll out to a limited number of users first, and will then be released to everyone. This is something OnePlus users are already used to by now.</p>
      <p>OnePlus is trying to avoid any new bugs by doing this. If it notices any new bugs during the limited rollout, it will halt the update until it fixes everything.</p>
      <p>If everything goes according to plan, this update should become available to everyone within a week or so.</p>

      <p>The OnePlus 7T Pro was announced last month. The device is not available in the US, unlike the OnePlus 7T. The company is selling the OnePlus 7 Pro in the states, though, and the 7T Pro is not a huge improvement over that device.</p>
      <p>The OnePlus 7T Pro actually looks the same as the 7 Pro. The device is made out of metal, and it comes with a curved display. Its bezels are really thin, and it includes a pop-up selfie camera.</p>
      <p>The Snapdragon 855 Plus fuels this smartphone, while the device features three cameras on the back. Android 10 comes out of the box, along with OxygenOS 10.</p>
