      <p>There are now just days to go until the return of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, bit before the new series has even started, bookies have named their favourite to win.</p>
      <p>It's hard to believe that it's been 17 years since <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> first hit our screens, with Tony Blackburn the ITV show's first ever winner.</p>
      <p>Since then the likes of Kerry Katona, Dougie Poynter, Christopher Biggins, Vicky Pattison and Scarlett Moffatt have all triumphed in the jungle and before long, we now know who'll be following in their footsteps this year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-lineup-confirmed-16118148">I'm A Celebrity line-up</a> for this year includes Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle, GMB host Kate Garraway and Radio DJ Adele Roberts who has a reality TV past.</p>
      <p>But none of them are the bookies hot tip to win. As things stand, they are tipping football legend Ian Wright to take the jungle crown this year, with the former Arsenal and England striker's odds as short as 5/2.</p>
      <p>The current I'm A Celebrity winner odds in full, according to <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet/en-gb/betting/t/4761/I-m-A-Celebrity...Get-Me-Out-Of-Here%21.html">William Hill</a> are:</p>
      <p>5/2 Ian Wright</p>
      <p>9/2 James Haskell</p>
      <p>5/1 Roman Kemp,</p>
      <p>7/1 Jacqueline Jossa</p>
      <p>9/1 Caitlyn Jenner</p>
      <p>11/1 Kate Garraway</p>
      <p>12/1 Myles Stephenson</p>
      <p>14/1 Nadine Coyle</p>
      <p>18/1 Andrew Maxwell</p>
      <p>25/1 Adele Roberts</p>
