      <h1>IPL 2020: CSK releases Billings, Mohit; frees Rs 14.56 cr in auction budget</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:05:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:05</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Three-time IPL champions <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chennai-super-kings">Chennai Super Kings </a>on Friday released England cricketers Sam Billings and David Willey besides three Indian players ahead of next month's auction.</p>
      <p>The team announced on Twitter the decision to release wicketkeeper-batsman Billings and all-rounder Willey along with former World Cupper Mohit Sharma, Dhruv Shorey and Chaitanya Bishnoi.</p>
      <p>CSK goes into the December 19 auction with an available purse of Rs 14.6 crore.</p>
      <p>Willey had missed the 2019 IPL due to personal reasons as he and his wife were expecting their second child. Since it was not an injury, the team couldn't get a replacement for the Yorkshire man.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old had joined the team as a replacement player in 2018 and featured in three matches.</p>
      <p>Billings also had been part of the squad in the past two seasons. He had played ten games in MS Dhoni-led CSK's title-winning run in 2018 including a match-winning 56 against Kolkata Knight Riders at the M A Chidambaram stadium here.</p>
      <p>Shorey played a solitary match in the 2019 season while Bishnoi did not get to play.</p>
      <p>Mohit too was confined to the bench with the emergence of Deepak Chahar as a key bowler for CSK during the run to the final last season.</p>
