      <h1>2020 Ferrari Roma joins the prancing horse stable</h1>
      <h2>2020 Ferrari Roma is the Pransing Horse's latest front-engined sports coupe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:35:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>There was a time that most Ferraris had their engines placed in the middle (i.e. rear of the cabin) of the car itself. From the 360 Modena (or Spider), 488 and 458, as well as the much-loved F40, F50 and Enzo, the Prancing Horse chose this engine orientation more than the traditional front-engine layout.</p>
      <p>But it looks like times are changing at Ferrari as they recently unveiled another front-engine coupe. Aside from the 812 Superfast, GTC4 Lusso and the Portofino, Ferrari's latest addition to their stable is the all-new Roma, and it too has its engine placed in front of the cockpit.</p>

      <p>Blending 'clean and symbiotic forms of design', Ferrari's newest coupe features a simple yet elegant design while still keeping the signature long hood, short deck design. Taking inspiration from the classic 250 GT Berlinetta and the 250 GT 2+2, the Roma gets a somewhat retro-modern look that is highlighted by clean lines and sleek shapes.</p>
      <p>The front fascia is unlike anything Ferrari has ever designed with its unique front grill, and eye-catching headlights. It also has a front splitter and a lower air intake with a mesh covering. Complementing its smooth shape are the muscular fenders, and the swooping A-pillars that directly lead towards the fastback rear. Instead of the traditional circular taillights, Ferrari opted to give the Roma thin LEDs at the back which give it a more futuristic element.</p>

      <p>Like the exterior, the cabin of the Roma features a distinct finish. With a dual cockpit design, the driver and front passenger are separated by a large center console, allowing each one to have their own space. The driver is treated to a fully-digital 16-inch instrument panel, a flat-bottomed steering wheel complete with a wide array of buttons, as well as a touch panel for controlling the Roma's lights. Meanwhile, the passenger's side has its own touchscreen for controlling the infotainment system, climate control, and even the ventilation for the seat.</p>
      <p>Sitting at the center of it all is a tablet-inspried 8.4-inch touchscreen which can control the multimedia system and the automatic climate control. It also houses the power window switches as well as buttons for the hands-free device. Heaps of leather and Alcantara also blanket the interior of the new Roma.</p>

      <p>At the heart of the 2020 Roma is the familiar 3.9-liter twin-turbo V8. It cranks out a healthy 620 PS at 5750 – 7500 rpm, along with a meaty 760 Nm of torque at 3000 – 5750 rpm. Power is then sent to an eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox. This allows the Roma to sprint from 0 – 100 km/h in as little as 3.4 seconds, and achieve a 0 – 200 km/h run in just 9.3 seconds. Top speed is rated at over 320 km/h.</p>
