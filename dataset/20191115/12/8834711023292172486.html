      <h1>Sacca Questions Government’s Silence Amid SAA Strike</h1>

      <p>The South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) has questioned government’s silence amid a crippling strike at an already cash-strapped South African Airways (SAA).</p>
      <p>Sacca and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) have agreed to meet with South African Airways at the CCMA on Saturday in a bid to resolve the industrial action.</p>
      <p>Unions have blamed government and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan for failing to intervene to rescue the state-owned entity.</p>
      <p>Sacca president Zazi Sibanyoni-Mugambi said government must not distance itself from the financial troubles at SAA.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want a situation, come Sunday, where no intervention comes from government. It’s time, I think. We have spoken, and we don’t want to bully, we want to talk.”</p>
      <p>The South African Federation of Trade Unions’ Zwelinzima Vavi said it seemed government was using the strike to motivate for private funding for SAA.</p>
      <p>“So that the private sector uses the service, in every way, as an institution to increase levels of profit so that they can get much more richer.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, cabin crew and SAA technical workers affiliated to Numsa and Sacca were still picketing at the employer’s headquarters in Kempton Park.</p>
