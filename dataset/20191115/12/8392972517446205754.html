      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> have paid tribute to "iconic" and "legendary" character Mel Owen after her shock death last night.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night (November 14), Mel died a violent death after walking into the path of a lorry believing she about to be reunited with her <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-blunder-hunter-owen-dead-jack/">deceased son Hunter</a>.</p>

      <p>And those watching from home were blown away by the dramatic scenes, which marked the end of an era for the Owen family.</p>
      <p>Lamenting Mel's demise on Twitter, one fan wrote: "Mel Owen really was one of the most iconic characters in EastEnders history and I can't believe she's gone.</p>
      <p>"The Square won't be the same without her causing chaos and looking good doing it."</p>

      <p>Another said: "Hi Tamzin. I have just watched your last episode of EastEnders, and you were amazing. Mel and son Hunter will be together forever. You're an amazing actress and woman. All the best. Love Mel Owen."</p>
      <p>A third added: "Just want to say how much you'll be missed on EastEnders as Mel Owen @mouthwaite. What a shocker tonight that Mel died! You are such a legend and you have portrayed Mel Owen's character so brilliantly! You'll be deeply missed on EastEnders."</p>
      <aside>Mel Owen really was one of the most iconic characters in EastEnders history and I can't believe she's gone.</aside>
      <p>"Farewell Mel Owen," sad one more. "It's been pleasure watching you comeback Tamzin as Mel with fantastic performances, amazing storylines and an incredible dramatic exit. Good luck for the future, going to miss you on the show."</p>
      <p>Many others called her "queen", "legendary" and "iconic".</p>

      <p>EastEnders also paid tribute to the character, played by actress Tamzin Outhwaite, sharing her best moments alongside the message: "Last night, we lost Mel Owen. A much loved Walford resident. She will be so missed. Take a look back at some of her best moments in Albert Square… #EastEnders @mouthwaite."</p>
      <p>After a high speed chase between Mel and Sharon, viewers were horrified when Mel's car ploughed into the back of another car and rolled over.</p>
      <p>Sharon managed to get Mel out of the wreckage after spotting it was on fire and about to explode.</p>
      <p>While Sharon was trying to help, Mel kept 'hearing' her deceased son Hunter calling her name.</p>
      <p>Once Sharon managed to pull Mel from the wreckage, the car exploded.</p>

      <p>Although it looked like everyone had survived, Mel told Sharon when she was in the car she could hear and see Hunter.</p>
      <p>Sharon tried to convince the businesswoman that her mind was playing tricks on her, but Mel was adamant about Hunter being in the car and began walking back to the wreckage.</p>
      <p>As she walked back, she went straight into the path of an oncoming lorry.</p>
      <p>A short while later, viewers saw Mel's body being covered and Albert Square residents were informed that Mel had died.</p>
