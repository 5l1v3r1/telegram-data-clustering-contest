      <h3>Zakk Wylde: my playlist - "I guess Smoke On The Water is the one universal riff that we all know"</h3>
      <p>
        <b>The Ozzy Osbourne/Black Label Society six-stringer reveals the soundtrack to his journey…</b>
      </p>
      <h4>The first song I remember… Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - Elton John</h4>

      <p>“I saw him on The Sonny And Cher Show, probably around 1975. This was the first thing to make me realise the power of music. Early Elton was a lethal combination of everything – the songwriting, the musicians involved and then the production of it all. Even today, it still sounds amazing. </p>
      <p>"It all started from there for me, afterwards came all the Sabbath and heavier stuff, which is when I started taking lessons…”</p>
      <h4>The first song I learned to play… Hey Joe - Jimi Hendrix</h4>

      <p>“It was probably something really basic on one string to begin with. When I started taking guitar lessons the first songs I learned were Hey Joe and after that Tangerine by Led Zeppelin. </p>
      <p>"Every musician goes on a journey, we all have this point after our formative years where all the magic starts happening. Guitar techniques are a bit like soccer or any sport. You learn how to kick a ball, then how to make curve and all the other tricks. We all start from the same point. The only thing that matters is putting in the work!”</p>
      <h4>The riff I wish I had written… Smoke On The Water - Deep Purple</h4>

      <p>“There are so many songs with memorable riffs that you wish you could have written for the publishing alone ha ha! I guess Smoke On The Water is the one universal riff that we all know. </p>
      <p>"I would use the royalties to buy more razors so I can shave my legs. That way I won’t need to spend as much on fishnets and garters while I’m out partying. I really blast through those things and end up with quite the bill.”</p>
      <h4>The song I tried to learn that I just couldn’t nail... Letters Of Marque - Allan Holdsworth</h4>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aB_OfKDEylg" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>“He’s number one for ‘impossible’ stuff. Allan’s solos were in a language all of their own. Even when you are watching a video of him doing it, what you hear remains unbelievable and mind-boggling. </p>
      <p>"It doesn’t even matter which song you pick, they’re all completely alien to the rest of us guitar players, but I guess the first album I had was I.O.U. so it would’ve been songs like Letters Of Marque that terrified me!”</p>
      <h4>The song that reminds me of home... Never Say Die - Black Sabbath</h4>
      <p>“For some reason, this is the song that always takes me back to New Jersey. The later Ozzy-era albums like Never Say Die! and Technical Ecstasy are their dark-horse records. They might be underrated in ways, but I still love them.”</p>

      <h4>The greatest example of how powerful a guitar solo can be… Stairway To Heaven - Led Zeppelin</h4>
      <figure>

      <p>“With Ozzy, I play solos that Tony Iommi, Jake E. Lee or Randy Rhoads wrote. I play them as written, because they make a statement within the song. </p>
      <p>"The solo in Stairway is as much a part of the song as the main melody and lyrics. It’s like that for all great solos… Hotel California is the same.”</p>
      <h4>The last song I listened to… Mint Condition - Caroline Spence</h4>
      <figure>

      <p>“There’s a mellow singer/songwriter called Caroline Spence who I like a lot. I just listened to the title track of her last record. It’s not so much about the guitar. The production’s sparse around her killer voice.”</p>
