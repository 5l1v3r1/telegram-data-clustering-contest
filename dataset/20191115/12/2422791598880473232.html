      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo scores hat-trick to move within two goals of historic landmark</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:50:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Church, CNN</a></address>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is now just two goals shy of reaching an astonishing century after the superstar netted yet another hat-trick in Portugal's 6-0 demolition of Lithuania Thursday.</p>
      <p>The forward's treble ensured his side is now just one win away from Euro 2020 qualification, which it can secure against Luxembourg Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, who has now scored 98 goals for his country, will also have the chance to become only the second man in history to reach 100 international goals.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old needs just 11 more to reach the world record of 109 goals, held by legendary Iran striker Ali Daei.</p>
      <p>His latest hat-trick was his ninth in a Portugal shirt and he showed no signs of the knee problems seemingly hampering his playing time at Juventus in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Having scored the opener from the penalty spot, Ronaldo doubled his tally with a trademark strike for distance before completing his treble with a finish from within the box.</p>
      <p>"I never had any doubts about his condition, it was other people who had them. Nothing surprises me about Cristiano," said Portugal manager Fernando Santos, speaking of Ronaldo's fitness.</p>
      <p>Bernardo Silva was also on the score sheet after a week to forget -- the Manchester City forward was suspended and fined for a "racist" tweet about teammate Benjamin Mendy.</p>
      <p>Afonso Fernandes and Mendes Paciencia scored the game's other goals.</p>

        <b>England win marred by boos</b>
      </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, England secured its place at Euro 2020 with a dominating display against Montenegro in its 1000th international game.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate's side certainly put on a show at Wembley, with captain Harry Kane scoring a first half hat-trick to help England on its way to a 7-0 win.</p>
      <p>Marcus Rashford, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Tammy Abraham all added to an unfortunate own goal to complete a successful night for the Three Lions.</p>
      <p>However, the shine was somewhat taken off the night after pockets of fans booed Joe Gomez as the youngster came on as a substitute in the second half.</p>
      <p>The defender had been involved in a row with Raheem Sterling earlier in the week, with the Manchester City forward being dropped for the game as a result.</p>
      <p>However Sterling, who watched on from the stands, clapped his teammate onto the pitch and took to social media afterward to condemn the negative reaction from the crowd.</p>
      <p>"It was hard for me to see my teammate get booed for something that was my fault," Sterling tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Joe [Gomez] hasn't done anything wrong &amp; for me to see someone who keeps his head down and work hard especially after a difficult week for him to be booed when he came on tonight was wrong."</p>
