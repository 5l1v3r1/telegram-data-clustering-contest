      <h1>Starbucks opens its biggest store ever in Chicago</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:50:42+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author">CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) — Chicago just got a major caffeine jolt from Starbucks.</p>
      <p>The coffee chain opened its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/06/business/starbucks-worlds-largest-chicago-trnd/index.html">world’s largest Roastery location</a> on Friday. The five-story location is 35,000 square feet, overtaking the Tokyo Roastery as Starbucks’ biggest location. Located in the <a href="https://www.starbucksreserve.com/en-us/locations/chicago">city’s Magnificent Mile neighborhood</a>, the new Roastery is replacing a former Crate and Barrel location. It was first announced in 2017.</p>
      <p>Starbucks said the Chicago Roastery is a tribute to the city and region, where it has nearly 800 Starbucks stores and employs more than 18,000 people. The Roastery itself has 200 employees.</p>
      <p>Roasteries are intended to be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/business/starbucks-roastery-strategy/index.html">tourist attractions</a>. They feature specialty coffees and teas, on-premise roasters and massive coffee casks where freshly roasted beans are held. They also have bars with craft cocktails and serve fancier food than a normal Starbucks location.</p>
      <p>The Chicago location has all of that and a unique design that emphasizes the building’s natural light from the massive windows. Centrally located in the store is a 56-foot steel cask that stores coffee beans. Surrounding it is the region’s first-ever curved escalator that gives customers a 360-degree view of the store.</p>
      <p>Selling coffee is a central part of the store. There are three coffee bars that offer a variety of brewing methods, including an “Experiential” coffee car that “provides customers the opportunity to immerse in the art, science, and theatre of coffee,” according to a press release.</p>
      <p>A mix of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are served at its Arriviamo Bar, <a href="https://www.starbucksreserve.com/en-us/locations/chicago/menu">along with Chicago-specific cocktails</a>. And this Roastery is the only location in the United States to sell liquid nitrogen gelato, a sweet dessert designed to be eaten with coffee. It’s also served in the Milan Roastery.</p>
      <p>Princi, which is Starbucks’ bakery and cafe concept, is also featured prominently. It offers a full menu of baked goods and heartier items, like pizza.</p>
      <p>This is Starbucks’ sixth Roastery location. The company uses the spaces test out design concepts and menu items — and to double down on its promise of offering a “third place” between home and work, even as it focuses on speed and convenience elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Starbucks has always been “a more affluent brand,” Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy previously told CNN Business. The Roasteries take it “even more upstream,” he said.</p>
      <p>Roastery joins Starbucks’ growing line of store concepts. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/business/starbucks-new-pickup-location/index.html">it opened “Starbucks Pick-Up,”</a> a first-of-its-kind location in New York that encourages orders from its app. The location is a fraction the size of its normal cafe.</p>
      <p>The Chicago Roastery will be open seven days a week.</p>
