      <h1>Rangers fans are playing the HMRC victim card but should be asking why their club never paid the bill - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Fraser Wilson takes your calls as old arguments resurface.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:53:07+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>Just as the focus in the great Glasgow football divide was turning back to the beautiful game along comes a curveball with an HMRC stamp.</p>
      <p>Allegations that the taxman boobed in calculating the tax bill which ultimately sank <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> seven years ago opened up all sorts of claims and counter claims.</p>
      <p>And had the Hotline ringing off the hook. Time to get the business heads back on then.</p>
      <p>First up <b>Scott Riach from Inverness</b> , who said: “After reading the article on Rangers EBTs in the Record, it seems they have reduced the liability on those individuals that received the illegal tax break NOT the liability to Rangers FC.</p>
      <p>“Those ex-players were being pursued independently, so to say that had this been applied a few years ago when Rangers went into liquidation and ceased to exist is wrong, Rangers got exactly what they deserved.”</p>

      <p><b>Robert Frew, Glasgow</b> , said: “Since it appears that they only cheated the system to the tune of £20million, which <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ally-mccoist">Ally McCoist</a> has described as manageable, perhaps Rangers should now put the argument to bed by actually paying the bill.”</p>
      <p>And <b>Lance Little in Erskine</b> , added: “I had a wee chuckle at the Rangers fans unwarranted anger at HMRC.</p>
      <p>“Even if a mistake has been made, which according to HMRC there wasn’t, Rangers would still have owed millions and as they were on their knees unable to pay it.</p>
      <p>“You even have some fans looking for a refund on tax bill the never paid.</p>
      <p>“Clutching at straws - they should concentrate on securing second in the league this season.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Frank McFerran, Carrickfergus</b> , is certain Rangers lost out. He said: “Would Rangers be due any money back from the HMRC? Or can they take legal action against the incompetence of these people? After all Rangers as a club lost big time.”</p>
      <p>But <b>James Brown, Glasgow</b> , argued: “Rangers fans are playing the victim card yet again about HMRC. They should be asking why their old club didn’t pay £18m and then there would have been no so called inaccurate penalties? They and they alone let their club die.”</p>
      <p>Away from tax disputes there was still plenty of football chat. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> ’ agent irked Rangers fans with his comments this morning that interested clubs should act quickly if they want to avid paying a huge fee for the Colombian.</p>

      <p><b>Drew Ferguson, Oban</b> , said: “I see Morelos’ agent has no respect for Glasgow Rangers as he wants to make a quick buck by punting his player at the earliest convenience rather than waiting for the best interests of both parties.”</p>
      <p>Scotland face a dead rubber double header - try saying that quickly - against Cyprus and Kazakhstan as they build up to a crucial Euro 2020 play-off.</p>
      <p>But supporters are fed up with the call-offs from the big names.</p>
      <p><b>Davy Matson</b> emailed: “I keep reading that players who pull out of Scotland teams will be ready for the latter stages. WHY should they get a free pass at the expense of the players who willingly showed up?</p>
      <p>“If you don’t turn up then get stuffed.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And <b>Andy Stewart from Kilwinning</b> reckons <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> can do one too.</p>
      <p>He said: “I can’t see how these players can walk away and say they are not fit. Steve Clarke has to take part of the blame and I would replace him with Scot Gemmill who is doing an excellent job with the Under 21s.</p>
      <p>“Assisted by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-mccann">Neil McCann</a> and Stuart McCall he would do a great job.</p>
      <p>“And while we are on the subject they should bring the pipes and drums back to Hampden pre-match. That’s what we used to have back in the good old days and it made the lion on the players’ chest come alive.”</p>
      <p>Finally, <b>Izzy Currie, Caithness</b> , is delighted to see Catriona Matthew selected to captain the European Solheim Cup team again.</p>
      <p>She said: “Terrific news regarding Catriona being chosen to captain the side in the USA in 2021. Her leadership qualities are outstanding and I’m sure her team will be very well prepared for the defence of their title.”</p>
