      <p>EFF leader Julius Malema has proclaimed his support for Burna Boy following major public outrage against having the Nigerian artist perform shortly after his announcement to boycott the country.</p>
      <p>"There's no mascot that can stop him from performing, he's one of our own and we will protect him," Malema tweeted on Friday.</p>
      <p>"South Africa is a home for all Africans, kill me for defending an African brother, bloody Cowards."</p>

      <p>The arrival of the Nigerian singer and songwriter, Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu, has been met with controversy after he tweeted his refusal to enter South Africa during a period of heightened xenophobic attacks.</p>
      <p>The artist, who previously collaborated with South African rapper AKA, in September made it known on Twitter that he will "not ever go to South Africa again" until government takes a stand against the xenophobic attacks which saw more than 300 Nigerians evacuating and at least 12 people dead in one week.</p>

      <p>"I have not set foot in SA since 2017. And I will NOT EVER go to South Africa again for any reason until the SOUTH AFRICAN government wakes the fuck up and really performs [a] miracle, because I don’t know how they can even possibly fix this," he tweeted.</p>

      <p>Malema came to the <i>African Giant</i> hitmaker’s defence, saying that he looks forward to his arrival in the country a week before the artist is set to perform on stage at the Africans Unite concert.</p>
      <p>However, Twitter came out headstrong against Malema, having seemingly loyal EFF supporters majorly questioning whether or not to vote for the party during the next election.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/Event.aspx?itemid=1495577256">Webtickets</a>, the event will be hosted in aid of the spate of xenophobic attacks and gender-based violence plaguing the country, in an attempt to "unify all Africans and speak out against femicide".</p>
      <p>The concert is set to take place on November 23 and 24 in Cape Town and Pretoria, respectively.</p>
      <p>Burna Boy also promoted the concert on his Twitter page, calling it "the first of many!". </p>
