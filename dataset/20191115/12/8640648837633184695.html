      <h1>Great weather expected on Sunday for Las Vegas marathon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:35:30+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/marvin-clemons/" target="_blank">Marvin Clemons</a></address>
      <p>The tens of thousands of runners in Sunday’s Rock ‘N’ Roll Marathon should have excellent weather conditions for Sunday’s race along the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
      <p>A high in the mid- to upper 70s is forecast along with clear skies and light wind conditions, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures will drop into the 60s during the race.</p>
      <p>Before Sunday, the high Friday should reach 75, and Saturday’s will be 77. Both days will have clear skies and winds up to 10 mph. The overnight lows will be in the upper 40s to low 50s.</p>
      <p>A two-month dry spell in the Las Vegas Valley could come to an end by the middle of next week, said meteorologist Trevor Boucher.</p>
      <p>“There is still some uncertainty, but there is some chance for raindrops will be late Tuesday night into Wednesday,” Boucher said. “The weather models show about a 50 percent chance of rain later Wednesday into Thursday.”</p>
      <p>The last measurable rain at McCarran International Airport was 0.24 inches on Sept. 23.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s high at McCarran was 74.</p>
