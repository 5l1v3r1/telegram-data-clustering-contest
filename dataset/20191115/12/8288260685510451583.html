      <p>Sir Rod Stewart has backed Boris Johnson on Brexit and said it would be "a shame" if Scotland became independent.</p>
      <p>However, the singer said he would support Scotland leaving the union "if it was good" for the country.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BBC Scotland's The Nine programme, Sir Rod also said he believes Boris Johnson "will sort it out", when asked about Brexit.</p>

      <p>He said: "I'm somewhat of a traditionalist. It would be a shame to see the British isles break up, it would be a shame to see that blue off the Union Jack.</p>
      <p>"But if it's good for Scotland then I'm happy."</p>
      <p>Sir Rod previously spoke out against the idea of Scottish independence ahead of the 2014 referendum, alongside a number of British celebrities.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>When asked about the current political climate, he said: "We're in a muddle, but I think Boris will sort it out.</p>
      <p>"We have to be patient.</p>
      <p>"What I do know is that I was always a remainer. I didn't see why we had to leave. Maybe it's something that I'm missing, I don't know, but I'm still a remainer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I know Boris is going to get us out."</p>
      <p>Sir Rod, who described Scotland as his "spiritual home", said the upcoming General Election is of the "utmost importance".</p>
      <p>He added: "It's a once in a lifetime, this election. I don't know what the outcome is going to be, I really don't."</p>
