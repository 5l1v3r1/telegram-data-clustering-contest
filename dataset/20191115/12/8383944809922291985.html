      <p>A Turkish scientist developed an algorithm that could potentially revolutionize marine science and underwater photography.<br/><br/>Engineer and oceanographer Derya Akkaynak created a program that removes the color distortion underwater images suffer because of how light travels through water.<br/><br/>The algorithm, which is called See-thru, "takes an underwater image and removes the water from it. And it looks just like as it would if you took the photo on land," Akkaynak told Scientific American magazine.<br/><br/>She explained that underwater photos usually have an overwhelming green or blue colorcast, while objects in the distance are backscattered.<br/><br/>See-thru uses distance information and a mathematical formula to go "through each pixel to calculate what the degradation is and removes it."<br/><br/>"I see this as the start of the artificial intelligence boom in marine science," Akkaynak predicted.</p>

      <p>She believes her algorithm would greatly help biologists and other scientists to make surveys of the seafloor or reefs, which currently is done manually.<br/><br/>Akkaynak insisted that See-thru has nothing to do with enhancing images through programs like Photoshop.<br/><br/>"It's a physically accurate correction rather than a visually pleasing modification," she said.<br/><br/>Recreational underwater photographers should also be excited over the technique, Akkaynak added, as they will finally be able to remove all the degrading components from the images they take.<br/><br/>Scientific American said Akkaynak's algorithm "could be of value to scientists trying to understand the impacts of climate change on coral and other marine systems."</p>
