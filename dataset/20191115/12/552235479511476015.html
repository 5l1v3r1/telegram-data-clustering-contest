      <h2>Officers act after another meeting is affected by ‘technical difficulties'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:41:45+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Cargill, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-cargill/</a></address>
      <p>Council officers have insisted the equipment they use to record meetings is being looked at “as a matter of urgency”, after a councillor complained their failure to record yet another meeting was “just not good enough”.</p>
      <p>Strathearn councillor Stewart Donaldson hit out after it became clear officers had failed to record the latest meeting of the council’s environment and infrastructure committee held on October 30.</p>
      <p>The committee considered 19 separate papers that day, including reports recommending members postpone work to strengthen bridges in Perth and approve proposals for flood protection schemes in Pitlochry and Aberfeldy.</p>
      <p>But officers have again said the meeting went unrecorded “due to technical and operational issues”, much like they did last month after it emerged they had failed to record a meeting of the council’s planning committee in September.</p>
      <p>Contentious plans to build a battery farm in Coupar Angus were approved during that meeting as were two linked applications from a development group seeking permission to demolish a garage in Kinross after its workers had already destroyed the building.</p>
      <p>It’s since emerged officers also failed to record a meeting of the council’s strategic policy and resources in September and only managed to record part of a meeting of the full council later that same month too.</p>
      <p>Councillor Donaldson said he was particularly annoyed about the latest failure as he has now asked questions about the same subject at two meetings in recent months and neither of them were recorded and later made available on YouTube.</p>
      <p>He said: “What I’m really annoyed about is that my questions at the [environment and infrastructure committee] about the Comrie flood prevention scheme were not recorded. I had specifically asked them as a matter of public record.</p>
      <p>“That was because my questions about the very same subject at the strategic policy and resources committee on September 11 were lost as well.</p>
      <p>“It’s just not good enough. I’m aware that there is not exactly a mass audience for council proceedings on YouTube. But it is there for the public, the press, other councillors, and various interested parties. It should be there as a matter of public record and audit.</p>
      <p>“I really did want my questions and the responses to be recorded on what is such a crucial issue for Comrie. The council just has to get this sorted, and fast.”</p>
      <p>A PKC spokesperson commented: “Unfortunately due to technical and operational issues, we do not have recordings of the environment and infrastructure Committee on October 30 and the strategic policy and resources committee on September 11.</p>
      <p>“We have been liaising closely with the suppliers of our audiovisual equipment in the chambers and their engineers regarding these issues as a matter of urgency. We share the concerns being raised by Cllr Donaldson and are seeking a permanent resolution as soon as is practicably possible.”</p>
