      <p>The isle of Rum, in the Inner Hebrides, has been monitoring its red deer population since 1972 – and Kilmory beach, an unspoilt stretch of white sand on Rum’s northern coastline, with breathtaking views of the Skye Cuillins, is at the heart of this long-term study. The Guardian photographer Murdo MacLeod spent a few days with the project workers last summer. In this wild, rugged part of Scotland, red deer outnumber people by about 30 to one: the research project has become one of the longest and most complete scientific studies of a wild population of animals anywhere in the world.</p>
