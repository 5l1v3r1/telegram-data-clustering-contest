      <p>Due to the increasing population in Uganda, the right way to go is constructing condominiums all over the country in order to reduce on the rampant land wrangles.<br/><br/>Eng. Kenneth Kaijuka, the chief Executive officer of National Housing and Construction Company Limited said currently, the population is rapidly increasing yet land has remained static hence forcing people to scramble for it.<br/><br/>However, he advised the government and general public to embrace the condominium setting as one of the ways of solving land disputes.<br/><br/>“A condominium ranges from sh200m to sh400m depending on the size and location of a unit,” he stated.<br/><br/>Kaijuka explained that a condominium is a group of housing units where homeowners have individual unit space and each is given a title for their unit(s).<br/><br/>“With this kind of setting, homeowners share common areas like car parking, compound among others,” he added.<br/><br/>Kaijuka made the remarks at a press conference to launch the homes and property expo on Thursday in Kampala.<br/><br/>The expo’s organiser Edwin Musiime encouraged the youth to invest in a home because it is a life time investment.<br/><br/>“Instead of buying in expensive phones, cars and clothes, divert that money to build or buying yourself a home,” he advised.<br/><br/>He said that the expo will show case different types of house designs which, properties in Dubai and garden items like plants, planters and decorative pieces among others. <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> </p>
