      <h1>House Ethics Committee discloses 2 very different investigations of Florida congressmen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:47:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/authors/peter-weber" target="_blank">Peter Weber</a></address>
      <p>The House Ethics Committee disclosed Thursday that two Florida congressmen, Rep. Alcee Hastings (D) and Rep. Ross Spano (R), are under investigation. Hastings, who has been in the House for 26 years, is being investigated by the Ethics Committee <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/14/alcee-hastings-ethics-probe-071021">for his long-term relationship</a> with a member of his staff, Patricia Williams. Former Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) resigned last month after denying she had an intimate relationship with a member of her staff while admitting she had such a relationship with a campaign staffer.</p>
      <p>Williams has been on Hastings' staff since 2000, and they bought a house together in 2017, the <i>Palm Beach Post</i> reports. He downplayed any impropriety this fall, telling the <i>Post</i>, "However it looks, it's been looking like that for 25 years."</p>
      <p>With Spano, the House Ethics Committee <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/press-release/statement-chairman-and-ranking-member-committee-ethics-regarding-representative-ross-0">announced</a> it is deferring its investigation at the request of the Justice Department, which, the committee revealed, has opened a criminal investigation into possible campaign finance violations. Spano claimed last year that he loaned his campaign $175,000 from personal funds when in fact he had received $180,000 in loans from personal friends, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/14/doj-investigating-gop-rep-ross-spano-over-alleged-campaign-finance-violations-070998"><i>Politico</i> reports</a>. Spano's lawyer informed the Federal Election Commission of the erroneous campaign finance report soon after Spano won the race.</p>
      <p>"Today, the House Committee on Ethics deferred their review of my self-reported filings with the FEC," Spano said in a statement. "We plan to cooperate fully with the Justice Department on this matter."</p>
