So, when Christmas comes around, get your crazy cat friend or your pooch freak family member something for their better halves. They'll probably enjoy it more than a gift for themselves anyway.</p>

      <p>Getting more data about your dog is what every good dog obsessive wants. How many zoomies does my dog do? When does my dog wake up and go to sleep? The DOTT Smart Dog Tag is your answer.</p>
      <p>This smart tag is a bit like a dog collar that gives you information about your dog's daily step count, medication breaks, food and toilet times. It's confusingly not a GPS tracker in any way but you can detect where your dog is within a radius of around 384,844 square feet, <a href="https://dottpet.com/tag.html">according to its site</a>.</p>

      <p>Ancestry DNA tests are all the rage right now but what if you could do it for dogs too? The DNA My Dog makes that niche a reality.

      <p>We can't include a doggy DNA kit without also including their mortal enemies, the cats. This kit will give a good idea of what breeds your cat hails from and will confirm your suspicions about your kitty being part tiger, lion or lynx.</p>
      <p>It'll set you back a lot more than a regular human DNA kit but if that's what truly makes your gift recipient happy, what's a few hundred bucks to know their designer kitty really is a rare breed.</p>

      <p>Despite seemingly wanting to the opposite, cats need love and attention too. If your recipient's not able to give them all the playtime they (sometimes secretly) want, they'll need to give them a few toys so they don't wreck the couch or push precious mementos off shelves. This cat laser might be the answer to fill the feline friend's entertainment quota.</p>
      <p>This laser has an automatic switch-off timer to conserve battery power but if their cat can last the full 30 minutes, they'll likely be satisfied for a few hours at least.</p>

      <p>Many pets experience the weekdays at home alone while their owner is off at work and while most owners are responsible, everyone's prone to a haunting 'did I top up the dry food?' moment. Thankfully, technology has introduced smart feeders to the world, which allow you bulk fill a container and ration it out through your smart phone so you can top up even when you're not at home.</p>
      <p>The Petnet SmartFeeder lets you arrange daily meal times and portion sizes and can even be rigged up to order you more pet food when your stocks are running low. It's the perfect gift for forgetful pet owners.</p>
