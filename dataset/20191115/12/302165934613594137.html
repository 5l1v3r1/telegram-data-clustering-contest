      <p>BEIRUT, Nov 15 — Lebanese protesters who have been demanding radical reform reacted with anger today to the reported designation of a new prime minister they regard as emblematic of a failed political system.</p>
      <p>According to senior officials speaking on condition of anonymity and Lebanese press reports, key political players agreed that Mohammed Safadi should be tasked with forming the next government.</p>
      <p>Outgoing Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned on October 29, nearly two weeks into the unprecedented nationwide protests demanding the wholesale removal of a ruling elite seen as corrupt and incompetent.</p>
      <p>President Michel Aoun has said he will support the formation of a government including technocrats but he has not yet announced consultations over a new line-up and there was no official confirmation that Safadi had been designated.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators in his hometown of Tripoli wasted no time in rejecting Safadi, however, and gathered in front of one of his properties to protest against a reported nomination they regard as a provocation.</p>
      <p>“Choosing Mohammed Safadi for prime minister proves that the politicians who rule us are in a deep coma, as if they were on another planet,” said Jamal Badawi, 60.</p>
      <p>Another protester said that as a business tycoon and former minister, Safadi was an embodiment of the kind of political class the protest movement wants to remove.</p>
      <p>“He’s an integral part of this leadership’s fabric,” said Samer Anous, a university professor. “Safadi does not meet the aspirations of the popular uprising in Lebanon.”</p>
      <p>Second city Tripoli has been one of the main hubs of the month-old protest movement, with nightly rallies in its main squares.</p>
      <p>A protest was planned in the afternoon at Zaytuna Bay, a luxury marina in central Beirut which is run by a company Safadi chairs. — AFP</p>
