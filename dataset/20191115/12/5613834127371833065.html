      <p>It’s not <b><i>Halo Infinite</i></b>, but Microsoft’s X019 conference gave <b><i>Halo</i></b> fans something to cheer about. <b><i>Halo: Reach</i></b> will launch for Xbox One and PC via the <b><i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</i></b> on December 3.</p>
      <p>As was reported <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3550725/halo-master-chief-collection-halo-reach-headed-pc/">back in March</a>, rather than release the six games in the collection all at once, Microsoft is opting for a staggered release. <i>Halo: Reach</i> comes to PC as the first installment. Optimized for PC, Halo: Reach will feature mouse and keyboard support, native PC features, up to 4K UHD and at least 60 FPS.</p>
