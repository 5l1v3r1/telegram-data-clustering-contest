      <p><b>North Korea</b> announced today that the <b>US</b> has proposed blocked <b>talks</b> on <b>denuclearization</b> to be <b>resumed</b> in December as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's deadline for <b>US</b> President <b>Donald Trump</b>'s government to propose a mutually acceptable deal to save <b>talks</b> is approaching. BGNES reported.</p>
      <p>In a statement released by state media, North Korean envoy to the <b>talks</b> Kim Myong-gil did not give a clear answer on whether Pyongyang would accept <b>US</b> proposals.</p>
      <p>“If the negotiated solution of issues is possible, we are ready to meet with the U.S. at any place and any time​,” Mr. Kim said. But he added that <b>North Korea</b> had “no willingness to have such negotiations” if the United States merely planned to stall, as ​he said Mr. Biegun’s team had done in Stockholm​, The New York Times reported. The diplomat said Pyongyang did not want to negotiate on minor issues, such as possible <b>US</b> proposals to declare a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean War that ended with a ceasefire rather than a peace treaty or the establishment of bureaus for liaison between the parties.</p>
      <p>Kim Yong Chol said he hoped the comments “reflected the intention” of Trump, calling them “part of positive efforts” on the U.S. side to “preserve” negotiations.</p>
      <p>“However, if this ends up with our naive interpretation and the hostile provocation is committed eventually to incite <b>us</b>, we will be compelled to answer with shocking punishment that would be difficult for the U.S. to cope with,” he said, reported by the Japan Times.</p>
      <p><b>Denuclearization</b> <b>talks</b> have been blocked after the failure of the Kim Jong-un and <b>Donald Trump</b> summit in Vietnam, on which the United States refused to fulfil North Korean demands for a significant lift in sanctions in exchange for Pyongyang's partial renunciation of its nuclear potential, the AP recalls.</p>
      <p>Last month, <b>talks</b> at a working level in Sweden failed because, according to Pyongyang, the "outdated position and approach" of the United States, the agency said.</p>
