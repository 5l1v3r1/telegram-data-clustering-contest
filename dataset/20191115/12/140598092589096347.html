      <h1>What is England's strongest XI? Our football writers pick their teams to start at Euro 2020... and you can select yours too</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:31:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Burt, Paul Hayward, Sam Wallace, Matt Law</a></address>
      <p>England sealed Euro 2020 qualification by hitting seven past Montenegro on Thursday night to celebrate their 1,000th match in emphatic fashion.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions secured top spot in Group A and a return to Wembley for each of their pool games next summer with what was a thumping victory.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane's hat-trick helped Gareth Southgate's men to a 7-0 hammering of hapless Montenegro, with the skipper's treble complementing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Marcus Rashford efforts in a remarkable first half.</p>
      <p>A number of former England greats were in attendance to see the youngest starting XI since 1959 perform so impressively.</p>
      <p>Southgate now has a job on his hands to pick a 23-man squad from so many talented young players, let alone who to squeeze into his preferred starting XI.</p>
      <p>Here, we have asked our England football writers to pick who they think should start in the national team's opening game of Euro 2020...</p>
      <h3>Jason Burt</h3>
      <p>The two key areas to decide upon are the centre of defence and midfield combinations. Joe Gomez and Fiyako Tomori are real threats to John Stones. In midfield, James Maddison and Mason Mount are clear options but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gives a little more power and drive. Harry Winks is far from a certain starter but Gareth Southgate is turning away from a midfield pivot who was a defender, such as Declan Rice or Eric Dier.</p>
      <h3>Paul Hayward</h3>
      <p>Finding the right midfield balance and centre-back pairing are Gareth Southgate's challenges now. The front three and the full-backs pick themselves. I hope Joe Gomez gets the opportunities at Liverpool to show how good he is. John Stones has lost his way but still has time to re-emerge. Fiyako Tomori is developing fast. With Harry Winks and Jordan Henderson deeper, James Maddison would be free to support the three attackers. England have so many good young players pressing claims.</p>
      <h3>Sam Wallace</h3>
      <p>The front three picks itself at the moment – disciplinary matters aside. Ditto the full-backs. Jordan Pickford is the best of a limited goalkeeper selection. It’s in midfield that everything is up for grabs. Given the age profile, Jordan Henderson’s experience feels crucial. On current form James Maddison deserves it, so too Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but there are chances for any one of six or seven others to break in. Joe Gomez and Harry Maguire the best centre-backs among a group who are not getting regular club games. Tyrone Mings, a natural left-footer, must be close.</p>
      <h3>Matt Law</h3>
      <p>England’s defence remains a concern and the players Gareth Southgate has available are naturally more suited to playing three at the back with wing-backs. That may also alleviate the need for a so-called defensive midfielder.</p>
      <p>So there you have it. Three of our writers have gone with 4-4-3 formations, one with a 3-4-3. Do you agree with their selections?</p>
      <p>Have a go at picking your own England XI with our formation-builder below...</p>
