      <p>Lady Elsie Robson, the widow of legendary football manager Sir Bobby Robson, returned to the school sports centre opened by her late husband 13 years ago.</p>
      <p>In 2006, the couple opened the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sir-bobby-robson">Sir Bobby Robson</a> Sports Centre at the Durham Federation in Ushaw Moor, located not far away from where the beloved former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> boss grew up in Langley Park.</p>
      <p>This week, lady Elsie was back at the school to celebrate the difference the facility is making to young people’s lives.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The centre has developed into a community sports hub equipped with modern training facilities and a 3G pitch for the school and local football teams.  </p>
      <p>To ensure the centre continues to thrive for the benefit of future generations, the school has renovated and resurfaced the 3G pitch and invited Lady Elsie along for its official reopening on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>As well as inspecting the resurfaced pitch, Lady Elsie also unveiled a plaque.</p>
      <p>Debbie White, Durham Federation business manager, had just started at the school when the centre opened in 2006.</p>

      <p>Speaking of the fond memories she had of the couple’s visit, she said: “Sir Bobby was a true gentleman and was more than happy to give up his time to talk to the students and have his photograph taken with them.</p>
      <p>“Those of us who were there at the time have such wonderful memories of that visit and we are so honoured that Lady Elsie has come to see us again. It’s been an incredibly special day and a fantastic opportunity for us to show how Sir Bobby’s legacy is continuing to inspire young people.”</p>
      <p>Beyond being a space for youngsters to attend school sports lessons, the centre is also home to Deerness Valley Football Club, Durham United Football Club and Durham County Football Club.</p>
      <p>Head teacher, Alison Jobling, said: “The centre is crucial in helping us to deliver our GCSE curriculum and offer fantastic opportunities to all of our students, especially those who are part of our Evolution Soccer Coaching School. It also means pupils can join a football team and train within the safe and convenient setting of the school. </p>
      <p>“It’s been such a pleasure to show Lady Elsie what we do here and how important the centre is to the community.”</p>
