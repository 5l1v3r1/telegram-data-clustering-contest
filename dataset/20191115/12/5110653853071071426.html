      <p>The 24-year-old forward, who spent three-plus seasons in New York before being traded in January to the Mavericks, was expecting the reaction.</p>
      <p>"It's normal that they feel that way," Porzingis told reporters Wednesday. "All I can do is just look forward to what I have in front of me, not behind."</p>
      <p>After the game, he was asked if he heard the chants from the fans.</p>

      <p>So far, Porzingis has done well away from his first NBA team, averaging 18.3 points and 7.9 rebounds in the 2019-20 season prior to Thursday.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the Knickscan't say the same, even though they completed a season sweep of the Mavs with a 106-103 victory. The win pushed them to 3-9 on the season.</p>
