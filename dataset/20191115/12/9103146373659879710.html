The Government needs to ensure that buyers are identified or have identifiable agents,” he said.<br/> <br/>He also said that if that fails, the government should organize buyer groups or set up cooperatives whereby farmers can safely sell their produce.<br/> <br/>Hudson Agaba, the coordinator of vanilla farmers in Ibanda district, said revealing the identities of buyers will go a long way in curbing theft, which has been rampant in the vanilla growing districts.<br/> <br/>“Having the identities of these people revealed will help us know who we are dealing with. We have many intruders who we do not know even where they come from,” he said.<br/> <br/>They were speaking on the sidelines of a press briefing organized by the Ministry of agriculture to announce the date for the second season harvesting of vanilla in the country.<br/> <br/>In May this year, the government announced June 15 and December 15, 2019, as the harvest dates for the first and second season, respectively. However, due to the delays of rain, the date has been pushed to January 15, 2020.<br/> <br/>Vanilla is the world’s second most expensive spice in the world. Its global consumption ranges from 2,100 to 2,400 metric tons per year over the last 10 years. In 2018, Uganda produced about 300,000Kg of Vanilla and exported 23,000Kg of cured vanilla worth $6.40m.<br/> <br/>This year, Uganda’s export improved from 23 metric tons to 35 metric tons. Uganda exports its vanilla to the USA, France, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Israel, South Africa, Turkey, and Hungary.<br/> <br/>Vanilla is grown in 25 districts of Uganda; mainly in Central, Eastern and Western parts of the country.<br/> <br/>Christopher Kibanzanga, the minister of state for agriculture said the increase in the harvest was because of the guidelines government set on harvesting.<br/> <br/>“We have observed a positive impact on the overall quality of Uganda’s vanilla which was harvested, cured and exported during the June/July harvest season,” he said.<br/> <br/>He said the stringent guideline ensured that vanilla is left to mature. Vanilla becomes fully mature at nine months after pollination.<br/> <br/>Kibanzanga said by this time, the vanillin content is high enough for farmers to harvest and attract good international buyers.<br/> <br/>“This measure was taken to guide farmers on the right time to harvest their vanilla and hence reduce premature harvests, curb theft and ensure that good quality vanilla is exported from Uganda,” he said.<br/> <br/>According to the guideline, harvesting starts on the stipulated date in all vanilla growing districts and takes one week. Whoever, is found selling or harvesting before the stated date, is liable on conviction to six months imprisonment or a fine of sh40,000 or both.<br/> <br/>Agaba praised the guideline on harvesting as the best move that has protected their produce from thieves who harvest their crops prematurely.<br/> <br/>“Having dates for harvesting gazette is a very good move in that all harvests are done on the same day. This in the long run reduces theft and ensures that us farmers gain from our sweat,” he said.</p>
