        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128047">Texans (6-3) at Ravens (7-2)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</b> | <b>CBS</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 90.7 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128047">Spread</a>:</b> BAL -4.5 (51)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Expect a lot of scoring from <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson">Deshaun Watson</a>. This marks the second time in NFL history that two starting quarterbacks under the age of 25 with a passer rating of 100 or better will square off in Week 11 or later. The first occurred a year ago this week, when <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff">Jared Goff</a> and the Rams defeated <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a> and the Chiefs 54-51. <i>-- Jamison Hensley</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> The Ravens break the Texans' steak of not allowing a 100-yard rusher in each of the past two seasons. Jackson and the Ravens have produced six individual 100-yard rushing games this season, tied with the Cowboys and Panthers for most in the NFL. <i>-- Sarah Barshop</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Texans got four sacks against Jacksonville in their first game without defensive end J.J. Watt this season, but they struggled to win consistently in the trenches. According to ESPN's pass rush win rate using NFL Next Gen Stats, the Texans beat their blocks within 2.5 seconds just 28% of the time in Week 9 without Watt, compared to 44% in their first eight games.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> These two quarterbacks share the position lead in games of 25-plus fantasy points this season (five). <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 11 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> Watson is 11-3 against the spread (ATS) in his career as an underdog. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28075162/week-11-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Barshop's pick: </b>Ravens 35, Texans 32<br/><b>Hensley's pick:</b> Ravens 38, Texans 34<br/><b>FPI prediction:</b> BAL, 54.6% (by an average of 1.6 points)</p>

      </h3>
      <p><b>1 p.m. ET</b> | <b>Fox</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 69.0 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128084">Spread</a>:</b> NO -5.5 (50)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Bucs might potentially start two rookie cornerbacks -- <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3873935/jamel-dean">Jamel Dean</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3932886/sean-murphy-bunting">Sean Murphy-Bunting</a> -- on the outside against <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees">Drew Brees</a>, who has lost consecutive division games in a single season just four times since joining the Saints, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research (the last time was in 2016, losing to Carolina and then at Tampa Bay). <i>-- Jenna Laine</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> New Orleans running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054850/alvin-kamara">Alvin Kamara</a> will put a jolt back into his season with 150 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns. The Saints' offense obviously needs a spark, and Kamara is now far enough removed from his ankle and knee injuries that coach Sean Payton should be able to unleash him a little more. <i>-- Mike Triplett</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Saints receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976316/michael-thomas">Michael Thomas</a> has at least 10 receptions and 100 yards in back-to-back games. Only four players in NFL history have done it three or more times in a row. In the Week 5 meeting between these two teams, Thomas had 11 catches for 182 yards and a pair of touchdowns.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Tampa Bay's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16737/mike-evans">Mike Evans</a> led all players (not just receivers) in fantasy points scored via the deep pass last season and is on pace to do it again this season. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 11 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> New Orleans is 9-3 ATS on the road over the past two seasons, the best mark in the NFL. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28075162/week-11-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051392/ezekiel-elliott">Ezekiel Elliott</a> had 152 yards rushing and 88 yards receiving when these teams played last season. The Lions' run defense might be worse than a season ago -- and Elliott might be better. If the Dallas running back is able to get going early, he could be in line for another monster day, considering Detroit's struggles against top-flight backs all year long. <i>-- Michael Rothstein</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> The Cowboys will score a touchdown on their first possession. They have scored only once on the first drive in a game this season and did so with a short field after a defensive takeaway against Philadelphia. Making this even bolder: The Lions have allowed just one touchdown on opponents' first possession. <i>-- Todd Archer</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Dallas leads the NFL in third-down conversion rate (51.4%). And the Lions are allowing teams to convert on 44.8% of third downs, tied for 26th in the NFL.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Through 10 weeks, only <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a> have a higher average weekly fantasy ranking than Cowboys quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott">Dak Prescott</a>. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 11 rankings</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Vikings running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116593/dalvin-cook">Dalvin Cook</a> has notched 100 yards of offense in eight of his 10 games this season. The role he has taken on in the passing game has allowed Minnesota to dismantle teams with its explosive screen and play-action attack. Even if the Broncos sell out to stop Cook on the ground, they'll have to account for him, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976212/stefon-diggs">Stefon Diggs</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14054/kyle-rudolph">Kyle Rudolph</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040980/irv-smith-jr">Irv Smith Jr</a>. through the air. <i>-- Courtney Cronin</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> The Broncos will get a rushing touchdown. While <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128429/courtland-sutton">Courtland Sutton</a> figures to have a big day for the Broncos, the Vikings have surrendered just two rushing touchdowns all season, and both have come in two of their losses -- to the Packers and to the Chiefs. <i>-- Jeff Legwold</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Minnesota quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins">Kirk Cousins</a> had the fourth-worst Total QBR (28.0) among qualified QBs and a 64.6% completion mark through four weeks. But since Week 5, he is completing 71.5% of his passes (third best in the NFL) and has 15 passing touchdowns to just one interception. And his 73.7 QBR ranks fourth in the NFL during that span.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Sutton has accounted for 34.3% of his team's receiving yards, the NFL's second-highest rate behind <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976316/michael-thomas">Michael Thomas</a>. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 11 rankings</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Keep an eye on the battle between the Colts' offensive line and the Jaguars' defensive line. Quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578570/jacoby-brissett">Jacoby Brissett</a>, expected to start after missing the Week 10 game with a sprained left MCL, was sacked 14 times, including 10 in one game, in two starts against the Jaguars in 2017. Brissett said their offensive line is different from two years ago; that's a good thing because the Jaguars are sixth in the NFL in sacks with 30. <i>-- Mike Wells</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Jaguars tailback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115364/leonard-fournette">Leonard Fournette</a> will score two red zone touchdowns. The Jaguars have struggled scoring touchdowns in the red zone (34.5%, 30th in the NFL), but the return of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14877/nick-foles">Nick Foles</a> under center will help. His experience will lead to quicker decisions and should open things up for Fournette, who has just one rushing touchdown this season. <i>-- Mike DiRocco</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Foles is 10-2 as a starter in November or later (including playoffs) over the past four seasons. That's the best winning percentage (.833) by a starting QB with at least 12 starts in that time, besting <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a>'s 27-7 record.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> The Colts' <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16504/jack-doyle">Jack Doyle</a> (46% available) is one of four tight ends with at least 10 fantasy points in each of his past three games. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 11 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> Over the past four seasons, Jacksonville is 7-0-1 ATS against Indianapolis. And Indianapolis has been shut out in two of the past four meetings. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28075162/week-11-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Jones goes for 200 yards and three touchdowns.

      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Ryan has a career-low 58.6 Total QBR through eight starts but still ranks 11th among 33 qualifying QBs. Perhaps not helping the matter, the Falcons have the fourth-worst pass block win rate using NFL Next Gen Stats (47%) in the NFL.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> McCaffrey has more fantasy points as a pass-catcher this season than <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a>. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 11 rankings</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Redskins will want to run vs. the Jets' run defense. In the Redskins' past four games, running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10452/adrian-peterson">Adrian Peterson</a> averaged 5.1 yards per carry and 18.8 carries per game. But in the Jets' past four games, their run defense has allowed just 2.4 yards per carry on 109 attempts. <i>-- John Keim</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Rookie Washington quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040616/dwayne-haskins">Dwayne Haskins</a> will throw his first touchdown pass and rookie receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121422/terry-mclaurin">Terry McLaurin</a> will top the 100-yard mark for the second time in three games. Haskins is struggling, but he will face an inviting group of cornerbacks -- perhaps the weakest group of corners he'll see in his NFL career. Due to injuries, the Jets are down to backups and unheralded rookies. <i>-- Rich Cimini</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Redskins have gone 13 straight quarters without scoring a touchdown, the longest streak in the NFL this season and tied for the third-longest single-season streak by any team since 2001.</p>

      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> This Bills' offense finally comes to life, as Allen completes his first pass that travels 30-plus yards and Singletary racks up more than 100 total yards. <i>-- Marcel Louis-Jacques</i></p>

With DeSean Jackson already out for the rest of the regular season, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573079/carson-wentz">Carson Wentz</a> will have limited weapons at his disposal against a Patriots defense that ranks first in interceptions (19) and passing touchdowns allowed (3). <i>-- Tim McManus</i></p>

        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128092">Bengals (0-9) at Raiders (5-4)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>4:25 p.m. ET</b> | <b>CBS</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 35.6 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128092">Spread</a>:</b> OAK -11 (48.5)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Raiders will use their running game against the worst run defense in the league (the Bengals are giving up 173.0 yards per game) to set up play-action passing to tight end <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576925/darren-waller">Darren Waller</a>. If they handle their business against the winless Bengals and at the 2-7 Jets next week, the Raiders will roll into Kansas City on Dec. 1 with first place in the AFC West on the line. <i>-- Paul Gutierrez</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Waller will have two touchdowns. The Bengals have struggled to contain opposing tight ends, and Waller should be a matchup problem all afternoon. <i>-- Ben Baby</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Oakland running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047365/josh-jacobs">Josh Jacobs</a>' 811 rushing yards this season are already a team rookie record. And he has three games with at least 100 yards rushing, tied with Hall of Famer Marcus Allen for the most by a Raiders rookie in franchise history.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Cincinnati running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116385/joe-mixon">Joe Mixon</a> ranks 14th in the NFL with 131 carries entering Week 11, but he is not one of the 82 players with a 20-plus-yard rush or one of the 94 players with a rushing touchdown. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 11 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> This is the second time in the past 15 seasons Oakland has been a double-digit favorite. The other came in 2017 when it was a 14-point favorite over the Jets, which it won by 25 points. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28075162/week-11-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Baby's pick: </b>Raiders 30, Bengals 13<br/><b>Gutierrez's pick:</b> Raiders 31, Bengals 16<br/><b>FPI prediction:</b> OAK, 84.4% (by an average of 13.5 points)</p>

        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128133">Bears (4-5) at Rams (5-4)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>8:20 p.m. ET</b> | <b>NBC</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 60.8 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128133">Spread</a>:</b> LAR -6.5 (40)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Rams' offense this season has been a shell of its former self. Quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff">Jared Goff</a> has a Total QBR of 29.7 -- fifth worst in the NFL -- and there's no relief in sight. The offensive line has been decimated by injuries, and three first-year starters must be prepared to line up across from a formidable Bears front, including outside linebacker <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16710/khalil-mack">Khalil Mack</a>. <i>-- Lindsey Thiry</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Look for Mack to bust out and flood the stat sheet against the Rams, despite just one sack in his past five games. In six prime-time games with the Bears, Mack has recorded six sacks, seven forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception return for a touchdown. And last season, Mack had a sack and forced fumble in Chicago's victory over Los Angeles. <i>-- Jeff Dickerson</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Chicago quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3039707/mitchell-trubisky">Mitchell Trubisky</a>'s 35.8 Total QBR this season is the second worst in the NFL ahead of only Tennessee backup <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576980/marcus-mariota">Marcus Mariota</a>. And Trubisky's 5.8 yards per attempt this season is the worst mark in the NFL.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977644/todd-gurley-ii">Todd Gurley II</a> averaged 22.5 touches per game last season for the Rams. Yet he has a <i>total</i> of 22 touches over his past two games. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 11 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> All six prime-time games in the previous two weeks went over the total after prime-time games went 19-5 to the under in Weeks 1-8. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28075162/week-11-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128134">Chargers (4-6) vs. Chiefs (6-4)</a>, Mexico City</h3>
      <p><b>Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET</b> | <b>ESPN/<a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/">ESPN App</a></b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 78.7 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128134">Spread</a>:</b> KC -4 (52.5)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Chiefs receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill">Tyreek Hill</a> has had some big games against the Chargers, and he's on a roll of late with 17 catches for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the past two games. The Chargers are fifth in the league in passing yards allowed, so something has to give. <i>-- Adam Teicher</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> The Chargers will rush for 200 yards. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576434/melvin-gordon">Melvin Gordon</a> recorded his first 100-yard rushing game of the season last week (108) in a loss to the Raiders. The Chiefs are giving up 148 rushing yards per game, second worst in the NFL. The combination of Gordon and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3068267/austin-ekeler">Austin Ekeler</a> should create problems for Kansas City defensively. <i>-- Eric D. Williams</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> According to ESPN pass coverage metrics powered by NFL Next Gen Stats, the Chargers play zone coverage at the third-highest rate in the NFL. And Kansas City's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a> leads the league in yards per dropback (10.9) against zone, while also completing 80% of his passes and posting a 96 QBR.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Chargers quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5529/philip-rivers">Philip Rivers</a> averaged 9.1 fantasy points per game against Kansas City from 2015 to 2017, but he righted the ship last season and averaged 23.7 against the divisional rival. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 11 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> Rivers is 15-5-1 ATS (12-9 straight up) in prime-time games as an underdog. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28075162/week-11-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>
