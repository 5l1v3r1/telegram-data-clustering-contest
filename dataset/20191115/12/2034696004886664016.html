      <p>Prinze Jr plays Sandy the nanny in the show, but he now reveals that he only picked up the part because a certain star couldn’t fulfil the role.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t even supposed to be [Sandy], that was originally offered to Tom Hanks,” he told <i><a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/14/freddie-prinze-jr-says-tom-hanks-was-supposed-to-play-sandy-on-friends/">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>. “But he wasn’t gonna make it back from his film on time.</p>
      <p>“So my agent called me and said, ‘Do you want to be on F<i>riends</i>?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, I’ll do an episode of <i>Friends</i>. That’ll be great.’ He said, ‘Yeah, it shoots tomorrow.'”</p>

      <p>In the set, Sandy plays baby Emma a rendition of ‘Greensleeves’ on the recorder during the episode, which he reveals he had to learn in a mere few hours.</p>
