        <b>Manchester City have failed in an initial bid to have the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) halt Uefa's investigation into a possible breach of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.</b>
      </p>
      <p>City have been referred to Uefa's financial watchdog, the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) and if found guilty could face a Champions League ban.</p>
      <p>Cas said City's appeal was "inadmissible" at this stage because the CFCB has not yet determined what, if any, punishment would be applied if they were found guilty.</p>
      <p>The club, who deny wrongdoing, had argued that Uefa did not have the authority to bring an FFP case against them.</p>
      <p>Uefa <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48265079">launched an investigation</a> after German newspaper Der Spiegel published leaked documents alleging City had inflated the value of a multimillion-pound sponsorship deal, misleading European football's governing body.</p>
      <p>Reports alleged City deliberately misled Uefa so they could meet FFP rules requiring clubs to break even.</p>
      <p>The Premier League champions, FA Cup and League Cup winners were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27445475">fined Â£49m in 2014</a> for a previous breach of regulations.</p>
