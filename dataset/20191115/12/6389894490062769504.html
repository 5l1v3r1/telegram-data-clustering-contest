      <h1>Manchester City lose financial fair play appeal to prevent Uefa investigating allegations</h1>

      <p>Manchester City’s efforts to block a Uefa investigation into financial fair play violations have been rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</p>
      <p>City had asked CAS to throw out the case brought against the club by Uefa for allegedly breaching financial fair play rules.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But CAS has rejected City’s appeal and now the case is set to be heard by the adjudicatory chamber of Uefa’s Club Financial Control Board.</p>
      <p>“CAS ruled that the appeal filed by Manchester City football club is inadmissible,” CAS general secretary Matthieu Reeb said.</p>
      <p>Reigning back-to-back Premier League champions City lodged the appeal with CAS in June on the basis that there were not legitimate grounds for an investigation to take place.</p>
      <p>But a three-man panel ruled in Uefa’s favour.</p>
      <p>It means the governing body can now begin their probe into allegations that City breached FFP rules, which if found guilty, could result in expulsion from the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Under the FFP rules, clubs are not allowed to spend more than the revenue they generate up to a specific amount.</p>
      <p>But City are alleged to have used sponsorship money from their owners as a way around the rules, according to a report in Der Speigel.</p>
      <p>It comes less than two weeks after English Premiership Rugby champions <a href="https://www.cityam.com/saracens-could-challenge-legality-of-premiership-salary-cap/">Saracens were handed a 35-point deduction and £5.4m fine</a> for breaching salary cap regulations.</p>

      <p>City have previously denied all allegations against them.</p>
      <p>The verdict from Uefa’s investigation is expected to be announced next month, although the Athletic report that City will not be banned from the Champions League.</p>
