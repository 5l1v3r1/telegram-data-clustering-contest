      <h1>Mayank Agarwal betters Don Bradman</h1>

      <p><b>12</b> - Number of innings taken by <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/398438.html">Mayank Agarwal</a> to score two double-centuries in his Test career. Only one batsman has played fewer innings to achieve the same. Vinod Kambli made his second double-hundred in just his <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/30009.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings">fifth innings</a>, in 1993. Sir Don Bradman made his second double century in his 13th innings. Mayank scored his maiden double-century against South Africa in Visakhapatnam last month.</p>

      <p><b>8</b> - Sixes hit by Agarwal, the <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;orderby=sixes;team=6;template=results;type=batting;view=innings">joint-most</a> by an India batsman in a Test innings. He equalled Navjot Sidhu's eight sixes against Sri Lanka in <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63631.html">Lucknow</a> in 1994. All of Agarwal's eight sixes were off the spinners. Six of them came after he stepped out of the crease. He stepped out nine times in the innings, collecting six sixes and two fours from those deliveries.</p>
      <p><b>96</b> - Mayank's control percentage in this innings. He was in control of 317 of the 330 balls he faced. It is the highest control percentage in a 200-plus Test innings in the last 10 years among batsmen batting in the top five. The other three India batsmen who scored fifty-plus - Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, and Ravindra Jadeja - also had control percentages of at least 94.</p>

      <aside>Highest control% in an innings of 200+ runs in Tests in last 10 years (top-5 batsmen)</aside>
      <p><b>407</b> - Runs scored by India on the second day of this Test, in 88 overs. Overall, the batsmen had a control percentage of 94.54 in the day. Out of 531 balls, they were not in control of only 29. The most runs India have accumulated in a day's play is 443, on Day 2 of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/13435/scorecard/430883/india-vs-sri-lanka-3rd-test-sri-lanka-tour-of-india-2009-10">Brabourne Test</a> against Sri Lanka in 2009.</p>
      <p><b>4</b> - Successive Tests in which India have had at least <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;groupby=match;orderby=start;page=3;size=200;team=6;template=results;type=batting">one batsman scoring a double-century</a>. In the three Tests of the South Africa series, Agarwal, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma made a double each, and now Agarwal has continued the trend into the fourth Test of the home season. It is the first such instance for India. In 2016-17, India had three consecutive Tests with a double-centurion: Kohli and Karun Nair in the last two Tests against England, and Kohli against Bangladesh.</p>
