        <b>With Salman Khan shooting for Weekend Ka Vaar episode, Anil Kapoor is reported to be on the sets of Bigg Boss 13 for the promotion of his upcoming movie Pagalpanti. According to the latest update, the actor has made his grand entry on one of his iconic dance numbers, My name is Lakhan, entertaining the audience</b>

      <p>Bigg Boss 13 host Salman Khan is currently shooting for the Weekend Ka Vaar episode in FilmCity, Mumbai, hence we can expect a lot of updates on the social media platforms, reporting about the live happenings from inside the house.  With <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-bb-housemates-cleverly-send-mahira-sharma-and-paras-chhabra-inside-bb-jail-watch-video/5dce867487fb571eff7e3eae">Mahira Sharma and Paras Chhabra being sent to the jail</a> for various reasons in the latest episode, we too can expect Salman schooling them, as well as giving a piece of mind to the housemates for their irrational behaviour on the show like he always does.<br/><br/>But on a happier and brighter side, we shall be witnessing the ever young actor Anil Kapoor shaking a leg on the stage of Bigg Boss 13. According to the latest update on The Khabri's twitter handle, Anil is reported to be grooving on the iconic dance number, My Name is Lakhan from the movie Ram Lakhan that released in 1989. We can totally imagine the enthusiasm on the sets with Anil’s presence on the show along with Salman Khan. The talented actor is on the promotional spree of his upcoming movie <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/pagalpanti">Pagalpanti</a>.

      <p>Anil Kapoor is accompanied by his co-star John Abraham; the movie also stars Pulkit Samrat, but we doubt if the actor shows up on the show, keeping in mind his equation with Khan going for a toss. Pulkit Samrat’s ex-wife Shweta Rohira, shares a brotherly bond with Khan, probably putting the actor in Khan’s bad books.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:www.misskyra.com</i></p>
