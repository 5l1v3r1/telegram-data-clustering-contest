      <h1>Deep-fried fury: EU launches frites lawsuit against Colombia</h1>
      <h2>EU trade officials fear chain reaction on farm produce.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:15:21+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jakob Hanke</a></address>
      <p>The European Union Friday launched a World Trade Organization dispute against Colombia over tariffs on European fries, according to a Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_6221">announcement</a>.</p>
      <p>Colombia last year imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 3 percent to 8 percent on frozen fries from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, arguing the EU is exporting its potato chips below the real cost of production.</p>
      <p>While this case focuses on potato chips solely, it represents a much wider risk to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
      <p>Colombia argues that the CAP's farm subsidies lead to overproduction, which EU farmers dump on foreign markets.</p>
      <p>In a similar case last year, the U.S. imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs on Spanish olives, arguing that CAP payments allow EU producers to export below cost.</p>
      <p>EU trade officials are increasingly nervous that those attacks on its farm subsidy system could encourage more countries to impose anti-dumping tariffs, leading to a chain reaction.</p>
      <p>One EU official warned that the U.S. reasoning on olives could also be applied to other EU food exports, saying a new anti-dumping investigation would require "a simple copy-paste."</p>
      <p>Former EU trade chief Jean-Luc Demarty warned last year that the EU <a href="https://www.politico.eu/pro/eu-trade-chief-warns-brussels-must-be-vigilant-over-farm-subsidies/">stood to lose if its CAP subsidies were challenged</a> at the WTO.</p>
      <p>"I think we would not like the WTO looking at ... our subsidies and to rule if our green box are really green," he said.</p>
      <p>Demarty warned that sectoral farm subsidies were particularly risky. "I would like to alert that this type of support ... could be easy targets for anti-subsidy [tariffs]."</p>
