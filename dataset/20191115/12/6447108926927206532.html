      <h1>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order review round-up</h1>

      <p>It’s been a long time since we’ve got to be a Jedi in a new video game, and so I’m sure a lot of Star Wars fans will have had their fingers crossed for Respawn Entertainment’s Jedi: Fallen Order. Please, oh please, could we have a good Star Wars game without any launch day nonsense and troublesome loot boxes?</p>
      <p>Well, it seems as though Respawn have delivered. <b><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Our own review hands it an 8/10</a>,</b> Jim saying that “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is exactly the kind of single player game we had originally hoped to see when EA and Disney joined forces. Even if you strip away the license, you’re left with a super satisfying mix or combat, story, and exploration, deftly crafted by a studio best known for spearheading an entirely different genre.”</p>
      <p>But what about the rest of the games industry? Let’s check in on opinions from critics from across the galaxy:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-solid-combat-mired-in-shallow-storytelling-and-technical-problems"><b>Eurogamer</b></a> – no recommendation</p>
      <p>Fallen Order has an incredible gameplay experience at its core, with fantastic environments and well-directed action sequences. Yet it’s unable to sustain this thanks to some fundamental design problems.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-turbulent-thrill-ride"><b>Game Informer</b></a> – 8.75/10</p>
      <p>Respawn Entertainment’s maiden voyage with Star Wars is largely a success, but it’s a little rough around the edges.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review/"><b>Games Radar</b> </a>– 4/5</p>
      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order might take ideas liberally from others, but the result is an endearing adventure that ranks as EA’s best Star Wars effort yet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-the-friends-we-/1900-6417364/"><b>Gamespot</b></a> – 8/10</p>
      <p>Fallen Order borrows liberally from other action games, but those elements work together with Respawn’s combat and environment design, and a story that finds humanity in the Force and in its characters, to hone in on what makes the world of Star Wars worthy of revisiting again and again. Even with some rough edges, Fallen Order represents one of the most compelling game additions to the Star Wars franchise in years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review/"><b>God is a Geek</b></a> – 8/10</p>
      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has some remarkable combat, with a decent story that feels more like Rogue One than one of the main Episodes. The ending was a bit of a let down, but the challenges you’ll face (particularly on a higher difficulty) and the amount of exploration to be done make it a game you should certainly play if you’re a fan of Star Wars, the genre, or both.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review?"><b>The Guardian</b></a> – ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
      <p>In relaunching a much-loved and much-missed Star Wars genre, Fallen Order does exactly what it set out to. It reaches the bar, but then stops, with a set of characters and adventures that are not particularly intriguing or fresh, but certainly feel like they come from that very particularly galaxy, far, far away.</p>
      <p><a href="https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review"><b>IGN</b></a> – 9/10</p>
      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time with a fantastic single-player action-adventure that marks the return of the playable Jedi.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/15/20965341/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">Polygon</a></b> – unscored</p>
      <p>Jedi: Fallen Order is a flawed, sometimes messy game, but it’s a Star Wars experience I didn’t know I wanted. And after finishing it, I definitely want more.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/114986/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-between-light-and-dark"><b>ShackNews</b></a> – 7/10</p>
      <p>While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has some exciting combat and moments of genuinely interesting storytelling and acting, it just falls short of hitting the mark. It borrows heavily from several genres without actually adding anything new to the conversation. That’s not to say it’s bad, it just didn’t leave me wanting to revisit this galaxy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review"><b>US Gamer</b></a> – 3.5/5</p>
      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order comes painfully close to being the best action game of the year, but it ultimately falls short due to pacing problems and a host of technical issues. Still, this is the first step into a larger world for a franchise that has persistently struggled since its acquisition by EA.</p>
