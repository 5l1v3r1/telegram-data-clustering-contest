      <p>The <b>EU</b> is launching a <b>lawsuit</b> against London for failing to nominate a <b>commissioner</b>, despite Brexit's delay holding Britain in the Union, BTA reported.</p>
      <p>The European Commission, the <b>EU</b>'s executive power, "has today sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching its <b>EU</b> treaty obligations by not suggesting a candidate for the post of <b>EU</b> <b>Commissioner</b>," a statement said.</p>
      <p>This move, known as an infringement procedure, is the start of a lengthy process involving several warnings, but it can ultimately lead to a judgment against the <b>UK</b>'s highest court on enforcement.</p>
      <p>Ursula von der Layen has twice written to Prime Minister <b>Boris Johnson</b>, urging him to appoint a commissioner.</p>
      <p>"We have written to the <b>EU</b> to confirm that pre-election guidance states the <b>UK</b> should not normally make nominations for international appointments during this period," a <b>UK</b> official said.</p>
      <p>The former German defense minister hoped to head a 28-member team of senior officials from each of the <b>EU</b> member states in time for her commission to take office on December 1st. But London notified the <b>EU</b> on Wednesday, after a long delay, that it would not appoint a British member of its senior team before the December 12th parliamentary elections. </p>
