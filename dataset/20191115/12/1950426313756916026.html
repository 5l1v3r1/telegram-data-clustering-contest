      <h1>‘NoFap’ founder files defamation suit against sex scientist who denies ‘porn addiction’ exists</h1>
      <h2>The suit was brought by NoFap figurehead Alexander Rhodes, who alleges neuroscientist Nicole Prause has slandered him with dubious claims</h2>

        <b>The founder of anti-masturbation movement NoFap has sued a sex specialist for defamation, arguing the scientist – who has questioned the concept of “porn addiction” in her work – falsely accused him of harassment.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6548438-Alexander-Rhodes-Complaint.html">suit</a> was brought by NoFap figurehead Alexander Rhodes, who alleges neuroscientist Nicole Prause has slandered him with dubious claims ranging from cyberstalking to supporting <i>“hate groups.”</i> Rhodes says this has caused him <i>“significant reputational harm”</i> and financial damages exceeding $75,000.</p>
      <p>Andrew Stebbins, Rhodes’ attorney, told Motherboard his client would not accept <i>“malicious personal attacks from those who seek to discredit, disparage and otherwise injure him through false statements designed to assassinate his character and reputation,”</i> adding the case was <i>“brought solely in response … to such attacks.”</i></p>

      <p>For her part, Prause insists she has been the victim of harassment from not only Rhodes himself but from rank-and-file NoFappers, including death threats, which she claims to have forwarded to the FBI. Responding to the lawsuit, the scientist says she, not Rhodes, is the victim of defamation.</p>
      <p><i>“Alexander Rhodes and NoFap’s lawsuit has no merit nor do his libelous and unfounded assertions regarding me, my character, or my business,”</i> Prause told Motherboard. <i>“He is entitled to his opinions, however he is not entitled to spread complete falsehoods about me to profit himself and silence speech.”</i></p>

      <p>In his complaint, brought in late October, Rhodes explains that a lifelong porn addiction led him to launch NoFap in 2011, initially as a <i>“forum for people to discuss the effects of excessive internet pornography viewing”</i> and <i>“compulsive sexual behavior.”</i> Though it started out as a page on Reddit – which now amassed some 515,000 subscribers – Rhodes would create a standalone website for the idea as it gained traction online.</p>
      <p>A study co-authored by Prause in 2013 questioned the scientific basis for the notions of sex and porn <i>“addiction”</i> – which are central to the NoFap concept – arguing hypersexuality might be better understood as a <i>“non-pathological variation of high sexual desire,”</i> as opposed to a standard addiction.</p>
