      <p>UEFA’s investigation into alleged breaches of financial fair play by Manchester City will continue after the club’s attempt to have it thrown out was ruled inadmissible.</p>
      <p>City challenged the legitimacy of UEFA’s probe but the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled against the club because the legal process is not yet at an end.</p>
      <p>The adjudicatory chamber of UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body can now hold a hearing into the matter, with City facing a possible ban from European competition.</p>

      <p>When it was deemed City did have a case to answer, the club reacted strongly, saying: “The decision contains mistakes, misinterpretations and confusions fundamentally borne out of a basic lack of due process.”</p>
      <p>The CAS statement read: “In the present case, the decision rendered by the CFCB IC (investigatory chamber) to refer a case to the CFCB AC is not final and can therefore not be appealed to CAS directly.”</p>

      <p>City accepted the sanction, which included a restriction on the size of their Champions League squad, but were eventually reimbursed with two thirds of their fine in 2017 for apparently complying with the rules.</p>
      <p>However, the CFCB’s investigatory arm concluded that City lied to them during that investigation and passed the matter to the adjudicatory chamber for a decision on punishment.</p>
      <p>A brief statement from UEFA read: “We acknowledge the decision taken today by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. We have no further comment to make.”</p>
