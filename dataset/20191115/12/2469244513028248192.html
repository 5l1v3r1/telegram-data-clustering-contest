      <p>The Met Office has had its say on the chances of more snow falling across the south west following heavy showers.</p>
      <p>Dartmoor, Exmoor and Okehampton were all hit by heavy snow earlier this week, with at least two inches falling in some places.</p>
      <p>It led to disruption on major roads across the region, with several accidents reported.</p>
      <p>Stunning pictures taken on Thursday morning show snow settled on Dartmoor with further wintry showers expected falling later on.</p>
      <p>However, most of the snow has since melted, with the Met Office playing down any further snow for the next few days.</p>

      <p>Press officer Oli Claydon told Devon Live: "It doesn't look like there will be anymore snow for the south west for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>"Any snow on Dartmoor looks to be disappearing throughout Friday, leaving much drier conditions.</p>
      <p>"It is looking much drier generally for the weekend, but there are a band of persistent rain showers moving in from Ireland to the tip of Cornwall.</p>
      <p>"Dartmoor and Devon overall is looking dry, if not slightly drizzly.</p>

      <p>"It will be Brighter Saturday afternoon and into Sunday and Monday.</p>
      <p>"But Tuesday afternoon is looking wet."</p>
      <p>Temperatures have plummeted across the country this week, with overnight frosts, but it will be getting slightly milder.</p>
      <p>Oli added: "We are looking at highs of 9C on Saturday, potentially 10C in Camborne.</p>
      <p>"Overnight tonight we are looking at 6C in Plymouth Plymouth but it could be lower in some parts."</p>

      <p>So it's bad news for those hoping to see some wintry showers this weekend.</p>
      <p>"Unless you're on the high moors of Scotland," Oli added.</p>
