      <p>Jurgen Klopp and his established regulars will be in Qatar competing in the FIFA Club World Cup, with Liverpool already confirming two separate squads will be used.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have taken the bigger allocation, meaning, as Wolves did, they will be in the North Stand, with season ticket holders needing to relocate.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The visitors are using the game as a chance for fans who do not normally get the chance to see Klopp's men play on the road.</p>
      <p>But Villa have confirmed that any home fans purchasing tickets for Liverpool fans will have their right to purchase further seats removed.</p>
      <p>Tickets will go on sale to season ticket holders from 17.00 on November 15, with a tiered release from then onwards.</p>
