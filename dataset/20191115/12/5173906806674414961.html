        <b>Portugal’s Supreme Court of Justice has rejected a request for the immediate release ('habeas corpus') of the woman who was in pre-trial detention for abandoning her newborn child in a rubbish bin in Lisbon last week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The information was provided to Lusa by a judicial source.</p>
      <p>A group of lawyers presented this week at the court a request for the immediate release of the young woman, for considering preventive detention illegal.</p>
      <p>The mother, a 22-year-old homeless girl who abandoned her newborn in a rubbish bin in Lisbon, was arrested by the Polícia Judiciária (PJ) police force and is in pre-trial detention, charged with attempted murder.</p>
      <p>According to PJ, the newborn's mother acted alone and never revealed the pregnancy to anyone, living in a very precarious situation on the public road.</p>
