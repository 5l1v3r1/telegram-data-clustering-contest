      <h1>The Spanish media really aren't happy with Gareth Bale playing for Wales this week and he finds it all 'hilarious'</h1>
      <h2>Wales' talisman laughed off criticism from the Spanish press ahead of Wales' clash with Azerbaijan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:20:51+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Mitchelmore</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Bale admits he finds the Spanish media's reports of an apparent club v country row involving him "hilarious" ahead of Wales' crunch Euro 2020 qualifier with Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has not played a single minute of action since the 1-1 draw with Croatia in Cardiff last month.</p>
      <p>Despite his lack of game time for Real Madrid, Bale was called up for international duty this week and is set to feature against Azerbaijan in Baku.</p>
      <p>The Welshman's availability for Wales following his absence for his club riled many of those in the Spanish capital.</p>
      <p>Ex-Madridista Pedja Mijatovic recently stuck the boot into Bale, criticising the Cardiff-born star's love of golf.</p>
      <p>In a column for Spanish media outlet AS, he wrote: "The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid."</p>
      <p>It prompted one member of the Red Wall to add the slogan "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order" to a Welsh flag.</p>

      <p>One newspaper also carried the headline "Triple Bogey" on the front page along with a picture of Bale playing golf.</p>
      <p>But Bale simply laughed off the criticism of the Spanish press ahead of Wales' clash with Azerbaijan at the Bakcell Arena.</p>
      <p>“They have their own opinion of me. It’s just one of those things. Whether it’s good or bad, it’s about me so I must sell papers," he said.</p>
      <p>“I’ve heard some stories but I don’t really take notice. My friends tend to send me some funny pictures or whatever they write. I’ve tried to get back as quick as I can.</p>
      <p>“I find it hilarious to be honest, especially some of the pictures and stuff my friends send me. On one it said triple bogey and I’ve never had a triple bogey! At least give me an albatross! It’s funny.</p>

      <p>"Some of the things I have seen, people don’t understand and don’t know what they’re on about, so I just find it quite funny.</p>
      <p>"If there had been a Real Madrid game this week, I would’ve been fit and training to play.</p>
      <p>"Maybe to them it doesn’t look great but it’s just a kind of coincidence that the national team comes around this week and I’ve returned to full training.</p>
      <p>"If I’m fit, no matter where I am, I’m going to try and play, whether it be for Wales or Madrid.</p>
      <p>"For me, it was a no-brainer: if I’m fit to play, then I’ll give it my all."</p>

      <p>Bale was left limping on the pitch in the latter stages of the draw with Croatia in October.</p>
      <p>And he has featured just seven times in all competitions for Real Madrid to far this term, scoring twice.</p>
      <p>But Bale admits he's done everything in his power to be fit and firing for Wales in their crucial double header with Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>
      <p>“We understand how big the games are," he added.</p>
      <p>"My fitness, I’ve done my rehab, done four weeks training.</p>
      <p>"Obviously there are two big games and I’m not sure if I’ll play the two whole 90 minutes but I’ll do my best to play as much as I can.”</p>
      <p>“I fully understand the position I’m in. I’ve done as much as I can in terms of trying to get back as quick as I can.</p>
      <p>"I’ve done four weeks’ training and we’ve done 11 v 11 to try and get some match fitness in me. I’m as prepared as I can be. The only thing I can do is give my best, which I always do.”</p>
