      <p>New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday called the odd-even rationing scheme ‘half-baked’ and said that it might not be a solution to control the deteriorating air quality in the national capital.</p>
      <p>The apex court said that despite the implementation of the scheme, the pollution levels have continued to increase.</p>
      <p>Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Delhi government, told the court that if certain exemptions are removed, it will help.</p>
      <p>"We are trying to work it out further. If two-wheelers are not allowed, the city will come to a standstill," he said. He further said that stubble burning is the main cause of air pollution.</p>
      <p>The court pulled up Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government and asked it to apprise it about the effect of the scheme on air pollution levels.</p>

      <p>"Even Delhi government's affidavit says we have not conducted such study on the odd-even. It's a halfway solution, either it's full odd-even or no odd-even, there has to be no exemption. We don't know whether it's really working or not," the top court said.</p>
      <p>It added, "Delhi is suffering badly, the AQI is almost 600 even today. How do people breathe?"</p>
      <p>The court also directed the Centre to prepare a road map for installation of air-purifying towers to deal with the pollution crisis in the national capital.</p>
      <p>The air pollution levels in Delhi and its adjoining areas remained in the 'severe' category today for the third consecutive day.</p>
      <p>The overall <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-air-quality-index">Air Quality Index </a>(AQI) in the national capital was recorded at 482 which falls under the 'Severe' category with PM10 being 504 and PM2.5 - 332, according to Center-run SAFAR.</p>
