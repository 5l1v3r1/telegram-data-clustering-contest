      <p>English football great Alan Shearer and Scotland Women’s national team manager Shelley Kerr are to be awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Stirling.</p>
      <p>The pair will receive their awards at the university’s graduation ceremony next week.</p>
      <p>Shearer is the English Premier League’s all-time record goalscorer, while Kerr this year led Scotland’s women to their first World Cup, having previously won every domestic honour in Scotland as a defender.</p>

      <p>Professor Gerry McCormac, principal and vice-chancellor of the university, said: “I am delighted that we will honour two outstanding individuals from the world of football at our winter graduation ceremonies.</p>
      <p>“Shelley Kerr is a good friend of this university, having studied here and managed our men’s first team between 2014 and 2017 – an appointment that saw her celebrated as the first woman to manage a senior men’s team in Britain.</p>
      <p>“Alan Shearer is a man who needs no introduction – a football great who competed at the highest level for almost two decades.</p>
      <p>“In recent years, the university has been proud to work alongside Alan in shining a light on the potential risks posed by heading in football.”</p>
      <p>Prof McCormac added that both football stars are “excellent role models” for the university’s students.</p>
