      <p>Their bittersweet music box of a film is enamored with its title character, a 93-year-old Mexican woman caught in an unwilling limbo. Her son has been sent to prison for failing to take care of her, elder neglect, leaving her unprepared adult grandsons to look after her, perhaps in the same way she looked after them when they were children. – <i>Jose S.</i> (<a href="https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/america-review-a-deeply-empathetic-bittersweet-portrait-of-family/">full review</a>)</p>

      <p>It probably says more about Ciro Guerra’s last film than this inimitable new offering (which he co-directed with his long-serving producer Christina Gallego) to suggest that fans of <i>Embrace of the Serpent </i>might find <i>Birds of Passage</i> just a little on the linear side. However, to compare the two is surely akin to comparing the varying potency of two strains of class-A hallucinogens. Set in Columbia in the 1960s, this violent, operatic, and sparsely trippy film follows the early days of marijuana trafficking in the region. Don’t worry if that all sounds a touch familiar. – <i>Rory O.</i> (<a href="https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/cannes-review-birds-of-passage-is-an-effectively-violent-crime-drama-from-an-indigenous-perspective/">full review</a>)</p>

      <p>There’s no better way to recognize what a filmmaker brings to the table than a sequel without him/her. This isn’t to say Ryan Coogler wasn’t involved in the making of <i>Creed II</i>—he is a producer on the project after all. No, it’s simply to point out how different <i>Creed</i> was to the <i>Rocky</i> films that came before it. Yes, it was pretty much a redux of the original installment that put Sylvester Stallone on Hollywood’s map as both a leading actor and screenwriter, but it relived those beats with a depth of character and emotion that transcended the nostalgic love we have for the Oscar-winner. Coogler and co-writer Aaron Covington lent a modern authenticity that moved beyond boxing to living life itself in the shadows of greatness. – <i>Jared M.</i> (<a href="https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/review-creed-ii-is-a-missed-opportunity-to-strengthen-a-rejuvenated-franchise/">full review</a>)</p>

      <p>From international stardom with <i>Star Tre</i>k to roles in films from Jeremy Saulnier, Paul Schrader, and Joe Dante, Garret Price’s new documentary <i>Love, Antosha</i>, covers all sides of Anton Yelchin, an actor taken too soon. We <a href="https://thefilmstage.com/features/love-antosha-filmmakers-on-celebrating-the-life-of-anton-yelchin/">spoke with</a> Price and producer Drake Doremus, who collaborated with the actor in <i>Like Crazy</i>, at the Sundance Film Festival about making their documentary shortly after Yelchin’s death. We also discussed the ethics of sharing his private diaries and erotic photos he took, along with industry-wide contributions of Yelchin material for the project.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><i>The Souvenir</i> melds two well-trodden subgenres and through Joanna Hogg’s refreshingly unique vision makes each feel entirely original. Her much-anticipated return after 2013’s <i>Exhibition </i>tells both a painful addiction story and a behind-the-scenes look at film school struggles as we follow Julie (a beautiful debut performance by Honor Swinton Byrne). The daughter of Tilda Swinton (who also briefly turns up), Swinton Byrne is in every scene, and steals them all. Akin to the revelatory introduction to Tom Hiddleston in Hogg’s first two films, <i>Unrelated </i>and<i> Archipelago</i>, she is the lifeblood of <i>The Souvenir</i>, which follows doomed lovers in a story that is conveyed with feels mined from achingly personal memories. – <i>Jordan R.</i> (<a href="https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/sundance-review-the-souvenir-is-an-invigoratingly-original-achingly-beautiful-drama/">full review</a>)</p>

      <p>It opens in slow motion with teenage bodies wrestling and punching inside chaotic dust swirls, one boy (Xabiani Ponce de León’s Carlos) caught isolated in the middle of the frame. He’s not looking to hit any of the others. In fact he’s barely dodging out of the way when they come too close. It’s almost as though Carlos isn’t even there, his mind and body separated as two halves of the same conflicted whole. He knows he should be present with his friends to show his machismo and do Mexico proud like the soccer team soon to hit the 1986 World Cup pitch, but something is calling him in the distance that he can’t quite see. It’s punk metal versus new wave blues, hetero-normative conformity versus queer counter-culture. – <i>Jared M.</i> (<a href="https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/sundance-review-this-is-not-berlin-is-a-drama-of-rebellious-power/">full review</a>)</p>

      </figure>
      <p>An evocative meditation on sight, cinema, and the tools of filmmaking, Rodney Evans’ latest feature documentary<i> Vision Portraits</i> is an intimate and generous look at what it means to reconfigure your art practice to accommodate your own disability. For Evans, who suffers from a rare retina condition that’s slowly eroding his peripheral vision, it’s using the landscape of the face to tell his stories rather than the traditional tools of mise-en-scene which considers all elements within the frame. – <i>John F.</i> (<a href="https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/sxsw-review-vision-portraits-is-a-personal-and-generous-look-at-creativity-in-darkness/">full review</a>)</p>
