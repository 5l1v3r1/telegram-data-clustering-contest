      <h2>The heavy downpours led to water spilling out of the sewage pumping station with flood waters forming on the road</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:43:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Reid</a></address>
      <p>Residents were left "disgusted" as raw sewage was detected in flood water in a Nottinghamshire village.</p>
      <p>Large parts of East Leake flooded on Thursday, November 14 after 13 hours of rainfall hit the county.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather">heavy downpours</a> led to water spilling out of the sewage pumping station, in Gotham Road, with flood waters forming on the road.</p>
      <p>Severn Trent Water explained what happened was known as a "hydraulic overload" - where there’s so much rain in such a short period of time that the sewer system can’t cope.</p>
      <p>The company sent a tanker to the pumping station overnight to prevent any more sewage escaping into the water.</p>
      <p>Linzi Barford, 43, has lived in the village for four-and-a-half years and said the sewage in the floods was a "public <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">health </a>risk".</p>

      <p>"I was disgusted by it," she added.</p>
      <p>"We all have big wellies and coats, but you shouldn't have to be walking through that and bringing it into your <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/property/">homes</a>.</p>
      <p>"I just want awareness raising on the issue. This has happened before in the village as well.</p>
      <p>"Flooding was everywhere in the village. I had to ring my other half to work out how I was going to get home. It was horrendous.</p>
      <p>"There are more houses approved for the village, which isn't going to help the situation."</p>
      <p>Another East Leake resident, Tom Kilman, 24, added: "It's gross thinking that there's raw sewage in the water.</p>
      <p>"Obviously no one wants that. The village suffers quite a lot from floods. The brook gets really high."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Severn Trent told Nottinghamshire Live: "After the huge amount of rain yesterday, we became aware of issues at the pumping station during the night and immediately got a tanker to site so we could remove waste before any more escaped.</p>
      <p>"Due to the sheer quantity of issues caused by the heavy rain, we’re prioritising internal flooding but will get clean-up crews out as soon as we can."</p>
