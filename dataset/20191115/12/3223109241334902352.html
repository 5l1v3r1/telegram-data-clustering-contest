      <h1>Watch: Real-Life Iron Man Smashes Jet-Powered Suit Record</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:55:52+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Move over, <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/florida-man-has-seen-avengers-endgame-116-times-and-counting-1792026/">Tony Stark</a>: Real-life Iron Man Richard Browning <a href="https://guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/11/real-life-iron-man-smashes-his-jet-powered-suit-record-by-flying-at-85-mph">just broke the record</a> for fastest speed in a body-controlled jet engine-powered suit (wind-guided) at 85.06 mph.</p>
      <p>The British inventor, founder of Gravity Industries, more than doubled the previous achievement of 32.02 mph—which he <a href="https://guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2017/11/qa-with-real-life-iron-man-richard-browning-as-discusses-his-jet-engine-suit-501862">set in 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>Against the colorful backdrop of Brighton Pier in South East England, Browning took to the sky Thursday as the showpiece for this year’s “Spirit of Adventure”-themed <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/gwrday">Guinness World Records Day</a>.</p>

      <p>The annual celebration sees thousands of people from around the world come together to become <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/this-guy-officially-has-the-worlds-largest-video-game-collection-1781024/">title holders</a>.</p>
      <p>Among them, Richard Browning, whose suit—the direction of which is controlled by body movement alone—propelled him to new heights (figuratively and literally speaking).</p>
      <p>“I’m really pleased,” he said after the flight.</p>
      <p>Browning completed two-way runs along the pier, the average speed of which was reported, to take into account inconsistencies like wind speed and direction.</p>

      <p>“I was confident we should be able to do it, but that’s very different to coming here and actually achieving it,” he said. “You can never discount the possibility of having a technical problem, so I’m really pleased we’ve delivered what we’ve done.”</p>
      <p>This week’s demonstration is actually the fastest Browning has ever flown: In training, he reached top speeds of about 75 mph.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t think we’d break what we did in training,” he said. “So I’m very chuffed.”</p>
      <p>Watching the first-person video captured by Browning’s helmet cam is intoxicating—until the feeling that I’m falling uncontrollably washes over me. Add to that the <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/amateur-inventor-creates-real-ish-iron-man-suit-1696129/">Doctor Octopus-esque suit</a> and my complete lack of core muscle, and I think I’ll just sit this one out.</p>

      <p>“It truly feels like that dream of flying you have sometimes in your sleep. You are entirely and completely free to move effortlessly in three dimensional space and you shed the ties of gravity,” Browning explained.</p>
      <p><s>Thankfully</s> Unfortunately for the rest of us, it will be a while before we’re experiencing the same freedom.</p>
      <p>“It’s not the future of transportation in its current form. It’s a bit like a Formula 1 car or the prices at fashion shows,” according to the inventor. “Neither are entirely practical but hopefully an inspiring and engaging insight into what the future might be.”</p>
