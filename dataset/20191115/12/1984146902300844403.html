      <h1>Are we really honouring the legacy of Frederick Douglass?</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle University's new teaching centre is named after anti-slavery campaigner, but Prof Nick Megoran asks if we should treat our workers better</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Megoran</a></address>
      <p>This week Newcastle hosted a very special ceremony: the opening of a Newcastle University teaching building named after the great anti-slavery activist (he himself being a freed slave) Frederick Douglass.</p>
      <p>But the event poses some uncomfortable questions for our city and its universities: are we really living up to the ideals that Douglass stood for?</p>
      <p>The opening ceremony was performed by Kenneth B Morris Jr, the great-great-great-grandson of Frederick Douglass himself. These celebrations follow on from the 2018 unveiling of a commemorative plaque in Summerhill Grove, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a>, where Douglass spent time at the home of local Christian abolitionists Anna and Henry Richardson.</p>
      <p>This followed on the heels of Freedom City 2017, a year of events to celebrate the 1967 bestowal of an honorary doctorate on Rev Martin Luther King Jr, culminating in the unveiling of a statue to King <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-university">at Newcastle University. </a>Newcastle thus has a special link to the African-American freedom struggle, and these connections are worth celebrating. But by casting ourselves as custodians of the legacies of the great men and women who struggled for freedom, we set ourselves a demanding standard to live up to.</p>

      <p>Sadly, in many ways we are failing to do this.</p>
      <p>The core idea at the heart of the life and work of Douglass and King was the biblical assertion that everyone, of every race and sex and background, was created ‘imago Dei’, or ‘in the image of God’.</p>
      <p>In his 1850 essay The Nature of Slavery, Douglass insisted that “The slave is a man, ‘the image of God.’” For Douglass, this was what made slavery so abominable, because “it is such a being that is smitten and blasted. Slavery… reduces man to a mere machine”.</p>
      <p>King was heavily influenced by Douglass’s views – indeed, he even attended Douglass’s former church, Boston’s historic Twelfth Baptist congregation. Updating Douglass’s argument, King claimed that segregation was wrong first and foremost because we are all made in God’s image.</p>
      <p>“The innate worth referred to in the phrase the ‘image of God’ is universally shared in equal portions by all,” said King, who argued that the human being “is not a thing. He must be dealt with not as an ‘animated tool,’ but as a person sacred in himself”.</p>

      <p>So, treating people well means respecting their humanity. Yet research shows that in many ways our workplaces across the North East are not doing this. Inspired by the writings of Douglass and King, I interviewed 55 workers in the North East’s public, educational and charity sectors.</p>
      <p>I asked them to construct a timeline of their working lives, drawing particular attention to times when they felt treated like a proper human being at work.</p>
      <p>I found a highly motivated workforce, who believe in the inherent value of what they are doing for the public good and thrive when trusted to do that. However, I also found a number of recurring practices that were deeply dehumanising. Our educational institutions provided good examples.</p>
      <h4>Educators in the North East</h4>
      <p>Teachers commonly pointed to how school managers responded to audit regimes – league tables, exams, and the dreaded Ofsted inspections – as dehumanising. Many staff felt that their headteachers prioritised targets over learning and education.</p>
      <p>School environments can become toxic as enormous pressure is piled on teachers to improve their results, even if circumstances (such as kids’ difficult home lives) meant that was beyond their control.</p>
      <p>With Government policy evaluating schools on the basis of ‘core’ subjects like maths and English, subjects such as RE, geography and music often become marginalised.</p>
      <p>This is dehumanising, one teacher told us, as “it gets implied that our contribution is less valuable because we don’t teach one of these valuable subjects”.</p>
      <p>Another commonly reported issue was that it becomes harder for female teachers going part-time for childcare reasons to secure leadership roles. Although the Department of Education encourages it, relatively few schools in our region appoint headteachers to part-time or job share roles.</p>

      <p>Moving from secondary to higher education, a recent report by the lecturers’ union UCU identified the ‘casualisation’ of university teaching and research work as a massive problem nationwide.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of staff are on fixed-term or zero-hours contracts, with women and those from ethnic minorities disproportionately more likely to be in precarious employment. Interviews with university lecturers across our region pointed to casualisation of labour as one of the most widespread dehumanising practices. Staff frequently reported being exploited. Many people told me they were given contracts of only nine or 10 months of the academic year, yet were expected to prepare teaching materials outside of these, unpaid.</p>
      <p>“This has become a standard practice,” one lecturer told me. Another spoke of being over-dependent on a manager who renewed her temporary contract each year, a manager who ignored her own career goals and forced her to accept ethically dubious practices.</p>
      <p>She described this as “the systematic destruction of my self-esteem and dismissal of my personal ambitions”.</p>
      <p>Being able to tell a story about our lives into the future is an important part of being human. Yet academics on repeated temporary contracts struggle to get mortgages, to put down roots, and to plan for families as they may not be entitled to maternity leave.</p>
      <p>Although these were described as “temporary contracts,” one lecturer told me, “they became my permanent career, there was nothing temporary about it”.</p>
      <h3>The magic power of human sympathy</h3>
      <p>Frederick Douglass believed progressive social change could occur only when those in power were forced to acknowledge the full, equal humanity of another by recognising common emotional experiences. He memorably called this “the magic power of human sympathy”.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is a distinct lack of that sympathy in many workplaces across our region. The North East is more dependent upon public-sector employment than any other English region. It is therefore especially important for us that we get this right.</p>
      <p>Yet too many of our dedicated public sector, education and charity workers experience work as dehumanising, being vulnerable to exploitation, denied promotion, bullied or marginalised over targets, and unable to plan for future family life.</p>
      <p>We should all welcome the efforts that many in Newcastle have made to remember and celebrate the lives of freedom champions, including today’s ceremony at Newcastle University.</p>
      <p>It is right that we honour the legacy of activists like King and Douglass. But uncomfortable questions are arising about whether we are truly honouring their legacies in deed as well as word.</p>
