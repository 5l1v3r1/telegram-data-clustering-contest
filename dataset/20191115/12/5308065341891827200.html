      <p>While his former lover, Taiwanese model Lin Chi-ling is getting hitched this coming weekend, Jerry Yan is finding it hard to meet girls and is still single.</p>
      <p>42-year-old Yan is acting in an upcoming Chinese series called Count Your Lucky Stars.</p>
      <p>Yan acts as an editor who woos a designer which is played by Shen Yue, a Chinese actress.</p>

      <p>After kissing accidentally, their fortunes change.</p>
      <p>What is irking netizens is that Shen is only 22 and the 20-year age difference is an issue.</p>
      <p>Netizens suggested that Yan and Shen play uncle and niece, which is more acceptable and believable instead of lovers when the shooting began in July.</p>
      <p>Some fans are okay that Yan still looks good for his age but are still uncomfortable with the age gap.</p>
      <p>In early November, the trailer for Count Your Lucky Stars was released and the issue of the age gap surfaced again.</p>
      <p>This negativity is a downer for Yan who is returning to acting after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament at a game of basketball back in December 2016.</p>
      <p>Yan’s fans call him a ‘vampire’ because he seems to have maintained his looks since Meteor Garden.</p>
      <p>“So, time has stopped for Jerry Yan? I see that the world is full of vampires. It feels like this is just his next drama after Meteor Garden. He looks just the same,” a Twitter user wrote after watching the trailer.</p>
      <p>Taiwanese boy band F4 together with Yan became popular in 2001 because of Meteor Garden.</p>
      <p>There is a line in his new drama that says: “If apologies were useful, why would we still need the police?” which reminds them of the same line Yan’s character Dao Ming Si used in Meteor Garden.</p>
      <p>Nostalgia is also celebrated with the casting of Shen who played the female lead in the 2018 remake of Meteor Garden.</p>
      <p>As for Yan, he is not counting his lucky stars when it comes to romance in real life.</p>
      <p>Lin and Yan dated in 2000 but broke up six years later. The model is marrying Japanese actor-singer Akira this weekend.</p>
      <p>Yan was reportedly sad when he heard about the marriage.</p>
      <p>Model Seanna Chang, who is Yan’s ex said that Yan confessed that Lin is the only woman in his heart.</p>
