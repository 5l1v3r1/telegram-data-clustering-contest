      <p>Whether users are looking to fulfill the demands of their high-end water-cooled systems, or to enjoy the benefits of water-cooled GPU and CPUs, Gigabyte Waterforce graphics card is the best choice. Waterforce WB graphics card is equipped with a top-of-the-line overclocked GPU certified by Gigabyte GPU Gauntlet™ sorting technology. It provides an all-around cooling solution for all key components of the graphics card. It takes care of not only the GPU but also VRAM and MOSFET to ensure stable overclock operation and longer durability. In addition, with excellent RGB lighting effects, protection metal back plate, Ultra-Durable top-grade materials and extended warranty for registered members, etc., Gigabyte Waterforce WB graphics card is the best choice for top players to pursue both quiet operation and performance.<br/><br/>In order to match the increasing number of high-end water-cooled motherboards on the market, GeForce® RTX 2080 SUPERTM GAMING OC Waterforce WB 8G is the best choice for graphics cards. Just invest a little more than the GAMING OC air-cooled version and you can enjoy the water cooling benefits for the GPU and CPU. Gigabyte offers top-of-the-line overclocked GPUs, an optimized water-loop design, factory-assembled professional quality, and excellent RGB lighting effects with the most important features of the official warranty, allowing players to enjoy high quality without any worries. For traditional graphics cards, not only does replacing the water cooling kit void the graphics card warranty but there’s also no guarantee that the graphics cards are compatible with 3rd-party customized water blocks. The professional design of a Gigabyte water block can quickly remove heat generated by the GPU, VRAM and MOSFET, keeping the graphics card cool and stable even when aggressively overclocked. <br/><br/>We want you to experience the best service you have ever had. This is why on top of our standard 3-year warranty, we would like to offer you an additional 1 year of protection to your graphics card free of charge. You can enjoy a 4-year warranty by registering on the website within 30 days of purchase.</p>
