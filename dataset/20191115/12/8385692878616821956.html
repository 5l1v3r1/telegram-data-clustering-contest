      <p>Today only, as part of Best Buy's early Black Friday Doorbusters, you can save a whopping $350 on the Samsung 70-inch 4K HDR TV. That brings the price down to just $549. And for a large screen TV like a 70-inch TV, this is definitely worth picking up.</p>
      <p>The Instant Pot LUX80 is back on sale in Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day today. This is for the eight quart model, so it'll be big enough to feed a family of up to 8. This is a 6-in-1 Instant Pot which can be used as a Programmable Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Sauté, Steamer, and Warmer.</p>
      <p>It's a good time to buy a new vacuum. Amazon has a couple of Tineco vacuums in its Gold Box Deal of the Day today. Allowing you to save up to 30-percent. On the Tineco A10 Hero – which is now $139. Or the Tineco PureOne S12 Stick Vac which is on sale for $399. These are going to be great for cleaning up your home around the holidays.</p>
