      <p>ROANOKE, Va. (AP) — A federal court filing says the mother of a wanted Marine told investigators that she saw her son kill her boyfriend.</p>
      <p>A criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Roanoke, Virginia, on Wednesday shows Vanessa Hanson told a U.S. Marshal that she witnessed Michael Alexander Brown fatally shoot her boyfriend, Rodney Wilfred Brown, last Saturday at a home in Hardy.</p>
      <p>According to the complaint, Hanson also identified Brown’s getaway vehicle through pictures obtained from a gas station just before the shooting. The vehicle was later found in Clarendon County in South Carolina.</p>
      <p>Brown was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before he left his post. He remains at large.</p>
      <p>A manhunt in Roanoke on Thursday forced school officials to cancel classes.</p>
