      <h1>Man City 'consider Leicester's Caglar Soyuncu and Jonny Evans' for January transfers</h1>
      <h2>Pep Guardiola's side have struggled at the back after an injury to Aymeric Laporte early in the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:26:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City are considering moves for Leicester City defenders Jonny Evans and Caglar Soyuncu in January, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The defending Premier League champions are looking to get their title challenge back on track after falling nine points behind leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> with a 3-1 defeat to Jurgen Klopp's side last weekend.</p>
      <p>City are currently fourth in the table and have struggled in defence during the early stages of the campaign after experiencing injury problems at the centre-back position.</p>
      <p>After failing to find a replacement for captain Vincent Kompany during the summer, Pep Guardiola suffered the added blow of losing star defender Aymeric Laporte to a serious knee injury in August.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has since frequently resorted to deploying midfielder Fernandinho in the heart of the defence and, although he has previously insisted he will not look to bolster his defensive options in January, City are reportedly monitoring a number of options.</p>

      <p>And according to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/transfer/news/11679/11861835/man-city-consider-jonny-evans-and-caglar-soyuncu">Sky Sports News</a> , both Evans and Soyuncu are on a list of potential defensive targets being considered by the defending champions ahead of the upcoming transfer window.</p>
      <p>The duo have started all 12 of Leicester's Premier League games together in the back four following Harry Maguire's £80million summer move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>And the pair have stepped up to form a reliable partnership to help establish Brendan Rodgers' side as early top four contenders.</p>

      <p>A 2-0 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> last weekend meant that the Foxes entered the current international break second in the Premier League, one point ahead of City.</p>
      <p>Former United defender Evans was the subject of interest from City in 2017 during his time at West Brom, with Guardiola's side reportedly seeing several bids rejected.</p>
      <p>The Northern Ireland international joined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> a year later for just £3.5m and has gone on to excel at the King Power Stadium, making 43 appearances in all competitions for the Foxes.</p>
