        <b>Parkmead, the Scottish energy firm headed by oil industry veteran Tom Cross, is actively looking at new opportunities to grow the business after hailing a return to the black fuelled by a strong performance from its Dutch gas fields.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Aberdeen-based company also said it was pressing ahead with plans to diversity into the renewable energy sector following a deal earlier this year to buy a significant parcel of farmland in the area.</p>

      <p>The group, which has interests in Scotland and the Netherlands, saw revenues increase by 18 per cent to £8.3 million in its latest financial year to 30 June and swung to an operating profit of £5.1m from a £5.3m loss in 2018.</p>
      <p>The figures were accompanied by news of a series of changes to its top team including Tim Coxe, who has previously worked for the firm as a contractor, joining in a new role of managing director, North Sea, to focus on developments including the Platypus gas area.</p>
      <p>The company said it was making good progress on plans for the development of the Platypus gas project which is expected to produce 47 million cubic feet of gas a day at peak production with a field life of approximately 20 years.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year the firm also announced a “strategic move” into renewable energy through the acquisition of Pitreadie Farm which owns land in Aberdeenshire.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Biomass</b>
      </p>
      <p>Parkmead said studies are now being conducted on the potential for a wind farm project, solar farm and a biomass production facility on the land.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands, the firm said production at the Diever West gas field was up 13 per cent during the year.</p>
      <p>Cash at the year end increased to £30.7m from £23.8m, helped by the sale of its stake in fellow Aberdeen-firm Faroe.</p>
      <p>Cross, executive chairman at the firm which has completed eight acquisitions in its history, said it was well positioned for further deals and is “looking carefully” at a number of new opportunities.</p>
      <p>He said the increase in revenue and major growth in cash flow and operating profit had been an “outstanding achievement” which creates a strong foundation.</p>
      <p>“Parkmead is well positioned for the future. We have excellent UK and Netherlands regional expertise, significant cash resources, and a growing portfolio of high-quality assets,” he said.</p>

      <p>“The group will continue to build upon the inherent value in its existing interests with a balanced, acquisition-led, growth strategy securing opportunities that maximise long-term value.”</p>
      <p>Other appointments made include Donald Wilson as financial controller and Kevin Mitchell who has been appointed as managing director of Parkmead’s economic consulting business Aupec.</p>
