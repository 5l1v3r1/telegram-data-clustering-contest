      <h1>'Experienced players that are earning very good money' - Barrow boss Ian Evatt's verdict on Notts County</h1>
      <h2>Bluebirds chief says Magpies have adapted well to non-league</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:45:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Barrow boss Ian Evatt believes Notts County are a big club for the National League and claimed they probably have a "big budget to go with it".</p>
      <p>The two clubs go head to head at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/meadow-lane">Meadow Lane</a> on Saturday with both sides in excellent form in what is shaping up to be an absorbing encounter.</p>
      <p>Barrow have won nine out of their last 10 games while Notts have lost just three of their last 19 matches which has put both sides in the frame for a promotion challenge this term.</p>
      <p>Evatt feels <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> have quickly got accustomed to the rigours of non-league football following relegation from the EFL last term, but feels given the size of the club, it is likely to be reflected in their spending power.</p>
      <p>“They’ve got some experienced players there that are earning very good money, for the National League," he said The Mail.</p>
      <p>“They’re a big club for this division, they probably have a big budget to go with it and high expectations to go with that.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy, this league, and they have adapted pretty quickly, as have Yeovil, but I can’t emphasise enough that my lot turn up and play the way they have been doing, then we’re more than a match for any team.”</p>
      <p>Barrow's away form makes them dangerous opponents for Notts given they have won five of their last six on the road.</p>
      <p>But it is likely to be their biggest test to date with Neal Ardley's side unbeaten at Meadow Lane since August.</p>

      <p>Notts is arguably the biggest fixture on every club's list in the National League this season given their terrific stadium, but Evatt says it is no greater than any other on Barrow's itinerary.</p>
      <p>“Every game is the same for me, really, other than ones that hold a personal connection, like Chesterfield, which is a personal fixture for me, but other than that, I treat them all the same," he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s obviously great for the fans to go to a big stadium and a big Football League club, in the past, with a lovely set-up. It’s something for them to look forward to.</p>
      <p>“But for me, it’s just another game and we’ll be going there trying to win, like we do with all of our games - we don’t go anywhere to draw.</p>
      <p>“I think the pitch and the stadium will really suit us. Notts County try to play good football, as do we, so it will be a good match, but one that we’ll definitely be looking forward to, with no fear.”</p>
