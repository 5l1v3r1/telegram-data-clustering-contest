      <h3>HOUSE Majority Leader and Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez yesterday expressed confidence that the resolution passed by the House of Representatives seeking to use the remaining P6.97-billion rice subsidy fund for the purchase of palay (unhusked rice) will somehow ease the suffering of local farmers, adding it is a pre-Christmas gift to them.</h3>
      <p>Romualdez was referring to House Joint Resolution (HJR) No. 22 that will utilize government funds from the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) for buying palay, which shall then be distributed to aid beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>He said the House of Representatives is sensitive to the plight of farmers, prompting its members to move for the direct purchase of palay from local farmers and distribute rice subsidy in the form of actual rice, instead of cash.</p>
      <p>“This is our malasakit (compassionate) way of ensuring that the Duterte administration is always there to help our farmers,” said Romualdez, one of the principal authors of HJR No. 22, after the House of Representatives with an overwhelming 206 votes approved the resolution on third and final reading last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Majority Leader also lauded the passage of the resolution amid the plunging prices of palay following the liberalization of the rice industry.</p>
      <p>It was the panel chaired by Quezon Rep. Mark Enverga which endorsed the resolution for plenary action upon the motion of Deputy Speaker and Abono party-list Rep. Conrad Estrella III that stemmed from HJR No. 322 filed by Romualdez and his wife, Tingog party-list Rep. Yedda Marie Romualdez and HJR No. 16 of Camarines Sur Rep. LRay Villafuerte.</p>
      <p>Villafuerte said the prompt and resolute action taken by both Chambers of Congress will enable the government to buy palay or unmilled rice directly from farmers to help them survive amid the weakening farmgate prices of the grain this harvest season.</p>
      <p>He lauded the House of Representatives and the Senate for passing their respective versions of a joint resolution (JR) authorizing the use of rice subsidy funds intended for conditional cash transfer (CCT) beneficiaries and uniformed personnel for the purchase of palay from local  farmers and subsequent distribution of rice to these target-recipients.</p>
      <p>“This is a pre-Christmas gift of the Congress to rice farmers now reeling from the steady softening of farmgate prices of palay this harvest season,” Villafuerte said after both Chambers passed their own versions of the palay-procurement measure.</p>
      <p>This resolution mandates that the P600 monthly subsidy for beneficiates of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) be handed over to the National Food Authority (NFA) for its palay-buying operations.</p>
      <p>Villafuerte said the NFA would then mill its newly acquired stocks and give out the rice to 4Ps beneficiaries, who would thus be getting rice instead of their monthly rice subsidies in cash, as is the current practice of the DSWD.</p>
      <p>The Senate has also passed its version of this measure requiring the DSWD to give rice instead of cash to 4Ps beneficiaries, with the rice coming from palay stocks bought from local farmers.</p>
      <p>According to the latest weekly price monitoring bulletin of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the average retail cost of well-milled rice fell to P41.89 per kilo and that of regular-milled rice to P37.22, in the second week of October.</p>
      <p>However, the farmgate price of palay also fell in the same period to an average of P15.53 a kilo, or the lowest since the P15.54 rate in November 2011.</p>
      <p>Villafuerte said the swift congressional approval of this palay-purchase plan would complement an initiative by President Duterte’s economic managers to distribute before Christmas P5,000 in cash assistance each to farmers affected by the low palay prices.</p>
      <p>According to the DA, the cash subsidy to rice farmers, which would amount to about P3 billion, will come from import duties collected from private rice imports as provided for under the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL).</p>
