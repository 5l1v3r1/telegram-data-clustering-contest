      <p>Steven Dickie was sentenced to a minimum of 23 years behind bars for his part in the murder of the 27-year-old last year.</p>
      <p>Prison officers discovered Dickie’s body at HMP Perth on Friday morning, according to the <a href="https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/exclusive-steven-donaldson-killer-found-dead-in-prison/?fbclid=IwAR1P7x6oHLRaIgcxcKDNtE4nMHJyyzLiTQxyytAJ12WazGpGUUV5nF8AZu4">Evening Telegraph</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-prison-service">Scottish Prison Service</a> have been approached for comment.</p>

      <p>Donaldson’s body was found battered and burned beside the charred shell of his BMW at Kirriemuir’s Loch of Kinnordy Nature Reserve in June 2018.</p>
      <p>An autopsy revealed that he had been stabbed, struck with a baseball bat and had his spine severed by a sword or machete.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/">Daily Record</a> previously reported that Dickie, along with Callum Davidson and Tasmin Glass would be appealing their sentences for their part in the death of Donaldson.</p>
