      <p>Airbourne continue their European charge with no-nonsense and no chance to catch your breath</p>
      <p>“Does anyone want a drink?” Airbourne frontman Joel O’Keefe asks Rock City, waving a bottle of Jack in the air with a large grin. It was a stupid question, we were there for rock music, of course we wanted a drink; it was to be a phenomenal night.</p>

      <p>The Aussie hard rock four-piece is renowned for rekindling lost embers of simple, hard-cutting, balls-to-the-wall rock and Rock City saw nothing less with an armada of bite-size bangers (Breakin’ outta Hell and Runnin’ Wild being highlights) that easily dwarfed any studio performance they’ve ever done; if you haven’t heard it live then you haven’t really heard it.</p>

      <p>Doused in a thick shroud of smoke and introduced by the Terminator 2 theme, O’Keefe (who started the night shirtless of course) and co. at times appeared more demon than man. Their frantic and vigorous tenacity to keep rock alive made for a fantastic show complete with air raid sirens and some heroic crowd singing from Nottingham’s best; well done fellas!</p>

      <p>Airbourne’s style may harken back to the days of AC/DC but they had no issue reeling in an assortment of ages. The fleet of battle jackets were proudly adorned by faces old and new, highlighting the band’s instantly accessible nature and a people’s undying love for rock and it’s unyielding attitude.</p>

      <p>Speaking of attitude, Airbourne delivered by the tonne. On his numerous breaks from guitar-slinging, O’Keefe was mounting security guards to ride high through the crowds, smashing beer cans with his temple, taking us to ‘bar school’ with his innovative Jack and Coke that amounted to 99% bourbon and even launching a seemingly interminable number of cups of beer to the most inaccessible corners of the venue to the sound of drunken cheers from fans below; it was like an alcoholic Olympics.</p>

      <p>Most importantly, Airbourne reminded us to stop caring. The arsenal of hits, the drinks, the frontman pep-talks, it was care-free enough to make even the most stiff-collared gent let loose. So yes, the music is by no means a pioneer within the genre but sometimes all you need is a dose of golden-age nostalgia; for that there’s no-one better than Airbourne.</p>
