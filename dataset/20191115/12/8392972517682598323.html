      <p>New photos of the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> campmates have teased the first lot of terrifying challenges.</p>
      <p>The likes of American TV star Caitlyn Jenner, former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actress Jacqueline Jossa and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> presenter Kate Garraway are heading into the Aussie jungle this weekend.</p>
      <p>But it seems the stars have already been through their paces with their first lot of challenges, which will be shown during the launch this Sunday.</p>

      <p>The pictures show some of the stars, which appear to be in a team, diving off a boat.</p>
      <p>In the photo, James Haskell, Nicole Coyle, Kate, Ian Wright and Myles Stephenson were seen jumping into the water.</p>
      <p>As they were diving, hosts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> yelled at them through a megaphone on the beach.</p>

      <p>As the celebs swam around, Ant and Dec gave them instructions from the shore.</p>
      <p>As they finally made it to shore and waded out of the water, the team were seen relaxing on the beach completely drenched.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week, it was reported that the launch was under threat because of the deadly bushfires that have been sweeping parts of Australia over the past couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>The show bosses said they will "closely monitor" the fires ahead of the launch.</p>
      <p>However, due to the fires, it may mean the campfire - which the celebrities use to cook and keep warm - is banned.</p>

      <p>The NSW Rural Fire Service has been keeping locals updated on the fires and has imposed a strict fire ban until it becomes less intense.</p>
      <p>Their website states: "Bush fires are more likely to spread and cause damage on days when the weather is very hot, dry and windy. These are usually on very high to extreme fire days.</p>
      <p>"To reduce the risk of fires damaging or destroying life, property and the environment the NSW RFS Commissioner may declare a Total Fire Ban (TOBAN). In a Total Fire Ban no fire may be lit in the open and all fire permits are suspended."</p>

      <p>A show source told us: "We're monitoring the situation on an hourly basis and have contingencies in place for all eventualities."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the programme added: "We are in constant contact with the NSW fire brigade and are closely monitoring the situation. The health and safety of all our production crew and celebrities are the utmost important."</p>
