      <h1>McLaren Elva Will Still Be Street Legal Without A Windshield</h1>
      <h2>The windshield will be required in certain states but it doesn't look as special.</h2>

      <p>McLaren just pulled the wraps off its <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/meet-the-mclaren-elva-mclarens-lightest-road-car-ever">latest Ultimate Series hypercar</a>, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mclaren/elva">Elva</a>. Powered by a twin-turbo V8 producing 803 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, the Elva should be even faster than the previous Ultimate Series car, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mclaren/senna">Senna</a>, due to its lightweight construction. McLaren is estimating a 0-62 mph time of under three seconds and no matter what the final top speed ends up being, it should feel pretty mad doing it without a windshield or roof (depending on where you live).</p>
      <p>Other recent hypercars without a windshield include the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/ferrari-monza-sp1-and-sp2-are-not-street-legal-in-the-us">Ferrari SP1 and SP2</a>, which are not street legal in the United States due to safety regulations. But unlike the two Ferraris, McLaren will offer the Elva with an optional windshield and the company says the car has been homologated for all major markets. A McLaren spokesperson has told CarBuzz that you can order the car without a windshield and "the laws vary depending on the state."</p>

      <p>All of the initial press photos of the Elva showed the car without a windshield but now the UK automaker has released a single image (pictured above) of what it will look like with the optional windshield in place. McLaren tells us the windshield will be "available at no cost" and it will "make some tweaks to the aero" to accommodate the new piece of glass.</p>
      <p>Straight from the photo, we can already see the scoop in the hood will be deleted with the windshield in place. The Elva's Active Air Management System is designed to direct the air through the nose out of the vent on the clamshell hood and over the cockpit. Perhaps the glass windshield renders this system irrelevant, which is why it no longer has the vent on the hood.</p>

      <p>Depending on where you live in the US, you may not have a choice of whether or not you can order the Evla without a windshield. But if you do live in a state or country that does allow it, we highly suggest ordering your car as McLaren initially intended. The windshield car is still a beautiful piece of machinery but part of the "wow factor" is taken away. If you can, opt for the car without a windshield and get a nice racing helmet painted to match your $1.69 million hypercar.</p>
