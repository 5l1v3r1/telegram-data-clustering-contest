      <h3>AN off-duty cop assigned at the Eastern Police District (EPD) who just came from a drinking session in a bar was nabbed by fellow policemen for illegal discharge of firearm in Pasig City Thursday morning.</h3>
      <p>Pasig Police chief, Col. Moises Villaceran Jr., identified the cop as Staff Sergeant Percilito Club, 39, assigned at the District Special Operations Unit (DSOU).</p>
      <p>Villaceran said Club was arrested after he fired his gun near the parking area of the Reserve Liquor Lounge, City Golf, located along J. Vargas Avenue Bgy. Ugong, Pasig City at around 5:20 a.m.</p>
      <p>Based on a police report, members of Police Community Precint (PCP-10} was conducting patrol at the area when they heard a  gunshot  near the bar prompting them to check .</p>
      <p>When policemen arrived they saw a male person holding a firearm.</p>

      <p>Responding policemen placed Club under arrest. Recovered from him a caliber Glock 17 with serial number PNP 19333 and one magazine loaded with 14 live ammunitions.</p>
      <p>According to Villaceran, Club just came from a drinking session with his civilian friends at the Reserve Liquor Lounge.</p>
      <p>“Galing daw sa inuman yung pulis  kasama yung mga kaibigan nya nagsabi daw ng problema yung pulis sa mga kaibigan tungkol sa pamilya nya, kaya napagkwentuhan iyon habang nag-iinuman,” Villaceran told reporters.</p>
      <p>After their drinking session, his friends went home, followed by Club a few minutes later.</p>
      <p>While Club was walking towards the parking area, he pulled his service firearm and fired a shot in the ground.</p>
