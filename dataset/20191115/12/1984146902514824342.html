      <p>Hundreds of pupils have been told to stay at home after a dreaded winter bug virus swept across school.</p>
      <p>This week St Mary’s RC Voluntary Aided Primary School in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jarrow">Jarrow</a>, South Tyneside, had an increased number of children reported ill with suspected norovirus and have been issuing information to parents.</p>
      <p>But as the situation got worse the decision was made to close the school on Thursday and Friday with all staff and pupils being told to return on Monday.</p>
      <p>There are 205 pupils at the primary school, 33 in the nursery and over 20 teachers.</p>
      <p>The school has posted vital information from the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nhs">South Tyneside and Sunderland National Health Trust</a> setting out what is norovirus and what to do if you have it.</p>
      <p>The guidelines says the winter vomiting bug is highly infectious and is most active between December and March. The symptoms include projectile vomiting, watery diarrhoea and stomach cramps. It says pupils and staff who have norovirus must not return to school until 48 hours after the symptoms have ended.</p>
      <p>School bosses hope the weekend should give sufferers enough time to get over their illnesses. Meanwhile the school is getting a “deep clean” to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
      <p>On Thursday on the school’s <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page it said: “Due to a large number of staff and children absent with suspected norovirus, we have been advised to close school and nursery. Please arrange to have your child collected as soon as possible. We will keep you updated through texts and Facebook. Thank you”</p>
      <p>It then posted: “School will close today and tomorrow due to a bug, if you have not already done so please collect your child from school asap thank you.”</p>
      <p>The South Tyneside Council website said: “St Mary’s RC VA Primary School, Ayr Drive, Jarrow is closed today (Friday 15 November 2019) due to the Norovirus infection. The school needs a deep clean. It is expected that the school will re-open on Monday 18 November 2019.”</p>
      <p>Executive headteacher, Marie Graham, said: “Numbers of children with a sickness bug has lead us to close the school due to a suspected outbreak of norovirus, whilst not confirmed as norovirus, protocols have been followed in consultation with Public Health and Leaders of the Trust.</p>
      <p>“An industrial cleaning company have been enlisted to conduct a deep clean of all areas of the school and we will reopen on Monday.”</p>
      <p>Public Health England North East’s health protection team and South Tyneside Council are now working with the school after receiving reports of vomiting and respiratory symptoms amongst pupils.</p>
      <p>Dr Gayle Dolan, consultant in health protection for PHE NE, said: “At this time of year it is not uncommon for viruses including influenza (flu) and norovirus to circulate in the community and in schools.</p>
      <p>“The risk of infection can be reduced by practising good hand hygiene, particularly after using the toilet, after using a tissue to catch a cough or a sneeze, and before eating.</p>
      <p>“Children who have been suffering with vomiting and diarrhoea should not return to school until at least 48 hours after symptoms have passed. Children who are feeling unwell but have not had symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea should only return to school once they are fully recovered.</p>
      <p>“If you are concerned about your child’s symptoms, or need further advice on how to manage an illness please consult your GP or NHS 111 in the normal way.”</p>
      <p>The school closure comes after <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/health-officials-called-fever-vomiting-17251800">ChronicleLive reported on Wednesday</a>, how Public Health England North East (PHE NE) health protection team confirmed they have been working with staff at Kells Lane Primary School in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/low-fell">Low Fell</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead,</a> after a large number of pupils were struck down with a fever and vomiting outbreak.</p>
      <p>We then reported how <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/gateshead-schoolchildren-sent-home-over-17257125">children were turned away</a> from Ravensworth Terrace Primary School in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/birtley">Birtley</a> after an airborne virus killer machine malfunctioned, sending out too much dangerous disinfectant ozone gas into the building.</p>
      <p>The school deployed its own ‘bug cleaning’ device to clean the air after a sickness outbreak.</p>
