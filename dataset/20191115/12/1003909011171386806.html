      <h1>Varcoe: Provincial pension plan holds 'substantial benefit’ for Albertans, internal AIMCo report shows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:00:48+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Varcoe, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Would Albertans really be better off with a new provincial pension plan, replacing the Canada Pension Plan?</p>
      <p>It’s a critical question the Kenney government will grapple with in the coming months, but an internal report by the Alberta Investment Management Corp. (AIMCo) tackles the issue and indicates a case can be made.</p>
      <p>By withdrawing from CPP, Albertans would see “a substantial benefit” as their costs to contribute to a provincial plan would drop, states the report, obtained by Postmedia.</p>
      <p>The 19-page analysis was completed in September and calculates a sustainable pension contribution rate would fall to 7.21 per cent (and possibly lower) from current CPP base plan levels of 9.9 per cent, if an Alberta plan was established.</p>
      <p>“An Alberta pension plan would lower contributions … relative to current CPP contributions for an equivalent set of benefits,” the report states.</p>
      <p>“However, we note that the result is very sensitive to how certain assumptions play out over the years.”</p>
      <p>The idea of Alberta opting out of CPP has been discussed for years, but <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/alberta-premier-says-proposal-to-pull-out-of-cpp-due-to-hostility-from-others/wcm/2f7c395b-1010-4dd5-aa58-1e895129ede0">regained momentum last month</a> after Premier Jason Kenney said a “<a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/fp-street/alberta-will-study-already-compelling-case-for-its-exit-from-cpp-kenney/wcm/1646ac25-35c7-43fd-bc2f-b6396cdebcf6">compelling case</a>” could be made for the shift.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Kenney said his government’s new “fair deal” panel will examine a number of proposals to advance Alberta’s interests, including the potential creation of a pension plan.</p>
      <p>Provinces have the ability to opt out of CPP and provide comparable benefits. While Quebec set up its own pension plan in the 1960s, no province has opted out of CPP since it was created.</p>
      <p><a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/calgary-chamber-of-commerce-head-unimpressed-with-kenneys-fair-deal-proposal/wcm/d0b2050a-7e91-4aa0-86b1-fbfce99d9837">Issues such as</a> the costs to create and administer it, how portable a provincial plan would be and Alberta’s share of CPP assets are key questions that would need to be resolved.</p>
      <p>Kenney said about $40 billion of Alberta premiums could be repatriated, while AIMCo, a provincial Crown corporation, would administer a provincial pension fund.</p>
      <p>AIMCo has more than $115 billion of assets under its management and is responsible for 31 pensions, endowments and government funds.</p>
      <p>If the idea was adopted, demographics would assist Alberta’s pension proposal, as the province has a younger population than the rest of Canada to support benefits, but other factors such as wages, net migration and labour market participation are also important, the report notes.</p>
      <p>“Alberta clearly has the population best suited to sustaining a pay-as-you-go pension plan with its high working-age population and relatively low retired population share,” it states.</p>
      <p>Depending on how much would be transferred into the Alberta pension plan from CPP, a larger amount ($54.5 billion) would mean Alberta’s sustained contribution rate could be as low as 6.85 per cent, according to the study.</p>
      <p>“This is … a substantial benefit for Albertans, reducing the effective level of taxation within Alberta and increasing Alberta’s tax advantage,” the report states.</p>
      <p>If Alberta withdrew from the Canadian plan, contribution rates in the rest of the country would need to rise to 10.41 per cent, according to the report.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Denes Nemeth of AIMCo said the analysis for the independent investment management agency “was internally prepared for (and) intended for internal use only.”</p>
      <p>He said the corporation conducted the study after a Fraser Institute report in April looked at the feasibility of a provincial pension plan, and AIMCo’s analysis was intended “to better understand the implications of a possible APP for all Albertans.”</p>
      <p>Economist Jack Mintz, president’s fellow at the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy, said the AIMCo study makes a “good stab” at trying to understand the complex matter.</p>
      <p>“The overall point is that Alberta will be able to have a lower contribution rate, if the Alberta pension plan was created and people in Alberta could belong to that, as opposed to the Canada Pension Plan,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They pay less and they get the same benefits. It sounds like a good deal.”</p>

      <p>But any proposal to proceed with an Alberta pension plan will face resistance and skepticism, from within and outside of the province.</p>
      <p>In 2003, the Klein government set up a panel of MLAs to examine the idea as part of a broader set of federal-provincial issues.</p>
      <p>The committee noted opponents of an Alberta pension program were concerned it would face higher risks because of its reliance on a smaller population of contributors — and the possibility the province’s demographics “could shift quickly and significantly.”</p>
      <p>“The committee believes that withdrawing from the CPP and creating a separate Alberta pension plan is not in the best interests of Albertans,” the committee concluded.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the AIMCo study noted contribution rates are affected by demographic and economic variables.</p>
      <p>“Consider a scenario where the Alberta energy sector collapses and results in a significant net migration of working age people out of Alberta,” it states. “Under this scenario, Alberta may have been better off remaining in the CPP.”</p>
      <p>Keith Ambachtsheer, director emeritus of the University of Toronto’s Rotman International Centre for Pension Management, said while AIMCo can manage the assets for Alberta’s pension plan, new infrastructure would be required for the benefits administration side, costing millions of dollars annually to operate.</p>
      <p>Withdrawing from CPP would also move Alberta into uncharted water, leaving both sides trying to “unscramble the omelette, and it’s going to be costly and it’s going to take a long time and the benefits are not obvious.”</p>
      <p>Ambachtsheer pointed out any funds transferred from CPP into the province’s plan wouldn’t be “free money” as an Alberta pension plan would have to be sustainable for decades into the future.</p>
      <p>“It’s not clear to me you just automatically lower your contribution rate,” he said.</p>

      <p>Mintz said the AIMCo analysis indicates the idea warrants further consideration.</p>
      <p>“There is still probably more work to be done,” he added.</p>
      <p>“If Alberta feels they’d like to get out of the (CPP) program because they feel they can manage the assets at a lower cost, plus provide a payroll tax cut for their population, I think it’s a fairly strong slam dunk in favour of the policy.”</p>
