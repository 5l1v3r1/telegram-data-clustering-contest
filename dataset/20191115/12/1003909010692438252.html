      <h1>Smith: Trudeau can bridge gap between Alberta and Quebec — and cut GHG</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:10:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author">Danielle Smith</a></address>
      <p>It may come as a surprise, but my name wasn’t on the shortlist of westerners to be tapped to give Prime Minister Justin Trudeau advice on how to address issues in the West, but I’m going to give it to him anyway.</p>
      <p>Former federal justice minister Anne McLellan is as good a choice as any. She did an able job of examining what went wrong in the SNC-Lavalin debacle and gave a list of guidelines to ensure an attorney general would not face undue pressure again. Many in the energy sector know her and like her.</p>
      <p>But we shouldn’t be fooled into thinking this is a genuine exercise in addressing grievances. If Trudeau wanted to know how to address western alienation, he would have fine counsel in premiers Jason Kenney and Scott Moe. I think he just wants to know how the Liberals could win seats again in Alberta.</p>
      <p>It’s clear to me all that really matters to the prime minister is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and winning seats in Quebec.</p>
      <p>It may seem that satisfying the interests of both Alberta and Quebec is impossible.</p>
      <p>Kenney and Bloc Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet went toe to toe this week. Blanchet told Vassy Kapelos on Power and Politics <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://twitter.com/PnPCBC/status/1194751147891994624__;!9uxzVPOYHkA!TTkZlCPEnUX7I3Al98ZnY7W1KN7MYICwcDH9Fivqebm9y-RpLMbtgpJEYRUdn7o8%24">that Quebec has enough Alberta oil</a>: “Our needs are fulfilled … there is no reason for Quebec to support being simply a territory that you cross in order to increase the exportation of Canadian oil.” Kenney responded with “<a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/bloc-leader-blanchet-shows-little-sympathy-for-calls-for-western-independence-as-he-meets-trudeau/wcm/f96cdc3a-74cc-4c41-a5fe-4e4a676f446a">pick a lane.</a>” Quebec can’t oppose Alberta’s energy development and then benefit from Ottawa’s over-taxation of Alberta’s energy workers. (Let’s remember, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610045001&amp;pickMembers*5B0*5D=1.10&amp;pickMembers*5B1*5D=2.2__;JSUlJQ!9uxzVPOYHkA!TTkZlCPEnUX7I3Al98ZnY7W1KN7MYICwcDH9Fivqebm9y-RpLMbtgpJEYeqDe74n%24">in 2018</a> Alberta generated $46 billion in federal taxes and received only $29 billion in federal spending; meanwhile, Quebec generated $60 billion in federal taxes and received $73 billion in federal spending.)</p>
      <p>The challenge for the prime minister is to simultaneously satisfy Kenney and Blanchet. There is nothing to be gained by siding with either the Greens or the NDP.</p>
      <p>The Greens rendered themselves irrelevant by winning only three seats. The NDP lost seats and popular vote everywhere, but most dramatically in Quebec. Jagmeet Singh’s main condition for supporting Trudeau, a national pharmacare program, is likely to be rejected by Alberta and Quebec for the same reasons. It’s provincial jurisdiction and it’s not Ottawa’s job.</p>
      <p>So this is the trick: how does the prime minister meet Alberta’s interests to develop its energy sector while meeting Quebec’s demands to aggressively reduce greenhouse gases?</p>
      <p>The first step is to get all parties to agree to the net-zero target for greenhouse gas emissions. What does net zero mean? It means we have to reduce or offset all of Canada’s 716 megatonnes of annual carbon dioxide emissions. It can be done and here’s how:</p>
      <p>First, maintain the carbon dioxide tax on big emitters and accept Kenney’s idea for flow-through shares to fund the adoption of green technologies. That would give both the stick and the carrot to adopt carbon capture technology and use cleaner fuels.</p>
      <p>Second, follow through on planting two billion trees. Consider: <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/treesofstrength/treefact.htm__;!9uxzVPOYHkA!TTkZlCPEnUX7I3Al98ZnY7W1KN7MYICwcDH9Fivqebm9y-RpLMbtgpJEYQIAXFMx%24">one tree can sequester one tonne of emissions over 40 years</a>. In theory, two billion trees will sequester 2,000 megatonnes. Recruit farmers and ranchers to improve carbon sequestration in grasslands and soils and the opportunities for capture are even greater.</p>
      <p>Three, make Canada a world leader in the export of natural gas to displace coal in China and India. It is estimated LNG Canada alone could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-perception-is-not-reality-canadas-energy-sector-is-best-in-the-world">by 60 to 90 megatonnes</a>. The <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://unfccc.int/news/clean-development-mechanism-passes-new-milestone__;!9uxzVPOYHkA!TTkZlCPEnUX7I3Al98ZnY7W1KN7MYICwcDH9Fivqebm9y-RpLMbtgpJEYa7oKzLF%24">Clean Development Mechanism </a>in the <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf__;!9uxzVPOYHkA!TTkZlCPEnUX7I3Al98ZnY7W1KN7MYICwcDH9Fivqebm9y-RpLMbtgpJEYV62qCbL%24">Paris Agreement</a> allows us to get credit for doing things like this.</p>
      <p>Taken together, we could probably reduce our emissions by more than 716 megatonnes. I bet a net-zero target is within reach in a matter of years. Heck, if Trudeau becomes the first country to get there, the United Nations might even reward him with a seat on the Security Council.</p>
      <p>A net-zero target reframes the debate about building new pipelines in Alberta and new cement, aluminum and steel plants in Quebec. It’s not a question of whether new industrial projects will increase emissions. It’s a question of how we will offset any increase that may result.</p>
      <p>There is a way to bridge the gap between Alberta and Quebec. If Trudeau wants to demonstrate he has the chops to solve the national unity crisis, the answers are right there.</p>
