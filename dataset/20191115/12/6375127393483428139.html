      <h1>Wright does it right</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:15:10+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/arman-carandang" target="_blank">Arman Carandang</a></address>
      <h3>ONE last play inside the last 3.7 seconds. That was what Phoenix needed to ensure some sort of happy ending to its campaign in the 2019 PBA Governors' Cup.</h3>
      <p>And the Fuel Masters had Matthew Wright to thank for.</p>
      <p>Wright sank a buzzer-beating triple in overtime to lift the Fuel Masters past Blackwater, 120-117, in a battle of cellar-dwellers on Friday at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.</p>
      <p>Easily the most consistent among the Phoenxi locals, Wright finished with 28 points and his two freethrows of Don Trollano foul witgh 11.1 seconds in overtime gave Phoenix a 117-114 lead which Roi Sumang tied for Blackwater in the return play with two freethrows off Alex Mallari.</p>
      <p>Phoenix sued for time to draw a game-winning play and was lucky enough the Fuel Masters were able to carry out their last play that saw Wright heave the biggest shot in the night.</p>
      <p>The triple shattered the 117-all standoff and lifted Phoenix to its third win in all its 11 outings in the season-ending conference.</p>
      <p>It was also Wright who sent the game in overtime with a triple in front of Blackwater's Marqus Blakely in the last 2.6 seconds.</p>
      <p>The Elite closed their elimination campaign with 2-9 slate.</p>
      <p>Back-to-back triples by Matthew Wright enabled Phoenix to move within 107-106 with 16.2 seconds remaining in regulation.</p>
      <p>As Phoenix was already in penalty, Roi Sumang, who fished a quick foul in the ensuing play, canned in two freethrows as Blackwater wrested the lead, 109-16, with 8.6 seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>Phoenix then took no time to make the inbound and Wright, who was left open from the rainbow territory, immediately went for an attempt, hitting its target to send the game in overtime, 109-all.</p>
      <p>The Elite quickly erased the 22-16 Phoenix first quarter lead as KG Canaleta sank three booming triples, with Mac Belo adding one three-pointer and Roi Sumang two baskets in Blackwater blitz.</p>
      <p>That Blackwater rampage spanning about five minutes enabled the Elite to wrest the upperhand at 32-29 with 7:45 left. The Fuel Masters fought back behind JC Intal, Dough Kramer, Matthew Wright and Alonzo Gee to wrest the lead at 43-39, before the Elite outscored them anew to take the half, 46-45.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Talk â€˜N Text plays Magnolia at 5 p.m. today in a lone Petron Saturday Game Special at the University of Southern Philippines in Davao City.</p>

      <p>Phoenix 120 - Gee 34, Wright 28, Garcia 17, Mallari 10, Intal 9, Chua 9, Perkins 4, Jazul 3, Kramer 3, Napoles 2, Gamboa 1, Marcelo 0.</p>
