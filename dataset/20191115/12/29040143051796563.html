      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Huawei's first foldable phone, the Mate X finally went on sale in China earlier today, without Google apps.</li>
        <li>The smartphone was sold out within minutes during the first sale.</li>
        <li>It is priced at 16,999 yuan ($2,400) in China.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Huawei's foldable <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-mate-x">Mate X</a> finally went on sale (via <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/11/15/business/ap-as-china-huawei.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a>) in China today, nearly nine months after its introduction at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The phone was originally expected to go on sale in June but Huawei decided to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-pushes-back-mate-x-launch-september-conduct-extra-tests">delay</a> the release in order to conduct some "extra tests."</p>
      <p>Due to the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-android-ban-mate-30-no-google-apps-will-your-phone-still-get-updates">U.S. blacklist</a>, however, the Mate X is shipping without any Google apps or services. Huawei's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-mate-30-pro-review">Mate 30</a> series, which was launched in August, is also currently being shipping without Google apps. While the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-may-get-another-90-day-reprieve-us-commerce-department">second 90-day reprieve</a> granted to Huawei by the Commerce Department is set to expire on November 18, the U.S. government is <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-companies-will-be-granted-licenses-trade-huawei-very-shortly">expected</a> to soon issue licenses to American firms so they can resume trade with the Chinese company.</p>
      <p>The Mate X doesn't use any major components from U.S. suppliers either. Instead of a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, the foldable phone is powered by a HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipset and uses the Balong 5000 modem.</p>
      <p>Huawei has priced the Mate X at 16,999 yuan ($2,400) in China, making it more expensive than its main rival, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-fold">Samsung Galaxy Fold</a>. The Mate X features a 6.6-inch display on the front and a 6.38-inch display on the back. When the phone is unfolded, the screen size increases to 8 inches. It also comes with triple cameras, 8GB of RAM, 512GB storage, and a dual-cell 4,500mAh battery with 55W fast charging.</p>
