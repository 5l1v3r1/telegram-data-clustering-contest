        <i>Block is designed to prevent problem gamblers betting money they can’t afford to lose</i>
      </p>
      <p>Halifax has joined <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/hsbcholdings">HSBC</a> in announcing customers can now self-exclude their bank cards from being used to gamble – and if they change their mind they won’t be able to start spending again for another 48 hours.</p>
      <p>The block is designed to prevent problem gamblers betting money they can’t afford to lose and restrict impulsive behaviour. It lets them prevent their cards being used at bookmakers and gambling websites.</p>
      <p>Halifax customers who have opted in to the service will not have their cards “unfrozen” for 48 hours, to help “protect those who might otherwise make an impulsive return to gambling”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/13/hsbc-to-let-customers-block-spending-on-gambling-websites">HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/13/hsbc-to-let-customers-block-spending-on-gambling-websites">said earlier this week</a> its 14.5 million UK customers can now self-exclude from all gambling transactions. The restriction can only be reversed after a 24-hour cooling-off period.</p>
      <p>HSBC says about 500,000 customers placed bets every month in 2018, spending an average of £52.50. It received more than 12,000 calls about gambling last year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/gambling">Gambling</a> behaviour expert Dr Heather Wardle said: “The financial sector is a key enabler of the gambling industry – without them online gambling couldn’t exist. It’s right that banks and other financial institutions take the protection of people from gambling harms seriously.”</p>
      <p>High-street lender NatWest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/30/natwest-to-offer-help-to-gambling-addicts-in-high-street-branches">said last month</a> that it would offer counselling sessions for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/11/people-dying-campaign-gambling-public-health-concern">gambling addicts</a> inside branches as part of a pilot scheme that could be rolled out across the country.</p>
      <p>Lenders such as Monzo, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/11/barclays-mobile-banking-gambling-drinking-app">Barclays</a> and Starling also allow customers to block gambling transactions on their bank accounts or credit cards,</p>
      <p>Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and MBNA also offer card freeze features providing customers more choice and support in this area. More than 15,000 debit and credit card customers across these four brands have already signed up to the new gambling card controls since launch at the end of October.</p>
