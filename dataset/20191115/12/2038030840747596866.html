      <p>Cape Town - It’s been a year since Kim Porter, Sean “Diddy” Combs’ ex-girlfriend died. </p>
      <p>The model and actress died of lobar pneumonia at the age of 47.</p>
      <p>Kim and the American rapper were no longer together when she died, but they had three children together, Christian (21) and twin girls Jesse and D'Lila (12). Diddy also helped her raise son Quincy Brown (28) from a previous relationship.</p>
      <p>Diddy (50) has been outspoken about how her loss has affected him and their family, <b>Essence</b> reports. Now, on the anniversary of her death, the businessman has honoured the mother of his children on Instagram by posting a picture of a broken heart. He captioned it with her initials.</p>

      <p>In an April interview with <a href="https://www.essence.com/feature/diddy-family-over-everything-after-death-kim-porter/"><b>Essence</b></a> where Diddy did a shoot with his six children, he said ever since Kim’s passing he’s learnt to be a more present father to his children.</p>
      <p>“Before this, I was a part-time father, you know? My family was always first, but there are countless times when I chose work over everything else,” he said. “But every day I can hear her telling me to go and spend some time with the kids and make sure everybody’s all right, like she would do. I’m just a lot more present, and, most important, now my kids come before anything else in my life.”</p>
