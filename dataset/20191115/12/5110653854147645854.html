      <p>The 35-year-old forward has been working to get back into the league ever since being waived last February by the Bulls, who had acquired him a trade with theRockets. He recently expressed confidence that he would land with a team.</p>
      <p>Anthony will give Portland a scoring threat at power forward in the absence of the injured Zach Collins. Even in a diminished role the past two seasons, Anthony averaged 16.2 and 13.4 points, respectively. He is a career 24.0-point-per game scorer.</p>
      <p>Yahoo Sports' <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBHaynes/status/1195160868385771520">ChrisÂ Haynes reported</a> that Blazers star point guard Damian Lillard is on board with the move.</p>
      <p>Two of Anthony's best buds, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade,were also pleased to learn the news</p>
