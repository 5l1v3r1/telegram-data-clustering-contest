      <p>One year ago yesterday (November 14th, 2018), the price of Bitcoin (BTC) began to tank. During that day, the cryptocurrency fell from $6,200 — where it had held for a majority of the summer months — to $5,500, a 12% drop that was the worst daily performance for the asset in over two months.</p>

      <h3>One Year Anniversary of the Bitcoin Crash</h3>
      <p>September to November of 2018 was a weird time for the cryptocurrency markets; then, a majority of analysts were leaning long, as Bitcoin had managed to hold $6,000 for months on end, leaving many to suggest that this level was a long-term bottom.</p>
      <h4>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/14/former-ecb-presidents-statement-shows-bitcoin-does-have-impact-on-the-economy/">Former ECB President’s Statement Shows Bitcoin Does Have Impact on the Economy</a></h4>
      <p>Though, on the morning of November 14th, this was proven not to be the case. As aforementioned, BTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/12/01/november-has-been-bitcoins-worst-month-for-seven-years/">collapsed by 12% out of nowhere</a>, falling after months of consolidation in a seeming bottoming pattern.</p>
      <p>The exact cause of the plunge was never pinpointed, though it coincided with the start of a hash rate war between Craig Wright’s and Jihan Wu’s camps in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem, and capitulation of BTC miners and other industry members.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s -12% performance on that one fateful day triggered a four-week move that eventually brought the cryptocurrency as low as $3,100 — depending on what exchange you check —  by the middle of December.</p>
      <p>The eight-week period between the middle of November and the start of January was arguably the most apathetic the cryptocurrency market had been in years, with cryptocurrency firms <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/04/13/crypto-wallet-ledger-to-lay-off-10-of-workforce-following-product-issues/">dumping their staff</a> as capital runways became short, analysts calling for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/03/07/why-a-crypto-analyst-is-adamant-that-bitcoin-wont-fall-under-2000/">sub-$2,000 Bitcoin prices</a>, and mainstream media opining that the blockchain gravy train had crashed entirely.</p>
      <p>Happy anniversary to that… I guess.</p>
      <h3>How’s Bitcoin Celebrating the Anniversary?</h3>
      <p>While this is likely just a coincidence, an extremely important signal flashed bearish during this year’s “anniversary” of the start of the infamous 2018 capitulation. Per <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/15/bitcoin-fell-50-from-6000-in-2018-after-this-key-signal-lit-and-its-flashing-again/">previous reports from NewsBTC</a>, the Hash Ribbons — an indicator tracking the health of Bitcoin’s hash rate — has just seen a bearish crossover. While this may not mean much in and of itself, the bearish crossover of the Ribbons was last seen “just before Bitcoin broke down from $6,000… TL;DR this is a bearish signal.”</p>

      <h3>What Has Changed Since Then?</h3>
      <p>This may leave you wondering, what has changed in the cryptocurrency industry since November 14th, 2018? A lot. A lot a lot.</p>
      <p>We won’t bore you with the details, so here’s a brief summary of key industry events that have taken place since the capitulation of yesteryear:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bakkt finally launched its Bitcoin futures market, and has since seen modest though <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/13/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-print-three-consecutive-days-of-high-volume/">still growing</a> volumes. Since launching its futures contracts, the upstart has revealed intentions to launch options and cash-settled futures, alongside a cryptocurrency payments application that will be usable in Starbucks. Bakkt has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/11/bakkt-opens-bitcoin-custody-to-all-institutions-futures-on-track-for-new-ath/">also launched its custodial platform to all institutions. </a></li>
        <li>Facebook unveiled Libra, marking the first corporate cryptocurrency at any notable scale. Libra has yet to launch due to regulatory restrictions and key partners like PayPal jumping ship.</li>
        <li>China has embraced blockchain technologies after banning Bitcoin trading in 2018.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/?s=Bitcoin+ETF&amp;lang=en">A BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> for the U.S. market remains a quixotic dream.</li>
        <li>President Donald Trump talked about cryptocurrencies, bashing them in a out-of-left-field Twitter thread.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So yeah, a lot has changed. Whether the above is bullish for the cryptocurrency market is up to you, though.</p>
