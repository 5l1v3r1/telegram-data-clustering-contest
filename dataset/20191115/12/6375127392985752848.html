      <h3>MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF) chairman Nur Misuari yesterday called on Mayor Isko Moreno at the Manila City Hall where they discussed the mayor’s previously announced plans of having a cemetery for members of the Muslim community in the city.                            </h3>
      <p>Moreno said that the study on establishing an Islamic Cemetery, which had been undertaken since July, will take into consideration all the traditions that attend every Muslim burial.        </p>
      <p>‘Kung may sementeryo para sa Pilipino at para sa Chinese dito sa Manila, bakit naman hindi tayo magtayo para sa mga kapatid nating Muslim?’ he said.        </p>
      <p>Moreno noted that under the Muslim tradition, burying the dead is a very sacred and important ritual that has to be done within 24 hours.                                </p>
      <p>Since there is only one or two Muslim cemeteries in Metro Manila, these cemeteries are already severely congested, thus raising problems for those who have lost their loved ones.                                                                                      </p>
      <p>With the lack of proper burial grounds, Moreno said the members of the Muslim community are left with no other option but to transport their dead all the way to Mindanao. This, he said, costs at least P10,000 just for the air fare and this is not easily affordable for the regular Muslim-Filipinos.                                     </p>
      <p>Moreno said he is well aware that Manila hosts a huge Muslim community whose members, for years, have been very cooperative and helpful partners of the city government when it comes to community building and doing business.            </p>
      <p>‘Providing them a burial site is our simple way of giving back to them although this is certainly not enough,’ Moreno stressed, adding that about ten percent of the entire Philippine population is comprised of Muslim-Filipinos.</p>
      <p>Misuari thanked Moreno for the gesture of caring for the members of the Muslim community.</p>
