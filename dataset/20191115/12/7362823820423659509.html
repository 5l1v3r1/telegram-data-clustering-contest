      <p>Garrett is likely to face a suspension and a fine over the incident. Pouncey could also see some discipline.</p>
      <p>The third-year Browns star has already been fined more than $50,000 this season for an excessive facemask penalty during a game against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans</a> and a roughing the passer penalty against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a>.</p>
