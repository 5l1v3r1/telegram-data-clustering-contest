        <b>Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger warns that a catastrophic conflict between America and China that will be “worse than world wars” is inevitable unless the two sides sort out their differences.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kissinger made the comments at an event hosted by the National Committee on US China Relations in New York last night.</p>
      <p>“We are in a difficult period now. I am confident the leaders on both sides will realise the future of the world depends on the two sides working out solutions and managing the inevitable difficulties,” said Kissinger.</p>
      <p>A permanent conflict between Washington And Beijing would be unwinnable and lead to “catastrophic outcome,” he added.</p>
      <p>“It’s no longer possible to think that one side can dominate the other…it will be worse than the world wars that ruined European civilisation,” said Kissinger.</p>
      <p>The U.S. and China have been embroiled in a trade war since President Trump began imposing tariffs on thousands of Chinese-made products in a bid to end unfair trading practices.</p>
