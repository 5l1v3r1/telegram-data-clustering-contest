      <p>A three-day exhibition on nature photography was inaugurated by IPS officer Tejdeep Kaur Menon at the State Art Gallery in the city on Friday.</p>
      <p>Organised by Honeycomb, the exhibition brought to light some stunning moments from the nature world.</p>
      <p>“Photography is the reason why I took up conservation work at the Ameenpur Lake and now it is a Biodiversity Heritage site. If I hadn’t seen the photographs, I would not have taken up the work,” said Ms. Kaur Menon at the inaugural ceremony.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who has not spent time in nature is missing something,” Ms. Kaur Menon added.</p>
      <h3>1,000 photos on display</h3>
      <p>“We received around 1,000 photographs from about 200 photographers. A panel of judges shortlisted 100 photographs of 68 photographers which are on display now,” said Celestina, one of the organisers of the show.</p>
      <p>The exhibition ends on November 17.</p>
