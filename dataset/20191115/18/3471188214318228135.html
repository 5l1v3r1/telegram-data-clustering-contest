      <h1>Don’t need a lot of ‘net? Here’s the cheapest NBN plans for November 2019</h1>

      <p>Usually when we’re talking about NBN plans, we’re looking at the biggest data inclusion or the fastest speeds .. it’s not often that we’re talking about the cheapest plans. However, for a lot of people, the NBN isn’t a choice – <a href="https://ausdroid.net/2019/11/15/incredibly-nbn-co-reports-that-the-number-of-awful-12-1-mbps-connections-has-increased/">just look at the comments on the latest ACCC NBN story</a>.</p>
      <p>For some people, the NBN has removed access to their previous ADSL or Cable plans (which may have been quite affordable), meaning that their choices are now quite a bit more limited.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for the price sensitive consumer, the cheapest NBN plans are a bit more expensive than the entry-level ADSL plans which used to start around the $30 mark each month. By comparison, it’s virtually impossible to get the NBN for much less than $50 a month.</p>
      <p>With virtually all these low cost plans, you’re on the slowest connection speed available (25 / 5 Mbps), as most NBN retailers simply won’t sell 12 / 1 connections anymore unless you’re on NBN Satellite. Those plans are a bit cheaper, but frankly the inclusions are terrible unless you simply don’t intend to use the internet for anything beyond checking your email occasionally.</p>
      <p>For everyone else, the NBN fixed-line plans start at $49.95, and for that you do get a surprising amount of data included – up to 200GB from Spintel for example. To get that pricing though, you need to commit for six months. For a contract-free plan, you get half the data.</p>
      <p>Other great offerings at these lower price points include Aussie Broadband, Vodafone and Tangerine, but of those three, Aussie Broadband promises the fastest evening speeds.</p>
      <p>Even with these entry-level plans, you should have a connection fast enough for Netflix or video on demand streaming, downloading music, games and the like, and of course browsing the internet for whatever takes your fancy.</p>
      <p>What’s the best value plan you’ve found?</p>
