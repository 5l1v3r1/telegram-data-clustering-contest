      <p>Donald Trump’s eldest daughter Ivanka Trump was photographed in a silk pyjama-like suit as she was leaving the bar Off The Record in Washington, DC in the company of her husband Jared Kushner, also a senior adviser to the president, where the couple had congratulated Donald Trump Jr. on his book “Triggered” reaching first place on The New York Times bestseller list, the Daily Mail reported.</p>
