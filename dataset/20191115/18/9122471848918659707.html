      <h1>Browns Fans Are Furious With NFL’s Decision To Not Suspend Mason Rudolph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:05:53+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Friday morning, the <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/nfl-announces-suspensions-for-myles-garrett-maurkice-pouncey-larry-ogunjobi">NFL announced suspensions for players involved in a fight</a> during the final seconds of Thursday night’s game between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
      <p>Myles Garrett received an indefinite suspension – for at least the rest of the 2019 season, including playoffs. The suspension comes as a result of Garrett using Mason Rudolph’s helmet as a weapon against the Steelers quarterback.</p>
      <p>The NFL did not suspend Rudolph – although the league left further punishment open.</p>
      <p>Most NFL analysts and former players agreed Garrett deserved a lengthy suspension. However, most also agreed Rudolph deserved to be punished for his part in the scuffle.</p>
      <p>Browns fans were not happy with the league’s decision regarding the lack of punishment for the Steelers quarterback.</p>

      <p>The NFL announced “additional discipline for other players will be forthcoming.” That suggests Rudolph – and other players who left the bench to join in the fracas – are subject to further punishment as well.</p>
      <p>Most likely, the Steelers quarterback could receive a fine for his part in the altercation. Pittsburgh offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey received a three-game suspension for punching and kicking Garrett after he hit Rudolph with the helmet.</p>
      <p>All eyes from the NFL will be on the upcoming game between these two teams on December 1 in Pittsburgh.</p>
