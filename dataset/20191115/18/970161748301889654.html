      <p>Ex-I’m A Celebrity campmate Scarlett Moffat has revealed her predictions for the eventual top three contestants as the show prepares for its grand return this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> are just some of the famous faces heading to Australia to camp out for the ITV show.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the show, the former Queen of the Jungle took to Instagram to share her top tips for who will be the most successful participants.</p>
      <p>And she’s tipped Capital FM DJ Roman, ex-footballer <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> and Eastenders actress Jacqueline Jossa to go all the way.</p>
      <p>The potential line-up for the finalists of the show may surprise some fans, as Scarlett hasn’t included Girls Aloud’s Nadine, Good Morning Britain anchor Kate Garraway or the show’s biggest coup this year, reality TV icon Caitlyn.</p>

      <p>More than just a bookie, however, Scarlett also made sure to include some pointers for this year’s contestants.</p>
      <p>And we would listen to her advice – she did go on to win the whole show, after all.</p>

      <p>Apparently, it’s better to volunteer to clear out the Dunny on day four, known as constipation day (lovely) and to choose a hammock instead of a bed since it’s more comfortable.</p>
      <p>This will also be the first time in three years the Gogglebox star won’t be flying Down Under herself to partake in all the fun.</p>
      <p>Instead, actress Emily Atack has replaced her as the host of spin-off show Extra Camp alongside comedian Joel Dommett and Emmerdale’s Adam Thomas.</p>
      <p>Ahead of its launch this Sunday, everyone is preparing themselves for the literal trials and tribulations the celebrities will be put through during their tenure in the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>And we could be in for actual landmark television, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebritys-myles-stephenson-to-grill-caitlin-jenner-over-oj-simpson-murder-trial-11162233/">Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson is apparently ready to grill Jenner over the OJ Simpson murder trial</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time of the trial, the athlete was of course married to Kris Jenner, whose ex-husband Robert Kardashian was a lawyer on OJ’s defence team.</p>
