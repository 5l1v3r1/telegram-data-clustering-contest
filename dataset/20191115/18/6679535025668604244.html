      <p>Forest Department officials captured a 16-foot-long king cobra at Narasipuram, near Thondamuthur, here on Thursday and released it into the forests.</p>
      <p>Forest Department sources said the king cobra was found in a private farm at Narasipuram on Thursday. Upon sighting the snake, the farm owners alerted snake catchers and the Forest Department.</p>
      <p>The snake was caught by a snake catcher named Santhosh Kumar, sources said. With the help of officials from Booluvampatti Forest Range, the snake was released in the forests near Vaidehi Falls on Thursday.</p>
      <p>With the binomial name <i>Ophiophagus hannah</i>, king cobra is the world's longest venomous snake with its average length ranging from 10 to 13 feet. A senior official from the Forest Department said that though king cobras are present widely across the Western Ghats, it rarely ventures out of dense forests.</p>
