      <p>The federal government is set to build a new Sea Port, estimated to cost $800 million in Pessu area of Warri in Delta state.</p>
      <p>Minister of Transportation, Rt Hon Rotimi Amaechi disclosed this Thursday, at the Petroleum Training Institute Conference Centre, in Uvwie council area of Delta state.</p>
      <p>Amaechi who was in company of the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr Festus Keyamo (SAN) and Director-General, National Directorate of Employment, Dr. Nasiru Ladan Argungu tasked youths of the area to support the forthcoming project.</p>
      <p>The trio were in the state to present starter packs, micro enterprise enhancement loans and resettlement packages to 1,700 women and youths under the National Directorate of Employment empowerment programme.</p>
      <p>While urging youths to ensure the project goes on smoothly when it takes off Amaechi revealed further that a similar Sea Port will be built in Bonny, Bonny local government area of Rivers state.</p>

      <p>“We are building a brand new Sea Port in Pessu. It will cost 800 million dollars. When you stop them from working you are losing such a huge investment where the entire community can be contractors, some can supply sand.</p>
      <p>“There is also the Bonny sea Port that is coming. The best thing to do is allow the development. Imagine the companies that have left Warri, let the Sea Port project go on smoothly,” the minister appealed.</p>
      <p>On his part, the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr. Keyamo reassured of the federal government’s commitment to lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty.</p>
      <p>He added that with what is being given in this early stage of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, Deltans should expect more, in terms of empowerment, to come in the next few years.</p>
      <p>Some items given to the beneficiaries drawn from the 25 LGAs in the state include sewing machines, knitting machines, welding machines and cash sums.</p>
