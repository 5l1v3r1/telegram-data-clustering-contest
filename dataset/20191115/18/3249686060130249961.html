      <p>Netizens noticed that <b>G-Dragon</b> and<b> T.O.P</b> have moved over to encrypted messaging app Telegram instead of the widely used Korean messaging app Kakaotalk. </p>
      <p>Sharp-eyed netizens noticed that the two were now talking on Telegram after T.O.P uploaded a chat from G-Dragon on Instagram. The chat talks about T.O.P receiving a painting that G-Dragon drew. T.O.P jokes that the painting isn't his style and he is going to sell it on a secondhand online shop.</p>

      <p>Given the recent '<b>Burning Sun</b>' scandal and how Kakaotalk messages were how many of the scandals were uncovered, netizens think that using Telegram will be a safer option because it offers encryption and secret chats.</p>
