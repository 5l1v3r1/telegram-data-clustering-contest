      <p>Disney+'s <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/loki-tv/">Loki</a> series may be getting a little bigger.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/loki-sophia-di-martino-tom-hiddleston-marvel-1203406777/">Variety</a>, Sophia Di Martino is in talks with Marvel Studios to join <i>Loki</i>. It's unknown at this time who Di Martino would play if she does indeed sign on for the project. Marvel did not comment on the potential casting, so at this time it's possible negotiations will breakdown and the actor will not appear in <i>Loki</i>.</p>

      <p>Little is known about <i>Loki </i>at this time. However, the Disney+ series will tie into <i>Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness</i>, much like <i>WandaVision</i>. The <a href="https://www.cbr.com/loki-tv-time-travel-component/">show will seemingly involve</a> time travel and follow the 2012 version of Loki, who escaped with the Tesseract during <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, as he alters historical events.</p>
      <p><i>Loki</i>, starring Tom Hiddleston, is set to hit Disney+ sometime in Spring 2021. <i>Rick &amp; Morty</i> writer Michael Waldron will write the series and be billed as creator, with <i>Sex Education</i>'s Kate Herron directing all the episodes.</p>
