      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett will miss the remainder of the NFL season after being suspended indefinitely for his attack on Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph.</p>
      <p>The two players were involved in a scuffle with just seconds remaining of the Browns’ 21-7 victory over their AFC North rivals at the FirstEnergy Stadium on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>During the melee, Garrett managed to rip the helmet off of Rudolph before using it “as a weapon”, according to the NFL, by swinging it at him and striking him on his head.</p>

      <p>A mass brawl between players from both sides then ensued, with Garrett joined by defensive tackle team-mate Larry Ogunjobi and Pittsburgh centre Maurkice Pouncey in being ejected from the game.</p>
      <p>Pouncey, who threw punches at Garrett and attempted to kick him in the head while he was on the ground, has received a three-game ban.</p>
      <p>A NFL statement read: “The Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns organisations have each been fined $250,000 (£193,668) and three players – Cleveland’s Myles Garrett and Larry Ogunjobi, and Pittsburgh’s Maurkice Pouncey – have been suspended without pay for their actions in Thursday night’s game.</p>

      <p>“Garrett has been suspended without pay indefinitely – at a minimum for the remainder of the regular season and post-season – and must meet with the commissioner’s office prior to a decision on his reinstatement.  He was also fined an additional amount.</p>
      <p>“Garrett violated unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct rules, as well as fighting, removing the helmet of an opponent and using the helmet as a weapon.</p>
      <p>“Pouncey has been suspended without pay for three games and fined an additional amount for fighting, including punching and kicking an opponent.</p>
      <p>“Ogunjobi has been suspended without pay for one game and fined an additional amount for unnecessary roughness, specifically for shoving an opposing player to the ground during an altercation.”</p>

      <p>The NFL has confirmed “additional discipline” will be meted out to other players for their part in the altercation, including those “that left the bench to enter the fight area”.</p>
      <p>Garrett, Pouncey and Ogunjobi have three business days to appeal.</p>
      <p>After the game, Garrett stated to NFL.com that he “made a mistake, I lost my cool and I regret it”.</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s going to come back to hurt our team. I appreciate my team having my back but it should’ve never gotten to that point. It’s on me.</p>
      <p>“It was embarrassing. What I did was foolish and I shouldn’t allow myself to slip like that. It was out of character, but it was a situation like that, it is an emotional game, and I allowed myself to follow through those emotions.”</p>
      <p>The Browns and Steelers meet again at Pittsburgh’s Heinz Field on December 1.</p>
