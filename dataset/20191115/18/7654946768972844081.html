      <h1>Prehistoric fossils found beneath Hollywood Academy Museum</h1>

      <p>Beneath Hollywood’s new Academy Museum, researchers have made a surprising discovery: the dead carpet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/movie-academy-museum-fossils-la-brea-tar-pits-1202784851/">Deadline reports</a> that during construction on the new facility — which will house movie memorabilia, a 1,000-seat theater and more — paleontologists found a trove of Ice Age fossils.</p>
      <p>“You may think that Yellowstone is scary today, but this place would have been way scarier than that,” Dr. Regan Dunn, assistant curator of the La Brea Tar Pits, told the outlet of Los Angeles 40,000 years ago.</p>
      <p>Back then, she said, the land was colder and wetter, and overrun with “mean cats” (“much bigger” than mountain lions), bison, mammoths and “an awful lot of dire wolves.”</p>
      <p>Although no complete skeletons have been found, scientists recovered fragments of long-extinct animals, such as the Harlan giant ground sloth, Pacific Mastodon, saber-toothed cat and dwarf pronghorn antelope.</p>
      <p>“In this area, you always have the possibility of running into fossils and our past inhabitants here,” Dunn said. “It’s just so cool to think about the greater Miracle Mile back so many thousands of years ago and what it looked like compared to what it looks like now.”</p>
      <p>The museum has not yet set an opening date.</p>
