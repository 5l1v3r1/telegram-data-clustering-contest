      <h1>Michigan vs. Michigan State: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:21:24+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>FOX’s “Big Noon Saturday” this weekend features a major Big Ten rivalry with two programs moving in very different directions. Michigan is playing its best football of the season, while Michigan State has sputtered at the middle of the season.</p>
      <p>The Spartans started the season 4-1, and on Sept. 28, picked up what now looks like a very solid 40-31 win over Indiana.</p>
      <p>Mark Dantonio’s team hasn’t won a game since. Michigan State is now 4-5, with four straight losses to Ohio State, Wisconsin, Penn State, and last weekend, Illinois.</p>
      <p>Obviously, that stretch is about as tough a three-game set as you’ll find in college football. The Illinois game drives home the struggles that the Spartans have had. Michigan State surrendered 27 fourth quarter points, <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/michigan-state/michigan-state-fans-not-happy-with-mark-dantonios-comment-after-loss">blowing a giant lead to lose 37-34</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile after a September that more-or-less eliminated Michigan from Big Ten title hopes, the Wolverines are now on a nice run.</p>
      <p>In the last two games, Michigan has blasted a ranked Notre Dame team, and handled overmatched Maryland. The season hasn’t met expectations, but Jim Harbaugh and his staff have figured some stuff out.</p>

      <p>Jim Harbaugh has received plenty of criticism for his struggles in big games and against rivals, but he has a chance to score a second on the year tomorrow afternoon. Of course, Michigan State being under-.500 doesn’t have quite the same impact as blowing out a ranked Notre Dame team, or finally beating Ohio State would be.</p>
      <p>Michigan won this game last season, 21-7. Overall, the Wolverines have a big edge in the all-time series, which dates back to 1898, 70-36-5. Things are much closer in the Big Ten era, which dates back to 1950, with Michigan being up 37-30-2.</p>
      <p>MSU has captured eight of 11 games since Lloyd Carr stepped down at Michigan after the 2007 season.</p>
