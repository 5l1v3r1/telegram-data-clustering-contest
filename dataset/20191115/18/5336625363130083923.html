      <p>A team of ducks crossing the road in Gisborne, New Zealand were saved when Tesla Autopilot sensed the fowl in the road and swerved at the last minute, narrowly avoiding them.</p>
      <p>According to the video's description, the driver of the Tesla Model 3 didn't notice the ducks because of a shadow on the road. But Autopilot did, and stepped in just in time, braking and veering into the adjacent empty lane.</p>
      <p>"If it wasn't for the Autopilot function, I think the ducks would not have survived," the driver wrote. </p>
      <p>The ducks cut it close, and we definitely gasped at the near miss. Unfortunately, Autopilot <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/05/30/tesla-autopilot-stationary-crashes/">does not perform seamlessly</a> every time, and advancing car tech <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/04/12/self-driving-cars-safety-autonomous/">continues to be a topic</a> of both interest and skepticism. But we're happy the ducks made it out unscathed. </p>
