      <h1>SAT pulls up Sebi for 'shabby' handling of complaints from investor</h1>
      <h2>It said that disposal of the complaints by the markets regulator was merely an eyewash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:52:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author">Shrimi Choudhury</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/securities-and-appellate-tribunal">Securities and Appellate Tribunal </a>(SAT) has hauled up the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for giving computer-generated response to investor complaints filed on its online platform Scores and for disposing of the matter without settling the case.</p>
      <p>“We find the approach adopted by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>to be a strange one. Such computer-generated disposal of a serious complaint speaks volumes on the conduct in treating the minority shareholders in this shabby manner,” the tribunal said while delivering a judgment on a matter related to an investor complaint.</p>
      <p>It said that disposal of the complaints by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>regulator was merely an eyewash.</p>
      <p>Scores is an online platform designed to help <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/investors">investors </a>lodge their complaints pertaining to the securities market. All complaints received by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>against listed companies and market intermediaries are dealt with through this mechanism.</p>
      <p>The tribunal observed that complaints were filed six years ago against 16 listed entities, including the registered intermediaries, but were disposed of by the regulator without settling the case.</p>
      <p>“It seems that the respondents have lost sight of the mandate provided to them under Section 11 of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>Act which mandates it to safeguard the interest of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/investors">investors.</a> Disposal of the complaint in this manner in the instant case indicates non-application of mind and non-consideration of the interest of the investors,” SAT said in an order.</p>
      <p>“We have no hesitation in stating that the Sebi as a regulator in the instant case has not performed its duties and has kept the complaint pending for more than six years which speaks volumes by itself.”</p>
      <p>It added the “tribunal fails to fathom as to why the complaint could not have been decided unless Sebi officials had a vested interest in not deciding the matter”.</p>
      <p>The matter pertains to a complaint filed in 2013 by minority public shareholders of three companies — Bharat Nidhi (BNL), PNB Finance and Camac Commercial — for non-disclosure of promoter shareholding of BNL and also the violation of minimum public shareholding requirement by BNL.</p>
      <p>BNL, PNBF and Camac hold 24.41 per cent, 9.29 per cent and 13.3 per cent shares, respectively, in Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co (BCCL). The contention of the complainant was that the three companies are owned and controlled by Vineet Jain, Samir Jain and their family members, who are the managing directors of BCCL.</p>
      <p>Replying to this, Sebi said the information submitted by the appellants would be analysed and investigation would be made in a holistic manner but, on the other hand, it would neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation conducted by them.</p>
      <p>Later, the regulator disposed of the case and said the information provided by the complainants would be taken as market intelligence and would also be treated as confidential.</p>
      <p>SAT questioned the response and asked why would the complaint be treated as market intelligence or confidential.</p>
      <p>The tribunal on Thursday set aside the Sebi order and allowed the appeal by the complainants. It also directed the regulator to “consider and decide the matter by a reasoned and speaking order within six weeks from the date of presentation along with the appellate order”.</p>
