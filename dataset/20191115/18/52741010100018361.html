      <p>EDMONTON — An environmental group says Alberta's decision to allow a ski hill in a provincial park to sell water it's not using and have it trucked away sets a bad precedent.</p>
      <p>Late last month, the province approved a request from Fortress Mountain ski resort in Spray Valley Provincial Park to allow it to sell 50,000 cubic metres of water a year.</p>
      <p>The resort's original licence was for water to be used on site and the change doesn't increase the hill's total water allowance.</p>
      <p>But Carolyn Campbell of the Alberta Wilderness Association says companies shouldn't be allowed to sell water from protected areas for purposes other than what was originally intended.</p>
      <p>She says that could open the door to other companies doing the same thing.</p>
      <p>Campbell says that would eventually reduce the province's ability to manage water use in the Bow Valley and that's a risky move in a changing climate.</p>
      <p>Spray Valley Provincial Park is in the eastern Rockies in an area referred to as Kananaskis Country.</p>
