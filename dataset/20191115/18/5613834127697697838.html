      <h1>Ryan Murphy Teases Star-Studded “American Horror Story” Season 10; Could Be Final Season on FX?</h1>

      <p>With the ninth season wrapped up, it’s time to look ahead to the future of “<b>American Horror Story</b>,” and a tenth season has indeed been contracted by FX and will likely arrive late next year. It’ll be a while before we know much of anything about season ten – including the theme – but in a new chat with <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/american-horror-story-season-10-spoilers-ryan-murphy-ahs-1984-interview-season-finale-ratched-hollywood-streaming-dates-1202785704/">Deadline</a>, <b>Ryan Murphy</b> did let some early teaser details slip.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Murphy also noted that season ten *could* be the show’s last.</p>
      <blockquote>“<i>We’re working on an idea for season 10 that I think people will love because it’s about reuniting fan-favorite actors to come back — because it might be our last season</i>,” Murphy told the site.</blockquote>
      <p>He explained, “<i><b>It’s the last season we have contracted.</b> So, I’ve been quietly reaching out to various people. Some people I haven’t reached out to yet because I was like ‘Do I have a role for them?’ So far, everybody I reached out to said ‘Yes’, so that’s been great</i>.”</p>
      <p>So who’s coming back? Murphy says it’s “<i>too soon to tell</i>.” He does add, however, that “<i><b>the people who helped build this show into what it is, who believed in it from the beginning, have been contacted and are interested.</b> So if you look at the iconography of the first three seasons, you can figure who I’ve gone to and who might be coming back</i>.”</p>
      <p>In regards to season ten possibly being the show’s last, Murphy makes it clear that he’s got a backup plan in the event that FX doesn’t order up additional seasons: Netflix.</p>
      <p>“<i>We’re in the middle of negotiations about beyond season 10. We have had conversations about the show going 20 seasons. <b>If [FX’s John Landgraf] for some reason said, ‘We don’t want to make this anymore’, would I call up Netflix? Yes</b></i>,” Murphy explains. “<i>But he’s only ever expressed love and enthusiasm and he wants to keep it going. I have every good intention of it staying there and I think he does too. We’re talking about it. We’re trying to figure it out</i>.”</p>
