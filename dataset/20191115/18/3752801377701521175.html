      <p>Two Coligny men convicted of murdering teenager Matlhomola Moshoeu were granted R20 000 bail each by the North West High Court in Mmabatho on Friday.</p>
      <p>Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte were found guilty of murder, kidnapping, intimidation, theft and pointing a firearm after Moshoeu was killed in April 2017.</p>
      <p>The pair's legal team - led by advocate Barry Roux SC - was granted leave to appeal their conviction directly to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein.</p>
      <p>Roux's legal bill is being financed by lobby group AfriForum.</p>
      <p>In a statement released by AfriForum on Friday, its CEO, Kallie Kriel, was quoted as saying: "We know the men are innocent and they do not deserve to be in prison for a day longer. They have been in detention for 13 months and it is 13 months too long."</p>
      <p>Kriel said AfriForum would continue to pay the men's legal costs for the appeal process.</p>
      <p>Moshoeu was thrown from a moving vehicle after being accused of <a href="https://stealingsunflowers.news24.com/">stealing sunflowers</a>. Both men claimed he had jumped from the vehicle while they were taking him to the police station.</p>
      <p>His death was met with anger in Coligny, with many saying racism was the determining factor for the men's actions.</p>
      <p>Roux argued during the bail application last week that they should be released on bail as two SCA had indicated there was a reasonable chance the court could come to a different finding.</p>
      <p>North West High Court Judge Ronnie Hendricks said the murder was not planned or premeditated, but a case of <i>dolus eventualis</i> - which means they should have expected something bad to happen as a result of their actions.</p>
      <p>Doorewaard was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for murder, three for kidnapping, two for intimidation, one for theft, and two for pointing a firearm. He will effectively serve 18 years.</p>
      <p>Schutte was handed 20 years for murder, three for kidnapping, two for intimidation, a year for theft, and two for pointing a firearm. He will effectively serve 23 years. </p>
      <p>Comment from the National Prosecuting Authority in the North West was not immediately available, but will be added once received.</p>
