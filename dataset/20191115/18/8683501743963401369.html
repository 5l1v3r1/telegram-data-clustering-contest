      <p>Like so many parents, actress Kristen Bell has children eagerly awaiting the release of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2484733/frozen-ii-review-a-dull-confusing-story-not-saved-by-a-phenomenal-soundtrack"><i>Frozen II</i></a>. But unlike other parents that have had mental breaks upon hearing “Let it Go” for the 10,000th time, Kristen Bell is actually in Disney’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481434/frozen-iis-director-explains-what-took-the-sequel-so-long">long-awaited animated sequel</a>, where she voices Anna. So her kids didn’t have to wait to find out what happens in Arendelle, Kristen Bell was able to tell them ahead of time, which of course she did. And after Kristen Bell spoiled <i>Frozen II</i>, she panicked, as she recalled:</p>
      <blockquote>I came home and I was like, 'Okay, here's what happens.' After I read the script I told them everything, and they were excited. And then it occurred to me that I was in breach of my contract. And I'm thankful now that it's out, that I can no longer get sued by Disney. I said to [my kids], 'It's very important that you don't tell anyone at school.'</blockquote>
      <p>Kristen Bell was so excited upon reading the script for <i>Frozen II</i>, that she couldn’t help herself but to come home and let her two young daughters know about it. By the sound of it they were eager to hear about the sequel and were quite excited by what she told them, which was everything. But in her desire to be <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481258/frozen-ii-elsas-mother-has-an-even-bigger-role-than-we-thought">the cool mom</a> she made something of a tactical error and upon that realization she panicked.</p>
      <p>That’s because when you’re in a Disney movie, you don’t just get to tell everyone what happens in it all willy-nilly, especially for a movie as big as <i>Frozen II</i>. There are contracts and NDAs, legally binding documents that I imagine say something along the lines of ‘snitches get stitches,’ but in official legal parlance of course.</p>
      <p>So Kristen Bell rightly panicked that she was in breach of her contract by spoiling <i>Frozen II</i> and putting what happens in the huge sequel out into the world. At that point, she had already broken her contract and opened herself up to legal action from Mickey Mouse’s mighty studio.</p>
      <p>It then became about containment and damage control. As the actress told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0RjnJf1Mmk">SiriusXM</a>, she had to tell her kids how important it was that they keep the <i>Frozen II</i> spoilers a secret. It was a desperate move, because as a species children are not known for their secret-keeping abilities, but it was her only play. Fortunately, her young children were able to keep the secret and if they didn’t, whoever they told about <i>Frozen II</i> on the playground didn’t have a Reddit account.</p>
      <p><i>Frozen</i> fans have been waiting years for the sequel to arrive, so the stakes are certainly high. And for those need a refresher on the original, they can now stream <i>Frozen</i> on Disney+. You can <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/410947/705874/9358">use this link for a free 7-day trial</a>.</p>
      <p>So Kristen Bell can rest easy now that <i>Frozen II</i> is about to be released and people <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484771/frozen-ii-reviews-are-in-heres-what-the-critics-are-saying">have already seen it</a>. Her children won’t be resting easy though because in addition to <i>Frozen II</i> spoilers, Kristen Bell warned them about a certain biological destiny they will face if they spoil the sequel's contents.</p>
      <blockquote>I tell them all the time. I tell them two things. I say, number one, all your teeth are gonna fall out. Which is the best thing you can say to a kid.</blockquote>
      <p>You know how Anna doesn’t want Kristoff to tell Olaf about what happens to frozen things in summer in the first <i>Frozen</i>? Yeah, clearly that’s not who <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484655/the-frozen-ii-plotline-kristen-bell-is-proudest-of-may-surprise-you">Kristen Bell</a> is in real life. As if humans aren’t innately coded to have teeth-falling-out dreams, her poor daughters are now traumatized with this knowledge. That tooth fairy better deliver some seriously good presents to them.</p>
      <p><i>Frozen II</i> arrives in theaters <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484116/even-more-proof-that-frozen-ii-is-going-to-be-a-gargantuan-hit">to dominate the box office</a> on November 22.
