      <p><b>MEXICO CITY — </b>The bodies of five members of a family have been found in the Mexican Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, and four men have been arrested in the killings.</p>
      <p>The family members ranged in age from 11 to 70. No motive was given for the slayings, which are believed to be gang-related.</p>
      <p>The prosecutors’ office in the southern state of Guerrero said Friday the family disappeared a month ago. Their bodies were found Friday.</p>
      <p>The office said the four suspects belonged to a local gang known as “The Virus.” Two suspects who died in a shootout with marines in October were also members of the gang and probably also participated in the kidnap-killing of the family.</p>
      <p>The once-glittering resort has been plagued by drug-gang violence for about the last 15 years.</p>
