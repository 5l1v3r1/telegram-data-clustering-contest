      <h3>Boost's plans</h3>
      <p>Boost Mobile plans start at just $35 per month for 3GB of data and unlimited calling and texting. This can be upgraded to unlimited data with more speed and features going up. Unlimited starts at $50 per month, but with two lines it's only $80 or $40 per line. With Boost, one of the best ways to save is to bring more lines.</p>

      <p>HD video streaming can be added to the plans for $10 per month, though this won't be worth it to many people since using Wi-Fi will also result in HD videos.</p>
      <p>Boost also offers device insurance to give you replacement options if your device is damaged, lost, or stolen. There would be a deductible of $20, $50, $100, or $150 depending on the device in question.</p>
      <h3>International service</h3>
      <p>Boost Mobile has several plans for getting you connected around the world. A Todo Mexico plan helps people stay connected in Mexico with unlimited calls and texts to and from Mexico, as well as 8GB of data when roaming in Mexico. The plan also allows for unlimted calls and texts in Canada. Boost Mobile is one of the strongest MVNOs around when it comes to international service.</p>

      <h3>The Sprint network</h3>
      <p>To be honest, the Sprint network doesn't have the best reputation in the world. The good news is that Sprint didn't take this lying down and has been consistently investing in its 4G LTE network leading to improved speeds and consistecy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/Fastest-Mobile-Networks">PCMag.com's</a> 2019 results for the fastest mobile networks show that even though Sprint isn't the top scorer, it is significantly faster than last year. This is good news for people already on Sprint's network as well as those looking to buy in.</p>
      <p>It's important to remeber that Sprint does have roaming agreements to fill in its LTE coverage that Boost Mobile customers won't have access to. Be sure to check the coverage map even if you already have good service on Sprint.</p>

      <p>Boost Mobile is focused more on the low to mid-range phones with one of the fastest phones available being the Samsung Galaxy S10e. This is by no means a bad thing since there are more great mid-range phones than ever, but you should be sure to check the reviews before you buy a phone at any price.</p>
      <p>If you were coming with the hopes of getting a high-end on a cheap data plan, you'll need to bring your own. Just be sure it's compatible before you make the purchase.</p>
      <p>All phones will need to be compatible with the Sprint CDMA and LTE network to work properly. That doesn't necessarily that all Sprint phones will be able to be transferred to Boost Mobile, so be sure to double check if you're a Sprint customer thinking about switching.</p>

      <h3>The prepaid advantage</h3>
      <p>Even if you've checked the coverage maps, it's still possible that you're not satisfied with service on Boost Mobile. Thanks to being a prepaid provider, you aren't locked into a contract and are free to try out more options. Just be sure to transfer your phone number before you let your contract run out or you could lose it.</p>
      <p>If you're not happy with Boost Mobile for one reason or another, there are plenty of alternative carriers to choose from.</p>
