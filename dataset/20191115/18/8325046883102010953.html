      <p>“Pokémon Sword” and “Pokémon Shield” were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-pokemon-games-nintendo-switch-sword-shield-2019-2">released on the Nintendo Switch on November 15,</a> introducing fans to the eighth generation of Pokémon.</p>
      <p>Announced on the 23rd anniversary of the franchise, “Pokémon Shield” and “Pokémon Sword” will debut dozens of new Pokémon living in a never-before-seen part of the Pokémon world.</p>
      <p>Like the original Pokémon titles, “Sword” and “Shield” are role-playing games. Players will adventure through the brand-new Galar region, capturing Pokémon and battling other trainers on their way to becoming the Pokémon champion.</p>
      <p>“Pokémon Sword” and “Pokémon Shield” are two versions of the same game, a long-standing tradition in the Pokémon series. Players will encounter different Pokémon depending on which version they pick, and will have to trade for Pokémon from the opposite version. Still, both games share the same story and gameplay experience.</p>
      <p>Though “Pokémon Sword and Shield” will have lots of new Pokémon, not all of the franchise’s 800-plus creatures will appear in the game. Past Pokémon games made room for the whole roster, but the developers of “Sword and Shield” chose to focus on 400 Pokémon and spend the rest of their resources improving the game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here’s what you can expect from “Pokémon Sword” and “Pokémon Shield” so far:</b>
