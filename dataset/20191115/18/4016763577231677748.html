      <p>The Promotion</p>
      <p>She spoke about dropping <a href="https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-liar-lyrics">“Liar”</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-shameless-lyrics">“Shameless.”</a> at once in an interview with the <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCh2rBNZNNE">Zach Sang Show</a></i>. “I think it’s too much pressure when I haven’t released an album in a year and a half to just put out one song,” the singer said. “That’s a bit much for me. I don’t like it… I’m not really like a drop one single kinda gal. I feel like I want to put out more music, more visuals, more stuff because I feel like then it makes you appreciate the one song more because you have context for it.”</p>
      <p>The Recording Process</p>
      <p>Cabello <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4zhUnZH0xR/">posted</a> about how the album is a reflection of her experience with falling in love. “I just wanted this album to sound like what falling in love feels like, pretty impossible thing to do but I can say I gave it all I had,” she wrote. “I’ve never lived as much life as I did writing this album. It was messy, and beautiful, unforgettable and at times so painful I wish I could forget, it was excruciatingly consuming and impossible not to get lost in.”</p>
      <p>She elaborated on how the album captures her “essence” at this moment. “There was a time when I was listening to these songs that I had to turn the album off,” she told <i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a28872167/camila-cabello-interview-october-2019-elle-cover/">Elle</a></i>. “I had to let go emotionally—I sat there and cried so much. I feel an undeniable truth that the album has captured the essence of me at this point in my life. I always think, “Could I be more honest? Could I be more open?” I feel like I’ve done that even better than on my first album.”</p>

      <p>According to an <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/romance/1487577356">Apple Music preview</a>, the LP contains 14 tracks. She’s already dropped six songs: <a href="https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-shameless-lyrics">“Shameless,”</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Shawn-mendes-and-camila-cabello-senorita-lyrics">“Señorita,”</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-liar-lyrics">“Liar,”</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-easy-lyrics">“Easy,”</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-cry-for-me-lyrics">“Cry for Me,”</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-living-proof-lyrics">“Living Proof.”</a></p>
