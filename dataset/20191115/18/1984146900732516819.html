      <p>Rail unions have slammed Tyne and Wear Metro bosses after train drivers voted to take industrial action on the network from December.</p>
      <p>It was announced on Thursday that Metro drivers had rejected a 15% pay rise that would bring their salaries up to an estimated £46,000 by 2022, an offer than operator Nexus said was “unprecedented”.</p>
      <p>It has now been confirmed that members of the RMT and Aslef unions are expected to impose a ban on overtime and rest day working from December 1 until further notice.</p>
      <p>While the action is short of a full strike that would shut down the network, it is understood that the move will mean cancelled services, longer waits, and busier trains for passengers in the run up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>RMT general secretary Mick Cash called criticism of drivers by Nexus chiefs “ludicrous”.</p>
      <p>He said: “RMT has received a report from our regional organiser recommending we implement the overwhelming ballot result at Nexus and taking the union into a formal programme of industrial action.</p>
      <p>"That report will be considered by RMT’s executive.</p>
      <p>“It is wholly down to the company that drivers pay and conditions have been allowed to stagnate and slip way behind the industry norm, creating a staffing crisis as drivers head for other train operators where they can get a better deal.</p>

      <p>“It is ludicrous for the company to ignore the facts and to run to the media with a megaphone in hand to attack their remaining staff and the unions who are simply looking for a rational settlement that recognises the historic failure to keep pace.”</p>
      <p>It was revealed recently that Metro bosses have already <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/nexus-cash-crisis-services-cut-17134453">spent £500,000 on overtime pay</a> this year because of a shortage of train drivers.</p>
      <p>It is expected that a driver ban on overtime working will mean cancellations of rush hour trains, when passenger demand is at its highest.</p>
      <p>A Nexus spokesperson said: “We need to assess the full the impact of the overtime ban on Metro and we will ensure that passengers are kept fully informed about this well in advance.</p>
      <p>“We continue to urge the unions to get around the table with us to agree the pay deal of 15% that we have offered so that we can get on with delivering Metro services to the tens of the thousands of people who rely on Metro to get around in the run up to the busy festive period.”</p>
      <p>Drivers have also voted to withdraw from voluntary coaching roles in Metro’s driver training programme from December 1.</p>
      <p>An Aslef spokesman said: "We are disappointed that the company, which had indicated it would do its best to match drivers' salaries offered elsewhere on the rail network, and consequently stop the drain of drivers from Tyne &amp; Wear Metro, has decided, at the last moment, to come up short.</p>
      <p>"The company needs to get its act together, deliver on promises it made in private, and make sure it trains and retains the right number of drivers it needs to run the service it has promised passengers it will deliver.</p>
      <p>"The company is haemorrhaging staff and only the company can put that right."</p>
