      <p>Water stagnation and flooding during rainy season at the underpass at Chavadipalayam Pudur along Karur Bypass Road has become a perennial problem for villagers, who wanted a permanent solution to put an end to the issue.</p>
      <p>People in 10 villages, including students and workers, use the underpass to reach Karur Bypass Road and proceed to their destinations.</p>
      <p>Also, the road leads to Modakurichi and connects with the Muthur Main Road. Seepage from Lower Bhavani Project (LBP) canal and water from the agricultural fields stagnates at the underpass from August to January causing inconvenience to the people.</p>
      <p>During rainy season, water stagnates in large quantities in the area making it difficult for vehicles to pass through.</p>
      <p>“Waterways and a small channel here are not maintained properly and bushes prevent movement of water,” said Pavathal of the area. She said that three weeks ago, the underpass was flooded and vehicle users were forced to take additional distance to reach Karur Road.</p>
      <p>A few people in the area said that the natural route of the water was blocked and water could not reach the water bodies in the area.</p>
      <h3>Students hit</h3>
      <p>“Bushes should be cleared and the canal should be deepened and widened to carry more water,” said a farmer Manikandan. He said that they are facing the issue for many years now and students face more hardship as their path is blocked due to flooding.</p>
