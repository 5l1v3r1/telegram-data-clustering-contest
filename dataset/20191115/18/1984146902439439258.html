      <p>A much loved mum of three who went to the doctor's with a cough has died just six weeks after being diagnosed with lung cancer.</p>
      <p>Jane Brogan passed away suddenly at home on the day doctors were due to decide whether or not to continue treating her for the disease.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old's world was shattered when what she thought was a chest infection turned out to be stage four lung cancer.</p>
      <p>Jane, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bedlington">Bedlington</a>, had been suffering from a bad cough for about six weeks.</p>
      <p>After attending hospital with what she thought was a minor ailment, she was horrified to be told she had months to live.</p>
      <p>The single mum had started chemotherapy and was planning a final Christmas with her three children, Molly, 14, Elena, seven and Thomas, five, when she contracted pneumonia.</p>
      <p>Doctors had said they wouldn’t be able to continue the cancer treatment while she had an infection, but told her that without it she wouldn’t live to see Christmas.</p>
      <p>But on the day she was due to learn her fate, Jane died at her home in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> .</p>
      <p>“We’re devastated. We thought we’d get one last Christmas,” said Jane’s sister Julie.</p>

      <p>“We’d even planned to move it forward after what the doctors said.</p>
      <p>"She had texted me the night before saying she wasn’t feeling great and had been coughing a lot so was trying to get some sleep.</p>
      <p>"From diagnosis to her passing away has only been six weeks.</p>
      <p>"It’s really difficult- everyone’s struggling with it.</p>
      <p>"Jane had been pretty upbeat through the whole lot, I don’t know how she’s been the way she’s been.</p>
      <p>"She’d started buying the children Christmas presents."</p>
      <p>Jane’s family and friends are continuing to fundraise to take her three children to Florida in May, with a charity evening at Bedlington Terriers FC planned for December 14.</p>
      <p>A statement from her family said: “Jane was a much loved mam, daughter, sister, auntie and great auntie. She loved her friends, music, animals and, more recently, cakes.</p>
      <p>"She was most devastated about leaving her children behind and missing out on them growing up, and key milestones in their lives.“</p>
