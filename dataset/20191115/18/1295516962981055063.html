      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/joker-film/">Joker</a> continues to make history, as the Joaquin Phoenix-starred DC character study has earned $1 billion at the global box office -- making it the very first R-rated film to do so.</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/15/joker-box-office-1-billion-worldwide/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Warner Bros. has officially confirmed <i>Joker</i> will have crossed the coveted box office milestone as of today, Friday, Nov. 15. The Clown Prince of Crime's first live-action solo film joins the $1 billion club as it enters its seventh weekend, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/15/box-office-joker-tops-1-billion/#31c5da6649dc">Forbes</a> having reported a $998 worldwide gross leading into today.</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> initially <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-impressive-international-weekend-opening/">exceeded expectations</a> with a domestic opening of over $90 million, with foreign markets bringing its opening weekend to over $230 million. At the time of writing, the film has now earned over $316.9 million domestically and over $678 million internationally (per <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt7286456/?ref_=bo_se_r_1">Box Office Mojo</a>), with today's take evidently being enough to push it past a $1 billion grand total.</p>

      <p><i>Joker</i> is the third non-Disney, non-Universal film to earn $1 billion at the box office since last December, following Warner Bros.' <i>Aquaman</i> and Sony's <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>. Prior to <i>Aquaman</i>, no movie not released by Disney or Universal had crossed the $1 billion mark since Paramount's 2014 release <i>Transformers: Age of Extinction</i>.</p>
      <p>Crossing $1 billion is just the latest in <i>Joker</i>'s growing list of accolades. Late last month, the film topped 20th Century Fox's <i>Deadpool</i> as the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-tops-deadpool-highest-grossing-r-rated-movie-all-time/">highest-grossing</a> R-rated film of all time. With a relatively low budget of $62.5 million, <i>Joker</i>'s runaway success has also made it the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-most-profitable-comic-movie-ever/">most profitable</a> comic book movie in history.</p>
      <p>Directed by Todd Phillips, <a href="https://screenrant.com/joaquin-phoenix-jokers-ending/">Joker</a> stars Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Douglas Hodge, Marc Maron, Josh Pais and Shea Whigham. The film is now in theaters.</p>
