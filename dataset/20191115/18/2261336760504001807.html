      <p>A light heavyweight matchup between Ovince Saint Preux and Ryan Spann is being targeted for a yet-to-be-announced UFC event on February 8th.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ovince-saint-preux-vs-ryan-spann-in-the-works-ufc-february-8-houston">MMA Junkie</a> reported the news, though the UFC is yet to make an official announcement. It’s understood that the event on February 8th will take place in Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>Saint Preux (24-13) most recently picked up the fourth Von Flue choke submission of his UFC career when he beat Michal Oleksiejcuk at UFC Copenhagen in September. ‘OSP’ suffered a submission loss to Nikita Krylov and was on the wrong end of a decision to Dominick Reyes before his most recent win.</p>
      <p>Spann (17-5) earned himself a UFC contract when he impressed on Dana White’s Tuesday Night Contender Series with a 26-second KO. Since then “Superman” has won three straight fights in the UFC, one of which was a first round KO over MMA veteran ‘Minotouro’ Nogueira.</p>
      <p>The UFC is yet to confirm the location and the venue for the card taking place on February 8th, and no other flights have yet been announced to take place on this card￼.</p>
