      <h1>‘Full of hypocrisy’: Jaunita Broaddrick slams Hillary Clinton for tweeting ‘witness intimidation is a crime’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:16:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>Juanita Broaddrick leveled Hillary Clinton after she tweeted, “Witness intimidation is a crime, no matter who does it.”</p>
      <p>On Friday, President Trump tweeted about former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/she-started-off-in-somalia-how-did-that-go-trump-mocks-former-us-ambassador-to-ukraine">Yovanovitch during her impeachment hearing</a>, which prompted Democratic California Rep. Adam Schiff to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/we-take-this-very-seriously-schiff-accuses-trump-of-witness-intimidation">accuse him of witness intimidation</a>, saying, “We saw today witness intimidation in real-time by the president of the United States.”</p>
      <p>Clinton then took to Twitter to condemn Trump, but her tweet backfired online.</p>

      <p>Several people highlighted that Clinton has been accused of intimidating witnesses against her husband, including Juanita Broaddrick, who accused former President Bill Clinton of rape in 1999.</p>
      <p>Broaddrick accused Clinton of trying to intimidate her when she came forward with her allegations, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/did-hillary-clinton-help-bill-clinton-intimidate-and-discredit-his-accusers-714636">saying</a> at the time, “She caught me and took my hand and said, 'I am so happy to meet you. I want you to know that we appreciate everything you do for Bill.' I started to turn away, and she held onto my hand and reiterated her phrase — looking less friendly and repeated her statement — 'everything you do for Bill.'"</p>
      <p>Many pointed this out to Clinton following her tweet about witness intimidation.</p>

      <p>Broaddrick also responded to the tweet herself, calling Clinton “evil” and “full of hypocrisy.” She claimed the former secretary of state has been "threatening and harassing anyone" who could damage her or her husband's career for "decades."</p>

      <p>Broaddrick, 76, has been vocal about her treatment by the Clintons. During Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential bid, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/no-shame-here-juanita-broaddrick-taunts-clinton-adviser-for-request-to-censor-alleged-whistleblower-name">Broaddrick supported Trump</a>, even joining him at one of the presidential debates.</p>
