      <p>Sarkodie has just shared a post that suggests that his wife, Tracy Sarkcess is indeed pregnant.</p>
      <p>They say there’s a little truth in every rumour and it seems Sarkodie has fallen for this saying by subtly revealing that the earlier rumours heard of Tracy’s pregnancy is true.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/sarkodies-wife-tracy-sarkcess-reportedly-expecting-second-baby/">It was revealed by an Instagram gossip in October that the adorable wife of the Ghanaian rapper is pregnant with the rapper’s second child.</a>
      </p>
      <p>According to the report, the BET award winner and his wife have decided to keep the pregnancy out of the eye of the public but the cat will surely let out of the bag in the coming months and Sarkodie did just that.</p>
      <p>In a post on Instagram, Sarkodie shared a video of a baby boy playing on a sofa and wrote on it: <i><b>“Need a baby boy”</b></i>– a confirmation that he’s expecting Tracy to give him a boy.</p>
