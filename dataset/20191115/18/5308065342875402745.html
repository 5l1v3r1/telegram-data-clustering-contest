      <p>Foodpanda released details of the e-scooter trade-in grant scheme from the government, becoming the second food delivery firm, following GrabFood, to release details of the grant for riders.</p>
      <p>Terms for Foodpanda’s two-fold grant scheme include:</p>
      <p>The first version covers riders who have completed 100 working hours delivering food from Oct 9 to Nov 7.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Riders must trade in their e-scooters.</li>
        <li>Riders can claim their e-bicycles by Dec 31 (batch 1) and by Jan 2020 (batch 2).</li>
        <li>Riders can claim their e-bicycles at Foodpanda’s North Rider Hub at Woodlands.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The second version covers riders who have completed less than 100 working hours.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Riders can choose to purchase their own replacement vehicle.</li>
        <li>Riders can then claim a reimbursement of up to S$600 for bicycles and S$1,000 for e-bicycles.</li>
        <li>Upon completing 100 orders by Dec 31, riders can receive half of the grant amount (either S$300 or S$500 depending on the device) then the next half upon completing 100 more orders by Jan 31, 2020.</li>
      </ul>
