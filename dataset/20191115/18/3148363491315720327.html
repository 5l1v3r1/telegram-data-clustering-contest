      <h1>First Lady Melania Trump Labeled 'Porn Star' on Wikimedia's Wikidata Site | Breitbart</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:22:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:22</time> by <a rel="author">T.D. Adler</a></address>
      <p>Numerous high-profile pages on Wikidata, a data site affiliated with Wikipedia, contained long-standing defamatory vandalism <a href="http://wikipediocracy.com/2019/09/05/melania-trump-is-a-former-sex-worker-and-porn-star/">according</a> to criticism site Wikipediocracy. This included First Lady Melania Trump, who was labeled a “former sex worker and porn star” on Wikidata for more than a week. Many Wikipedia-affiliated sites use Wikidata’s information, so the description consequently appeared at her page on Simple Wikipedia, whose target audience expressly includes children, and remained for over a week.</p>
      <p>Other prominent figures affected include <i>Aquaman</i> star Jason Momoa and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was labeled a “rapist” on Wikidata for months. Wikipediocracy’s exposé was authored by veteran administrator “Fram” after he was banned by the Wikimedia Foundation, an unprecedented ban that prompted an <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/06/28/wikipedia-editors-revolt-over-sites-ban-of-veteran-administrator/">editor revolt</a>.</p>
      <p>Numerous sites are under the umbrella of Wikipedia’s owners, the Wikimedia Foundation, each serving varying functions. All are ostensibly open to contributions from the public. Wikidata has been one of the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2016/10/04/supporting-the-future-of-wikidata/">most touted sites</a> by the Foundation in recent years with them seeking to integrate it into various other Wikimedia sites, including the English Wikipedia. Unlike the latter, Wikidata pages are not articles, but tables of information about a subject. Like Wikipedia, Wikidata is relied on by the Big Tech Masters of the Universe. <i>Wired</i> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-alexa-friendly-world-of-wikidata/">notes</a> Wikidata’s structure is particularly well-suited for artificial intelligence and computers, prompting its use for virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home.</p>
      <p>Despite Wikidata having several times more pages than Wikipedia, its <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Statistics">active community</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics">several times</a> smaller. In a September piece for Wikipediocracy, Fram highlighted many instances where Wikidata thus proved vulnerable to vandals on even the most high-profile pages. He reported that a vandal <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q432473&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=962977800&amp;oldid=961447734">edited</a> the Wikidata page for First Lady Melania Trump to label her a “former sex worker and porn star” with the vandalism only <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q432473&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=962977800">removed</a> nine days later. On other Wikimedia sites, such vandalism would be contained, but Wikidata’s integration into other sites meant the derogatory label appeared on image repository Wikimedia Commons and <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Simple Wikipedia</a>, which uses simplified English and explicitly lists children as part of its intended audience.</p>
      <p>Many Wikimedia sites struggle with vandalism and Wikidata is no different. In its piece on Wikidata, <i>Wired</i> reported <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q181900&amp;diff=705658919&amp;oldid=705617034">Wikidata vandalism</a> tricked Apple’s Siri into prematurely reporting the death of comic book legend Stan Lee by four months. While removed <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q181900&amp;diff=705746398&amp;oldid=705746328">within hours</a>, Fram’s piece establishes plenty of vandalism is not removed quickly. Usual subjects of long-standing vandalism tended to be more obscure or from other parts of the world such as Mexican actor <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q5796155&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=960087768&amp;oldid=886251386">Cesar Bono</a> and Bollywood actress <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q59513147&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=956290147&amp;oldid=956289687">Sara Ali Khan</a>, whose Wikidata pages were vandalized for weeks and the vandalism propagated to other Wikimedia sites as a result.</p>
      <p>A particular point of vulnerability for Wikidata Fram identifies is vandalism in non-English languages. On the Spanish Wikipedia, the page for Jason Momoa, who played the titular role in the <i>Aquaman</i> movie and is married to actress Lisa Bonet, used Wikidata’s <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q315271&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=959418588&amp;oldid=939076029">description of him</a> as a homosexual <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q315271&amp;diff=978719159&amp;oldid=972669568">for weeks</a>. Country music star Billy Ray Cyrus was described in the native South American Mapuche language as a “porn actress” <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q231259&amp;diff=187206981&amp;oldid=187206977">from 2015</a> to <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q231259&amp;diff=1009727058&amp;oldid=1009470900">after</a> Fram’s piece was published.</p>
      <p>Such issues with Wikidata are a long-time concern for critics of Wikipedia and members of its community with Fram particularly active in drawing attention to the problem. Fram <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive950#Hard_to_detect_mobile_vandalism">raised</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_154#Discussion_at_ANI_about_Wikidata_use_in_mobile_view">issues</a> with Wikidata vandalism appearing on the mobile version of English Wikipedia in 2017 and his efforts resulted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_138#Rfc:_Remove_description_taken_from_Wikidata_from_mobile_view_of_en-WP">exclusion</a> of Wikidata descriptions. His efforts also ended up before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case&amp;oldid=812449556#Crosswiki_issues">Arbitration Committee</a>, often likened to a Supreme Court, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case&amp;oldid=812449556#Crosswiki_issues:_Motion">a motion</a> by the Committee halted community efforts to force integration of Wikidata into the English Wikipedia.</p>
      <p>His work to counter integration of Wikidata into Wikimedia sites, especially English Wikipedia, was part of Fram’s broader criticism of actions taken by the Foundation and connected figures on the site that he felt were harming Wikipedia’s reliability and overall quality. Claims Fram was uncivil with error-prone members on the site were described by the Wikimedia Foundation as “harassment” to justify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Fram&amp;diff=901256511&amp;oldid=830516565">banning him</a> for a year in June of this year.</p>
      <p>In his <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFram&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=353945503&amp;oldid=353863587">first response</a> to the ban, Fram took the opportunity to highlight long-standing vandalism to the Wikidata page on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who had been <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q4962244&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=899071721&amp;oldid=867193516">described</a> as a “rapist” on the page since late March. The label was <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q4962244&amp;oldid=959911815">removed</a> and associated revisions <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Q4962244">deleted</a> shortly after he noted it. Kavanaugh was previously targeted by users of Wikimedia sites, including by <a href="https://medium.com/@tdadlerwp/former-wikipedia-admin-used-sockpuppet-for-anti-kavanaugh-editing-campaign-7b7ec106100e">a ban-evading editor</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
      <p>The Foundation banning Fram represented an unprecedented intrusion into Wikipedia’s self-governing process and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case&amp;oldid=812449556#Crosswiki_issues:_Motion">sparked a revolt</a>. Although the Committee was eventually <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/07/15/wikipedia-owners-back-down-on-ban-of-veteran-administrator-following-editor-revolt/">permitted</a> to review Fram’s ban and <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/10/23/wikipedia-revolt-partly-successful-as-ban-of-veteran-admin-overturned/">overturned it</a>, they cited him “excessively highlighting” other’s failures to argue against restoring his administrator privileges. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Fram/Evidence">Evidence</a> presented during the largely private case included his past conflicts with editors over integration of Wikidata into Wikipedia, though much of the case evidence was criticized as misrepresented and as coming from dubious sources.</p>
      <p>Problems with Wikidata’s integration into other Wikimedia sites and popular virtual assistants mirror the issues with Big Tech’s <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/03/14/big-brother-youtube-to-fact-check-conspiracy-theory-videos-with-wikipedia/">reliance</a> <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/04/04/facebook-tries-to-discredit-breitbart-news-by-attaching-wikipedia-smear-job-to-links/">on Wikipedia</a> as a response to the “fake news” issue. Using the Wikipedia model to “fix journalism” has also been <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/19/internet-broke-journalism-fake-news/">pushed</a> by co-founder Jimmy Wales with his news outlet WikiTribune. Aside from <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/05/31/google-wikipedia-list-nazism-as-california-gops-top-ideology/">vandalism</a>, both <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/02/01/five-of-the-best-examples-of-left-wing-bias-on-wikipedia-in-2017/">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/10/30/wikipedia-co-founder-jimmy-wales-uses-wikitribune-outlet-to-advance-global-goals-agenda/">WikiTribune</a> have suffered the same issues of <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/08/27/wikipedia-president-trump-advocate-of-neo-nazi-conspiracy-theory/">widespread</a> <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/07/18/wikipedia-editors-protect-antifa-by-censoring-andy-ngo-assault-ice-attack/">political</a> <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/08/21/wikipedia-echoes-democrats-with-ice-concentration-camp-label/">bias</a>.</p>
