      <p>NORTH FORT MYERS, Fla. â€” A North Fort Myers man was found guilty in a Lee County Court.</p>
      <p>Joseph Leonard Rill, 35, was charged with Possession of a Firearm or Ammunition by a Convicted Felon, Driving While License or Driving Privilege Suspended, Revoked, or Canceled 3rd or More, and Resisting an Officer without Violence.</p>
      <p>Rill led police on a slow-speed chase in June while riding a moped without a tag.</p>
      <p>When police finally stopped Rill, a Sergeant noticed a .32 caliber revolver inside an unbuttoned holster in an open pocket-console right below the handlebars of the scooter.</p>
      <p>Rill has been designated as a Habitual Felony Offender.</p>
      <p>Sentencing is scheduled for January 6, 2020.</p>
