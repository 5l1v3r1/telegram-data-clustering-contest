      <p>Michael Bloomberg’s yet-to-be-launched 2020 presidential campaign snagged its first endorsement — from the Sunshine State.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg met this week with former Miami Beach mayor and Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Philip Levine, who <a href="https://pagesix.com/2017/12/30/wealthy-supporters-rally-behind-miami-mayor-in-governor-race/?_ga=2.223748383.522465069.1572752179-1686751354.1558972148">told The Post</a> he’s on the former New York City mayor’s 2020 team.</p>
      <p>“If Mike Bloomberg runs for President, he will command the support of current and former mayors across America. I would be one of them,” said Levine, who considers Bloomberg a mentor.</p>
      <p>“As a fellow Mayor, Mike was and is considered one of the greatest mayors in history,” he added. “If he throws his hat in the ring, I believe he would present the President with the most formidable challenge in the field.”</p>
      <p>Like billionaire Bloomberg, Levine is a self-made businessman who amassed a fortune from his cruise line industry firms and real estate. And, like Bloomberg, he then used his wealth to bankroll his campaigns.</p>
      <p>Levine described Bloomberg as a “centrist” who also “checks nearly every major progressive box from climate change, gun control to LGBTQ rights and more,” Levine said.</p>
      <p>“As a true self- made entrepreneur, he’s in the unique position of being able to reassure every American that today’s good economy will become even stronger and more inclusive tomorrow,” he said.</p>
      <p>Levine came in third in Florida’s Democratic primary for governor last year, behind Andrew Gillum and Gwen Graham. Gillum <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/17/gillum-concedes-florida-governors-race-to-gops-desantis/">lost to Republican Ron DeSantis</a> in the general election.</p>
