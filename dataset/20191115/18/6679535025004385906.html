      <h2>Mud-bamboo units modelled on traditional Muthuvan houses</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:06:38+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Giji-K-Raman-225/" target="_blank">Giji K. Raman</a></address>
      <p>Eco-friendly housing is being introduced for the tribespeople living in the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary thanks to the efforts of a few Forest Department officials. The concept was introduced following the finding that the tribespeople had abandoned the asbestos, tin-roofed and concrete houses built for them under various government schemes. They had gone back to live in their traditional huts made using bamboo reed and grasses. They had a reason for that — to beat the extreme cold.</p>
      <p>Mud houses with grass roofs trap the heat from the hearth and keep the houses warm throughout the night.</p>
      <p>The concept of eco-compatible houses was mooted by P.M. Prabhu, the then assistant wildlife warden there nearly two years ago. With the aid of Praveen P. Mohandas, an architect engaged in the construction of eco-friendly houses, the concept was presented before the Department of Environment and Climate Change, which gave the nod for the houses after technical verification. Thus came up the first eco-compatible house in the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary and construction of a few more houses is under way there.</p>
      <h3>Many hurdles</h3>
      <p>Mr. Prabhu, now Assistant Conservator of Forest (Social Forestry), told <i>The Hindu </i>that there were many hurdles in implementing the project as it was a new concept and the PWD manual had a specified criteria for house construction and expenditure.</p>
      <p>He said the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary was most suited for eco-compatible houses as change in climate was most evident there. “There are settlements like Palapetty at an elevation of 1,200 m while Mangapara is at 500 m. The eco-compatible houses should be apt for the settlements in very high altitudes and average high altitudes,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said ₹40 lakh was allocated for a project to beat climate change in the forest areas and a major share of it was used for building eco-compatible houses. He said that tribespeople were noted for judicious use of space.</p>
      <p>The houses constructed earlier under various schemes did not consider their requirements and this might be one reason why they abandoned the houses.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Kerala Institute for Research Training &amp; Development Studies of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (KIRTADS) conducted a two-day workshop on ‘Ethnography and houses of Muthuvan community of idukki’ in Munnar. The concept of eco-compatible houses was presented there and it received much accolades.</p>
      <p>Mr. Mohandas said the eco-compatible</p>
      <p>houses were modelled on the mud-bamboo houses built by the Muthuvan community traditionally. “They are built using hollow mud blocks called ‘Kurudees’ that require very little cement. Roof will be paved with clay tiles supported by iron framework,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary has 11 tribal settlements at different elevations. Champakkad area remains hot and humid most of the time as it is located in the rain-shadow region. However, colonies like Ollavayal, Mangappara and Vellakkal are located in higher elevations and the climate is cooler.</p>
