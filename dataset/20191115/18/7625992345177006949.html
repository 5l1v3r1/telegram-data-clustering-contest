      <h1>"Will you be my kidney sista?": Mom battling Lupus gets organ donation from daughter's teacher</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:30:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin O'Kane</a></address>
      <p>Tracy Shearin-Drayton, a preschool teacher and mom from Greensboro, North Carolina, thought she'd have to wait five to eight years to get a kidney transplant. Shearin-Drayton was diagnosed with Lupus in 2009, and in August, she made public plea for a kidney donation, sharing her story with <a href="https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/news/local/good-morning-show/greensborowileyelementaryteachertracyshearindraytonwithlupusneedskidney/83-3c7fe6f9-d9cf-45c2-8449-c38c2f163d7c">local news station WFMY.</a></p>
      <p>Now, the wait is over. Shearin-Drayton has found her "kidney sister" – and it's someone who was close to her 8-year-old daughter, Jada.</p>
      <p>Pam Oast taught Jada when she was in kindergarten. After hearing 31-year-old Shearin-Drayton was on the registry for a new kidney in Pittsburg, Oast got tested to be a donor match, hoping to save the mom.</p>
      <p>Shearin-Drayton has a rare blood type – B-positive – but Oast ended up being a perfect match. She decided to pay a visit to Shearin-Drayton in the hospital and surprise her with the news.</p>
      <p>"I've always wanted to give, always. I've given my whole life, and I feel like that's what I was put here for," <a href="https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/life/heartwarming/greensboro-teacher-battling-lupus-kidney-donation/83-e4ab5c0e-e140-4aa0-a791-42058f8f279d">Oast told WFMY.</a></p>
      <p>As Shearin-Drayton lay in her hospital bed, battling complications from her dialysis treatment, Oast crept in holding a sign. "Will you be my kidney sista?" the sign read.</p>

      <p>Upon reading it, Shearin-Dayton was overcome with emotions. "I cried. I screamed. So many emotions ran through my body," she told WFMY.</p>
      <p>The surprise was caught on video and has gone viral. Shearin-Dayton wailed. She was in disbelief that her daughter's former teacher had become her savior.</p>
      <p>Oast has to undergo more tests, but when they are complete, she and Shearin-Dayton will go to Pittsburgh for the procedure. "It doesn't scare me one bit," Oast said. "If I can help save her life and make her life better so she can be here for [Jada] then I'll do it."</p>
