      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:00:13+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The investigation into the death of 19-year-old student Fathima Latheef on the Indian Institute of Technology campus here has been transferred to the Central Crime Branch (CB) following allegations levelled by her parents about harassment from faculty members and subsequent condemnation from political parties and student organisations.</p>
      <p>Fathima, a first-year student of M.A. Humanities, reportedly ended her life on Saturday in her hostel room. On going through her mobile phone, her parents said that they had learnt that she had been harassed by faculty and discriminated against on religious grounds.</p>
      <p>They found fault with the police for giving the impression that she took the extreme step as she was not doing well in her semester exams.</p>
      <p>Chennai City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, accompanied by senior officers, visited the campus on Thursday. He held a preliminary inquiry with staff and police officers. Mr. Viswanathan then told journalists that the investigation had been transferred to the Central Crime Branch from the Kotturpuram police.</p>
      <p>A special team had been formed under C. Easwaramurthy, Additional Commissioner of Police, Central Crime Branch. Meghalina, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Special Wing for Crime against Women and Children, would be the investigating officer.</p>
      <h3>Jaleel visits house</h3>
      <p>Staff Reporter writes from Kollam:</p>
      <p>Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel has said that students at prime educational institutions are increasingly facing discrimination and measures have been taken to avoid such incidents in Kerala.</p>
      <p>He was speaking to the media after visiting the family of Fathima Latheef, who was found dead in her hostel room at IIT, Madras, last Saturday. “Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has contacted the Tamil Nadu government and they said they will extend all possible cooperation in the case. ,” he said here on Friday.</p>
      <p>Fathima's sister Aysha explained the sequence of events to the Minister and said her sister seemed extremely distressed the day before she ended her life. Fathima’s mother requested the Minister to ensure that such incidents were not repeated and there should be no more Fathimas.</p>
      <p>Mayor V. Rajendrababu was present on the occasion.</p>
      <h3>Intervened actively</h3>
      <p>Special Correspondent writes from Thiruvananthapuram:</p>
      <p>The State government told the Assembly on Friday that it had intervened actively on behalf of the parents of Fathima Latheef for a fair inquiry into the suspected suicide of the student.</p>
      <p>Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran, standing in for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, said Fathima</p>
      <p>a high academic achiever, had no apparent reason to commit suicide. Her parents had belatedly learnt that Fathima was in intense duress. Her mobile phone messages indicated that some person in the faculty had discriminated against her for her religious faith. They also told the Chief Minister that they felt the Chennai police appeared unconvinced about their doubts.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sudhakaran said the Chief Minister instructed State Police Chief Loknath Behera to take up the matter with his counterpart in Tamil Nadu.</p>
