      <p>The New Jersey man <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/new-jersey-man-charged-with-manslaughter-of-woman-during-sex-romp-in-car/">who choked a woman to death</a> during a drunken sex romp posted a photo of the victim’s dead, naked body on Snapchat before he called for help, reports said.</p>
      <p>Michael Gaffney, 21, who’s been held in Bergen County since early November, was remanded on Wednesday by Superior Court Judge Margaret Foti, who cited the callous post, along with Gaffney’s history of substance abuse, as her reasons for refusing bail, <a href="https://www.nj.com/bergen/2019/11/killer-strangled-her-and-posted-pic-on-snapchat-before-calling-for-help-officials-allege.html">NJ.com reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“Just (expletive) this bitch. She passed out. I don’t know what to do,” Gaffney wrote on Snapchat, according to Foti, who read the post to the courtroom during a Wednesday hearing.</p>
      <p>Gaffney was arrested back on Nov. 2 and charged with manslaughter for killing Francis Victoria Garcia, 19, by choking her while having sex.</p>
      <p>The two had met through mutual friends and decided to hook up in Garcia’s car after attending a raucous Halloween party at a Hackensack high-rise building that Friday night.</p>
      <p>After Gaffney choked Garcia, the woman passed out and Gaffney posted the picture to Snapchat <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/she-wanted-to-be-choked-nj-man-tells-pal-after-fatal-sex-romp-court-docs/">before calling some friends</a> for help.</p>
      <p>Garcia was found in her car around 2:14 a.m. and was pronounced dead shortly after.</p>
      <p>The man’s attorney, Adam Lustberg, told NJ.com on Friday that he’s waiting for a “more detailed autopsy report” that may give a clearer answer to what happened to Garcia.</p>
      <p>So far, the medical examiner has ruled Garcia died from a neck compression and her blood alcohol content was nearly three times the legal limit.</p>
