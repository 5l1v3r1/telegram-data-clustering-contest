      <p>digiFMS is a computer-based system which is used to monitor the many activities of a regular residential metropolitan building / multiple buildings.</p>
      <p>The concept of digiFMS took  root from the fact that various large building complexes need monitoring and maintenance for their various day to day activities.</p>
      <p>In a normal residential society, the day to day chores include maintenance of the society, plumbing, parking allocations, waste management, security facilities, tracking dues, vendor management, tenant management, asset management, visitor management, maintenance requests, inventory management etc.</p>
      <p>The major advantage of digiFMS is that a high level of automation can be introduced. which not only reduces risks of errors but also helps solve all the problems.</p>
      <p>CTC Consolidated Services, Inc. was recently appointed by Amaze One as the authorized reseller and distributor of digiFMS in the country. Amaze One is the software company and  the developer of digiFMS. </p>
