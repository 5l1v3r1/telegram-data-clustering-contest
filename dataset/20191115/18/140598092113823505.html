      <h1>Greggs boss skips his sausage rolls and steak bakes in attempt to 'go vegan'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/patrick-sawer/" target="_blank">Patrick Sawer</a></address>
      <p>He is known as the nation’s most famous purveyor of sausage rolls, but now the boss of Greggs has turned his back on one of his firm’s best selling products.</p>
      <p>Roger Whiteside, the chief executive of the Newcastle-based bakery chain, has declared he is trying to go vegan.</p>
      <p>Which means he will no longer be able to savour the delights of Greggs’ sausage rolls or bacon and cheese wraps, never mind its legendary steak bake, a pastry parcel packed with “diced cuts of prime beef in a rich and tasty gravy”.</p>
      <p>Mr Whiteside said he his attempting to make the switch and cut out animal produce from his own diet, at least for a while, after watching a Netflix documentary called The Gamechangers.</p>

      <p>Speaking after being crowned this year's North East Business Executive of the Year he said: “If you'd asked me three weeks ago which roll I preferred I would have said the original sausage roll, but I'm now attempting to live on a vegan diet.</p>
      <p>"Obviously there are arguments based around animal welfare and the environment, but this was all about the health benefits, and I thought I should give it a go.</p>
      <p>"Avoiding meat is easy. The problem is avoiding dairy, avoiding milk and cheese is almost impossible. It would be okay if I had time to cook, but I don't, so I have to have things that are quick and easy."</p>

      <p>Greggs public relations department, keen to avoid a Ratner-style PR disaster - in which the businessman Gerald Ratner in 1991 described the products his jewellery firm sold as “total crap” - was swift to point out that their stores provided many tasty and nutritious vegan alternatives for their boss.</p>
      <p>These include an award-winning Mexican bean and sweet potato wrap, fruit pots, and of course their now famous vegan sausage roll, launched in January to the apoplectic fury of a number of commentators, including Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan.</p>
      <p>Which means Mr Whiteside need not go hungry when he finds himself passing one of his 2,000 branches.</p>
      <p>"We've got the award-winning vegan wrap which I have quite frequently and the vegan sausage roll which I'll have about once a week, and now we have the sweet choice with the vegan sweet mince pie,” he said.</p>
