      <p>In an attempt to raise awareness on child safety, the Coimbatore Chapter of Project Masoom, an initiative by Young Indians (Yi), organised a rally in which college students walked backwards here on Friday.</p>
      <p>Titled ‘Walking Back to Innocence’, the rally signified adults realising the innocence of children, according to Rajalakshmi Vishnu, chairperson of Coimbatore Chapter of Project Masoom. “It takes adults to create a safer environment for children,” she told <i>The Hindu.</i></p>
      <p>The event saw the participation of nearly 500 students from eight private colleges in the city. Carrying placards with slogans on child safety, the students started walking backwards from Race Course Scheme Road and continued the rally on the walking track on Race Course Road. About 100 school band students from two private schools provided musical accompaniment during the rally.</p>
      <p>Prior to the rally, Jayshree Ravi from the Coimbatore Seva Nilayam and Rajalaxmi, founder, Health and Emotions, addressed the students on various aspects of child safety and flagged off the rally. Aishwarya Arjun, co-chair, Yi Coimbatore Chapter, was also present.</p>
      <p>Project Masoom has been spreading awareness about child sexual abuse and cyber safety to children and adults for five years. Masoom week is celebrated across all 43 chapters of Yi, the youth wing of Confederation of Indian Industry, from November 14 to November 20 every year, a release says.</p>
