        <b>A 42-YEAR-old man admitted killing a dad outside Edinburgh City Football Club's social club by stabbing him on the neck with knife.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paul Smith, who is charged with murdering electrician Andrew McCarron at Lochend Road South, Edinburgh, on July 21 offered to plead guilty to the reduced charge of culpable homicide at Glasgow's High Court.</p>

      <p>The plea was tendered by Smith's solicitor advocate Brian Gilfedder.</p>
      <p>But it was not accepted by prosecutor Lisa Gillespie.</p>
      <p>Smith denies murdering Mr McCarron and assaulting Robert Smith to his permanent disfigurement by repeatedly striking him on the body with a knife.</p>
      <p>Judge Lord Matthews set a trial date for April 14 at the High Court in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>After his death, McCarron's family issued a statement.</p>
      <p>It read: "Andrew was a loving family man, a kind soul and an Aston Villa fan through and through, who was sadly taken away from us on Sunday 21st July.</p>
      <p>"He will be dearly missed by his parents, siblings, children, family and friends.</p>
      <p>"The loss of our beloved Andrew is immeasurable, but so also, is the love he left behind.</p>
      <p>"Rest in Peace, Andrew."</p>
