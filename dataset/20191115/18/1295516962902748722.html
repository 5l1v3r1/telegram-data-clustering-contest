      <p>Though it was a part of a heist, Spider-Man and Black Cat officially tied the knot in <i>Black Cat Annual</i> #1. Of course, you're allowed to question the logistics and ethics of a priest hired by the Maggia crime families being certified to hand out marriage licenses, but Peter Parker and Felicia Hardy technically completed the marriage ceremony.</p>
      <p>Near the end of the issue, we learn that Spider-Man and Black Cat went undercover to help a couple in love escape their families after they were selected to marry and fight to the death in the name of martyrdom and family honor. While Spider-Man and Black Cat were sneaking through the Maggia catacombs under the St. Nicholas Church, two members of Black Cat's team were fulfilling their parts of the plan to steal millions of dollars out from under the crime family's nose.</p>

      <p>With S.H.I.E.L.D. no more and Hydra going underground, the Maggia has found it useful to stash all of their their junk there in a world without S.H.I.E.L.D. and where Hydra has been forced underground. But no one could have expected the "newlyweds" to reveal themselves to the crowd while also wearing Hydra masks and screaming out their vilified catchphrase.</p>
      <h3>Hail Hydra</h3>

      <p>Black Cat's plan involves her hired muscle stealing an automobile from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. decommissioned yard. Once the techie of the crew breaks the encryption on a Maggia member's bank account to illegally transfer funds, the muscle appears at the drop-off point with a Hydra mask on his head.</p>
      <p>This leads us to Spider-Man and Black Cat emerging from the catacombs -- still wearing their wedding attire -- as the assembled wedding audience waits to see if the bride or groom was victorious in their fight to the death. However, what the church isn't expecting to see is the bride and groom hand-in-hand yelling "Hail Hydra" while raising smoke bombs in the air.</p>

      <p>As you can imagine, the audience is left stunned at the shocking turn of events. Not only has their wedding been crashed, but two people in Hydra masks are now attacking them with smoke bombs. It's possible the families of the bride and groom assume it's their son and daughter joining the terrorist group, but at this point in time that's really irrelevant. Mob leader Silvio has his money stolen out from under him and they've been publicly embarrassed. It's hard to think of a more humiliating evening with your friends and family.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, <a href="https://screenrant.com/spiderman-sister-killer-murderer/">Spider-Man</a> and Black Cat risk their lives in order to help two kids in love escape their unfortunate circumstances. The bride and groom recall how both their parents were former martyrs, but once the prospect of killing the person they love came into play, they decide to chart their own futures. Luckily, Black Cat is inspired by their story and recruits Spider-Man to help, knowing his sense of responsibility will prevent him from saying no.</p>
      <p>All it takes to pull off the heist is a suit, wedding gown, some old Hydra gear and a lot of luck, which Black Cat is more than familiar with.</p>
