      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 15 – RIA Tomsk.</b> After obtaining permission of supervisory structures Tomsk meat processing plant of Siberian Agrarian Group intends to start supplying raw pork to 10 countries of near and far abroad, including Japan and the Philippines, director of enterprise Andrei Vasilyev told reporters, noting that demand for chilled meat is also growing in domestic market.</p>
      <p>Earlier it was reported that the Tomsk meat processing plant planned to invest 100 million rubles in the modernization of the packaging line in 2018, which would allow to increase the shelf life of chilled products (minced meat, sausage, lump meat) from 10 to 14 days. After that, the company expected to significantly expand the geography of deliveries.</p>
      <p>On Friday, November 15, the employees of the meat processing plant conducted a tour of the enterprise for Tomsk journalists. Attention was mainly drawn to a new line for the manufacture of chilled goulashes, steaks and minced meat. According to Vasilyev, automation and minimization of personnel participation allowed to increase the shelf life of products to 20 days.</p>
      <blockquote>"Last week we passed the certification of the Rosselkhoznadzor, and I think that we will open 10 countries on the supply of meat", – Vasilyev said, specifying that the company intends to export pork, in particular, to Japan and the Philippines.</blockquote>
