      <p>Residents across Swadlincote have been hit with problems with their water supply.</p>
      <p>Severn Trent, which is responsible for the water supply in South Derbyshire, has confirmed there are issued in the DE11 postcode area, which includes Swadlincote, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/swadlincote-pre-school-slammed-ofsted-3539196">Newhall</a>, Woodville Church and Castle Gresley, Midway, Albert Village, Hartshorne, Blackfordby and Boundary.</p>
      <p>One resident, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/50s-american-diner-swadlincote-new-3526876">who lives in Church Gresley</a>, said: "I was doing my daughter's washing, and couldn't work out why it wasn't working. But then I realised there was no water going into it, so of course it wouldn't work. I then tried the taps and nothing was working.</p>
      <p>"We had some hot water, but only because that's in the tank in the loft.</p>
      <p>"We've been on the phone to Severn Trent for 11 minutes and still haven't gotten through to anyone."</p>
      <p>It is not yet known when the water supply will be restored in the area.</p>
      <p>On its website Severn Trent said: "Customers in the DE11 postcode area may be experiencing supply interruptions this evening. Our team on site have discovered that this is due to a burst main.</p>
      <p>"Our priority is getting customers water supply back to normal. We'll keep this page updated as and when we find out more from our engineers on site. Apologies for any inconvenience this causes to your evening."</p>
