      <p>He was injured when a car ran a red light in Manchester and hit him.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, the Blues supporter wrote: "Life comes at you nearly as fast as speeding cars that don't stop on red lights do.</p>
      <p>"Didn't think it was possible for me to get any uglier but here we are with my face drooping to the right and the left side of it not working, you not reckon it's time I caught a break".</p>
      <p>Responding to a tweet suggesting what happened was ‘karma’, Perkins replied: "Leg it bruv, karma for laughing at somebody being dead is not fracturing your skull in two places hahaha."</p>

      <p>Perkins posted messages about the tragic death of Keelan Grealish in March as he watched the most recent meeting between Blues and Villa.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/blues-fans-sick-boast-after-17084875">He had denied the charges but was convicted at trial</a> and fined £120, ordered to pay £200 court costs and a £30 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>Perkins, an accountancy and finance student at the University of Salford, had been drinking from 7am when he posted three tweets minutes after <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-jack-grealish-attack-16021182">Grealish was attacked on the pitch at St Andrew's by a fan who ran from the stands.</a></p>

      <p>One showed a picture of the headstone of Grealish’s brother, Keelan, who died as a baby.</p>
      <p>The text on the tweet said: “He may have scored but will never bring his dead brother back and that brings me more satisfaction than anything else ever could.”</p>
      <p>Another tweet read: “Grealish went down quicker than his brother got lowered into the grave.”</p>
      <p>The third said: “Where’s your brother gone? Come on!”</p>
