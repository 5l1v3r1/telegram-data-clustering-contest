      <p>Rafael Nadal celebrated ending the year as world number one with victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas at the ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>Roger Federer’s win over Novak Djokovic the night before ensured Nadal will become the oldest man to finish the season top of the tree.</p>
      <p>It is the fifth time Nadal has ended the year ranked first, tying with Federer, Djokovic and Jimmy Connors.</p>

      <p>However, if he is to go on and win his first ATP Finals title, the 33-year-old Spaniard needs a favour from Daniil Medvedev later on Friday.</p>
      <p>If Medvedev beats defending champion Alexander Zverev, Nadal will meet Federer in a blockbuster semi-final. If Medvedev loses, Nadal is out.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, he will leave London with some silverware after being presented with the year-end world number one trophy.</p>
      <p>Nadal said: “I’m super happy, after all the things I went through in my career in terms of injuries, to have this trophy in my hands at the age of 33-and-a-half.</p>
      <p>“It’s something really, really emotional for me, a lot of work. Without all my team and family here, this would be impossible, so thank you very, very much.”</p>
      <p>Nadal had somehow recovered from 5-1 and match point down to beat Medvedev on Wednesday, and he needed to come from behind again to overhaul Greek youngster Tsitsipas, who put up a tremendous fight for someone who had already booked his place in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Both players dropped just seven points on serve as the first set moved inexorably towards a tie-break, and it was Tsitsipas who took it with an ace.</p>
      <p>After an hour and 18 minutes Nadal brought up the first break points of the match, but Tsitsipas repelled both, and another in his next service game.</p>

      <p>However, at 4-4 Nadal eked out a fourth break point and this time made it stick, Tsitsipas spraying a forehand wide and surrendering the set.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas’ unforced error count was on the increase as Nadal kept up the pressure. He created five break points in the deciding set, while Tsitsipas did not force one all match.</p>
      <p>The breakthrough came at 5-5, Tsitsipas unable to control a volley from another punishing Nadal forehand, and after two hours and 52 minutes the 19-time grand slam winner wrapped up a 6-7 (4) 6-4 7-5 victory.</p>
