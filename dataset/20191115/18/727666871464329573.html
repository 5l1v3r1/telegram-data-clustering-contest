      <h1>Damon Dash Denies Reports He Is Broke In Dispute Over $2,400 Debt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">AllHipHop Staff</a></address>
      <p>The former boss of the Roc-A-Fella empire is apparently tight on cash according to court papers he filed.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Rap mogul Damon Dash is denying reports he's in poverty after allegedly struggling to come up with the $2,400 he owes in an ongoing legal battle.</p>
      <p>Jay-Z's former business partner was previously ordered to pay the figure as part of a lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Reports suggested Dame doesn't have the money to do so because he has no salary and his current ventures are not making a profit.</p>
      <p>"Perfect example of how they always trying to make a strong independent black man look broke," Damon Dash fumed on Instagram. "This is the narrative they push no mention of my 24 network or my streaming service...or my galleries just bubblegum shit... @tmz_tv y’all corny for that but the agenda is clear...Keep it up ...I’m gonna keep making examples of y’all by winning."</p>
      <p>In documents obtained by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/14/damon-dash-broke-cant-pay-debt-lawsuit-lee-daniels/">TMZ</a>, Damon acknowledged he was receiving regular checks from director Lee Daniels.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/rumors/lee-daniels-says-he-has-dame-dash-s-money-QQ3wNTEb4U6hFxdZkfs3tg/">Last year, Daniels agreed to pay over $1.7 million to end a contract dispute related to a Richard Pryor biopic.</a>
      </p>
      <p>But Dame insists those funds are already being drained by creditors to help settle other debts.</p>
      <p>He is now requesting a little leniency from court officials so he can pay the $2,400 in early 2020.</p>
      <p>"My income streams have all been garnished... and it is very difficult to address the mounting bills until I receive some relief from the courts," according to court documents.</p>
      <p>It's not clear which lawsuit the payment is part of, but it's not the first time Dash has raised the issue of financial trouble in court.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/dame-dash-reportedly-argues-his-56-000-income-is-too-low-to-cover-child-support-1pG3ZewrVE6aVTRN7L3BlQ/">In September, he asked to have his child support payments to his ex-wife, designer Rachel Roy, terminated after making just over $56,000 in 2018.</a>
      </p>
      <p>He also revealed his fiancee, Raquel Horn, is pregnant, which has put further strain on his cash flow due to unexpected medical expenses.</p>
      <p>Damon took to Instagram to bash TMZ.com over the report, claiming he is far from being broke. </p>
