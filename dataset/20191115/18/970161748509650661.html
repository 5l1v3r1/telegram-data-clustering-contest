      <p>The Mandalorian has finally revealed the significance of that mind-blowing twist at the end of its first episode.</p>
      <p>The series is the first live-action TV series set in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> universe, tracking the life of the titular bounty hunter (played by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game of Thrones</a>’ Pedro Pascal) as he journeys throughout a galaxy in chaos.</p>
      <p>We were already told that the serial – which is set after the events of Return of the Jedi but before The Force Awakens –<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/the-mandalorian-will-drop-a-serious-star-wars-spoiler-in-its-first-episode-what-could-it-be-11002006/"> would feature a ‘major’ Star Wars spoiler in its first episode</a>, and it didn’t disappoint.</p>
      <p>During the closing moments of the first installment of the space opera, we were treated to a brief glimpse of what appeared to be…<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/mandalorian-introduces-baby-yoda-star-wars-fans-obviously-internet-cannot-handle-11089019/">Baby Yoda</a>!</p>
      <p>Now, the second episode of the series expands on this tantalising twist – and reveals why this significant moment is tied in with creator Jon Favareau’s classification of the show as a ‘space-western.’</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/oh-so-the-mandalorian-is-really-going-to-be-about-that-1839861046">io9</a>, the new ep will be titled The Child and see our favourite helmeted bounty-hunter (sorry Boba Fett!) take on the responsibility for looking after this mysterious child and try to take the child to safety as they escape a hostile planet.</p>

      <p>The theme of a lone gunman finding a helpless soul to care after (and thereby redeem himself for past wrongs) is a common trope in the Western genre, which The Mandalorian emulates just with a lot more aliens.</p>
      <p>A few famous westerns the show could be referencing include True Grit and Unforgiven.</p>
      <p>So, Baby Yoda (we’re calling it Baby Yoda because that seems like the general consensus right now – Yoda of course died before the events of the show) could well help set The Mandalorian on the path to redemption.</p>
      <p>But what does it all mean? Is he the actual reincarnation of the Jedi Master? Another member of his species? Or a weapon to fight the emerging First Order?</p>
      <p>If this isn’t enough Star Wars content for you – we still have<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/ewan-mcgregor-says-the-obi-wan-kenobi-star-wars-prequel-will-explore-the-characters-trauma-between-episodes-iii-and-iv-11048729/"> Ewan McGregor’s return as Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> to look forward to, as well as the release of Rise of Skywalker, which apparently will still <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/star-wars-naomi-ackie-warns-rise-skywalker-ending-will-leave-fans-questions-11127079/">leave fans with ‘questions.’ </a></p>
