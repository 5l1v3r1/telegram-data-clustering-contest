      <p>Eminent dancers decoded nuances of Indian classical dance forms at a workshop held here on Friday in connection with the silver jubilee celebrations of Chetana Centre for Culture and Communications.</p>
      <p>Odissi dancer Vrindha Chadha adopted a very simple and interactive approach in her demonstrative lecture on Odissi.</p>
      <h3>Keen interest</h3>
      <p>The young audience, including students of various schools, took keen interest in the video presentation she did along with the live demonstration of the typical features of Odyssey and its socio-religious significance in Odisha.</p>
      <p>She made the presentation extremely interesting by comparing the mudras, the spins, and other techniques in Odissi with Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi with which a majority of the young audiences were familiar.</p>
      <p>Ms. Chadha also presented full-scale dance performances as an extension of the demo lecture, which enthralled all.</p>
      <p>Kathak dancer Adhithi Bhagwath, explained the evolution of the dance in her demonstration lecture. The audience could witness the rapid footwork and beauty of Kathak when she did a live performance.</p>
      <p>The programme concluded with a Bharatnatyam performance by Fr. Saju George, a Jesuit priest hailing from Elanji, Kottayam, who is popularly known as the ‘dancing priest’.</p>
      <h3>Students perform</h3>
      <p>The performance started at 7 p.m. and was a treat to the classical dance enthusiasts. Fr. Saju was accompanied by the members of the ‘Kalahridya’ dance troupe, Kolkata, that he founded. Earlier, the students of Chetana Sangeet Natya Academy presented various classical dance forms.</p>
      <p>T.K. Narayanan, Vice Chancellor of Kerala Kalamandalam Deemed University, formally inaugurated the events on Friday. Fr. Paul Poovathingal, director of Chetana Collective and chairperson of the silver jubilee committee, presided. Ms. Bhagavath was felicitated on the occasion.</p>
