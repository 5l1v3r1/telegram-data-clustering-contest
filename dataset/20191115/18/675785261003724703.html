      <h1>Kate Middleton was 'so nervous' but now 'holds her head high'</h1>
      <h2>The Duchess officially opened The Nook - a new children's hospice in Norfolk - where she beamed and waved to flag-waving crowds</h2>

      <p>Kate Middleton has transformed from a "nervous" patron to walking with her "head held high", says a charity boss.</p>
      <p>Today, the Duchess officially opened The Nook - a new children's hospice in Norfolk.</p>
      <p>CEO Graham Butland looked back at his first memories of Kate as a royal charity patron - saying she was "so nervous" as she stepped out in front of crowds.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://people.com/royals/kate-middletons-special-touch-with-children-in-hospice-that-is-her-character/">People</a> : "In the very early days, I remember her coming into a room and her head would be slightly down and the long hair would be across.</p>
      <p>"Now, she comes in with her head held high."</p>

      <p>Mr Butland added that Kate had "comfortably grown into her royal position' and has a natural ability to connect with people.</p>
      <p>He said: "This is not someone struggling to stay in character. That is her character."</p>
      <p>Kate's touching visit today saw her meet with little Stanley Harrold outside the hospice, he’s three and has a rare chromosomal disorder, Pallister-Killian syndrome.</p>
      <p>She spoke to Stanley's parents and stroked the little boy's black teddy bear, tucked into his blanket.</p>
      <p>The Duchess was invited on a tour of the new hospice's facilities, including a hydrotherapy pool, state-of-the-art sensory room and music studio.</p>

      <p>After a five-year public appeal to raise £10million and almost two years of building, East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices group welcomed the first child to receive care at The Nook on Monday, September 30.</p>
      <p>EACH cares for children and young people with life-threatening condition cross Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk and supports their families.</p>
      <p>Their care service includes specialist nursing care, symptom management nursing, short breaks, wellbeing activities, therapies, counselling and volunteer services in the family home; all meeting the individual needs of the child, young person and whole family.</p>

      <p>Kate wore an Oscar de la Renta suit paired with black heels - the same striking fuchsia outfit she previously wore a Health Writers conference in 2017 and then again this January for a Royal Opera House.</p>
      <p>Inside the Kate told one little girl: "I love your plaits. My little girl Charlotte loves plaits but her hair’s only this long so we have to do them at the top."</p>
      <p>Later Kate is set to unveil a plaque to formally open the purpose-built hospice in Framingham Earl, around five miles south of Norwich.</p>
