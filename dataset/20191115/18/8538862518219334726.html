      <h1>Rumour: New Mass Effect Game in Early Development at BioWare</h1>
      <h2>Massive effect</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/ShogunRok" target="_blank">Robert Ramsey</a></address>
      <p>We know for sure that BioWare is currently working on the next Dragon Age -- commonly referred to as <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/dragon_age_4">Dragon Age 4</a> -- but according to a lengthy report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">Jason Schreier on Kotaku</a>, that's not all BioWare has in the oven. Alongside what sounds like it could be <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/rumour_anthem_reportedly_not_dead_as_bioware_plans_major_overhauls">a significant overhaul</a> of the ill-fated <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/anthem">ANTHEM</a>, the Canadian developer apparently has a new Mass Effect title in the early stages of development at its Edmonton base.</p>
      <p>The article doesn't go into any real detail on the subject, but it does state that the project is supposedly being headed by studio veteran Mike Gamble. Gamble was a lead producer on both ANTHEM and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/mass_effect_andromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>. Before that, he was a producer on Mass Effect 3 and its DLC, and a project manager on Mass Effect 2.</p>
      <p>If accurate, this leak comes as no huge surprise. Back at E3 last year, BioWare said that <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2018/06/e3_2018_bioware_intends_to_return_to_mass_effect_in_the_future">it would like return to Mass Effect</a> at some point, and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2018/08/bioware_teases_secret_mass_effect_and_dragon_age_stuff">it then teased "secret" Mass Effect projects</a> a month later. In the meantime, why not release a <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/bioware_asks_what_mass_effect_fans_want_on_n7_day_as_if_we_havent_spent_the_last_6_years_begging_for_a_trilogy_remaster">remastered Mass Effect Trilogy</a>? It's not like we've spent the entire generation asking for it or anything...</p>
      <p>Do you have any hope for a new Mass Effect game? Pray to Commander Shepard in the comments section below.</p>
