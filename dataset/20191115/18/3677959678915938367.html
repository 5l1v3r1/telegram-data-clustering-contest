      <p>Infinity Ward has just rolled out a new Call of Duty Modern Warfare PC update that addresses the stuttering issues during cutscenes alongside a fix for dev error 6178.</p>
      <p>Yesterday we <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-modern-warfare-patch-1-09/">reported on the upcoming Modern Warfare 1.09 patch</a> that will focus on fixing officer progression and challenge bugs. Today, Infinity Ward has rolled out a PC-only update that fixes the above-mentioned issues alongside overall stability improvements.</p>
