      <h1>Bank teller allegedly attempted to burglarize customer who made large withdrawal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:08:45+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/david_pescovitz" target="_blank">David Pescovitz</a></address>
      <p>On Monday, a 78-year-old man in Harford County, Maryland, withdrew a large sum of cash from his bank. That night, an intruder forced his way into the man's house and assaulted him until a relative interrupted the beating. As the relative called the cops the intruder ran off. Police later identified the culprit as 19-year-old Nathan Michael Newell, a teller at the victim's bank.</p>
      <p>Newell is currently in the county jail. He was also fired, probably for lousy customer service.</p>
      <p>"We are shocked and appalled to hear of the events that led to the assault and injury of a longtime member of our credit union," (Freedom Federal Credit Union president Michael) MacPherson said. "Our thoughts go out to him, and his family, during this difficult time."</p>
