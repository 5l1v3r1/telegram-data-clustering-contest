      <p>A ward boy named Yogesh, 28, employed on a contract basis with Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), allegedly killed himself at his Chamarajpet residence on Friday. As word spread, several ward boys working with KIMS staged a protest alleging that Yogesh had killed himself over non-payment of salary for several months.</p>
      <p>Police sources said that Yogesh had not been paid since January 2019. However, they said he had not left a note and they couldn’t ascertain whether it was salary issues that led him to take the extreme step.</p>
      <p>The ward boys withdrew their protest in the evening after the KIMS management promised to address their issues at a meeting on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>However, the management claimed they were not responsible for Yogesh’s death.</p>
