      <h1>Steve Clarke tells Scotland to build on positivity in quest for third place and play-offs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:22:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/roddy-forsyth/" target="_blank">Roddy Forsyth</a></address>
      <p>It is a measure of Steve Clarke’s credibility that when he says he sees an improvement in Scotland’s performances, the reaction is not a tsunami of scorn, such as greeted Donald Trump’s claim that his daughter created 14 million jobs in the US economy. Clarke’s standing largely derives from the incontestable transformation he effected at Kilmarnock before he became the popular choice to succeed Alex McLeish after the Scots’ opening two games in the Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>That said, the manager knows that he is at the limit of the overdraft of goodwill extended to him by the Tartan Army, whose most optimistic members have followed the side to Nicosia, where they will meet Cyprus on Saturday. Clarke’s record currently stands at two wins and four losses from six qualifiers in Group I, the pair of successes being <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/06/08/oliver-burke-rescues-scotland-keep-euro-2020-hopes-alive-steve/">a 2-1 victory at home over the Cypriots in his first game in charge</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/13/john-mcginn-bags-hat-trick-scotland-hit-san-marino-six-hampden/">a 6-0 drubbing of San Marino</a>, who are the bottom feeders of international football, along with Bhutan.</p>
      <p>Clarke inherited a campaign that had begun badly with a 3-0 defeat by Kazakhstan - rated 117th in the world rankings when they administered humiliation in Nursultan – but even had the Scots won that match, they would still be an irrecoverable nine points behind second-placed Russia. For the manager’s perception of betterment to be endorsed by the fans, the group schedule has to finish with another victory over Cyprus and a squaring of the account with the Kazakhs at Hampden next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“I think you're always judged,” said Clarke. “That’s the job of the head coach of the national team - to be judged. I didn’t see any favourable comments when we were losing the games against Belgium and Russia.</p>
      <p>“I think within the group, things are getting better but until we start winning matches on the pitch no one is going to see that.”</p>
      <p>Even these modest ambitions have been undermined by the absence of Scotland’s two best players, Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson. In Tierney’s case, club prevailed over country, with Unai Emery asking for the defender not to be included in Clarke’s squad - because of an unspecified ‘ongoing issue’ – before fielding him in Arsenal’s 1-1 Europa League draw with Vitoria in Portugal.</p>

      <p>Other absentees include Liam Cooper, Ryan Fraser, Grant Hanley and Scott McTominay, but Clarke needs to mine these fixtures for seams of optimism with the Nations League play-offs in mind. Those spring contests still offer Scotland a chance to make it to the Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>“We spoke after the San Marino game about trying to build on that little bit of positivity," Clarke said. "So, coming in to these games is about trying to continue that.</p>
      <p>“Cyprus are a difficult team to play here and Kazakhstan at home will be a difficult opponent, but they are two games that we feel we have to perform well in and try to take momentum in to March.</p>
      <p>“We have a definite target within the group to finish in third position and we have a definite target in March when we have the qualifying games for that second opportunity to get to Euro 2020.”</p>
      <p>If Steven Naismith plays, the Hearts forward will win his 50th cap, a distinction that has been on hold for more than a year, during which time he moved on loan to Tynecastle and then made the move permanent after rejecting chances to play abroad, but he suffered a hamstring injury and was out of action for three months.   "It was part of my decision,” Naismith said. “If I was to go abroad and choose one of the offers further afield then that would have probably suggested I would not earn more caps, but I didn’t want to give up on that.</p>
      <p>“It would be great. I've been on 49 for a while now, so I’ve had time to think what it would mean but, throughout my Scotland career, I have felt grateful rather than having the expectation of getting there.”</p>
      <p>With Robertson and Tierney unavailable and Charlie Mulgrew not included in the original squad because of injury, Clarke needs to find another captain for this match, but he was guarded about the identity of the stand-in choice.  “Everybody in the dressing room should be a leader, everyone should try and take on part of the role of captain,” he said.</p>
      <p>"It’s not something that should just be down to one person. You want as many leaders and positive people in the camp as you can get and that's what we are trying to build here.</p>
      <p> “I’m not going to give out the team today so you will find out tomorrow.”</p>
