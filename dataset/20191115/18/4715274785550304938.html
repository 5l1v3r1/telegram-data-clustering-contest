      <p>The new line addresses the very real issue of sky-high electricity prices (the Philippines ranks a lowly 92nd in the global competitiveness report of the World Economic Forum in terms of electricity costs), and utilizes innovative technology to help bring down power costs for a myriad of customer segments</p>
      <p>LG’s line up, perfect for restaurants, small and medium-sized stores and offices, as well as homes, include the floor standing, ceiling mounted cassette, one-way ceiling cassette, ceiling suspended, and ceiling concealed duct. The products are rigged with LG’s revolutionary R1 compressor and smart inverter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Electricity bills plunge 25% lower</b>
      </p>
      <p>With its innovative technology, the R1 compressor resolves the problem of  low efficiency in the widely used rotary compressor ACs, and improves the tiling motion of scroll. It also lowers the noise to 4dB, and reduces its weight by 20%.</p>
      <p>The LG smart inverter reduces the annual price of electricity bills by 25% compared to an on/off model. </p>
      <p> It also  enables air flow to cool a long distance: the floor standing unit can reach up to 20 meters.</p>
      <p>A five-step air cleaning feature reduces maintenance costs and makes upkeep simple and fuss-free. In terms of performance, it has a wide operation range as low as -15°C and as high as 48°C outdoor temperature.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cassettes to die for</b>
      </p>
      <p>LG also introduced the dual vane cassette, an upgraded version of the four-way ceiling cassette and  round cassettes  which is equipped with an innovative dual vane technology. </p>
      <p>The dual vane cassette, with its  eight vanes, manages air flow more precisely and provides optimized air flow for users, using six different modes, including three patented ones. </p>
      <p>The round cassette provides three-way air flow, is equipped with crystal vanes, enabling the user to control the direction in six steps. Moreover, the 3D fan increases air flow rate by 5% while lowering noise. With a larger air flow rate, cooling rate becomes 30% faster.</p>
      <p>“LG’s HVAC Division will continue to develop the world’s best HVAC for contributing to conserve the environment as well as creating better living conditions for everyone,” said Inkwun Heo, managing director of LG electronics Philippines. </p>
