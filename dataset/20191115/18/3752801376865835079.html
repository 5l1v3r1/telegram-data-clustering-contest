      <p>Mozambique's largest opposition party Renamo has lost its bid to annul last month's election results after the country's top court threw out its challenge, according to a court judgement seen on Friday.</p>
      <p>Renamo, the rebel group turned opposition party, lodged an application after it lost the October 15 election to the long-ruling Frelimo party.</p>
      <p>It accused the government of "massive electoral fraud" and of using violence and intimidation on voting day in a breach of a peace deal between the two parties who once fought a civil war.</p>
      <p>But the Constitutional Court, in a judgement dated November 11 but seen on its website on Friday, rejected the application on grounds that the party "did not submit enough evidence to sustain it's complaint".</p>
      <p>Last week the European Union cast doubt on the credibility of the ruling party's victory, saying its observers detected a litany of "irregularities and malpractices" and called on authorities to clarify them.</p>
      <p>Mozambican civil society and international observers had already flagged numerous alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes and chase away election monitors, as well as hundreds of thousands of so-called "ghost voters" on the electoral roll.</p>
      <p>Incumbent President Filipe Nyusi won a new five-year term after his Frelimo party secured 73% of the votes cast.</p>
      <p>The election posed a major challenge to the country's already fragile peace agreement between Frelimo and Renamo who fought a civil war from 1975-1992 that left one million dead.</p>
