      <p>A training helicopter belonging to the Nigerian Air Force has crashed in the NAF Base in Enugu State after returning from a routine training exercise.</p>
      <p>According to NAF twitter account on Friday in Enugu State, the crash occurred on Thursday after a routine training.</p>
      <p>It said that although there were casualties, the cause of the incident was still sketchy and unknown.</p>
      <p>@NigAirForce twitter that was re-twitted by Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola‏, reads; “NAF helicopter suffers mishap upon landing in Enugu.</p>
      <p>“Helicopter has crashed on landing in Enugu after a routine flight today. Fortunately, there were no fatalities or injuries to any crewmember or persons on the ground.</p>
      <p>“@CAS_AMSadique has directed that a Board of Inquiry be constituted to determine the causes of the accident.</p>
      <p>“@NigAirForce continues to solicit the understanding and support of the general public as it daily strives to ensure the security of Nigeria and Nigerians. Details later’’.</p>
      <p>The <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that efforts to get NAF officials on the ground at the NAF Ground Training Command, Enugu State, to speak on the incident were not successful.</p>
      <p>Those that responded to calls, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that it was only NAF Headquarters that can authoritatively speak on the matter.</p>
