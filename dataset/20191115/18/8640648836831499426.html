      <p>RENO — A man suspected in a fatal shooting last month was dressed as the Joker from the recently released movie and identified himself to police as the main character in the film, Arthur Fleck, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Juan Hernandez, 25, was arrested on murder charges Oct. 27 in the death of Luis Torres-Mederos during an annual Halloween Zombie Crawl in downtown Reno, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported Thursday.</p>
      <p>Authorities do not know the motive and do not know if Hernandez was inspired by the movie, Reno police officers said.</p>
      <p>Video surveillance depicts Hernandez fumbling with a gun in a crowd before turning and shooting Torres-Mederos, 22, twice in the head, Deputy District Attorney Michael Bolenbaker said.</p>
      <p>Hernandez was intoxicated when he was taken into custody, authorities said. Police are waiting for a toxicology report to determine if there were drugs in his system.</p>
      <p>Public defender Katheryn Hickman said at a bail hearing last week that family and friends described the shooting as out of character for Hernandez.</p>
      <p>“Everybody is extremely surprised,” Hickman said. Hernandez was a “scientist at a local hospital” and was a stand-up citizen who “paid his bills on time.”</p>
      <p>The Fleck character in the “Joker” was played by Joaquin Phoenix and tailspins down a violent path. The movie drew criticism before it ever opened.</p>
      <p>Hernandez is being held in Washoe County Jail on charges of open murder and battery with use of a deadly weapon. His bail is set at $500,000 cash.</p>
