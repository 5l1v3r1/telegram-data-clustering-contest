      <p>Imitation might be the sincerest form of flattery but it screams all a little too familiar for Rayne Bryant.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the former WAG turned social media influencer discovered several of her Instagram pictures were ripped from her account to set up a fake Tinder profile under the name “Lucy”.</p>
      <p>But the attempted romance fraud was not the first time someone has wanted to fill the shoes of her seemingly glamorous life. When she was married to West Coast Eagle Andrew Embley a decade ago, she unwittingly became part of an elaborate catfishing scheme.</p>
      <p>A woman she had never met targeted her acquaintances on Facebook to gain information about her life, setting up a fake RSVP dating profile in her name and luring in at least four men into fake relationships.</p>

      <p>A handful of these “relationships” went for as long as five months, with the men believing they were having an affair with Rayne — until finally growing suspicious and attempting to make contact with her.</p>
      <p>One victim even set up a room in his Byron Bay house for Bryant’s now eight-year-old son Lux, whom she was pregnant with at the time.</p>
      <p>The Embleys got the police involved and discovered who it was, but weren’t even able to take out a restraining order on her.</p>

      <p>“Unless they threaten you or try to access your bank accounts there’s really not much they can do,” she said. “It was quite scary because I was happily married and I’ve got these guys thinking that I’m leaving my husband and my children.”</p>
      <p>Ms Bryant, 36, said she met one victim and listened to a phone conversation the victim had recorded.</p>
      <p>“She had done her research. When I listened to the phone conversation about my cousins, my sisters, the events that I had on and things like that,” she said.</p>
      <p>This time around, Ms Bryant said she simply feels sad for the person trying to impersonate her. “I just feel sorry for these girls who don’t feel like they can be themselves, or maybe it’s a guy I don’t know,” she said.</p>
