      <p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> have hired Ben Cherington as the team's new general manager, according to multiple reports.</p>
      <p>Cherington served as GM of the <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox">Boston Red Sox</a> for four years, winning the World Series in 2013.</p>
      <p>He stepped down as the Red Sox's general manager during the 2015 season after Dave Dombrowski was named Boston's new president of baseball operations.</p>
      <p>In Sept. 2016, Cherington was hired by the <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> to be their vice president of baseball operations.</p>
      <p>He takes over in Pittsburgh for executive vice president and general manager Neal Huntington, who was fired after a 12-year stint.</p>
      <p>Since late September the Pirates have fired Huntington, manager Clint Hurdle and team president Frank Coonelly.</p>
      <p>Travis Williams has been hired to replace Coonelly while the managerial position remains open.</p>
