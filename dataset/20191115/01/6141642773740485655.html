      <p>New Zealand paceman Lockie Ferguson is confident he can cause “a little bit of anxiety” in England’s batsman if he is given his Test debut in Mount Maunganui next week.</p>
      <p>Ferguson has been drafted into New Zealand’s Test squad for the first time on the back of a standout 2019 in which he was one of the fastest bowlers on show at the World Cup, and where he was the second highest wicket-taker.</p>
      <p>While the tourists will be able to call on Jofra Archer, Ferguson will unquestionably add a similar edge to New Zealand’s attack if he can oust one of the established trio of Trent Boult, Tim Southee or Neil Wagner.</p>

      <p>Ferguson said: “Part of my role in the team is to bring a little bit of anxiety, potentially, from bowling extra speed. England have some quick bowlers too with Jofra Archer, it does the same thing to both teams.</p>
      <p>“I think that’s probably the most exciting part about Test cricket is that there’s no limited overs so you know you’re probably going to face them at some point in time.</p>
      <p>“Fast bowlers are going to create a threat and cause problems just from pure pace but at the same time you have to be accurate.</p>
      <p>“That’s one thing I’ve worked on a long time was bowling quick but making sure I was putting it where I wanted to put it. Although bowling quick is nice sometimes you can get hit even further.”</p>

      <p>Ferguson, whose 21 wickets at an average of 19.47 at the World Cup placed him behind only Australia left-arm quick Mitchell Starc, is not taking his Test place for granted.</p>
      <p>But with Test series to come against Australia and India after England return home, Ferguson hopes he will get a chance to complete his set – having been capped in 36 one-dayers and eight Twenty20s – over the next few months.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m pretty excited to be part of the Test squad, it’s a goal I’ve been working to for a long time as I really enjoy red-ball cricket.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got three internationally-recognised world-class bowlers who have been doing an exceptional job for us and put us at number two in the Test rankings.</p>

      <p>“It’s nice to rub shoulders with them. It’s going to be a tough team to break into but there’s a lot of Test cricket coming up.”</p>
      <p>Asked about the challenges and differences between Tests and limited-overs, Ferguson added: “You can’t always go 100 per cent that you potentially can in one-day and T20, you have to pick and choose when to bowl quick spells.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely going to be a new challenge. Fortunately I’ve played quite a lot against (England’s) players before at international level so it’s not completely new, but red ball is a different beast.”</p>
