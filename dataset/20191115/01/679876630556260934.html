      <h1>Greek islands's new boutique luxury hotel, Mykonos Riviera Hotel &amp; Spa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:52:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.traveller.com.au/belinda-jackson-hvf4w" target="_blank">Belinda Jackson</a></address>
      <p>The glamorous Greek islands never fail to dazzle, and with its sparkling white Cycladic houses against a backdrop of turquoise waters, Mykonos is amongst its best-loved.  </p>
      <p>Set in Tourlos Marina, it's only fitting the Mykonos Riviera Hotel &amp; Spa has a nautical theme. Infinity pools merge into the blue skies and even bluer waters, and its 11 new room types range from one-bedroom to three-bedroom pool suites and maisonettes, with their backs to the cliffs and faces turned to the Aegean Sea for optimal sunset viewing. </p>
      <p>Expect the minimalist, beachy white palette to continue inside: choose an ocean-facing retreat room – step it up with a hot tub on the terrace - or opt for the new courtyard view retreats, which include a sunny, sheltered patio for dining.</p>

      <p>Nip down for a dip at the beach in Agios Stefanos, take an easy stroll to Hora (Mykonos Town), or stay onsite to test-drive the hotel's spa and two restaurants.</p>
      <p>For a classic arrival on the island, the slow ferry from Athens' port, Piraeus takes about five hours, while the time-poor can touch down on Mykonos' own international airport, a 40-minute flight from Athens.</p>
      <p>The tourist season in Mykonos runs from April until end October, peaking in the European school holidays, July-August, and in keeping with Greece's strict dictums about when it's officially summer, the hotel opens in 2020 from May 10 until October 10 only.  A member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World, rooms start from E330 a night – book early to grab significant discounts.
