      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bh90210-second-season-canceled">Reboots</a> are all the rage on television these days, and country star <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/reba-mcentire">Reba McEntire</a> is ready to jump on board.</p>
      <p>The aptly titled "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">Reba</a>" aired from 2001-2007 and starred the singer as a single mother of three. The role earned McEntire, now 64, a Golden Globe nomination.</p>

      <p>"We're always ready for a reunion," McEntire <a href="https://www.etonline.com/reba-mcentire-says-shes-always-ready-for-a-reba-reunion-exclusive-136350">told "Entertainment Tonight</a>" at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/cma-awards">CMA Awards</a> on Wednesday night. "We would love that. (All it takes is) somebody saying yes. The powers that be. I think we'd all love it -- JoAnna Garcia, Chris Rich, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/punchline-host-reba-alum-melissa-peterman-says-reba-mcentire-is-wicked-funny-and-hardcore-at-backgammon">Melissa Peterman</a>, Steve Howey, myself, I think we'd love it."</p>
      <p>Even though it's been 12 years since they all worked together on "Reba," the cast members still seem close as ever, with Peterman, who played Barbra Jan, recently posting a video on Instagram of her and McEntire hanging out.</p>

      <p>In the video, Peterman, 48, mouthed the words as McEntire sang "Escape (The Pina Colada Song)" on a beach, serenading Peterman's tropical drink.</p>
