      <p>Entering the new Goop store in Pacific Heights is like entering the home of that rich friend you envy.</p>
      <p>“When you enter the shop, we want it to feel like walking into the Northern California home of that friend whose style is restrained, modern, and a touch European — a home you secretly want to copy,” said Jessica Kamel of Ronen Lev, the company that designed the store.</p>
      <p>But, it’s also not that different from entering any other high-end boutique stuffed with luxury items you touch and wonder, who-the-hell actually buys this? Under abundant natural light, the clothing is amply spaced out, the gold-rimmed mirrors have aspirational phrases on them and the thick price tags are carefully tucked out-of-view.</p>
      <p>While I expected to find numerous “wellness” products claiming to heal every ailment a body or mind could have, and plenty of skincare products I couldn’t afford, what I didn’t expect to find was body-shaming in the racks of clothing. There was not one piece of women’s clothing on the floor that I could find larger than a size six. And those size six pants seemed like they were left out on accident since it was the only one I could find. Almost every item of clothing I looked at was represented only in a size extra-small, small or equivalent (00 or 0 for dresses, 24 or 25 for pants).</p>
      <p>It’s possible the store had larger sizes in the back, but they weren’t on display. This means any customer who wears larger sizes and plans to shop at Goop on Fillmore Street will have to flag down a salesperson to uncomfortably ask if they could fetch them each item.</p>
      <p>Prices for said clothing were exorbitant, but not unexpected or out of character for Fillmore Street. Dresses cresting the $1,000 mark and chunky knits for $400 are quite average in this part of town. The only pieces of clothing that retailed for less than $100 were basics like Goop-brand white cotton sleeping shorts or a simple ribbed tank top from another brand.</p>
      <p>But, if you’re shopping at Goop with any prior knowledge, you know items under $100 aren’t what Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand is known for. Which is probably why they have a specific section of the store (just a shelf, actually) titled “under $100,” which was mainly a collection of items for the home bar, like jiggers and ice cube molds.</p>
      <p>If you’re familiar with Goop, you may do what I did first, which is to go in search of the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/SF-gynecologist-warns-women-not-to-use-the-jade-10872323.php&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573776813552000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEE2jVmXUz_uDSBXKx00pOZh8PysQ">controversial jade egg</a> that the brand once said could fix your hormone levels and help with bladder control. After a debate about the health claims of the product and a subsequent lawsuit, the eggs are (likely) purposefully, quite literally, in the back corner of the store. The two eggs, one in jade and one in rose quartz, were simply displayed, each gleaming in a small gold dish. There was no branding, no price and no information about the product at all. Just mystique sold in a plain brown box with a “G” on it.</p>
      <p>While the eggs could go almost unnoticed, three bottles of spray just beneath them may be the most perplexing items you encounter in the store. Also in the “sexual wellness” corner, you can purchase “Psychic Vampire Repellent” to “conjure up positivity” or “Chill Child Kid Calming Mist” to “reign in your little ball of energy” from Paper Crane Apothecary.</p>
      <p>“We always try and stock stuff that you wouldn’t find elsewhere so it feels really unique,” Noora Raj Brown, SVP of Communications, said. “We pride ourselves on having a lot of small purveyors, so a lot of things that are limited edition or custom.”</p>
      <p>Spraying a calming mist around your kids is a little too reminiscent of spraying water on your cat when it’s jumped on the kitchen counter, for me.</p>
      <p>Brown also said that each store strives to cater to the local market, even stocking some items from local artisans. For now, the only nods to the Bay Area came in the form of the Zuni Cafe and Chez Panisse cookbooks in the kitchen section.</p>
      <p>While the store has its flaws (OK, mostly the huge sizing inclusivity flaw), I’ll admit I wanted to buy plenty of items, too. The shelves featured many items that are just plain practical, from the reusable sandwich bags I already own, to adapters that make your Airpods work with in-flight entertainment on planes.</p>
      <p>Perhaps I’ve lived in San Francisco too long, but for every $75 bottle of olive oil claiming to make me “awake” or “alive,” there was also a foldable, reusable straw I’ve been debating buying for months. Those items probably aren’t exactly where G.P. is making her millions, but they are things a normal customer (me?) would have searched for on Amazon and now I know where to find them locally.</p>
      <p>And yes, staffers around the store exclusively referred to her as “G.P.,” evoking the moniker as if Paltrow was their good friend.</p>
      <p>While the elusive actress is unlikely to pop up at the shop anytime soon, the permanent store opens Nov. 15 to the public for all your jade egg needs.</p>
