      <h1>New program at CWES launching in honour of domestic homicide victims</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:56:49+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:56</time> by <a rel="author">Alanna Smith</a></address>
      <p>Jill Duncan felt like she had virtually no options to leave an abusive household.</p>
      <p>The Edmonton woman’s biggest fear was putting her dogs in danger while she faced the threat of homelessness and endured physical and mental illnesses.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until accessing a local shelter and learning of a provincial pet safekeeping program that she finally left with the confidence that her four-legged “reasons for living” would be safe while she forged a path to stability.</p>
      <p>“The Pet Safekeeping program was my saving grace,” Duncan said of the Alberta SPCA support. “These babies are my life. They are my reason for being and to have them treated poorly was enough to kill me in itself.</p>
      <p>“You don’t want to leave your home and leave your animals behind, especially with an abusive person because they will take it out on those animals. They absolutely will, just for the simple fact that you aren’t there to beat on and be emotionally abused, but the animals are.”</p>
      <p>The link between animal abuse and domestic violence is clear, according to experts, and is why a local shelter in Calgary is launching a program of its own to assist victims of domestic violence with pets.</p>
      <p>The Calgary Women’s Emergency Shelter will announce the new program Friday at a <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/charity-gala-to-honour-domestic-homicide-victims-jasmine-lovett-and-aliyah-sanderson">gala</a> honouring domestic homicide victims Jasmine Lovett and her toddler daughter, Aliyah Sanderson, who were <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/crime/double-murder-suspect-robert-leeming-makes-first-court-appearance/wcm/f6a8b8e0-59d8-4d2d-9667-7576c9f1301d">killed</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Kim Ruse, CWES executive director, said the program will transform two of the emergency shelter’s 15 rooms, with 50 beds total, into pet-friendly spaces to accommodate small animals that arrive with women fleeing violence. The program will be named after Lovett and Sanderson.</p>
      <p>Robert Leeming, Lovett’s former partner, is charged with two counts of second-degree murder in relation to their deaths. A preliminary hearing is set for Feb. 3, 2020.</p>
      <p>Divorce documents obtained by Postmedia show Leeming pleaded guilty to three animal cruelty charges in 2018. His ex-wife wrote in divorce documents that Leeming repeatedly threatened the couple’s dog and left it chained to a tree to die.</p>
      <p>In light of these charges, the CWES and Lovett family agreed the program would be a fitting way to honour the slain mother and her daughter.</p>

      <p>According to an Alberta SPCA report in 2012, 59 per cent of abused women were afraid to seek help out of concern for their animals, 36 per cent of abused women with animals said their abuser threatened or harmed their pets and 85 per cent of those threats were carried out.</p>
      <p>In cases that involve children and threatened animals, about 85 per cent of women reported that the children witnessed the threat or harm, and in half of those cases the pet belonged to the child, the report showed.</p>
      <p>“I always stress to everybody, and I feel like I’m a broken record, but when people are at risk or in crisis so are their companion animals and vice versa,” said Patricia Mamak, who oversees the Pet Safekeeping Program with the Alberta SPCA.</p>
      <p>“Even investigators who go to investigate animal cruelty, they are very rarely surprised to see there are other issues beneath the surface. I can’t even tell you how many times I have worked with women that have told me their family cat was abused or dog was drowned or the husband threatened to kill (the pets) if she left. It goes hand in hand,” said Mamak.</p>
      <p>The Pet Safekeeping Program, which launched in 2014, provides short-term housing for pets belonging to individuals who have fled abusive situations. The program also includes customized safety planning for victims, crisis intervention and referrals to supporting agencies.</p>
      <p>Mamak said they see at least 100 cases per year but witnessed a massive spike in service needs in 2018, with a 250 per cent increase in the amount of intakes compared to 2017.</p>
      <p>“It hasn’t been around for very long, but we have definitely seen how incredibly impactful it has been for people,” she said. “I could go on and on about how many times women have told me they would have never left if it wasn’t for us — ‘You saved my life, you saved my kid’s life.’ ”</p>
      <p>The Alberta SPCA services communities outside of city centres, whereas in Calgary there is a specialized program for pet safekeeping though the Calgary Humane Society.</p>
      <p>Ruse said CWES hopes to partner with other organizations in the community working with animals to ensure a collaborative approach.</p>
      <p>Funds raised from the With Her Gala at Mount Royal University on Friday will go toward the program.</p>

      <p>As for Duncan, she said the Alberta SPCA program changed her life.</p>
      <p>She has her own place now and her dogs are safe and sound.</p>
