      <h1>Marvel Gives Nebula Her First-Ever Comic Book Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:15:58+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:15</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>Back in 1985, Nebula debuted as an Avengers villain who claimed to be the grand daughter of Thanos. But thanks to her recent heroic turns in <b>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</b> and <b>Avengers: Infinity War</b> &amp; <b>Endgame</b>, Marvel is giving Nebula her first ever comic.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/nebula-gets-her-own-limited-series-in-february-2020">Marvel.com</a>, Vita Ayala and artist Claire Roe will be the creative team of <b>Nebula</b>. Jen Bartel will provide the cover art for the five-issue miniseries. While Nebula hasn’t quite had a face turn in the comics, she has been more sympathetically portrayed in the current <b>Guardians of the Galaxy</b> comic.</p>
      <p>According to Marvel, the story will put Nebula on a quest for “a very secret device.” And Nebula will be going up against some of “the galaxy’s most notorious bounty hunters.”</p>

      <p>Ayala spoke with <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8790243/nebula-marvel-comic-book-release-date-details">Refinery29</a> about her take on Nebula herself.</p>
      <p>“I think of her as someone who has been fundamentally traumatized and damaged, both physically and psychologically,” said Ayala. “One of the things I found really interesting about her was how she became kind of a cyborg; they went in and put robotic parts everywhere, including her brain. I wondered, What does that do to a person? Does that account for some of the really wild stuff that she gets up to later on? So the series has explosions and punching and shooting — it’s basically a space Western — but through all that stuff, I really want to show what trauma does to you, fundamentally as a person.”</p>
      <p><b>Nebula</b> #1 will hit comic stores in February 2020.</p>
