        <b>Benfica held on to top spot with a hard-fought win against Santa Clara, FC Porto overcame local rivals Boavista and Sporting followed up their Europa League success, against Rosenborg in Norway, with victory over Lisbon rivals Belenenses.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, league newcomers Famalicão conceded further ground in their ventures near the top, succumbing to a Moreirense comeback to draw 3-3. SC Braga won bragging rights in the Minho Derby with a 2-0 away win at V.Guimarães.</p>
      <p>Benfica have had a torrid time in the UEFA Champions League and the latest defeat at Lyon has left them bottom of Group G on three points from four games.</p>
      <p>The trip to the Azores saw the Primeira Liga leaders a goal down after eighteen minutes when Corvo headed home at the back post. Santa Clara maintained the upper hand either side of half-time before Vinicíus’ equaliser for Benfica in the second-half, tapping in a low-driven cross from Pizzi. The midfield provider turned goal scorer as he squeezed home Haris Seferovic’s pass twelve minutes from time to keep the Eagles in pole position.</p>
      <p>FC Porto, following their disappointing defeat in the Europa League against Glasgow Rangers, were determined to make amends in the local derby against Boavista even if they were without Mateus Uribe, Luís Diaz, Agustín Marchesín and the lesser-utilised Renzo Saravia. The quartet received in house suspensions for club infractions. Reliance fell on Alex Telles’ shoulders, with the full-back not disappointing when providing a shot from long range that was too hot for Rafael Bracali to handle to give Porto the lead. And that’s the way it stayed until the final whistle.</p>
      <p>The ever-impressive Famalicão were three goals to the good with only twenty-seven minutes remaining, but allowed Moreirense to snatch a point with a last gasp penalty from Steven Vitória after goals from Luís Machado and Pedro Nuno.</p>
      <p>Following a drab goalless first-half between Sporting and Belenenses it was left to the Lions ex-Atlético Madrid and Valencia striker Luciano Vietto to bag a couple of goals midway through the second period to move Sporting up to fourth place; still ten points below leaders Benfica.<br/>SC Portimonense chalked up their fourth 1-1 draw in five games as they took a point off Marítimo in Madeira. Lucas Fernandes goal keeps the Portimão outfit just one place above the drop zone.</p>
