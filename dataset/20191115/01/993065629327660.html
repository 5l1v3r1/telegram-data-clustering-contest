      <p>John McCartin, a QIH director and one of the five men told to resign or be killed during the torture of Kevin Lunney, only encountered Cyril McGuinness a couple of times.</p>
      <p>He was putting his bins out one evening in early 2015 when he heard the wheels of a car and looked up.</p>
      <p>There sitting in the passenger seat of a black Mercedes was a man he recognised from the front page of a Sunday newspaper as Cyril McGuinness, also known as Dublin Jimmy.</p>
      <p>The convicted criminal, who died suddenly when police raided a house in Derbyshire last week, is believed to be the "boss" rung by Kevin Lunney's abductors during his abduction.</p>

      <p>Beside Mr McGuinness, in the driving seat of the car, was a local man known to John McCartin.</p>
      <p>In the back seat was someone Mr McCartin recognised to be a notorious former IRA member.</p>

      <p>"I was chilled by it. I made eye contact and nodded to them. I thought they might pull down the window. but they didn't and drove off."</p>
      <p>Mr McCartin, who lives in Newtowngore in Co Leitrim, had in December 2014 been part of a team which had secured American private equity money to buy part of the former Quinn Group empire.</p>
      <p>The deal had been done with the blessing of the founder Sean Quinn who had lost the company in 2011 after a bad bet on Anglo Irish Bank shares.</p>
      <p>However, relations had become sour between the new QIH directors and Mr Quinn.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mr McCartin said it was one of two times he had seen Mr McGuinness.</p>
      <p>The first time was years before when Mr McCartin was playing traditional music in a pub in Ballyconnell in Co Cavan. Mr McGuinness repeatedly requested rebel songs which Mr McCartin was reluctant to play.</p>
      <p>"The bar man later said to me I was lucky I showed him disrespect and got away with it."</p>
