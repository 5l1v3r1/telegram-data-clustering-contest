      <p>THE Greenview Group has expanded into a new 5,000 sq ft office base in Newry.</p>
      <p>The company said the stand-alone premises at Carrickbracken Business Park will be capable of housing up to 30 staff, primarily for the firm's growing portfolio of heating and maintenance contracts. It includes servicing for 17,000 properties on behalf of the NI Housing Executive.</p>
      <p>The ten-year lease was announced by south Down property firm Bradley NI.</p>
      <p>Greenview commercial director Paul O'Hare said: “In seeking an office to facilitate our expansion plans, we considered locations including London and Dublin.</p>
      <p>“Newry gives us a primary central location to service all of Ireland and the UK. While Brexit has been a significant factor in this decision, we have committed to being located in Newry and we will manage any impact as and when we are required to.”</p>
      <p>Bradley NI's commercial director Garrett O'Hare said: “We are delighted to welcome Greenview Group to Carrickbrackan Business Park.</p>
      <p>“Greenview's investment in Newry at this time further emphasises Newry's unique position as a prime commercial hub and strategic gateway for business trading between Belfast and Dublin.”</p>
