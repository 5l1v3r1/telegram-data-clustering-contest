Excited about the film, Sidharth exclusively told ETimes, “My next release is ‘Shershaah’ which will come out next year. It's a biopic on Captain Vikram Batra who was a soldier who gave his life for our country during the Kargil war and I'm giving out his life story. For the first time I am playing a real life character. We have pretty much finished shooting and have only a few more days left.”</p>

      <p>The actor also revealed that it took a long time for him to get this biopic on board. “It's a special story, I've been trying to make this story for about two and a half-three years and you know finally I got Dharma Productions on board with Shabbir Boxwala, who has written the story. A lovely team has come together with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vishnu-Vardhan">Vishnu Vardhan</a> directing it, he is making his Hindi debut. So yeah, I'm pretty excited about that film and right after ‘Marjaavaan’ you will see it coming up next year.”</p>
      <p>Captain Vikram Batra has led several tough mountain warfare operations and lost his life in the battlefield. He was posthumously awarded with the Param Vir Chakra for his bravery during the 1999 Kargil war between India and Pakistan.</p>
