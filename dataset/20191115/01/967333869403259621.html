      <p>"We are currently striking Islamic Jihad terror targets in Gaza," the IDF <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1195113893342990337">tweeted</a>. "This comes after rockets were indiscriminately fired from Gaza at Israeli civilians today." In a previous <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1195078501575135233">tweet</a> two hours prior, they noted two rockets fired into southern Israel from Gaza were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defense system.</p>
      <p>Reports from <a href="https://twitter.com/MuhammadSmiry/status/1195112293417271298">inside</a> the Gaza Strip said Gaza city and Hattin, west of Khan Younis, had been hit by IDF attacks. Others <a href="https://twitter.com/elhamsadeq/status/1195118447170129921">reported</a> airstrikes near <a href="https://twitter.com/ShehabAgency/status/1195117133493161984">Rafah</a>, in the south of the territory.</p>
      <blockquote>Explosions and the roar of IAF jet engines, as well as the whine of drone motors, were recorded by observers in the early morning hours.</blockquote>

      <p>​The exchange of fire comes just hours after Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and the IDF reached a fragile truce, with IDF reporting rocket fire from Gaza hours after that. At least 34 Gazans have been killed by IDF airstrikes in recent days.</p>
