      <h1>HDI boards to enter new wave of growth in 5G, IoT era</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:18:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:18</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Liu, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Supply of HDI (high-density interconnect) boards has fallen short of demand in the second half of 2019, with Taiwan makers having to reschedule shipments to fulfill mounting orders. HDI boards, now mostly used in handsets, are expected to see a major rise in demand after entering the IoT era to support devices' miniaturization and performance upgrades.</p>
      <p>HDI tight supply in the second half of the year has mainly resulted from handset vendors adopting advanced anylayer-level HDI for enlarged mainboards and shipments of automotive-use HDI boards also picking up significantly. But the recent robust demand for HDI has yet to convince PCB makers, whether large or small, that they need to further expand capacity for the segment now, and hence the tight supply.</p>
      <p>PCB makers are usually quite conservative unless they have clear demand from clients. Major makers completed their first wave of capacity expansion two years ago to make early deployments, but demand since then had not been able to fill the makers' capacity untl recently.</p>
      <p>Statistics from Taiwan Printed Circuit Association (TPCA) show that the handset segment is the mainstream application outlet for HDI boards with a share of up to 75-80%, followed by 10% for other mobile devices and another 10% for automotive and aerospace products.</p>
      <p>Taiwan's leading PCB makers such as Zhen Ding Technology, Unimicron, Compeq Manufacturing, Triopod Technology, together with Austria's AT&amp;S and US-based TTM Technologies, have dominated global HDI supply thanks to their dominant presence in the handset market segment.</p>
      <p>Major presence by Taiwan makers</p>
      <p>TPCA tallies indicate that Taiwan's HDI production value reached US$4.01 billion (NT$122 billion) in 2018, commanding more than one third of the global total of US$10.1 billion for the year. Industry sources attributed TAiwan makers' impressive performance to their adopting, at the very beginning, high-price strategy and choosing to venture HDI products first into the consumer electronics sector which they have been most familiar with.</p>
      <p>The big players' dominance in the HDI market is expected to linger, as only they are technologically capable of manufacturing high-end anylayer HDI boards that are also increasingly needed for application to diverse mobile devices beyond handsets in the 5G era. Many new PCB makers in China are seeking to enter the HDI field, but their technology has stayed at the basic level.</p>
      <p>For second-tier PCB makers such as Unitech and Dynamic Electronis, the sources said, automotive electronics will be a niche application market they can tap more easily, including engine control, automatic parking and autonomous driving applications that require high performance computing systems.</p>
      <p>Vehicles will need more and more computing cores or small servers to support fast processing of big data collected from the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios, and HDI can serve the need.</p>
