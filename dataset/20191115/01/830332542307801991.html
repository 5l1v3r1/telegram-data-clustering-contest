      <p>(CNN) - A bank teller has been charged in connection with a home invasion at the residence of a customer who'd made a large withdrawal of money, authorities in Maryland said.</p>
      <p>A 78-year-old man told investigators he answered his door around 8:30 p.m. Monday and an unknown male forced his way inside, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HarfordCountySheriffsOffice/posts/10157548877122707">the Harford County Sheriff's Office said in a news release.</a> The intruder assaulted the man until a relative, a 57-year-old woman, intervened, the sheriff's office said.</p>
      <p>The suspect ran upstairs and the woman called police from a nearby home. When sheriff's deputies arrived, the intruder had fled and was not found during a neighborhood search with the K-9 unit, the sheriff's office said.</p>
      <p>"As the investigation continued, it was determined one of the victims had removed a large amount of money from the bank," the news release said. "Detectives gained information identifying a teller at the bank as the suspect."</p>
      <p>Nathan Michael Newell, 19, of Bel Air, was arrested Wednesday at the bank, the sheriff's office said.</p>
      <p>He has been charged with robbery, first- and third-degree burglary, first- and second-degree assault and home invasion, the news release said.</p>
      <p>Newell was being held at the county detention center without bond. The public defender's office said Thursday he will be assigned representation.</p>
      <p>Both residents suffered injuries. The woman was treated at the scene and the man was transported to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center with what are believed to be non-life-threatening injuries, the sheriff's office said.</p>
      <p>Michael MacPherson, president and CEO of Freedom Federal Credit Union, confirmed Newell was an employee of the credit union.</p>
      <p>Newell was fired, he said, adding vetting procedures while hiring Newell met all standards. Search of online databases showed he faced two traffic cases.</p>
      <p>"We are shocked and appalled to hear of the events that led to the assault and injury of a longtime member of our credit union," MacPherson said in a statement. "Our thoughts go out to him, and his family, during this difficult time."</p>
