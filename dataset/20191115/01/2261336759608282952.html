      <h1>LFA broadcast deal with UFC Fight Pass includes 46 scheduled events through 2021</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mookie Alexander</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/9/12/20861975/axs-tv-mma-anthem-sports-entertainment-news">When AXS TV was acquired by Anthem Sports</a>, it signaled the end of Legacy Fighting Alliance’s time on the network. LFA was forced to postpone two of its shows while they searched for a broadcast partner, and unsurprisingly they’ve landed on UFC Fight Pass.</p>
      <p>The agreement was announced during UFC 244 two weeks ago, but now the details on LFA’s partnership with Fight Pass have been revealed. Not only will the subscription service have rights to LFA’s next 46 shows, the entire fight library is part of the deal.</p>
      <p>From the official press release:</p>
      <blockquote>UFC FIGHT PASS®, the world’s leading digital subscription service for combat sports, and Legacy Fighting Alliance (LFA) today announced a multi-year streaming agreement in which UFC FIGHT PASS will serve as the exclusive global streaming provider for LFA events. The inaugural event under this deal, LFA 78, will take place on Friday, November 15, live from the Bell County Expo Center in Belton, Texas, at 9 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. PT.<br/><br/>Under the terms of the new agreement, UFC FIGHT PASS will live stream two remaining events in 2019, 20 events in 2020, and 24 events in 2021. In addition to live LFA events, subscribers of UFC FIGHT PASS will also have access to the entire LFA event library starting in 2020.</blockquote>
      <p>Legacy Fighting Alliance has been a hub for many current UFC fighters, including current champions Henry Cejudo, Kamaru Usman, and Valentina Shevchenko, top contenders like Brian Ortega and Dominick Reyes, as well as women’s prospects such as Mackenzie Dern, Sabina Mazo, and Maycee Barber.</p>
      <p>While we’re on the subject of broadcast deals, AXS TV is staying in the MMA business, as they recently announced that they’ll be the new English-language home <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/6/20952188/axs-tv-and-combate-americas-announce-broadcast-deal-for-35-events-in-2020">for Combate Americas starting in 2020</a>. That arrangement calls for at least 35 shows next year, to be aired in the old Friday night spot that LFA (and other regional MMA promotions) used to occupy.</p>
