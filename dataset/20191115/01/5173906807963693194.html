        <b>Portugal’s PSP police force has warned of an increase in occurrences related to scams through the MB Way banking app, having registered between January and May 135 complaints.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The PSP alert was published on Facebook, in which it warns of an increase of this type of scams as well as recommendations.</p>
      <p>According to data from PSP, in 2018 there were 99 occurrences recorded related to scams through the MB Way app and between 1 January and 31 May there were 135.</p>
      <p>The police said that, according to the investigation and analysis of the Criminal Investigation Department of the PSP, the ‘modus operandi’ aims to take advantage of the ads that victims put online for the sale of objects on sites dedicated to this type of trade (OLX, CustoJusto, among others).</p>
      <p>“Later, they are contacted by telephone by supposed buyers who show interest in that purchase,” the PSP said.</p>
      <p>Following this contact, the alleged buyers convince the victims to go to an ATM to pay for the item via MB WAY.</p>
      <p>“When they manage to deceive the victim, they take advantage of their lack of knowledge about the MB WAY app and, through misleading indications about the procedures to be adopted, they can access the victim’s bank account and make several withdrawals and purchases illegitimately,” they said.</p>
      <p>According to the PSP, the victim is thus led to entering into the ATM the suspect’s mobile phone number and the provision of the respective code, associating it with his or her ATM card, convinced that these are the proper procedures to receive payment through the MB WAY, eventually falling into the trap.</p>
      <p>According to the authorities, the victim thus gives access to the account that is linked with the ATM card, thus allowing undue withdrawals from the bank account.</p>
      <p>In this sense, the PSP recommend that they refuse to pay through the MB Way app if they do not understand how it works.</p>
      <p>It also recommended that people always try to do business in person if they are in the same geographical area as the buyer, receive payments in person or through bank transfer and never follow instructions from strangers to make the payments.</p>
      <p>Finally, the PSP stressed that in case of doubt, the information should be requested from the bank about the operation of the app.</p>
