      <p>Not too long ago, Capcom announced that <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Mega+Man">Mega Man</a> Zero/ZX Legacy Collection would be coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Nintendo+Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> and PC on January 21st, 2020. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. Capcom has decided to delay Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection to February 25th, 2020. According to Mega Man series producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, “it wasn’t a decision we made lightly”. Nevertheless, Tsuchiya also said that “the team behind Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection is working hard to deliver the best experience possible, and wants to bring you a product that will live up to your expectations”.</p>
