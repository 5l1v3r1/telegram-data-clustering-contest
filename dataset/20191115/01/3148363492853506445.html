      <p>On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” former Trump administration U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley was quizzed by host Wolf Blitzer about the sanctity of whistleblower laws.</p>
      <p>Blitzer asked, “Do you agree with the president that the whistleblower should be named and identified?”</p>
      <p>Haley said, “I mean, I believe in whistleblower laws. I think you have to protect a whistleblower, and then I think in turn they have to abide by those laws — the fact they don’t allow any sort of partisan leaking or anything like that to happen. We don’t know that’s happened either, but until then, I do think we should always protect the whistleblower.”</p>
      <p>Blitzer said, “So on this issue, you disagree with the president.”</p>
      <p>Haley said, “You can call it disagreeing. I think whistleblowers should be protected.”</p>
      <p>Blitzer said, “He wants the whistleblower to be named.”</p>
      <p>Haley said, “I understand, yep.”</p>
      <p>Blitzer asked, “In this area, you believe in the law, to protect the whistleblower?”</p>
      <p>Haley replied, “I do. I do believe in the law.”</p>
