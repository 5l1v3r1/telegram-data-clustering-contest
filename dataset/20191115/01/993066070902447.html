      <p>BACK IN THE DAY</p>
      <p>November 15 2009: AIB Ulster Club SFC semi-final: St Gall’s (Antrim) 2-15 Clontibret O’Neill’s (Monaghan) 0-11</p>
      <p>The Ulster Club Championship is rarely synonymous with champagne football but this display by St Gall’s was an exception.</p>
      <p>The Antrim champions racked up a staggering 2-12 from play.</p>
      <p>St Gall’s were quite simply sensational, although the 10-point margin of victory doesn’t tell the whole story of this game.</p>
      <p>Strange as it may sound, but there was a period in the first half when the boys in blue were hanging on by their finger tips.</p>
      <p>Clontibret could have been out of sight in the first quarter as the inspired Conor McManus ripped the St Gall’s full-back line to shreds.</p>
      <p>Then St Gall’s stepped it up, Rory Gallagher repeatedly used as the outlet on the 40-metre line.</p>
      <p>Although Gallagher finished the game with 2-2 from play, it was his exhibition of precision passing which provided the catalyst for his side’s comeback.</p>
      <p>Often faced with a screen of Saffron jerseys, Gallagher repeatedly picked the Clontibret lock with a dazzling array of pinpoint kicks.</p>
      <p>St Gall’s: Ronan Gallagher; M Kelly, A McClean, C Brady (capt); P Veronica, A Healy, S Kelly (0-1); S Burke, A Gallagher; Kieran McGourty (0-3), Kevin McGourty (0-1) T O’Neill (0-1); Kevin Niblock (0-2), Rory Gallagher (2-3, 0-1 free), CJ McGourty (0-3, 0-2 frees).</p>
      <p>Subs: K Stewart (0-1) for A McClean (15); D O’Hare for Kevin McGourty (51); S Burns for R Gallagher (58); M McGowan forAGallagher (58); S Kennedy for C Brady (58).</p>
      <p>Yellow card: Kevin McGourty (46). Clontibret: P McElroy; C Duffy, C Greenan, E Greenan; D Mooney, D Mone, M Corey; V Corey (capt), J Golden; B Og Magennis, P McGuigan, A Rooney (0-1); F Mone (0-1), C McManus (0-9, 0-2 frees), R Gorman.</p>
      <p>Subs: JP Mone for C Greenan (h-t); M Hughes for B Og Magennis (44); D McKeown for P McGuigan (47).</p>
      <p>Yellow cards: M Corey (20); J Golden (42); E Greenan (44); C McManus (54).</p>
