      <p>A WESTMINSTER election candidate has called for people to consider boycotting the Northern Ireland brand of Tayto crisps.</p>
      <p>Alliance councillor Patrick Brown made the plea after <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/2019/09/19/news/trader-in-court-for-selling-southern-tayto-to-shops-and-pubs-in-northern-ireland-1716216/">meeting a sole trader brought to court for selling the Republic's same-name brand north of the border</a>.</p>
      <p>Mark Ferris (48), from Ballynahinch in Co Down, <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/09/20/news/-i-feel-victimised-says-man-brought-to-court-for-selling-southern-tayto-1717092/">said he felt "victimised"</a> after Tayto NI issued trademark infringement proceedings against him.</p>
      <p>He said southern Tayto is widely available in the north and it was "grossly unfair" he was targeted rather than larger businesses.</p>

      <p>Mr Brown, Alliance's election candidate for South Down, posed for pictures with the businessman holding a poster which read: "Free the Tayto One!"</p>
      <p>On his Facebook page, the councillor said he spoke to Mr Ferris about "how he's been the victim of big corporate interests going after the little guy".</p>
      <p>He added: "Mark, you have my full support and I certainly would personally encourage you all to read into the case and consider boycotting Tayto in NI until they stop this campaign against a small local business."</p>
      <p>The councillor for Newry, Mourne and Down District Council also shared a website link to an Irish News interview with Mr Ferris.</p>

      <p>Tayto in the Republic was founded in 1954, while Tayto NI began in 1956 with a licensing deal. The two companies operate entirely separately.</p>
      <p>The legal action has highlighted the strict commercial distinctions between the two famous brands.</p>
      <p>Last week British prime minister Boris Johnson visited Tayto NI's Tandragee factory in Co Armagh.</p>
      <p>The DUP's Gareth Wilson, a councillor in Co Armagh, yesterday rejected the call for a boycott.</p>
      <p>"Tayto is a very important and valued local trader and I would not endorse any boycott of the employer or Tayto generally, as they have been such a mainstay in our borough and in the county, and successful as well," he said.</p>
      <p>"Any agreement on sales either side of the border should be respected."</p>
      <p>He added: "You would have a hard job telling the people of Northern Ireland to stop eating Tayto crisps."</p>
      <p>Tayto did not respond to calls for a comment.</p>
      <p>Legal action was taken against Mr Ferris over selling southern Tayto to shops and pubs in Northern Ireland, and the case reached Belfast's High Court in September.</p>
      <p>His barrister confirmed to the court that the trademark breach was admitted, but stressed that the southern Tayto crisps were legally purchased.</p>
      <p>Counsel for the northern firm based in Tandragree, Co Armagh, insisted the case was about protecting its trademark.</p>
      <p>A judge awarded costs to the company and remitted the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations.</p>
