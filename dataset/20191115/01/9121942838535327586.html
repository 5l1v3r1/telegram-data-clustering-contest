      <p>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A United Nations report says it has corroborated evidence of five attacks allegedly carried out by Kenya’s military on communication masts belonging to neighboring Somalia’s largest telecom provider.</p>
      <p>The U.N. panel of experts monitoring sanctions against Somalia says one attack killed two civilians in 2018.</p>
      <p>The report says Kenya’s military denied involvement in the attacks. The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.</p>
      <p>Hormuud Telecom Somalia says the attacks violate international law. The company asserts that its communications masts have been attacked 10 times by Kenya’s military over the past two years.</p>
      <p>The report says destroying telecommunication masts may prevent al-Shabab extremists from triggering explosives using mobile telephone signals.</p>
      <p>Kenya sent troops to Somalia in 2011 to fight al-Shabab, which also carries out attacks inside Kenya.</p>
