      <p>A speeding motorist who hit and killed Dutch cyclist Gitta Scheenhouwer as he was on his way to buy drugs in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne">Melbourne</a> has been jailed for 11 years.</p>
      <p>Michael Panayides slammed into cyclist Gitta Scheenhouwer, 27, in Chapel Street , leaving her dead.</p>
      <p>“It’s a serious case of negligent culpable driving emanating from blatant disregard for the life and safety of others on the road,” county court judge Michael McInerney said on Friday, jailing him for 11 years with a minimum of eight-and-a-half years. Panayides was also handed a 20-year driving ban.</p>
      <p>Panayides <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/23/melbourne-driver-who-fled-after-running-over-dutch-cyclist-pleads-guilty">pleaded guilty in January to six charges over the death.</a> He admitted culpable driving causing death, unlicensed driving, failing to render assistance, negligently dealing with proceeds of crime, vehicle theft and recklessly causing injury.</p>
      <p>Four other charges were withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Panayides was driving a stolen Mercedes when he cut into a bike lane, pushing the cyclist against another vehicle before fleeing.</p>
