      <h1>Sonny Bill Williams signing shows Toronto Wolfpack's global ambition is on right track</h1>
      <h2>Unveiling of former All Black Williams is bringing dream closer for Toronto owner Eric Perez in bid to give rugby league worldwide appeal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:18:28+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:18</time> by <a rel="author">Nigel Wiskar, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nigel-wiskar/</a></address>
      <p>Sonny Bill Williams was presented to the world's media at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The former All Black and New Zealand heavyweight boxing champion is returning to rugby league with Toronto Wolfpack.</p>
      <p>Our man <b>Nigel Wiskar</b> was there to take in the scene.</p>
      <p>The banners attached to the middle tier of the Emirates Stadium give an indication to the global nature of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>They come from far and wide and run all the way around the pitch. Arsenal Kenya, Seychelles Gunners, Arsenal Singapore, Maltese Gunners are all up there, the traditional red and white colour scheme broken by a rather garish green and gold Arsenal Australia effort.</p>
      <p>You can see them from the balcony attached to the Woolwich Suite of the club where over 50 press and broadcasters have gathered to see <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sonny-bill-williams">Sonny Bill Williams</a> officially unveiled as a Toronto Wolfpack signing.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He’s not a global brand yet but over the course of the next two hours you would think so, such is the attention this large, softly spoken man commands.</p>
      <p>He’s wearing a black long-sleeved top, black trousers, black socks and white trainers. Not quite all black then and now no longer an All Black either.</p>
      <p>He is flanked by Wolfpack CEO Bob Hunter to his right and head coach Brian McDermott on his left.</p>
      <p>Hunter wears a permanent grin, like a man who’s won the UK Lottery and its Ontario counterpart on the same day.</p>
      <p>McDermott, as ever, is more reserved but speaks thoughtfully and intelligently about the prize cargo coming to town.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He admits he “verbally machine-gunned” Williams when the pair sat down for a 45-minute chat which morphed into two hours, soon after England had beaten New Zealand in the semi-final of the union World Cup.</p>
      <p>McDermott says it was one of the best games of rugby he had seen with the room breaking into laughter when Williams gently shakes his head.</p>
      <p>“I’m normally a funny man. I don’t know why you’re laughing,” says McDermott before he realises what has happened.</p>
      <p>There is mention of the buzz word ‘brand’, a word that will resurface throughout the afternoon, a word more associated with the likes of David Beckham (or Bickham as one of the Kiwi journalists says).</p>
      <p>And then the nitty gritty. No hype and bravado and quick sell over his stellar signing, just the straight pragmatism we’ve come to expect from McDermott.</p>

      <p>“I see him making a mark in the final third of the year, not from round one. There is a transition from union,” he says.</p>
      <p>That's not quite on-message but it shows who is boss at the club.</p>
      <p>More chat about “a billion eyes” on that rugby union game and on the "product".</p>
      <p>At this point it’s easy to forget we are hear to talk about Williams’ considerable skills on a piece of turf, artificial or not.</p>
      <p>Finally Williams gets to speak. He’s quizzed by reporters from Australia and New Zealand before the man from the BBC gets a question in.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He undoubtedly has a presence and when he’s next placed in front of a Wolfpack backdrop for TV interviews, the bright lights frame his considerable features like a film star.</p>
      <p>He finally sits at a circular table for time with the reporters from the UK, shaking mine and everyone else's hand one by one and displaying the charm his CEO will be hoping is translated into shirts off the rack, bums on seats and clicks on sites.</p>
      <p>He discusses his Muslim faith, his family and his belief he can have a genuine impact on kids in North America.</p>
      <p>This is a man brought up in a home with no wallpaper but he admits to us he trained twice a day at the ages of 13 and 14 so he could get on TV and buy his mum a home.</p>
      <p>And then he’s away. More interviews, more appointments. Life is busy when you’re a brand.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Five years ago I sat in a cafe called School opposite Wolfpack’s Lamport Stadium having breakfast with Eric Perez.</p>
      <p>We talked about Toronto, about Iron Maiden and about his dream to form a rugby league club that would play in that stadium.</p>
      <p>The table of three young women next to us giggled through their brunch.</p>
      <p>“I want them coming to our games too,” he whispered. “We want everyone to come and enjoy the greatest game.”</p>
      <p>I caught the tram later from the north side of the ground back into the city wondering whether I was speaking to a genius or a lunatic.</p>
      <p>Seeing Sonny Bill Williams at Arsenal with the flashbulbs going off and everybody wanting a little piece of him would suggest Perez is a genius.</p>
      <p>On the wall on the opposite side of the Woolwich Suite from Arsenal's pitch is a saying from legendary manager Herbert Chapman in 1925.</p>
      <p>It reads: “I am going to make this club the greatest in the world.”</p>
      <p>It sounds like something Perez would say.</p>
      <p>You suspect Sonny Bill is too modest to utter those words but watch this space. Anything is possible.</p>
