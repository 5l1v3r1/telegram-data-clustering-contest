      <p>Atlanta and Chicago collide on <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Future/profile">Future</a>'s latest single "Last Name" as he calls on <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lildurk/profile">Lil Durk</a> to lend his vocals to the track. Future first teased the song on Instagram about a month ago, sharing that his "Spin The Block" collaborator would also be featured on this new single. In his verses, the Chicago rapper shares a few perils of the streets, while Future takes a nod at his recent paternity controversies in his lyrics. "<i>F*ck the b*tch once, now she wanna cry</i>," he raps, adding "<i>I don't know her name, she wanna have my child</i>."</p>
      <p>Future <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/future-claims-alleged-baby-mama-is-attempting-to-extort-him-lying-about-employment-news.94304.html">has been battling it out in court with two women who claim that he's the father of their babies</a>. The rapper reportedly believes that he isn't responsible for either child, but the women would like DNA tests to prove otherwise. "Last Name" isn't a direct acknowledgment of those rumors, but more of artistic take on being fearful that certain women are trying to trick him into a form of commitment. Let us know what you think.</p>

      <p>Gotta keep it stashed up for the trial<br/>Material intentions, gotta play a foul<br/>I'm a rare form, like a hyena runnin' wild<br/>All the opps gettin' gunned down</p>
