        <b>Spanish Police have arrested six people in an operation to dismantle an illegal printing works in Huelva (Andalusia) that produced counterfeit notes that were distributed in Spain and Portugal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a joint operation with Europol (the body that coordinates the European police forces), a clandestine printing plant was “dismantled” in Huelva and “the distribution” of 250,000 counterfeit euros in Spain and Portugal was avoided.</p>
      <p>More than 8,200 euros in counterfeit notes with a face value of 10, 20 and 50 euros, two pistols, three printers, three computers, large quantities of paper, metallic materials, ink cartridges, cutting instruments and other materials for counterfeiting money were also seized.</p>
      <p>The police explained that the investigation began in March of this year, when counterfeit notes were detected, and it was concluded that the criminal organisation operated from the province of Huelva, which borders the Algarve, where the notes were apparently distributed in small shops and bars.</p>
      <p>The police then discovered that the counterfeiters not only distributed them in southern Spain, but also in Portugal.<br/>“Once the printer had been dismantled and the person responsible for the counterfeit had been arrested, the investigators located and arrested the five distributors of the counterfeit notes.</p>
