      <p>Disney+ is finally here, and the house of mouse's streaming service is just as essential as fans of Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars expected it would be. Since the launch is still fresh, you may be wondering<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-watch-disney-on-roku-a-step-by-step-guide-19344818"> how to watch Disney+ on your Fire Stick</a>. At one point, it didn't look like <a href="https://www.techjunkie.com/add-disney-plus-firestick/">Amazon and Disney were going to work out an agreement</a> for the app to be available on Amazon devices, but thankfully, the two companies worked the situation out. That means that if you own an Amazon Fire Stick, you're just a few clicks away from streaming originals like <i>The Mandalorian</i> or old favorites like <i>The Little Mermaid</i>.</p>
      <p>Before launching the app on your Fire Stick, you can save yourself some time by <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/bundle">signing up for Disney+</a> online. Just navigate to the official Disney+ website via your browser, and create an account. New users can try the service free for seven days. After the trial period ends, the streamer will charge you a $6.99/month fee (plus tax, where applicable). The monthly fee gives you instant access to original shows and movies including the live-action <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/disney-is-finally-launching-heres-how-to-get-7-free-days-of-the-new-streaming-service-19212363"><i>Lady and the Tramp</i>, <i>Noelle</i></a>, and <i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</i>, as well as the extensive library of Disney and Pixar classics, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/why-disney-doesnt-include-all-marvel-studios-movies-19342868">Marvel superhero movies</a>, the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, and more.</p>
