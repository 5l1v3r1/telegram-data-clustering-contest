      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - The rights to broadcast Champions League games in Britain have been retained by BT Sport for another three seasons in a deal worth more than $1.5 billion, The Associated Press has learned.</p>
      <p>The telecommunications company will continue to show every game live and air highlights in the 2021-2024 rights cycle as the competition's only British broadcaster, a person familiar with the three-year deal said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal ahead of an official announcement.</p>
      <p>Britain is UEFA's most lucrative market for Champions League rights. The 2018-2021 contract is worth 394 million pounds per year, or just over $500 million. The new deal is not worth less than 1.2 billion pounds ($1.55 billion).</p>
      <p>UEFA has protected the value from Champions League rights in Britain. That contrasts with the Premier League, which has seen domestic broadcast revenue drop 8% from this season under the terms of deals held predominantly by Sky and BT. However, its international revenue has risen.</p>
      <p>The UEFA deal means games in European football's elite competition in Britain will remain on subscription television, although BT has made the final available for free.</p>
      <p>BT faced opposition from satellite broadcaster Sky, which was bought last year by American telecommunications conglomerate Comcast. It was trying to regain rights it held until 2015.</p>
      <p>Free-to-air channel ITV was also exploring regaining rights, having shown some games live until 2015.</p>
      <p>English teams have contested the last two Champions League finals, with Liverpool losing to Real Madrid in 2018 before beating Premier League rival Tottenham in last season's showpiece.</p>
      <p>The 2023 final will be staged in London at Wembley Stadium.</p>
      <p>BT Sport is part of the former state-owned telecoms monopoly, British Telecom, which became a private business in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>The sports broadcasting operation, which began in 2013 after winning some live rights to Premier League games, is based at the former broadcast base for the 2012 London Olympics.</p>
      <p>UEFA has already struck a deal in the United States for 2021-24. The AP reported last week that CBS and Univision will pay a combined $140 million, an increase from the $100 million in the current Turner-Univision deal.</p>
