      <p><b>ORINDA, Calif.Â (AP)</b> - Four men were arrested Thursday on suspicion of murder in the deaths of five people in a shooting at a Halloween party at an Airbnb rental home in the San Francisco Bay Area. A fifth man was arrested on a charge of being an accessory to the crime, the Contra Costa Sheriff's Department said.</p>
      <p>Sheriff David Livingston said search warrants were executed in several Northern California cities Thursday. He did not address a possible motive in the fatal shootings in Orinda that sent more than 100 terrified partygoers running for safety, but he said in a statement that investigators found two of the victims were armed, "which may have played a role in this tragedy."</p>
      <p>Tiyon Farley, 22, of Antioch; Omar Taylor, 24, of Pittsburg; Raymon Hill Jr., 23, of San Francisco and Oakland; Javlin County, 29, of Sausalito and Richmond; and Oshiana Tompkins, 19, of Vallejo and Hercules, died in the shooting and at least four others were injured.</p>
      <p>"Extraordinary cooperation among multiple law enforcement agencies led to these arrests and a small measure of justice for the true victims," Livingston said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Those arrested Thursday were: Lebraun Tyree Wallace, 28, of San Mateo; Shamron Joshua Mitchell, 30, of Antioch; and Jaquez Deshawn Sweeney and Jason D. Iles, both 20 and of Marin City on charges of murder and conspiracy. All four were being held without bail.</p>
      <p>Devin Isiah Williamson, 21, of Vallejo, was arrested as an accessory and was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail.</p>
      <p>Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky has since said that the San Francisco-based company was taking steps to stop unauthorized parties in the wake of the deadly shooting. In a series of tweets Nov. 2, Chesky said company is stepping up efforts to "combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct."</p>
