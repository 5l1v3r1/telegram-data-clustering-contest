        <b>The presidents of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, and Italy, Sergio Mattarella, said they share the same vision on the European project and defended the importance of a common EU position on migration.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Europe is entering a new cycle and in this new cycle Italy and Portugal agree on the essentials: Europe must have a common position on migration”, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said, adding that “Portugal thanks Italy for the courage, almost the heroism, with which it faced this drama alone at the outset”.</p>
      <p>Sergio Mattarella also said that there is “a common vision” between the two countries on the current European framework and promised that Italy will support the Portuguese presidency of the European Union in 2021 “in all ways”.</p>
      <p>On the subject of migration, the Italian president maintained that “only the Union has the size and the possibility to tackle the problem effectively” and that no Member State is capable of doing so alone.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also said that “Portugal has shown its solidarity in welcoming migrants, in supporting Italy” and has been committed “to finding solutions that are from all over Europe, but flexible, sensible, moderate - as is the case of those recently agreed upon in Malta”.</p>
