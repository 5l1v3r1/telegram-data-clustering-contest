      <p>Brian Ortega will look to get back on track when he travels all the way to Busan, South Korea to face Chan Sung Jung in the main event of UFC Fight Night 165 on Dec. 21, 2019, and now, UFC has released the poster for the UFC on <a href="http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?sharedid=MMAMania&amp;subId1=xid:fr1573773761919jhh">ESPN+</a>-streamed event.</p>
      <p>“T-City” suffered the first loss of his professional career last December after losing via fourth round technical knockout (<a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/12/9/18132139/ufc-231-full-fight-video-highlights-max-holloway-knockout-brian-ortega-mma-ppv-toronto">doctor stoppage</a>) to Featherweight champion, Max Holloway.
