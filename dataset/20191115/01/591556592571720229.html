      <p>An October <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1de32ce0-f647-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654">ruling</a> by the Supreme Court of India that has led to Indian telcos coughing up $13 billion in fees has wiped out the positive numbers from Singtel's second quarter earnings. <br/><br/>Singtel's Indian associate, Bharti Airtel, has allocated 2.9 billion rupees (SG$5.5 billion) for payments, which has translated to Singtel's earnings as a SG$1.93 billion pre-tax hit, and SG$1.4 billion post-tax. <br/><br/>This has left Singtel with a SG$668 million net loss for the second quarter to September 30, undoing increases in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) and increases in associate revenue. <br/><br/>For the entire company, revenue dropped 3% to SG$4.15 billion as EBITDA increased by 3% to SG$1.17 billion, giving an underlying net profit number of SG$737 million prior to the Airtel hit. <br/><br/>In Singapore, consumer revenue grew by 2% to SG$563 million as increased equipment sales made up for a drop in mobile service revenue and fixed services, while EBITDA increased 4.5% to SG$191 million.</p>
      <p>Singtel now has 2.6 million postpaid customers in Singapore and 1.6 million prepaid customers. Average revenue per user (ARPU) is now down to SG$30 as postpaid ARPU has decreased SG$4 over the past year to AU$39, and prepaid is down a SG$1 to SG$17. <br/><br/>Revenue was down 5% in the enterprise sector to SG$1.49 billion, with EBITDA falling 12% to SG$389 million. Singtel said the drop in EBITDA was due to its Australian operations, which otherwise saw EBITDA decrease by 1.7%.</p>
      <p>For its regional associate telcos, Indonesia's Telkomsel saw contributed revenue steady at SG$290 million; in Thailand, AIS saw revenue increase by 31% to SG$103 while Intouch grew revenue by 32% to SG$29 million; Globe in the Philippines was up 18% to SG$104; while Airtel decreased its loss to SG$112 million across India, Sri Lanka, and Africa. <br/><br/>"Notwithstanding the court ruling, Airtel has made positive strides in the wake of the recent industry consolidation, gaining market share, and increasing mobile service revenue for a third straight quarter," Singtel CEO Chua Sock Koong said. <br/><br/>"The weak global economic environment has affected the industry although on a positive note, our diversified earnings base and our cost management have lifted our performance." <br/><br/>Across the Singtel group, staff costs were down 2.6%, mostly made up of a 12% headcount reduction year-on-year within its Australian Optus operations. Optus now has a headcount of 7,092 while the rest of the group accounts for 16,000 people. <br/><br/>The company added it is preparing plans to build out its Singaporean 5G network, while Optus now has <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/optus-makes-5g-home-fixed-wireless-generally-available/">300 5G towers in Australia</a>. <br/><br/>For its second quarter, Optus reported revenue was steady at AU$2.2 billion as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nbn-migration-revenue-helps-optus-to-rosy-second-quarter/">profitability increased</a> by 11% to AU$703 million. <br/><br/>Three months ago, Singtel reported a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/airtel-pinned-for-dragging-singtel-q1-down/">slight dip in revenue</a> of SG$21 million to SG$4.1 billion alongside a 2% drop in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) to SG$1.18 billion for its first quarter of fiscal year 2020 to June 30. <br/><br/>Thanks to a SG$162 million exceptional loss by Airtel and increased depreciation, Singtel saw its underlying net profit drop by 22% to SG$575 million and net profit fall 35% from SG$832 million to SG$541 million. <br/><br/>The loss by Airtel was related to provisioning for "derivative liabilities relating to customary indemnities provided to a group of investors of Airtel Africa and expenses relating to its listing", as well as depreciating 3G assets and spectrum refarming, the company said.</p>
