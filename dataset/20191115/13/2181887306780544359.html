      <h1>The cost of a sponsored post on Instagram has shot up 1,125 per cent since 2014</h1>
      <h2>Not making friends, but influencing people</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:33:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/6082/alan-martin" target="_blank">Alan Martin</a></address>
      <p><b>MARKETING FIRM IZEA</b> has just released a report that's likely to make you choke on your cool, refreshing Pepsi Max*. It seems the average rate a brand will pay for a sponsored Instagram photo has risen from $134 in 2014 to $1,642 this year. </p>
      <p>But don't go reaching for an inferior caffeinated Cola brand* just yet, because that's just the tip of the iceberg. The <a href="https://izea.com/influencer-marketing-statistics/">report</a> highlights that influencer rates have been going up across the board. A Facebook status update would once have set you back a bargain $8 is now worth $395, while a $29 Twitter post would now cost $422 a pop. In the same time period, a branded YouTube video encouraging you to smash that Like button was once a steal at $420 - now it comes to $6,700.  </p>
      <p>It makes you wonder who your real friends are - you know, the ones you'd happily meet for a round of Pepsi Max and a brand-appropriate chat*.</p>
      <p>Going back further, a blog post paid for by a company was just $7.39 in 2006, but now you're looking at a whopping $1,442. Poor old LinkedIn doesn't get a look in. Don't worry Microsoft, we'll raise a lip-smackingly good can in your honour anyway*.</p>
      <p>If you're wondering exactly how you can get in on this kind of high-paid action, the chances are you probably can't. Most YouTubers - <a href="https://www.alphr.com/life-culture/1008661/youtubers-money-study">96.5 per cent, in fact</a> - don't earn enough to clear the US poverty line, although that might not stop you being <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3078417/social-media-influencers-now-have-a-benchmark-for-being-bona-fide-celebs">classified as a celebrity by the ASA if you have 30,000 followers or more</a>. µ</p>
      <p>*That comes to $1,442 by our count, Pepsi. Not that you asked. Wait, is that not how this works?</p>
