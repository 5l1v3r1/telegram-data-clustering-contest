      <h1>Google Teaches You to Pronounce Difficult Words</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:57:50+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>There is no shame in mispronouncing words: <a href="https://youtu.be/9GHPNKUMf70?t=197">Even Benedict Cumberbatch needs help sometimes</a>.</p>
      <p>But whether you’ve been mangling “mischievous” or garbing “GIF,” <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/how-do-you-pronounce-quokka-practice-search">Google’s new experimental pronunciation tool</a> can help.</p>
      <p>The function, built directly into <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/google-maps-audibly-translates-place-names-so-you-dont-have-to-1810496/">Search</a>, lets users practice how to say words.</p>
      <p>Previously, queries like “How to pronounce quokka” offered only a brief audio clip.</p>
      <p>Now, users can practice saying “quokka” into their handset’s microphone and receive feedback on what, if anything, can be adjusted.</p>
      <p>The mobile feature is rolling out in American English first, with Spanish soon to follow.</p>
      <p>You can also try it on desktop, where a <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/google-maps-adds-voice-guidance-for-visually-impaired-1807060/">friendly voice</a> told me how to pronounce “quinoa” in American and British English. (It is disappointingly exactly the same.)</p>
      <p>“Studies have shown that practicing how to say a word can be helpful for remembering it, especially when you’re learning a new language,” Tal Snir, senior product manager for Search, wrote in a blog announcement.</p>

      <p>Using machine learning, Google can automatically recognize spoken words as individual soundbites, then cross-reference pronunciations.</p>
      <p>If you’re practicing the word “asterisk,” for instance, the algorithm analyzes how you said the word and recognizes that the last soundbite was pronounced “rict,” instead of “uhsk.”</p>
      <p>Based on this, it provides feedback that <s>you’re stupid and need to learn how to properly speak English</s> you can improve.</p>
      <p>Auditory cues are great. But I’m a visual learner, and retain information best when looking at related images. Which is why Google also includes photos for additional context.</p>
      <p>Not all words are easily described with a picture, so Google is starting with nouns and plans to expand into more parts of speech.</p>
      <p>“Advances in speech recognition and machine learning can improve the way we learn about languages,” Snir said. “We hope these new features give you a creative, more effective way to practice, visualize, and remember new words.”</p>
      <p>Keep an ear out for more languages, accents, and regions in the future.</p>
