      <h1>Meghan Markle Secretly Hosted Hillary Clinton at Frogmore Cottage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:39:30+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:39</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Archie got to meet another major political figure, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, this week, the <i><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7687095/Hilary-Clinton-visited-Meghan-Markle-Frogmore-Cottage-Tuesday.html">Daily Mail</a> </i>reports. Clinton visited Meghan Markle and her 6-month-old son at their Frogmore Cottage home in Windsor, England on Tuesday. Markle invited her.</p>
      <p>Multiple sources told the outlet that Markle and Clinton hugged and had a "fan girl" meeting. Clinton also got to "cuddle" Archie, the <i>Daily Mail</i> reports. Clinton talked about her new grandson, Jasper, the outlet noted.</p>
      <p>"Both women have a lot of admiration for each other and it was a very sweet, warm meeting," the source said. "They are mutual fan girls!"</p>
      <p>Clinton's visit comes days after she praised Markle and called out the tabloids' racist mistreatment of her during <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50387004">a BBC Radio</a> interview.</p>
      <p>“To think that some of your—what we would call mainstream—media actually allowed that to be printed in their pages, or amplified, was heartbreaking and wrong,” Clinton said.</p>
      <p>She agreed that there has been a racist element to the tabloids' negative stories about Markle. “I think even if you go back and look at social media from the time the engagement was announced, race was clearly an element in it,” Clinton said.</p>
      <p>"She is an amazing young woman, she has an incredible life story," Clinton continued. "She has stood up for herself, she has made her own way in the world. And then she falls in love, and he falls in love with her, and everybody should be celebrating that because it is a true love story."</p>
      <p>"I feel as a mother I just want to put my arms around her. Oh my God, I want to hug her," Clinton said. "I want to tell her to hang in there, don't let those bad guys get you down."</p>
