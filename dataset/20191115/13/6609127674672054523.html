        <b>UNDERGO a hysterectomy and never have children or endure years of excrutiating pain with your "insides wrapped in barbed wire".</b>
      </p>
      <p>These were the two devastating options offered to a 21-year-old who hadn't even thought about starting a family yet.</p>

      <p>Lucy-Anne Patterson, from Dunfermline, was forced to choose after being diagnosed with endometriosis, a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/4757264/endometriosis-symptoms-treatment/">chronic and debilitating gynaecological condition that can lead to infertility</a>.</p>
      <p>Now 35, the endo warrior can proudly say she is a "full-time mummy" to two adorable little girls.</p>
      <p>Recalling the decision she faced in her 20s, Lucy-Anne is relieved she opted not to have the major surgery to remove her womb.</p>
      <p>According to NHS guidelines, it is usually only performed on women who have found other treatments unsuccessful and who have decided to not have any more children.</p>
      <p>Lucy-Anne, engaged to Partick Thistle star Joe Cardle, said: "I have lived with endometriosis for years and only got diagnosed when I was 21.</p>
      <p>"I started having pain in my teens, and everyone told me it was normal.</p>

      <p>"It continued to get worse over the years until finally I was diagnosed with endo."</p>
      <p>Before diagnosis, Lucy-Anne was told she had ulcerative colitis, then IBS - and one doctor even suggested the pain was all in her head.</p>
      <p>She added: "I was missing school and work a lot and during my periods I couldn't get out of bed.</p>
      <h3>#endoperiodstigma</h3>
      <p>The Scottish Sun Online has teamed up with <a href="https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/">Endometriosis UK</a> to raise awareness of endometriosis, a chronic and debilitating condition that causes painful periods and affects one in 10 UK women.</p>
      <p>The campaign will run on The Scottish Sun website until March 2020 -Endometriosis Awareness Month - and will tell the stories of women living with endo.</p>
      <p>News Scotland, which includes The Scottish Sun, The Times Scotland and The Sunday Times Scotland, is also delighted to announce it has become the second official <a href="https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/endometriosis-friendly-employer-scheme">Endometriosis Friendly Employer</a> in the UK.</p>
      <p>By March we hope to have signed up 100 new businesses - <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/4922941/endometriosis-friendly-employer-sign-up/">read how easy it is to do so here and join us</a>!</p>
      <p>Follow the campaign at <a href="http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/endo">www.thescottishsun.co.uk/endo</a> and join in the conversation on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thescottishsun">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottishSun">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishsuninsta/">Instagram</a>.</p>

      <p>"I looked six months pregnant with bloating, was constantly sick and tired.</p>
      <p>"At 21 I was told I had to have a hysterectomy - it was the only cure.</p>
      <p>"Back then, nobody specialised in endo."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Thankfully, a family friend who specialised in endometriosis in the US swooped in to help after hearing about the hysterectomy plans.</p>
      <p>Lucy-Anne, who is originally from Aberdeen, was flown out to Houston where a dedicated team used laser excision to rid her of her extensive endo damage.</p>
      <p>To everyone’s surprise, she found out she was seven weeks pregnant when she went back to the States for her check up.</p>
      <p>But she sadly she miscarried four days later.</p>
      <p>Fertility problems are not uncommon with endometriosis sufferers because of damage to the fallopian tubes or ovaries.</p>
      <p>Surgery to remove visible patches of endometriosis tissue can sometimes help, but there is still no guarantee you will get pregnant.</p>
      <p>Women with moderate to severe endometriosis also tend to have a lower chance of getting pregnant with IVF than usual.</p>
      <p>Brave Lucy-Anne told the Scottish Sun Online she went on to have a further three miscarriages before being blessed with her two miracle babies.</p>
      <p>She said: "I had another laparoscopy back in 2013 just to check what was going on.</p>
      <p>"I was then diagnosed with lupus and put on Fragmin, for blood clots, and aspirin daily.</p>

        <figcaption>Lucy-Anne has urged women to speak out if they feel in painCredit: Lucy-Anne Patterson</figcaption>

      <p>"After that I fell pregnant straight away and this time managed to carry my little princess Josie-Anne with constant care throughout my pregnancy. She is five now."</p>
      <p>Lucy-Anne then had her second daughter, Lyla Jo, in June 2017.</p>
      <p>But she has started to feel those familiar endo pains since giving birth.</p>
      <blockquote>People find it hard to believe anything is wrong with you as they don’t see why you're in so much pain.<br/>No one ever takes my fiance seriously when he says how much pain I was and am in as they say 'she looks great'.<br/>I looked normal on the outside but on the inside felt like I was wrapped in a barbed wire fence and being torn.<cite>Lucy-Anne Patterson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>She said: "A recent scan showed my endometriosis was back and my ovaries are kissing.</p>
      <p>"I am waiting on a specialist but more surgery will be required.</p>
      <p>"I have been given an injection to suppress my ovaries for the time being and it’s taken the extreme pain away."</p>
      <p>Determined not to let endo control her life, she added: "Having lived with it for so many years and with expert treatment and knowledge I really feel I can keep this under control with certain medicines and most importantly diet."</p>
      <p>And she has urged the public to be more aware of invisible illnesses.</p>
      <p>She said: "People find it hard to believe anything is wrong with you as they don’t see why you're in so much pain.</p>
      <p>"No one ever takes my fiance seriously when he says how much pain I was and am in as they say 'she looks great'.</p>
      <p>"I looked normal on the outside but on the inside felt like I was wrapped in a barbed wire fence and being torn."</p>
      <p>The mum of two has spoken out about her brave battle against endometriosis to support the Scottish Sun Online’s <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4923012/endo-period-stigma-endometriosis/">Endo Period Stigma campaign</a>.</p>
      <p>By March 2020, Endometriosis Awareness Month, we hope to spread the word about the condition and get employers on board as<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/4922941/endometriosis-friendly-employer-sign-up/"> endo-friendly workplaces.</a></p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Lucy-Anne said: "It’s such a huge relief that this disease is being specialised, spoken about and taken seriously in the UK now and girls don’t need to suffer like I did.</p>
      <p>"Speak up if you’re hurting, don’t hide away in pain. I was so lucky to have the care I did."</p>
      <p>She added: "Even though my endo has come back, even after a traumatic few years, I still feel amazing, happy and love myself.</p>
      <p>"When you’ve accepted that life is taking you down a path different from the one you wanted, it’s a miracle to wake up and realise you have everything you ever hoped for - my beautiful daughters. "They are the definition of a miracle.</p>
      <p>"I owe everything to the amazing team in Houston, my parents and my fiancé who has taken such a interest in my illness so he could support me every step of the way."</p>
