      <p>The water crisis in Zimbabwe has brought the inner devil out of many people as the stress and frustration keeps mounting.</p>
      <p>In a video making rounds on social media residents were captured fighting for turns at the borehole at a yet to be identified location.</p>
      <p>So dire is the water crisis in Zimbabwe that in some areas people are waking up as early as 3  a.m.to fetch water from a communal borehole and will still be waiting for their turn at the borehole by early afternoon.</p>
