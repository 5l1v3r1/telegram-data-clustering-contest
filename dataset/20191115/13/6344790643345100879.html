      <h1>Kristen Stewart Is Harassed by the FBI in Fascinating First Trailer for SEBERG</h1>

      <p><b>Kristen Stewart</b> (<i>American Ultra</i>, <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>) stars in the new trailer for true story <b><i>Seberg</i></b>, based on the French actress <b>Jean Seberg</b>, who starred in the 1960 film <i>Breathless</i>. Seberg was an activist who was targeted by J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI because of her being seen as a sympathizer with the Black Panther Party and her involvement with activist Hakim Jamal.</p>
      <p>When I first reported on Stewart taking the role, I didn’t realize how much of a political thriller the film would be. I’m interested to see how Seberg’s life plays out in the film, and I think Stewart and the rest of the cast look great in the roles. Stewart is joined by <b>Jack O’Connell</b>, <b>Margaret Qualley</b>, <b>Zazie Beetz</b>, <b>Vince Vaughn</b>, <b>Anthony Mackie</b>, <b>Jade Pettyjohn</b>, <b>Stephen Root</b>, and <b>Colm Meaney</b>.</p>
      <blockquote>Seberg is inspired by true events about the French New Wave darling and Breathless star, Jean Seberg (Kristen Stewart), who in the late 1960s was targeted by the FBI because of her support of the civil rights movement and romantic involvement with Hakim Jamal (Anthony Mackie), among others. In Benedict Andrews’ noir-ish thriller, Seberg’s life and career are destroyed by Hoover’s overreaching surveillance and harassment in an effort to suppress and discredit Seberg’s activism.</blockquote>
