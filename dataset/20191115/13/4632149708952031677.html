      <h1>Aayushmanbhava movie review: This flick tears you between the love for Shiva Rajkumar and the promise of expectations betrayed</h1>

      <p><i>Standard government insurance<br/></i><br/>A plot utterly predictable, characters too buttery and a complete disregard for the intelligence of the audience, Aayushmanbhava tears you between the love for Shiva Rajkumar and the promise of expectations betrayed. <br/><br/>A mystery man gains the confidence of a large joint family and begins to live with them, taking care of the patriarch. That he has some ulterior motive is not hidden from the audience. It is a relief that the motive is not the bringing together of a long-estranged family member or rapprochement with another feuding family. The rest of the film however follows that staple Tollywood formula. <br/><br/>In short, the film falls short of expectations. Post interval, while the requirement was more meat to the story, it takes a very easy path. It is completely dependent on Gurukiran's compositions to even keep the audience interested. The music is top class, one of the best by Gurukiran, but that alone is not enough to save the film from spiralling down to irrelevance. <br/><br/>Shiva Rajkumar gets younger with each film and breezes through the film with ease. Rachita Ram has a challenging role and delivers a performance to remember. The ensemble cast is too large and perform the roles of caricatures you have seen in a zillion films till now. Technology should soon replace them with cardboards. <br/><br/>Aayushmanbhava is very unadventurous. There is clinical precision to the way P Vasu has scripted it. So clinical that it is sterile. Everyone is beautiful and handsome, Sadhu Kokila gets slapped by everyone, comedy bits are injected to the run towards the climax, fights and additional songs are strategically placed, the richer man arrives in a Rolls-Royce and the length is standard. It is a jigsaw puzzle you have played for ages and can piece together with your eyes closed.</p>
