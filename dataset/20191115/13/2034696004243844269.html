      </p>
      <p>Noel Fielding has revealed that he’s set to pen a new <a href="http://nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> show about a magical record player.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://nme.com/tag/the-mighty-boosh"><i>Mighty Boosh</i></a> creator/<i>Great British Bake-</i><i>Off</i> judge revealed the news while chatting on BBC Radio 6 Music.</p>

      <p>Speaking on the show (via <a href="https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2019/11/07/44707/netflix_series_for_noel_fielding"><i>Chortle</i></a>), Fielding revealed that he’s got the sign-off from Netflix on the show, and he’s set to begin writing soon. He went on to explain a little about the idea.</p>
      <p>“Basically a guy gets hold of a magic record player and when you put the record player on a portal appears and you can go inside your favourite albums,” he said.</p>

      <p>Fielding continued: “I haven’t written it yet. I pitched it and Netflix liked it and we’re making it, but I haven’t started writing it yet. So that’s my next thing.”</p>
      <p>“It’s a good concept but how I write it, I could come at it from many different angles and I’m trying to work out the best way.”</p>
      <p>The series will reportedly come in six parts and be co-written by Matt Haydock.</p>
