      <h1>IPL 2020: Rajasthan Royals releases Unadkat, trades Rahane</h1>
      <h2>The franchise has retained Australian Steve Smith as captain of the team.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:40:32+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/P-K-Ajith-Kumar-862/" target="_blank">P.K. Ajith Kumar</a></address>
      <p>Steve Smith has been retained as captain by Rajasthan Royals, while the man who led the side for the earlier part of the last IPL, Ajinkya Rahane, will move to Delhi Capitals.</p>
      <p>The India Test batsman has been traded for leg-spinner Mayank Markande and all-rounder Rahul Tewatia. The Royals have retained 11 players and released as many.</p>
      <p>KXI Punjab's pacer Ankit Rajpoot has been traded for off-spinning all-rounder K. Gowtham.</p>
      <p>Among the major players released are left-arm seamer Jaydev Unadkat, the costliest player for the last two years in a row (the Royals released him and bought him back again), Ashton Turner, Ish Sodhi, Oshane Thomas and Liam Livingstone.</p>
      <p>Those retained include England's World-Cup winning trio of Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer, Sanju Samson, Varun Aaron and Shreyas Gopal. Pacer Dhawal Kulkarni is traded off to Mumbai Indians.</p>

      <p>“We have done some trades keeping in mind the combination that we wish to establish and will further work on securing players during the auction that are required to fill necessary roles,” the newly appointed Royals coach Andrew McDonald said. “My main objective will be to work on improving the squad and set a style of cricket that can win us the IPL.”</p>
      <p>His fellow-Australian Smith said it was an honour to be named the Rajasthan Royals captain for the 2020 season. “It’s been a pleasure leading the Royals in previous years and I can't wait to play alongside this extremely talented squad, plus those we pick up in the auction,” he said.</p>
      <p>After the trades and releases, the Rajasthan Royals has a total purse of ₹28.9 crores available for the auction.</p>
