      <h3>Bill 207 a risk to rights</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: How health services could be denied with impunity in Alberta, Nov. 14</b>
      </p>
      <p>I wonder if this bill is Ultra Vires (outside the power of the legislature), resulting in a failure to comply with the principles  of fundamental justice. The government is supporting one conscientiously held belief at the expense of another, and in effect, depriving women of their “essential humanity”.</p>
      <p>The decision whether to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral one, a matter of conscience. I do not think there can be any dispute about that. The question is: whose conscience? Is the conscience of the woman to be paramount or the conscience of her medical practitioner? I believe, that in a free and democratic society, it must be the conscience of the individual.</p>

      <h3>Nurses committed to care; what about those paying them?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: If you want to cut OT for nurses, hire more of them; Nursing shortage in Alberta will only worsen in years ahead, Opinion, Nov. 13</b>
      </p>
      <p>Heather Smith is right! Ever since Tommy Douglas introduced medicare through the governments for financial reasons, the political emphasis has been on finance and not patient care. It is as predicted. If it weren’t for the dedication of health-care workers there would be much less health care delivered to the people of Canada. It is expected of every nurse that they must contribute innumerable hours of unpaid overtime and they do it out of personal commitment to their patients and profession. Hurrah for them! Boos to the politicians, the government and their minions.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Thanks for a sane defence of the separation of church and state. It’s heartening to read a story reminding one of the values of liberal democracy without divisive partisanship. Thanks for returning to the Herald as a columnist.</p>

      <h3>Catholics responsible for many great achievements</h3>
      <p>Since you seem keen on spewing the horrors of Christianity and its archaic misogynistic Bible, let me school you. Christianity, especially Catholic culture and Catholic minds, can be thanked for (a multitude of things such as) The Gregorian Calendar, the Big Bang theory, early theory of evolution, science of genetics. Shall we recall the development of the university system. Art and architecture all over the world. The first complete, systematic bodies of law, which led to the founding of law schools. Legal principles such as “good faith,” international law, reciprocity of rights, trial by jury.</p>
      <p>Finally, the status of women. Catholicism is the only religion to exemplify a woman to the degree that is given to Mary: Mother of God.</p>
      <p>Influential and extraordinary women have been the fabric of Christianity: St. Teresa of Calcutta and Mother Angelica, were far from subservient and yet both loved and lived their faith through the foundations of the very Bible you criticize.</p>
