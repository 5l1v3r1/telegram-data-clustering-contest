      <p>The latest Best Buy <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">doorbuster</a> has a 70-inch Samsung 4K TV on sale for just $549. That is good for $350 off of its regular price. That's also the lowest we've seen a 70-inch TV go for, so definitely a really good deal.</p>
      <p>For those of you interested, this is the NU6070 series TV. So it's a couple of years old actually, but TVs don't see massive improvements year-over-year, so it's still a really good buy.</p>
      <p>This TV from Samsung is a smart TV and it runs on its own Tizen OS. This is going to give you access to a ton of great apps that you'd expect from a smart TV in 2019. This includes Hulu, Netflix, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube and even Disney+ that launched earlier this week. So you'll be able to watch a ton of great content on this TV.</p>

      <p>With this one being a 4K TV, you're going to get a pretty incredible picture. This is an LED TV and not a QLED TV, so it's not going to be the best picture that money can buy. But most people will be happy with this one. It does also support HDR10 and HLG standards for HDR. Giving you a really great picture in a lot of different movies and TV shows.</p>
      <p>The only unfortunate thing here is that this TV does not support Dolby Atmos or Dolby Vision. But for most people, this is going to be plenty of TV to keep them happy, especially at just $549.</p>
