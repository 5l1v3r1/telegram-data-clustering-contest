      <p>Wales meet Azerbaijan in a crucial Euro 2020 qualifier in Baku on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs’ side are aiming to keep their automatic qualification hopes alive ahead of their final game against Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency looks at the main talking points around the game.</p>
      <h3>Bale fitness</h3>

      <p>It is almost exactly 12 months since Aaron Ramsey last pulled on a Wales shirt. During that time the midfielder has swapped Arsenal for Juventus and now counts Cristiano Ronaldo and Paulo Dybala as team-mates. Ramsey’s injury problems have prevented him from playing a single minute of Wales’ Euro 2020 qualifying campaign and how the Dragons have missed his creative influence. Ramsey’s return could not be more timely and his passing ability could be the difference in Wales securing a top-two spot or having to settle for the play-offs in March.</p>
      <h3>Defensive dilemma</h3>

      <h3>Tight finish</h3>
      <blockquote><b>Group E table<br/></b>  1. Croatia Pld 7 Pts 14<br/>  2. Hungary Pld 7 Pts 12<br/>  3. Slovakia Pld 6 Pts 10<br/>  4. Wales Pld 6 Pts 8<br/>  5. Azerbaijan Pld 6 Pts 1</blockquote>
      <p>Wales probably need to win their final two games in a complicated picture to secure automatic qualification for the 2020 European Championship finals. Four points would be enough if results elsewhere were to go their way. Beating Azerbaijan and Hungary would be enough, as long as Slovakia do not win their final two games. Slovakia finish away to group leaders Croatia and at home to Azerbaijan. Wales would still finish second by drawing in Azerbaijan and beating Hungary by at least two goals – if Slovakia did not pick up more than two points in the last round of fixtures. Wales would have to settle for a likely play-off spot were they to lose in Azerbaijan or fail to beat Hungary.</p>
