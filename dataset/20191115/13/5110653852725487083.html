      <p>Quincy Enunwa sounded off against the Jets in aTwitter thread after being fined $27,900 for missing two treatment sessions.</p>
      <p>Enunwa shared an image of his fines on social media listing the missed sessions on Nov. 8 and Nov. 11.Enunwa said he missed one session due to an emergency in his house, and he missed the other because he took his wife out for lunch on Veterans Day to celebrate her service.</p>
      <p>The receiver also revealed his NFL future is in jeopardy due to his health. The receiver missed all of 2017 with a neck injury and suffered another neck injury this season, placing him on injured reserve. According to Enunwa, doctors say it's 50/50 whether he'll ever play again.</p>

      <p>"I normally chill on putting issues on twitter, but this doesn't sit right with me,"Enunwa tweeted. "Given everything that’s going on around the team I thought this could’ve been handled so many different ways. I’ve spent my time with the team trying to build myself up to be dependable and hardworking so this s— hurts."</p>

      <p>"I shouldn’t even HAVE to be in that building being reminded everyday of what I can’t do,"Enunwa tweeted. "This s— feels like punishment already and then they FINE me the max. And then want me to continue to do my rehab there and IF I get healthy they want me to then play for them after. I’m not writing this for sympathy and never wanted to even say anything, but when multiple teammates are coming to me saying it’s f—ed up I don’t care to sit on it anymore."</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time this season a player has been upset with the Jets over a medical issue. Offensive lineman Kelechi Osemele had a public dispute with the Jets over the severity of his injury. The Jets fined Osemele forconduct detrimental to the team. He ended up getting surgery (which the Jets claimed he didn't need) and was released shortly after.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Luke Falk was also upset with the team as he reportedly <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/ny-luke-falk-injury-grievance-lawsuit-20191108-sxc5bwvelbfufkal2vzyr3hau4-story.html">filed an injury grievance</a> against the Jets earlier this month. Falk played in three games, starting in two for th Jets. He reportedly has a hip injury that requires surgery.Osemele also filed an injury grievance.</p>
      <p>The Jets have not released a statement onEnunwa's complaints.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> Jets coach Adam Gase was asked about the tweets during his Friday morning press conference and took a minor jab at the injured receiver.</p>
      <p>"We handle our stuff in-house, and some people choose to use social media,"gase said. "There's probably a reason they're doing that."</p>
