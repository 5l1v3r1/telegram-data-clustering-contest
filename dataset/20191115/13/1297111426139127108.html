      <p>Saskatchewan Roughriders defensive tackle Micah Johnson wants to show his true colours in the West final.</p>
      <p>The former Calgary Stampeders star has embraced the Green and White after signing a free-agent contract in the off-season and helping Saskatchewan dethrone his former club <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-cody-fajardo-vows-to-be-ready-for-west-final">en route to the best record in the division (13-5)</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m definitely proud to be part of this group,” said Johnson, 31, a three-time CFL all-star. “I’m glad this is the place I chose in free agency. You get a bunch of guys like this who want it, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that it’s happening.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-wish-the-best-for-zach-collaros-except-on-sunday">The biggest test so far comes Sunday in the West final against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers at Mosaic Stadium</a>. The Riders need a victory to reach the Grey Cup for the first time since 2013, when they beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 45-23 at old Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>Johnson hopes for a similar end to his <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/micah-johnsons-contributions-measured-by-more-than-sacks-with-saskatchewan-roughriders">first season with the club</a> after helping Calgary win last year’s championship.</p>
      <p>“The difference is where you’re doing it,” Johnson noted. “This is a football town. I feel like this is the only province that football is king. (Everywhere else) it’s hockey first. To win here would be even more special.”</p>
      <p>Johnson brings a championship pedigree from the Stampeders, who appeared in the last three Grey Cups. Saskatchewan advanced to the 2013 league final at the expense of Calgary, prevailing 35-13 at McMahon Stadium.</p>
      <p>Johnson was a reluctant spectator for that game after suffering a torn ACL in a meaningless regular-season finale against the B.C. Lions. Without him and fellow defensive tackle Demonte Bolden, Riders tailback Kory Sheets gashed the Stamps for 177 yards on the ground.</p>
      <p>“They came out and pounded us,” Johnson recalled. “That was one of the hardest things I had to do was watch. Not being arrogant in the least, but just understanding the impact you have on the game. It was a direct correlation. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure it out.</p>
      <p>“That one hurt a lot.”</p>
      <p>Johnson’s club responded by reaching the Grey Cup in four of the next five seasons, winning it twice. Johnson is now looking to make his fourth straight appearance in the championship game.</p>
      <p>“It happened (in Calgary) because we came out and worked and we earned it,” he said. “We’re here right now because we came out and worked and earned it. You can’t lose sight of that. You don’t win just because you’ve been winning in the past.”</p>
      <p>Johnson hopes his big-game experience will benefit the Riders, who don’t have Calgary’s history of dominating the West. He’d like to help change that, but the wily veteran knows better than to look beyond Winnipeg toward a potential berth in the Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>“If it was to happen, it would be beautiful, but the road is so tough,” he added. “This is such a big game. It would almost be foolish to be thinking (past Sunday). I know it has to get done this week.”</p>
