      <h2>The girl, who is now seven, was starved of oxygen during her traumatic delivery at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital</h2>

      <p>A "remarkable" little girl who was born severely disabled at a Welsh hospital has won an NHS compensation package worth almost £18 million.</p>
      <p>The seven-year-old was starved of oxygen during her traumatic delivery at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in 2012 and will always need 24-hour care.</p>
      <p>Her mother suffered a ruptured uterus during the birth and the family's lawyers claimed her eventual caesarean delivery was negligently delayed.</p>
      <p>William Featherby QC, for the girl, told London's High Court that the Cwm Taf Health Board had admitted liability in full for her injuries.</p>
      <p>And, following negotiations, the board today agreed to a settlement of her claim which has a capitalised value of £17.9 million.</p>
      <p>Together with a £7.75 million lump sum, she will receive annual, index-linked and tax-free payments to cover the costs of her care for life.</p>
      <p>They will start at £92,000 a year, before rising to £155,000 a year in 2031, Judge Sarah Richardson was told.</p>
      <p>Mr Featherby told the court that the girl suffers from behavioural and learning difficulties and has almost no sense of danger.</p>
      <p>She is at high risk when crossing the road and is slow to react to pain, once suffering serious burns when she touched a hot metal plate.</p>
      <p>She can ride a tricycle if her feet are strapped to the pedals, but needs a buggy or electric wheelchair over distances of more than 100 yards.</p>
      <p>NHS counsel, Richard Booth QC, acknowledged that "no amount of money" could ever fully compensate the girl for her birth injuries.</p>
      <p>But he told the court: "On behalf of the board I would like to apologise wholeheartedly and unreservedly for the regrettable failings in care in this case.</p>
      <p>"I would also like to pay tribute to the parents for the outstanding care that they have given their daughter.</p>
      <p>"She is a remarkable girl who would not have made the progress she has without her parents' support."</p>
      <p>Approving the settlement, Judge Richardson said she was "more than satisfied" that the settlement was in the girl's best interests.</p>
