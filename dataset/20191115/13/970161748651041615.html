      <p>Public support for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> has been steadily growing throughout the week, according to an opinion polls average.</p>
      <p>The Tories have increased their lead from 34 to 40 per cent over the past two weeks as parties gear up for the December 12 General Election.</p>
      <p>Yesterday the December 12 election looked like it could be shaping into a two horse race as Jeremy Corbyn’s party was catching up with the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>But today Labour remained stagnant at 29 per cent while the Tories kept on making gains.</p>
      <p>It comes Boris Johnson said this morning that his party ‘have got to do better’ on the NHS after figures suggested the service’s performance is at its worst of all time.</p>

      <p>The Brexit Party was sitting at 12 per cent two weeks ago but has since plummeted to seven per cent.</p>
      <p>It comes as its leader Nigel Farage decided to stand down 317 candidates in Tory-held seats.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile support for the Green Party, whose members want a second EU referendum, has fallen from five to three per cent.</p>
      <p>In his first keynote General Election campaign speech this week, the Prime Minister promised a clean energy revolution, to put more money into the NHS and to help people cope with the cost of living.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Labour Party have promised <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/free-broadband-everyone-labour-win-general-election-11149349/">free broadband for all</a> by bringing parts of BT into public ownership if it wins.</p>
