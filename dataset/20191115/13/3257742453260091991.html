      <p><i>AppleInsider</i> staffers <a href="http://twitter.com/vmarks">Victor Marks</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/wgallagher">William Gallagher</a> discuss:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The MacBook Pro 16 is here! It's got a better keyboard, a better screen, better thermals, and more.</li>
        <li>Phil Schiller has taken to YouTube to talk about the keyboard, and reveals that they asked Pro users what they wanted out of a keyboard. Apple rarely admits to having asked anyone for product development feedback.</li>
        <li>Phil also suggested that Chromebooks are only good for testing in education settings, and if your student doesn't have an iPad, they won't succeed. This is a bad take.</li>
        <li>Senators investigate Goldman Sachs over possible gender discrimination in Apple Card issuance.</li>
        <li>Facebook fixes issue that activated the iPhone rear camera without the user's knowledge.</li>
        <li>Still more rumors about the "iPhone SE2" and iPad Pro, with expected launches in the first half of 2020.</li>
      </ul>
