      <p>The Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu has ordered the immediate redeployment of seven Commissioners of Police.</p>
      <p>They include acting CP Olusegun Odumosu who was posted to Lagos, Imohimi Edgal who is now the CP in charge of Ogun State command and Nkereuwem Akpan as CP, Cross River State.</p>
      <p>Others are Kenneth Ebrimson, Akwa Ibom State; Habu Ahmadu, Kano State; Lawal Jimeta, Edo State and Philip Maku, Bauchi State Command.</p>
      <p>The force spokesman, DCP Frank Mba in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, said the IG tasked the officers to ensure “the consolidation and improvement on the gains of their predecessors in the areas of public safety and crime-fighting.”</p>
      <p>Adamu also directed the new Commissioners of Police to work with relevant stakeholders in adopting “aggressive, proactive and community-based crime prevention strategies to combat crime in their areas of responsibility.”</p>
      <p>In addition, Adamu admonished the citizens of the affected states to accord the CPs maximum cooperation to ensure they succeeded in the realisation of their mandate.</p>
