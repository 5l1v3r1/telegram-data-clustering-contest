      <h1>Indiana judges suspended after 3 a.m. brawl at White Castle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:00:34+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>Three Indiana judges got in a fight. Two were injured, all were suspended. NPR's Laurel Wamsley reports "<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/14/779339897/3-indiana-judges-suspended-after-white-castle-brawl-that-left-2-of-them-wounded?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=nprnews">an incident brimming with colorful details.</a>"</p>
      <blockquote>The altercation apparently started sometime after 3 a.m., when one of the judges, Sabrina Bell, raised a middle finger at two men yelling from a passing SUV, and ended after one of those men shot two of the judges.<br/><br/>In between, the three judges took a number of actions that "discredited the entire Indiana judiciary," according to an opinion posted by the Indiana Supreme Court this week, suspending the judges.<br/><br/>The court found that the three — Andrew Adams, Bradley Jacobs and Sabrina Bell — had "engaged in judicial misconduct by appearing in public in an intoxicated state and behaving in an injudicious manner and by becoming involved in a verbal altercation." Adams and Jacobs engaged in further judicial misconduct "by becoming involved in a physical altercation for which Judge Adams was criminally charged and convicted."</blockquote>
      <p>The judges will be in the sin bin for two months. The shooter's been charged with felony aggravated battery.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> I <a href="https://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/11121901per.pdf">read the ruling</a> and it's fantastic, the reason we're here is because Judge Bell just stood there blabbing to the cops instead of <a href="https://www.popehat.com/2014/01/15/the-privilege-to-shut-up/">shutting the fuck up</a>.</p>
