      <h1>Week 11 Fantasy PPR RB Rankings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:03:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>The big question when compiling our Week 11 fantasy RB PPR rankings was what to do with David Johnson and Kenyan Drake. Johnson looked like a shell of himself as Drake doubled him in carries and received six more targets last week. Logicially, that should lead us to rank Drake over Johnson, right? Well, we're not out of a stubborn belief that Johnson will be better this week. Stupid? Perhaps, but name value goes a long way in fantasy football, even when it shouldn't. (<i>Update: We've come to our senses and moved Johnson down further after Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury commented on his health, or lack thereof.)</i></p>
      <p>But even if you prefer Johnson or Drake, neither is an exciting play this week against the 49ers. Drake put up big numbers against them just two weeks ago, but the odds of that happening again seem slim, especially with Johnson "healthy". Broncos backs Royce Freeman and Phillip Lindsay, both solid receivers, havesimilar matchups against Minnesota. You can play both as FLEXes, but neither seem quite worthy of RB2 status.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If you're looking for PPR-specific sleepers, James White (@Eagles),Kareem Hunt (vs. Steelers), Duke Johnson (@ Ravens), and Jaylen Samuels (@ Browns) are your top guys, and the usual crew of Tarik Cohen (@ Rams), Nyheim Hines (vs. Jaguars), etc. are in the mix, as well. J.D. McKissic is more interesting this week with Ty Johnson (concussion) ailing, while Hunt is almost a must-start after receiving 11 touches (four carries, seven catches) in his first game. Fantasy owners can't expect exactly the same results every week, but it's clear Cleveland wants to make sure of his talents.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 11 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1ink24648r3za1gkam0igv3ff9">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1k2ogltnjx2se1la6u4i3dbbtl">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Devonta Freeman (@ Panthers) is also in a good spot to rack up PPR points, but a foot injury could keep him out. That would leave Brian Hill as the primary runner and likely receiving back, though Kenjon Barner could also mix in and steal some catches. Either way, Hill will be a virtual must-start if Freeman misses time. (<i>Update: Freeman is expected to miss this week.)</i></p>
      <p>Another interesting PPR "sleeper" is Derrius Guice (vs. Jets), who's expected to see his first playing time since Week 1. Assuming he's fully recovered from his knee injury, Guice would likely handle some receiving-down work while splitting carries with Adrian Peterson. The talented second-year back had three catches on three targets in limited action in Week 1, so clearly he's capable of making plays out of the backfield.</p>

      <p>We had a couple PPR surprises in Week 10, with Ronald Jones (vs. Saints in Week 11) coming out of nowhere to catch all eight of his targets for 77 yards. Kalen Ballage (vs. Bills) also managed four catches in his new starting role. It only went for two yards, but it was nice to see Miami involve him in that part of the offense.</p>
