      <h1>Five more Indians open with 67</h1>
      <h2>Event curtailed to 54 holes; cut to be applied on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:41:06+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Rakesh-Rao-232/" target="_blank">Rakesh Rao</a></address>
      <p>The smog refused the give way to a brighter day. As a result, the scores on the second day of the Panasonic Open followed an expected pattern.</p>
      <p>The weather-hit event finally saw the completion of the first round, with no change on top of the leaderboard on Friday. Itthipat Buranatanyarat’s overnight two-stroke lead, at eight-under 64, remained unchallenged while Australia’s Terry Pilkadaris and Myanmar’s Ye Htet Aung joined Indonesia’s Danny Masrin in the second place, at 66.</p>
      <p>Among the Indians, Karandeep Kochhar, Kshitij Naveed Kaul, Vikrant Chopra, defending champion Khalin Joshi and Rashid Khan joined Shiv Kapur, Arjun Prasad, M. Dharma and Shankar Das at five-under 67 at the tied fifth spot. In fact, nine out of 11 professionals at five-under are Indians.</p>
      <p>Kaul, 18, playing his rookie season as a pro, fired a bogey-free round. Rashid, Chopra and Kochhar sank six birdies against a lone bogey while Joshi did it by finding seven birdies to offset two bogeys.</p>
      <p>Kaul, fourth on this season’s PGTI Order of Merit, was pleased with his hitting and putting, in spite of misreading a few putts. Interestingly, he made his pro debut in this event last year and finished sixth.</p>
      <h3>Summing it up</h3>
      <p>Rashid summed it up well. “I played solid and missed just one green today. I was four-under through nine holes and had a good chance of going low. But on the Hole No. 2, I misjudged the wind and landed my tee-shot in the bunker.”</p>
      <p>As anticipated, the $400,000 event stood reduced to a 54-hole event, with those making the ‘cut’ after Saturday’s second round, getting to play just one round to decide the winner.</p>
      <p>The Asian Tour confirmed this change and stated that the second round, to be played in two sessions on Saturday, will see a four-tee start — from the first, sixth, 10th and 15th holes.</p>
      <p><b>First-round scores:</b> 64 - Itthipat Buranatanyarat (Tha); 66 - Danny Masrin (Ina), Terry Pilkadaris (Aus), Ye Htet Aung (Mya); 67 - Karandeep Kochar, Arjun Prasad, Shiv Kapur, M. Dharma, Hung Chien-Yao (Tpe), Shankar Das, Vikrant Chopra, Khalin Joshi and Rashid Khan.</p>
      <p><b>Other leading Indians:</b> 68 - Sanjay Kumar, Aman Raj; 69 - Veer Ahlawat, Kapil Kumar, Viraj Madappa, Aadil Bedi, Arjun Atwal, Pravin Pathare; 70 - Sudhir Sharma, Shamim Khan, Om Prakash Chouhan, Honey Baisoya, Gaurav Pratap Singh and Jeev Milkha Singh.</p>
