      <h1>Russia, Lithuania and Norway conduct three-way spy swap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:06:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>A three-country spy swap between Russia, Lithuania and Norway has been conducted, officials say.</p>
      <p>It happened on Lithuania's border with Russia.</p>
      <p>Five people were freed as part of the operation on Friday, according to the head of Lithuania's counterintelligence.</p>
      <p>Two Russian nationals were exchanged for two Lithuanians and one Norwegian.</p>
      <p>It came after Lithuanian president, Gitanas Nausėda, confirmed earlier in the day that he had pardoned the two Russians — Nikolai Filipchenko and Sergei Moisejenko — that had been jailed for espionage since 2017.</p>
      <p>The former was serving a ten-year sentence after being found to be a member of Russia's FSB and for trying to recruit senior officials in Lithuania, while the latter was serving a sentence of ten years and six months for recruiting an officer.</p>
      <p>Nausėda's pardon of the two men on Friday cited a specific article in the country's criminal code that came into effect this week — and is in regard to an exchange process of foreign spies.</p>
      <p>According to Lithuania's BNS news service, it was the result of weeks of negotiations between Lithuania, Russia and Norway.</p>
      <p>In response, Russia released two Lithuanians — Yevgeny Mataitis and Aristidas Tamosaitis — who were jailed for spying in 2016.</p>
      <p>It also released Frode Berg, a Norwegian border guard who was convicted in 2017.</p>
      <p>His lawyer said an "exact time [was] not decided" on when Berg, who was handed over to Norwegian authorities in Lithuania, will be taken back to Norway.</p>
