      <p>If you've been planning to get a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/oneplus">OnePlus</a> device in the near future, you may want to wait for Black Friday. OnePlus has announced considerably <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-7-pro-7t-discounts-black-friday-deals_id120430">discounts</a> for both the OnePlus 6T and 7 Pro.</p>
      <p>Both of these smartphones will be discounted by $150, which a huge discount. We're not used to seeing such discounts from OnePlus to be quite honest, so this is a bit shocking.</p>
      <p>The OnePlus 6T and 7 Pro are not the latest smartphones from OnePlus, but the 7 Pro is almost as powerful as the company's current flagship. Both of these deals do seem compelling, but especially the one for the 7 Pro.</p>

      <h3>The OnePlus 6T &amp; 7 Pro discounts will come to play starting November 18</h3>
      <p>Prices of both of these devices will drop on November 18. The sale will last until December 2, and you'll be able to take advantage of it via OnePlus' official US website.</p>
      <p>OnePlus did note that the stock will be "very limited", reports Phone Arena. In other words, if you're planning to get one of those two phones, it may be wise to get them as soon as the sale starts.</p>
      <p>The sale will officially last until December 2, but we doubt that the stock will last that long. With a $150 discount on both devices, chances are that both will sell out fast.</p>

      <p>The OnePlus 6T usually costs $599, and it will be available for only $449 during this sale. That's not all, though, as you'll also get a case. No, we're not talking about the generic silicone case, but the Black Nylon Bumper case which is not cheap on its own.</p>
      <h3>The 7 Pro is a great deal at $549</h3>
      <p>The OnePlus 7 Pro will be available for only $549 during this sale, down from $699. Truth be said, this phone is now available for $649, but we're talking about its original price tag. Do note that we wrote $699 because this is an 8GB RAM variant with 256GB of storage we're talking about here. That is the only variant that is available in the US at the moment.</p>
      <p>OnePlus did not say when exactly will the sale kick off. We're presuming it will happen as soon as November 18 comes knocking. So, after midnight. That may not be accurate, though, OnePlus will probably release more info soon.</p>

      <p>The OnePlus 6T was announced back in October 2018, but it's still a great offering. The phone has really thin bezels, a tiny waterdrop notch, and it is fueled by the Snapdragon 845. It includes a 3,700mAh battery, and 20W fast battery charging.</p>
      <p>The OnePlus 7 Pro was introduced earlier this year, in May. it is fueled by the Snapdragon 855, and it comes with a pop-up selfie camera. The phone also has a curved display, and a 4,000mAh battery.</p>
      <p>Both of these OnePlus discounts are quite compelling, but we'd argue that the 7 Pro is the better deal. It'll be "only" $100 more expensive than the 6T (not counting the case), and it comes with a newer SoC, sleeker design, better display, and so on.</p>
