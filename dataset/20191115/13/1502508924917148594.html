      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/congress">Congress </a>on Friday attacked the Modi government over an official survey which reportedly points to a fall in consumer spending for the first time in four decades in 2017-18, with former party chief Rahul Gandhi saying that "Modinomics stinks so bad" the Centre has to hide its own reports.</p>
      <p>Party general secretary <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/priyanka-gandhi">Priyanka Gandhi </a>Vadra also took a swipe at the government, saying the Modi dispensation is making history by "driving people into poverty".</p>
      <p>A media report cited the latest consumption expenditure survey by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/politics-news-national-1550101.htm">National </a>Statistical Office (NSO) to claim that consumer spending fell for the first time in more than four decades in 2017-18, primarily driven by slackening rural demand.</p>
      <p>The report also claimed the NSO report was approved to be released on June 19 this year but was withheld by the government agency owing to its "adverse" findings.</p>
      <p>"Modinomics stinks so bad, the government has to hide its own reports," Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet, tagging the news report.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/priyanka-gandhi">Priyanka Gandhi </a>tweeted, "Consumer spending in India has collapsed. Successive governments have striven tirelessly to combat poverty and empower the people. This government is making history by driving people into poverty: while rural India faces the dire consequences of their policies, the BJP ensures that their corporate friends become richer by the day."<br/><br/><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/congress">Congress </a>spokesperson Pawan Khera said that the NSO report on Household Consumer Expenditure 2017-18, which has been leaked, shows the average amount of money spent by a person in a month fell by 3.7 per cent to Rs 1,446 in 2017-18 from Rs 1,501 in 2011-12.</p>
      <p>The most serious matter is that even the consumption of food has declined, Khera said.</p>
      <p>The economic situation of rural India, which is more than 60 per cent, is terrible, he claimed.</p>
