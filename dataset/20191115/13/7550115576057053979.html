        <b>Steven Gerrard has explained how <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/trent-alexander-arnold/">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> “stood out” to him as a youngster while he was working at Liverpool’s academy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold’s debut for the first team came before Gerrard’s return to the club as a youth coach, but he had already caught the former captain’s eye.</p>
      <p>Gerrard name-checked the right-back along with Herbie Kane in his 2015 autobiography as two players he ensured were with him for every session while he was working towards his UEFA B Licence.</p>
      <p>While Kane is still working his way through the ranks and will likely settle further down the Football League ladder in the near future, Alexander-Arnold recently made his 100th appearance for Liverpool.</p>
      <p>He is regularly praised for his attitude on and off the pitch, and Gerrard believes it was “more about character” for him as he progressed.</p>
      <p>“I was lucky to have a few days around Trent during his academy days and he stood out,” Gerrard told <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steven-gerrard-key-attribute-made-17257067">the <i>Liverpool Echo</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“Of course people always talk about his technique and the stuff they see, but I saw something in this kid that was more about character.</p>
      <p>“So talent will get you to a certain place, but I seen that he had the fight, the desire and commitment and that is what will keep him there consistently throughout what will hopefully be a long career.</p>
      <p>“The talent is so obvious but I saw something different in him and it was more to do with the character and that is the reason why he is where he is.”</p>

      <p>Of course, “where he is” is first-choice right-back for the European champions and half of the best full-back partnership in world football; all at just 21.</p>
      <p>Gerrard believes he and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a> are in the “world-class bracket,” and speaking on Alexander-Arnold in particular, the Rangers manager insisted he can “be whatever he wants to be.”</p>
      <p>“It’s not a question of ‘how good can he be?’ because he is already there,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“What we have in Trent and Robbo now, straight away, you would put them in the world-class bracket.</p>
      <p>“They are up there with the best players in their position, worldwide. So there’s no point saying how good could they be because they are already there.</p>

      <p>“The thing for Trent now is can he maintain that consistency for as long as he can? Because he can go on and be whatever he wants to be.”</p>
      <p>It is still difficult to project where Alexander-Arnold’s future will take him, with many believing he will establish himself as a central midfielder in the future—but he could convincingly become the world’s best right-back.</p>
      <p>Maintaining consistency is key, and though it is hard to imagine the No. 66 dropping off now, he will be well-served to retain his determined attitude if he is to follow in Gerrard’s footsteps as Liverpool captain.</p>
