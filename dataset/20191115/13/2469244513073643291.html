      <h2>Last night's episode of Rich Kids Go Skint followed Devon, as she went to stay with the Gibbins family, who are a lot less well off than herself</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:16:12+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author">Jess Morcom</a></address>
      <p>A loaded trainee solicitor from Exeter has hit back at online trolls who branded her 'thick as sh**' after her appearance on Rich Kids Go Skint.</p>
      <p>Last night's episode followed Devon, as she swapped her pampered lifestyle and parents mega-mansion for life with a debt-ridden family of five in Lincoln.</p>
      <p>Devon is used to receiving a £500 monthly allowance from her parents, who also pay her bills - and they bail her out if she is every short of cash.</p>
      <p>Not only does she spend a lot on designer items, from Gucci and Louis Vuitton bags to £800 on a designer coat, but she also pays out £100 a week on takeaways.</p>
      <p>She lives in a mansion the size of three small houses which has an incredible 12 bathrooms - three of which are just for her.</p>
      <p>And last night, she received the shock of her life when she went to stay with the Gibbins family.</p>
      <p>Paul and Sammie have three young kids and survive on a combined salary and benefits of £1,730 a month.</p>
      <p>After bills, childcare and food, they have a little over £50 for the rest of the month.</p>
      <p>They are also in £3,000 worth of debt.</p>

      <p>Despite Devon's efforts to adapt to the Gibbins' lifestyle, by helping fix a bathroom door, going hunting for clothes and gifts in a charity shop and even attempting to cook a meal for the family, viewers were left in shock by the contrast between the two lifestyles.</p>
      <p>Some took to Twitter, to challenge Devon on her efforts.</p>
      <p>"How do you turn the hob on?!," one wrote.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, her parents have got a lot to answer for, they should be embarassed #RichKidsGoSkint.</p>
      <p>Another said: "100k on her "education" and still tick as pig s**t #RichKidsGoSkint"</p>

      <p>Devon took to her Twitter page to respond to some comments, writing: "I'm a a Russell group uni studying Law, can speak fluent French and on course to get a training contract and go straight into a 40k+ starting salary job. Hbu Darren without a picture."</p>
      <p>Another viewer also wrote a comment referring to Devon as being 'out of touch' compared to others that have been on the show.</p>
      <p>"She didn't seem to have much in the way of social skills or charisma," they said.</p>
      <p>"why on earth would you imply or question that a family who can't afford organic chicken don't care about the welfare of the animal or the environment - when she herself is the personification of inflated consumerism."</p>

      <p>Devon quickly hit back:</p>
      <p>"You see about 40 minutes out of about 40 hours of filming. Awkward at the start? Yes, as I'd never met the family. I never implied that they don't care - not mentioned the organic - simply asked if they'd consider eating less meat for the environment as it's actually cheaper."</p>
      <p>During the course of the programme, Devon came to understand how the Gibbins' family live.</p>
      <p>"When I saw how much the family had to budget it was quite eye-opening," she said.</p>
      <p>"I don't have to think about how much I have left for the week. It's very hard what they have to do."</p>
      <p>And by the end of the programme, she was sad to say goodbye to the Gibbins family, who she said were all 'so nice'.</p>
      <p>"I loved the time I spent with the family," she said.</p>
      <p>"I think I'll take away the fact that I am very lucky, and I need to appreciate that a bit more and realise that not everyone is lucky enough to live the way I live.</p>
      <p>"It's kinda sad to leave the family, they're all so nice. It was really opening to see how other people live."</p>
