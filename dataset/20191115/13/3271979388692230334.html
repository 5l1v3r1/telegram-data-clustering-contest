      <p><b>Caitlyn Jenner</b> announced that she was going to be a mom to a new baby at her birthday dinner? That’s the ludicrous claim from one tabloid this week. <b>Gossip Cop</b> looked into the story and found it false.</p>
      <p>The <b><i>National Enquirer</i></b> claims Jenner “stunned” her family at her 70th birthday party last month by boldly declaring: “I’m going to be a mom!” According to “insiders,” the former Olympian announced her plan to add another member to the family at her birthday dinner, which was attended by her family and close friends. The tabloid’s narrative is that Jenner is “desperate” to keep her “live-in love,” 23-year-old Lumasol CEO Sophia Hutchins, happy. Despite Jenner “spoiling” her “with a lavish lifestyle,” the outlet says, Hutchins won’t be content until she and Jenner have a child together.</p>
      <p>“Being a mom at 70 is not something Caitlyn ever thought she’d want,” a source says, “but she’d do anything for Sophia.” We don’t mean to be pedantic, but we do want to point out here that Caitlyn is already a mother of six biological children. That being said, none of them were born when Jenner was 70, so we’ll let the imprecise language go this time.</p>
      <p>The publication then claims that Hutchins, “the cradle-robber’s constant companion,” helped Jenner through her issues with her biological and former step-children, but Hutchins has now upset the Jenner and Kardashian kids with this bold next step. Jenner’s family, according to “sources,” aren’t exactly able to process the “baby bombshell” and “haven’t completely accepted young Sophia’s place” in Jenner’s life. “The fact is Caitlyn’s not getting any younger,” the anonymous insider concludes. “She’s had plenty of experience having kids — but she may not be able to pick one up anymore!”</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> ran the claims by Jenner’s spokesperson, someone who’s actually able to provide legitimate insight into the former Olympian’s life. Her rep is going on the record with us to state that this was just another false story about Jenner. There’s no truth to it.</p>
      <p>To clarify, both Jenner and Hutchins have denied that there’s any sort of romance between them. The two do in fact live together, but they refer to one another as a more of a partner in business and in life. The outlet never gives any reason to believe there’s anything more to it than that.</p>
      <p>This is just the latest of the <i>Enquirer</i>’s nonsensical stories about Jenner and Hutchins. <b>Gossip Cop</b> called the tabloid out in June for incorrectly claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/caitlyn-jenner-sophia-hutchins-summer-wedding-calling-off/">Jenner and Hutchins were putting off their summer wedding</a> — a wedding that never existed in the first place. The outlet published a similar tale in February about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/caitlyn-jenner-sophia-hutchins-plastic-surgery-wedding/">Jenner getting plastic surgery before she married Hutchins</a>. Considering that it’s been months since those articles came out, it’s clear the tabloid’s claims are consistently baseless and inaccurate.</p>
