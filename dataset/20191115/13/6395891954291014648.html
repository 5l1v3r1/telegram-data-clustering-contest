      <p>While Apple is touting the latest iPhones that will hold your entire life in your pocket, Motorola is reintroducing a classic that was at one point only a phone.</p>
      <p>The company announced it is bringing back the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/products/razr">Razr flip phone</a> this week. </p>

      <p>The phone, which was introduced way back in 2004, was thin, had a blue back-lit metal keypad and was the best-selling phone until iPhone knocked it off the pedestal, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/motorola-razr-review/index.html">CNN reported</a>. </p>
      <p>While the phone is called a <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/products/razr">Razr</a>, it isn't just a phone anymore. </p>
      <p>It actually is a smartphone that has a folding 6.2-inch screen when open, and 2.7-inch when closed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/technology/motorola-razr-foldable-phone.html">The New York Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The phone can show the time, take selfies and do quick respond texts when closed but most of the functions have to have the phone flipped open, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/motorola-razr-review/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/products/razr">The Razr</a> runs Android 9, available only on Verizon by preorder and comes at a cost of almost $1,500, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/motorola-razr-review/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>
