      <p>Princess Nokia has a new album that she’s expecting to release in the first half of 2020, and she discussed it in a new <a href="https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/princess-nokia-new-album-sugar-honey-iced-tea-balenciaga-interview-2567565">interview with NME</a>. Here’s an excerpt of what she says about it:</p>
      <blockquote>I’ve got a hip-hop and soul record coming out, and it’s incredible. It’s probably my best work I’ve ever made so far, which will only last ‘til the next one after that.<br/><br/>It’s a really well composed, thought-out brilliantly musical project. I go back to hip-hop, acoustic, R’nB, soul, and there’s some Latin music on it. These lyrics are from the pages of my diary. It’s the diary of a young girl going through heartbreak, loss, betrayal, fame, insecurities, doubt, boundaries, self-care, and more than anything, healing. Healing as a young girl at the start of womanhood. Healing and being honest with everything that I’m feeling and experiencing, and bringing it into poetic light and making it very powerful.<br/><br/>I know that it’s going to make a lot of women cry. This is just a little taste of it.</blockquote>

The album is set to feature her excellent recent single <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/princess-nokia-returns-with-awesome-new-song-video-sugar-honey-iced-tea/">“Sugar Honey Iced Tea,”</a> and the just-released, harder, darker single “Balenciaga.” Listen to that one and watch its video (which, in case you’re at work, features censored-but-still-probably-NSFW nudity) below.</p>
      <p>Princess Nokia also has a meet-and-greet pop-up in NYC today (11/15) at Depop (168 Mott St) from 5-7 PM. She also made her acting debut in the Peter Lee-directed <i>Angelfish</i>, which premiered at NYC’s United Palace Theater last night and comes to streaming services on Tuesday (11/19).</p>
