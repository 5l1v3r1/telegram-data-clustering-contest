      <h1>Amazon challenges Pentagon's US$10-billion cloud award to Microsoft</h1>
      <h2>AWS CEO says bias needs to be rectified.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:23:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/jeffrey-dastin-and-david-shepardson-1282863" target="_blank">Jeffrey Dastin and David Shepardson</a></address>
      <p>Amazon on Thursday said it is contesting the Pentagon's award of an up to USUS$10 billion cloud computing deal to Microsoft Corp , expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process.</p>
      <p>The company filed notice last Friday that it will formally protest the decision on the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, known as JEDI.</p>
      <p>In a company-wide meeting on Thursday, Amazon Web Services' CEO Andy Jassy said it would be challenging for a US agency to award a contract objectively when the president is disparaging one of the contestants, according to an Amazon spokesman.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump has long criticised Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos.</p>
      <p>The company confirmed Jassy's comments and said, "Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias- and itâ€™s important that these matters be examined and rectified."</p>
      <p>The Federal Times earlier reported the news.</p>
      <p>A challenge to the Defense Department's award announced last month was widely expected by legal experts, analysts and consultants, especially after Trump publicly derided Amazon's bid for the high-stakes contract.</p>
      <p>Trump had said in August that Amazon's bid for the JEDI contract was under review by his administration after complaints from other companies.</p>
      <p>Amazon was considered a favourite for the contract, part of a broader digital modernisation process of the Pentagon, before Microsoft emerged as the surprise winner.</p>
