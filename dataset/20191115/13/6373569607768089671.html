      <h1>Plymouth has its first four star boutique hotel</h1>
      <h2>The Invicta Hotel has undergone a huge refurbishment, which has earned four star accreditation as the first boutique hotel in the city</h2>

      <p>A hotel in Plymouth has become the first four star boutique hotel in the city - after it was accredited its latest star by the AA this year.</p>
      <p>The Invicta Hotel on Lockyer Street is run by Roy Martin and his family, who took over the premises in 2002.</p>
      <p>At the time, it was trading as a two star hotel, achieving a three star rating in 2009.</p>
      <p>Ten years later and the establishment has finally earned its fourth star, officially trading as a four star accredited boutique hotel since September.</p>
      <p>A boutique hotel is a small hotel which typically has between 10 and 100 rooms in unique settings with "upscale accommodations and individualised selling points".</p>
      <p>The Invicta Hotel and Restaurant describes itself as 'a luxury hotel in the heart of Britain's Ocean City', characterised by its intimate atmosphere and individualised hospitality along with an unparalleled gastronomical experience in the restaurant.</p>
      <p>As a grade two listed building, the hotel also boasts being Plymouth's oldest lodging house daring back to 1852.</p>
      <p>"About two or three years ago we realised Plymouth was lacking in a small, boutique four star hotel," Roy said.</p>

      <p>"Other hotels are on corporate level, but we thought Plymouth needed something more specialised.</p>
      <p>"We moved here about 16 years ago after selling our family home in Lincoln and although the hotel was still trading it was virtually derelict when we took over, so its been a massive investment.</p>
      <p>"In 2017, knowing the Mayflower 400 was on the horizon, we decided to give our guests that something extra, so for the last two and a half years, we have been working towards creating a new look Invicta hotel, going from a three star accredited hotel to a four star boutique hotel with accreditation from the AA."</p>
      <p>The AA has been classifying hotels using their rating system since 1912, and hotels are awarded classification on a scale of one to five stars, with five being the very best.</p>
      <p>"Our new signature rooms were developed in partnership with South West Shop fitters," Roy continued.</p>
      <p>"Each room is a different shape and size so bedroom furniture and fitments are all bespoke and hand made to suit individual rooms.</p>
      <p>"Even though the hotel is more than 200 years old we wanted to meet the demands of the 21st century too, so all our rooms are equipped with multiple charging devices and connection points, fibre optic broadband and LED mood lighting in the signature rooms."</p>
      <p>Despite the huge investment Roy has put into The Invicta, he still says there is more to come.</p>

      <p>"Sadly, the hotel was heavily damaged during the second world war and we're still finding damage to mouldings outside, so we are working closely with English Heritage and conversation people to hopefully do an outside revamp of all the mouldings and bring the building back to its former glory.</p>
      <p>"We're hoping to market to the Americans that will be visiting our city next year, we already do very well on the Italian, Spanish, German and Austrian tours.</p>
      <p>"But, on the other hand we don't just want to be known as a hotel for coach trips a couple of times a year, we want to open the hotel up to our British guests as well."</p>

      <p>As well as a refurbishment, Roy and his team have created a new dining experience at the Bowline restaurant, as part of the hotel.</p>
      <p>"We've always had a restaurant here, but we've never really opened it to the general public," Roy said.</p>
      <p>"It would be nice to promote the restaurant more now and get that off the ground.</p>
      <p>"It is now led by a very talented new head chef, Kristofer Blyth, who joined the hotel after working as a chef in the House of Lords in London, so 2020 will hopefully see that moving forward.</p>
      <p>"We've already got some fantastic eateries in Plymouth, but there's always room for one more, and the name is attached to The Invicta Hotel, so it will be exciting to see what will happen."</p>
      <p>The Bowline Restaurant website has an exciting à la carte menu running from Thursday to Saturday. </p>
      <p>The Invicta Hotel also runs its own Lounge Menu available from Monday to Saturday.  The restaurant and bar are open to non-residents.</p>
