      <h1>Siren scores $10 million Series A for its investigative intelligence platform and new deep tech extension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:00:47+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tech.eu/author/annelise-musgrove/" target="_blank">Annie Musgrove</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://siren.io/">Siren</a>, the Irish platform for data intelligence and cybersecurity, has raised a $10 million Series A led by Atlantic Bridge. The round also includes DVI Equity Partners, Frontline Ventures, and Enterprise Ireland, the Irish government agency responsible for the development of Irish enterprises in world markets. <br/><br/>The Galway-based startup continues to develop its platform for data intelligence and investigation, which attracted <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/siren-funding/">€3 million in funding last year</a>. Indeed, along with the Series A, the company has announced a new deep technology called “Federate,” for which it has just filed several patents.<br/><br/>Co-founder and Chief Product Officer Dr. Giovanni Tummarello explained the value of the technology: “Siren stands at the forefront of augmented analytics, the new wave of analytics in which AI techniques give analysts unprecedented powers of investigation. In Siren, techniques like knowledge graph/link analysis, entity resolution, search, natural language processing and predictive analytics seamlessly come together in a single UI. Siren is easy to deploy and leverages data directly on backends such as Elasticsearch, relational databases, virtual data warehouses and graph databases.”<br/><br/>CEO John Randles said: “The demand for investigative intelligence and large-scale interconnected data analysis is constantly accelerating. Our platform uniquely enables this in real-time at a scale that companies and government organizations require. In this sector it is critical to not only raise funds, but also to have the right wealth of experience. For this reason, we’re delighted to have Bob Griffin join the board.”<br/><br/>Currently with DVI Equity Partners, Griffin is a veteran of intelligence and law enforcement software and former CEO of i2, which was acquired by IBM to become the world’s most deployed intelligence and law enforcement software.<br/><br/>Griffin commented: “We believe Siren is a pioneer in a market that is about to explode. We are pleased to support their ongoing success and become part of a journey that will see investigative intelligence technologies shape the future direction of law enforcement, cyber security and financial fraud.”</p>
      <p>Gerry Maguire of Atlantic Bridge remarked on how the investment will propel the business forward: “The latest round of funding will enable Siren to further develop its proposition and expand into new markets, consolidating its position as an industry leader. Siren is revolutionizing the augmented analytics field, creating unprecedented value especially for organizations with large real-time data.”</p>
