      <h1>How Nottingham parents can have their say on changing school preferences and catchment areas</h1>
      <h2>There are two proposals to have your say on</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:46:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Reid</a></address>
      <p>Parents in Nottingham are being asked to give their thoughts on changes to school choices and catchment areas through a survey - and this is how to do it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-council">Nottingham City Council</a> has proposed to reduce the preferences parents can make for primary schools from six choices to four.</p>
      <p>The council is also planning on changing the catchment areas for two city schools - Fernwood Primary and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/plans-41m-expansion-primary-school-1369508">Middleton Primary</a>, both in Wollaton.</p>
      <p>The catchment changes have been prompted by new housing estates that have been developed nearby, to ensure there are enough places for people who move in.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">schools</a> have received government funding to expand their intakes to deal with demand.</p>
      <p>The catchment area of Middleton Primary will be changed to include a new 110 housing development on Woodyard Lane.</p>
      <p>Another change will include moving the area of Tom Blower Close from the Fernwood catchment to the Middleton catchment.</p>
      <p>The Fernwood catchment will include a new development on the Radford Bridge allotment site.</p>
      <p>No further changes to the arrangements are proposed.</p>
      <p>These arrangements are for pupils who will be starting school for the first time in the 2021 autumn term, or changing from one school to another between September 2021 and July 2022.</p>
