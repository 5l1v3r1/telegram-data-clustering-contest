      <p>MBOMBELA – The bail application of Bina Mfandifuna Masuku (44), the former master of the High Court in Mpumalanga, and Elvis Kgosiemang (35) continued in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>During their formal bail application, which started on Wednesday, the state opposed bail on the basis that the accused had misrepresented themselves.</p>
      <p>The two were arrested last week in connection with defrauding the public of money from deceased estates amounting to R1,7 million.</p>
      <blockquote>Several complaints were lodged by victims claiming that Masuku allegedly directed beneficiaries of estates to her boyfriend to process their claims.</blockquote>
      <p>Kgosiemang is alleged to have transferred estate money to a trust and used it for his personal benefit.</p>
      <p>Beneficiaries of the money could not get access to money that had been left to them by their deceased relatives.</p>
      <p>They were since charged with fraud, corruption and money laundering. Masuku was also separately charged with contravention of the Illegal Immigration Act.</p>

      <p>Masuku, a Malawian national, is said to have misled the state by claiming to be a South African citizen.</p>
      <p>It is also alleged that she submitted false documents to the Department of Justice when applying for a job.</p>
      <p>The state also said the payments made to her while working for the department were under investigation.</p>
      <blockquote>The Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services issued a statement on Tuesday November 12, confirming that Masuku had been dismissed by the department.</blockquote>
      <p>The attorney for the accused, Dimakatso Mashego, reading the affidavit by Masuku, said she and Kgosiemang were no longer a couple, although they are living in one house.</p>
      <p>Kgosiemang is renting a room in the house in which Masuku lives. Their relationship had ended in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mashego said that Masuku was born in South Africa and left for Malawi when she was in standard two, and returned when she was in standard 10.</p>
      <p>She got her documents when she was a minor with the help of her parents.</p>
      <p>The bail hearing is set to resume next week Thursday and Friday.</p>
