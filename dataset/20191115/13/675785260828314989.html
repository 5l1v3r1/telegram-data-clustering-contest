      <p>Donald Trump must pay £225,000 to the Scottish government after losing a legal battle over a wind farm near his hotel.</p>
      <p>The US President mounted a legal challenge against the 11-turbine wind farm claiming it would spoil the view from Trump International Golf Links.</p>
      <p>The wind farm in Aberdeen Bay started operating last summer and is visible from the greens at the resort in Balmedie.</p>
      <p>His case was dismissed at the UK Supreme Court four years ago but now Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd has been told to pay £225,000 in legal fees to Scottish ministers.</p>

      <p>A Scottish government spokesman said: “We can confirm that settlement has now been reached – and this has removed the need for the expenses to be determined by the auditor of the Court of Session.</p>
      <p>“Expenses amounting to £225,000 will now be paid to Scottish ministers by the petitioners.”</p>
      <p>The Trump organisation sued the Scottish government to try and block the wind farm during the planning application process.</p>

      <p>Trump branded it a "monstrous" project and said the wind farm would destroy the view of “perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world”.</p>
      <p>Planning approval was granted in 2013 and the Vattenfall’s European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre began operating last year.</p>
      <p>Trump lost his appeal twice in the Scottish courts and took it to the Supreme Court where his case was unanimously dismissed.</p>
