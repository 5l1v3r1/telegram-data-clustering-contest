      <p>Good news for Egg McMuffin lovers.</p>
      <p>McDonalds has announced that it is extending its opening hours to 11am across every Irish restaurant.</p>
      <p>This means that from next Wednesday, breakfast-goers will have an extra thirty minutes to grab something before the menu switches to its usual daytime selection of burgers and nuggets.</p>
      <p>McDonalds said it made the decision after listening to customer feedback.</p>
      <p>Vice President of Food and Marketing at McDonald's UK and Ireland Michelle Graham-Clare said: “We all understand the pain of missing out on a McMuffin by a matter of minutes.</p>
      <p>"We have listened to our customers’ pleas and are delighted to extend breakfast serving time until 11am, particularly as we head into the festive season when we see a rush of latecomers searching for those all-important hash browns.”</p>
      <p>UberEats orders will be extending from 10:15am to 10:45am.</p>
