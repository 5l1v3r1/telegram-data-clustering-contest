      <h1>Fantasy Injury Updates: George Kittle, Gerald Everett, Jack Doyle impact Week 11 TE rankings</h1>

      <p>George Kittle was ruled out for Week 11, only to have the 49ers backtrack and say he's not officially out...yet. It's time to pick up Ross Dwelley from the free agent pool, fantasy owners. The tight end rankings will also be affected by the injury status of Gerald Everett and Jack Doyle (who's more important for how he affects Eric Ebron's value). We have the latest news and updates on these TEs below.</p>

      <h3>Will George Kittle play in Week 11?</h3>
      <p>Kyle Shanahan said Wednesday "we won't have Kittle," but then the 49ers later announced through a spokesperson that Kittle <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbarrows/status/1194784350237118465">hasn't been ruled out</a> for Week 11. If he misses out, which still looks likely, Ross Dwelley would get the start against the Cardinals.</p>
      <p>Considering how bad Arizona is at covering tight ends, Dwelley should start in every fantasy league. He's nearlyunowned in nearly every league still, so pick him up.</p>

      <h3>Gerald Everett injury update</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Rams coach Sean McVay said he "<a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyThiry/status/1195098455556993025">expects</a>" Everett to play this week.</p>
      <p>Everett <a href="https://twitter.com/caplannfl/status/1194769205792509954">was limited in Wednesday's practice</a> due to a wrist injury. His Thursday and Friday practice status will be more telling. Ideally he's fine so there's no question mark heading into the Rams' Sunday night game against the Bears.</p>
      <p>With Brandin Cooks out in Week 10, Everett had 12 targets, catching eight. He'll continue to be heavily featured in the L.A. offense as long as he's active in Week 11 and should be in fantasy lineups despite a decent Chicago defense.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Jack Doyle injury news</h3>
      <p>Doyle (shoulder) <a href="https://twitter.com/Colts/status/1194721018750918656">missed Wednesday's practice</a>. He was outsnapped for the first time this season in Week 10 by Eric Ebron, and now his status for Week 11 is in doubt.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Update: Doyle returned to practice Thursday.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ebron is a surefire TE1 if you take Doyle out of the way, so this is more about Ebron than Doyle, at least for fantasy purposes. If Jacoby Brissett is back and Doyle is out, you can feel good about playing Ebron in Week 11.</p>
