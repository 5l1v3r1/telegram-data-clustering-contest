      <p>A typical security camera can give you peace of mind. But that might be offset by the nagging feeling that it's watching <i>you</i>, too.</p>
      <p>The best kind of security system is one that protects both your home and your privacy, and the <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/blurams-dome-pro-1080p-security-camera-w-facial-recognition-night-vision?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blurams-dome-pro-1080p-security-camera-w-facial-recognition-night-vision&amp;utm_term=scsf-346649&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MrkG&amp;scsonar=1">blurams Dome Pro 1080p Security Camera</a> is one rare model that's set up to do both.</p>
      <p>The HD lens on the blurams is equipped with a 360º field of vision, and it can be set to record any preset area with an Auto-Cruise mode. All footage is uploaded to the cloud, and you can choose to get alerts on any unauthorized motion or human detection - even in the dimmest conditions, thanks to the night vision functionality. You can even record your own alert video.</p>
      <p>But all the while, you get to decide what areas get recorded and who sets off alerts. The blurams' voice and facial recognition technology can distinguish between pets or authorized family members to avoid false alarms. Want to keep some privacy? The camera can even be set to cover up and shut down when it detects you. You can even set up your own house-wide security system and view up to four cameras on the accompanying app.</p>
      <p>Right now, the blurams Dome Pro 1080p Security Camera with Facial Recognition + Night Vision is <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/blurams-dome-pro-1080p-security-camera-w-facial-recognition-night-vision?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blurams-dome-pro-1080p-security-camera-w-facial-recognition-night-vision&amp;utm_term=scsf-346649&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MrkG&amp;scsonar=1">16% off the regular MSRP</a>, but you can take an extra 15% off that final price by using the <b>online code BFSAVE15</b>, for a final price of $42.49.</p>
