      <p>The West African Examinations Council on Friday released the results of 91, 225 private candidates that sat for the 2019 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The Head of the Nigeria National Office of WAEC, Mr. Olu Adenipekun, in a statement said that a total of 97,080 candidates registered for the examination in Nigeria, out of which 94,884 candidates sat the examination.</p>
      <p>Adenipekun said out of the 94,884 candidates that sat the examination, 91,225 candidates, representing 96.14 per cent have their results fully processed and released while 3,659 candidates representing 3.86 per cent have a few of their subjects still being processed.</p>
      <p>The Head of the Nigeria National Office of WAEC also disclosed that of the total number of candidates that sat the examination in Nigeria, 47,237 were male while 47,647 were female, representing 49.78 per cent and 50.22 per cent respectively.</p>
      <p>“A total of 9,457 candidates representing 9.74 per cent were reported to have been involved in examination malpractices and their cases would be presented to the appropriate Committee of Council for appropriate action. The Council’s decision will be communicated to the affected candidates within the shortest possible time. The Council in Nigeria had perfected its Electronic Certificate Management System, an online portal being deployed to enable private candidates to request their certificates online.</p>
      <p>“Beginning with the WASSCE for Private Candidates, 2019-Second Series, the collection of certificates would be based on requests by candidates online via the Electronic Certificate Management System platform. Candidates who sat for the examination have been asked to check the details of their performance on the Council’s results website: <a href="http://www.waecdirect.org/">www.waecdirect.org</a>,” Adenipekun said.</p>
