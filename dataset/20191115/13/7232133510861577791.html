      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After trading to a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/15/bitcoin-btc-in-slow-and-steady-decline-8-2k-likely-target/">new monthly low at $8,457</a>, bitcoin started an upside correction against the US Dollar. BTC climbed above the $8,550 and $8,600 resistance levels to start the current correction.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,785 high to $8,457 low. Finally, there was a spike above the $8,650 resistance area.</p>
      <p>However, the upward move was capped by the $8,700 resistance the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, morning’s major declining channel is preventing gains near $8,705 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Besides, it seems like the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,785 high to $8,457 low is also acting as a strong resistance.</p>
      <p>If there is a clear break above the channel resistance, $8,720, and the 100 hourly SMA, the price is likely to continue to higher. The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/14/bitcoin-btc-price-poised-for-declines-unless-it-breaks-9k/">next key resistance</a> is near the $8,780 level. The main resistance is still near the $8,880 level and a connecting bearish trend line on the same chart.</p>
      <p>Above $8,880, bitcoin is likely to continue to higher towards $9,000 and $9,250. Conversely, the price might fail to continue above $8,780 or $8,880. In the mentioned case, the $8,550 level is likely to provide support in the near term.</p>
      <p>If the price struggles to hold the $8,550 support area, there are high chances of another break below $8,500 or even $8,450. The next major support is near the $8,300 and $8,200 levels.</p>
