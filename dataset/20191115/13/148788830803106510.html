      <p>First up, this time lapse video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79dOhtRG-ck&amp;feature=emb_title">Pixar Animation</a> shows off the hustle and bustle of an entire day of activity at the animation studio’s campus in Emeryville, California. The video stays in the more public areas of the campus during production of Toy Story 4, so unfortunately you don’t get to see what’s going on in the offices of the various animators and filmmakers, but it’s a cool glimpse from inside the studio if you’ve never been before.</p>

      <p>Next up, a video essay from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KOsM5Xfe_E&amp;feature=emb_title">Patrick (H) Willems</a> takes an in-depth look at the trailers for all three installments of the new Star Wars trilogy to illustrate how the Lucasfilm marketing team has weaponized nostalgia. It requires using a bit of the old, a bit of the new, treating every bit of footage as precious, and making sure audiences feel like they <i>need</i> to see this movie. But how do these trailers accomplish that?</p>

      <p>Finally, <i>Game of Thrones</i> and <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i> actress Emilia Clarke can currently be seen in the holiday romantic comedy <i>Last Christmas</i>. That’s the perfect time for her to sit down to take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGE71YTSGt8&amp;feature=emb_title">Vanity Fair</a>‘s lie detector test interview. How many instruments can she play? Was her first job being a birthday party princess? Has she seen all of the <i>Star Wars</i> movies?</p>
