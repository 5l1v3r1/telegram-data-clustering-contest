      <p>Small tsunamis of less than 1 meter have been recorded in cities of North Sulawesi and North Maluku after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake jolted areas in the two provinces at midnight on Thursday, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has said.</p>
      <p>Tsunamis of up to 0.6 meters and 0.9 meters were recorded in North Maluku’s Ternate and Jailolo, respectively, less than 30 minutes after the quake hit the region at 11:17 p.m., according to the BMKG.</p>
      <p>In Bitung, North Sulawesi, tsunami waves with a height of 0.1 meters occurred less than one hour following the earthquake, which was also felt in North Sulawesi’s capital of Manado and Gorontalo, among other places.</p>
      <p>Along with the earthquake ─ the epicenter of which was located about 134 northwest of Jailolo, in the sea bordering the two provinces ─ the BMKG also issued a tsunami early warning for North Sulawesi and North Maluku.</p>
      <p>Although the main shock was followed by dozens of aftershocks, the BMKG lifted the tsunami warning early on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The agency has recorded at least 79 aftershocks with magnitudes ranging from 3.1 to 6.1 as of 9 a.m. on Friday, Antara News Agency has reported.</p>
      <p>So far, there have not been any reports of serious infrastructure damage or casualties caused by the earthquake, while the local authorities and military are handling the early mitigation, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) has said.</p>
      <p>BNPB spokesperson Agus Wibowo has called for local residents affected by the earthquake to remain calm and not to easily believe unverified information.</p>
      <p>“Make sure the official information is only sourced from related agencies such as the BMKG, the BNPB, the Regional Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD), provincial agency, and other authorities,” he said. (gis)</p>
