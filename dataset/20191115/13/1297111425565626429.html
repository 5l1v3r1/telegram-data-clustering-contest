      <p>The grainy photograph, extracted from a dust-coated box of slides that had not been opened for nearly half a century, captures a memorable moment in Saskatchewan Roughriders history.</p>
      <p>Jack Abendschan is shown while attempting a 34-yard field goal on what turned out to be the penultimate play of the CFL’s Western Conference final on Nov. 19, 1972, when the host Winnipeg Blue Bombers lamented a 27-24 loss to the underdogs from Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/ron-lancasters-legendary-last-game-robs-green-time-machine">Roughriders quarterback Ron Lancaster</a>, who doubled as the holder on field-goal attempts, is also visible — sort of — at a moderately illuminated Winnipeg Stadium.</p>
      <p>The recollections, I assure you, are much clearer.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>I was at the game, in the company of my sainted mother. She brought along her camera and ultimately took four photographs, the last of which was the aforementioned shot of Abendschan.</p>
      <p>The kick was wide, whereupon there was chaos during one of the whackier plays anyone will ever see.</p>
      <p>The bottom line is that Abendschan ended up getting a second chance, from two yards closer, and made the game-winning boot with no time remaining.</p>
      <p>So much time has elapsed since then. Yet, the 1972 game remains the most-recent collision of the Roughriders and Blue Bombers in a division final.</p>
      <p>That will soon change, of course, because <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-winnipeg-blue-bombers-are-still-the-best-matchup-for-the-saskatchewan-roughriders">those teams are to meet Sunday at Mosaic Stadium, with a berth in the 107th Grey Cup game at stake.</a></p>

      <p>On a different Sunday, 47 years ago, I was introduced to the wonders of aviation.</p>
      <p>My first airplane ride was a morning hop to Winnipeg. Helen Vanstone and her eight-year-old non-prodigy of a son attended the Bombers-Roughriders game in the afternoon, and flew home that evening.</p>
      <p>“Why did we go to the game?” I asked Mom the other day, after finding the pictures from 1972.</p>
      <p>“That’s just what we did,” she responded, matter-of-factly, reminding me that we subsequently attended five Grey Cup games and regularly followed the Roughriders on the road, via Dash Tours.</p>
      <p>As for 1972, Mom had booked the whirlwind excursion shortly after the Roughriders defeated the host Edmonton Eskimos 8-6 in the West semi-final.</p>
      <p>Some turbulence was detected a few hours after we landed in the Manitoba capital.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders were trailing 24-7 in the third quarter. It was cold and I was miserable.</p>
      <p>“Ronnie will find a way,” Mom told her sulking son. “As long as there’s time on the clock …”</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the stadium, in an upper-level seat, 13-year-old Les Lazaruk was in a much better mood.</p>
      <p>Lazaruk, now in his 27th season as the play-by-play voice of the WHL’s Saskatoon Blades, was a regular attendee at Blue Bombers games while growing up in Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>“Nineteen-seventy-two was supposed to be the Bombers’ year, and it looked like it was going to be, up until the second half of the Western final,” he recalls from Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>Over the first 30 minutes, Blue Bombers quarterback Don Jonas had thrown for 206 yards — 66 more than the Roughriders produced through the air during the entire game — and two touchdowns. Winnipeg’s defence had kept Lancaster and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/road-outside-mosaic-stadium-renamed-in-honour-of-george-reed">fullback George Reed</a> under control.</p>
      <p>But everything began to unravel for the home side after halftime.</p>
      <p>Blue Bombers middle linebacker Mickey Doyle suffered a broken leg, leading to personnel adjustments. The cagey Lancaster found a weakness, kept exploiting it, and the Bombers were powerless to counter.</p>
      <p>After rushing for 47 yards in the first half, Reed piled up 109 the rest of the way. Lancaster found Alan Ford for a key touchdown. Jonas, who threw for only 41 yards in the second half, was repeatedly picked off.</p>
      <p>Lazaruk, meanwhile, was ticked off.</p>
      <p>He had not anticipated such an outcome. Not that year. Certainly not at home, where the Bombers of 1972 were seemingly invincible.</p>
      <p>In the company of the Evans twins (Richard and Michael), Lazaruk watched the Bombers-Roughriders game from the new upper deck at Winnipeg Stadium, compliments of Gene Lakusiak.</p>
      <p>Then a veteran defensive back with the Blue Bombers, Lakusiak was also the boys’ phys-ed teacher at John Pritchard Junior High in Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>Leading up to the West final, Lakusiak had thoughtfully given free tickets to Lazaruk and his buddies, who were joined at the game by the Evans twins’ father.</p>
      <p>In 1972, while sitting in the “cheap seats” behind the north end zone, the youngsters had attended every one of the Blue Bombers’ regular-season home games while watching their team win the West with a 10-6 record.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders, 8-8 overall but just 2-6 on the road, were third — supposedly a walkover for the host Blue Bombers. Lazaruk and company planned to enjoy the game, and the view.</p>
      <p>“It was perfect,” Lazaruk says, appreciative to this day of Lakusiak’s generosity. “We felt like kings.</p>
      <p>“We’ve gone to all eight home games and they’ve won every one. Then we get these tickets in the upper deck of the west grandstand.</p>
      <p>“You know where this is going …”</p>
      <p>In the final minute, Lancaster marched the Roughriders to Winnipeg’s 27-yard line.</p>
      <p>With six seconds remaining, Abendschan attempted a 34-yard field goal — just as Mom took a snapshot — but the kick sailed wide.</p>
      <p>Mike Law fielded the ball in Winnipeg’s end zone and, to prevent what would have been a game-winning rouge, punted the football in the direction of the Roughriders.</p>
      <p>Lancaster, who had pinned the ball for Abendschan, caught Law’s volley and returned the punt.</p>
      <p>Paul Williams, a future Roughrider, caught the ball in Winnipeg’s end zone and launched a return kick, a line drive that was retrieved by Charlie Collins. The second-year Roughriders linebacker was tackled on the 42-yard line, as flags flew.</p>
      <p>The Blue Bombers had not given Collins sufficient breathing room and were penalized for no yards.</p>
      <p>Because a game cannot end on a penalty, the Roughriders were able to run one more play, scrimmaging the ball from the 25-yard line.</p>
      <p>“Abendschan, of course, makes the field goal on the next play,” recalls Lazaruk, the sports director of the Saskatoon Media Group.</p>

      <p>As 19,534 generally disconsolate attendees shuffled out of the stadium, the triumphant Roughriders quickly got dressed and hurried to the airport.</p>
      <p>A few hours later, they were welcomed home by thousands of Roughriders fans. From the airport, traffic was backed up all the way to downtown.</p>
      <p>According to a Leader-Post report, a traffic officer “estimated between 8,000 and 10,000 people were on hand and the terminal was crammed.”</p>
      <p>By the time we returned home on Sunday night, a few hours after the Roughriders landed, our welcoming committee at the airport consisted of Dad (Alan Vanstone) and my three-year-old sister (Laura). The prized chihuahua-terrier, a $10 acquisition named Snowball, awaited us at home.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders didn’t seem to have a snowball’s chance of upsetting Winnipeg, especially after the Bombers assumed a healthy lead.</p>
      <p>But Ronnie found a way.</p>
