      </p>
      <p>One person has died and 19 were taken to hospital after a minibus overturned following a collision with a car in Cambridgeshire.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to a junction on the B1040 Somersham Road, near the villages of Woodhurst and Bluntisham, at about 4.50pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The East of England ambulance service said it sent 10 ambulances and two air ambulances to the scene. Twenty firefighters also attended. The emergency services were supported by a hazard response team, the BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-50431845">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>An ambulance service spokesman said: “Sadly, despite our best efforts one person died at the scene.”</p>
      <p>Police said several people were seriously injured. Six people were taken to Hinchingbrooke hospital near Huntingdon and 13 were taken to Addenbrooke’s in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge">Cambridge</a>.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/calls-for-action-after-pensioner-dies-in-minibus-crash-on-b1040-1-9143919?fbclid=IwAR1SO9KB7457rsYd6HTFtRCENo5XJDXcJEWtbYCmyhz7ANX80n1nsnMWQ-c">petition</a> calling for urgent improvements to the junction had been signed by more than 1,000 people by Friday morning, Peterborough Today reported.</p>
      <p>The petition’s creator, Rachel Fabb, wrote that she had seen “horrendous accidents” at the crossroads over the past 18 years and called for better signage and either traffic lights or a roundabout.</p>
