      <p><b>Hyderabad:</b> On November 10, a class 10 girl from Bengaluru requested Telangana IT and municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao on Twitter for help her buy a brace to walk. <br/><br/>The tweet moved KTR but the Telangana government has jurisdictional constraints to extend her help from the CM relief fund. He assured the girl, named Shilpa Reddy, in his reply that his office would contact her. The girl said the brace costs Rs 1.10 lakh and she had Rs 20,000. She sought Rs 90,000 help to be able to go to school like others. She also tweeted to Karnataka CMO. <br/><br/>KTR’s friend, who chose to remain anonymous, extended the Rs 90,000 aid required for purchasing the brace. The girl, according to KTR’s office, had undergone spinal cord surgical treatment with the help extended by actor Mahesh Babu and needed the brace in the process of recovery. <br/><br/>KTR handed over the cheque of Rs 90,000 to Shilpa's father Nandish Reddy at his camp office on Friday. <br/><br/>According to reports, Dr Sumanth Kumar, Clinical Prosthetic and Orthosis, has said that the automated Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (KAFO) brace, if fixed, ensures that she doesn’t need any help as the automatic lock system of the brace helps her walk independently. <br/><br/>KTR is known for responding to tweets to help the ones in need. People in Telangana approach him personally or through social media for help. His office takes up the cases and does the needful. <br/><br/>Shilpa is a student at a government English medium high school at Konappana Agrahara in Bengaluru. <br/><br/>Rama Rao tweeted, “Since the girl was from Karnataka, we couldn’t help her from Govt. But a good friend, who wants to be anonymous, has come forward to support Shilpa. Handed over the cheque today”.</p>
