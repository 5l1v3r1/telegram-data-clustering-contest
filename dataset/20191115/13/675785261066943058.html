      <h2>A mum from Essex has taken to billing guests £40 a head to eat at hers on Christmas Day, but insists she's actually undercharging them compared with how much she spends herself</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:03:45+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Mum of two Mandie Holgate had a shock when she looked at her bank statement in January 2018.</p>
      <p>After buying presents and food and for her extended family, she entered the new year broke.</p>
      <p>So the 46-year-old from Essex decided that next year she would charge.</p>
      <p>"I realised - especially as the kids in the family were getting bigger - that I was spending an absolute fortune on Christmas Day," Mandie <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10338865/charge-family-40-christmas/">told The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>"It all adds up and you wouldn't get free food in a restaurant."</p>

      <p>Chrismas day, she worked out, had cost her £700 - as she catered for more than a dozen people.</p>
      <p>"Don't get me wrong, I love Christmas, I love hosting and I love my family," she said.</p>
      <p>"But it is so expensive. In total I've worked out it costs more than £700 to buy lunch for 16 people... I'm not made of money."</p>
      <p>Mandie admitted that part of the problem was how much she chose to spend to put on a "big show"</p>
      <p>"When I told my colleagues about it they laughed but then admitted it sounded amazing - way better than their Christmas Days," she said.</p>
      <p>And, despite the cost, she insists she's offering good value.</p>
      <p>"One person - I won't say who - disputed how much everything cost so I actually created an Excel spreadsheet outlining my expenditure," Mandie said.</p>
      <p>"When I showed them it they were stunned. And gladly handed over the £40.</p>
      <p>"Because it emerged that actually I was undercharging people."</p>

      <p>She also doesn't make her children pay for themselves, covering the cost for her son Harry, 18, and daughter Sophie, 15 - oh, and Harry's girlfriend too.</p>
      <p>"I know some people think it is bonkers how much I spend on just one day, and I know other people will kick up an absolute fuss that I'm charging my family," Mandie said.</p>
      <p>"I love to host and I want to. I'm happy to cook and clear up. I just want people to pay for what they eat and drink so come January I'm not existing on beans on toast."</p>
