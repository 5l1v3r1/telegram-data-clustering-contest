      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:24:19+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:24</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>It's almost time to take part in democracy once more.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> on December 12 will see the United Kingdom decide which political party it wishes to steer the country into the next five years and deal with the continuing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> issues.</p>
      <p>Current Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> is hoping to gain a majority for the Conservative Party and receive a mandate from the British people for his Brexit deal, while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> is hoping to end almost a decade of Conservative rule and implement changes to national services.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, smaller parties such as the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> and the Brexit Party will also be hoping to gain votes with their strong opposing positions on Brexit.</p>
      <p>But how will you vote?</p>
      <p>It won't matter unless you have registered to vote, but you may need to vote by post or proxy to have your say.</p>
