      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo netted his 55th career hat trick in a 6-0 shutout win against Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Portugal.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo is two goals away from 100 career international scores after the trio of goals Thursday at Estadio Algarve. He made a penalty kick in the seventh minute before scoring in the 22nd and 65th minutes of the victory. Pizzi, Goncalo Paciencia and Bernardo Silva also scored for Portugal.</p>
      <p>Lithuania turned the ball over in their own half during Ronaldo's first score. Paciencia picked off the pass and immediately sent a pass to Ronaldo, leading the striker toward the box. Ronaldo used his first touch to rip a right-footed shot into the upper right corner of the net, beating Lithuania keeper Ernestas Setkus as he dove across the goal trying to make a save.</p>
      <p>Portugal took a 2-0 lead into the half before netting four more goals in the second half. Pizzi scored in the 52nd minute before Paciencia gave Portugal a 4-0 lead in the 56th minute. Silva scored Portugal's fifth goal in the 63rd minute, before Ronaldo capped off the victory less than two minutes later.</p>

      <p>Silva collected a loose ball in the Lithuania box during that sequence. He dribbled through the left side of the box before sliding a quick pass to Ronaldo on his right. Ronaldo then hit a shot into the right side of the net, beating Setkus for a sixth time.</p>
      <p>Portugal plays another Group B match against Luxembourg at 9 a.m. EST Sunday at Stade Josy Barthel in Luxembourg.</p>
