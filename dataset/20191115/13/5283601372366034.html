      <h1>Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto trains to implement new catering tariff from March</h1>
      <h2>Mail, express trains to implement new rates immediately</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:56:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:56</time> by <a rel="author">Our Bureau</a></address>
      <p>The Indian Railways' revised catering tariff will be effective from March 29, 2020, on the Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto trains. However, the revised prices will come into effect immediately on mail/ express trains, an official statement from the Railways said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The revised catering tariff will raise the total ticket fare on pre-paid trains by 3-9 per cent for passengers who opt for meals, the release said.</p>
      <p>IRCTC would progressively introduce bio-degradable packaging material and have QR codes on its meals so that they can be tracked and traced.</p>
      <p>The delay in introducing higher food prices is because train tickets are booked almost four months in advance, and a number of people pay for their food in advance, while booking their tickets.</p>
      <h3>More to tickle the taste buds</h3>
      <p>The Railways has also widened the variety of food available by adding biryani to the menu.</p>
      <p>On the Rajdhani Express, Duranto Express and Shatabdi Express trains, passengers in the 2-tier AC, 3-tier AC and Chair Car, who form the largest chunk of AC passengers, will have to shell out Rs 10 more for tea and Rs 60 more for lunch and dinner.</p>
      <p>On popular demand, passengers on mail and express trains will be able to order biryani (vegetable, egg and chicken) for Rs 80 to Rs 110.</p>
      <p>The sale of snacks such as samosa and pakoda may continue on the mail and express trains, the Indian Railways has said.</p>
      <p>Passengers on mail and express trains will continue to get the Janta meal, comprising seven poories, aloo curry and pickle, for Rs 20.</p>
      <p>According to the Railways, IRCTC will not get to decide the menu of catering services on the Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duranto trains any more. However, it will be responsible for making available cleaner, better quality food and reducing complaints in catering services.</p>
      <p>IRCTC, the Railways PSU that was recently listed, will also ensure that quantity and quality are in line with the tariff and no undue benefit is passed on to the “service provider”.</p>
      <p>About 12 lakh meals are served every day and 24,000-25,000 meals are booked through e-catering, according to an IRCTC source.</p>
      <p>The number of meals served excludes the food bought from unorganised vendors selling tea, coffee, idli, dosa, mudhi-mixture, chips and cold drinks, among others. Many people also carry their own food with them.</p>
