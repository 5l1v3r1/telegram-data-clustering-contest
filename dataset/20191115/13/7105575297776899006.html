      <h1>Kate Middleton Revisits One of Her First Royal Patronages In a Beloved Oscar de la Renta Dress</h1>

        <li>This morning in East Anglia, Kate Middleton rewore her gorgeous Oscar de la Renta coatdress <a href="https://people.com/royals/kate-middletons-special-touch-with-children-in-hospice-that-is-her-character/">for a particularly important cause</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>EACH was one of her first patronages, and she's unveiling a facility she helped raise funds for.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>When she last wore the dress in January, <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/a25914899/kate-middleton-purple-oscar-de-la-renta/">it seemed like she was channeling both Princess Diana and Meghan Markle</a>, who wore a similar outfit around the same time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This morning, Kate Middleton has arrived at East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH), which offers "care &amp; support for children and young people with life-threatening conditions and their families across East Anglia." According to royal reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/byQueenVic/status/1195277694302347264">Victoria Murphy</a>, Kate became patron of EACH in 2012, and it was one of the very first charities she became patron of after she officially became part of the Royal Family post-wedding.</p>
      <p>She's in a royal rewear—her beloved fuchsia Oscar de la Renta coatdress—and opening a new £10 million The Nook facility, which will provide hospice services for kids locally. This is a cause that's incredibly important to Kate, not just because of the amount of time she's supported the organization: "Five years after she launched an appeal for funds for a new center for severely ill children, she will proudly walk into the state-of-the-art building and see the fruits of its success," per royal reporter Simon Perry.</p>
      <p>While she was there, she chatted with kids and their families. We also got a cute little Charlotte detail!</p>
