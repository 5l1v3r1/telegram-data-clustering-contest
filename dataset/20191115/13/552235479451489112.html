      <p>Perth and Kinross Council highlighted the potential dangers of winter driving this week when it shared some snaps on its Facebook page.</p>
      <p>The images were taken by a road camera in Glenshee.</p>
      <p>In a post to residents, the council said: “As we all start to notice the colder weather coming into force, the council, together with Tayside Contracts, is busy with winter maintenance work to help keep people moving on local roads and not get caught out by the chilly conditions.</p>

      <p>“In the pictures below recently taken by our local road cams, it’s clear the snow up Glenshee way is already providing challenging conditions for drivers.”</p>
