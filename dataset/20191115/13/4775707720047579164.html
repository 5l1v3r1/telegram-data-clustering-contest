      <p>X019 might not be over yet, but Team Xbox are already looking ahead to the next big event – Black Friday 2019. The Xbox Store will be offering a variety of discounts, and though no specific deals have been announced, we do now know the dates and the kind of savings we might find when those digital doors fly open.</p>
      <p>Xbox's Black Friday event will officially kick off for all shoppers from November 24th, and continue through December 2nd – also known as Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>The big headline on Xbox's <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/promotions/sales/black-friday">Black Friday page</a> is a new <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39730/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-ea-access-discord-nitro-spotify-free">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate bundle deal that includes EA Access, Discord Nitro and Spotify Premium</a>. However there will also be discounts across the Xbox One console range; specific console bundles aren't mentioned, but it's safe to assume that the X, the S and the All-Digital S will all receive some sort of discount. Xbox claim that there will be savings of up to $150 in the range.</p>
      <p>Similarly, there will be up to $20 off select items in the Xbox Wireless Controllers range – once again no specifics, but it would seem that the Gears 5 custom controller will feature if the Black Friday home page is anything to go by.</p>
      <p>The Xbox Store has a range of physical games, and for those titles that are developed by a team under the Xbox Game Studios banner, players can expect up to 50% off from November 24th to December 2nd.</p>
      <p>Finally, there's the digital game sale. While the exact games remain unknown, Xbox claim that players will be able to save up to 65% on digital games during the sale. What's more, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Xbox Live Gold subscribers will get early access – while regular shoppers won't be able to grab game discounts until the 24th, these subscribers will get access from the 21st.</p>
      <p>We'll update you with more specific deals information as it comes in – for now, we will have to make do with the general guidelines that Xbox has so far offered to us.<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/Sale">Sale<br/></a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39731/xbox-black-friday#oMessages">View comments <br/></a><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0003476400/3476448.jpg" width="64" height="64"/><br/>Written by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sam+Quirke">Sam Quirke<br/></a>Sam has been a Newshound since 2016 and is now the Editor for both TrueAchievements and TrueTrophies.
