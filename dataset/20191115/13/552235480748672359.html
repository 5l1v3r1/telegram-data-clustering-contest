      <p>Portable toilets are to be brought in for this weekend’s festivities in Perth.</p>
      <p>Thousands are expected to descend on Perth city centre on Saturday, November 16 and Sunday, November 17 for the Christmas lights switch-on, Christmas markets and food festival.</p>
      <p>As a number of Perth’s public toilets have closed for the winter months, portable toilets will be set up across the city centre instead.</p>
      <p>Event and disabled toilets will be in South St John’s Place and on Horsecross Plaza on both days.</p>
      <p>On the Saturday, there will also be toilets set up in George Inn Lane.</p>
      <p>A changing places toilet will be made available on the Saturday from noon until 8.30pm in Perth and Kinross Council’s headquarters at 2 High Street.</p>
      <p>Perth Concert Hall and Perth Theatre will also be opening their toilet doors over the weekend as part of the council’s comfort scheme.</p>
      <p>On both days, the concert hall will be open until 6pm, and on the Saturday the theatre will be open until 9pm.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Perth City Centre said: “With the seasonal closure of public toilets we have brought in portable toilets for this weekend and will be using the comfort scheme where specific local services allow the public to use toilets whether or not they are customers.</p>
      <p>“There will be signage out showing there toilets are and timings of buildings being open for your convenience.”</p>
