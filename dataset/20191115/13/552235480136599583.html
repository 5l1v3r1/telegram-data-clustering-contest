      <h2>Violent scenes erupted in Blairgowrie bar</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:37:50+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author">Perthshire Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/perthshire-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>Violent scenes which erupted in a Blairgowrie bar were likened to “something from a Wild West saloon” by Sheriff Lindsay Foulis yesterday.</p>
      <p>Fifty-three-year-old William Jeffrey, described as the “catalyst” for the trouble, was fined a total of £1300 - and banned from the Crown Bar in the town’s Wellmeadow, for two years.</p>
      <p>He admitted causing uproar in the premises on July 13 this year by engaging in a number of fights, struggling with members of the public and then picking up a chair and swinging it over his shoulder.</p>
      <p>As a result, it struck two patrons - Niamh Hunter and Louise Bloor - on the head and body.</p>
      <p>Part of the charge which alleged that he threw a tumbler was deleted.</p>
      <p>Jeffrey, of Manor Gardens, Blairgowrie, also punched another customer, Andrew Whittock, on the head during the incident which erupted at about 11pm.</p>
      <p>The court was told the initial disturbance involved Mr Whittock, the accused and his son.</p>
      <p>But other members of the public quickly became involved as they tried to “separate” those involved.</p>
      <p>“The police were contacted but the disturbance continued,” explained depute fiscal Lisa Marshall.</p>
      <p>“It moved from the bar area along the corridor and into the gents’ toilet.”</p>
      <p>The trouble seemed to calm down, but the accused became “agitated” again and picked up the chair.</p>
      <p>Numerous people were “pushing and shoving each other” in the course of the fracas and it then spilled out into Welton Road before the accused was put in the back of a police van.</p>
      <p>Solicitor MIke Tavendale said the accused had been at a barbecue for his son’s birthday that afternoon and had then gone to the pub.</p>
      <p>He suspected his drink might have been “spiked” as the incident was out of character and he had never been in trouble before.</p>
      <p>After the initial assault, a number of Mr Whittock’s friends “piled in” and the accused “got a bit of a kicking.”</p>
      <p>Neither of the women needed medical attention after being struck by the chair.</p>
      <p>The accused will pay the fine within three months.</p>
