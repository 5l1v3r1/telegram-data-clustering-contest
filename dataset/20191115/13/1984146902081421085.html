      <p>After what seems like a lifetime of preview adverts being on the telly, the new series of I'm A Celebrity finally gets going this weekend.</p>
      <p>It was back in 2002 that Ant &amp; Dec first took millions of viewers into the jungle, with Tony Blackburn becoming the hit ITV's show first ever winner.</p>
      <p>Since then the likes of Kerry Katona, Joe Swash, Matt Willis, Vicky Pattison and Scarlett Moffatt have all taken the jungle crown and now this year's <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> stars have gone Down Under ready to experience everything that jungle life throws at them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-lineup-confirmed-16118148">This year's I'm A Celebrity line-up</a> includes the likes of Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle, football legend Ian Wright and Adele Roberts.</p>
      <p>Now, while she is better known now for being a successful radio DJ on 1Xtra and Radio 1, Adele is no stranger to TV either.</p>
      <p>Cast your minds back to the summer of 2002 and you will most definitely remember her!</p>

      <p>Then 22-year-old Adele was one of the contestants on the third series of Big Brother, alongside that year's winner Kate Lawler, County Durham fireman Jonny Regan and the late Jade Goody.</p>
      <p>And while initially, Adele was popular both in the house and with Channel 4 viewers, the tide quickly turned as viewers saw a more manipulative side to her, which saw her criticise her housemates and infamously tell Jade she had a verruca - who can forget that iconic TV moment?!</p>
      <p>Unfortunately Adele's actions, which included making Jade cry, rubbed up viewers up the wrong way so much so that she became one of the most hated BB contestants ever and received a whopping 2,127,733 votes (62% of the vote) to get her out of the house.</p>
      <p>Adele's eviction saw her leave the house to massive a chorus of boos from a baying audience, with her exit prompting one of the most negative reactions in the show's history and security needing to be tightened.</p>
