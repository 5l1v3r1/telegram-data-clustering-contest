      <p>TIRUCHI</p>
      <p>This week has been a bitter-sweet one for the Cauvery delta as recent rainy weather has reprised memories of last year’s 170–180 km/h Gaja cylone that hit landfall in Nagapattinam and moved through Vedaranyam, Voimedu, Thiruthuraipoondi, Muthupettai, Pudukkottai, Adirampattinam and Pattukkottai, cutting a destructive swathe through the region.</p>
      <p>In Muthupettai, the mangrove lagoon that helped the village to offset the worst effects of the December 26, 2004 tsunami, was ravaged by Gaja.</p>
      <p>“Our fishing community was most affected as the families’ mud huts were flooded,” said K.S.H. Sultan Ibrahim, a social activist and an official of the Panchayat Union Middle School in Muthupettai.</p>
      <p>“Luckily, because the cyclone came late at night, there were fewer people out, and so there were no human casualties. But it was terrifying to see concrete structures break down, and the roads get blocked with debris like metal roofing and uprooted trees,” added Mr. Ibrahim, who also oversaw relief efforts in the neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>With nearly electricity poles and transformers destroyed, disorder reigned for several weeks in the cyclone-hit areas. “We shifted to a hotel as the electricity went off and the water dried up in our tank,” said Reem Ishaq, a homemaker based in Thanjavur’s Yagappa Nagar locality.</p>
      <p>“The hotels got filled up quickly, but even here, there were regulated power cuts of nearly 2 hours per day. Our relatives who live on a farm in Vallam were cut off from the city for several days as we had to get land-movers to remove the debris,” Ms. Reem said.</p>
      <p>Once power was restored partially in Thanjavur, many families got their inverters charged at auto mechanic shops overnight, so that they could be used at home in the morning.</p>
      <p>“In Pudukottai, homes with clay tile roofs suffered the most, as Gaja made everything fly off,” said M. Ayyappa, a professional artist who stays on the Keezha Veedhi Street.</p>
      <p>“We all got together to clear some of the trees that had fallen on the inner roads during the day, so that it would be safer to move around after sunset. We tried to mobilise some aid material like drinking water bottles through volunteer groups in Madurai and Tiruchi,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ensuring that the aid reached the affected people became a challenge. “In Vedaranyam, people lost their homes and livelihoods overnight. School buildings became a common shelter for everyone, but distributing the relief material properly became a challenge,” said R. Revathi of the Vaanvil Trust that works with children from marginalised groups in Keezhakarayiruppu village in Nagapattinam district.</p>
      <p>The NGO gave away rehabilitation kits to over 6,000 affected families in Sellur and Talaignayiru, and also initiated a housing project worth in Talaignayiru for 10 single women and people with disability, that will be ready for occupancy this week.</p>
      <p>Youth groups played a key role in coordinating relief efforts. “Initially, we sent around 50 National Service Scheme (NSS) cadets and student volunteers from three local colleges in Tiruchi and the Bharathidasan University to help deliver aid materials to the Kodikarai taluk that was among the worst-hit by Gaja,” said Allirani Balaji, president of the women and children's empowerment organisation Yugaa.</p>
      <p>“It was heartening to see the effort put in by young people across social divides to help the cyclone-hit people.”</p>
