      <p>Jakarta is set to host three separate festivals this weekend, with aspects of each to have international appeal to promote Jakarta culture to a wider audience.</p>
      <p>One of the festivals, the 2019 Jakarta International Performing Arts (JakIPA), will be held at the East Plaza of the National Monument (Monas) in Central Jakarta on Saturday and Sunday. </p>
      <p>Jakarta deputy governor of culture and tourism Dadang Solihin said JakIPA would stage mainstream performances involving theater, dance, music, film, opera, magic and a circus.</p>
      <p>JakIPA will also present communities and artists from Jakarta’s sister cities, including Berlin, Budapest, Beijing and Moscow.</p>
      <p>“We expect that we will reach a mutual cultural understanding and JakIPA will become a regular and iconic event in Jakarta’s pop culture,” Dadang said on Thursday, “We expect Jakarta’s name will be known more in the world and for Jakarta to be promoted as a modern and cultured cosmopolitan.”</p>
      <p>Another event set to take place at Monas on Sunday is the 2019 Jakarta Cosplay Parade, themed “Indonesia Universe”. </p>
      <p>The event is a competition for cosplayers with a grand prize of Rp 134 million (US$9,546). Around 1,000 cosplayers are expected to participate.</p>
      <p>Some of the judges slated to attend are internationally known cosplayers such as Erlan Bakabon, Frea Mai, Sora Hua and Echow Eko.</p>
      <p>The event is also set to invite cosplayers from neighboring countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The Jakarta Festival Pesona Lokal (Local Allure Festival) will also take place, showcasing Betawi culture and Jakarta’s local heritage. The event will be held at the Southeast Plaza of Gelora Bung Karno sports complex on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The festivals will also include a cultural parade, contemporary dance competition, local motif design competition for fans, Instagram celebrity competition, culinary and food truck festivals, local games and a bazaar.</p>
      <p>Musicians such as Raisa, Zaskia Gotik, Abdul Idol and Efek Rumah Kaca are slated to perform for the Local Allure Festival, which is part of a bigger 2019 FPL that is being held from August to November in seven cities across the country, namely Medan in North Sumatra, Denpasar in Bali, Surabaya in East Java, Bandung in West Java, Makassar in South Sulawesi, Yogyakarta and Jakarta.
