      <p>Accra, Nov. 15, GNA - Huawei, Chinese android phone manufacturers, are set to launch Hauwei Y9s in November.</p>
      <p>A statement copied to the Ghana News Agency said the new device brought improvements in design and camera technologies that younger consumers have been anticipating.</p>
      <p>It said the phone would be equipped with an AI Triple Camera setup comprising a 48 mega pixel (MP) Main Camera and an Ultra-Wide Angle lens.</p>
      <p>The statement noted that the news had already started generating discussions among tech media and consumers who are eager to find out more about the device.</p>
      <p>“As the previous HUAWEI Y Series smartphones have great performance, it is highly possible that HUAWEI Y9s will rival other entry-level products such as Samsung's A Series,” it said.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, the Huawei Y Series, Y9s was less “high-profile” than the Huawei Mate Series and P Series.</p>
      <p>Taking the design concept of “being young and powerful”, it said  Huawei had implemented flagship-level technology on the Y Series, exceeding younger consumers’ expectations of an entry-level smartphone and also won global recognition by consumers.</p>
      <p>The statement said in early September, Huawei unveiled the sales volume of Huawei Y Series at the launch of a new Y Series phone and since its first release in 2015, Huawei had shipped 200 million units of Y Series smartphones globally.</p>
      <p>It said beside the China market, the Y Series had witnessed a strong sales growth overseas, especially in Latin America, dominating the entry-level smartphone sector.</p>
      <p>The statement stated that the Huawei smartphones were well known for technological innovations, especially around stable communication and connectivity, as well as long battery life and reliable charging.</p>
      <p>“In terms of camera features, ever since the HUAWEI P20 Pro was born, Huawei smartphones started to fight back against iPhones and Samsung smartphones which topped media ranking for a long while,” it said.</p>
      <p>“With the help of the GPU Turbo technology, Huawei has greatly improved the gaming experience on its mobile phones, rivalling Qualcomm flagship SoC powered phones. Additionally, Huawei handsets impress consumers with amazing colour designs, such as the Breathing Crystal which was launched this year,” it said.</p>
