      <p>Tennent’s Lager is offering free pints to Liam Gallagher fans ahead of his headline show in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> .</p>
      <p>The Scots brewer is calling for fans to come up with their best Oasis/Tennents puns which can be exchanged for a pre-gig <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alcohol">pint</a> at the Dirty Duchess in Finnieston area of the city.</p>
      <p>It comes as the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/noel-gallagher">Oasis</a> rockstar has touched down in Glasgow for his show at the SSE Hydro on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The promotion is in memory of the Manchester band’s special connection to the Scottish city and Tennent’s Lager, reports <a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/tennents-offering-free-pints-return-17261278">Glasgow Live</a> .</p>

      <p>Oasis were famously signed by Alan McGee after playing a set in Glasgow’s iconic <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/king-tuts">King Tut’s</a> Wah Wah Hut in 1993. And, instead of being paid in cold hard cash, they were paid with cold cans of Tennent’s for their thirsty work. </p>
      <p>In a fitting tribute to the Gallagher brother’s return, Tennent’s are giving punters the chance to win a pint themselves – provided their pun game is nailed down to a T.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to take part Tennent’s Lager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/social-media">Twitter</a> channel here from 10am today and get ready to show off you best Oasis/Tennent’s puns. The top submissions will be selected at 2pm and the first pint will be on the house at the Dirty Duchess on the Finnieston strip. </p>
      <p>And who knows, maybe <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liam-gallagher">Liam</a> will join you?</p>
      <p>The star has already tweeted his excitement about the up coming gig.</p>
      <p>Taking to social media, he wrote: "Glasgow Glasgow Glasgow c’mon you know LG x”</p>
      <p>James Hughes, Tennent’s brand manager, said: “Liam Gallagher returning to Glasgow is massively exciting for the city - he’s an incredible talent who has contributed a lot to Scottish culture through his music.</p>
      <p>"We know a lot of Tennent’s fans are also fans of his work, so what better way to celebrate his visit than to offer those fans a chance to win a pre-gig pint?  Of course, if Liam fancies a pint himself, we’re sure we could arrange one. After all, he’s One of Us.”</p>
