      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge is today officially opening a new children's hospice in Norfolk after a £10million fundraising appeal.</p>
      <p>Wearing Oscar de la Renta paired with black heels, she was greeted by screaming schoolchildren waving flags.</p>
      <p>Kate is set to meet children and families being supported by East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH), of which she is Royal Patron, tour the hospice, and unveil a plaque to officially open the building.</p>
      <p>After a five-year public appeal to raise £10million and almost two years of building, EACH welcomed the first child to receive care at The Nook on Monday, September 30.</p>
      <p>EACH cares for children and young people with life-threatening conditions across Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk and supports their families.</p>
      <p>Their care service includes specialist nursing care, symptom management nursing, short breaks, wellbeing activities, therapies, counselling and volunteer services in the family home; all meeting the individual needs of the child, young person and whole family.</p>

      <p>The Duchess has been invited to have a tour of the facilities that include a hydrotherapy pool, state-of-the-art sensory room and music studio.</p>
      <p>During her visit, she is set to meet children, young people and families taking part in arts and crafts activities.</p>
      <p>Kate will also make a short speech to invited guests before unveiling a plaque to formally open the purpose-built hospice in Framingham Earl, around five miles south of Norwich.</p>
      <p>Her visit will be exactly two years since the first ‘turf cutting’ at the site.</p>
      <p>The Duchess attended the launch of EACH’s fundraising appeal at the Norfolk Showground in November 2014.</p>
      <p>She also visited the charity’s previous Norfolk hospice in Quidenham, in January 2017, to receive an update on the appeal and hear more about plans for the new building.</p>
