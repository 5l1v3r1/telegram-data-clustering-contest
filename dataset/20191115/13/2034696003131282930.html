      <p>In an album update shared back in September, Grimes revealed that she’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/grimes-reveals-ready-sit-around-sing-new-music-2545621">ready to “just sit around and sing” on her upcoming new music</a>.</p>
      <p>“I feel like for the first time, I’m really seeing myself as a singer, which is something I’ve never really done before, and it actually feels really good to just sing,” Grimes told Zane Lowe on Beats 1.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always just been so pushing that part of myself away because I’ve been like, ‘I’m a producer first.’ I think as a female, it’s important to foreground the producer stuff.</p>
      <p>“But I feel like I’ve just done that. And also, besides, i_o produced the rest of this album so it’s like…I feel like I’ve just earned my 10 minutes to just sit around and sing.”</p>
