      <p>Kondele Member of the County Assembly Joachim Oketch was in the company o the speaker, but in a different vehicle.</p>
      <p>Oraro ascended into power as acting speaker after a dramatic ouster of Onyango Oloo who was accused of various instances of misconduct in office.</p>
      <p>He was sworn in through a dramatic ceremony, as other MCAs aligned to Oloo were against the agenda.</p>
      <p>He replaced Oloo on September 1, 2019 and resumed running Kisumu County Assembly affairs.</p>
      <p>Among the allegations that Onyango Oloo is facing detail the construction of the Lake Basin Mall  with Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) MCAs arguing that he was not fit to hold office until he was cleared off the graft charges.</p>
      <p>Following the allegations, Oloo was arrested among other aides through a directive from the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP).</p>
