      <p>Jack Ross' former Sunderland assistant manager James Fowler won't be joining him at Hibernian, with the former number two instead taking a new role at Kilmarnock.</p>
      <p>Fowler worked with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross</a> at St Mirren before the pair were at the helm of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">the Black Cats</a> for 18 months.</p>
      <p>Sacked last month, Ross is set to be appointed Hibernian manager, but Fowler won't be following Ross to Easter Road, and has instead been appointed Kilmarnock's new head of football operations.</p>
      <p>Fowler is regarded as a legend with Killie, having made over 460 appearances for them and being part of the League Cup winning side in 2012.</p>
      <p>In a change from his recent coaching roles, an announcement on the club website said Fowler starts his new role on Monday and his responsibilities include overseeing 'the entire football department of the club, including First Team, Reserves, Under 18’s and the Academy. He will be responsible for all club recruitment and scouting throughout these departments.'</p>

      <p>Fowler said: “I am thrilled to be coming back to the club as head of football operations.</p>
      <p>"With the experience I’ve gained in the last 5-year in various roles within the industry, I feel that this is the right opportunity for me to implement my ideas.</p>
      <p>“The club and supporters have always been so welcoming to me, and I am looking forward to working with the board, Angelo Alessio and his staff, and the fans to continue to build the strongest team we can at Kilmarnock Football Club.”</p>
      <p>Club director Billy Bowie added: "We’re delighted to welcome James back to Killie.</p>
      <p>“James’s experience for the role is second to none and we’re all looking forward to working with him going forward.”</p>
