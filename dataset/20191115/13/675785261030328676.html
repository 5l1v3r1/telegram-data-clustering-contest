      <p>Saira Khan has admitted that she's stopped wearing her wedding and engagement rings.</p>
      <p>Speaking on ITV's Loose Women, the panelist, 49, explained that she doesn't feel like she has to wear a ring to prove that she has a happy marriage.</p>
      <p>She's also waiting for her engagement ring to be repaired after she lost the diamond while she was working out at the gym.</p>
      <p>But Saira did confess that it upset her when her husband Steve Hyde stopped wearing his rings.</p>
      <p>Saira, who married Steve in 2004 and shares two children with him, explained: "I haven't worn them for quite a while for many reasons.</p>

      <p>"I work out quite a bit, I did used to wear my wedding and engagement rings but I was doing burpees and I got home and realised my diamond had fallen out."</p>
      <p>Saira then removed her rings but it took a few weeks for her husband to realise they were gone.</p>
      <p>She continued: "I took it off and didn't think anything more of it and I genuinely didn't think Steve would think anything of it.</p>
