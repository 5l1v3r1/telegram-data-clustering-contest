      <h1>Bill Clinton offers advice to Trump amid impeachment hearings</h1>

      <p>Bill Clinton advised President Trump on Thursday to focus on his job <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-impeachment-hearings-whos-testifying-and-what-you-need-to-know/">amid impeachment proceedings</a>, saying “you don’t get the days back you blow off.”</p>
      <p>The former president <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/11/14/bill-clinton-trump-impeachment-school-shooting-vpx.cnn">called in to CNN</a> to weigh in on Trump and Congress working together on gun control legislation following the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/santa-clarita-high-school-shooter-identified-as-nathaniel-berhow/">Santa Clarita shooting</a>.</p>
      <p>“What would your message to President Trump be when he says, ‘I can’t work with these people, they’re impeaching me’?” CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked.</p>
      <p>“My message would be, ‘Look, you got hired to do a job,’” Clinton said. “You don’t get the days back you blow off. Every day’s an opportunity to make something good happen. And I would say, ‘I’ve got lawyers and staff people handling this impeachment inquiry, and they should just have at it. Meanwhile, I’m going to work for the American people.'”</p>
      <p>Clinton, who was impeached by a Republican-led House in 1998 but acquitted a year later by a Democratic Senate, also weighed in on Attorney General William Barr’s comments Wednesday that gun control measures have been “sidetracked” by the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“Look at how much we got done in 1998 and 1999 and even in ’97,” Clinton said, pointing to his own time in office.</p>
      <p>He continued, “We had very productive actions in all three years. The only really tough year we had, after the Republicans won the Congress, was ’95 to the beginning of ’96 when they shut the government down twice. But once the public rendered judgment on what they thought should be done, I just kept working with them. I mean, that’s just an excuse.”</p>
