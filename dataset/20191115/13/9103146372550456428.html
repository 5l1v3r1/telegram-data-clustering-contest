KCCA will provide transport,” she said<br/><br/>The Resident City Commissioner Makindye Division Ibrahim Kagolola said they are following up on the Government directive to take back the Karimojong back to their home. <br/><br/>He said that the government is going to provide them transport to return them home.<br/><br/>The Chairperson Napak District Joseph Lomonyang said all the illegal structures were the Karimojong have been residing will be brought down by January.<br/><br/>“We have proposed up to December to have all of them taken back,” He said adding that they were coming up with an ordinance where parents will be arrested once found bringing children to Kampala.<br/><br/>In August this year, KCCA organised a meeting that was intended to forge a way to resettle street children.
