      <p>William Roache hates <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> being labelled as a "soap".</p>
      <p>The 87-year-old actor appeared as Ken Barlow when the ITV show first aired in December 1960, and is still a cobbles regular.</p>
      <p>He has compared the programme to movies like Look Back In Anger, which sought to present "life as it really was".</p>

      </p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/i-just-seek-to-do-my-best-says-tv-history-maker-bill/">Sunday Post</a>: "Coronation Street was to be the TV equivalent of that, if you like a cutting-edge series which presented the people and their lives in the terraced houses of towns and cities.</p>
      <p>"The realism meant there would be agreements and disagreements, romances, problems, and laughter.</p>
      <p>"It was not a documentary so we all needed to be character actors and it worked.</p>
      <p>"I actually don't like hearing it called a 'soap' because it really is a drama and 'soap' sounds rather belittling for a drama series that has held the nation's interest for so long."</p>

      <p>Next year will mark the show's 60th anniversary, but Bill doesn't want to be singled out for his own longevity in the role.</p>
      <p>He said: "The series has made history and it is wonderful to be a part of it but I do see it as a team effort, a family.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't dream of walking around wearing a T-shirt saying I am the longest-serving actor in a role in the world. I never think about such things."</p>

      </p>
      <p>The soap star also isn't giving much thought to the idea of retirement, and he hopes to be able to keep playing Ken for a good while longer.</p>
      <p>He added: "I want to be there and only 10 years later Coronation Street will be 70 so all being well, Ken will be there for that too and who knows, another 10 years after that there could be a special storyline when Ken gets his 100-year telegram from the Queen!"</p>
