      <h2>With Andy Robertson missing, the Scotland boss has a decision to make on who will get the armband against Cyprus.</h2>

      <p>Scotand boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> won't name his captain for Saturday's clash with Cyprus ahead of the game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a> is out injured while the likes of Charlie Mulgrew and Kieran Tierney aren't in the squad.</p>
      <p>Scott McKenna has captained in the past while <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-naismith">Steven Naismith,</a> Callum McGregor and David Marshall could all also deputise.</p>
      <p>The game would be Naismith's 50th appearance if he is named in the starting XI while James Forrest is the next most-capped player in the squad.</p>
      <p>But the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> boss refused to say who he would hand the armband to.</p>

      <p>Clarke said: "I will keep that one under wraps until tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"Obviously it will depend a little bit on team selection as well. I'm not going to give out the team today so you will find out tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"I have always thought as a manager and even as a player that everybody in the dressing room should be a leader, everyone should try and take on part of the role of captain.</p>
      <p>"It's not something that should just be down to one person. You want as many leaders and positive people in the camp as you can get and that's what we are trying to build here."</p>
