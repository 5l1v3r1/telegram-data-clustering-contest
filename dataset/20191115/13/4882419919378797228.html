      <p>Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti is on PSG’s transfer wishlist. According to Calciomercato.com, PSG sporting director Leonardo is interested in the defender’s contractual and physical situation. The Brazilian likes Umtiti, who isn’t getting regular game time for Barca, largely because of his injury problems.</p>
      <p>Umtiti has a contract until 2023. PSG have Presnel Kimpembe and Abdou Diallo on their books but could reinforce further with Umtiti.</p>
      <p>He’s having a tough time at Barcelona after he decided to play in the Russia 2018 World Cup with a knee injury. Since then he has been injured a lot and lost his spot to Clement Lenglet.</p>
