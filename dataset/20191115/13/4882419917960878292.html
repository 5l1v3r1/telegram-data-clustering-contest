      <p>Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham want Barcelona's Brazilian mdifielder Philippe Coutinho. The playmaker is currently on loan at Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>Per The Sun, Spurs - who once wanted to sign Coutinho - are interested in him again, with the idea that he would join next summer.</p>
      <p>Poch knows Coutinho well having coached him at Espanyol, where he played on loan for a season from Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>Spurs were interested last summer but Bayern eventually sealed a loan deal. Cou has five goals in 16 matches.</p>
      <p>However he is not adapting well at Bayern and has come in for criticism. The Sun say Poch has asked Spurs' board to sign him.</p>
