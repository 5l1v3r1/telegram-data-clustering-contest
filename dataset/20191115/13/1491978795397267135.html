      <p>A statement from her agents, Scott Marshall Partners, said: “It is with great sadness that we announce the death of actress Jean Fergusson, known to millions as flirtatious Marina in the long-running BBC comedy Last of the Summer Wine.</p>
      <p>“Born in Wakefield on 30th December 1944, she was a proud Yorkshirewoman who never forgot her roots. Her career spanned more than 50 years and started in repertory playing a variety of roles.</p>
      <p>“Jean was a much-loved and respected actress, a brilliant comedienne, raconteur and the life and soul of any gathering. She will be much missed by her many friends and colleagues.”</p>
      <p>Fergusson’s stage career included the play She Knows You Know, which she wrote and starred in. She was nominated for a Laurence Olivier award in 1998 for her role as the comic Hylda Baker in a production at the Vaudeville theatre in London.</p>
      <p>In recent years Fergusson appeared on celebrity quiz shows including Pointless. She is survived by her sister and two nephews.</p>
