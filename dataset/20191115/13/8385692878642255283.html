      <p>As most of you know by now, <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/motorola">Motorola</a>'s first foldable smartphone got announced recently. The Motorola Razr is its name, and according to some information from <a href="https://www.semrush.com/">SEMrush</a>, Twitter searches for the 'foldable phone' term skyrocketed as a result of that launch.</p>
      <h3>Both 'Motorola Razr' and 'foldable phone' Twitter searches skyrocketed</h3>
      <p>According to SEMrush, a trends data provider, people on Twitter were quite interested in the Motorola Razr. The source says that searches for 'foldable phone' skyrocketed 625-percent following the Motorola Razr announcement.</p>
      <p>That's not all, though. The term 'Motorola Razr' was even more popular, as searches for it skyrocketed 911-percent. Searches for popular new smartphones usually skyrocket when they get announced, but not this much.</p>

      <p>The source also says that 41.1-percent of all tweets regarding the Motorola Razr were positive. We're talking about tweets that were describing the phone, of course, in every capacity.</p>
      <p>16.3-percent of such tweets were negative, while the source claims that the rest don't belong in either category. The tweets were pretty much neutral.</p>
      <p>SEMrush released yet another interesting tidbit regarding Motorola Razr searches. It said that the heart emoji was the most used in all tweets regarding the Motorola Razr.</p>

      <p>It seems like Motorola's new revival project is going according to plan. Many people still have fond memories of the Motorola RAZR V3 which got announced back in 2004.</p>
      <p>That is one of the company's most iconic smartphones, if not the most iconic one to date. Well, the new Motorola Razr is highly inspired by its design, while it's also equally as thin.</p>
      <h3>This device is considerably more compact than the Galaxy Fold and Mate X</h3>
      <p>The Motorola Razr may not be the first foldable device in the market, but it is the first phone that unfolds into a smartphone. The Motorola Razr is considerably more compact than the Samsung Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X.</p>

      <p>This device also seems to have solved a hinge better. A crease was not visible on demo units, and the phone includes a zero-gap hinge, unlike the Galaxy Fold.</p>
      <p>The Motorola Razr is extremely expensive, though. The phone is priced at $1,500, and its specifications are not the newest either. The phone is fueled by the Snapdragon 710, and it includes 6GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>The Motorola Razr also comes with a rather small battery. The device includes a 2,510mAh battery pack, and 15W fast charging.
