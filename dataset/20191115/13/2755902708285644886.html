      <p>In a sad case, one Fortune Khumalo might never know what it feels like to be with a woman after losing his man_hood.</p>
      <p>Fortune Khumalo (23) from Jilongo Village outside Malamulele, Limpopo, lost his 4-5 when he was nine years old in an attempted ritual killing.</p>
      <aside>“I haven’t been normal since I lost my 4-5. I wish to live a normal life like any other young man.”</aside>
      <p>Fortune’s life has been miserable since.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.dailysun.co.za/News/help-me-get-a-new-4-5-20191114">Daily Sun</a> that villagers sometimes made fun of him.</p>
      <aside>“It has been a very difficult situation. I couldn’t cope at school and dropped out.”</aside>
      <p>His mum, Siwela, said she wished to see her son live a normal life.</p>
      <aside>“I had dreams when my son was born and expected so much from him. It pains me that someone has taken away so much from him.<br/>“I also wish to have grandchildren,” said Siwela.</aside>
      <p>Fortune said he wished to have surgery to restore his man_hood.</p>
      <p>But the family faced challenges after Fortune’s father, Thomas, who was the breadwinner, died.</p>
      <p>His mum supports the family through her Sassa grant money.</p>
      <p>Fortune also helps by doing small jobs like tiling. However, he said it was hard to work in the heat as he felt pain where his 4-5 was cut.</p>
      <aside>“I need R200 000 to recover my man_hood. I’m currently being assisted at Dr George Mukhari Hospital,” he said.</aside>
      <p>The family said it was hard to forgive Lucky Simango (35), the man who chopped off Fortune’s 4-5 about 14 years ago, as he failed to disclose the names of the people who had sent him.</p>
      <p>Simango was sentenced to 15 years in jail in 2008 for the crime.</p>
