      <p>CHENNAI: Three-time <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl">IPL</a> champions <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2018-complete-ipl-squad-of-chennai-super-kings/articleshow/62684882.cms">Chennai Super Kings</a> on Friday released England cricketers <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sam-Billings">Sam Billings</a> and David Willey besides three Indian players ahead of next month's auction.</p>
      <p>The team announced on Twitter the decision to release wicketkeeper-batsman Billings and all-rounder Willey along with former World Cupper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mohit-Sharma">Mohit Sharma</a>, Dhruv Shorey and Chaitanya Bishnoi.</p>
      <p>CSK go into the December 19 auction with an available purse of Rs 14.6 crore.</p>
      <p>Willey had missed the 2019 IPL due to personal reasons as he and his wife were expecting their second child. Since it was not an injury, the team couldn't get a replacement for the Yorkshire man.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old had joined the team as a replacement player in 2018 and featured in three matches.</p>
      <p>Billings also had been part of the squad in the past two seasons. He had played ten games in MS Dhoni-led CSK's title-winning run in 2018 including a match-winning 56 against Kolkata Knight Riders at the MA Chidambaram stadium.</p>
      <p>Shorey played a solitary match in the 2019 season while Bishnoi did not get to play.</p>
      <p>Mohit too was confined to the bench with the emergence of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chahar">Deepak Chahar</a> as a key bowler for CSK during the run to the final last season.</p>
      <p>The team has retained the core of players which includes skipper Dhoni, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Suresh-Raina">Suresh Raina</a>, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Ambati Rayudu, Murali Vijay, Kedar Jadhav, Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo and Australian all-rounder <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shane-Watson">Shane Watson</a> among others.</p>
