        <i>The 60,000-capacity event due to host Mumford &amp; Sons and Lil Pump was called off after a week of violence between police and protesters</i>
      </p>
      <p>Clockenflap festival in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>, one of the most high-profile music events in Asia, has been cancelled because of the continuing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/second-death-in-hong-kong-protests-as-xi-demands-end-to-violence">protests in the city</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement, festival organisers said: “Due to the escalation in the crisis this week, and the uncertainty this creates for the coming weeks, Clockenflap 2019 will be cancelled. We still believe in bringing people together in positive ways, and will continue to unite people through the power of music and arts.” Refunds are promised for ticket holders within four weeks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/21/clockenflap-pop-festival-hong-kong-stormzy-massive-attack-kaiser-chiefs">The 60,000-capacity festival</a> was due to run from 22-24 November, with Mumford &amp; Sons, Halsey and Lil Pump among the acts booked to perform.</p>
      <p>Founded by three British promoters in 2008, Clockenflap is popular among Hong Kong’s expat community and features primarily western artists, though with an increasing number of east Asian performers in recent years. Previous headliners have included Chic, the Chemical Brothers, Erykah Badu and New Order.</p>
      <p>The decision comes after violence in the pro-democracy protests, which began five months ago, escalated in the last week. A 70-year-old man <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/second-death-in-hong-kong-protests-as-xi-demands-end-to-violence">died on Thursday</a> after being struck by a brick, a week after a student protester died after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/08/hong-kong-protests-student-who-fell-from-parking-lot-during-demonstrations-dies">falling from a building</a>. Friction between police and demonstrators intensified after footage emerged on Monday of a police officer shooting a student in the stomach, and another officer hit a protester with a motorbike.</p>
