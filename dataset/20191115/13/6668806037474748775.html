      <p>The actor in his interview to a leading news portal spoke about his upcoming film Shershaah. Directed by Vishnuvardhan this Dharma Productions’ venture will have Sidharth playing a real life character for the first time. Talking about the same he said,  “It's a special story, I've been trying to make this story for about two and a half-three years. It's a biopic on Captain Vikram Batra who was a soldier who gave his life for our country during the Kargil war and I'm giving out his life story. For the first time I am playing a real life character. We have pretty much finished shooting and have only a few more days left.”</p>
