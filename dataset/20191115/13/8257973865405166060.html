      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- Mark Ruffalo said on <i>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</i> that he doesn't know if The Hulk will be seen again in the Marvel cinematic universe.</p>
      <p>"I don't know," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC3ESY3cyRo">the actor said</a> on Thursday when asked if he will portray the giant green superhero again and his alter-ego, Bruce Banner.</p>
      <p>Ruffalo mentioned that he discussed his future as the character with Marvel head Kevin Feige recently at the <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2019/11/04/Hollywood-Film-Awards-honor-Charlize-Theron-Avengers-Endgame/4751572868339/">Hollywood Film Awards</a> where <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> won the Hollywood Blockbuster Award.</p>
      <p>"He did say, 'Hey, do you think there's anymore story left here?' and I said, 'I could probably come up with a few storylines,"' Ruffalo said of his interaction with Feige.</p>
      <p>Ruffalo first appeared as The Hulk starting with 2012's <i>The Avengers</i>. He also starred in 2015's <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, 2017's <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, 2018's <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and 2019's <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old also defended Marvel movies following comments from director Martin Scorsese and other filmmakers that the movies are not cinema.</p>
      <p>"All these kids were bawling, crying, freaking out, screaming in the car and that's real emotion I think," Ruffalo said of the emotional reaction his son and his friends had to seeing an <i>Avengers</i> film.</p>
      <p>Ruffalo will next be seen in <i>Dark Waters</i> where he portrays <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2019/09/18/Dark-Waters-Mark-Ruffalo-takes-on-DuPont-in-first-trailer/4051568821078/">real-life</a> corporate attorney Robert Bilott who takes on DuPont after the chemical company is linked to a series of unexplained deaths. The film is set to hit theaters on Nov. 22.</p>
