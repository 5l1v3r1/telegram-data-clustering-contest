      <p>As these are both incremental updates, we didn’t expect any major inclusions or enhancements. That said, the regularity of updates and fixes is great for those that have picked up either OnePlus flagship.</p>
      <p>Expect to see the OxygenOS 10.0.6 and 10.0.4 updates rolling out over the coming days and weeks depending on your region. If you simply cannot wait, you may want to try flashing the OTA update files using Oxygen Updater.</p>
