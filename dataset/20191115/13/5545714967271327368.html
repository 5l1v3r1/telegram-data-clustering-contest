      <p><i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../diablo-iv-will-feature-a-shared-open-world-with-five-regions-and-a-non-linear-campaign-571191.phtml">Diablo IV</a></i> helped BlizzCon 2019 kick off right, washing off the blowback of <i>Diablo Immortal</i> in 2019. The classic <i>Diablo</i> style is back, and it looks like this is going to be a substantial game with some open-ended gameplay. But it's still a ways away, and that very BlizzCon showing is the only information we're going to get for a while.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an official open letter, game director Luis Barriga notes that the team is blown away by the reception for<i> Diablo IV</i> so far, referring to the online presence and the "packed" lines for the demo stations and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../blizzcon-s-diablo-iv-inspired-dark-gallery-exhibit-is-wild-571254.phtml">the Dark Gallery at BlizzCon</a>. Most importantly, Barriga says there is a "cool update" planned for February 2020, where we'll learn more about the game in a "series of quarterly updates." The first burning question that will be answered? "Items and stats" and the conversation surrounding balance.</p>
      <p>Take your time Blizzard! Do this right and you'll win back all of the lapsed <i>Diablo II </i>fans. But as someone who loved <i>Diablo III </i>(and maxed out every class a month after launch), combining both new and old design is a fantastic idea for a sequel that requires that sort of shakeup.</p>
