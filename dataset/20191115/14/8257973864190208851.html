      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- Israel's air force launched attacks early Friday against Islamic Jihad targets in <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Gaza/?tps=1">Gaza</a> less than a day after a cease-fire took effect, officials said.</p>
      <p>Fighter jets and <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271703">other aircraft hit</a> a military compound that produces rockets similar to those that were fired at Israel early this week. The strike also targeted a command center for the Khan Yunis terrorist group.</p>
      <p>A cease-fire, agreed to by Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, began early Thursday but Israeli officials said the group's rocket attacks continued.</p>
      <p>"[The military] considers the breach of the cease-fire and the rocket fire on Israel to be very serious," said a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, adding that the unit is on high alert and will continue to repel "attempts to harm Israeli civilians."</p>
      <p>Israel's <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Iron_Dome/?tps=1">Iron Dome</a> intercepted two rockets, <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5626008,00.html">officials said</a>.</p>
      <p>Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in two days of fighting, and officials say nearly half were civilians -- including eight children and three women. On the Israeli side, dozens were injured.</p>
      <p>Several Israeli schools within range of the rockets were closed Friday.</p>
      <p>"Following the rocket sirens in the area, the forum of the heads of the Gaza border councils decided that [Friday] there will be no studies at any educational institutions in the councils surrounding Gaza," officials said in a joint statement. "We are in contact with the IDF and are monitoring developments."</p>
      <p>Palestinian protesters called late Thursday for more rocket strikes on Israeli cities.</p>
      <p>Islamic Jihad spokesman <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Abu_Hamza_al-Masri/?tps=1">Abu Hamza</a> said fighters in "all military units still have their fingers on the trigger and are functioning in an integrated military system.</p>
      <p>"They are at the disposal of the organization's leadership."</p>
