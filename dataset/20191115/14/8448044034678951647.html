      <p>VANCOUVER - What started as a call about a car fire ended in an act of kindness the parents of a B.C. toddler battling cancer won't forget.</p>
      <p>The Stanleys' story began with a fever.</p>
      <p>The family from Armstrong, B.C., took two-year-old Finnley to see a doctor in the summer, because his temperature was higher than normal, and suffering from night sweats.</p>
      <p>"We went to emergency three times," his mother, Jennell, told CTV News Thursday.</p>
      <p>The third time, staff at the hospital in Salmon Arm did a blood test. The toddler tested positive for leukemia.</p>
      <p>"We were put on a jet about 15 minutes later," she said.</p>
      <p>The family was flown to BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver, about 450 kilometres away.</p>
      <p>That was July 1. The family had to move into Vancouver's Ronald McDonald House, a place that just a few months ago had never crossed their minds.</p>
      <p>Since then, the young boy has had several intense chemotherapy treatments.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Finnley's small body is accepting the treatment, but some days are difficult.</p>
      <p>"It's hard to watch him go through the tough stuff," Jennell said.</p>
      <p>Last Friday was one of those days, so on Saturday, Finnley's parents treated him and his five-year-old sister to lunch in the North Vancouver neighbourhood of Deep Cove.</p>
      <p>"On our way back, we were merging off of Dollarton Highway onto (the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge). Our 2013 Santa Fe, it died," said Finnley's father, Jordan.</p>
      <p>They called a tow truck and moved away from the vehicle. It burst into flames as they waited.</p>
      <p>"It was fully involved within about four or five minutes before the fire department could even get there," he said.</p>
      <p>Vancouver firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze, but inside the vehicle were toys, car seats and other belongings, some of which were of sentimental value.</p>
      <p>Among the items were two quilts made by family and friends, meant to provide comfort for Finnley and his sister during what has been a difficult time for the family.</p>
      <p>Firefighters were able to save the quilts, but most of the items were destroyed.</p>
      <p>"We salvaged what we could," said Vancouver Fire Rescue Services spokesperson Jonathan Gormick.</p>
      <p>They brought all items they could save back to the family.</p>
      <p>"Cleaned it up, dried it off, and hopefully brightened up the kids' days little bit in what's definitely a stressful situation," Gormick said.</p>
      <p>They didn't stop there. The Stanleys were invited to the station for dinner, and found that the firefighters had replaced some of the burned toys.</p>
      <p>"Any small gesture that seems insignificant to you can make a huge impact in someone else's life," Gormick said.</p>
      <p>"I can't imagine the stress they're going through right now. To see them pull through with a positive attitude and be in good spirits is inspiring."</p>
      <p>But that's how the Stanley family copes, they said. After Finnley got sick, something like a car fire didn't seem as significant.</p>
      <p>"We've learned to kind of take things as they come," Jennell said.</p>
      <p>Jennell and Jordan say they're thankful to firefighters for helping them when they needed it, but added they had one request from the public.</p>
      <p>"If I could say anything to anybody watching, give blood," said Jordan. Finnley had seven or eight transfusions in his first two weeks alone.</p>
      <p>And he added one more thing: "Give the emergency personnel space when they're doing their job. Give them credit. They really do an amazing job and they put their lives on the line."</p>
