        <b>Last year, the United States announced a unilateral suspension of its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, citing alleged violations of the accord by Russia – a claim Moscow denies. Russia responded in kind, suspending its obligations as well. On 2 August, the US officially pulled out from the accord.</b>

      <p>The New START nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the United States is likely to face the same fate as the INF Treaty that expired on 1 February 2019, Sergei Naryshkin, the chief of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The NEW Start treaty, signed in 2010, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911081077250711-extension-of-new-start-treaty-particularly-important-after-inf-collapse---berlin/">is set to expire</a> on 5 February 2021, although it can technically be extended until 2026.</p>
      <p>The accord stipulates the reduction of strategic nuclear missile launchers by half and limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550.</p>
      <p>New START is currently the last remaining arms control treaty between Moscow and the United States after the collapse of the INF Treaty earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The US officially abandoned the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on 2 August, half a year after it suspended its obligations under it.</p>
      <p>Washington accused Russia of violating the deal, while Russia maintained that the claims were unsubstantiated.</p>
      <p>The treaty required the United States and Russia to eliminate and permanently forswear all nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres (310-3,417 miles).</p>
