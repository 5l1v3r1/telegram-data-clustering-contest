      <h1>White House releases transcript of Trump’s first call with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky</h1>

      <p>The White House on Friday released the transcript of President Trump’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/trump-to-release-transcript-of-second-call-with-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky/?utm_source=url_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons">first call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky</a> – in which he congratulated him “on a fantastic election.”</p>
      <p>The president had promised several times to release the transcript of the April 12 call, which he described as more important that the one about two weeks later in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>That call prompted a whistleblower complaint that led Democrats to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-marie-yovanovitchs-testimony/">launch an impeachment inquiry</a>. The probe centers on whether Trump abused his power by withholding almost $400 million in security aid to put pressure on the US ally.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to congratulate you on a job well done, and congratulations on a fantastic election,” Trump told Zelensky.</p>
      <p>“As you can see, we tried very hard to do our best. We had you as a great example,” the Ukrainian leader said.</p>
      <p>Trump continued: “I think you will do a great job. I have many friends from Ukraine and they think – frankly – expected you to win. And it’s really an amazing thing that you’ve done.”</p>
