      <h1>Video: X3 M Competition goes for top speed run, beats BMW claims</h1>

      <p>The BMW X3 M Competition is proving to be full of surprises these days. After several publications tested the car, including independent journalists such as <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/13/video-doug-demuro-dubs-the-bmw-x3-m-competition-his-favorite-suv/">Doug DeMuro</a>, the general consensus is that we’re looking at a seriously fast car here. Some have used precision clockwork to measure the capabilities of the new M car while others simply used the seat of their pants. Nevertheless, this thing is a proper land rocket as this video proves.</p>
      <p>Shot by the usual guys over at AutoTopNL, the clip below shows the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/14/video-bmw-x3-m-competition-vs-alfa-romeo-stelvio-qv-on-track/">BMW X3 M Competition</a> going for a top speed run. According to BMW, the car is limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), a speed that can be increased to 280 km/h (174 mph) with an optional feature. That’s quite fast for any car and, sans the Autobahn – where the footage is shot – , you could probably only hit that speed on a race track, with a long enough straight.</p>

      <p>What’s most important to notice here though, is how fast everything goes down. According to BMW, the X3 M Competition should reach the benchmark speed of 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.1 seconds. However, this time round, the car drops under the 4-second mark. And that’s in the wet, by the way. Thus, I reckon the 3.3-second dash to 60 mph recorded by <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/13/the-bmw-x3-m-competition-is-seriously-fast-car-and-driver-test/">Car and Driver</a> is totally doable, in different weather conditions.</p>
      <p>The car then goes on to a speedometer-shown top speed of 286 km/h (177.6 mph) without too much hassle. What’s most impressive is that the 100-200 km/h (62 – 124 mph) that takes just about 10 seconds, proving the S58 engine means business. The new 3-liter straight six mill will also be used on the upcoming M3 and M4 models and I just can’t wait to see how fast they will be. In the meantime you can order an X3 M Competition as an alternative if you just can’t cope with the wait anymore.</p>
