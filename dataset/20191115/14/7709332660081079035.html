      <p>I find myself web searching for some tool by <a href="https://codepen.io/yoksel">Yoksel</a> at least every month. I figured I'd list out some of my favorites here in case you aren't aware of them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Need to duo-tone an image? SVG filters can do that. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-svg-to-create-a-duotone-image-effect/">Lentie Ward wrote about it for us</a>, and Yoksel has a tool to <a href="https://yoksel.github.io/svg-gradient-map/#/">create the filters yourself</a>.</li>
        <li>Let's say you have an SVG you want to use as a CSS <code>background-image</code>? <a href="http://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/">Drop it in this URL-encoder tool</a> to make sure it's ready to go and safe to use.</li>
        <li>Want to understand the difference between clipping and masking and how it works differently for SVG and CSS? We've <a href="https://css-tricks.com/clipping-masking-css/">written about that</a> a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/masking-vs-clipping-use/">few times</a>, but Yoksel <a href="https://codepen.io/yoksel/full/fsdbu/">has the best reference</a> for seeing live examples and the code for them.</li>
        <li>Perhaps you have a SVG path that you ultimately want to use as a CSS <code>clip-path</code>? You might fight against absolute units, but Yoksel <a href="https://yoksel.github.io/relative-clip-path/">has a tool to fix that</a>.</li>
        <li>SVG filters are incredibly powerful. Hand-crafting them is pretty hard. <a href="https://yoksel.github.io/svg-filters/#/">Yoksel has GUI tool</a> for playing with them and combining them.</li>
