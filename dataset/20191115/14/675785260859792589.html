      <h1>Boris Johnson gets EU immigration figures completely wrong in BBC interview</h1>
      <h2>The Prime Minister was speaking on BBC 5 Live about Brexit and immigration but he badly got his figures wrong when asked by Rachel Burden</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:03:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson got his figures all wrong when quizzed on migration this morning.</p>
      <p>He incorrectly claimed that both EU and non-EU migration are in equal proportion.</p>
      <p>It's actually closer to 20/80 EU to non-EU.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minster insists that a Conservative government would be able to reduce immigration after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>
      <p>Johnson also made clear he had no intention to replicate the numerical targets for immigration set by his predecessors.</p>
      <p>The Tory party pledge to get immigration down to 'tens of thousands' has never been met.</p>

      <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Johnson said he was “in favour of people coming to this country”, but claimed immigration had put public services under pressure. </p>
      <p>“It has in some sectors helped to keep our wages down,” he said.</p>
      <p>When pressed on the proportion of people coming into the UK –  according to the latest official figures  – were from within the EU, Mr Johnson said: “Came from within the EU? From memory the total net migration proportions are about 50-50, but I may be wrong about that.”</p>
      <p>The presenter Rachel Burden pointed out: “You are wrong about that.“</p>

      <p>She continued: “According to the latest official statistics - over 200,000 came from outside the EU according to the 2019 statistics, and around 59,000 within the EU.”</p>
      <p>The figures were released earlier this year representing the lowest level of EU net migration to the UK since 2009.</p>
      <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said net migration from outside the EU had risen to its highest level in 15 years in the same period.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, Mr Johnson told BBC Breakfast: “I do think myself we’ve been running very high rates of immigration for a long time.</p>
      <p>“I’m a pro-immigration politician. I think immigration can be a wonderful thing.</p>
      <p>“I happen to think the rates you’re talking about have been very high and what we will be able to do once we come out of the EU, in January, is we will be able to take control of our borders.”</p>

      <p>He continued: “When it comes to unskilled immigration, for people who don’t have a job to come to, we will get the numbers down. Overall, as a result, it will be lower. I can’t give you a figure.</p>
      <p>“If you forgive me I’m not going to get into a numbers game.</p>
      <p>"People have got into plenty of difficulty of satisfying those particular targets.”</p>
