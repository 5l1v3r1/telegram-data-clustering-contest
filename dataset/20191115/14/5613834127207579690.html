      <h1>‘Dead Island 2’ Still Very Much Alive, According to Koch Media CEO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:03:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>The zombie that is <b><i>Dead Island 2</i></b> still walks, according to Koch Media’s CEO Klemens Kundratitz. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-14-how-koch-media-is-ensuring-classic-brand-comebacks-are-worth-the-wait">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Kundratitz says the game is still very much in development. “Look, <i>Dead Island</i> is a very important brand for us and we’ve got to get it right,” says Kundratitz. “It’s just a testimony of our dedication to get it right.”</p>
      <p>The project has been in development hell since its announcement back in 2014. Since then, the game has moved hands from the <b><i>Dying Light</i></b> team, to Sumo Studios, and now to Dambuster Studios.</p>
      <p>And despite <i>Dead Island 2</i> no longer being developed by Techland (who created the original game), Koch Media, which is owned by THQ Nordic, retains a good relationship with the developer. Kundratitz also isn’t concerned about the conflict of interests (as <b><i>Dying Light 2</i></b> will be hitting retail in 2020, as well), saying it would be a conflict if both games were launching around the same time, but it won’t be a problem for them.</p>
      <p>“It’s a great story to tell everyone that it’s on its third studio, but we like to be judged on the end result and we’re really confident that when it comes out it’s going to be a kick-ass zombie game,” Kundratitz continues. “We’ll certainly give it all our power.”</p>
      <p><i>Dying Light 2</i> is to be released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
