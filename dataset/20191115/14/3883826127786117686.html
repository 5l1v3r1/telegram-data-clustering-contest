        <b>US President Donald Trump has confirmed he will travel to London 10 days before the UK general election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He will be in the capital with the first lady for the Nato summit between 2 and 4 December.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace, which will be hosted by the Queen.</p>
      <p>The president has previously been criticised for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50252285">voicing his opinions of British political leaders, including Boris Johnson</a> and Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The White House said in a statement that the president "looks forward to meeting" the other Nato leaders and would "emphasize the need for the Nato alliance to ensure its readiness for the threats of tomorrow".</p>
      <h3>'Unprecedented progress'</h3>
      <p>These threats include "those emanating from cyberspace, those affecting our critical infrastructure and telecommunications networks, and those posed by terrorism," the statement said.</p>
      <p>It said the leaders would "review the alliance's unprecedented progress on burden-sharing, including adding more than $100bn (Â£76bn) in new defence spending since 2016."</p>
      <p>In October the president criticised Mr Johnson's Brexit deal with the EU, saying it restricted the US's ability to do future trade with the UK.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, on LBC, he said that without the deal the two countries could "do many times the numbers" than now.</p>
      <p>The US president also took aim at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying he would be "so bad" as prime minister.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn accused him of "trying to interfere" in the UK general election to boost "his friend Boris Johnson".</p>
