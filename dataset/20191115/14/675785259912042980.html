      <h1>General election 2019: Boris Johnson unveils Tory battle bus and it looks very, very familiar</h1>
      <h2>Don't panic! After boarding 'Con Air' last week Boris Johnson finally has a battle bus - and the six-wheeled 2019 general election monstrosity reminds us of something</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:22:39+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>When he unveiled <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/boris-johnsons-brexit-campaign-prints-7943300">his lie-strewn referendum bus in 2016,</a> we cried: Who do you think you are kidding Mr Johnson?</p>
      <p>And this time, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> really has gone full Dad's Army with his six-wheeled Tory battlebus.</p>
      <p>The red, white and blue Mercedes-Benz Tourismo is plastered with the phrase "GET unleash BREXIT britain's potential DONE".</p>
      <p>But it's the little arrow at the end that couldn't help reminding us of something.</p>
      <p>You stupid boy! Of course, it's the title sequence of Dad's Army.</p>

        <figcaption>Look familiar?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Except this time the arrow is pointing not to the opposing WW2 Army but up into the blue sky, where most of Johnson's Brexit hopes reside.</p>
      <p>Of course, Boris Johnson will no doubt insist it's nothing to do with the 1970s TV hit. After all, they don't like it up 'em.</p>
      <p>And if he does, we have an alternative suggestion.</p>
      <p>Doesn't it also look like the £100m, taxpayer-funded 'Get Ready for Brexit' campaign that wrongly prepared the nation for October 31?</p>
      <p>The colours, the arrows... it's almost like they've taken inspiration from something paid for by HM Government. Which in an election campaign, would be extremely naughty. So we're sure they haven't.</p>

      <p>The Prime Minister unveiled the bus today in Greater Manchester, in a half-empty warehouse - scuppering the risk of pesky protesters.</p>
      <p>He emerged via the emergency exit and described it as a "wonderful" bus, news agency PA Media honourably reported.</p>
      <p>He added in a speech to Tory activists there will be "buses that are a lot greener than this" once his party has implemented its "fantastic" policies.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson also said: "Some of you may be asking why do we even need a bus, why do we even need an election?</p>
      <p>"The answer is because Parliament is unfortunately paralysed."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson later branded Labour's plan to nationalise broadband a "crazed Communist scheme", and largely got away with it, because he didn't take press questions at the launch.</p>

      <p>Of course, we were kidding about the slogan earlier - though the read-across is rather unfortunate.</p>
      <p>What it really says is: "Back Boris and vote Conservative to... Get <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Done."</p>
      <p>It has a tagline stating: "A stronger economy to invest in our NHS, schools, police, infrastructure."</p>
      <p>A small piece of text reading "emergency exit break glass" can also be seen.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But reliable sources inform PA Media this is a safety measure connected to the bus rather than a Conservative slogan.</p>
      <p>Either way it certainly beats 'Con Air' - the nickname Boris Johnson gave to the plane he took last week when he was touring the nations of the UK.</p>
      <p>In a hapless piece of PR, he boarded the jet at the same time as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> was unveiling its own battle bus - which says it's "time for real change".</p>
