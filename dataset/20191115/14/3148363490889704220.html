      <h1>Adam Schiff Interrupts Republican Asking If He Will Interrupt Republicans | Breitbart</h1>

      <p>House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) interrupted Rep. Elaine Stefanik (R-NY) as she asked him Friday whether he would continue to interrupt Republican questions to witnesses, as in earlier hearings.</p>
      <p>The setting was the second day of public hearings in the “impeachment inquiry” into President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Stefanik raised a point of order after both Schiff and ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) had delivered their opening statements. Schiff initially ruled Stefanik was not recognized by the chair, when she raised a parliamentary inquiry, but when she changed her question to a point of order, he reluctantly allowed her to begin speaking.</p>
      <p>Then:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Stefanik:</b> The point of order is, will the chairman continue to prohibit witnesses from answering Republican questions as you’ve done in closed hearings and as you did this week — <b>Schiff:</b> [Bangs gavel] The gentlewoman will suspend. <b>Stefanik</b>: When you interrupted our  — <b>Schiff:</b> That is not a proper point of order. The gentlewoman will suspend. <b>Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH):</b> Mr. Speaker — Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order. <b>Schiff:</b> The gentleman is not recognized. <b>Jordan:</b> Chairman, I have a point of order. <b>Schiff:</b> The gentleman is not recognized. <b>Jordan:</b> I have a point of order, though. <b>Schiff:</b> The gentleman is not recognized. I do want to respond, I allowed the — <b>Jordan:</b> [Emphatically] A point of order. <b>Schiff:</b> The gentleman is not recognized. <b>Jordan:</b> About — there are four transcripts not have not been released — <b>Schiff:</b> [Bangs gavel] The gentleman is not recognized. <b>Jordan:</b> Holy cow.</blockquote>
      <p>A moment later, Stefanik tried again:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Stefanik:</b> Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order. Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order. <b>Schiff:</b> The gentlewoman is not recognized. <b>Stefanik:</b> [Exasperated] So we know, clearly, you are going to interrupt us throughout this hearing. <b>Schiff:</b> The gentlewoman — [Bangs gavel] — The gentlewoman is not recognized.</blockquote>
      <p>Schiff would not recognize further Republican procedural questions, and introduced former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, the featured witness of the day.</p>
