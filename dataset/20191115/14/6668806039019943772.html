      <p>What looks like a well planned murder by Emraan, falls flat when the body goes missing and then comes in Rishi Kapoor who once again impresses with his acting prowess. He tries to solve the case in hand and as the story unfolds one gets involved completely to find out what exactly happened with the body. Was it taken away by someone, or was the murder unsuccessful? Well, to find that out, you'll have to watch The Body in a theatre near you on December 13, this year. If you haven't watched the trailer yet, catch it here.</p>
