      <h3>The early success of La Ronge’s alcohol strategy has other Saskatchewan communities mulling how to tackle problematic drinking.</h3>
      <p>In the three years since the region became part of the provincial government’s Northern Alcohol Strategy, there’s less booze at community events, more family-friendly recreation and shorter hours for bars and liquor stores, all meant to tackle the <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/lac-la-ronge-indian-band-seeks-funding-for-treatment-centre-to-help-growing-numbers-who-struggle-with-alcohol">area’s long-standing substance abuse problem,</a> which affects residents of all ages and backgrounds. </p>
      <p>Dr. James Irvine, a medical health officer in the region, said the early prognosis is that it’s working. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/rate-of-alcohol-related-hospitalizations-high-in-northern-saskatchewan">Emergency room visits related to alcohol</a> were eight per cent lower in March 2019 compared to November 2017.</p>

      <p>RCMP Acting Staff Sgt. Josh Hallett said alcohol-related calls have dropped over the past three years, although he cautioned it’s too soon to determine why. Coun. Matt Klassen, who represents the town on the community alcohol management plan committee, said school attendance has increased since the plan was implemented. </p>
      <p>“I think rather than burying our heads in the sand and pretending there’s not a problem, people in this community have worked together to do something about it,” Hallett said. “It really is an inspiring thing to see.”</p>
      <p>Hallett said calls for alcohol-related incidents have also dropped since the plan was enacted, although he was cautious to say it’s too soon to know if the strategy is responsible for the change.</p>
      <p>Observers in other communities say they’re watching closely — and wondering how lessons from La Ronge could be applied at home.</p>
      <p>The province and Saskatchewan Government Insurance announced last month they’d invest $250,000 more into the strategy to expand it to English River First Nation, Creighton and La Loche.</p>
      <p>Strategy director Carla Frohaug said she’s “cautiously optimistic” about the results from La Ronge and hopes “more communities in the province will be empowered to address alcohol misuse.”</p>
      <p>She also stressed that the strategy and its options, which centre on harm reduction, are strictly up to communities to adopt of their own will, according to their own needs.</p>
      <p>In particular, La Ronge’s bylaw restricting liquor sale hours has other municipalities wondering if last call should come sooner.</p>
      <p>The town’s council voted narrowly last December to stop liquor sales at 11 p.m. and bar service hours at 1 a.m. from Monday to Saturday, with even shorter hours on Sundays and statutory holidays.</p>
      <p>It was — and still is — controversial. Original recommendations from a committee included capping hours on days when welfare cheques were issued, which Mayor Ron Woytowich said would target low-income residents and First Nations income assistance recipients.</p>
      <p>He believes the provincial government is treating the symptom instead of the root causes of substance abuse, like trauma, mental health and joblessness, he said.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I’m against, not controlling alcohol. I couldn’t care less if they banned it.” </p>
      <p>Coun. Jordan McPhail had similar concerns and voted against earlier drafts of the bylaw. He sided with it in the end, partially because he thinks current liquor laws, which allow on-site service until 2 a.m. and liquor sales until 3 a.m., are too lenient, he said.</p>
      <p>“There’s basically no good reason you should be able to buy 60 ounces of hard liquor at an off-sale at 3 a.m. We all know the old saying that ‘nothing good happens after two.’ ”</p>
      <p>Robert Bratvold of the Community Alcohol Steering Committee in Prince Albert, where hospitalizations related to alcohol are more than 70 per cent higher than the national average, said he’s encouraged the local government to assert more autonomy in setting liquor sale hours, although he did not say directly whether he supports capping bar hours.</p>
      <p>“You have an opportunity to regulate and scale,” Bratvold said. “So you might ask local industry and say, ‘What good is a case of beer at two in the morning, really?’ ”</p>
      <p>Regulation has potential negative consequences. Bratvold noted that restricting bar hours could push people to neighbouring jurisdictions, for example.</p>
      <p>Dr. Peter Butt, an addictions specialist at the University of Saskatchewan, argued restricting hours somewhat could be seen as more of a harm reduction measure than a prohibitionist one, a view shared by Dr. Irvine.</p>

      <p>“I certainly can see this snowballing and gaining some support in the south,” Butt said.</p>
      <p>Whether or not municipalities take that route, most agree that acknowledging their communities’ struggle with alcohol misuse has been a transformational step by itself.</p>
      <p>La Loche RCMP Staff Sgt. Conrad Logan, who estimates more than 90 per cent of his division’s calls are alcohol-related, said an initial educational meeting last week gave community members a needed chance to study evidence-based approaches. He believes it will help his division engage more with the community and tackle the root of the issue instead of just the symptom, he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a better way of doing business and connecting with our community.”</p>
