      <p>Two cars have been cordoned off with police tape on Kilmarnock's Queen's Drive this afternoon.</p>
      <p>There appears to have been a collision between the vehicles near the Ayrshire Athletics Arena, heading towards the Bellfield Interchange.</p>
      <p>Both cars are sealed off with police tape and an ambulance car is on the scene.</p>
      <p>The road is not shut as it stands as they are both pulled into the side of the road, but traffic is slower than normal around the incident.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland have been contacted for comment.</p>
