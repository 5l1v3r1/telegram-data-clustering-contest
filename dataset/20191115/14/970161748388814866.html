      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> told the president of Ukraine that his country was ‘very well represented’ at the Miss Universe pageant.</p>
      <p>The President of the United States cracked the joke with Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call in April, a memo from which was released on Friday.</p>
      <p>Trump responded to Zelensky’s positive comments about Ukraine by saying: ‘Well, I agree with you about our country, and I look forward to it.</p>
      <p>‘When I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people.</p>
      <p>‘Ukraine was always very well represented.’</p>

      <p>Trump owned the pageant between 1996 and 2015, while he was a property developer and reality TV star.</p>
      <p>The White House released the memo of a call between the men as the second day of public impeachment proceedings which could end Trump’s presidency kicked off.</p>

      <p>Trump is accused of suggesting Ukraine would only receive $400million in military aid if Zelensky instructed his country’s prosecutors to dig dirt on his political rivals Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>Democrats say that alleged behavior constitutes Trump abusing his office to advance his own political campaign, although the president denies any wrongdoing.</p>

      <p>The call which prompted the impeachment campaign took place in July, with the transcript released Friday an innocuous call of congratulations from Trump to Zelensky after he was elected president.</p>
      <p>Trump congratulated Zelensky on ‘a fantastic election’ and told his Ukrainian counterpart ‘I think you will do a great job.’</p>
      <p>Zelensky returned the compliment by hailing Trump as ‘a great example’ to his new administration, and asked him to visit the Ukraine.</p>
      <p>He also stressed that Ukraine was ‘an independent country.’</p>
      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin had his country’s military annex the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, a territory previously held by Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Russia has since been accused of aggression towards Ukraine, which was previously part of the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>And Trump has repeatedly been accused of being too soft on Putin.</p>
      <p>Critics say he knew full well how important the US aid package was to Ukraine to help protect its borders when he made the call to Zelensky.</p>
