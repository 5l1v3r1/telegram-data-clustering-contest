      <h2>It's perfect for families</h2>

      <p>The homely caravans, breathtaking sea views and stunning scenery are just a few of the factors which makes Holgates holiday park so amazing.</p>
      <p>Situated in an Area of Outstanding Beauty just next to Morecambe Bay are a flock of inviting green caravans which make up Holgates Silverdale Holiday Park.</p>
      <p>Perfect for nature lovers, the site is set in the middle of a woodland with stunning sea views and beach walks to be enjoyed.</p>
      <p>Warming gastropub food is just a 20 minute walk away, or you can choose to cook in your caravan which is docked out with everything you need for cooking.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the caravans like?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Simply amazing.</p>
      <p>The caravan was absolutely pristine and smelt brand new.</p>
      <p>It was spacious too - the lounge had plenty of space for the four of us and the three bedrooms provided us with room to relax.</p>
      <p>We stayed in the three bedroom caravan which was totally luxorious. It also had a sofa bed which means it could house even more guests.</p>
      <p>The site has more than 350 caravans altogether, with the majority being holiday home owners and the rest available for hire.</p>
      <p>It also has camping pods, touring pitches and tents.</p>

      <p>
        <b>What can you do there?</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is an endless list of things to do just a small walk away from the caravans - making the park perfect for families.</p>
      <p>Children can enjoy the indoor heated swimming pool, bowling alley, soft play area and outdoor playground.</p>
      <p>And for the adults, a sauna, steam room, gym and nine hole pitch and putt can be enjoyed on the site.</p>
      <p>The hot tub was a particular highlight, especially with its views looking out into the beautiful setting of the caravan site.</p>
      <p>The site itself itself is situated in 100 acres of grounds, meaning you don't even need to leave the site for a scenic walk.</p>

        <figcaption>There are stunning beach walks just next to the caravan site<cite>(Image: Derby Telegraph)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Outside of the site there are also plenty of ways to stay entertained.</p>
      <p>A short walk away is the beach front where you can take a stroll while watching the sun go down.</p>
      <p>Holgates is also within an hour's drive of the Lakes. On a rainy day we drove half an hour to Kendal, which was perfect for a day of shopping.</p>
      <p>The coastal town of Morecambe was also a nice day trip from the site. We had a beach walk and there's a play area there which is great for kids.</p>
      <p>Further afield, you can also drive to the Yorkshire Dales and the Forest of Bowland.</p>

      <p>
        <b>What can you eat there?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The caravan is equipped with everything you need to cook meals.</p>
      <p>But if you fancy a meal out, you can visit the on-site restaurant and bar which serves delicious freshly prepared meals as well as snacks and cakes throughout the day.</p>
      <p>The restaurant is situated right next to the swimming pool, meaning you can have a morning swim and tuck in to a hearty lunch afterwards.</p>
      <p>Amazingly, there's also an ice cream parlour stocked up with locally made ice creams.</p>
      <p>Just down the road is the centre of Silverdale, where you can find shops, a takeaway and restaurants.</p>
      <p>We loved The Royal Silverdale, a cosy gastropub serving fresh food and a range of locally sourced beers and a huge list of flavoured gins.</p>
