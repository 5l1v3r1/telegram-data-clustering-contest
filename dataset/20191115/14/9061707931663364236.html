      <h1>'Better deal' - Update on Luciano Acosta's transfer link with Derby County</h1>
      <h2>Derby County transfer news | Wayne Rooney has reportedly told his former DC United team-mate to join him at Pride Park in January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:13:58+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>There has been an update on the reported interest from <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> in DC United midfielder <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/who-luciano-acosta-profile-dc-3533464">Luciano Acosta</a> .</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-lucharoo-3530596">interview in Argentina</a>, Acosta claimed his former DC United team-mate, Derby-bound <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney">Wayne Rooney</a>, had told him to join him at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>Rooney joins the Rams as a player-coach in January after spending nearly two years in the United States with the MLS outfit.</p>
      <p>Acosta has also called time on his DC United career, and is looking for a new club.</p>
      <p>Fresh reports in <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/?source=googleuksearchads&amp;ad_id=394570647773&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw-3n-rLs5QIVh7PtCh1MvQ-zEAAYASABEgJf_PD_BwE">The Athletic</a> claim that Acosta is “waiting for the call” from Derby over a potential move, but there has been no sign from the Rams that deal could take place.</p>
      <p>The report also adds that Acosta could be “leveraging his situation in order to get a better deal”, with Boca Juniors also reportedly in the running for his signature.</p>
