      <p>Julia’s character Shona has had an incredibly tough year thus far, what with fiancé David (Jack P Shepherd) ending up behind bars. Matters were made worse when — just weeks away from his imminent release — he ended up in trouble when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/coronation-street-spoilers-david-platt-jailed-josh-tucker-lies-stabbing-11017085/">he was accused</a> of stabbing rapist Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton).</p>

      <p>Eventually <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/coronation-street-spoilers-new-evidence-frees-david-platt-tonight-ahead-wedding-shona-ramsey-11050782/">Josh revealed the truth</a>, which meant that David and Shona were able to get married — moments after he was released from prison.</p>
      <p>Although Julia’s on maternity leave, we’re not quite sure what will lead to Shona taking some time away from the cobbles, but given everything the character’s been through over the past couple of months, she certainly deserves a holiday!</p>
