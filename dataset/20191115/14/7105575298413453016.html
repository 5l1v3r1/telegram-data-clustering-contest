      <p>Katie Holmes is in Australia for McHappy Day, and she got a chance to visit with families at the Ronald McDonald House Westmead. And she wore the prettiest petal-pink suit while she was there, with a pink tee underneath.</p>
      <p>Holmes tagged stylist Allison Bornstein and Australian designer Zimmerman. The suit is Zimmerman's Super Eight Jacket and Wide Leg Trouser.</p>
      <p>It's actually quite thoughtful on her end. Since she's in Australia at a public event, she's wearing an Australian designer.</p>
      <p>Except for her black pointed-toe pumps, she was basically in head-to-toe pink, and it's lovely. It's springtime in Australia, so that makes her choice even more appropriate.</p>
      <p>Unlike the brand's edit, she decided to put something underneath the blazer to make it a little more modest. Considering she's at an event with kids, that makes sense to me.</p>
      <p>Instead of white pumps, she went with a darker shoe. Normally I might have just said embrace something light, but looking at her top-to-bottom I actually think it's fine since she has dark hair.</p>
      <p>Plus, as you'll see below, she tied the color in with a darker bag that she took off when she got to the event. Honestly, Holmes cannot lose at this point—everything she's worn this year becomes an instant fashion classic.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at the full outfit:</p>

      <p>Holmes also shared a photo of herself accessorizing with a fab leopard bag, which ties in with the shoes and offers a nice bit of visual contrast to the femininity of the rest of the outfit:</p>
