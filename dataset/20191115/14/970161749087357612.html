      <p>Another intense battle of he-said, she-said is continuing to play out between <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> and Big Machine Records owners Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta.</p>
      <p>After Taylor took to social media on Thursday <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swift-reignites-scooter-braun-feud-encourages-fans-go-manager-claims-blocked-performing-songs-11148397/">to call out the pair for ‘banning’ her from performing her old tracks</a> at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> or featuring them in an upcoming Netflix project, the record company has hit back with equally shocking claims about the situation.</p>
      <p>‘As Taylor Swift’s partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her Tumblr statements yesterday based on false information,’<a href="https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/big-machine-records-denies-taylor-swift-claims-scott-borchetta-scooter-braun-1203406009/"> their statement began</a>.</p>
      <p>‘At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere.’</p>

      <p>It continued: ‘Since Taylor’s decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.</p>
      <p>‘The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career.’</p>
      <p>The statement then read: ‘We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward.</p>

      <p>‘We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved.’</p>
      <p>It continued: ‘However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families.</p>
      <p>‘Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side.’</p>

      <p>The statement concluded: ‘To date, not one of the invitations to speak with us and work through this has been accepted. Rumors fester in the absence of communication.</p>

      <p>‘Let’s not have that continue here. We share the collective goal of giving your fans the entertainment they both want and deserve.’</p>
      <p>Taylor’s yet to respond to BMR’s new claims but something tells us the fight is far from over between these two.</p>
