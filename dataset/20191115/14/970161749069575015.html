      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a> has revealed how he’s desperate to find out from fellow campmate Caitlin Jenner if OJ Simpson was really a murderer.</p>
      <p>Robert Kardashian, who was married to Caitlin’s ex Kris Jenner was part of OJ’s defence team when he was initially cleared of killing his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.</p>
      <p>During the infamous trial, OJ was asked by the prosecution to try on a pair of gloves that was connected to the murders – and now the Rak-Su singer is eager to find out more.</p>
      <p>Myles told The Sun: ‘The first thing I’m going to ask Caitlyn is, “Did OJ do it? Does the glove really fit?”‘</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/04/12/caitlyn-jenner-sensationally-claims-the-late-robert-kardashian-believed-oj-simpson-was-guilty-6570182/">Caitlin has always been quite vocal about the OJ trial and in extracts from her memoir The Secrets Of My Life</a>, she admits that during a car ride with Robert he once told her that he ‘would’ve been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial.</p>

      <p>‘The implication was obvious that he believed OJ was guilty.’</p>

      <p>The 28-year-old went on to explain that while he is unsure of what will happen after the show, his fellow bandmates have been nothing but supportive of him.</p>

      <p>‘I would love to stay in the band but if other opportunities come along my way as well after this, you have to take it by the scruff of the neck.</p>
      <p>‘They would do the same. I would never hold them back.’</p>
