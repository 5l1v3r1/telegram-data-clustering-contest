      <p>A couple of months ago, the tenure of Francis Wangusi as the Communications Authority’s Director-General came to an end. The obvious step was appointing his replacement.</p>
      <p>Wangusi, however, was not ready to hand over the baton to Ms. Wanjau due to some technicalities such as lack of a board to make such appointments. Later on, a 13-member board was constituted.<a href="https://techweez.com/2019/08/22/mercy-wanjau-new-dg-ca-kenya/"> Ms. Wanjau was then appointed as interim DG</a>, but people close to the matter as argued the exercise (selection of a new board, and the appointment of Ms. Wanjau) was not done according to the constitution.</p>
      <p>Popular activist and lawyer Okiya Omtata, among other people, sought the input of the courts, which they expected would revoke the appointment of Mercy Wanjau.</p>
      <p>In the time that court deliberations have dragged on, the Acting DG performed her duties, and, as expected, received backing from the CA.</p>
      <p>However, today’s court ruling has reinstated Francis Wangusi’s position, meaning Ms. Wnajau is no longer serving the DG office.</p>
      <p>The board has also been disbanded. A new one will be selected in the coming days. Until that happens, Francis Wangusi will be CA’s CEO.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that Wangusi’s tenure had expired, so he won’t steer the ICT regulator for long.</p>
