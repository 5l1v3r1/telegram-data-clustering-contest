      <h1>Jan Blachowicz not holding breath on fighting UFC champ Jon Jones after ‘Jacare’ Souza</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p>Just days before he received an offer to face <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/395/ronaldo-souza">Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza</a> in the main event of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1055/ufc-fight-night-sao-paulo">UFC Sao Paulo</a>, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/620/jan-blachowicz">Jan Blachowicz</a> thought there was a genuine possibility he might get the next shot at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/47/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a>.</p>
      <p>With a 5-1 record in his past six fights, including a devastating second-round knockout against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/98/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a> that broke the former middleweight champion’s jaw, Blachowicz was in early talks to potentially face the UFC’s light heavyweight king.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz never allowed himself to get too excited, because conversations don’t always equal contracts.</p>
      <p>“We talked with the UFC about Jon Jones; we tried to make it, but it didn’t happen,” Blachowicz said in an interview with MMA Fighting. “Something went wrong; even <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a> said in some interview that they wanted to make the fight, but after one day, they changed their minds and we got the fight against ‘Jacare.’”</p>
      <p>The end goal remains the same for the Polish standout – to compete for the light heavyweight title. But if there are good fights along the way, he won’t blink.</p>
      <p>“(It’s) also a pleasure for me to fight against someone like that, because he’s also a legend,” Blachowicz said.</p>
      <p>A world-class grappler, former Strikeforce champ and a perennial UFC contender, Souza presents his own problems. He’s the latest middleweight to move up to 205 pounds.</p>
      <p>“Jacare” joins a growing group of 185-pound fighters—including former champions in Rockhold and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/352/chris-weidman">Chris Weidman</a> and veterans such as <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1091/anthony-smith">Anthony Smith</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/938/thiago-santos">Thiago Santos</a>—who have gone bigger as they’ve aged.</p>
      <p>The results for that quartet has been mixed, but Blachowicz treats “Jacare” as a dangerous opponent rather than worrying about how he’ll adjust to fighting at 205 pounds.</p>
      <p>“You have to be prepared for the best in every fight,” Blachowicz said. “For me, it’s another opponent. I don’t think he’s going to change his ways coming to my division. I’m going to prepare for the best version of ‘Jacare.’</p>
      <p>“I don’t care if it’s someone cutting down from heavyweight, or moving up from middleweight to light heavyweight. It’s just another opponent, and I have to do a great job.”</p>
      <p>Because Souza will give up size and power this weekend, there’s a distinct possibility the Brazilian will turn to grappling to negate Blachowicz’s biggest advantages.</p>
      <p>If that’s his strategy, Blachowicz welcomes the Brazilian’s takedown attempts. He has no fear going to the canvas with anybody in the UFC.</p>
      <p>“If he finds a way to take me down, I’ll be ready for his jiu-jitsu,” he said. “I’m also a black belt in jiu-jitsu, so I will not be afraid of his jiu-jitsu game. I would like to keep the fight on the feet and try to knock him out.</p>
      <p>“MMA is not jiu-jitsu. MMA is not boxing. MMA is not wrestling. It’s a different kind of style of punching and wrestling and grappling on the ground. We will see. If the fight goes to the ground, I will try to submit him. I will try to control him on the ground and punch him in the face. I will be ready for his tricks.”</p>
      <p>If Blachowicz is victorious this weekend, he’ll take another step toward that light heavyweight title. But given his recent past, he’s not wasting too much time thinking about it.</p>
      <p>Jones has been teasing a fight against undefeated light heavyweight contender <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4111/dominick-reyes">Dominick Reyes</a> in the near future. There are just too many unknowns to contemplate what the champ does next.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz believes he should be in line for a title shot with a win, but with Jones voicing doubts about the current crop of light heavyweight contenders, he’s not holding his breath.</p>
      <p>“Nobody knows, because nobody knows what Jon Jones will do,” Blachowicz said. “I believe if I beat ‘Jacare’ I’m going to be a contender for the title shot. But nobody knows what (Jones) has in his head. We’ll just have to wait and see what’s going to happen.”</p>
