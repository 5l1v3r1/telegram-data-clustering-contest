      <p>Final Fantasy 14 is coming to Xbox One at some point.</p>
      <p>Xbox One players will finally be able to enjoy Square Enix’s <b>Final Fantasy 14</b>.</p>
      <p>According to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, the MMORPG will be coming to the console in the future.</p>
      <p>We had heard the game was coming to Xbox One, but because FF14 wasn’t <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/14/ten-final-fantasy-titles-coming-xbox-game-pass/">one of the ten Final Fantasy games</a> announced last night, we didn’t share the news from our source.</p>
      <p>But speaking with the press after the x019 show, Spencer assured folks Microsoft and Square Enix were working on a solution.</p>
      <p>“The astute people out there might have noticed there’s one Final Fantasy that’s missing in our list: number 14. 14 is one I’ve been dedicated to working with Yoshida-san on to find a solution to bring that game to Xbox,” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-microsofts-phil-spencer-promises-final-fantasy-14-is-coming-to-xbox">per Eurogamer</a> (<b>thanks,</b> <b>smd</b>)  “And while it’s not in the news today, I wanted you to know, rest assured, that we will be bringing that game to Xbox.</p>
      <p>“We have a great relationship with Yoshida-san, and we’re working through what it means to bring a cross-platform MMO that they’ve run for years. But it will be one of the games that’s coming and it’s something I know our Xbox fans will be incredibly excited to see.”</p>

      <p>When the MMO was revamped as Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn and released on PC and PS3, many wondered why it was absent from Microsoft’s current console at the time, Xbox 360.</p>
      <p>According to Square, it was due to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2013/07/09/final-fantasy-14-a-realm-reborns-xbox-360-snub-is-due-to-microsofts-policies-says-square/">Microsoft policies preventing cross-play</a> between PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. The firm did not wish to divide the community as PC and PlayStation users were, and still are, able to play together.</p>
      <p>Things have changed since then, as Microsoft is now keen on cross-play between platforms. Sony is still a holdout in some instances of cross-play between platforms but has relented a bit recently.</p>
