      <h1>Euroboden reveals design of "brutalist" Hammerschmidt office in Munich</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:00:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/dezeen-staff/" target="_blank">Dezeen staff</a></address>
      <p><b>Dezeen promotion:</b> Euroboden has revealed visuals of a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/concrete/">concrete</a> office building near Munich, Germany, designed by Arno Brandlhuber and Muck Petzet.</p>
      <p>Named Hammerschmidt, the linear "brutalist structure" will measure 16,000 square-metres and contain a series of customisable workspaces available to rent by businesses of any kind.</p>
      <p>Working in collaboration with architects Brandlhuber and Petzet, who recently completed <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/02/21/teressenhaus-studio-brandlhuber-emde-burlon-muck-petzet-architecture/">a concrete mixed-use block in Berlin</a>, it challenges <a href="https://www.euroboden.de/">Euroboden's</a> typical design of high-end apartment blocks.</p>

      <p>"Known in the past for its upscale apartment buildings, Euroboden is currently developing an entirely new species of building – a structure suited for contemporary forms of work," said the Munich-based real estate developer.</p>
      <p>"The Hammerschmidt will offer customisable and freely arrangeable rental spaces to pionieering businesses of every size and sort."</p>

      <p>Located in the outskirts of Munich, the Hammerschmidt office block will be surrounded by greenery and will be raised on stilts over a semi-open car park lined with trees and small gardens.</p>
      <p>Above, it will contain highly flexible office spaces of at least 340 square-metres that tenants will be able to combine, reconfigure, and expand as required – hoped to encourage "interaction and community".</p>

      <p>Each storey of workspaces will be orientated around three open-air stairwells staggered across the building.</p>
      <p>An open-air cascading stairwell alongside the entire northern facade these will double as "key community zone", providing occupants with informal outdoor meeting-places during work breaks.</p>

      <p>Occupants will also be encouraged to relax on a shared rooftop terrace that will an open skydeck with panoramic views, a fitness track, bleacher-like seating, a pool and community garden.</p>

      <p>Spacious concrete balconies that will wrap around the structure and floor-to-ceiling glazing will ensure that all the workspaces have direct access to the outside and are filled with daylight.</p>
      <p>The block will be topped with a rooftop terrace containing a fitness track, an open flight of stairs, a reflecting pool and community gardening, which will have panoramic views towards the Alps.</p>

      <p>"The architecture is both the medium and message: the Hammerschmidt is a holistically thought-through workplace, a 'raw structure with soft skills', in which new work cultures and an updated conception of work-life balance find their spatial analogue," said Euroboden.</p>
      <p>Sustainable design will also play a key part in the design of Hammerschmidt. The concrete frame's thermal mass is hoped to provide a comfortable and balanced indoor climate, and the building will also make use of groundwater heat pumps.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the large windows will be fully openable to allow for natural ventilation, while on the south-facing facade exterior textile curtains will shield off the sun when needed.</p>
