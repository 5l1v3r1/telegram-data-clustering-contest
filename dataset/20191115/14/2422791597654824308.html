      <h1>Nike released a shoe for 'everyday heroes' like doctors, nurses and home health aides</h1>

      <p>Nike's new shoe was not created for athletes, such as basketball players or tennis players, but for a different crowd -- medical workers.</p>
      <p>Nike Air Zoom Pulse is an athletic shoe designed for those in the medical profession. <a href="https://news.nike.com/news/nike-air-zoom-pulse">Nike said in a news release</a> that they had "everyday heroes" specifically in mind.</p>
      <p>The company went to OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, Oregon, to study those in the profession. They took into account the challenges of those on the job-- including long hours on their feet and liquid spills -- and the comfort needed for long shifts.</p>
      <p>The shoe is designed like a clog, an industry favorite, but is just made more athletic, Nike said. "The fit, cushioning and traction systems work together to secure the foot in all hospital conditions."</p>
      <p>The shoe has a laceless upper and an elastic strap keeps the heel securely contained. Nike said this makes the shoe easy to get on with one hand. It has a durable, full-rubber outsole with a sole that provides traction even when liquid or water is present.</p>
