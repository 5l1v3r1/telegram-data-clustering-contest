      <h1>Corrie fans spot hilarious blunder as ITV announces Sinead won't attend her own funeral</h1>
      <h2>The video on Coronation Street's official YouTube channel was meant to say that Daniel wouldn't be at the funeral</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:08:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Coronation Street fans were left in stitches after ITV made an embarrassing blunder on the soap's official YouTube channel.</p>
      <p>The account featured a video announcing that the late Sinead Tinker wouldn't be able to attend her own funeral in an upcoming episode.</p>
      <p>It was captioned: "Ken breaks the news that Sinead won't be attending Sinead's funeral."</p>
      <p>It was obviously meant to say that Daniel Osbourne wouldn't be attending the service and it was quickly changed - but not before the mistake was noticed by eagled eyed fans on Reddit.</p>
      <p>One Redditor jokingly commented: "Imagine not attending your own funeral! Talk about ungrateful."</p>

      <p>"They're taking the mickey now," another posted.</p>
      <p>A third said: "At least they've fixed this one, usually they just leave them wrong forever."</p>
      <p>The video was advertising an episode where Daniel said he couldn't go to his late wife's funeral and decided to leave Weatherfield.</p>

      <p>But he will turn up just in time to pay his respects.</p>
      <p>He reads a eulogy and has the mourners in tears, except her auntie Beth.</p>
      <p>Beth is still furious with Daniel for betraying Sinead with Bethany Platt while his wife lay dying.</p>

      <p>Corrie fans were left in tears last month when Sinead lost her battle with cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>She was diagnosed while she was pregnant but had been given the all clear, before she was told it had returned and spead.</p>
