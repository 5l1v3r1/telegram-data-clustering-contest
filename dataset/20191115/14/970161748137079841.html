      <p>While many humans still don’t understand the concept of putting rubbish in the bin instead of on the floor, one border collie is a step ahead of them all.</p>
      <p>Six-year-old Stan is on a mission to help clean up the planet by picking up dropped rubbish on his walks.</p>
      <p>Owner Kate Oakes, 48, says Stan sniffs out litter on their country strolls together in order to keep the area tidy.</p>
      <p>The pair’s hard work has received an ‘amazing’ response from the community in Brynmawr, South Wales.</p>
      <p>Dental hygienist Kate said: ‘Stan needs to be walked a couple of times a day and it is important to keep the area tidy, so now we do both.</p>
      <p>‘We generally get an amazing response from people who see us, and they love the fact that Stan helps with the clean up.’</p>

      <p>The reaction has been so good that Kate has even started group litter picks to encourage more people to get involved.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I hope people see what me and Stan are doing and get inspired to do a bit themselves.</p>

      <p>‘It really is a beautiful place and its such a shame to see people treating it like this.</p>
      <p>‘Everybody is welcome to come along and take part, and I would encourage anyone to help with the group litter picks or even go out on their own if they get chance.</p>
      <p>‘It really does make a big difference as we want Brynmawr to be a place we can all be proud of.</p>
      <p>‘I started doing this about two-and-a-half years ago when I would take Stan for a walk and see litter everywhere.</p>
      <p>‘I work full time but I don’t mind doing this as well.</p>
      <p>‘It definitely makes a difference in keeping the town clean and Stan loves to be out of the house as well.’</p>
      <p>Councillor Wayne Hodgins, of Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council, who also takes part in the rubbish clearing, says Kate and Stan are doing a ‘fantastic job’.</p>

      <p>‘We also want to educate people to stop throwing litter in the first place as that could have a big impact in reducing the mess long term.’</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman from fly-tipping Action Wales group said: ‘This is Fantastic work being carried out by Kate and her wonderful dog Stan in helping the local community to clean up cases of fly-tipping in the Brynmawr area.</p>
      <p>‘A case of Kate and her best friend working in perfect harmony and making a real difference. Keep up the great work all.’</p>
