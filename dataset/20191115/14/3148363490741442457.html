      <h2>Facebook has said that its policy against naming the alleged “whistleblower” on the platform remains in effect, even though he has been publicly named by <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/13/rand-paul-eric-ciaramella-needs-to-be-pulled-in-for-testimony/">Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)</a> and <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/12/rep-dan-bishop-names-alleged-impeachment-whistleblower-hes-not-voldemort/">Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC)</a>.</h2>

      <p>The social network has been deleting posts and suspending pages that name the alleged whistleblower, Eric Ciaramella. A number of Breitbart News posts naming Ciaramella were taken down last week, along with posts by other conservative media organizations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/11/08/facebook-removes-any-news-reporting-on-or-even-mention-of-who-the-whistleblower-is-alleged-to-be/">In a comment to Breitbart News last week,</a> a Facebook spokesman said that the social network will “revisit this decision should their name be widely published in the media or used by public figures in debate.”</p>
      <p>Since Facebook gave that assurance, the alleged whistleblower’s name has been publicly mentioned by two U.S. lawmakers, Sen. Paul and Rep. Bishop.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, a Facebook spokesman told Breitbart News that the policy against naming the alleged whistleblower remains in effect.</p>
