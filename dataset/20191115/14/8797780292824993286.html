      <p>I don’t know about you guys, but I want the technology of today in the form factor styling of yesterday! <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/technology/motorola-is-bringing-the-coolest-phone-of-the-2000s-the-razr-back-as-a-foldable-smartphone/">I’m getting just that with the Motorola RAZR</a>, a new take on an old classic for a stupidly expensive price and by the gods do I want it bad. I MEAN LOOK AT IT, IT FOLDS AND STUFF! For entertainment fans who can’t get enough of Henry Cavill in a bathtub, good news! You’ll be seeing more of his square-jawed two-fisted action soon enough, <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/entertainment/netflixs-the-witcher-already-renewed-for-a-second-season/">as The Witcher isn’t even out yet and a second season has been greenlit</a>.</p>
      <p>Oh and did I mention yet <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/entertainment/sonic-the-hedgehog-looks-so-much-better-in-this-new-trailer/">how much better Sonic the Hedgehog looks</a> since he had a facelift?</p>
      <h3>Worst story of the week</h3>

      <p>I <i>like </i>the idea of Google Stadia. I don’t so much like <i>how </i>it’s being implemented though and <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/project-xcloud-is-coming-to-windows-10-launches-in-2020/">now that Microsoft have announced their plans Project xCloud</a>, Stadia just continues to feel more and more outlcassed every single day by a far superior service. Perhaps the final nail in its coffin (and it has barely launched yet which is already worrying), <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/technology/reddit-ama-reveals-that-a-lot-of-functionality-will-be-missing-from-stadia-at-launch/">is just how barebones the service is going to be</a>.</p>
      <p>Will it get more substantial upgrades in the days to come? Undoubtedly, but if the game streaming wars are about to begin then seeing this service already on the backfoot isn’t exactly a great start.</p>
      <h3>WTF story of the week</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s weird just how much fandoms can attract that tiny vocal minority whose sheer presence can drown out the good nature and positivity of the larger fanbase. Pokémon is one such franchise with such a problem, as the launch of the Swor and Shield games have been mired in overwhelming hostility and negativity from a small contingent of players who’ll <i>never </i>be happy. I usually like catching a few Poison-type mons, <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/ahead-of-pokmon-sword-and-shields-launch-vocal-hardcore-fans-are-becoming-increasingly-toxic/">but these people take a toxic nature to a whole new and ugly level</a>. And don’t even get me started on Airplane Mode, <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/experience-the-pure-hell-of-last-class-air-travel-in-airplane-mode/">a new game that captures the tedium of air travel</a>.</p>
      <p>Also…<a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/entertainment/star-wars-han-vs-greedo-scene-changed-again-for-disney-and-it-makes-no-sense/">MACLUNKEY</a>! MAAAAAAAAACLUUUUUUUUUNKEEEEEEEEEY!</p>
