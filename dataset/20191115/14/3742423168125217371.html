      <p>Just when you thought watching your favourite movies under the stars couldn’t get any better, Openair Cinemas has gone and upped the deal with free Chicken Waffle Cones. Here are the details!</p>
      <blockquote>This article is sponsored by Red Rooster. Try their new Chicken Waffle Cones ASAP.</blockquote>
      <p>For the month of November, Red Rooster will be bringing its brand new menu item to the Openair Cinemas in Pyrmont, NSW and St Kilda, VIC for everyone to eat for free.</p>
