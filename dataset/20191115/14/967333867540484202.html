      <p>The US government has paid Russia nearly $4 billion to transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) via its Soyuz rockets since July, a report, compiled by the NASA Inspector General Paul Martin, said.</p>
      <blockquote>"As of July 2019, NASA had purchased 70 Soyuz seats worth $3.9 billion to ferry 70 U.S. and partner astronauts to and from the [International Space] Station", the report said.</blockquote>
      <p>The report also stipulates that the United States will likely be forced to reduce the number of its ISS crew, since new space flight systems are not ready yet.</p>
      <blockquote>"While awaiting the start of commercial crew flights, NASA will likely experience a reduction in the number of USOS [US Orbital Segment] crew aboard the ISS from three to one beginning in spring 2020 given schedule delays in the development of Boeing and SpaceX space flight systems coupled with a reduction in the frequency of Soyuz flights", the report read on.</blockquote>
      <p>As a result, US astronauts will focus on ISS maintenance instead of experiments and research, NASA suggested.</p>
      <p>As the Space Shuttle program was terminated in 2011, the US <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201910211077108316-iran-to-discuss-possibility-of-sending-its-astronaut-to-iss-with-russia----space-agency/">lost its ability</a> to arrange manned ISS flights on its own. Since 2014, private companies SpaceX and Boeing have been constructing manned spacecraft under a contract with NASA, but the deadline for their commissioning has not been set yet. NASA is currently mulling over buying seats aboard Russia's Soyuz in 2020.</p>
