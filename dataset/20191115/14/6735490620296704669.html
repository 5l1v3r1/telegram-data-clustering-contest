      <p>“I think his legacy is never going to go away and think that is a responsibility that I feel, to carry his and my mother’s legacy on for the rest of my life and hopefully beyond that,” Will told <a href="https://people.com/movies/christopher-reeve-son-will-reeve-remembers-dad-15-years-after-death/"><i>People</i></a>. “I think that the foundation is one way, one tangible way, that his legacy and my mom’s legacy will always live on. And I think the way that I, and my siblings, live our lives is another way. And I think that his impact is felt by the millions of lives that he touched.</p>
      <p>Will noted that many fans tell him his father was their “favourite Superman, but more than being their favourite Superman, they say, ‘He was one of my favourite people because he inspired them in ways that had nothing to do with movies.</p>

      <p>“I think that the people who have the most lasting impact on culture are people who made a real difference in the world beyond whatever it is that they were initially known for,” he continued. “And I think that my dad is certainly one of those people … he had an impact on the world well beyond his fleeting fame for being in movies. And I think that he was a change agent in the world, and those are the people who last, and that is why he has lasted.”</p>
      <p>Reeve passed away in 2004. He had been left quadriplegic in 1995 after being thrown from a horse during a competition.</p>
