      <h1>Instagram test of hiding 'likes' spreads to Indonesia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:37:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:37</time> by <a rel="author">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Beginning on Friday, some Instagram users in Indonesia won’t be able to view the like counts on other users’ posts.</p>
      <p>The social media company is testing a plan to omit like counts and encourage users to focus on posts instead of their number of likes. </p>
      <p>Users who are part of the test were picked randomly and won’t be able to see how many likes posts appearing on their feed have.</p>

      <p>However, they will still be able to see how many likes they have received by tapping the “like” option under their posts.</p>
      <p>“We have heard positive reviews from users that are part of this test, therefore we’d like to hear from our users in other countries as well,” Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The test was previously conducted in countries like Australia, Brazil and Canada for several months before reaching Indonesia. (vel/wng)</p>
