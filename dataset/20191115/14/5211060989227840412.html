      <p>TORONTO – A 19-year-old woman accused of throwing a chair off a downtown Toronto high-rise balcony is expected to plead guilty this morning.</p>
      <p>Marcella Zoia arrived at Old City Hall through a back entrance just before her 10 a.m. court appearance wearing all black and large sunglasses.</p>

      <p>She told CTV News Toronto that she will be pleading guilty in connection with a February incident that was caught on camera and shared widely online.</p>
      <p>The video showed a young woman launch a chair off a balcony over a busy highway.</p>

      <p>Following the mass-circulation of the video, Toronto police urged the woman to come forward and identify herself.</p>
      <p>Zoia turned herself in to officials a few days later.</p>
      <p>She was subsequently charged with mischief endangering life, mischief endangering property under $5,000 and common nuisance.</p>
      <p>Last month, the woman’s lawyer Gregory Leslie said the case was close to a resolution.</p>
