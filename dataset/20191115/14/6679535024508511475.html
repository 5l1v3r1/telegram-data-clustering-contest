      <p>Tension prevailed at Venmony, near Chengannur, on Friday when the police brought two Bangladesh nationals, accused in the murder of an elderly couple, for evidence gathering.</p>
      <p>A.P. Cherian, 75, and his wife Lillykutty Cherian, 68, of Anjilimoottil Vadakkethil, Venmony, were found murdered at their home on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The police brought Labilu and Juval, who were arrested in connection with the case, to the couple’s house in the afternoon. However, when they were returning after evidence collection, local people and relatives, who turned up in large numbers on the premises of the house, approached the duo and tried to attack them.</p>
      <p>This resulted in a minor scuffle and tension. The police, however, hurried the duo into the vehicle and sped away. The accused were later produced before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chengannur, and remanded in judicial custody.</p>
      <p>The police had nabbed Labilu and Juval, migrant labourers, from Coromandel Express on Tuesday night in a joint operation carried out by the Visakhapatnam city police, Railway Police and Railway Protection Force (RPF). The duo were brought to Alappuzha on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to media persons here on Friday, Kaliraj Mahesh Kumar, DIG (Ernakulam Range), said that Bangladesh passports had been recovered from the accused. The police had also recovered 45 sovereign gold and ₹17,000 in cash from them, allegedly stolen from the couple's house.</p>
      <p>Officials said the suspects had reached Chennai from Kerala after committing the crime. They then boarded the Howrah-bound train. Based on an information provided by the Kerala police, the accused were taken into custody from the train at Visakhapatnam. The duo were trying to flee to Bangladesh via Kolkata, the police said.</p>
