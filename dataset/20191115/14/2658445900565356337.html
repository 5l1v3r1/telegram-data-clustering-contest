      <p>Nigeria is still in dire need of transformational and godly leadership and followership to reposition the country and holistically tackle corruption, Nigeria Fellowship of Evangelical Students (NIFS), has said.</p>
      <p>It noted that for Nigeria to move forward, it must ensure that character, integrity and good work ethics are enshrined and enthroned into the fabrics of the nation.</p>
      <p>NIFES National Director, Rex Onuh, said this during a media briefing ahead of the organisation’s 2019 National Missions Conference in Abuja.</p>
      <p>He said: “Nigeria as a nation is still in dire need of transformational and godly leadership and followership to reposition the country and holistically tackle corruption.</p>
      <p>“Again, we have to move forward as a nation. Character, integrity and work ethics must be enshrined and enthroned into the fabrics of our nation if we must be the envy of other nations in the world.</p>

      <p>“Our value system needs to change as a people and the rule of law has to reign in Nigeria. Citizens of this nation must be secured from all man-made catastrophes and disasters.</p>
      <p>“The government needs to be more proactive with the security of lives and properties of its citizens. The educational sector where our supposed future leaders are being formed should receive proper attention both from government and private organisations.</p>
      <p>He said that God’s expectation is that our work and involvement with the society in any form should impact lives positively and that such should be done with integrity and reference to God.</p>
      <p>“It is lack of this understanding that has made us as a nation to nose-dive into corruption, injustice, insecurity, kidnapping and all forms of social vices that has bedeviled our nation.</p>
      <p>“If we get it right with the youths, the future of our dear country would be secured and ultimately our society would be impacted positively.”</p>
