      <p>Derrick Williams has been ruled out of the Republic of Ireland’s final Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark through injury.</p>
      <p>The Blackburn defender, who scored his first senior international goal in Thursday night’s 3-1 friendly victory over New Zealand, has returned to his club for treatment on a calf problem sustained during the game.</p>
      <p>Ireland boss Mick McCarthy said: “Derrick felt his calf in the second half of the game and our medical team have assessed him today.</p>

      <p>“He will go back to his club now and we wish him well. He was one of our best players on Thursday night and deserved his goal.”</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old Celtic full-back Lee O’Connor, who made his senior debut for Ireland against the All Whites, has also left the squad, in his case to rejoin Stephen Kenny’s under-21s.</p>
      <p>O’Connor was suspended for Thursday’s 1-0 European Championship qualifying win in Armenia, but is available once again for Tuesday’s clash with Sweden at Tallaght Stadium.</p>

      <p>The manager has no plans to add to a squad which now comprises 25 men ahead of Monday night’s concluding Group D fixture.</p>
      <p>Those players who were not involved against New Zealand trained at Abbotstown on Friday afternoon, while those who were underwent a recovery session.</p>
      <p>The players and management team are due to watch Denmark’s penultimate qualifier against Gibraltar on television at the team hotel on Friday evening.</p>
