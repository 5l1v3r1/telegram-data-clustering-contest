      <h1>Charity fundraiser was a real cut above the rest</h1>
      <h2>Niamh Jackson, aged 10, chopped off her locks so that her fair hair can be donated to the Little Princess Trust.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:50:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Behan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-behan/</a></address>
      <p>The Kingcase Primary School girl went to Tracy Conn Hairdressing in Ayr High Street to have the locks shorn.</p>
      <p>Niamh’s hair will be turned into a wig for a young cancer patient.</p>
      <p>Proud mum Fiona said: “Me and my husband Kevin are incredibly proud of Niamh and her generosity.</p>
      <p>“She actually wanted to do it last year but she bottled it.</p>
      <p>“But I spoke to her this year about the possibility of donating some of her hair and it going to a wee child who is undergoing therapy. It was then that she decided to do it this time around.”</p>
      <p>Fiona added: “Niamh’s Justgiving page stands at £520 and that is going to Cancer Research UK and £100, raised from family and friends, is going to the SSPCA because she just loves animals.</p>
      <p>“We’re really proud of her.”</p>
