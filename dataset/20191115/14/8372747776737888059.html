      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- Floridians are breaking the bank on utility bills.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.move.org/utility-bills-101/">move.org study</a> , Florida has the second highest utility bills in the country.</p>
      <p>On average, Floridians are paying more than $450 a month on utilities, including electricity, water, cable television, internet, trash/recycling and natural gas.</p>
      <p>According to the study, one of the reason Floridians pay so much is due to air conditioning units running most of the year to beat the heat and humidity.</p>
      <p>Hawaii residents pay the most for utilities.</p>
