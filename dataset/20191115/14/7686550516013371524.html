      <h1>Plasdwr answers questions on the traffic chaos coming into Cardiff from Radyr</h1>
      <h2>Work is taking place on one of Radyr's main roads ahead of a 7,000-home new development - and local residents are not happy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:33:58+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author">Cathy Owen</a></address>
      <p>Emergency meetings have been taking place after work on a large new development on the outskirts of Cardiff caused traffic chaos for commuters.</p>
      <p>Work is being carried out to widen Llantristant Road to create new bus and cycle lanes, to create a new four-way junction for Heol Isaf, and put in drainage infrastructure off the carriageway for the new £2.5bn <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/plasdwr">Plasdwr</a> development, which has been described as a 7,000-home 'garden city'.</p>
      <p>But motorists and local residents facing daily gridlocked traffic in and out of Radyr have been demanding something is done to stop the chaos that has seen 10 minute journeys take up an hour during peak times.</p>
      <p>They say that children are getting to school late, appointments are being missed and carers are not able to get to residents because of the delays.</p>
      <p>There have been queues in the morning and evening since work began in July, but it has been particularly bad in the past two weeks.</p>
      <p>In response to growing anger, the developers have said they have brought in changes to the traffic management system and brought on more workers to get the work done quicker.</p>
      <p>The developers say that work on the drainage system has meant a 24-hour lights system has had to be put in place to make it safe.</p>
      <p>But they have admitted that it was causing access issues and have now installed manually operated three-way lights at peak times.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>We asked Plasdwr a series of questions</h3>
      <p><b>How long are the roadworks going to take? Is the completion date for the whole scheme still August 2020?</b><br/><br/>The works around this section of Llantrisant Road are scheduled for completion in summer 2020, although they do not all involve working on the highway. We are currently going through the 2020 work schedule to minimise disruption for any work required in the carriageway. There are further works to be carried out along Llantrisant Road, including road widening for the new bus lane and cycle lane, and the construction of three new junctions, the next being between Clos Parc Radur and Goitre Fach. Moving forward we are planning to share more detail on these plans with the local community.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can we have the comprehensive breakdown on the work that still needs to be completed on the section of Llantrisant Road between the Heol Isaf roundabout and the Westward Ho petrol station?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our contractors are currently finalising highway drainage in the southern lane of the road. Once that is complete, next steps are to resurface the carriageway and install a pedestrian crossing. Then further utilities works, including existing gas main protection works and diversion of telecommunications, will be carried out further up the carriageway by the Heol Isaf roundabout. Once these are complete, the Heol Isaf roundabout will be removed and a four-way, signalised junction installed in its place.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why has the completion date of the latest section be put back by two weeks if the number of people working on it has doubled?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The current work we are doing is to make the drainage we’ve been installing operational, in order to minimise the risk of standing water on the road turning to ice when the weather becomes colder. This requires a 2.5-metre deep, 750mm-wide trench and the recent wet weather has also caused delays because of the bad underground conditions. So, Alun Griffiths Contractors doubled the number of workers to ensure completion as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why has it been so bad in the past two weeks?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The work outlined above required 24-hour lights to maintain safe routes for traffic and pedestrians. Previously we had automatic three-way lights in place, and removed them in response to complaints that queues were building up during peak times while people were waiting needlessly when the road was clear at off-peak times. So this time we didn’t reinstall three-way lights and there have been issues with traffic accessing Llantrisant Road from Heol Isaf during peak times. Since yesterday we have manually operated three-way lights at peak times: this worked well this morning and we will keep monitoring the traffic flow.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman said: "Previously we had automatic three-way lights in place, and removed them in response to complaints that queues were building up during peak times while people were waiting needlessly when the road was clear at off-peak times.</p>
      <p>"So this time we didn’t reinstall three-way lights and there have been issues with traffic accessing Llantrisant Road from Heol Isaf during peak times. Since Thursday we have manually operated three-way lights at peak times: this worked well on Friday morning and we will keep monitoring the traffic flow."</p>
      <p>The changes were brought in after a number of complaints from local residents and intervention from Cardiff council.</p>
      <p>Resident Tom Evans said that the traffic problems in the past two weeks have been a big concern, but the "bigger concern" is what is ahead.</p>
      <p>"This is only the formative stage of the development and we have already seen these problems," he said. "It is a real worry that the local authority seems to have a lack of control over the developer."</p>
      <p>Max, who is an engineer said: "Other big projects like the slip road at junction 33 and the Cogan Spur were delivered a lot quicker. It is incredibly frustrating. The initially said that this part of the project was going to take four weeks, but that then got extended to seven weeks even though they are bringing more people to work on it."</p>
      <p>Talking about the current work between the Heol Isaf roundabout and the Westward Ho petrol station, a spokeswoman for the developer said: "Our contractors are currently finalising highway drainage in the southern lane of the road.</p>
      <p>"Once that is complete, next steps are to resurface the carriageway and install a pedestrian crossing. Then further utilities works, including existing gas main protection works and diversion of telecommunications, will be carried out further up the carriageway by the Heol Isaf roundabout.</p>
      <p>"Once these are complete, the Heol Isaf roundabout will be removed and a four-way, signalised junction installed in its place."</p>

      <p>A council spokesman confirmed it had been holding meetings with the developers.</p>
      <p>He said: "Urgent meetings are being held to discuss how further on-site measures can be put in place to ease congestion and reduce the significant impact that residents and commuters are currently facing.</p>
      <p>"The contractor is introducing additional, manually-controlled traffic lights at peak times which will be responsive to traffic flow.</p>
      <p>"Assurances have been given that every possible option to reduce the disruption is being explored and that the work will be carried out as quickly as possible."</p>
      <p>The work began in July and is not planned to end until the end of August 2020, and three more junctions still need to be built before it is finished.</p>
      <p>When asked if last summer 2020 was still the completion date, a spokeswoman for the developers said: "The works around this section of Llantrisant Road are scheduled for completion in summer 2020, although they do not all involve working on the highway.</p>
      <p>"We are currently going through the 2020 work schedule to minimise disruption for any work required in the carriageway.

      </figure>
      <p>She added: "We understand the huge amount of frustration the works at the junction of Heol Isaf and Llantrisant Road have caused.</p>
      <p>"We have been working very closely with Cardiff council and our contractor, Alun Griffiths, to look at better and safer ways to control traffic at peak times."</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>How the new traffic management will work</h3>
      <p>Manually controlled traffic lights 20 to 30 metres will be set to the west of the roundabout at peak times.</p>
      <p>These will be responsive to traffic flow and ensure, for example, that traffic from Radyr can get onto Llantrisant Road more easily.</p>
      <p>When they are red, they will free up Heol Isaf traffic to move onto Llantrisant Road; when green, traffic from Heol Isaf will need to give way at the roundabout as normal, allowing traffic to clear from the west of the roundabout.</p>
      <p>The lights will be operated at peak times between 3.30pm and 7.00pm and 6.30am and 9.30am weekdays.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Work is also set to continue at the weekend on a dawn to dusk basis and they are going to monitor the traffic on Saturdays and Sundays to see if the manual traffic lights needed to be used then too.</p>
      <p>The new traffic light arrangement will be in place for the next three weeks, before traffic lights operating between 9.30am and 3.30pm will be in operation from December 9.</p>
      <p>Councillor Rod McKerlich, who represents Radyr and Morganstown, has said the roadworks have been causing "chaos" and he is being inundated with complaints.</p>
      <p>"I've lived in Radyr since 1974," he said. "The main road originally had lots of spare capacity. It now has 13,000 vehicles travelling along it every day.</p>
      <p>"It's creating chaos. Permission to operate temporary traffic lights is, rightly or wrongly, a matter where the local councillor has no formal voice. It is determined by a meeting of council officers, the contractor and the developer.</p>
      <p>"I suggested doing the work in school holidays and asked for consultation with nearby residents to see if 24 hour working could minimise the duration of the work."</p>

      <p>Kevin Brennan, the prospective parliamentary candidate for Cardiff West, has also written to Cardiff council calling for them to urgently look into the level of congestion.</p>
      <p>He said: "I call on the council to take firm steps to address the situation as soon as possible because of the level of disruption being caused."</p>
      <p>But not everyone is upset.</p>
      <p>One resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "I moved to Radyr from the Heath area in 2018 February and have seen the increasing traffic around the area since the new developments have started and roadworks/housebuilding has begun.</p>
      <p>"I've always had concerns about how that many new homes and eventually traffic would cope down Llantrisant road and into Cardiff, at the moment it's just roadworks but eventually with the many hundreds/thousands of homes that are being built it will only get worse.</p>
      <p>"But the utter NIMBYism of some of the residents astounds me. The people who have bought their homes for pennies many years ago are now essentially complaining that new homes are being built for young families, those same homes which were built in the 50s, 60s and 70s for them.</p>
      <p>"Yes the planning could be better, especially the road network and I do worry about the traffic in a few years but we will also have new schools, GP, dental surgery, shopping centre, green spaces. If that means I have to leave my house 10 minutes earlier in the mornings then so be it."</p>
