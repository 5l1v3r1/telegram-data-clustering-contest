      <h2>Tory success in this north-west seat could mean a big Commons majority for Boris Johnson.</h2>

      <p>Lancaster &amp; Fleetwood, which Jeremy Corbyn visited on Friday, is the sort of Labour-held seat that would be at risk in a Conservative landslide.</p>
      <p>It ranks at number 64 on a list of Labour constituencies most vulnerable to the Tories.</p>
      <p>Were it to change hands at the General Election on December 12, it would probably mean the Conservatives were on track for a comfortable majority in Parliament.</p>
      <p>The seat has only been in existence since 2010.</p>
      <p>It was held by the Conservatives until 2015, when it was narrowly won for Labour by Cat Smith.</p>

      <p>She also polled more than half of the vote (55%), with the Tories second (41%) and the Liberal Democrats far behind in third place (3%).</p>
      <p>Ms Smith is standing again in 2019, along with candidates for the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, the Brexit Party and the Greens.</p>
      <p>The Tories need a swing of 7.3% to take Lancaster &amp; Fleetwood – not an easy undertaking.</p>
      <p>But a swing of this size, if repeated across north-west England, could see up to 10 Labour seats falling to the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>The entire region will be crucial in determining the result of the election – which is why Boris Johnson was also campaigning in the area on Friday.</p>
