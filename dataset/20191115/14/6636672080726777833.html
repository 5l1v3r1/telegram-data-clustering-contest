        <b>Radar was, of course, one of the things which saved our neck in WWII.</b>
      </p>
      <p>No one, it seems, admired our expertise in radar more than Luftwaffe boss Hermann Goering.</p>
      <p>On October 8th 1943, he  stated:</p>
      <p>“In the field of radar they must have the world’s greatest genius. They have the geniuses and we have the nincompoops.  I hate the rogues like the plague, but in one respect I am obliged to doff my cap to them.”</p>
      <p>”After this war’s over I’m going to buy myself a British radio set, as a token of my regard for their high frequency work,” added Goering, “then at last I’ll have the luxury of owning something that has always worked.”</p>
