      <p>The Childline 1098 is observing ‘Childline Se Dosti’, a week-long national campaign, to join hands with citizens to improve the helpline services.</p>
      <p>In continuation with Children’s Day celebration, a sensitisation deliberation was initiated by the Tiruchi District Legal Services Authority and the District Child Protection Unit, along with Childline Services, here on Friday.</p>
      <p>The programme aimed at protecting and educating girl children was held at the District Session Court Campus.</p>
      <p>R..Nadhini, Secretary, DLSA, Tiruchi, briefed participants on the legal framework which girls should be aware of and the necessity for each child to become empowered in the life skills required.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship offers the training and employment opportunity which needs to be tapped appropriately and children should create themselves a safe environment around them.</p>
      <p>M. Geetha, District Child Protection Officer, in her address, underlined the need for society to protect girl children and ensure gender equality.</p>
      <p>Godwin Prem Singh, Nodal Director of Childline, said lack of rest rooms is a significant safety hazard for girls and gives them no other choice but to expose and relieve themselves in unsafe and public places.</p>
      <p>The Childline team works in collaboration with government shelter homes, child welfare committees, child protection officers, hospitals, police and other organizations to assist families and children to benefit from these schemes.</p>
      <p>Carter Premraj, Member, Child Welfare Committee highlighted the psycho-social background of a child which become more liable to become a juvenile delinquent irrespective of the parents’ upbringing and the environment. Advocates and Childline volunteers took part in the programme.</p>
