      <p>China Mobile: 5G phones cost less than 1,500 yuan ($214) by next year<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>The development of 5G is on a “speed-lane” and its services are reaching more people every day. However, one of the major concerns about 5G still remains the price of 5G devices. Today, at the 5G Pan-Intelligent Terminal Channel Eco-cooperation Summit held by China Mobile, the Chinese carrier released its 2020 5G terminal product plan. According to <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/china-mobile">China Mobile</a>, by next year, we should have over 100 5G phone models in the market. In addition, we should also have over 150 million units. However, the interesting part is that the carrier believes that the competition will drop the price of 5G phones to 1000 yuan ($143) – 1500 yuan ($214). </p>

      <p>If China Mobile’s forecast is anything to go by, that means we will have entry-level 5G phones by next year. At the conference, it released the “China Mobile 5G Commercial Mobile Phone Product White Paper” and “China Mobile 5G Commercial Pan Intelligent Terminal Product White Paper”. This clarifies that 5G terminal products will support the following from January 1, 2020</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NSA and SA dual mode</li>
        <li>2.6GHz, 3.5GHz, 4.9GHz frequency band</li>
        <li>enhance 5G terminal uplink and downlink capability</li>
        <li>better super uplink capability</li>
        <li>5G characteristic service portal on 5G mobile phone</li>
        <li>acceleration of the development of existing 5G applications</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recall that the likes of Xiaomi are already gearing up to launch cheap 5G smartphones next year. Some time ago, Xiaomi CEO, Lei Jun said that the company will release 10 5G phones next year. Today, he said that all Xiaomi phones in the first half of 2020 with a price tag above 2000 yuan ($285) will support 5G. This is consistent with the plan of China Mobile – to make 5G phones cheaper.</p>
