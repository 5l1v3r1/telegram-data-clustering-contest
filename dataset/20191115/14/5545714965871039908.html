      <p>If only shedding unwanted pounds were this easy in real life. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../red-dead-redemption-2-is-just-as-lovely-on-pc-571462.phtml"><i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>'s PC port</a> has a problem that's tied to uncapped framerates, and it's turning Arthur Morgan into a skinny, frail man.</p>
      <p>Players who have managed to avoid <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>'s technical issues when moving the framerate beyond 30fps have run into a less-conventional complication. They're noticing that it's impossible to keep Arthur well-fed. Additionally, the day/night cycles and inclement weather systems all seem to move too fast.</p>
      <p>Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRedDead/comments/dwjp1t/i_think_ive_just_made_a_discovery_about_a_big/">jimmyoneshot</a> appears to have figured out why the PC port seems off. The console versions run at a capped 30 frames per second, and it seems as though the game uses this as the measuring stick for calculating passage of time. When the framerate is set to 60fps, <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> thinks twice as much time has passed. It gets worse the higher you go.</p>
      <p>This isn't an unprecedented gaffe. <i>Dark Souls II</i> had a similar problem. Playing on PC at 60fps made weapons degrade twice as quickly because the game thought it had been played twice as long. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../dark-souls-ii-weapon-durability-fix-on-the-way-290628.phtml">Bandai Namco put out a patch</a> and everyone had a good laugh (unless you died a million times because your weapons kept breaking). </p>
      <p>So, <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> PC players are left with a real Sophie's choice: Turn down the frames and deal with progression as intended, or crank up the frames -- one of the main perks of the PC port, mind you -- and cope with a perpetually underfed protagonist. Rockstar will probably (hopefully) fix this sooner rather than later. For now, Arthur might be constantly malnourished and have trouble regenerating health, but at least he has a bangin' thigh gap.</p>
