      <p>If it were up to me, every Friday would be Free Theme Friday, a real and not at all made-up trend. Today's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0751-CUSA13594_00-TETRISEFFECTDYN2">free PS4 dynamic theme</a> hails from <i>Tetris Effect</i>, a lovely game that makes for a lovely theme.</p>
      <p>Courtesy of YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqzxfdznMqj7PgZsf3QaE4g">RenkaWong</a>, here's how the theme looks and (just as importantly) sounds.</p>

      <p>The Metamorphosis theme is a callback to one of the most touching moments in the game â€“ and no, if you haven't played <i>Tetris Effect</i> yet, that's not a joke. Mizuguchi knows how to cultivate emotion.</p>
      <p>Gosh I love this game.</p>
