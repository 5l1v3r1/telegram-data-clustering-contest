      <p>It was claimed the comedian was hopeful to have settled his divorce before he made his trip Down Under.</p>
      <p>At the crux of their complaint is Lisa's unwillingness to sign a non-disclosure agreement - as Ant is said to be desperate to avoid a public washing of his laundry in open court.</p>
      <p>Lisa, however, is relishing the opportunity to finish her marriage in the High Court, and is telling pals she will never sign the gagging order designed to protect Ant's reputation from further damage, according to The Sun</p>
