      <h1>Open Source game engine Xenko 3.1 ships</h1>

      <p>Former commercial 2D and 3D game engine gets its first update as an open-source app.</p>
      <p>Looking for an open-source alternative to Unity? (Or an alternative open-source alternative to <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>?) <a href="https://xenko.com/">Xenko</a> might be worth checking out. Originally developed by Japanese games and middleware firm Silicon Studio, the 2D and 3D game engine had a brief spell as a commercial product before going fully open-source last year, and this week's <a href="https://xenko.com/blog/release-xenko-3-1-0/">Xenko 3.1</a> is its first update under community development.</p>

        <i>It's a couple of years old now, but this trailer for Xenko's short-lived commercial launch gives you a fair idea of what the now-open-source 2D and 3D game engine is capable of.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>An open-source alternative to Unity?</h3>
      <p>Xenko has a <a href="https://xenko.com/features/">feature set</a> broadly similar to Unity or Godot, including a full asset pipeline; a 3D scene editor, 2D sprite editor and UI editor; character animation and pathfinding; and physics and particles.</p>
      <p>As you might expect, given that Silicon Studio develops <a href="https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/en/">optical effects middleware</a>, its graphics capabilities are pretty good, including support for PBR materials, hair and skin; a light probe system for indirect lighting; and a forward renderer with a standard set of post effects.</p>
      <p>Games can be deployed to Windows, Xbox One, Android and iOS – the latter two via Xamarin – and Linux. It also supports the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR headsets.</p>
      <p>However, Xenko’s unique selling point is that it is written fully in C#, rather than simply supporting C# for scripting, making it compatible with most .NET libraries.</p>
      <p>The 3.1 update also addresses one of its former drawbacks – that the file sizes of packaged games were quite high – by breaking Xenko up into a set of modular libraries. The editor itself is still a single application (although that may change in future updates), but when shipping a game, you can choose to include only those libraries you actually need. You can <a href="https://xenko.com/blog/release-xenko-3-1-0/">find out more in the dev team's blog post</a>.</p>
      <h3>System requirements</h3>
      <p>The Xenko 3.1 installer is available for Windows 7+. The source code is available under an <a href="https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/blob/master/LICENSE.md">MIT licence</a>.</p>
