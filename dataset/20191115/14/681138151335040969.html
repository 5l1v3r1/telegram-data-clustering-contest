      <p>Harry Fussey, 19, and Louis Cope-Cornell, 22, died on September 3, 2019, after a single-vehicle crash on the B1061, Dullingham Road.</p>
      <p>Suffolk's senior coroner Nigel Parsley opened and adjourned an inquest into their deaths at Suffolk Coroner's Court in Ipswich on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>Coroners' officer Julie Leacock told the inquest the car, which was being driven by Mr Fussey, appeared to be travelling towards Newmarket at the time of the collision.</p>
      <p>She said the vehicle, which police have since identified as a purple Volvo S40, came off the road close to a railway crossing.</p>
      <p>After leaving the road, the car crashed into a "substantial tree", coming to rest in a deep ditch.</p>
      <p>She said by the time the vehicle was discovered, the engine was cold, meaning the collision had taken place some time before.</p>
      <p>Mrs Leacock added that Mr Cope-Cornell was sitting in the from passenger seat at the time of the crash.</p>
      <p>Police had been called to the scene at around 2.50am on the morning of the tragedy.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service and the East of England Ambulance Service also attended the scene, but the two men were found dead inside the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Mr Parsley said an independent case review is set to take place on December 4 with the date of the full inquest set for March 10 next year.</p>
      <p>Tributes flooded social media following the death of the two men.</p>
      <p>Louise Morgan, Dullingham Parish Council Clerk, said: "I knew the families on a personal level.</p>
      <p>"It is very tragic that it happened.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what caused the crash or what happened but it is a very sad loss.</p>
      <p>"It is a really tragic loss for the community. My thoughts go out to their families."</p>
      <p>West Suffolk district councillor for Newmarket East, Robert Nobbs, added: "It is just an extremely sad event to have happened.</p>
      <p>"I was aware that there had been two fatalities on the road and I think that there is great shock amongst everybody locally.</p>
      <p>"I know that there have been accidents before on that bit of road, but I don't really travel along it enough to know how it happened."</p>
