      <p>A statement from her agents, Scott Marshall Partners, said: “It is with great sadness that we announce the death of actress Jean Fergusson, known to millions as flirtatious Marina in the long running BBC comedy Last Of The Summer Wine.</p>
      <p>“Jean was a much-loved and respected actress, a brilliant comedienne, raconteur, and the life and soul of any gathering. She will be much missed by her many friends and colleagues.</p>
      <p>“Jean passed away, at home, in the early hours of Thursday November 14.</p>
      <p>“She is survived by her beloved sister Marjorie, brother-in-law Roger and her nephews Daniel and William.”</p>

      <p>She wrote: “Shocked &amp; saddened to hear Jean Fergusson has passed Lovely lady, fabulous actress. Saw her Sunday at #SuPollard’s birthday, said she wasn’t feeling well. @benstockbiz and I planned to take her out next week.</p>
      <p>“Can’t believe she’s gone #LastoftheSummerWine #SheKnowsYouKnow #Corrie.”</p>
      <p>Fergusson’s death comes just over a month after the death of her Last Of The Summer Wine co-star Juliette Kaplan, who played battleaxe Pearl Sibshaw.</p>
      <p>Kaplan was 80 when she died from cancer in October.</p>
      <p>Wakefield-born actress Fergusson was familiar in households across the UK for her role as the opinionated and attractive Marina in the popular BBC comedy series, which ran from 1973 until 2010 and was set in the Yorkshire Dales.</p>
      <p>She joined the sitcom in 1985 as the peroxide blonde love interest of Howard Sibshaw (Robert Fyfe), the pair conducting their affair behind his wife Pearl’s back.</p>
