      <p>The original <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/lexus/">Lexus</a> LS400 was the automotive equivalent of a batter approaching the plate, pointing to the right-field bleachers and smacking the first pitch out of the ballpark. With the engineering excellence of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/">Toyota</a> fueled by the bountiful resources of the Japanese bubble economy, the first LS perfectly executed its mission. It also set a benchmark in quality and has earned a stellar reputation for durability. Most of the examples that today turn up in the used-car market have racked up mileage well into the six figures, and although they're often amazingly well preserved, that very longevity makes the idea of a near-new first-gen LS400 all the more compelling. With just 34k miles on the clock, this 1993 LS400 <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1993-lexus-ls-5/">available now on Bring a Trailer</a> is the freshest we've seen in a long time.</p>
      <p>This LS400 is said to have remained with its original owner until being acquired by a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/car-dealers/">dealer</a> in New Jersey. Like seemingly all LS400s of its era, the car is champagne gold with a tan leather interior. It also has chrome wheels and gold badging â€” but then we did say it was a New Jersey car.</p>
      <p>A just-completed $1,200 service included a new timing belt, water pump, and distributor caps and rotors (there are two, one per cylinder bank). That should start the winning bidder off on a course of several hundred thousand miles of trouble-free ownership. At this writing, bidding has already reached $10,000, with six days to go.</p>
