      <h1>More buggies, minibuses proposed in Hampi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:31:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sathish-G-T-1357/" target="_blank">Sathish G.T.</a></address>
      <p>The Hampi World Heritage Area Management Authority has decided to procure 10 more battery-operated buggies for tourists visiting the famed Vittala temple complex in Hampi. It also plans to introduce minibuses to ferry visitors to different monuments in Hampi.</p>
      <p>At present, six buggies ferry visitors for about one kilometre from Gajjala Mantap to Vijaya Vittata temple. Of the 25 buggies procured over the last 10 years, only six are operational, which is woefully inadequate given the tourist flow.</p>
      <p>P.N. Lokesh, Commissioner of the authority, said, “The new buggies will be in place before Hampi Utsav scheduled in January 2020.” As many as 13 women employed by the authority operate the buggies in two shifts. Each woman operates 20 rounds a day between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the minibuses, he said, “We want to introduce a system of a daily pass for travel in Hampi throughout the day. Three vehicles will be doing the rounds on a specific route covering a few monuments.”</p>
      <p>The local people also feel the need for more measures to facilitate tourists. “Hampi is a vast area, with around 1,600 monuments. It would be difficult to cover the entire area without proper transportation,” said Basava, a resident of Hampi, who works as a guide for visitors.</p>
      <p>The authority has also decided to study the feasibility of aqua sports at tanks located in Kamalapura, on the Hampi University campus and Sanapura. The commissioner said there was a proposal to introduce trekking, rock-climbing, mountain-biking, and heritage walks.</p>
