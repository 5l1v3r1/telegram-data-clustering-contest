      <p>Germany has forced Apple to open its NFC capabilities on iPhones so that third-party payment apps can compete better with Apple Pay (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-germany-apple-pay/apple-warns-of-risks-from-german-law-to-open-up-mobile-payments-idUSKBN1XP16M">via</a> <i>Reuters</i>).</p>
      <h3>German Payment Apps</h3>
      <p>In a late night parliamentary session on Wednesday the country forced Apple to open up NFC to third-party payment apps. This was an amendment to an anti-money laundering law passed on Thursday. It will come into effect early next year.</p>
      <p>The law didn’t specifically mention Apple, only “operators of electronic money infrastructure.” Apple Pay is a growing business for the company, recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/23/apple-pay-overtakes-starbucks-in-us/">beating Starbucks</a> to become the most popular mobile payment solution. Today Apple said in a statement:</p>
      <blockquote>We are surprised at how suddenly this legislation was introduced. We fear that the draft law could be harmful to user friendliness, data protection and the security of financial information.</blockquote>
