      <h1>Line, Yahoo Japan in merger talks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:47:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Jong-hwa, UPI News Korea</a></address>
      <p>SEOUL, Nov. 15 (UPI) -- Messaging app Line is in talks to merge with Yahoo Japan, the two companies said.</p>
      <p>Line is held by Korea's Internet giant Naver, while Yahoo Japan is owned by Japanese telecom firm SoftBank.</p>
      <p>Both companies acknowledged that discussions were underway for the prospective union, which would be valued around $27 billion. But they said nothing had been decided.</p>
      <p>SoftBank controls Z Holdings, which is valued about $17 billion and owns Yahoo Japan, while Line has a stock market value of about $10 billion.</p>
      <p>SoftBank and Naver are reportedly mulling over forming a 50-50 venture that would control Z Holdings, which would in turn run Line and Yahoo Japan.</p>
      <p>The union would bring about a mega-size online payment platform with more than 100 million users to challenge competitors like <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Amazoncom/?tps=1">Amazon</a>, Tencent and Rakuten.</p>
      <p>Line runs one of the most popular messaging apps in Japan, with more than 80 million users. It also operates other services, including Line Pay and Line Tax.</p>
      <p>With more than 50 million users, Yahoo Japan is a dominant web portal in the world's third-largest economy.</p>
      <p>Investors positively regarded the merger talks as shares in Z Holdings soared 17 percent on Thursday, while those of Line also jumped 15 percent. In comparison, Rakuten lost 6 percent.</p>
      <p>The upcoming deal is seen as the latest maneuver of SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son, who has worked to make inroads into online retail and payment services.</p>
      <p>The news also came at a time when SoftBank Group netted a loss of $65 billion during the July-September period, its first quarterly deficit in 14 years.</p>
      <p>Naver was founded by Lee Hae-jin, who still exerts great influence on the search engine even after he stepped down from the company's board in early 2018.</p>
      <p>Son is a Korean-Japanese businessman who created SoftBank in 1981.</p>
