      <p>Fortnite players have a new skin available, and it ties into Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.</p>
      <p>A new skin modeled after the Imperial Stormtrooper is now available for <b>Fortnite</b>.</p>
      <p>It looks rather cool. I mean, who wouldn’t want to dress up like a Stormtrooper? Sure they are fodder for Jedi, but they are iconic and look super cool.</p>
      <p>If you want the skin for Fortnite, there are <b>two ways</b> to obtain it.</p>
      <p>You can purchase it directly from the item shop for <b>1,500 V-Bucks</b>, or you can <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/home">buy Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order from the Epic Games Store</a>.</p>
      <p>The skin offer with the game is available until November 30, so if you were planning on buying Jedi: Fallen Order anyway, do so by that date.</p>
      <p>Respawn Entertainment’s title released today, and you can <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-scores-round-up/">look over the review scores in our round-up</a>.</p>
