      <p>Warner Bros. and director <b>James Wan</b> are currently in the process of developing <b><i>Aquaman 2</i></b> and in case you’ve been wondering, Ocean Master will return for the sequel. The news was shared by Patrick Wilson during an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/midway-star-patrick-wilson-his-aquaman-2-future-1254563">THR, </a>saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m slightly briefed [on Orm-related matters]. I just throw a little dart here and there. I’ll say, ‘So, what about this?’ and [James Wan will] say, ‘Well, this is what I’m thinking.'”</blockquote>
      <p>He goes on to tease Wan’s vision for the sequel, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“I can tell you that even his concepts for Aquaman 2 are pushing it even further. I have a few ideas of where Orm fits in, but I’m not gonna talk about them.”</blockquote>
      <p>When previously talking about the film, <b>Jason Momoa</b> said that it’s going to be “way bigger” than the first one:</p>
      <blockquote>“There’s a lot more in store on so many more levels. There’s going to be a lot. It’s way bigger!”</blockquote>
      <p>He went on to add that he had some ideas and input about where the story should lead that he pitched to the studio, and they were excited about them:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m really stoked at the fan base and what we did with the movie and just went into Warner Bros in D.C. and said, ‘You know, I have some ideas. And, they love them and James [Wan, director] and everyone is like, ‘We’re all taking it in. We’re excited to do another one.’”</blockquote>
      <p>I really enjoyed the first Aquaman film and it’ll be interesting to see where they take the story with the upcoming sequel. <i>Aquaman 2 </i> is scheduled to hit theaters on December 16th, 2022.</p>
