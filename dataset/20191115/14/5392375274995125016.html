      <p>Lu Weibing: Redmi K30 series will be released in 2020<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>This afternoon, Xiaomi Group Vice President and Redmi Brand General Manager, Lu Weibing, announced on Weibo that the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/redmi-k30">Redmi K30</a> 5G smartphone will be the company’s pioneer device next year. His words “In 2020, Redmi is a 5G pioneer. See you at K30!”. This debunks earlier speculations that the Redmi K30 may arrive later this year. MediaTek will probably announce its new 5G chip in a press conference on November 26. There are speculations that the first model to use this chip is the Redmi K30.</p>

      <p>Lu Weibing said that Redmi will continue to adhere to high quality in the era of 5G. It has overcome a series of technical difficulties that were associated with the early stages of 5G development. Thus it is now in the position to bring the best quality 5G terminal to Redmi followers.</p>
      <p>At the Redmi 8 series launch conference, Lu Weibing said that Redmi K30 supports SA/NSA dual-mode 5G. This is the first Redmi (Xiaomi at large) phone to support dual-mode 5G. This smartphone will also be the first Redmi/Xiaomi device to come with a dual punch hold camera design. As early as September this year, Lu Weibing confirmed the existence of Redmi K30 5G. However, we now know that we will have to wait until 2020 for this device.</p>
