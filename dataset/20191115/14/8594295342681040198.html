      <p>Despite what the media tells us, kids have a lot of dumb ideas. That said, plenty of youngins possess a wit and canniness that defies their years, sometimes — perhaps even often — making them better company than obnoxious know-it-alls in their 20s.</p>
      <p>I used to babysit a coworker’s son by taking him to the bar, so these sentiments come from experience.</p>
      <p>Thinking back to one’s own childhood, it’s often embarrassing to recall the things we believed at the time; things that the march of time revealed to be untrue. In regard to the automotive realm, what beliefs did a younger you hold as an unshakable truth?</p>
      <p>This writer’s elementary school years saw a Ferrari Testarossa and Ford Mustang GT adorn the walls of his bedroom; in the corner sat a pile of <i>Collectible Automobile</i> magazines dating back to the first issue. It was at a very young age that I fell in love with overstuffed land yachts…</p>
      <p>But it was because of this fixation on old cars that, at a single-digit age, I was more concerned with domestic features that had already fallen by the wayside a decade-plus earlier than anything new coming out of Japan. Like, for example, the one feature that always sends a thrill up my leg: Hardtops. Pillarless hardtops.</p>
      <p>Early on, however, I had somehow come to believe that the definition of a hardtop had to do with the distance from the A-pillar to the B-pillar in relation to the distance from the B-pillar to the C-pillar, at least when viewing the car with windows up. Some pillarless coupes and sedans looked fairly pillar-ly with glass up. Obviously, this was dumb. Pillarless means no B-pillar. Simple as that, but it took awhile for the confusion to end.</p>
      <p>I also believed at the time that personal luxury coupes with canvas faux-cabriolet roofs — not just your run-of-the-mill vinyl landau-style roof — were <i>actual convertibles</i>. These tops were most commonly seen on the Lincoln Continental Mk. VI and Chrysler Cordoba. Good job, Detroit — you fooled a kid. I eventually learned why no owner seemed to want the wind in what was left of their hair.</p>
      <p>In hindsight, it’s amusing to think of the things we once believed. What were you once convinced of?</p>
