      <p><b>MOSCOW – </b>Shoma Uno was fourth at the Cup of Russia after the men’s short program on Friday.</p>
      <p>Uno, looking for his third victory in a Grand Prix series event after winning both Skate Canada and the NHK Trophy last year, scored 87.29 points, just 0.25 shy of Makar Ignatov’s third-place score of 87.54.</p>
      <p>Alexander Samrin led the 12-man field with 92.81, followed by Dmitri Aliev. Kazuki Tomono was seventh.</p>
      <p>Uno, the Pyeongchang Olympic silver medalist, opened his program by falling on the landing of his first quad flip.</p>
      <p>He recovered, however, following up by landing a quad toe loop-double toe loop combination and nailing a triple axel in the latter portion of his program.</p>
      <p>“The big issue for me this time was whether or not I could execute my jumps other than the flip,” Uno said. “So I’m extremely relieved.”</p>
