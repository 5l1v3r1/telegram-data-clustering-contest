      <h2>President Donald Trump released the transcript of his first call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday just as the second round of public hearings began.</h2>

      <p>The contents of the call were not controversial, as Trump congratulated Zelensky for his victory and they both discussed visits to each other’s country.</p>
      <p>Trump commented that when he owned the Miss Universe beauty pageant “they always had great people” and that Ukraine was “always well represented.”</p>
      <p>Zelensky said that he would practice his English so they could speak together in the same language.</p>
      <p>“That’s beautiful to hear,” Trump said. “That’s really good. I could not do that in your language.”</p>
