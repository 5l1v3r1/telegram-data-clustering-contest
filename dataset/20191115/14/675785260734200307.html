      <h1>General election: Tough crowd for Jeremy Corbyn as he meets hilariously grumpy baby</h1>
      <h2>While fans of Jeremy Corbyn were delighted to meet him after his speech in Lancaster today, one little baby seemed less than impressed to meet the Labour leader</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:38:15+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:38</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine McCahill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/elaine-mccahill/</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn had a tough crowd in Lancaster this afternoon when one little <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> fan was less than impressed to meet him.</p>
      <p>While many Labour supports were only delighted to meet Mr Corbyn after his speech, this little one wasn't having any of it.</p>
      <p>A series of hilarious photos show the the baby pulling a face as the Labour leader leans in to say hello.</p>
      <p>The baby's mum happily posed for pictures with Corbyn but her mini-me continued to make a series of hilariously grumpy faces.</p>
      <p>While the baby might not have been impressed with Corbyn, the Labour leader was met with cheers when he announced the party's plans to nationalise high-speed broadband.</p>

      <p>Announcing his policy, the Labour leader said providing fast-speed internet to all parts of the UK is “too important to be left to the corporations”.</p>
      <p>Adding broadband to Labour's pledges to nationalise rail, energy and water, he said: “What was once a luxury is now a utility”.</p>
      <p>He promised the plan would “fire up” the economy, improve productivity and “bring half a million people back into the workforce.”</p>
      <p>The Labour leader said it would reduce carbon emissions because it would reduce the need for commuting and end “patchy and slow coverage once and for all.”</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn said nationalised broadband would save the average household £30 a month.</p>
      <p>He also vowed to close the "tax tricks" used by giant corporations to partially fund free full-fibre internet to all.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said the Conservatives’ policy is “a low-budget option using old copper cables that are already out of date”.</p>
      <p>He added: “Johnson’s plans are yet another billionaire wealth grab, bringing public money to big corporations including Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin instead of putting the technology in the hands of the people of this country.”</p>

      <p>On how the scheme will be funded, Mr Corbyn said: “The initial upgrade to our infrastructure will be funded through our Green Transformation Fund. “When it comes to the running costs, we’re not going to put that onto the British public, who have already forked out far too much for rip-off broadband.</p>
      <p>“Instead, a Labour government will close down tax tricks used by giants like <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> , who make millions in this country while paying next to nothing to the public services which they benefit from.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “British Broadband will be our treasured public institution for the 21st century, delivering fast and free broadband to every single home. “Together we will build a new public service delivering the fastest broadband free to everyone.”</p>
