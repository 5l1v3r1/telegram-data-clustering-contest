      <p>With production on “Impeachment: American Crime Story” set to begin in early 2020, FX has cast the role of U.S. President Bill Clinton.</p>
      <p>The hugely anticipated third season of “American Crime Story” is in the works and will focus on the sex scandal that engulfed Clinton when his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky led to his impeachment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/clive-owen-cast-bill-clinton-impeachment-american-crime-story-fx-sarah-paulson-monica-lewinsky-1202787207/"><i>Deadline</i></a> is reporting that the Ryan Murphy-produced limited series is firming up its casting and has secured actor Clive Owen to play America’s 42nd president.</p>
      <p>Owen will join a cast that already includes Beanie Feldstein as Lewinsky, Sarah Paulson as Linda Tripp and Annaleigh Ashford as Paula Jones. The actual Monica Lewinsky is on board as a producer, with the role of Hillary Clinton yet to be cast.</p>

      <p>“Impeachment: American Crime Story” is based on Jeffrey Toobin’s bestseller <i>A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President</i>, marking the second time that “American Crime Story” has used one of his books as source material; Toobin’s 1997 book<i> The Run of His Life: The People v. O. J. Simpson</i> was the basis for the series’ critically acclaimed first season.</p>
      <p>“This ‘American Crime Story’ season focuses on the events that led up to and through the Ken Starr special counsel investigation that resulted in President Bill Clinton’s impeachment votes in the House and Senate, as told through the point of view of the many women who were swept up the maelstrom,” explained FX chairman John Landgraf at the summer edition of the Television Critics Association press tour.</p>
      <p>Landgraf also responded to concerns about the timing of the season, which is set to air in fall 2020, just prior to what may be the most contentious presidential election in American history.</p>

      <p>“I think the way we look at ‘American Crime Story’ is as revisionist history,” said Landgraf. “We look at moments in time that involve crimes, that can be looked at with much more nuance and much more complexity in the fullness of time through great writing and character looking back than they could be at the time. And I feel completely unabashed about my pride for ‘American Crime Story’ and my belief that this is a completely valid cycle of ‘American Crime Story’. It’s an excellent story, and the writing is superb and the cast is superb. And there’s just a lot of nuance in the story that people don’t know.”</p>
      <p>Owen can also be seen in <a href="https://etcanada.com/video/facd10b2-05c9-11ea-b4b4-568268c18cb3/jonah-hauer-king-at-tiff-2019/">Francois Girard’s historical drama “The Song Of Names”</a> when it hits movie theatres on Dec. 25.</p>
