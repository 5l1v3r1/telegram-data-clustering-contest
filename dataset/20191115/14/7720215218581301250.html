      <p>During the recent decline, the price traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last major upward move from the $7,350 low to $10,488 high.</p>
      <p>It opened the doors for more downsides and the price is now trading below the $8,700 level. On the downside, there is a strong support waiting near the $8,540 and $8,520 levels.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there is a major breakout pattern forming with resistance near the $8,760 level on the same chart. If there is an upside break above the triangle resistance, the price could recover towards the $9,000 resistance area.</p>
      <p>On the downside, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last major upward move from the $7,350 low to $10,488 high is also a strong support. If there is a bearish break below the $8,500 support, bitcoin price is likely to continue lower.</p>
      <p>The next key support is near the $8,340 level. Any further losses is likely to push the price towards the $8,000 and $7,900 support levels. An intermediate support is near $8,090, which coincides with the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last major upward move from the $7,350 low to $10,488 high.</p>
      <p>Overall, bitcoin price seems to be approaching the next key break either above the $9,000 resistance or towards the $8,000 support area.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Ethereum price retested the $190.00 and $192.00 resistance levels on a couple of occasions. However, ETH/USD failed to gain momentum above the $192.00 area and it is currently declining.</p>

      <p>Ethereum Price Chart: Click to Enlarge</p>
      <p>Looking at the 4-hours <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, the price broke a couple of key supports near the $190.00 and $188.00 support levels. Moreover, there was a close below the $185.40 support and the 21 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a break below a contracting triangle with support near the $184.10 level on the same chart. The price traded as low as $180.73 and it is currently consolidating losses.</p>
      <p>An immediate resistance is near the $182.90 level. It coincides with the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $190.06 high to $180.73 low. However, the main resistance is near the $185.40 level.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $190.06 high to $180.73 low is also near the $185.40 area. Therefore, a successful close above the $185.40 and $186.00 levels is needed for more gains.</p>
      <p>The next key resistance area is near the $190.00 and $192.00 levels. On the downside, an initial support is near the $180.00 level, below which Ethereum is likely to continue lower towards the $177.80 support area.</p>
      <p>The next major support area is near the $170.40 level, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline towards the $155.00 level in the coming days.</p>
      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Ripple price underperformed both Ethereum and bitcoin this week against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair declined steadily and broke many supports near the $0.2880 and $0.2750 levels.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://blockonomi-9fcd.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ripple-price-XRP-chart-2.png"/>

      <p>Ripple Price Chart: Click to Enlarge</p>
      <p>Looking at the 4-hours <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/">chart</a>, the price even settled below the key $0.2750 support area and the 21 simple moving average (4-hours). Finally, there was a break below the $0.2720 support area.</p>
      <p>A new monthly low was formed near $0.2625 and the price remains at a risk of more downsides. An initial resistance is near the $0.2675 level, plus the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2847 high to $0.2625 low.</p>
      <p>The main resistance is near the $0.2700 level and the 21 simple moving average (4-hours). Moreover, there is a declining channel forming with resistance near the $0.2710 level.</p>
      <p>Above the channel resistance, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2847 high to $0.2625 low is near the $0.2735 level.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a clear break above the $0.2700 and $0.2740 levels is needed for a decent recovery. In the mentioned case, the price is likely to continue higher towards the $0.2850 and $0.2880 resistance levels.</p>
      <p>Conversely, ripple price may perhaps continue to decline below $0.2600. An initial support is near the $0.2575 level, below which it could decline further towards the $0.2510 and $0.2500 support levels.</p>
      <h3>Litecoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Litecoin price struggled to gain momentum above the $64.00 and $65.00 resistance levels against the US Dollar. As a result, the LTC/USD pair started a fresh decline and broke the $62.00 support area.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://blockonomi-9fcd.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Litecoin-price-LTC-chart.png"/>

      <p>Looking at the 4-hours <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/">chart</a>, the price even broke the $61.00 support area and the 21 simple moving average (4-hours). The decline was such that the price even broke a connecting bullish trend line with support near the $60.80 level.</p>
      <p>It is now trading near the last swing low at $58.80 level, with a bearish angle. An initial support is near the $57.10 level. It coincides with the 1.236 Fib extension level of the upward move from the $58.83 low to $66.76 high.</p>
      <p>Any further losses may perhaps call for a push towards the $55.00 area. The next key support is near the $54.00 level since it is near the 1.618 Fib extension level of the upward move from the $58.83 low to $66.76 high.</p>
      <p>On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $59.90 and $60.00 levels. However, the main resistance is near the $61.00 level and the 21 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
      <p>Therefore, a clear break above the $61.00 resistance may perhaps push litecoin price towards the main $64.00 and $65.00 resistance levels.</p>
      <h3>Top Gainers</h3>
      <p>During the past 7 days, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and climbed more than 100%, including DUO, SNTR, PAC, ADT, OPNN, CATT, BTB and CTXC (trading volume more than $50K). Out of these, DUO rallied around 375% and SNTR gained nearly 300%.</p>
      <p>Overall, bitcoin price is struggling to hold a couple of key supports and it could even spike below the $8,540 support area. However, once the current wave is complete, there could be a fresh increase or recovery in BTC and major altcoins such as Ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, XLM, ADA, TRX, EOS, ICX, BNB, XMR, NEO, and WTC in the coming days.</p>
