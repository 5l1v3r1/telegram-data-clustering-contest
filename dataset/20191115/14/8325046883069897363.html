        <li>Celebrities have come to <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift’s</a> defense after the singer <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-accused-scott-borchetta-scooter-braun-block-songs-amas-2019-11">accused Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta</a>, who founded her former label Big Machine Records, of impeding her upcoming performance at the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/amas">American Music Awards.</a></li>
        <li>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867">lengthy statement tweeted on Thursday</a>, Swift asked fans “to talk some sense into the men who are exercising control” over her after she was told she couldn’t perform her old music at the AMAs.</li>
        <li>Artists like <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/halsey">Halsey,</a> <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/lily-allen">Lily Allen,</a> Tinashe, Selena Gomez and Jordan Pruitt all showed “solidarity” with Swift. Other celebrity friends including <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/gigi-hadid">Gigi Hadid</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/ruby-rose">Ruby Rose</a> also tweeted their support.</li>
        <li>“These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear,” she said. “Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she’s overreacting. You’re barking up the wrong tree,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iamhalsey/?hl=en">Halsey posted on her Instagram story.</a></li>

      <p>Celebrities are supporting <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> after she said record label owners <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/scooter-braun">Scooter Braun</a> and Scott Borchetta were impeding her upcoming performance at the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/amas">American Music Awards.</a></p>
      <p>Swift made a direct plea to fans via <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/taylorswift/?hl=en">Instagram</a> on Thursday night asking them “to talk some sense into the men who are exercising tyrannical control” over her.</p>

      <p>The singer wrote that the pair were blocking her from playing her old music for her Artist of the Decade performance at the upcoming AMAs.</p>
      <p>“The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you’ll be punished,” Swift tweeted.</p>

      <p>Since posting her statement, #IStandWithTaylor is trending on Twitter and a fan-made <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/music/news/istandwithtaylor-ed-sheeran-halsey-camila-cabello-and-other-stars-come-out-in-support-of-taylor-swift-in-scooter-braun-controversy/articleshow/72065779.cms">Change.org petition</a> has racked up more than 68,000 signatures of support at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>“My heart is so heavy right now,” Selena Gomez wrote in <a href="https://twitter.com/mainpopgirI/status/1195292123911770114/photo/1">a lengthy Instagram story on Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>“… You’ve robbed and crushed one of our best song writers of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with fans and the world.”</p>
      <p>An incensed <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/halsey">Halsey</a> clapped back at the label for “punishing” Swift, also <a href="https://twitter.com/mainpopgirI/status/1195175520167530496?s=20">writing on Instagram</a> about the lack of autonomy artists have over their work.</p>
      <p>“These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear,” she said. “Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she’s overreacting. You’re barking up the wrong tree.”</p>
      <p>The “Without Me” singer also shared a video of her belting out Swift’s 2010 single, “Mean,” which was <a href="https://www.popsugar.co.uk/entertainment/halsey-singing-mean-by-taylor-swift-video-46903921?utm_medium=redirect&amp;amp;utm_campaign=US:GB&amp;amp;utm_source=www.google.com">reportedly inspired by a feud she had with a music critic.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/gigi-hadid">Gigi Hadid</a> who featured in Swift’s, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo">“Bad Blood”</a> music video in 2015 wrote: “Scott and Scooter, you know what the right thing to do is. Taylor and her fans deserve to celebrate the music!!”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/lily-allen">Lily Allen,</a> who wrote about her personal battles against the record industry in her 2019 autobiography, “My Thoughts Exactly,” also shared solidarity for Swift through a number of tweets, drawing from her own experience.</p>
      <p>“Solidarity with Taylor here, this sounds awful, and people wonder why music hasn’t had its #MeToo moment?”</p>

      <p>Country singer <a href="https://twitter.com/JordansBlog">Jordan Pruitt</a> also gave her take on the dispute as she questioned whether Braun and Borchetta’s business tactics could be a form of harassment.</p>
      <p>“The things that @scottborchetta + Scooter Braun are continuing to do to @taylorswift13 are not only wrong, they should be illegal!’ she wrote. ‘You ‘men’ should focus your sights on things other than bullying the Artist of this CENTURY. LEAVE TAYLOR ALONE. PERIODT.”</p>

      <p>Singer <a href="https://twitter.com/Tinashe/status/1195129084185063426?s=20">Tinashe tweeted</a>: “Fuck that. We’re here with you … It genuinely makes me sick to my stomach,” and Swift’s long-time friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rubyrose/?hl=en">Ruby Rose wrote in an Instagram story:</a> “This is not ok.”</p>

      <p>Fans have also since implored Swift’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuXNumBwDOM">“ME!”</a> duet partner and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/panic-at-the-disco">Panic! at the Disco</a> frontman <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/brendon-urie">Brendon Urie</a> to weigh in on the issue, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwtLWvUhA7o/">commenting on his Instagram post</a> of the pair from 29 weeks ago.</p>
      <p>One fan wrote: “Brendon, please voice your support for Taylor. It will help the cause a lot and means a lot to Swifties,” while another said: “We know you were the only male artist to support her during scooter and scott situation last time, and I do hope you do so this time as well!”</p>
      <p>During a live stream on July 1, <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-big-machine-records-feud-celebrity-reactions-2019-7">Urie ranted about Braun, calling him a “piece of shit,”</a> and referring to the “toxic dudes doing toxic bullshit in this toxic industry,” following the announcement of <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-accused-scott-borchetta-scooter-braun-block-songs-amas-2019-11">Braun’s controversial acquisition of Swift’s former record label, Big Machine Records.</a></p>
      <p>Fans also reached out to Swift’s friend and collaborator <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3bbKnPhkcA/">Ed Sheeran</a> with one fan asking him on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3bbKnPhkcA/">Instagram</a>: “Hey Ed, can you reach out to @scooterbraun in support of @taylorswift ?”</p>
      <p>Fans lashed out at Sheeran back in July for keeping quiet about the ordeal when it unfolded. He later responded to a comment and implied he had been consoling the singer: “I have been speaking directly to her, like I always do.”</p>
