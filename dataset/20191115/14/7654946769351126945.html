      <h1>Browns-Steelers fantasy football takeaways: JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Conner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:46:11+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author">Samantha Previte</a></address>
      <p>The Cleveland Browns picked up a much-needed win on Thursday night against AFC North rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was a wild game riddled with ejections and injuries to key players, such as JuJu Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson, and James Conner. A four-interception game by Rudolph proved costly in the 21-7 loss. The Browns improved to 4-6 and the Steelers fall to 5-5.</p>
      <p>Here are six things you need to know for fantasy football:</p>
      <h3>1. JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson concussed in brutal helmet-to-helmet hits</h3>
      <p>Smith-Schuster exited the game in the second quarter after suffering a brutal helmet-to-helmet hits from cornerback Greedy Williams and safety Morgan Burnett. It was a frightening scene as he laid on the ground motionless afterwards, but was able to walk off the field on his own.</p>
      <p>Halfway through the third quarter, Johnson also took a helmet-to-helmet hit in the second half from safety Damarious Randall that left him on the ground and bleeding from his right ear. He was eventually able to walk off the field with significant help from the training staff. Randall was ejected for the illegal hit.</p>
      <p>Both Steelers receivers were ruled out for return and were placed in the concussion protocol. Smith-Schuster finished the night with two catches on four targets for 21 yards. His season has been disappointing for fantasy, but he’s still been a week-to-week WR2. Johnson also had two catches on four targets for 17 yards. He has been vying with James Washington for the No. 2 role for the Steelers. It’s likely that both miss time, which leaves the team very lean at receiver. Washington, Johnny Holton and Tevin Jones, who was just promoted from the practice squad prior to the game, are the only available receivers.</p>

      <h3>2. James Conner leaves game with shoulder injury</h3>
      <p>Conner re-aggravated a lingering shoulder injury during the first half of Thursday’s game. He went to the locker room and did not return. After missing Weeks 9 and 10, Conner was clearly not at full strength. He finished the evening with five carries for 10 yards.</p>
      <p>This elevates Jaylen Samuels’ and Trey Edmunds’ values, as the Steelers will likely lean on the two if their star running back were to miss more time. They have a great Week 12 matchup against the Bengals.</p>
      <h3>3. Mason Rudolph tosses four picks</h3>
      <p>Rudolph was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/">hit on the head with his own helmet</a> by defensive end Myles Garrett, instigating a brawl with eight seconds remaining in the game. It was an egregious action by the Browns defensive end, especially in light of the nasty concussion the Steelers quarterback suffered in Week 5 against the Ravens.</p>
      <p>The controversy masked a terrible performance by Rudolph. He completed 23 passes on a season-high 44 attempts for 221 yards, one touchdown and four interceptions, matching his season total up to this point. His ineptitude hurts all members of the Pittsburgh offense.</p>
      <h3>4. Baker Mayfield has another clean game</h3>
      <p>After seven straight games with at least one interception, Mayfield may have turned things around. This was his third game in a row without throwing a pick.He completed 17 of 32 passes for 193 yards, two passing touchdowns and a vultured rushing touchdown from the 1-yard line. Perhaps even more impressively, he was only sacked once. He should be a good streamer in Week 12 against the Dolphins.</p>
      <h3>5. Jarvis Landry overshadows Odell Beckham once again</h3>
      <p>Landry picked up another touchdown on Thursday night and caught four passes for 43 yards. This is his third straight game with a trip to the end zone. While he only saw seven targets Thursday night, his workload should be higher in most weeks, especially with Antonio Callaway waived.</p>
      <p>Beckham was targeted ten times and caught four passes for 60 yards. He looked great on the first drive and made a 43-yard catch that was overturned. The Browns wideouts are dead even in both receptions and yards on the season, but Landry now has three touchdowns to Beckham’s one. Both will have good potential against the Dolphins next week.</p>
      <h3>6. Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt both play roles</h3>
      <p>Chubb had another dominant game with 27 rushes for 92 yards. While he did not score, this is his seventh game this year with at least 20 rushing attempts and maintains RB1 status on workload alone.</p>
      <p>Hunt had only six attempts for 12 yards, but he caught six passes on eight targets for 46 yards. He has fit in nicely as a pass catcher in this offense since returning from suspension. Both running backs have good fantasy value moving forward.</p>
