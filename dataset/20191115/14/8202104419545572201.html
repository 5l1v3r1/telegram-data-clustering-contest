      <h3>Saskatchewan trade representatives are in Germany this week, hoping to help local agricultural technology firms crack into international markets.</h3>
      <p>The Saskatchewan Trade and Export Partnership (STEP) has organized a trade mission of provincial businesses to Agritechnica, a biennial trade show in Hanover, Germany that will attract an estimated 450,000 visitors from more than 130 countries.</p>
      <p>Last year, the delegation made nearly 7,000 contacts from 63 countries, through which nearly 2,500 trade leads developed, STEP president and CEO Chris Dekker said.</p>
      <p>“The scale of it is mind-boggling,” said STEP senior manufacturing director Rob Ziola.</p>
      <p>“That’s the reason we really came here. It’s the efficiency of doing business in one place, and over seven days you can hit 50 countries.”</p>
      <p>Schulte Industries is one of more than 20 Saskatchewan firms at the show. Hal Carnago, the company’s sales and marketing manager, said it’s been a good opportunity to pick up more clients across the globe. Six years ago, he met a Japanese distributer who bought 64 snowblowers for the small island of Hokkaido.</p>
      <p>“You’d never think your company from Saskatchewan would sell that many units to one island in Japan,” Carnago remarked.</p>
      <p>Their attendance at the show <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/sask-party-pledges-to-help-farmers-as-part-of-new-growth-plan">aligns with the provincial government’s new growth plan</a>, which includes a $240,000 contract with Harper &amp; Associates, the consulting firm started by former prime minister Stephen Harper, to expand access to foreign markets. The plan also includes a focus on rural tech hubs to foster a <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/business/local-business/canadian-farmers-slow-to-warm-to-ai-automation">growing agricultural tech sector</a>.</p>

      <p>In a statement, provincial government spokesman Matthew Glover said strengthening trade ties with European Member states, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/two-years-in-ceta-only-just-bearing-fruit-for-sask-agriculture-industry">almost half of whom have ratified a free trade agreement with Canada</a>, is key to reducing reliance on <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/amid-china-trade-woes-sask-exports-to-europe-suddenly-soar">markets like China</a>.</p>
      <p>In a release, Minister of Advanced Education and Minister Responsible for Innovation Tina Beaudry-Mellor hammered home that point, noting the province exports 70 per cent of what it produces. </p>
      <p>After the trade show concludes, government representatives will continue to a meeting of UNESCO in France where they will advocate for greater acceptance of different educational credentials across different sectors, part of an effort to encourage qualified immigrants to work and live in the province.</p>
      <p>Carnago said one of the most striking parts of the conference, apart from its size, is the scale of the technology present, including innovations like self-driving tractors or <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/sask-entrepreneur-hopes-space-invader-tech-will-reshape-ag-industry">drones that can selectively dispense pesticides</a>. Ziola said one Saskatchewan firm unveiled a piece of machinery that could eradicate wheat seeds by crushing them, eliminating the need for herbicides.</p>
      <p>The show concludes on Nov. 17.</p>
