      <p>Doctors Without Borders on Friday warned that the improvised Vucjak refugee camp in northwestern Bosnia does not meet minimum living standards, describing it as a “dangerous and inhumane place.”</p>
      <p>Bosnia has been overwhelmed by the influx of thousands of people fleeing violence or poverty in their home countries. Most flock to the northwest section of the Balkan country, which borders European Union member Croatia.</p>
      <p>This has led to tensions in the border region, with authorities there demanding that other parts of the country share the burden.</p>
