      <p>TikTok, the short-video making app, has crossed the 1.5 billion downloads mark from the Play Store and the App Store combined.</p>
      <p>According to a report published by analytics firm <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-1-5-billion">SensorTower</a>, the ByteDance almost third of them (468 million) coming from India. Earlier this year, a report published by <a href="https://thenextweb.com/in/2019/03/13/report-india-accounts-for-a-quarter-of-tiktoks-billion-downloads/">SensorTower</a> suggested Tiktop surpassed the mark of a billion downloads – with India contributing a quarter of them.</p>

      <p>SensorTower says the app has been downloaded 614 million times this year, six percent more than last year’s downloads at the same point. The research firm also noted the video-making app hit the mark of 655 million unique downloads last year. </p>
      <p>Only apps downloaded more than TikTok are WhatsApp (707.4 million) and Messenger (636.2 million).</p>
      <p> The company has been making several changes worldwide. It’s testing <a href="https://twitter.com/iamfabianbern/status/1195048398329696256">a social commerce feature</a> by allowing to add URLs in bio. Last month, it launched an <a href="https://thenextweb.com/in/2019/10/17/tiktok-enters-the-elearning-market-with-its-edutok-program-in-india/">eLearning program called EduTok</a> in India and banned <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2019/10/04/after-india-tiktok-bans-paid-political-ads-in-us-and-eu/">political ads in the EU and the US</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Facebook launched <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2019/11/12/instagram-tries-to-mimic-tiktok-with-its-new-reels-feature-in-brazil/">a TikTok-like feature called ‘Reels’</a> in Instagram Stories in Brazil. The social network has been trying to surpass TikTok in many ways. But it hasn’t found a way to beat it yet.</p>
