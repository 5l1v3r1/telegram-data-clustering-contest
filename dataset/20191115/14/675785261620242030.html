      <h2>Alina Andreea only started applying for things in March, but in far less than a year she's bagged freebies worth £900 - including designer makeup that would have set her back hundreds on its own</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:53:45+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year Alina Andreea started looking to see if there were any freebies she could pick up on the internet.</p>
      <p>Working as a duty manager at a guesthouse in Bath, she was keen to see what she could get from a few minutes looking a dat.</p>
      <p>It's fair to say it worked with the 25-year-old picking up and incredible £900 worth of goodies in a a few months.</p>
      <p>And now she's shared her tactics as well as some of her biggest success stories to give other bargain hunters a helping hand.</p>
      <p>“I apply daily and receive freebies three to four times a week - I’m always following the postman!” Alina told members of the freebie site <a href="https://www.latestfreestuff.co.uk/">LatestFreeStuff.co.uk</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group.</p>

      <p>“Usually, I get the freebies from the Free Stuff Facebook group or from active ads on Facebook.</p>
      <p>“I am also registered with Home Tester Club, TryIt and Alba Science. I have saved around £900 since March this year when I discovered the freebie group on Facebook.</p>
      <p>"I always feel happy when I get a freebie, especially when it's make-up, as working as a duty manager I always need to look good so a make-up freebie is always a joy - also, the make-up samples are so handy for holidays.”</p>
      <p>Alina added that she checks Facebook groups daily to stay up to date.</p>
      <p>"To make sure I don't miss a freebie, I have joined Latest Free Stuff’s Telegram group, and I like the Facebook pages of cosmetic brands (for example MAC, Estee Lauder, Clarins and YSL) as there are active ads from where I get free samples,” she added.</p>
      <p>"For example, I have around 60 foundation samples, so this means around 10 full size bottles that would have cost me probably £280!”</p>

      <p>And here top advice for people looking to get involved is simple.</p>
      <p>"Do not give up!” Alina said.</p>
      <p>"I always see people saying they are applying but they don’t receive anything or the lady from the counter was rude and didn’t give them any samples - this takes time and if someone says no just try again tomorrow when is a different person at the counter!”</p>
      <p>LatestFreeStuff.co.uk founder Deepak Tailor said: “Success stories like Alina’s ... prove that five minutes of work and research every day can add up to thousands in savings."</p>
