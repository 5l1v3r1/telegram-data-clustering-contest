      <p>Over 15 years ago in 2004, Motorola launched the RAZR phone. It was one highly success phone series that lasted until 2007. It briefly had a comeback in 2011 when the Motorola Droid Razr for Verizon Wireless was launched.

It was officially launched a couple of days ago after months of leaks, speculations, and rumors. Teasers have been stirring excitement among the Motorola fans and the rest of the Android community who are very much interested in foldable phones.</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Fold and the Huawei Mate X suddenly have a close rival in the Motorola RAZR. It’s not exactly the same form but the flexible display is impressive.
