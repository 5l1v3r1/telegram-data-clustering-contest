      <h1>Uploading handbook undermining Ambedkar a well-hatched conspiracy: Dalit organisations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:19:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-CorrespondentHUBBALLI-69543/" target="_blank">Special CorrespondentHUBBALLI</a></address>
      <p>Terming the recent uploading of a handbook on the Constitution on the website of Education Department that allegedly undermined B.R. Ambedkar “a well hatched conspiracy” , various Dalit organisations have warned of filing complaints in various police stations if criminal cases are not filed against the concerned officials.</p>
      <p>Addressing presspersons here on Friday, convener of Vividh Dalit Sangh-Sansthegala Mahamandal Gurunath Ullikashi alleged that the act was not just an error of the four suspended officials.</p>
      <p>“We will start filing complaints against at all police stations in Hubballi-Dharwad if the State government fails to file criminal cases against officials of the Education Department and private individuals who are involved in undermining Dr. Ambedkar,” he warned.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ullikashi said that the handbook had reference of a circular number: 2-7/2016-EE.3, issued by Ministry of Human Resources Development on November 22, 2016, and it was nothing but a conspiracy by the State and Union governments.</p>
      <p>He alleged that the suspension of four officials was just an eyewash to cover up the bigger conspiracy.</p>
      <p>“Now even that specific HRD circular has also been taken off from the official website,” he said.</p>
      <p>The government should file criminal cases against all the officials concerned and head of CMCA Ashish Patil, he said, adding that the organisations did not know whether the officials suspended were really involved in the act.</p>
      <p>“But if they are involved, then file criminal cases against them. Principal Secretary to the Government Umashankar should be dismissed for this irresponsible act,” he said.</p>
      <p>President of Dharwad district unit of Bahujan Samaj Party Premanath Chikkatumbal said that because of the Constitution framed by B.R. Ambedkar, a tea-vendor had become the Prime Minister of the country.</p>
      <p>After gaining power both at centre and the State, the BJP was trying to defame Ambedkar and when caught, a few officials were being made the scapegoats, he alleged.</p>
      <p>Other office-bearers Shankar Bhojagar and Lohit Gamanagatti said that a failure to file criminal cases by November 22 would mean that the State government supported the act of the officials.</p>
      <p>“We will be forced to intensify out agitation and demand the resignation of Minister S. Suresh Kumar. If that does not happen, then we will file complaints in all police stations in Hubballi-Dharwad,” they added.</p>
