      <h1>Next-gen Mercedes-Benz GLA: New details surface</h1>

      <p>India-bound, second-gen GLA SUV to get more crossover-inspired design cues; will be shorter and taller than the current model.</p>
      <p>Mercedes-Benz is set to replace the first-gen GLA with an all-new model in the coming weeks. Now, more details about the brand’s entry-level SUV have surfaced, giving a hint at what to expect from it.</p>
      <p>As with other ‘compact’ Mercedes models – like the new A-class, the CLA and GLB SUV – the GLA too will be underpinned by the carmaker’s latest MFA-II platform. Mercedes is going for a more crossover-inspired look for the GLA and has given the model a more upright design, rather than the flowing look of the current model. The new design means that the second-gen GLA is about 100mm taller than the current model, and while its length will be down by 20mm, its wheelbase will be about 30mm longer, which should liberate more space within the cabin.</p>
      <p>Inside, the cabin will share much with the new A-class and GLB, with a digital instrument cluster and infotainment display housed within a single binnacle, turbine-inspired air-con vents, along with plenty of trim inserts and leather. Like on the GLB, the new GLA could also receive an adjustable rear seat.</p>
      <p>Moving to the engines and gearboxes, the new GLA will feature Mercedes’ family of four-cylinder mills. The petrol line-up will include the choice of a 1.3- and 2.0-litre unit developing 165hp and 228hp, respectively. On the diesel front, the SUV will get the choice of a 1.5- or 2.0-litre motor, with the latter coming in two states of tune. The 1.5-litre unit will be good for 115hp, with the 2.0-litre developing either 150hp or a more potent 190hp, depending on its state of tune. Joining the line-up next year will be a 218hp petrol plug-in-hybrid variant, pairing the 1.3-litre engine with a gearbox-mounted electric motor – similar to that on the new A-class. It is expected to use a 15.6kWh battery pack, giving it an all-electric range of more than 60km.</p>
      <p>Also on the cards are the more performance-oriented AMG GLA 35 and 45 models, which are expected to debut in the second-half of 2020.</p>
      <p>Front-wheel drive will be standard, with Mercedes offering a revised version of its 4Matic four-wheel drive that’s capable of fully variable power apportioning to either the front or rear wheels as an option. Gearbox choices will include a 6-speed manual, 7-speed automatic and an 8-speed dual-clutch auto.</p>
      <p>For the Indian market, there is no confirmation yet on the launch of the second-gen GLA, though Mercedes is set to launch a host of new and updated models in the coming year, including all-new models like the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mercedes-benz/a-class-sedan"><b>A-class sedan</b></a>, <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glb"><b>GLB</b></a>, <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mercedes-benz/new-gle"><b>GLE</b></a> and <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mercedes-benz/new-gls"><b>GLS</b></a> and <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glc-facelift"><b>GLC facelift</b></a>. Like the current model, the new GLA will go up against the BMW X1 and Volvo XC40 in the market.</p>
