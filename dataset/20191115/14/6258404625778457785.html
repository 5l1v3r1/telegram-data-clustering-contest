      <h1>Hulu Smacks Live TV Customers With Second Big Rate Hike For 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:16:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hothardware.com/author/Brandon-Hill" target="_blank">Brandon Hill</a></address>

      <p>It looks as though cord cutters are increasingly coming under attack by <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/att-tv-now-directv-streaming-price-gouging">some of the same tactics</a> that prompted their move away from "Big Cable". Hulu announced today that it is once again raising prices on its Live TV service for customers; its second such rate hike in less than a year.</p>
      <p>Starting on December 18<sup>th</sup>, <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/hulu-live-tv-streaming-service-brings-50-channels-and-cloud-dvr-for-40">Hulu Live TV</a> customers will be paying $54.99/month, which is a $10 increase from the previous $44.99/month price. If you recall, Hulu already raised the price of its Live TV service from $39.99/month to <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/hulus-most-popular-plan-falls-to-6-per-month">$45.99/month back in January</a>.</p>
      <p>According to Hulu, this price increase "better reflects the substantial value of Hulu + Live TV and allows us to continue offering all of the popular live news, sports and entertainment programming included in the plan." However, we're not so certain that customers will appreciate an overall $15 increase within a year's time.</p>
      <p>Hulu goes on to state that it's "never easy to stomach" price increases, and even says that it has made it easier for customer to switch their plans if they don't want to pay top dollar all year long. "If you love college football, choose Hulu + Live TV during the season, then switch to one of Hulu’s less expensive on-demand plans when it’s over," Hulu writes. "If you enjoy most of your TV on demand but really want to watch live election news, just switch to Hulu + Live TV for a few months."</p>
      <p>By all accounts, it doesn't look like customers will be getting any additional channels with the price hike to help soften the blow.</p>
      <p>Hulu isn't the only company that has drawn scrutiny recently for its price hikes. AT&amp;T is currently facing lawsuits for <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/att-slapped-with-class-action-suit-over-directv-now-pricing">raising prices on DirecTV Now/AT&amp;T Now customers</a> after telling the government that it wouldn’t do so if its merger with Time Warner was approved.</p>
