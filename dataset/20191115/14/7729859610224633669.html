        <b>Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke has been slammed by a magistrate after he was banned from driving for a series of speeding offences.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Benteke, who already had nine points on his licence for previous offences, was handed a 12-month road ban at London's Lavender Hill Magistrates Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>Chairwoman of the bench Pamela Stokes said the 28-year-old Belgian international, who did not attend the hearing, had "fallen far short" of being a role model to fans.</p>
      <p>She said: "I note that Benteke is someone who has offended before, and I also noted the very high speeds recorded for these matters before us today.</p>
      <p>"Benteke is a well-known footballer who has many fans, and he should be seen as a role model to those fans - his offending has fallen far short of being a role model."</p>
      <p>The court heard Benteke, of Kingston Hill, Surrey, was caught driving his Bentley at 80mph in a 50mph zone on the A3 in Richmond, south-west London, on January 20.</p>
      <p>He was later clocked at 89mph in a 40mph zone on a stretch of the same road in Putney on March 11. He admitted both offences.</p>
      <p>He was also found guilty of driving the vehicle at 64mph in a 30mph zone in Streatham Place, south-west London, on July 22.</p>
      <p>Benteke was also ordered to pay £2,780 in fines, costs and surcharges.</p>

      <p>Benteke was given six penalty points for each of the three new speeding offences which were dealt with by the court on Friday.</p>
      <p>He was also ordered to pay £800 in fines for each of these offences, along with £100 in costs for each matter and a £80 surcharge.</p>
      <p>Benteke apologised through his lawyer Quentin Hunt for not attending the hearing as it clashed with a commitment to be with the Belgian national team in Russia.</p>
      <p>The footballer also apologised for his actions.</p>
      <p>Mr Hunt told the court: "He has asked me specifically to apologise to the court and the general public in respect of his behaviour on speeding matters.</p>
      <p>"He is acutely aware that he maybe seen by some as a role model to young people and his behaviour should reflect as such. His pattern of speeding is unacceptable."</p>
      <p>Mr Hunt added that Benteke "has not in the manner of other celebrities tried on technical grounds to get out of" taking responsibility for his actions.</p>
      <p>Mr Hunt said: "He does not wish to put forward any excuses for his behaviour. He realises he should not have been speeding in the way that he did."</p>
      <p>Mr Hunt described the court proceedings as an "eye opener" for Benteke whom he said had lived quite a long way from his training ground and had wanted to get home to see his young family.</p>
      <p>Benteke has recently moved home, the court was told.</p>
      <p>Accepting the need for a driving ban, Mr Hunt added: "As a figure in the public eye it is difficult for him to get public transport but his means are such that he can organise for someone to drive him."</p>
