      <h1>Visalandhra book exhibition beckons readers</h1>

      <p>With categorisation and targeted display that keeps in view preference of various age groups, the ongoing Visalandhra Book Exhibition offers a wide variety with focus on Telugu books and translations.</p>
      <p>The display of titles is equitably done, whether it’s niche section like feminist literature or progressive writing or cinema or books on Sanskrit kavyas or religious/spiritual, at the Turner’s Choultry, the venue of the annual exhibition.</p>
      <p>Telugu literature gets a pride of place. Several volumes of Sripada Subrahmanya Sastry’s stories or 30 books brought out by Abhyudaya Rachayitala Sangham, Guntur district, catch one’s eye as does ‘Vandella Kadhaku Vandanalu,’ edited by noted writer Gollapudi Maruti Rao and comprising 116 stories,</p>
      <p>Books on cinema get a prominent display with one on superstar of yesteryears Krishna prominently displayed.</p>
      <p>That a book exhibition kindles the interest of students or readers is quite obvious. Srilakshmi, a young student from near the Old Post Office, scans the books to see whether she could find something to start with in B.Sc., Nursing course. A middle-aged man was in search of books on Yoga, revealing how the reader’s interest is not confined to just fiction or textbooks.</p>
      <p>Apart from children’s literature, pictorial biographies of prominent personalities would be a source of inspiration.</p>
      <p>“Some books arouse interest with their focus on issues,” says K. Madhusudan, senior announcer of All India Radio, pointing out at titles like ‘The Secret Diary of Kasturba,’ ‘Jesus in India’ and ‘The Promise of India.’</p>
      <p>“We have tried to bring new titles to the exhibition. A translation of Ayn Rand’s ‘The Fountainhead,’ a reprint of the translation of ‘War and Peace’ after a long time, translation of student leader Kanhaiya Kumar’s autobiography, ‘Kalingandhra Charitra and Samskruti’ and ‘Ni Uttaram Andindi,’ letters received by Chaganti Somayajulu from various literary personalities and edited by Chaganti Tulasi are among them,” says Manager of Visalandhra Book House P.A. Raju. A total of 25,000 titles brought out by 55 publishers are on display.</p>
      <p>Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s ‘Na Diary,’ a book chronicling his ‘Praja Sankalpa Yatra’ from Idupulapaya to Ichchapuram is designed in the format of a dairy with photographs.</p>
      <p>For old timers, Sherlock Holmes, Telugu novels from Ranganayakamma to Yaddanpudi Sulochana Rani and Kommuri Sambasiva Rao’s ‘whodunits’ should be a walk down the memory lane. Classics find their place as well.</p>
