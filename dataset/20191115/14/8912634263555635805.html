      <p>ISTANBUL: Turkey said Friday it had expelled more than 40,000 refugees living in Istanbul and sent them back to the provinces where they were initially registered.<br/>A campaign was run from July through to the end of October, aimed at reducing the number of refugees in Turkey’s biggest city and economic hub.<br/>The country hosts some 3.6 million Syrian refugees — more than any other country — though technically they are only under “temporary protection” because the government does not offer them formal refugee status.<br/>Under the system, they must stay in the province to which they were initially assigned, and can only visit other cities with short-term passes.<br/>The Istanbul governor’s office said 42,888 migrants were rounded up by police and sent back to their assigned provinces between July and October, without specifying their nationalities.<br/>It said in July that 547,000 Syrians were officially registered in Istanbul, and that no new registrations were being accepted.<br/>Turkey has faced limited social problems despite the refugee influx from the eight-year conflict in its southern neighbor.<br/>But an economic downturn has sharpened tensions, and analysts say the refugee issue likely contributed to the ruling party’s surprise defeat in the Istanbul mayoral election this year.<br/>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought to defuse the issue with plans to create a “safe zone” in northern Syria to which refugees can return, though rights groups have cast doubt on the feasibility of the plan.</p>
