      <p>A pioneering scheme created by a former Plymouth police officer and a Torpoint headteacher to safeguard children who are victims of domestic abuse has won the first ever World Class Policing award.</p>
      <p>Devon and Cornwall Police accepted the inaugural award at a ceremony at the Grosvenor Hotel in London which was attended by Chief Police officers from across the globe.</p>
      <p>The force beat off competition from 54 finalists, drawn from more than 100 outstanding entries from across the globe, to claim the overall prize at the new event recognising outstanding police worldwide. Categories winners hailed from Australia, Dubai, New Zealand as well as the UK.</p>
      <p>Former Devonport-based Sgt David Carney-Haworth and his wife, Torpoint Nursery and Infant School headteacher Elisabeth, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/new-scheme-safeguard-children-domestic-544378">created Operation Encompass in 2011 which shared police reports of domestic abuse</a> incidents where children had been present with key adults at the schools they attend.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The calls are made before the youngsters arrive at school the following morning, giving teaching staff ample time to prepare and offer whatever support the child needs.</p>
      <p>Operation Encompass was initially rolled out to a handful of Plymouth schools and quickly garnered praise from a number of senior police officers, the city’s MPs and councillors, government ministers, Plymouth City Council’s director of children’s services as well as experts in the field of domestic violence and child psychology.</p>
      <p>The couple have continually campaigned to ensure the scheme is introduced amongst all the police forces in England and Wales and have even been approached by international police forces and educational establishments keen to take up Operation Encompass.</p>

      <p>The scheme went on to gain wholehearted support from the charity Women’s Aid. After becoming a charitable organisation, it also saw BBC presenter and <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/dame-esther-rantzen-urges-support-777893">Childline creator Dame Esther Rantzen</a> and Dame Vera Baird QC, the former Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria and former Solicitor General for England and Wales - and now Victims Commissioner - accept roles as patrons.</p>
      <p>The actual application for the World Class Policing award was written by David Carney-Haworth, with assistance from Richard Marsh, former Stoke Damerel Primary school headteacher, with Devon and Cornwall Police as the partner force.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the World Class Policing Awards said judges were "really impressed and moved" by the nomination.</p>
      <p>They said: "Operation Encompass deals with a perennial issue that happens behind closed doors, affects generations and has a pernicious effect on society.</p>

      <p>"As a charity/police/education collaboration its exceptional and most importantly it has been sustained. It has now had almost complete UK saturation and has spread to other countries. There are rightly many testimonials of its effectiveness."</p>
      <p>The judges noted how in some cases, knowing that Operation Encompass support was in place, also saw children self-refer to the school's welfare teams.</p>
      <p>The judges felt the operation had transformed how information and data was shared and meant officers now had the tools and resources to offer practical and rapid support for children involved.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>They noted how officers had previously felt 'ashamed and guilty' because there was no practical support in place to help to children going through the trauma of domestic abuse. Now they are able to reassure families that help is available through the Operation Encompass programme.</p>
      <p>In September 2014 the scheme was rolled out across the Merseyside Police force area before being picked up by Cheshire police and Cleveland Police’s force area. Since then the scheme is engaged by 37 forces across the UK, with plans to launch it in Northern Ireland in the near future. It has also garnered interest from police forces and educational establishments in the Netherlands, USA and Australia.</p>
      <p>It also secured the backing of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services' (HMICFRS). Zoe Billingham, the HMICRFS's lead on domestic abuse, She  has said that her her organisation immediately recognised the huge value of the scheme when she first started working with Elisabeth and David Carney-Haworth.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/governments-inspectors-police-recommend-plymouth-796699">She has described the scheme as “fantastic” and “beautiful”</a> adding: "It’s an absolute no-brainer. Why wouldn’t you support it? I don’t think I’ve every come across a scheme so simple and have so profound an effect on a child.”</p>
      <p>The Awards spokesman concluded: "This is an outstanding example of collaboration with high impact among vulnerable children and a national reach.</p>
      <p>"It was also good use of new technology. A relatively simple set of changes around information sharing, but combined with a very impressive focus on good quality training and informed by the latest research in terms of trauma informed practice."</p>

      <p>The World Class Policing Awards specifically recognise and celebrate the collaborative nature of policing - whether that is a brilliant investigation, a business change project or a multi-agency partnership - in delivering the most effective and efficient way to protect our communities and keep them safe.</p>
      <p>Devon and Cornwall’s Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez has congratulated the team behind Operation Encompass after the Plymouth-based scheme scooped top prize at the prestigious World Class Policing Awards.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the awards, Ms Hernandez said: "Elizabeth and David deserve all the credit for Operation Encompass and you can't get much higher  praise than World recognition.</p>
      <p>"Though the scheme started in Plymouth it took some time for Devon and Cornwall Police to fully embrace it into business as usual but its effects are now being felt by children here and in forces across the country. Its impact will be felt throughout their lives."</p>
      <p>The history of the scheme has not always been plain sailing. By 2014, when other forces in the country were make huge strides in rolling it out across their entire force areas, Operation Encompass appeared to have lost favour with Devon and Cornwall Police and even the then Police and Crime Commissioner.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Schools began to complain that they were not receiving calls and an investigation by Plymouth Live revealed that pilot schemes the force claimed it had launched in 2012 were no longer running - even though it had told the Home Office the scheme was still in place. </p>
      <p>Plymouth Live also revealed how the scheme <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/devon-cornwall-police-failing-vulnerable-777367">had effectively been taken out of the hands of Sgt Carney-Haworth in late 2012 by a senior officer</a> and was passed to community officers, resulting in the near-collapse of the entire initiative.</p>
      <p>A bitter battled ensued between David and Elisabeth and the Devon and Cornwall Police over the existence of the scheme, while at the same time more and more police forces and education authorities in other parts of the country were desperate to see Operation Encompass set up in their own areas and were calling upon the couple to develop the scheme and see their staff trained.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, in part because of the personal intervention by Devon and Cornwall Police's Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer and Asst Chief Constable Andy Boulting, the scheme was finally reinstated in full<a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/police-plymouth-finally-adopt-new-1035138"> and rolled out across the entire force area</a>.</p>
      <p>In June this year David and Elisabeth <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/plymouth-couple-behind-safeguarding-scheme-2954013">were made OBEs due to their work safeguarding children</a>.</p>

      <p>Speaking from their home in South East Cornwall David told Plymouth Live both he and Elisabeth were proud the Operation Encompass scheme has won the overall World Class Policing Award.</p>
      <p>He said: "This award is particularly important to me, being a police officer for many years and creating this scheme with my wife while I was still working as a neighbourhood sergeant in Devonport. The partnership work we were able to do, thanks to the foresight and positivity by local schools, has meant we were able to create a scheme which was simple but effective - not just in Devonport, not just in Plymouth or Devon and Cornwall, but across the whole country.</p>
      <p>"The many training sessions we did with teachers and police officer across Devon and Cornwall, and in other force areas, was a constant learning curve and we adapted the training to ensure the key people who would become vital in supporting child victims had the most up-to-date knowledge about domestic violence and its long-term effects.</p>

      <p>"Ultimately, we could have chosen any of the forces who have supported and championed Operation Encompass from its creation in 2011, but we chose Devon and Cornwall Police because we created the scheme in Devonport, working with local schools and receiving support from the local authority."</p>
      <p>Elisabeth Carney-Haworth said the award meant Operation Encompass would now be "elevated onto an even stronger international platform because there were police at the ceremony from all across the world."</p>
      <p>She added: "We have often said since creating the scheme that wherever there is domestic violence, wherever there are children, there should be Operation Encompass. It should be in every force, in every school, for every child. Those children deserve it.</p>

      <p>"I also hope the award will strengthen our influence with the Government in this country to make sure that children are finally recognised in law as victims of domestic abuse in their own right. Current legislation - and proposed legislation - does not do this."</p>
      <p>In addition to being crowned overall winner, Devon and Cornwall Police also received a highly commended for its work with the Jewish community in the wake of a terrorist attack on Exeter City's Synagogue.</p>
      <p>It was highlighted for demonstrating not only the importance of every officer in the fight against terror, but also the importance of working closely with all agencies and sharing information effectively.</p>
