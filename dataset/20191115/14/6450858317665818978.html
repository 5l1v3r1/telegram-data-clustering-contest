      <p>The Google Nest Hub Max released earlier this year as an update to what was known as the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/google-home-hub-3685068/">Google Home Hub</a>. As an always-on and always-connected smart display supported by Google Assistant, you can use voice commands to remotely get information (like weather or traffic updates) or play music as you would with any smart speaker – but the added benefit of a 10in HD screen and a built-in Nest Cam camera means you can also watch videos, see photos, and make video calls.</p>
      <p>The Nest Cam features a 127-degree field of vision, which means it can track you during video calls even if you move out of the frame – a handy feature if you're on a call while busy with other things (don't worry, you will see a green light and a pop-up notification whenever the camera is on). </p>
