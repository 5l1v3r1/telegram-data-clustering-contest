      </p>
      <p>The man had been connected to the murders of Hess, who was a first-year theology student at the University of the Western Cape, and her grandfather via circumstantial evidence, the police confirmed this week.</p>
      <p>As of Friday, he is still only a person of interest in the murder case.</p>
      <p>Hess and Lategan were found dead in the family's Parow flat on August 30 this year after reportedly being strangled.</p>
      <p>A TV set, two cellphones and her backpack were stolen from the house.</p>
      <p>There was no sign of forced entry, leading the Hess family to believe Jesse and Lategan might have known their assailant.</p>
      <p>Her aunt, Sandy Hess, who was devastated after it was established her relative was allegedly linked to the murders, said their families had had a good relationship.</p>
      <p>Their household had visited the relative's home often as the suspect's mother had been ill. His mother died six months ago.</p>
      <p>The case was postponed to February 14.</p>
