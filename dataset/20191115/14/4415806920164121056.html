      <p>Blackburn Rovers defender Derrick Williams has been ruled out of Monday's European Championship qualifier against Denmark.</p>
      <p>Williams returned to his club for treatment of a calf sprain her injured during yesterday's 3-1 win over New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy told <a href="https://www.fai.ie/">FAI.ie</a>: â€œDerrick felt his calf in the second half of the game and our medical team have assessed him today.</p>
      <blockquote>He will go back to his club now and we wish him well. He was one of our best players on Thursday night and deserved his goal.</blockquote>
      <p>McCarthy said he has no plans to add to his 25 man squad before Monday's match in the Aviva Stadium.</p>
      <p>Kick off is 7:45pm and will be live on RTE 2.</p>
