      <h1>London to South West train line reopens following a week of disruption</h1>
      <h2>It caused plenty of disruption</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:09:23+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>The main South West to London train line has reopened following major works.</p>
      <p>Commuters faced disruption for almost a week because of work to carry out track renewal of a major junction on the Great Western Main Line near Taunton.</p>
      <p>The work was successfully completed in the early hours of Friday morning, re-opening the line between Tiverton Parkway and Castle Cary/Weston-super-Mare.</p>
      <p>Network Rail also completed upgrades to Whiteball Tunnel (near Tiverton Parkway) which has been reinforced with concrete, securing its use for the years ahead.</p>
      <p>During the six-day closure of the line, Great Western Railway (GWR) diverted trains running between London Paddington and the South West, ensuring a direct rail service into the south west remained operational. An extensive rail replacement operation also ensured customers could still travel between Bristol and the South West.</p>

      <p>Upgrades to the junction and tunnel were a milestone in the build-up to GWR’s biggest timetable change in a generation and will help trains to run more reliably, as well as reducing the need for more closures in the future.</p>
      <p>GWR Managing Director Mark Hopwood thanked passengers for their patience and reminded them of the changes ahead which these improvement works are helping to bring.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are now just a matter of weeks away from the biggest timetable change on the Great Western network since the 1970s, enabling us to take advantage of the full benefits that new Intercity Express Trains, and improved track signalling systems, are bringing.</p>
      <p>From December 15th, in providing more frequent and quicker journeys, our new timetable will for the vast majority of users quite literally mean ‘all change please’ and we encourage those travelling to check their usual journeys beforehand.”</p>
      <p>Train services between Devon and Cornwall and London will be restructured to deliver a more consistent service pattern throughout the day, offering faster typical journey times and more frequent services to key locations from December this year.</p>
      <p>Network Rail‘s Western Route Director Mike Gallop said: “The completion of this track maintenance work is an important step in the count down to the introduction of the new timetable in December, which will allow passengers to benefit from more frequent and faster journeys.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank both passengers and residents for their patience while we carried out this essential work.”</p>
