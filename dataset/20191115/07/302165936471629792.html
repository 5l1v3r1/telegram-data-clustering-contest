      <p>LONDON, Nov 15 — A thief made what police said was an “audacious” attempt to steal two Rembrandt paintings from a London museum but fled without them after being confronted, authorities said yesterday.</p>
      <p>The suspect broke into Dulwich Picture Gallery at about 11:30pm (2330 GMT) on Wednesday, police said, targeting “Rembrandt’s Light”, a new exhibition showing 35 of the Dutch master’s paintings, etchings and drawings.</p>
      <p>A gallery spokeswoman declined to identify the two paintings which were briefly taken.</p>
      <p>But she told AFP that Rembrandt’s portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III — dubbed the “takeaway Rembrandt” as it has been stolen four times from the gallery — was not involved.</p>
      <p>“An intruder appears to have forced entry to the gallery and removed the two paintings,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>An alarm was triggered and officers arrived within minutes. They challenged the suspect and one of them gave chase, only to be sprayed in the face by an unknown substance.</p>
      <p>The officer had no serious injuries but the suspect got away. Both paintings were swiftly recovered, and never left the gallery’s grounds, police said.</p>
      <p>“This was an audacious attempted burglary and was clearly planned in advance,” said Detective Inspector Jason Barber from the Flying Squad, the police unit which deals with robberies.</p>
      <p>The “takeaway Rembrandt” was first stolen in 1966 as part of a bigger heist involving eight Old Masters, which were all eventually recovered.</p>
      <p>In 1973, a visitor stuffed it into a plastic bag and made off on his bicycle, although he was arrested within minutes by local police, according to the book “Stealing Rembrandts”.</p>
      <p>In 1981, two thieves walked in — again in broad daylight — and distracted the security guard while taking the pocket-sized treasure off the wall.</p>
      <p>They attempted to blackmail the gallery with the painting but were caught a fortnight later.</p>
      <p>Despite a new security system, the Rembrandt was stolen again in 1983, when the robbers broke in at night through a skylight. They triggered the alarm but police were too late.</p>
      <p>It was not recovered for three years, when investigators acting on a tip found it in a box in a railway station in a British army base in West Germany.</p>
      <p>No arrests were ever made. — AFP</p>
