      <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo got 38 points and 15 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the the Chicago Bulls 124-115.</p>
      <p>Not that Antetokounmpo was a one-man team; Eric Bledsoe added a season-high 31 points and eight assists to help the Bucks to their seventh straight win over the Bulls.</p>
      <p>Chicago’s 19-year-old rookie Coby White did his best to stem the tide, though, shooting five of eight from three-point range in the first half, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to hit five three-pointers in consecutive games.</p>
      <p>There was some bad news for Milwaukee, however – Antetokounmpo is expected to miss several games with a thigh injury.</p>

      <p>New York Knicks beat Dallas Mavericks 106-103 at Madison Square Garden.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks’ Kristaps Porzingis, who spent the first three-and-a-half years of his career with the Knicks, was booed mercilessly in his first game back at the Garden.</p>
      <p>The booing seemed to put Porzingis off his stride as his side lost their second straight game.</p>
      <p>For the Knicks, the win sees them go to 3-7 and move off the bottom of the Eastern Conference.</p>

      <p>Paul George scored 33 in his debut for the Los Angeles Clippers, but it was not enough to prevent his team losing 132-127 away to the New Orleans Pelicans.</p>
      <p>The home side made 18 of 35 three-pointers on their way to producing their highest point total of the season so far.</p>
      <p>Jrue Holiday was the Pelicans’ highest scorer with 36, while Derrick Favors got 20.</p>
      <p>Despite the much-needed win, New Orleans are still second from bottom in the Western Conference.</p>
