      <p>Alex Akinyele, a former Nigerian information minister and sports manager, has died.</p>
      <p>Mr Akinyele passed on between late Thursday night and early Friday morning, the Nigerian Tribune reported one of his sons, Akinfolarin, as announcing in a statement. He was 81.</p>
      <p>Details of Mr Akinyele’s cause of death were not immediately disclosed, but it was believed to have occurred in his home Ondo State.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the state government did not immediately return requests seeking comments.</p>
      <p>Mr Akinyele served as information minister under Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria’s military ruler between 1985 and 1993.</p>
      <p>It was also during Mr Babangida’s tenure that Mr Akinyele led the Nigerian Sports Commission.</p>
      <p>Mr Akinyele, whose father served in World War II as a member of the elite West African Frontier Force, also had deep professional roots in public relations. He chaired the Nigeria Institute of Public Relations for many years.</p>
      <p>He was born in Ondo State on April 24, 1938 and attended his primary and secondary education there.</p>
      <p>Tributes have been pouring in from some of those who knew him, including from journalist Aliu Olurotimi, a former editor at Daily Times who described the deceased in a Facebook post as a “super orator, mentor and friend for all seasons.”</p>
