      <h1>Pub bombings victims may still be entitled to compensation - J421 campaigner</h1>
      <h2>Victims can claim for financial aid, even though the terrorists struck 45 years ago</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:15:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:15</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Hambleton, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/julie-hambleton/</a></address>
      <p>ON November 21 Birmingham will once again pause and remember those who were murdered by IRA terrorists in the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-pub-bombings">Birmingham pub bombings</a> in 1974.</p>
      <p>It will mark the 45th year since that night of horror.</p>
      <p>Believe me, the nightmare which began then for the families of victims remains as stark and vivid as ever.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of others were injured both physically and mentally after bombers attacked two city centre bars, The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern In The Town.</p>

      <p>Our Tree Memorial, outside New Street Station, will begin at 8pm and end at 8.40pm.</p>
      <p>We are very lucky to have the Choir from Our Lady’s Primary School singing two songs in between poems read by Paul Bridgewater, Risteard Sinclair and Maureen Slattery-Marsh.</p>
      <p>There will also be very short speeches by Professor Gavin Schaffer, West Midlands Lord Mayor Andy Street and Jess Phillips.</p>

      <p>The event will be to pay our respects to those who were slain in cold blood - our loved ones, where politics is completely off the table as always.</p>
      <p>If you would like to attend please email Maurice Malone at the Birmingham Irish Association as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>However, although that event is non political, I do have to flag up an important, separate political matter.</p>
      <p>It may well be that, despite the passage of time, some of those poor souls who were injured may be entitled to compensation.</p>
      <p>The government has been discussing and, prior to the general election being called was in the consultation process of something called: A Legal Framework for a Troubles related incident Victims Payment Scheme Implementation of the legal duty under section 10 of the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc.) Act 2019.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>I know that sounds long-winded but what is means is that anyone who has been impacted, for instance, survivors of a bombing (but not by their own hand) has the right to apply for this Victims Payment Scheme.</p>
      <p>Anyone who wishes to apply must read and complete the questionnaire via this link: https://consultations.nidirect.gov.uk/nio-implementation-team/vpconsultation-1/ or they may contact: Victims Payments Consultation 028 90 520700 or via email: vpconsultation@gov.co.uk</p>
      <p>Our families were only made aware of this via our legal team KRW Law LLP, and as such, we thought this information should be shared to everyone who may wish to apply for this scheme. The consultation closes on November 26, 2019, as such, anyone who is interested only a short time to apply.</p>

      <p>If you were injured in the Birmingham Pub bombings 1974, or anywhere else in the United Kingdom by a terrorist attack during the Troubles, this is something you may be interested in reading and applying for.</p>
      <p>We ask that if there is anyone you know who was involved in the Birmingham Pub bombings 1974, kindly inform them of this consultation, as they may be able to apply for compensation and a pension due to the injuries suffered.</p>

      <p>This has not been promoted in the UK, hence this notice to bring it to everyone’s urgent attention.</p>
      <p>The Government has said:</p>
      <p>More than 21 years on from the signing of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland is a different place in so many positive ways. But the legacy of the Troubles still casts a long shadow over many aspects of life in the here and now.</p>

        <figcaption>How the Birmingham Evening Mail recorded the night of horror</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>More than 3,500 people were killed and an estimated 40,000 injured during that awful period. It is clear through engagement with victims, survivors and others that the hurt and suffering caused by decades of terrible violence have had a profound and deep-rooted impact not just on individuals but on generations of families in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and beyond.</p>
      <p>Those living with the consequences of serious injury do so with a constant reminder of those dark days in our history. Many of their injuries are physical but a significant number of survivors also continue to suffer from deep psychological trauma. It is, therefore, not surprising that many struggle with normal daily routine tasks, and are struggling to cope financially.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There are no easy answers as to how we should address the legacy of Northern Ireland’s past. However, as a society we have a moral duty to acknowledge and recognise the unacceptable suffering of those seriously injured in the Troubles as part of wider efforts to support Northern Ireland in building its future by doing more to address its past.</p>
      <p>The Stormont House Agreement contained a commitment that “further work will be undertaken to seek an acceptable way forward on the proposal for a pension for severely physically injured victims in Northern Ireland”. For too long this matter has stalled on the question of who should and who should not benefit from it.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>In this regard the UK Government has and continues to be clear that those injured by their own hand should not in any way benefit from any proposals to provide acknowledgement and recognition to victims injured through no fault of their own.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>While it will always be the preference of this Government that such provision is made by a Northern Ireland Executive, in its absence we are publishing this proposal for how a scheme could be delivered. This is a crucial element of the Stormont House Agreement’s proposals to help address the legacy of the Troubles, and it is vital that we make progress across this and related matters. We are committed to delivering better outcomes for all those affected by the Troubles and to continuing to play our part in promoting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>We would be grateful to hear views from anyone with an interest in this proposed scheme.</p>
