      <h1>Why LASU is introducing two-stream undergraduate programmes — VC</h1>

      <p>The second stream undergraduate programme of the Lagos State University was introduced to help deepen entrepreneurship skill of students of the institution, Vice Chancellor, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, has said.</p>
      <p>Addressing journalists in Lagos on Thursday, Fagbohun said the entrepreneurship programme, which would run along with normal undergraduate degrees, would prepare students to be self-employed and employers of labour.</p>
      <p>According to the LASU vice chancellor, research indicates that small medium enterprises employ more than 80 per cent of the workforce in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“That is why we have very close working relationship with SMEs, so they can impact on the university and impart right entrepreneurship skills to the students.</p>

      <p>“Before starting, the Stream 2 entrepreneurship programme will go through all the approval processes of the university.</p>
      <p>“Critical thing for LASU is quality assurance which means the two-stream programmes will be standard and run successfully together without any programme failing.</p>
      <p>“We have a directorate of quality assurance that monitors every programme of the university in order to achieve best practices,” the vice chancellor said.</p>
      <p>He said that entrepreneurship courses would be taught only during the first year of the regular Stream 1 programme, while it would be taught throughout the duration of the Stream 2 programme.</p>
      <p>The vice chancellor also refuted speculation that LASU had increased tuition fees for its undergraduate programmes.</p>
      <p>“Our regular Stream 1 programme tuition fee is still N25,000, while medical students pay N37,000. But for Stream 2 entrepreneurship programme, the tuition fee is N150,000, aside of acceptance and medical fee,” he said.</p>
      <p>Also speaking, Prof. Martins Anetekhan, Director, LASU Centre for Entrepreneur, said the university was concerned about widespread unemployment among graduates of Nigerian universities.</p>
      <p>“After investigation, we realise that most graduates are not getting jobs because the available job vacancies can not accommodate them.<br/>“It means they have to be skillful and adjust their mindset to become entrepreneurs who can also employ others and contribute to national development.</p>
      <p>“Apart from giving them knowledge on normal degree programme, LASU introduced Stream 2 programme so they can also acquire some skills, knowledge through entrepreneurship programmes,” he said.</p>
      <p>Anetekhan said that there were 79 different areas of entrepreneurship for the Stream 2 programme and teaching had been arranged such that it would not clash with the normal degree programmes.</p>
      <p>“We should all know that entrepreneurship programme is the delivery of handsome skills and LASU partnered with many small scale industries to teach the students,” he said.</p>
