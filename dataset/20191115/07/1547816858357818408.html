      <p>Music composer-singer Himesh Reshammiya is back once again with the recreated version of the 2006 hit song Aashiqui Mein Teri from Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan starrer 36 China Town. Himesh has sung this song with viral Internet sensation Ranu Mondal. Although Ashiqui Mein Teri  2.0 is a sure shot party anthem Himesh further adds that there is a lot of depth and a very soulful melody attached to the song which has helped to make the love story of Happy Hardy and Heer timeless.  </p>
      <p> “The Blockbuster song Ashiqui Mein Teri 2.0 from Happy Hardy and Heer releases today and I have enjoyed every moment recreating own chartbuster track which I had composed for Shahid Kapoor starrer ‘36 China Town’ a decade back,” said Himesh. This 2.0 version is sung by Himesh and Ranu Mondal, after the super hit song Teri Meri Kahani. Himesh has again given one more opportunity to Ranu Mondal to sing in Ashiqui Mein Teri 2.0 from his movie Happy Hardy and Heer.  Himesh said that in an era where the trailer comes first and then the music comes and becomes popular only after the film hits the screens, this new strategy of releasing the music before the trailer has completely paid off for us with the music becoming such a huge success. The trailer of Happy Hardy and Heer is awaited for a long time and soon the producers Deepshikha Deshmukh will announce the trailer date of Happy Hardy and Heer. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/ranu-mondal-s-don-t-touch-me-moment-gives-birth-to-some-hilarious-memes-pictures-inside/5dc26f8f87fb571eff7e3774">ALSO READ: Ranu Mondal’s ‘Don’t Touch Me’ Moment Gives Birth To Some Hilarious Memes – Pictures Inside</a></p>
