      <p>A member of staff at a Devon hotel that featured on a Channel 5 TV show has claimed they were launched eight feet down a corridor after receiving an electric shock from a faulty light switch.</p>
      <p>Staff and contractors at the Devon Bay Hotel, which featured on The Hotel Inspector show back in July, say it is one of a number of alleged faults at the premises.</p>
      <p>Tradesmen who have worked at the premises in Ilfracombe claim it is "in a bad state" with several electrical problems and water leaking through the roof into buckets.</p>
      <p>It was recently claimed that an electrical issue had stopped the fire alarms from working and at one stage the hotel's kitchen had no lights or power for its fridges.</p>

      <p>North Devon Council's environmental health department say the hotel is contravening health and safety legislation and has issued an improvement notice on the premises.</p>
      <p>The hotel's manager says he is aware of the issues and is trying to get them fixed - but the hotel's owners have remained silent on the matter.</p>
      <p>Devon Live was contacted by one employee of the hotel, who wished to remain nameless, who claimed an electrician had placed five "danger of death" warning notices on the hotel as part of a safety report.Â </p>
      <p>Among the alleged problems were unsafe wall sockets, metal light fittings that were not earthed and a power issue that affected the building's fire alarms.</p>
      <p>Devon Live has also been told that one employee claimed to have been launched eight feet down a corridor after allegedly receiving an electric shock from a faulty light switch.</p>
      <p>The worker told Devon Live that had this happened to one of the hotel's elderly residents they could have died.</p>

      <p>It is understood these more serious "danger of death" issues have now been fixed, but it's believed several further issues remain - including water leaking into rooms.</p>
      <p>North Devon Council said the building had been visited by Environmental Health Officers who declared the hotel was contravening health and safety legislation and electricity at work regulations.</p>
      <p>The council has issued a Health and Safety Improvement Notice on the premises stating the owners have "failed to ensure that electrical systems are maintained so as to prevent danger".</p>
      <p>The notice gives the owners until January 6, 2020, to correct the issues.</p>
      <p>A council spokesman said: "A Health and Safety Improvement Notice was served last week and a copy of the Notice (Front Page Only) is due to be placed on our Public Register of Notices."</p>
      <p>The hotel's manager, Adrian Underhill, said he was aware of the issues.</p>

      <p>He said: "We are trying to get things sorted locally and are continually in touch with Aronex Developments about this."</p>
      <p>DevonLive has attempted to speak to Aronex Developments for a comment but been unable to make contact.</p>
      <p>Adrian and his wife Gill featured on the Hotel Inspector with Alex Polizzi back in July this year after taking on the management of the hotel.</p>
      <p>They admitted the hotel didn't have the best reputation and that they had no experience of running such an establishment.</p>
      <p>The couple, who moved to Devon from Bristol two years ago, also revealed they had been learning how to make beds and lay tables using Google.</p>
      <p>Forte Hotel guru Alex worked with the couple on their room presentation, staff training and profit margins.</p>
      <p>She also focused on the curbside image of the property, which is renowned for its garish paint job - described by Polizzi as looking like "the content of a baby's nappy".</p>
      <p>A fresh lick of paint, repairs to the front stairs and a refurb of the reception area were all overseen by the programme.</p>
