      <p>PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. -- We have new details on a story we have been following closely in Charlotte County. Deputies say they've identified a suspect involved in what was initially thought to be an attack at Ollie's Pond Park, but he is not facing charges.</p>
      <p>Deputies say while they were investigating an attack in the area last Thursday, they were alerted about <a href="https://www.fox4now.com/news/local-news/second-woman-who-encountered-park-attacker-is-located">this other incident two-to-three weeks prior</a> . They say the man in that case will not be charged, and that case was not an attack.</p>
      <p>They describe it as a suspicious encounter, but say it was not criminal.</p>
      <p>Investigators are still searching for the suspect who <a href="https://www.fox4now.com/news/local-news/suspect-wearing-ski-mask-attacks-runner-at-charlotte-county-park">attacked a woman while she was jogging in the park</a> last week.</p>
