      <h1>Pep Guardiola's Anfield antics further proof the FA are weak with Premier League's top bosses</h1>
      <h2>Both Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp must set better example of how to treat to match officials with respect</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>The top men at Manchester City, it seems, are not too pleased with football’s authorities at the moment.</p>
      <p>They are a bit annoyed Bernardo Silva has been banned for a match and are still not best pleased with the officiating last Sunday, both on the pitch at Anfield and at the VAR headquarters near Heathrow.</p>
      <p>There is even a suggestion they have fired off a letter of complaint.</p>
      <p>They should be firing off a letter of thanks.</p>
      <p>In particular, thanking the Football Association and referees for giving Pep Guardiola an easy time.</p>

      <p>Brilliant coach, brilliant guy, very nice man - let’s hope he stays in the Premier League for a long, long time.</p>
      <p>He has produced a team that is better to watch than any other in my lifetime.</p>
      <p>But boy, is he indulged?</p>
      <p>The template was set back in January of 2018 when Guardiola marched onto the field post-match to confront Lee Mason after the referee had failed to send off Cardiff City’s Joe Bennett for an admittedly heinous foul on Leroy Sane.</p>
      <p>But no matter how serious the grievance, jabbing a finger towards the referee should be unacceptable.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Yet he got off with that one scot-free, even though, a couple of months earlier, he had been ‘reminded of his responsibilities’ after bizarrely accosting Southampton’s Nathan Redmond on the pitch after a Premier League game at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>In fact, it was not until January of this year that Guardiola had his first warning in English domestic football.</p>
      <p>During a predictably frantic game against Liverpool, he theatrically threw his scarf to the ground and shouted angrily at fourth official Martin Atkinson.</p>
      <p>But no more angrily than the manner in which he berated Mike Dean on the touchline at Anfield five days ago.</p>
      <p>That went unpunished, as did his deeply sarcastic gratitude to Michael Oliver after the final whistle.</p>

      <p>Is it now okay for all managers to do that?</p>
      <p>When Jose Mourinho saluted officials as ‘unbelievable’ and ‘fantastic’ after his Chelsea team were beaten by Sunderland in 2014, he was fined £10,000 for improper conduct.</p>
      <p>If Guardiola’s behaviour during and after the 3-1 defeat to Liverpool was not improper conduct, it is hard to know what is.</p>
      <p>It has to be stressed Guardiola is not the only manager who gets an easy ride from the powers-that-be.</p>
      <p>His number one adversary gets away with giving the fourth official as hard a time as any manager out there.</p>

      <p>At least Jurgen Klopp was fined eight grand after running onto the pitch when Divock Origi scored the late winner in a Merseyside derby a year ago.</p>
      <p>But Klopp continues to rant and rave on the touchline, having given Jon Moss a particularly vitriolic going-over in last month’s draw at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>We all know the presence of the fourth official is an invitation for dissent. It is almost as though that is what he is there for.</p>
      <p>And as well as their coaching brilliance, the unbridled passion Guardiola and Klopp bring to the Premier League is wonderful.</p>
      <p>But, across the professional board, the level of respect for the officials is not improving and that is filtering through all tiers of the game.</p>
      <p>No wonder the amateur game is struggling to find referees.</p>
      <p>Maybe it is because they manage, quite superbly, the two most thrilling teams in the English game that Guardiola and Klopp appear to be indulged.</p>
      <p>Plus, the VAR debate has been a distraction from the scale of dissent towards officials.</p>
      <p>It remains unacceptable.</p>
      <p>And it is down to the likes of Guardiola - and, indeed, Klopp - to set a better example.</p>
