      <h1>True profit surges on one-off gains</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:19:19+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#josephwaring" target="_blank">Joseph Waring</a></address>
      <p>True Group booked a sharp increase in net profit for the third quarter on one-off items and pointed to the mobile sector as the growth driver, despite falling ARPU.</p>
      <p>Net profit jumped to THB2.88 billion ($95.2 million), compared with THB99 million in Q3 2018, due to an <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/true-offloads-512m-in-infrastructure-assets/">asset sale</a> to the Digital Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund and a one-off impairment charge. Excluding the non-recurring items, the company incurred a loss of THB500 million in the period.</p>
      <p>Consolidated service revenue rose 1 per cent year-on-year to THB26.6 billion, as gains in mobile were mostly offset by a double-digit decline in its IPTV business and flat fixed broadband revenue.</p>
      <p><b>Mobile strength</b><br/>Continued subscriber growth with higher mobile data revenue fuelled a 2.1 per cent increase in service revenue to THB19.3 billion. Product sales more than doubled to THB7.4 billion.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the operator said market competition on the post-paid side was quite stable as it focused on pre- to post-paid migration and pricing optimisation, while acknowledging the prepaid market remains challenging with rivals offering competitive unlimited and big volume plans to attract customers.</p>
      <p>To improve growth, True said it plans to introduce customised offers to better match consumersâ€™ preferences and usage in each segment, while adding value through more popular content and pre- to post-paid upgrades.</p>
      <p>Its subscriber base increased 4.5 per cent to 30.1 million, on the back of 9.4 per cent growth in post-paid to 8.1 million customers. Prepaid ARPU slipped 1.7 per cent to THB117, while post-paid ARPU was down 1.3 per cent to THB468.</p>
