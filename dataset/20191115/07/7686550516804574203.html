      <p>Terrifying footage has shown just how quickly a catalytic converter can be stolen.</p>

      <p>One of the men slides underneath the car and cuts the converter from the pipes before taking off in a silver Renault.</p>
      <p>Catalytic converters are used to clean up harmful gases in a car's exhaust system.</p>
      <p>Thieves target the devices for the precious metals inside the converter, including platinum, palladium and rhodium.</p>

      <p>Palladium is currently worth around £1,347 per ounce, while rhodium is worth £4,463 per ounce.</p>
      <p>The theft happened at Clifton Park and Ride on Clifton Lane, Nottingham at around 2:30pm on August 6.</p>
      <p>Police are now urging drivers to protect their vehicles from catalytic converter thieves, by taking these precautions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you can, park your vehicle in a locked garage when it is unattended.</li>
        <li>If it’s not possible to garage your vehicle, park it in a busy, well-lit area as close to your property as possible.</li>
        <li>Consider installing a Thatcham approved alarm to your vehicle. Ones that activate if your vehicle is lifted or tilted are particularly effective.</li>
        <li>Use a catalytic converter protection device or marking system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Drivers will know if their catalytic converter has been stolen, as the engine will sound different.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on the theft should call 101, quoting incident number 470 of 6 August 2019.</p>
