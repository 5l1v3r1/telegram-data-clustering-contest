      <p>The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the Enforcement Directorate's plea challenging the Delhi High Court order granting bail to Karnataka Congress leader D K Shivakumar in a money laundering case. <br/><br/>A bench comprising Justices R F Nariman and S Ravindra Bhat rejected the request of the Solicitor General, appearing for the Enforcement Directorate (ED), to issue a notice to the other side on the appeal. <br/><br/>The Delhi High Court had on October 23 granted bail to Shivakumar. <br/><br/>The former minister was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in the alleged money laundering case. He was lodged in Tihar Jail till October 24. <br/><br/>Shivakumar had arrived here on October 26 to a rousing welcome from his supporters and party workers.</p>
