      <h1>Notts woman left 'baffled' after spotting crystals in Morrisons cheese</h1>
      <h2>It happens when cheese does not reach full maturation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:37:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:37</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>A woman has described her concern after finding 'lactate crystals' embedded in cheese slices she bought from Morrisons.</p>
      <p>This has been confirmed to be completely harmless and is caused when cheese "has not quite reached the end of its maturation process".</p>
      <p>Alex Beavis of Colwick said she was "completely baffled" to see "small shards" within the slices after she and her housemate had already eaten a few.</p>
      <p>"They came in a pack of 10 but there were only two left when I went opened one on Tuesday night (November 12)," Alex said.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old added: "I saw something sticking in the slice of cheese, but then realised it was throughout.</p>
      <p>"It looked like small shards, and I thought it was horrific considering they're really meant for children."</p>

      <p>Alex bought the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/morrisons">Morrison's</a> 'Cheesy Slices' on Friday, November 8 at the Netherfield branch. Th packet had an expiry date of January 2020.</p>
      <p>As well as the opened slice, she checked another unopened piece of the cheese and saw the same issue.</p>
      <p>Alex contacted customer services through <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>, believing it to be a serious matter and was told it would be investigated.</p>
      <p>After Nottinghamshire Live contacted Morrisons to find out what the cause was behind the unusual defect, Alex was asked to send the product back to be tested.</p>

      <p>It was confirmed that 'lactate crystals' had formed which happens when cheese does not fully mature, which is not harmful to eat.</p>
      <p>Alex responded to the information by saying: "I still wouldn't want to eat it, because it had sharp edges.</p>
      <p>"And it might not be good for a small child to eat. You definitely wouldn't expect it in a soft, cheese slice.</p>
      <p>"I think a small warning on the packet would be helpful to stop any other concern in future especially if it's not bad for you."</p>
      <p>A Morrisons spokeswoman said: "We have tested the cheese.</p>
      <p>"These are lactate crystals which can occur when cheese has not quite reached the end of its maturation process."</p>
