      <p>Here is the opening statement from the Department of Labor:</p>
      <blockquote>In the week ending November 9, the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 225,000, an increase of 14,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 211,000. The 4-week moving average was 217,000, an increase of 1,750 from the previous week's unrevised average of 215,250. [<a href="https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf">See full report</a>]</blockquote>
      <p>Thursday morning's seasonally adjusted 225K new claims, up 14K from the previous week's 211K, was worse than the Investing.com forecast of 215K.</p>
      <p>Here is a close look at the data over the decade (with a callout for the past year), which gives a clearer sense of the overall trend in relation to the last recession.</p>

      <p>As we can see, there's a good bit of volatility in this indicator, which is why the 4-week moving average (the highlighted number) is a more useful number than the weekly data. Here is the complete data series.</p>

      <p>The headline Unemployment Insurance data is seasonally adjusted. What does the non-seasonally adjusted data look like? See the chart below, which clearly shows the extreme volatility of the non-adjusted data (the red dots). The 4-week MA gives an indication of the recurring pattern of seasonal change (note, for example, those regular January spikes).</p>

      <p>Because of the extreme volatility of the non-adjusted weekly data, we can add a 52-week moving average to give a better sense of the secular trends. The chart below also has a linear regression through the data. We can see that this metric continues to fall below the long-term trend stretching back to 1968.</p>

        <b>Annual Comparisons</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here is a calendar-year overlay since 2009 using the 4-week moving average. The purpose is to compare the annual slopes since the peak in the spring of 2009, near the end of the Great Recession.</p>
