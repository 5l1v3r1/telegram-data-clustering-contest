      <p><b>PERTH, Australia (AP)</b> - Australia's national carrier Qantas on Friday successfully completed a 19 ½-hour, nonstop flight from London to Sydney, which was used to run a series of tests to assess the effects of ultralong-haul flights on crew fatigue and passenger jetlag.</p>
      <p>The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner took off from London's Heathrow Airport on Thursday morning and touched down at Sydney Airport 45 minutes behind schedule at 12:30 p.m. Friday.</p>
      <p>The 17,800-kilometer (11,060-mile) journey was part of Project Sunrise - Qantas' goal to operate regular, nonstop commercial flights from Australia's east coast cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne to London and New York.</p>
      <p>Last month, Qantas completed the first nonstop flight from New York to Sydney, which took 19 hours and 16 minutes.</p>
      <p>Another New York to Sydney flight is expected next month to round out the project.</p>
      <p>There were 52 people - mostly Qantas employees - on board. They participated in various experiments, including using wearable technology devices to track sleep patterns, food and drink intake, lighting and physical movement.</p>
      <p>A final decision on whether the ultralong-haul flights will become a commercial reality is expected by the year's end, with the service potentially launching by 2022.</p>
      <p>It was the second time a commercial airline has flown the route. The first was in 1989, with a journey time of 20 hours and 9 minutes.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the flight, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline wants to improve comfort on long-haul flights.</p>
      <p>"We know that travelers want room to move on these direct flights, and the exercises we encouraged on the first research flight seemed to work really well," he said.</p>
      <p>"So, we're definitely looking to incorporate on-board stretching zones and even some simple modifications like overhead handles to encourage low impact exercises," he added.</p>
      <p>Joyce and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed the arrival of crew and passengers as the airline celebrates its centenary year.</p>
