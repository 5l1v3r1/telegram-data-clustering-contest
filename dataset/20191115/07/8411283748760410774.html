      <h1>CPT owes workers up to NT$300 million in salary</h1>

      <p>The ill-fated panel maker Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT) is believed to be owing about 2,000 of its employees nearly NT$300 million (US$9.82 million) in salary, as it seeks to sell its 4.5G and 6G LCD lines to raise funds to cover the payments, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>But there are no signs that the company could sell the two older-generation LCD fabs in the near future after it announced bankruptcy in September, said the sources.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the company still owes NT$160 million in electricity fees to Taipower, the sources added.</p>
      <p>Fellow LCD makers Innolux and HannStar Display reportedly have made assessment for possible acquisition of the plants, but no deals have been signed, according to sources familiar with the deal.</p>
      <p>Some CPT workers have urged the panel maker's parent company, the Tatung Group, to take up the responsibility to clear the underpayments. Tatung and its subsidiaries hold a 40% stake in CPT.</p>
