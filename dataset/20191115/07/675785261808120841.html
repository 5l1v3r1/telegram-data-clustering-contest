      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 'sends personal scout' to watch Man Utd transfer target Erling Haaland</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd are eyeing a transfer move for Erling Braut Haaland with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer stepping up their interest in the RB Salzburg striker</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:29:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:29</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly stepped up his interest in Erling Braut Haaland - by sending his most trusted scout to monitor the Norwegian.</p>
      <p>Haaland has emerged as one of Europe's hottest properties after his stunning goalscoring form for RB Salzburg so far this season.</p>
      <p>He has bagged 22 goals in just 16 games in all competitions to put top clubs on red-alert.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1378931/2019/11/15/exclusive-solskjaer-sends-most-trusted-scout-to-watch-erling-haaland/?source=shared-article">The Athletic</a> , Solskjaer has sent Simon Wells to specifically watch the teenager in Champions League action as the club ponder a move.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer is no stranger to Haaland having handed him his senior debut a Molde, where he scored three goals in Solskjaer's last five games in charge before departing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>But Wells has been charged with running the rule over Haaland with the club preparing to pursue a move for the forward.</p>

      <p>United are keen to bolster their attacking options after struggling for goals so far this season.</p>
      <p>Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez both departed for Inter Milan over the summer leaving United thin on the ground without replacements.</p>
      <p>They have been boosted by Anthony Martial's return from injury but will still look to address their forward line in January.</p>

      <p>Mario Mandzukic has been linked with a move as a short-term fix with Haaland unlikely to leave Salzburg until the summer.</p>
      <p>But United could face serious competition to land Haaland with the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and other European giants linked.</p>
      <p>He has already bagged seven Champions League goals during his breakthrough and could be keen to stay in the competition with a return for United currently looking unlikely.</p>
