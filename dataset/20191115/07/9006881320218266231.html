      <p>Ever since apps like<a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/sex-relationships/tinder-made-me-freeze-my-eggs/news-story/2b6f001532214532d5bbdfa52a4d04ce"> Tinder</a> took over, and rom-com worthy meet-cutes became an object of nostalgia, a hook up is never really further than a right swipe away. But if you’re <a href="https://www.whimn.com.au/love/intimacy/you-can-have-a-marriage-or-a-sex-life-not-both/news-story/689e8c181d74745f2dad0563010fbb81">looking for more between the sheets</a>, science may have the answer, and it starts with the letter ‘C’: commitment.</p>
      <p>According to new research,<a href="https://www.whimn.com.au/love/intimacy/3-millennial-women-on-how-alcohol-plays-a-part-in-their-sex-lives/news-story/8ccc4cc8e9405fed473c4372cb84f73c"> women have better sex</a> in committed relationships compared to hook ups. The study, published in <i>The Journal of Sex Research</i> surveyed 1,084 sexually active women between the ages of 18 and 71 about orgasms, sexual satisfaction and monogamy.</p>

      <p>The findings showed that women experienced greater sexual outcomes with a significant other than a one-night-stand. But there’s a catch – it comes down to attitude. The study found women who were more open-minded and up for short-term sex-scapades tended to experience similar satisfaction and the ability to orgasm, regardless of whether the sex was casual or not.</p>
      <p>“I became interested in this topic because female orgasm is very complex and can be affected by a wide array of factors including psychological, physiological, and environmental factors,” said study author <a href="https://valwongsomboon.weebly.com/"><i>Val Wongsomboon</i>.</a></p>

      <p>“It’s also well known that women tend to orgasm less often than men do, hence the word ‘orgasm gap.’ Many researchers have focused on orgasm gap between men and women. However, I realised there is also an orgasm gap among women themselves.”</p>
      <p>“Some women orgasm all or most of the time while some rarely or never do, and this is greatly affected by contexts. Therefore, I started examining the orgasm/sexual satisfaction gap among women as I hope it will help us better understand women’s sexual function and satisfaction as a whole.”</p>
      <p>So by all means, swipe right – just make sure you go in with the right attitude.</p>
