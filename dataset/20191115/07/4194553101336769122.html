      <h1>Gomez “first in &amp; first out of the dressing room after FT” as England fans boo LFC defender</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:07:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate chose to substitute on Joe Gomez in the final stages of England’s rout against Montenegro, and the young lad was booed by his own supporters.</p>
      <p>You see, the Liverpool defender had the audacity to get attacked by Raheem Sterling in the Three Lions’ camp, and the Man City winger was disciplined by Southgate by way of being dropped from the team.</p>
      <p>In fairness, since the booing of Gomez, Sterling has actually come out on social media to stand up for his team-mate, who he admits has been wronged by himself and then the England fans.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the England fans’ reaction, there has been a lot of reaction – some have been saying it’s outrageous, others saying it’s an over-reaction and, bizarrely, some even denying it was about Gomez.</p>
      <p>We made our feelings known on Twitter last night – and there was some good chat in the replies to our Tweet:</p>
      <blockquote>Liverpool fans boo Sterling and we're a disgrace.<br/>England fans boo Gomez, Liverpool fans moan, and now we're dramatic.<br/>One rule for them and another for us, isn't it?<br/>— Empire of the Kop (@empireofthekop) <a href="https://twitter.com/empireofthekop/status/1195102709948538880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>It was revealed shortly after that Southgate was confused as to why any fans would boo Gomez, and <a href="https://twitter.com/skykaveh/status/1195101885927186433?s=12">Sky Sports journalist Kaveh Solhekol reported</a> that the 22-year-old was “<b>first in and first out of the England dressing room after the final whistle</b>“.</p>
      <blockquote>Gareth Southgate says he doesn’t understand why anyone would boo Joe Gomez. Says Gomez has done nothing wrong. Will sit down and talk to Gomez to make sure he’s OK. Gomez first in and first out of the England dressing room after the final whistle<br/>— Kaveh Solhekol (@SkyKaveh) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkyKaveh/status/1195101885927186433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote>
