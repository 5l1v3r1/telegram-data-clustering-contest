      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks moved higher in early trading on Wall Street and headed for records on Friday after U.S. officials said they were making progress in the latest push for a trade agreement with China.</p>
      <p>The market has been sensitive to any developments on U.S.-China trade talks. Investors hope the world’s two biggest economies can make a deal before new and more damaging tariffs take effect next month.</p>
      <p>The latest signs of progress in trade talks put investors in a buying mood. Technology stocks were the biggest winners in the early going. Applied Materials surged 7.3% on solid earnings.</p>
      <p>Health care and industrial companies were also making strong gains. Biogen rose 1.5% and Caterpillar rose 1.3%.</p>
      <p>Bond prices fell and pushed yields higher, signaling that investors were shifting away from safe-play holdings. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.83% from 1.81% late Thursday.</p>
      <p>Real estate companies and utilities lagged the market.</p>
      <p>KEEPING SCORE: The S&amp;P 500 index rose 0.3% as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 82 points, or 0.3%, to 27,866. The Nasdaq rose 0.4%. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks rose 0.4%.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>Asian and European markets moved higher.</p>
      <p>SLOW AND STEADY: The S&amp;P 500 has set records and extended its winning streak despite days of listless trading this week. The index is on track for its sixth weekly gain. It closed at a record of 3,096.63 on Thursday and is on track to beat that.</p>
      <p>The Dow is on track for its fourth week of gains. It is poised to beat its record close of 27,783.59, which it set on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq could also potentially beat its record of 8,486.09, which it set on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>BUFFETT BUMP: Luxury retailer RH rose 5.4% and energy company Occidental Petroleum gained 3% after Warren Buffett’s company disclosed that it had picked up shares on both companies.</p>
      <p>BIG FISH: Amarin jumped 6.5% after a government advisory panel recommended broader use of its fish oil-based heart disease drug Vascepa. Financial analysts predict that broader use of the drug could translate into billions in sales.</p>
