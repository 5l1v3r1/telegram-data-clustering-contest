      <h1>Social media: Double-edged sword for LGBT+ Asia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:04:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:04</time> by <a rel="author">Oscar Lopez</a></address>
      <p>Technology has proved a mixed blessing for LGBT+ people in Asia, advocates said on Wednesday, opening opportunities to connect but fanning hate speech, death threats and attacks.</p>
      <p>Social media companies must do more to keep LGBT+ people safe online, human rights campaigners from across the region said at the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s annual Trust Conference in London.</p>
      <p>“We get death threats and online harassment all the time, which affects ... the mental health of our members,” said Rhadem Morados, a gay, Muslim filmmaker from Mindanao in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>“But we should also embrace the idea that there are more advantages than disadvantages,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
      <p>“We can... bring the message directly... to the fingertips of the people who need it.”</p>
      <p>The ‘LGBT Philippine Community’ Facebook page, for example, has more than 10,000 followers, while Morados said he often gets messages from fellow LGBT+ Muslims on Instagram and Twitter seeking advice.</p>
      <p>The increasing availability and affordability of smartphones and emergence of digital savvy has allowed many LGBT+ people to connect with others across the region, activists said.</p>
      <p>“Internet is really important now,” said Tushar Kanti Baidya, an LGBT+ activist based in Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>“(People) from very rural areas, they can also have (a smartphone) and they can get connected to each other... they can share their crisis.”</p>

      <p>Gay sex remains illegal in Bangladesh and LGBT+ people often face discrimination and violence in the conservative, Muslim-majority country.</p>
      <p>In 2016, two prominent campaigners in Bangladesh were murdered in an attack claimed by al Qaeda.</p>
      <p>One of them, Xulhaz Mannan, was the editor of the country’s first LGBT+ magazine, available in print and online.</p>
      <p>Baidya says that since the attack, activists have had to reduce their activities, while many have become reticent to publish any writings about LGBT+ issues online.</p>
      <p>Given the risks, technology companies should do more to crack down on hate speech and improve security for vulnerable people, campaigners said.</p>
      <p>The messages sent to activists are often graphic.</p>
      <p>Morados, from the Philippines, said he had once received a message saying: “Prepare yourself… you will be beheaded soon”.</p>
      <p>“The potential for harm is so terrible,” said Ryan Figueiredo, founder and executive director of Equal Asia Foundation, an LGBT+ innovations incubator.</p>
      <p>“(Tech) organizations constantly gloat about the potential of digital media to do good, but I feel there is very little done,” he said.</p>
      <p>Figueiredo cited recent church-sponsored advertisements on Facebook for conversion therapy, a widely discredited attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity through psychological or spiritual means.</p>
      <p>According to Figueiredo, even if conversion ads are taken down with speed, his organisation’s suicide helpline often sees a spike in calls.</p>
      <p>“Communities cannot unsee what they have already seen – and the trauma is deep,” Figueiredo said.</p>
      <p>“It creates so much trauma that it takes many, many years to repair the damage of even 24 hours of such a terrible ad campaign.”</p>
      <p>Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
