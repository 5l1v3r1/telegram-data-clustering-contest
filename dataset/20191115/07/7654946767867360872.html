      <h1>NFL must make an example out of Myles Garrett</h1>

      <p>Myles Garrett should not be allowed to play another snap this season.</p>
      <p>Garrett embarrassed his team, his sport, his league and most of all himself when he inexcusably ripped the helmet off Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph and hit <a href="https://thenypost.wordpress.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/?preview_id=14672046&amp;preview_nonce=78eaadee0d&amp;_thumbnail_id=14672086&amp;preview=true">him viciously over the head </a>and face with it.</p>
      <p>The NFL has to put its <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/nfl-players-legends-sound-off-on-myles-garrett-helmet-attack/">money where its mouth is</a> here — if it truly cares about player safety.</p>
      <p>Because Rudolph could have been concussed or blinded, and thank goodness he was neither.</p>
      <p>All hell broke loose at the end of the Browns’ 21-7 victory over the visiting Steelers, when the bad blood between the rivals spilled all over national television and Garrett and two other players were ejected.</p>
      <p>“Pretty cowardly,” Rudolph said afterward.</p>
      <p>The NFL, after all the black eyes it has endured, cannot afford to act cowardly now.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-after-helmet-swing-fiasco-i-lost-my-cool-its-on-me/">“I lost my cool,”</a> Garrett said.</p>
      <p>More than anything, he lost the respect of his NFL brethren.</p>
      <p>What began as an ugly brawl devolved into a shameful act that will stain Garrett for the rest of his career.</p>
      <p>Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield ironically enjoyed what may be his finest moment when he stood taller than he had ever stood when he called out his teammate. <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/baker-mayfield-tears-into-helmet-swinging-myles-garrett-inexcusable/">“It’s inexcusable,”</a> Mayfield said.</p>
      <p>Garrett will apologize to his teammates, if he hasn’t already, and it will fall on the deaf ears of teammates who had hoped to dig out of their hole and make a playoff run.</p>

      <p>Once upon a time, a Titans defensive lineman named Albert Haynesworth removed Cowboys center Andre Gurode’s helmet and stomped on his head while he was on the ground. It caused a gash near Gurode’s eye. Haynesworth was ejected and suspended five games without pay.</p>
      <p>The NFL now must stomp Myles Garrett out. Zero tolerance for this kind of lawlessness on Roger Goodell’s football field.</p>
