      <h1>Clark County to spend $505M on 2 new Career Technical Academies</h1>

      <p>The Clark County School District will spend $505 million on two new Career Technical Academies to relieve overcrowding in North Las Vegas and Henderson-area schools.</p>
      <p>The CCSD Board of Trustees approved Thursday the fourth revision to the district’s 2015 Capital Improvement Program, which lays out planning for facilities and maintenance.</p>
      <p>CTA’s have been immensely popular in Las Vegas since they were introduced in the mid-1990s, according to a presentation by Chief of Facilities David McKinnis and Director of Construction Management Jeff Wagner, with 22,000 applicants for 15,201 available seats in the 2019-20 school year. The magnet schools offer pathways in areas like engineering, medicine and hospitality.</p>
      <p>To free up the money for the CTA’s, the CIP recommended removing previously planned facilities additions at high schools and comprehensive high schools. A northeast CTA would open near Legacy High School, while a Henderson CTA would open near Liberty High School.</p>
      <p>The district is also budgeting an additional $20.5 million toward a new 600-seat school at Maryland Parkway and Oakey Boulevard, which will jointly house Global Community High School and a proposed secondary program — a decision which caused some controversy, as Trustee Danielle Ford said Global administrators were not warned that they may share the new space.</p>
      <p>Other facilities priorities for CCSD include modernizing and renovating existing schools using previously planned funds for elementary school classroom additions. Approximately $406 million of the available funds would be spent on electrical, HVAC and painting and carpet updates for the 290 schools that are over 20 years old.</p>
      <p>CCSD’s total capital improvement needs as determined by the 2015 CIP are $10.83 billion, with about $5.4 billion needed for modernization and replacement.</p>
