      <h1>Man fined for possessing shark jaws</h1>

      <p>A MAN has been fined $11,000 after he was found in possession of a set of white shark jaws.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old Landsdale man was found with the jaws after Police conducted a search of his home.</p>
      <p>They were then handed over to Fisheries officers for investigation.</p>
      <p>Joondalup Magistrates Court head scientists had determined the jaws were most likely from a female white shark estimated to have been about 4.7 metres in length.</p>
      <p>For possession of the jaws from a totally protected fish the man was fined $1,500.</p>
      <p>He was also issued an additional $5000 mandatory penalty and ordered to pay $4545 in costs.</p>
      <p>The court was told there was no evidence the man took the fish and that he had admitted to receiving the jaws from a friend who was a fisherman.</p>

      <p>Supervising Fisheries and Marine Officer Mark Kleeman said taking any of WA’s totally protected fish species would always be treated very seriously by compliance officers.</p>
      <p>“Species don’t make it to this list unless there’s a significant risk, including fish populations being threatened or endangered,” Mr Kleeman said.</p>
      <p>“White sharks have been protected throughout Australia for 20 years and remain listed as a vulnerable species.</p>
      <p>“Historically, white shark jaws have sometimes been kept as trophies in private residences. However, as a totally protected species, this practice is no longer permitted.</p>
      <p>“If a fisher accidentally catches a protected fish they must release it as quickly and carefully as possible to avoid harm to the fish.”</p>
      <p>Mr Kleeman urged fishers who spot anyone doing the wrong thing to report it to <a href="http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/About-Us/Contact-Us/Pages/Fish-watch.aspx">FishWatch</a>.</p>
      <p>“Please don’t get directly involved,” he said.</p>
      <p>“By reporting what you see, you will assist us in protecting WA’s fish resources for future generations and reports are treated with the strictest confidence.”</p>
