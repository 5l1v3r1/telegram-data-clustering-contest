      <p>It may only be November but the festive season is approaching fast.</p>
      <p>You might have already heard the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">occasional Christmas song</a> on the radio or from a very enthusiatic work collegue.</p>
      <p>Heart Extra has also been playing nothing but Christmas songs 24/7, wasting no time with news and presenters, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/most-hated-christmas-songs-ranked-20878955">reports the Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>After taking to the airwaves a full 54 days before Santa visits, there's going to a fair bit of repetition in the build up to the most wonderful time of the year.</p>
      <p>As we begin to hear the same soundtracks everywhere we go, Brits have had their say on their most hated Christmas songs they'll be hoping to avoid.</p>

      <p>Surprisingly, Mariah Carey's Christmas classic 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' topped the poll to take the unfortunate crown of being the most annoying.</p>
      <p>The top three was made up of runner-up 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' from Band Aid and Wizzard's 'I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday' in the poll of 2,000 people in a survey conducted by HUAWEI to celebrate the launch of their new FreeBuds 3 headphones.</p>
