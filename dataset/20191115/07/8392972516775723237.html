      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> were left mind blown by Mel Owen's shock death in last night (November 14 2019).</p>
      <p>In Tuesday night's episode of the BBC soap (November 12 2019), viewers were left wondering what happened to Mel as she got into a car accident during a car chase with Sharon Mitchell.</p>
      <p>During the chase, Mel went straight into the back of another car, leading the car to flip over as a shocked Sharon looked on.</p>

      <p>On Thursday night, Sharon desperately tried to get Mel out of the car after spotting it was on fire and about to explode.</p>
      <p>While Sharon was trying to help, Mel kept 'hearing' her deceased son Hunter calling her name.</p>
      <p>Once Sharon managed to pull Mel from the wreckage, the car exploded.</p>
      <p>Although it looked like everyone had survived, Mel told Sharon when she was in the car she could hear and see Hunter.</p>

      <p>Sharon tried to convince the businesswoman that her mind was playing tricks on her, but Mel was adamant about Hunter being in the car and began walking back to the wreckage.</p>
      <p>As she walked back, she went straight into the path of an oncoming lorry.</p>
      <p>A short while later, viewers saw Mel's body being covered and Albert Square residents were informed that Mel had died.</p>
