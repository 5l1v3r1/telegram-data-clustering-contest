      <h1>McDonald's breakfast hours to be extended in every single restaurant next week</h1>
      <h2>Students and hungover people rejoice, you will soon be able to pick up a McMuffin a lot later into the the day after a successful trial led McDonald's to raise the cut-off time for its breakfast menu</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:39:59+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:39</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year McDonald's decided to see what would happen if it <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mcdonalds-extending-breakfast-hours-115-18782404">extended the breakfast hours at some of its restaurants</a> .</p>
      <p>Instead of rotating the menu boards on the dot of 10:30, cutting hungry and hungover customers off from hash browns, McMuffins and pancakes, it would let them keep ordering until 11am.</p>
      <p>And - in fantastic news for fans of breakfasts wraps with hash browns in them - the company has now said it will roll out the trial everywhere.</p>
      <p>Michelle Graham-Clare, McDonald’s UK cice president food &amp; marketing, said: "We all understand the pain of missing out on a McMuffin by a matter of minutes.</p>
      <p>"We have listened to our customers’ pleas and are delighted to extend breakfast serving time until 11am, particularly as we head into the festive season when we see a rush of latecomers searching for those all-important hash browns."</p>

      <p>The new system kicks off on 20 November, 2019 - that's Wednesday next week.</p>
      <p>And if you're thinking of ordering from home, the extra 30 minutes means you have until 10:45am to order through Uber Eats.</p>
      <p>Of course, it also means that if you're a fan of a breakfast double-cheeseburger and fries, you'll also have to wait an extra half-hour.</p>
