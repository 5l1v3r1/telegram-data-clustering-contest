      <h3>"We've really got... more games than we know what to do with."</h3>
      <p>“This is just the tip of the iceberg for us,” <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/matt-booty/">Matt Booty</a>, head of <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/xbox-game-studios/">Xbox Game Studios</a>, said at X019 this morning.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to show you some amazing things today, but before the end of the year we will show you even more games,” Booty said in an address to media. “Then, as we go into 2020, I think you will see one of the most exciting lineups that we’ve had coming from Xbox Game Studios in as long as I can remember.</p>
      <p>“I really want you to be on the look out for the games that we’re going to be announcing heading into that stretch,” Booty continued. “It’s really exciting and really for the first time ever we’ve really got in a way more games than we know what to do with in terms of when they’re going to be announced, so feeling really good about that.”</p>
      <p>Stay tuned from more from X019.</p>
