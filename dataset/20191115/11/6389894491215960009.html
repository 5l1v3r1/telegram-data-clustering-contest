      <p>The role of chief executive will not be replaced under the new structure, and group wide functions will be led by Mark Morris, chief financial officer and executive director. </p>
      <p>White’s departure comes after she lead a restructuring that brought Interserve back from the brink. </p>

      <p>“This new operating structure will provide us with increased focus in the right areas and ensure that we are well placed to continue this work. </p>
      <p>“By recognising the diversity of the three business divisions and giving each one the right governance and operating framework it will enable them to deliver sustainable growth in the distinct markets they serve.”</p>
