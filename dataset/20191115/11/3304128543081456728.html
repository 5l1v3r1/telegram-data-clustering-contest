      <p>While narrating the experience, Kalekye stated that she was at a point where she had lost appetite for food and could not feed on anything.</p>
      <p>She added that the art of eating should not be underrated as so many people lose their lives daily and the hospital program messed up her routine.</p>
      <p>“Yaani kuzoea kuamushwa mapema hosi can mess you up waaa… found myself chomoaing my hand freely ¨chukueni damu yenu,¨ she wrote.</p>
