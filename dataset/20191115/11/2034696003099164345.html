        <b>"Wonderwall is a love song. It’s about a girl”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The man behind some of<a href="http://nme.com/artists/oasis"> Oasis</a>‘ most iconic record covers has revealed that he planned to feature <a href="http://nme.com/artists/liam-gallagher">Liam Gallagher</a> on the cover of ‘Wonderwall’, before Noel blocked the idea.</p>
      <p>Michael Spencer Jones, who shot the cover to 1994’s ‘Definitely Maybe’, recalled how he and Liam were heading to London’s Primrose Hill to shoot the ‘Wonderwall’ artwork when a black cab “came to a screeching halt by us.”</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/noel-gallagher-blocked-liam-being-20884876">The Mirror</a> that Noel then got out of the vehicle and explained that Liam would not appear on the cover because “Wonderwall is a love song. It’s about a girl.”</p>
      <p>In the end, a female employee from Creation Records then appeared on the artwork to the 1995 single.</p>

      <p>He also recalled shooting the cover to 1997’s ‘Be Here Now’, which descended into “chaos,” hampering his plans to shoot the sleeve at night time.</p>
      <p>“The shoot descended into absolute chaos by night-time. The band were totally smashed. A generator blew up and the film was under-exposed,” Michael revealed.</p>
      <p>“In the end, we went with an image I’d done earlier in the day.”</p>
      <p>Michael’s photos are set to go on display at London’s h club from November 22 to January 12.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Liam kicked off his <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-liam-gallagher-play-gas-panic-bonehead-tour-hits-cardiff-2567008">latest UK arena tour in Cardiff earlier this week</a>. As well as performing ‘Gas Panic’ with former Oasis guitarist Bonehead, the show saw Liam playing a host of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/oasis">Oasis</a> songs including ‘Acquiesce’, ‘Supersonic’ and ‘Roll With It’.</p>
      <p>Yesterday saw Noel release new single ‘Wandering Star’, his<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-release-uplifting-new-single-wandering-star-listen-now-2567826"> latest effort with the High Flying Birds. </a></p>
