      <p>MBOMBELA – Elandshoek residents protested again from 17:30 to about 22:50 last night, according to TRAC spokesman, Solange Soares.</p>
      <p>The protests were sparked by the death of a community member, Thomas Sibanyoni (42), in police custody after he was detained by police following a domestic dispute.</p>
      <p>Angry residents blamed the police for Sibanyoni’s death and blockaded the road on Wednesday for about five hours.</p>
