      <p>There any many tell tale signs Christmas is on the horizon.</p>
      <p>One of them is Starbucks releases its festive drinks menu and another is Will Ferrell's Elf comes on the telly.</p>
      <p>Now you have the chance to bring these two Christmas delights together, with a secret festive drink nicknamed the Buddy the Elf frappuccino.</p>
      <p>But if you want to try the Buddy the Elf frap you can't just outright ask for it.</p>
      <p>Website <a href="https://totallythebomb.com/buddy-the-elf-frappuccino-at-starbucks">Totally The Bomb</a> claims you have to ask for a particular drink with specific extras to get the desired look.</p>
      <p>You need to ask for a Matcha Frappuccino, specifically with peppermint syrup instead of the normal one it comes with.</p>
      <p>The request it be topped with whipped cream and red and white Christmas sprinkles.</p>
      <p>The resulting drink has beautiful festive colours, and has a striking resemblance to Buddy the Elf.</p>
