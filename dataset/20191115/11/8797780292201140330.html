      <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was released last month, and has unsurprisingly sold a boatload of copies. According to NPD video game guy Mat Piscatella, Modern Warfare was the best-selling game in the US for October, and the year in general. It’s the 12<sup>th</sup> year in a row that Call of Duty has been the top-selling game in the month of its release, and that’s not likely to change. As a result, Call of Duty is the best-selling franchise in the US overall since tracking began.</p>
      <p>The incredibly well-received (but slightly underdone, in my opinion) Outer Worlds is the second best-selling game in the US for October. That, like with Call of Duty, includes both physical and digital sales. In number 3 comes the best-performing Switch game in the US last month, Luigi’s Mansion 3. That only includes physical sales though, so it’s possible it’d end up higher if digital sales were included.</p>

      <p>There’s not too much else surprising about the rest of the games that’ve sold well in the US last month. Madden is at fourth, because of course it is, while NBA 2K20 is in at fifth. Ubisoft’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint has done far worse than Wildlands did, but still managed to be the sixth best-selling game in the US for the month. And because fools and their money are easily parted, WWE 2K20 still managed to crack the top ten, followed by FIFA 20 and Borderlands 3. Ring Fit Adventure rounds out the top 10. Because the fitness game requires a peripheral, it’s only been available physically. Here’s the rest of the top 20:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</li>
        <li>The Outer Worlds</li>
        <li>Luigi’s Mansion 3*</li>
        <li>Madden NFL 20</li>
        <li>NBA 2K20</li>
        <li>Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Breakpoint</li>
        <li>WWE 2K20</li>
        <li>FIFA 20</li>
        <li>Borderlands 3</li>
        <li>Ring Fit Adventure</li>
        <li>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awaking*</li>
        <li>Mario Kart 8*</li>
        <li>Minecraft</li>
        <li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
        <li>Mortal Kombat 11</li>
        <li>Overwatch</li>
        <li>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*</li>
        <li>Code Vein</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption II</li>
        <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The games with the asterisks next to them have incomplete data, meaning that they represent physical sales only. If digital sales were included, they’d probably track higher.</p>
