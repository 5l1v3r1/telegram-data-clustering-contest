      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bafana Bafana</b> head coach <b>Molefi Ntseki </b>has insisted his team were not outplayed as they fell to a <b>2-0</b> defeat against <b>Ghana</b> in opening match of the <b>2021 African Cup of Nations</b> qualifiers.</p>
      <p>The Black Stars were by far the better side and ran out comfortable winners as goals from Thomas Partey and Mohammed Kudus settled the contest at the West Coast Stadium.</p>
      <p>It was Ntseki's first competitive match as head coach of Bafana after starting his tenure with a 2-1 win against Mali in a friendly last month.</p>
      <p>Ntseki told reporters after the game against Ghana: "I am still confident in my players even though we lost 2-0 and I feel the game was more balanced.</p>
      <p>"They (Ghana) had more power and strength in getting the goals.</p>
      <p>"It was not like we were outplayed in the situation where we conceded.</p>
      <p>"It happens in the game of football - when you are not balanced the opponent will take advantage."</p>
      <p>Ntseki also mentioned that although the hosts had more possession, the game was decided on fine margins.</p>
      <p>The Bafana continued: "When you are playing a game like this, everything is flowing very fast and you look for opportunities where you can hurt your opponent.</p>
      <p>"The two teams were very compact. If you look at Ghana, they didn't even have too many shots on goal, except from the goal from Thomas - and the second goal came from a transition, winning the ball when we were open at the back. They had possession but never hurt us."</p>
      <p>Bafana now face a crucial qualifier against Sudan at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 15:00.</p>
