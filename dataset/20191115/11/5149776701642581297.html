      <h2>Magpies defender is yet to make his debut</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:39:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:39</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>New signing Alex Lacey will have to wait to make his Notts County debut as boss Neal Ardley revealed he wants to minimise the risk of injury before drafting him into the squad.</p>
      <p>The centre-back signed on a free transfer last week in a deal that will last until the end of the season as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> moved to bolster their centre-back options to help cope with a demanding fixture list.</p>
      <p>But the former Gillingham and Luton defender is likely to sit out this weekend's game against Barrow as he continues to work on his fitness having been without a club since the summer.</p>
      <p>He is now set to figure in a friendly on Monday as he works towards his first appearance in a Notts shirt with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> keen not to rush him into action as a result of his lack of match practise.</p>

      <p>“He will be involved in a behind-closed-doors game on Monday, which is intended to top up the fitness of some players,” said Ardley.</p>
      <p>“He’s ready to come in if needed but we want to ensure the risk of injury is low.</p>
      <p>“We’re looking at the first week of December being that time for him, so we don’t want to bring Alex in too early and see him break down.”</p>
