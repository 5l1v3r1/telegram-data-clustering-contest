      <p>NEW YORK -- The New York state attorney general says one of the nation's biggest photo and video equipment retailers, Manhattan's B&amp;H, has failed to pay millions in sales taxes.</p>
      <p>According to a lawsuit filed Thursday by Attorney General Letitia James, B&amp;H Foto &amp; Electronics owes at least $7 million on reimbursements received from manufacturers as part of rebate discounts that benefited customers.</p>
      <p>The suit against the store was filed in state Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The attorney general's office seeks tens of millions of dollars in damages, interest and penalties.</p>
      <p>B&amp;H released a statement saying it's a New York institution that has operated for half a century "with a stellar reputation" and that the attorney general was wrong and "trying to create a tax on discounts in order to make New Yorkers pay more."</p>
