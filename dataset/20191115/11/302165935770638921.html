      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 15 — The retail price of RON97 petrol will go up by 13 sen to RM2.70 sen a litre for the fuel price week November 16-22.</p>
      <p>In a statement today, the Ministry of Finance said the retail prices of RON95 and diesel, however, will remain the same at RM2.08/litre and RM2.18/litre respectively.</p>
      <p>Based on the calculations under the Automatic Pricing Mechanism (APM), the retail prices of RON95 and diesel for that period should be RM2.26/litre and RM2.31/litre respectively, it said.</p>
      <p>“However, the retail prices for both fuels are maintained at RM2.08/litre and RM2.18/ litre in line with the government’s decision to stabilise petrol prices for petroleum products and reduce the cost of living,” it added.</p>
      <p>The statement said the cost incurred by the government to provide the subsidies for the fuel price week (November 16 to 22) amounted to RM120.58 million. ­— Bernama</p>
