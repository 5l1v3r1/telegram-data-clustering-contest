      <p>It would be really cool if you could send us Snaps the way we send you Snaps every day on Snapchat Discover, right? Well, guess what? Dreams come true, because <i>Cosmopolitan</i> just launched a second Discover channel full of Snaps directly from you.</p>
      <h3>Whoa, sick! Can I Snap you guys about literally anything?</h3>
      <p>Yes, kinda. We will always accept dog pics, but what we *really* want is for you to <b>Snap us videos (VIDEOS &gt; PICS, YOU GUYS!) </b>that respond to our specific daily themes. That’s right, each day we put out a call for Snaps on a certain subject—but don’t worry, they’ll always be fun.</p>

        <li><b>Capture your content. </b>Bling it out with doodles and Cosmo GIF stickers if you wish.</li>
        <li><b>Type #CosmoStories somewhere on your Snap</b>. It’s also helpful if you include a few words in your caption that explain what we’re looking at. Here’s an example: <a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitan.com%2Flifestyle%2Fa24106110%2Fcosmo-stories-snapchat-discover%2F&amp;description=Guys%2C%20You%20Know%20You%20Can%20Be%20Featured%20on%20Our%20Snapchat%20Channel%2C%20Right%3F-%20Cosmopolitan.com&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fhips.hearstapps.com%2Fhmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2Fdownload-1541805500.jpg%3Fcrop%3D1xw%3A1xh%3Bcenter%2Ctop%26resize%3D1600%3A%2A"/> Captions like “Why does my dog look like Dobby from Harry Potter right now? 😂” will help us find your Snaps. Mia Lardiere</li>
        <li><b>M</b><b>ake sure you submit your Snap to our Story.</b> Otherwise, we will never see it. 💔<br/><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitan.com%2Flifestyle%2Fa24106110%2Fcosmo-stories-snapchat-discover%2F&amp;description=Guys%2C%20You%20Know%20You%20Can%20Be%20Featured%20on%20Our%20Snapchat%20Channel%2C%20Right%3F-%20Cosmopolitan.com&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fhips.hearstapps.com%2Fhmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2Ffullsizerender-1540307081.jpeg%3Fcrop%3D1xw%3A1xh%3Bcenter%2Ctop%26resize%3D1600%3A%2A"/> THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!
