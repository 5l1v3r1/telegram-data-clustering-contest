      <p>The final week of Euro 2020 qualifying is already under way, with plenty still up for grabs. Places at next summer’s festival of football can be won or lost, while there are personal challenges ahead too.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency assesses what awaits the home nations.</p>
      <h3>Parting gift for O’Neill?</h3>
      <blockquote>We know Saturday is going to be a nice send-off for Michael with it possibly being his last home game. It's hard to take away the circumstances, it's hard to take away the atmosphere.<cite>Northern Ireland winger Niall McGinn</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Michael O’Neill’s eight-year stint as Northern Ireland boss has been nothing short of a revelation but is entering its final lap after he accepted the chance to take over at Stoke. With a more inviting group he would probably be sending his country to the European Championship for the second time in a row, but instead they face a monstrous double header against Holland and Germany and probably need to beat both to seal automatic qualification. Saturday’s home match against the Dutch, who came from behind to win the reverse fixture, is a chance to keep the dream alive for a little longer, tighten the grip on a play-off place at the least and for Windsor Park to show their manager the appreciation he has earned.</p>

      <h3>Raheem’s reintegration</h3>

      <p>What should have been an unequivocally celebratory week for England – marking their 1,000th men’s international and sealing top spot in Group A with a 7-0 mauling of Montenegro – has been complicated by the bust-up between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez. Gareth Southgate’s decision to ban Sterling from the occasion at Wembley dominated the build-up and the wholly unwarranted smattering of boos when Gomez came off the bench added further complication. Drawing a line under the matter in Kosovo on Sunday, with Sterling successfully returning to the XI and perhaps sharing the pitch with Gomez, would go a long way to closing the chapter.</p>
      <h3>Crunch time for Giggs and Wales</h3>

      <p>Scotland’s hopes of emerging from Group I have long since expired, with nine points from eight games leaving them well short of competitive. The Nations League has guaranteed a play-off place regardless, meaning Saturday’s trip to Cyprus offers a chance to build on the 6-0 win over San Marino last time out. Sadly for Steve Clarke he will be going in without the injured trio of captain Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay and Ryan Fraser, as well as Kieran Tierney. All are key players who Clarke will be leaning on in March but in their absence he will be desperate so see others take on the challenge.</p>
