      <p>Terrified Joanne Mason, 33, was terrorised by Luke Patrice, 32, for almost two years.</p>
      <p>She suffered unbearable abuse almost from the start of their relationship, reports the <a href="https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/domestic-violence-victim-tells-how-17256041">Examiner Live</a> .</p>
      <p>She said his possessive streak surfaced soon after they started dating in Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire, in December 2016 when he demanded her <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> password.</p>
      <p>After she caught Patrice with another woman he attacked her and then prevented her from getting medical treatment for four days.</p>

      <p>Traumatised Ms Mason has bravely spoken out about the abuse and her injuries - her eyesight will be "imperfect" for the rest of her life - after Patrice was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/justice">jailed</a>.</p>
      <p>She said: "He pretended to be me to see if I had any relationships with other men.</p>
      <p>"I thought he liked me. But he was a complete control freak.</p>
      <p>"I was supposed to have a court protection order in place to stop him from harming me but it didn't get sent off in time."</p>
      <p>Matters came to a head when she caught him with another woman in Golcar.</p>
      <p>Patrice left her with severe injuries in an attack on January 26, but she says he prevented her getting any medical treatment until four days later.</p>

      <p>He treated the wound himself with a frozen pack of ice at the home they shared in Scholes, near Cleckheaton.</p>
      <p>Ms Mason, who has a teenage daughter, said: "I had been looking forward to going out with some friends and had started to curl my hair.</p>
      <p>"He was going out too and couldn't find his trousers and flew into a rage. I went into the living room and lit a cig.</p>
      <p>"The next thing was he spat in my face and pushed me to the floor and called me a slag.</p>
      <p>"I went to run down the stairs and he smashed me in the face with the palm of his hand.</p>
      <p>"I was on the floor shouting at him: 'why do you have to hit me so hard?'"</p>
      <p>She went to Calderdale Royal Hospital and was referred to Bradford Royal Infirmary.</p>
      <p>Ms Mason said: "I phoned my mum. I needed to tell her because I was scared.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"On February 4 she underwent a three and a half hour operation to try to repair the optical nerve damage to her left eye with metal plates to hold her eyeball in situ.</p>
      <p>The mum said: "Luke was saying I didn't need it but I have been left with no feeling in the left hand side of my face. Quite a lot of my face is now numb.</p>
      <p>"The medics did a brilliant job but I've been left with a life-changing injury and my eyesight will be imperfect for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>"And I have post-traumatic stress disorder now.</p>
      <p>"I remember looking at the surgeon saying 'help me'. I had had enough.</p>
      <p>"Every time he used to hurt me he would say it was an accident.</p>
      <p>"I had never grown up with domestic violence, it was a new and horrifying experience for me. <br/>"I feel like my life has been torn apart. I was a happy, outgoing person.</p>
      <p>"My teenage daughter thinks what has happened to me is disgusting."</p>
      <p>She added: "I loved going out with my friends and spending time with my family. I was a happy person.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I loved my job working in the kitchen of a high school in West Yorkshire thought they had to send me home sometimes because of the damage he had done to me."</p>
      <p>Patrice went on the run earlier this year and West Yorkshire Police issued a plea for his whereabouts following allegations regarding a number of offences allegedly committed across the West Yorkshire area.</p>
      <p>Ms Mason said: "He was not man enough to hand himself in. He was bailed on 12 March. <br/>"He was in Leeds but was caught in Huddersfield."</p>
      <p>Yesterday at Leeds Crown Court, Patrice, of no fixed abode, was sentenced by Judge Robin Mairs to 34 months in prison.</p>
      <p>He was convicted of unlawfully wounding Miss Mason and received 24 months imprisonment. <br/>In addition he pleaded guilty to eight months for dangerous driving on Leeds Road and Lower Quarry Road, Huddersfield, in April 2018.</p>
      <p>He was also sentenced to two months for possession of Class B drugs in December 2017.</p>
      <p>Patrice received two months imprisonment for assaulting an emergency worker in Huddersfield He was also disqualified from driving for four years and five months.</p>
      <p>Asked how she felt about the length of his imprisonment she said it was not long enough.</p>
      <p>She said: "I feel heartbroken. How can someone who is meant to love you hurt you?</p>
      <p>"My daughter thinks what he has done is disgusting and all my family are upset.</p>
      <p>"I have had the absolute s*** kicked out of me. All I did was love him.</p>
      <p>It's not the physical abuse, it's the mental abuse.</p>
      <p>"He is a kind of Jekyll and Hyde character."</p>
