      <h1>Bafana Player Ratings Vs Ghana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:31:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>It was a display that was far from being easy on the eye as Bafana Bafana went down 2-0 to Ghana in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification opener on Thursday night, and the Siya crew has rated each performances individually.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ronwen Williams 3/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>His vision was blocked by his teammates for Thomas Partey’s opening goal in the first half and the second from Mohammed Kudus was an absolute belter. But even then, Williams didn’t appear commanding enough. Bad night at the office.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thulani Hlatshwayo 3/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>The back four just couldn’t contain Ghana, who had a total of 13 shots at goal, managing to use their power and strength to dominate. ‘Tyson’ was bullied by Jordan Ayew most of the night.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Buhle Mkhwanazi 3/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stood in the way of keeper Williams, giving him no chance to make the save for the first goal. Was caught on the backfoot for the second by Kudus when Bafana were trying to push for the equaliser later on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thami Mkhize 2/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Very average display, a shadow of his decent Afcon display back in June. Had André Ayew turn him inside out pretty much the entire game.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Sifiso Hlanti 3/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Very rarely went forward to get in those quality crosses to give Bafana strikers a sniff at goal. Had trouble dealing with Ghana’s switch of play between the Ayew brothers, Emmanuel Boateng and Kudus when he came on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thato Mokeke 2/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Very much a passenger throughout the match having returned to the international level since 2014 and may need to be gradually reintroduced if he is going to be a regular for Bafana.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dean Furman 3/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>With Zungu leaving the pitch after just 30 minutes, the game plan in midfield was disrupted and Bafana, including Furman, never found their rhythm.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bongani Zungu </b>
      </p>
      <p>Injury affected rating after he was subbed some half an hour into the game.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Thembinkosi Lorch 3/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>A shadow of the player that won the Footballer of the Season award earlier this year. Seems to be lacking confidence, though in Ghana he was apparently Bafana’s best player.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Percy Tau 2/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was a clear game plan to not give him the freedom he so often enjoys to run at defenders. Kept on the pitch as a goal threat, but did not offer it this time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bradley Grobler 2/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps deserved to start given his form in the domestic league and the fact that Lebo Mothiba did not feature in the friendly against Mali last month. But Grobler did not do much.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Subs:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thapelo Morena 2/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>A surprise choice to replace the injured Zungu, but perhaps not the best option that early in the game. Drifted between being a wide player, a central midfielder and at times alongside Grobler. Confusing.</p>
      <p><b>Kermit Erasmus</b> (not on the pitch long enough for a rating)</p>
      <p><b>Lebo Mothiba</b> (not on the pitch long enough for a rating)</p>
      <p>
