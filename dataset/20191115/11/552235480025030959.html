      <p>Scottish <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/">MMA</a> star Chris Bungard faces a new challenge at Bellator London after original opponent Mario Saeed was forced to withdraw from their fight due to injury.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b></i> can exclusively reveal that the ‘The Bad Guy’ now meets Switzerland’s Benjamin ‘El Skeletto’ Brander in a lightweight bout at Wembley's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sse">SSE</a> Arena on Saturday 23rd November.</p>
      <p>Brander, 32, fights out of 360 Martial Arts in Zurich and holds a professional record of 11 wins from 17 bouts.  After making his professional debut in 2012, he established a six-fight winning streak and will be looking to return to those levels of consistency as he enters the cage for the first time in 19 months against the popular Scottish Hit Squad man.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> born Bungard said: “I’m disappointed that the Mario fight is off as there was a lot of interest in that fight from the fans. But he has a wee sore rib apparently, so we move on.</p>

      <p>“It is never ideal having a change of opponent a week or so before the fight but everyone knows I’m the type of guy to fight anyone, anytime and anywhere.   I have put a lot of work into this camp, especially with my nutrition, so the main thing for me is that I still get to fight.</p>
      <p>“Benjamin has stepped up on short notice to make his Bellator debut, so I expect him to try an impress under the big lights.</p>
      <p> “We have watched his fights and he is a good striker with some nice submission wins too. I believe he will be a tougher test than Mario as he is good in all areas, whereas Mario was more grappling based.</p>
      <p>“But my objective was to go back to London and get the win, and that has not changed even though my opponent has. I will give everything I have in this fight, like I always do, to give the fans the exciting and dominant performance that they deserve”.</p>
