      <h1>Region's draft budget proposing property tax increase of over four per cent</h1>
      <h2>The 2020 projection is more than double the rate of inflation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:15:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author">Phi Doan</a></address>
      <p>Regional Council had a chance to review the budget draft for 2020 this week, with a number of follow-up meetings planned for further discussion.</p>
      <p>Strikingly, the budget draft proposes 2.58 per cent potential tax increase for region services, and 1.77 per cent for policing; for a total of 4.53 per cent property tax increase. This is more than double the rate of inflation, and higher than previous years---which usually averages less than three per cent.</p>
      <p>The 4.53 per cent tax increase would roughly translate to $90 for the average household in Waterloo Region. </p>
      <p>Regional Councillor Sean Strickland, Budget Committee Chair, also recognizes how "unusual" next year's proposed tax increase is. However, he explains the region is facing "significant budget pressure" in terms of transit and ambulance program expansions, paying development charges, and dealing with the opioid crisis among other things.</p>
      <p>"There is some room for switching things around, but not a lot of room. Each successive budget cycle becomes more and more clear that the demands place on local governments for services far outstrip our abilities to raise revenue to pay for them."</p>
      <p>"Income tax and the taxing powers the federal/provincial government are way more flexible and way more generous than property tax is. So it's a challenge to pay for all these increased services, accommodative inflationary pressures on your budget, when you have to rely on property taxes which is fairly static."</p>
      <p>Strickland says he knows from past budgets that the community won't accept a four per cent tax increase and is confident they can "bring in a tax increase that less than the one that's proposed currently."</p>
      <p>Another initiative Waterloo Region is running is their service review. They will be examining other municipalities to compare programs and services to see whether the region is overspending.</p>
      <p>The regional councillor is advising citizens to sign up online at <a href="https://www.engagewr.ca/">EngageWR</a> to give their input. People can also attend Regional Council on November 26 and December 11 to further discuss the budget draft. Final budget day is set for January 22, 2020.<br/> </p>
