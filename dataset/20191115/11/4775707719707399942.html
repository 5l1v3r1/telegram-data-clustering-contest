      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sam+Quirke">Sam Quirke</a>, 15 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>While the more exciting X019 news for Kingdom Hearts fans was that fact that <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39721/the-kingdom-hearts-back-catalogue-is-coming-to-xbox-next-year">Kingdom Hearts 1.5, 2.5 and 2.8 are coming to Xbox next year</a>, Shinji Hashimoto had one other bit of news related to the series. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Kingdom-Hearts-3/achievements">Kingdom Hearts III</a> finally has a demo version available on the Microsoft Store.

        <b>KINGDOM HEARTS ? DEMO Version</b>
      </p>
      <p>The demo of the KINGDOM HEARTS 3. The demo contains two stories: one from the game's opening sequence to the introduction of Olympus, and one that covers the first half of the Toy Box adventure. The save data of the former can be transferred to the full version of the game.</p>

      <p>Kingdom Hearts can be a daunting proposition for new players – although on the surface it's a game blending the cuter aspects of Final Fantasy with the cuter aspects of classic Disney characters, it's also a dark and surreal concept full of dense lore. Nothing characterises this better than the fact that both the first and second games were re-released on PlayStation as ".5" iterations, due to the fact that many spin-offs were baked into the canon. Even 2.5 couldn't contain all of the story beats, with 2.8 acting as a HD remaster of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance and also including some new content to plug some other narrative gaps.</p>
      <p>With all of that said, it's probably a good idea for new players to actually check that they like the game in terms of its pacing and gameplay, so despite being the third game in the series this Kingdom Hearts III demo might be a good place to start. According to the store description, the Kingdom Hearts III demo contains two distinct gameplay sections. One story starts from the game's opening sequence and follows through to the introduction of Olympus, while another covers the first half of the Toy Box adventure – an iconic moment for Kingdom Hearts, as this marks the first introduction of characters from Pixar's Toy Story series. Because the Toy Box adventure happens part way through the game players will not be able to carry their progression in this sequence over to the main game. However if demo players like what they play and decide to buy, they will find that their progress up to Olympus can carry over to a full purchase.</p>
      <p>Kingdom Hearts III was the first game in the series to come to Xbox platforms, and its announcement marked a flurry of new collaborations between Xbox and third parties traditionally locked to PC and PlayStation – as we saw again last night with the arrival of <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39715/yakuza-xbox-game-pass-release-date">The Yakuza Series on Xbox One</a> and the fact that <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39720/final-fantasy-xbox-game-pass">ten Final Fantasy games are coming to Xbox Game Pass for console and PC</a>. Phil Spencer is even committing to bringing the trickiest of those games over, asserting a personal goal to deliver <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39726/final-fantasy-14-xiv-xbox-one">Final Fantasy 14 on Xbox One</a>. Bringing the rest of the Kingdom Hearts series over to Xbox One would certainly make sense for our audience – reviews have been highly favourable, with a community average score of 4.35 from over 750 votes.</p>
      <p>Though Shinji Hashimoto expressed lots of excitement about the idea of bringing Kingdom Hearts 1.5, 2.5 and 2.8 to Xbox One, he wasn't able to confirm a date. We just know that the full Kingdom Hearts series so far should be available on Xbox One at some point in 2020.</p>
