      <p>There are crowdfunding platforms out there like <b>Kickstarter</b> and <b>Crowdfund</b> which are doing a good job helping many nonprofit organisations to start up on their own. These platforms have made donations and fundraising easier to access online and organisations have gained reputation through them as well. <b>Facebook</b> has now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964872/facebook-fundraising-instagram-live-stream-gaming-donation-sticker-stories-button">added</a> some of the new features for donations and fundraising across its platforms.</p>
      <p>There are three new features for Facebook which are a <b>donation button for Instagram</b>, <b>fundraising stickers on Facebook</b>, and <b>Charity Live Streaming Tools for Facebook Gaming Creators</b>. These features will come useful when organisations want to gain funds on these widely-used social media platforms.</p>

      <p>Instagram's new donate button</p>
      <p>The donation button for Instagram will be added into Instagram profile and you can locate it next to the contact button. This is said to be the change that would generate the most donations among these three new features. </p>
      <p>Instagram used to allow users to add ‘donation stickers’ in their Stories, but the Stories will disappear after 24 hours so it is not that effective for users who want to do a long term fundraising campaign. The ‘donation stickers’ will now be coming to Facebook as well. </p>

      <p>Screenshot of how Charity Live Streaming Tools work.</p>
      <p>Another update is to provide a wider rollout of fundraising for gaming live streams on Facebook. The Charity Live Streaming Tools will allow gaming creators to set a donation goal to raise funds from their fans. They are also able to choose from a list of charities available in their regions to start fundraising events.</p>
      <p>These features have made donations easier for both fundraisers and users across Facebook’s various platforms. There is also proof that can show these features are working well as 25 gaming creators have raised more than 180,000 USD (~RM747,090) for charity last year in the US while live streaming. With more of these features rolling out, raising funds for good causes would be fast and easy to access.</p>
