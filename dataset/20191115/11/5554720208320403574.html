      <h1>Heartbreak for Mayank Agarwal as he departs at 243 even after Virat Kohli’s ‘instruction’ to score 300</h1>

      <p>India’s Mayank Agarwal played a brilliant knock of 243 on the second day of the first Test against Bangladesh at Indore. Agarwal’s second career double-century came with a huge six off the bowling of Mehidy Hasan. But what caught everyone’s attention soon after Agarwal completed the second double century of his career was an extraordinary sign by captain Virat Kohli, who displayed three fingers to indicate that he wanted him to score a triple century. In response, Agarwal gave a ‘thumbs up’ sign to acknowledge his captain’s instruction.</p>

      <p>This appeared to push Agarwal to go for big shots in quick succession as he began to hit Bangladeshi bowlers around the ground. This also proved to be his undoing as he ended up giving a catch to Abu Jayed at the boundary off Hasan’s bowling.</p>
      <p>Agarwal’s knock of 243 included 28 boundaries and 8 sixes. Agarwal was dropped when he was batting at 32. Interestingly, Kohli had asked him to go for a double-century when Agarwal crossed 150. Once again, he had replied with a ‘thumbs up’ sign.</p>

      <p>Chesteshwar Pujara made 54, while Ajinkya Rahane was unlucky to not have completed his century as he departed for 86.</p>
      <p>At the end of the second day’s play, India were comfortably placed at 493/6 with Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav batting at 60 and 25 respectively. Yadav took just 10 balls to score his 25 that included three sixes. Saha was bowled out by Ebadot Hossain for 12.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh were <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/sports/indian-bowlers-shine-in-first-test-against-bangladesh-as-michael-vaughan-courts-controversy-with-comments-on-indore-pitch/272527/">all out for 150</a> in their first innings.</p>
      <p>India scored 410 for the loss of five wickets on the second day of the first Test. This was their third-highest single-day total against any team. In 2009-10, India had scored 443/1 on day 2 against Sri Lanka in Mumbai. The same year, they scored 417/2 on day 1 against Sri Lanka in Kanpur.</p>
