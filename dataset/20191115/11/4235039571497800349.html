      <p>The World Health Organization has announced a scheme to reduce the "overly <b>expensive</b>" <b>price</b> of <b>insulin</b>, BNR reported, citing the BBC. The <b>UN</b> agency wants pharmaceutical companies to produce generic versions of the <b>insulin</b> that it will then test.</p>
      <p>Since its discovery in 1923, in America, the <b>price</b> of <b>insulin</b> has risen from $ 1 per vial to about $ 300.</p>
      <p>About 20 million people are suffering from type 1 <b>diabetes</b> and need regular <b>insulin</b> injections in order to live a normal life, according to WHO. 54 million people globally have type 2 <b>diabetes</b> and use <b>insulin</b> only in critical cases.</p>
      <p>Once the generic version passes the safety tests, it will be introduced to the global market at a lower <b>price</b>, driving down the <b>price</b> of the drug.</p>
      <p>The WHO has successfully implemented similar schemes in the past, most notably antiretroviral drugs in 2001.</p>
