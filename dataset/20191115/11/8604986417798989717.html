      <p><b>Not finding a balance between quantity and quality. </b>The quantity of stories published every day is important for bringing in traffic--but so too is the <i>quality</i> of those stories. You don't want to just publish a bunch of aggregated stories or just a couple of really high-quality stories. Finding a balance is essential. A few years ago, Mental Floss received a mandate to publish 50 stories a day, which we did. I would argue that the quality of those stories was still high, because each one went through at least two rounds of editing, including fact checking. But we found that because we needed to get up that much content every day, we were featuring stories that perhaps weren't the most on-brand for us. (Also, it was exhausting!) Since then, we've scaled back, and have hopefully found a balance between the short, newsy stuff--which we always try to add a little something extra to, rather than simply aggregating--and the more in-depth stories we know our readers love: long reads, big questions, strange history, informative lists, etc.</p>
      <p><b>Not knowing what your brand is.</b> It seems like a bit of a "duh" thing, but knowing what your brand is, and who your audience is and what they enjoy, is key to a website's success. Whenever we're assessing a story, we ask ourselves: Will someone feel smarter after reading this, and walk away knowing something they didn't know before? Is it a story they'll want to share with someone else? Does it help tell our readers more about the world they live in? Is it a little quirky, and does it make us feel good? Not every story we run will check all of these boxes, but each one will check most, and that's how we know it's "Flossy." (Occasionally there's a story where we can't articulate <i>why</i> it's Flossy but we just know that it is--it has that little <i>je ne sais quoi</i> that makes it a Mental Floss story.) We say no to a ton of stories that just don't feel quite like us even though they might get clicks, because protecting our brand is important.</p>
      <p><b>Not paying writers for stories. </b>Writers deserve to be paid--it's as simple as that. And chances are, the quality of the stories you're getting will be better if you're actually paying for them. The economics of digital media make it hard to pay print rates (after all, if you're publishing 20 stories a day, it's hard to pay $1 a word), but it's important to pay something.</p>
      <p><b>Publishing stories without editing them first.</b> Every single story that goes up on Mental Floss has at least two pairs of eyes on it. Why do we do this? For one, to catch typos and confirm the facts. For another, so that we can address any questions or red flags that might not have occurred to an editor who has spent hours staring at the story. Editing is important--don't skip it!</p>
      <p><b>Not being transparent with sourcing, and not checking facts.</b> Readers deserve to know where information is coming from, so hyperlinking is a must. So is fact checking--it's impossible to be perfect, obviously, but getting things wrong erodes reader trust. Fact checking is time consuming but necessary, even if you don't have a dedicated person devoted to doing it.</p>
      <p><b>Using photos without permission</b>. I cannot stress this enough: It is a bad idea to take photos from just anywhere! There are lawyers out there who spend all of their time tracking down client photos that are being used without permission and filing lawsuits. It's worth paying for a subscription to photo services like iStock or Getty. And if you want to use an image from a photographer you've seen on Instagram, reach out for permission--and save that permission email in a file! This even extends to tweets: A <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/federal-judge-says-embedding-tweet-can-be-copyright-infringement">recent ruling</a> said that embedding a tweet with a photo in it can be considered copyright infringement. So again, if you want to use a photo, reach out for permission!</p>
      <p><b>Not promoting the content you create. </b>Too often, newcomers to the digital media world take a sort of "if you build it, they will come" approach to promoting their site(s) and content--when, in fact, that is definitely <i>not</i> the case. If you're spending the time to cultivate a brand and loyal readership and working with talented writers to tell unique stories, you owe it to yourself (and those readers and writers) to share the work that you're doing. Having a social media presence is essential--as is spending time to build that presence. Mental Floss is fortunate in that our longevity has helped us to grow a large social media following, but we never stop looking for new readers to introduce to our content. Not just by sharing our stories via our own social media pages (which other people will share, which brings us new readers) but by working with like-minded partners to share each other's content. Atlas Obscura is a great example of a brand partner; we work with their site on a weekly basis to share stories that we believe our readers will enjoy, and they do the same. Our staff of editors and writers are also a great source of sharing stories via their personal social media sites. One of the great things about working for Mental Floss is the pride we all feel in the content we create--we all work to share it with as wide an audience as possible</p>
