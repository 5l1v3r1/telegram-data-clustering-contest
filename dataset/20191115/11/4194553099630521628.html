      <h1>Joe Gomez ‘incredibly low and confused’ after being booed by England fans – report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:46:42+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, Liverpool defender Joe Gomez was booed onto the field by England fans as he replaced Chelsea starlet Mason Mount on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>It’s now been revealed that some of the players believe Gomez was even being booed while warming up, before he was brought on with 20 minutes to go.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/15/joe-gomez-left-devastated-wembley-boos-gareth-southgate-seeks/">As reported by the Telegraph</a>, Gomez is said to feel ‘<b>incredibly low and confused</b>‘ after being booed by the England fans.</p>
      <p>The same report also claims that Gareth Southgate has since reached out to Gomez and his family to offer his support – and to reiterate his previous vote of confidence.</p>
      <p>It goes on to say that the England team actually want both Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez to start the next game together to show that the spat is quashed.</p>
      <p>We’ve made our feelings known on social media very clear, about this issue, so we’re not going to go off on one now, but here’s a couple Tweets that sum it up:</p>
      <blockquote>It's not Gomez's fault if one of England's best players acted like a tw*t and got himself dropped from the team.<br/>That's on Sterling – and tbf to the lad he's now owned up to it, and doesn't agree with the treatment of Joe.<br/>Sort yourselves out.<br/>— Empire of the Kop (@empireofthekop) <a href="https://twitter.com/empireofthekop/status/1195238439727353857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>It’s a messy situation that hasn’t been handled very well, but it seems everything is in order now. Let’s just hope Gomez isn’t affected by all of this too much. Would love him to start England’s next game and put in a 10/10 shift.</p>
