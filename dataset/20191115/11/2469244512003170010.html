      <p>A Conservative who won back a council seat from the Liberal Democrats in a Devon by-election said voter support for prime minister Boris Johnson helped her to victory.</p>
      <p>Jane Barnby’s comments followed her success in the by-election in the Goodrington with Roselands ward for Torbay Council.</p>
      <p>Cllr Barnby, a long-serving councillor who lost her seat at the local elections in May, said she felt she had benefited from a large personal vote, as she had lived in the area for 32 years and worked locally as a physiotherapist, knew a lot of people and was involved in community projects.</p>
      <p>She added that she noticed at the count that many voters in the Roselands area appeared to have switched support from the Liberal Democrats to the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>She said she felt was that there was much more support from local people for prime minister Mr Johnson than his predecessor Theresa May, who was in office at the May elections.</p>
      <p>Cllr Barnby said her campaign had also benefited from better organisation than in May.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s beyond belief. I’m excited and incredibly honoured.”</p>

      <p>She added that the weather had affected turnout, as older people especially were refusing to go out to vote in the cold and dark.  </p>
      <p>Cllr Barnby lost her seat at the local elections in May when she was pushed into third place by Liberal Democrat Rick Heyse. His resignation for personal reasons triggered the by-election.</p>
      <p>The other councillor elected in the ward at Paignton in May was Liberal Democrat Lee Howgate, his party's General Election candidate.</p>
      <p>Cllr Barnby won the by-election with 892 votes, 251 ahead of Liberal Democrat Dennis Shearman.</p>
      <p>Edward Davis for the Brexit Party was in third place, ahead of Labour’s Catherine Fritz and Jane Hughes of the Green Party.</p>

      <p>The Conservatives are seeing a result as a boost to the prospects of Kevin Foster retaining the seat in Parliament at the General Election in December.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats are pointing to the low turn of around one in four voters, and say it cannot be read as an indicator of voting intentions next month because General Election turnout is traditionally much higher.</p>
      <p>The voter turnout of 28 per cent at the by-election was lower than the 38 per cent in May. The General Election turnout in Torbay in 2017 was 67 per cent.</p>
      <p>Mr Foster, a Government minister who has held the seat since 2015, said: "This is a great result for Jane who will be a strong voice for local residents. </p>
      <p>“The result is also a sign of how residents are backing the Conservative Team in Paignton and our work on local issues such as regenerating the town centre. </p>
      <p>“It is also a massive blow to the Lib Dem leadership of Torbay Council and the ‘Independent’ councillors propping up their administration."</p>

      <p>Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate Mr Howgate said the by-election result was disappointing but pointed to the low turnout which showed people were reluctant to vote in a winter election.</p>
      <p>He said the May result had been an outstanding achievement when the Liberal Democrats took both seats from the Tories for the first time in 16 years. </p>
      <p>He said people on the doorstep told him they supported the programme of the Liberal Democrat and Independent leadership running the council, including its plan to regenerate the rundown Crossways shopping centre in Paignton. </p>
      <p>Mr Howgate added that people voted differently in General Elections than local elections, so the outcome was not a reliable indicator of voter intentions next month.</p>
      <p>He said: “We know that by-election success does not always transfer to national election success.”</p>

      <p>The council’s Conservative group leader Dave Thomas said it was a fantastic result and he was delighted to welcome back an experienced councillor.</p>
      <p>He said: “Jane lost her seat in May by 40 votes, so it is really sweet she was returned with a majority of 250 votes last night.” </p>
      <p>The Goodrington with Roselands ward with around 6,500 voters covers the area between the A3022 Brixham Road and the beaches at Goodrington, and includes Paignton Zoo.</p>
      <p>The local election in May resulted in a partnership of Independents and Liberal Democrats taking control of the council. The opposition Conservative group is the biggest on the council but does not have an overall majority.</p>
