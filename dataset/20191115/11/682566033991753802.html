      <p>Cape Town - Football fanatics will be overjoyed at the news that the <b>South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)</b> has confirmed Sunday's <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)</b> qualifier between <b>Bafana Bafana</b> and <b>Sudan</b> will be televised.</p>
      <p>South Africans were left unable to watch Bafana's Thursday AFCON qualifier in Ghana after neither <b>SuperSport </b>nor the <b>SABC</b> screened the match.</p>
      <p>Thomas Partey and Kudus Mohammed netted a goal each as Ghana secured maximum points in a <b><a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/BafanaBafana/bafana-soundly-beaten-by-impressive-ghana-in-afcon-qualifier-20191114">2-0 win</a></b> over South Africa at the Cape Coast Sports Stadium.</p>
      <p>Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki will be hoping to bounce back when South Africa face Sudan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the northeast African nation will be in good spirits after they ran out 4-0 winners over Sao Tome and Principe earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>Bafana are expected to depart Ghana on Friday morning as they shift their focus to Sunday's crucial clash at the Orlando Stadium.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at <b>15:00</b> and screened live on <b>SABC 1</b>.</p>
