      <p>There's a lot of games to get through in two days, especially with what Friday has thrown up.</p>
      <p>Chances are you've probably grabbed <i>Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield</i> or <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i> already, the latter of which unlocked at midnight on PS4 and went live earlier this morning on PC (unless you're playing on Steam, in which case it's this afternoon). But there's also a bunch of other games that have gone live today too: <i>Legends of Runeterra</i>, the <i>League of Legends</i> card game, is back with another test.</p>

      <p>I haven't finished <i>Death Stranding</i> yet, although I'm slowly working my way through that in between work and sickness, so that's a mission and a half. I honestly can't wait for that game on PC - it's the sort of second-screen experience that reminds me a lot of how I enjoyed <i>The Old Republic</i>.</p>
      <p>What are you playing this weekend?</p>
