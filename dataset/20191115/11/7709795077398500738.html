        <b>Top jockey Daryl Jacob reflects on Fusil Raffles' Wincanton win while looking ahead to his potential rides at Cheltenham this weekend.</b>

      <h3>Fusil Raffles will come on a bundle</h3>
      <p>I was delighted with Fusil Raffles at Wincanton in the Unibet Elite Hurdle last weekend.</p>
      <p>I know a lot of people were crabbing his performance afterwards but I don’t know how you can, really, as it was only his third run over the sticks in England and Ireland.</p>
      <p>It was his first run back of the year, too, racing against a hardened type from Paul Nicholls’, and you’ve got to remember Grand Sancy is a very good horse, he beat Sceau Royal in the Kingwell Hurdle last year, so I know how good he is.</p>
      <p>For my horse to beat him first time out, knowing that he’d need the run as much as he did, I was very impressed with him and I know he’ll come on bundles for the run.</p>
      <p>To get that first run out of the way is always difficult, but for him to win like he did, I was delighted.</p>
      <p>I’d say the Christmas Hurdle is a strong possibility for his next start. Obviously he won the Adonis around Kempton last year so it’s the obvious race and we’ll go there with high hopes.</p>

      <h3>Top Notch effort at Aintree</h3>
      <p>He’s an unbelievable horse and it goes to show why the public like him so much because he’s all heart, it looked like he’d get swallowed going down to the last and it was a never-say-die effort from him, head down, he battled on great.</p>
      <p>It was good to see him win on his first start of the year like that as he would’ve needed the run as well, so to do that and beat the quality horses he beat was encouraging.</p>
      <p>We’ve a couple of options with him, he won the Peterborough Chase at Taunton a few years ago when it was rescheduled, so he could go to Huntingdon for that race, or another hurdle race is another possibility as well.</p>
      <h3>Wholestone back at beloved Cheltenham</h3>
      <p>There's obviously been a lot of rain at Cheltenham with Friday's card abandoned, but Wholestone won’t mind the rain at all, the softer ground doesn’t bother him, but I am just a bit worried about the combination of the trip and the ground.</p>
      <p>I think he nearly got outstayed over three miles at Cheltenham last time, so I personally wish it was two and a half in these heavy conditions.</p>
      <p>He’s got the course form, though, he’s good around there, so hopefully he’ll go there with every chance.</p>
      <p>We take on Mulcahys Hill again and get an 8lb swing at the weights, which will help, but Warren Greatrex’s horse will likely come on for the runs last time, too, so it’s all set up to be a good rematch.</p>

      <h3>Rain pain for Sceau Royal</h3>
      <p>The rain wasn’t ideal for him ahead of the Shloer Chase.</p>
      <p>It’s a shame as I schooled him on Thursday morning and he seems in really good form, but lots of rain meant he wasn't declared for Cheltenham Sunday.</p>
      <p>Hopefully he'll get his ground somewhere soon.</p>
      <h3>Heading to Cork</h3>
      <p>With no Sceau Royal running on Sunday I'm heading to Cork to ride Texard in the Children Under 14 Race For Free Maiden Hurdle.</p>
      <p>He makes his debut for us and Gordon Elliott but he looked a nice prospect in France and we'll learn more about him on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The reports from Gordon's are good and he's got a Grade One entry in the Royal Bond, so hopefully he can make a good start to his career for us.</p>
      <p>It's usually a warm race and Willie Mullins has a good record in it having won it with some good horses, but we go there with high hopes.</p>
      <h3>Bristol in great nick ahead of Betfair</h3>
      <p>Bristol De Mai’s in superb form ahead of his reappearance in just over a week’s time as he goes for another Betfair Chase at his beloved Haydock.</p>
      <p>I sat on him earlier in the week and he schooled really well and all this rain that we’re having is very much a positive for him as he just loves it.</p>
      <p>We’re delighted with him and there’ll be plenty more of chat about him in next week’s column!</p>
