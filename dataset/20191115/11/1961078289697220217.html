      <p>Free-market economists once talked about “the miracle of Chile,” praising its policies as Latin America’s great economic success story. But recently, over a million people have flipped the script, taking to the streets and facing down a violent police response as they demand a reckoning on the promise of prosperity that never came.</p>
      <p>Today, we explore how, in Chile, capitalism itself is now on trial.</p>

        <li>“It’s not 30 pesos, it’s 30 years.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/world/americas/chile-protests.html?smid=pc-thedaily">Our columnist went to Santiago</a>, the Chilean capital, to understand how a small hike in public transportation fares ignited mass protests.</li>
        <li>After weeks of demonstrations, Chile’s president said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/americas/chile-protests-new-constitution.html?smid=pc-thedaily">he would support a new Constitution</a>. But for many, it was too little, too late.</li>
