      <h2>The Toffees are said to be "lining up" a £12m move for Cash in January, when the transfer window opens for business</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:28:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">James Pallatt</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest fans have been reacting to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/matty-cash">Matty Cash</a> being a £12m target for Everton, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-player-ratings-season-3532587">been in good form</a> for the Reds so far this season, helping them challenge towards the top of the Championship under new head coach Sabri Lamouchi.</p>
      <p>And his performances at the City Ground are said to have attracted the attention of Everton, with the Toffees claimed to be "lining up" a £12m move for Cash in January, when the transfer window opens for business.</p>
      <p>The Sun say scouts for the Goodison Park club have watched Cash in action for Lamouchi's Reds this season and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/always-seen-nottingham-forest-ace-3533123">"like his versatility as a midfielder and full-back".</a></p>
      <p>Crystal Palace and Southampton are also said to be keeping tabs on Cash, who rose through Forest's academy into the first team.</p>
