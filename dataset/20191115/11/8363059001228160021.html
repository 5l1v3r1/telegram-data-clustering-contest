      <p>Simba is having its biggest ever sale starting tomorrow, with up to £524 off a handful of bundles on the website.</p>
      <p>If you're interesting in giving the <a href="https://simbasleep.com/">"World's Most 5 Star Reviewed Mattress Brand"</a> a whirl, then you can snap up one of three bundles that have had their prices slashed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hybrid Basics Bundle</b>: Up to 31 per cent off the Simba Hybrid Mattress and a Deluxe Mattress Protector</li>
        <li><b>Hybrid Pillow Bundle</b>: Up to 35 per cent off the Simba Hybrid Mattress, 2 height-adjustable Hybrid Pillows and a Deluxe Mattress Protector</li>
        <li><b>The Ultimate Simba Hybrid Bundle</b>: Up to 40 per cent off the Simba Hybrid Mattress, 2 height-adjustable Hybrid Pillows, a temperature-regulating Hybrid Duvet and a Deluxe Mattress Protector</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Hybrid mattress ranges from £449 to £749 based on their size, while the mattress protector is anywhere from £45 to £75. The pillows come in at £99 each, and the duvet will set you back between £99 and £199. So a discount of 31-40 per cent isn't to be sniffed at.</p>
      <p>The sale kicks off tomorrow at 9am and runs up until midnight on November 29, so there's plenty of time to mull over your sleeping needs and pick a bundle.</p>
