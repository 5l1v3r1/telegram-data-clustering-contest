      <p>The number of councillors who have failed to hand in their register of interests has ‘reduced dramatically.’</p>
      <p>Last month The Gazette reported that up to 13 councillors could face prosecution for not completing their register of interest.</p>
      <p>Section 34 of the Localism Act 2011 stated that it was an offence without reasonable excuse to fail to comply with the obligation to submit a register of interests. The register should be submitted within 28-days of a person being elected.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a Full Council meeting on Wednesday, November 6, Councillor Clive Eginton said: “I am pleased to say that following the monitoring officer having written to a number of parish councillors who had outstanding matters relating to the register of interests, the number has reduced dramatically.</p>
      <p>“We are heading in the right direction, but having said that, there are still several who are outstanding.” </p>
