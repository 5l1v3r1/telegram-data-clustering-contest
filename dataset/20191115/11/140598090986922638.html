      <h1>Don't call millennials like me 'workshy': we clock more hours than our parents because we're afraid of losing our jobs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:52:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/hugh-morris0/" target="_blank">Hugh Morris</a></address>
      <blockquote>Let's bust a few myths here: while millennials are stereotyped as lazy, avocado-toast-eating, vegan snowflakes, a new study has shown that, in fact, they are working longer hours than their parents and grandparents. Can it be that the inventors of flexi-working are not so workshy after all?</blockquote>
      <p>First things first: judging people by their generation is as ridiculous as defining them by the colour of their skin, height or shoe size. </p>
      <p>While millennials were all born within a specified bracket of dates (1981-1996, by most definitions), and have subsequently been subject to the same social and economic conditions growing up, that is where the similarities end. </p>
      <p>To wit: I was born slap bang in the Millennial middle and I can take or leave the avocado. </p>
      <p>I am also workshy which, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/14/truth-snowflake-millennials-actually-working/">according to the most recent research and contrary to popular opinion</a>, makes me an outlier among my conscientious peers. </p>
      <p>News this week from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that we namby-pamby, square-eyed snowflakes are working longer weeks than our elders; 37.4 hours a week compared to 37 hours for those aged between 30 and 49, and 36.9 for people in their fifties. </p>
      <p>Of course, this was news to those who hold oddly aggressive prejudices against Millennials. But for us, it was not, because we know we work longer. We know that we are never truly away from our desks and that the membrane between our life and work is so porous as to be non-existent. </p>
      <p>The rise of flexible working in a digital age for the first generation to grow up with such technology has been well documented as one of the cornerstones of the myth that millennials are lazy. If you’re not working the land all day, the argument goes, you’re not really working. </p>
      <p>But one of the most recent bees in the bonnets of older generations is the introduction of “unlimited holiday” or free-form working hours. It’s true that, on the face of it, the companies that allow their staff to make their own hours — and decide their own annual leave — are creating an office environment for indolent babies, an open prison viewed with envy from the Alcatraz of generations gone by. </p>
      <p>When I have spoken to my contemporaries who have experience of such workplaces, they say the opposite is true. Not having set hours means they work longer: they are never off the clock and, without a holiday allowance, they take less time off. </p>
      <p>Whether your office adopts this more modern approach or not, one of the key qualities of employment over the past decade or so is the idea that we workers are lucky to have a job at all, and that if we don’t want to work the hours set for the money offered, there’s a long line of people who will. The prevalence of imposter syndrome in our age group - the anxiety of believing you are not qualified for your position - drives an insecurity in millennials that forces them to cling to their work to a fault. Stockholm Syndrome, but with your boss.</p>
      <p>These fears aren’t unfounded: among our many labels, millennials have been called the “job-hopping generation”, as we’re three times more likely than our elders to have been in our positions for less than a year. There’s movement in the workforce and while this might imply opportunity, another way of looking at it is insecurity.</p>
      <p>These traits may change as we grow older but I think we soft, liberal snowflakes remain in the shadow of financial crisis. Many of us entered the job market in the immediate aftermath of one of the greatest economic calamities in history. Our parents raised us with a confidence of comfort and security from our semi-detached houses in the ‘burbs — “You can go out and do anything you want, son!” — but when our turn came, everything turned to arse. A perpetual dread of job insecurity has been the monkey on our back ever since.</p>
      <p>And so, chasing for our as-yet unborn children the lifestyle our parents were lucky to offer us, we work and we work hoping that one day we might feel like we belong. </p>
