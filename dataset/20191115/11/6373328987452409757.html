      <h1>Suicide Rates Fall After Same-Sex Marriage Legalised In Sweden And Denmark</h1>

        <b>The legalisation of same sex marriage led to significantly reduced suicide rates amongst LGBTQ+ individuals in Sweden and Denmark, according to a study.</b>

      <p>Suicide rates among those in same sex relationships dropped notably during two time periods, 2003 to 2016 and 1989 to 2002; partially attributed to the reduced stigmatisation of sexual minorities within these countries.</p>
      <p>However, despite this progress, researchers still reported a ‘worryingly high’ number of suicide death amongst LGBTQ+ individuals, who were found to be as twice as likely to die by suicide than their heterosexual counterparts.</p>

      <p>Both Sweden and Denmark are regarded to be progressive nations in terms of promoting LGBTQ+ rights with Denmark becoming the first country on earth to permit same-sex civil unions in 1989. Sweden followed in 1995.</p>
      <p>Sweden became one of the first countries to legalise gay marriage in 2009, with Denmark following closely behind in 2012.</p>
      <p>The study, published in the <i><a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2019/11/01/jech-2019-213009">Journal of Epidemiology and Health</a></i>, was conducted by the Danish Research Institute for Suicide Prevention and researchers from Stockholm University, who used data from national population registers.</p>
      <p>Researchers compared data from 1989 to 2002 and 2003 to 2016, and looked at suicides of those in same-sex couples at the time when civil partnerships were allowed, as well as when same-sex marriage was legalised.</p>

      <p>Deaths by suicide among those in same-sex partnerships fell by 46% during both time periods, compared to 28% amongst heterosexual couples.</p>
      <p>These figures have been partly attributed to better understanding of mental health issues, however researchers also believe same-sex marriage – and the subsequent reduced stigma – has made for a substantial contribution.</p>
      <p>
        <b>According to the study:</b>

      <blockquote>With the passage of time, legalisation of same-sex marriage and the expansion of rights and protections to same-sex couples, those minorities have become much more accepted in the Nordic countries and elsewhere.<br/><br/>This might have decreased the stigmatisation, psychological stress and level of distress experienced by sexual minority people, thereby reducing their suicide risk.</blockquote>

        <b>Annette Erlangsen, from the Danish Research Institute for Suicide Prevention, told <i><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nordics-lgbt-health-trfn/suicides-fall-with-gay-marriage-in-sweden-denmark-as-stigma-fades-idUSKBN1XO010">Reuters</a></i>:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Being married is protective against suicide.<br/><br/>[…] Legalizing same-sex marriage and other supportive legislative measures – they might actually reduce stigma around sexual minorities.</blockquote>
      <p>Sadly, despite this notable decrease, same-sex married people still died by suicide at over twice the rate of those in heterosexual couples during both time periods.</p>
      <p>Going forward, researchers have emphasised the ‘critical need for better understanding of suicide risk and protective factors in sexual minority populations’.</p>
      <p>These findings reportedly support existing research from other countries that indicate a higher incidence of suicide attempts among those from the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
