        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg's</a> time in Formula 1 is coming to an end but attention will turn to where he will race next season. German touring cars and IndyCar have all been rumoured and the current <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> driver is not ruling out the latter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hulkenberg is set to be replaced by Esteban Ocon at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> next season with the Frenchman teaming up with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a>. The only possible F1 seat left for Hulkenberg is at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> but that seems reserved for Nicholas Latifi.</p>
      <p>With his future yet to be decided the German driver is not ruling out a drive in IndyCar but just wants to see out his final F1 season strongly.</p>
