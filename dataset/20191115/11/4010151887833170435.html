      <h1>Not Getting Enough Sleep? You Aren't Alone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:00:27+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Preidt HealthDay Reporter</a></address>
      <p>FRIDAY, Nov. 15, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- More Americans are having trouble falling and staying asleep, and smartphones and technology are probably to blame, researchers report.</p>
      <p>Their analysis of data from nearly 165,000 adults nationwide showed that the number who reported difficulty falling asleep at least once a week was up 1.4% between 2013 and 2017, and those who had trouble staying asleep rose 2.7%.</p>
      <p>Those percentages may appear small, but it means that as many as 5 million more adults have sleep problems, according to study leader Zlatan Krizan, a professor of <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/guide-to-psychiatry-and-counseling">psychology</a> at Iowa State University (ISU), in Ames, Iowa.</p>
      <p>"How long we <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-disorders-faq">sleep</a> is important, but how well we <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm">sleep</a> and how we feel about our sleep is important in its own right," Krizan said in a university news release. "Sleep health is a multidimensional phenomenon, so examining all the aspects of sleep is crucial for future research."</p>
      <p>The study was published online recently in the journal <i>Sleep Health</i>.</p>
      <p>Krizan and his team could not say what's contributing to the increase in sleep problems, but technology is likely a factor, according to lead author Garrett Hisler. He's a former ISU graduate student who is now a postdoctoral associate at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>"We know from our previous research there is a correlation between smartphone use and insufficient sleep among teens," Hisler said in the news release.</p>
      <p>"If we're on our phone before bed or we're receiving alerts in the middle of the night, that can make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night," he explained.</p>
      <p>Too little sleep and poor sleep can increase the risk of <a href="https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/default.htm">heart disease</a>, and sleep quality affects overall well-being, the researchers noted.</p>
      <p>Krizan said, "We know that how well people sleep is generally very reflective of people's health and may be an indicator of other conditions. If we want a full picture of the population's health, it's important to measure and track these changes in sleep trends over time."</p>
