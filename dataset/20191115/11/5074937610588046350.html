      <h1>Nairobi summit commits to transforming the world for women and girls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:39:23+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:39</time> by <a rel="author">Christabel Addo, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Nairobi, Kenya, Nov. 15, GNA - The Nairobi Summit on International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25), ended on Thursday in the Kenyan capital, with partners making commitments to transform the world for women and girls.</p>
      <p>It said it would achieve this by ending all maternal deaths, unmet need for family planning and gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls by 3030.</p>
      <p>The over 9,500 delegates from 170 countries globally, took part in the radically inclusive conference, uniting behind the Nairobi Statement which establishes a shared agenda to complete the unfinished business of the ICPD Programme of Action, which centred around the "three Zeros" which are key obstacles impeding on the health and progress of women and girls globally.</p>
      <p>The delegates now leave Nairobi with a clear roadmap of actions to advance the ICPD agenda and transform the world for women and girls.</p>
      <p>There were 135 sessions, over 900 speakers, and had so far received more than 1,500 commitments including billions of dollars in pledges from public and private sectors partners.</p>
      <p>Dr Natalia Kamen, the Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), said the Nairobi Summit represented a renewed, re-energised vision and community working together to act and deliver on their promises.</p>
      <p>"Together, we will make the next years a decade of action and results for women and girls, keeping their rights and choices at the centre of everything we do," she said.</p>
      <p>It also raises the voices of marginalised communities, youth and grassroots advocates, who were able to directly engage Heads of States and policy makers about how to realise the rights and health of all people.</p>
      <p>Dr Kamen said the Summit which was co-hosted by the governments of Kenya and Denmark, with the UNFPA and the UN Agency for Sexual and Reproductive Health Agency, unveiled critical new data about the cost of achieving these goals.</p>
      <p>She thanked all who worked tirelessly to make the Summit a reality, and especially the co-host countries and institutions as well as the sponsors.</p>
      <p>Dr William Samoei Ruto, the Deputy President of Kenya, said the Summit was in a class of its own and a great success.</p>
      <p>He said societies have now been challenged to accelerate the progress made and sustain their willingness to advance the rights of women and children and other vulnerable groups.</p>
      <p>The Kenyan government, he said, commits to all the five thematic areas arrived at by consensus of the delegates, and the Sustainable Development Goals, which include ensuring poverty reduction, inequalities and maternal health.</p>
      <p>He said the Kenyan government was committed to accelerating progress and investment in targeted priority areas such as technical and vocational skills for the youth and partner with the private sector to deliver appropriate programmes and interventions.</p>
      <p>Dr Karen Elleman, a former Danish Minister and now an advocate of reproductive health, noted that the issue of Sexual and Representative Health Rights went beyond politics, to becoming human rights issue that had the tendency to jeopardise socio-economic growth of countries.</p>
      <p>She challenged all countries to work hard and faster to keep the promises made at the ICPD Cairo Summit in 1994.</p>
      <p>She expressed her contentment about the highly inclusive and participatory nature of all the sessions, saying the youth must be placed at the forefront of discussions "if we are to make a meaningful headway".</p>
      <p>She said the world had all it took to make the ICPD25 agenda a reality by empowering the youth and harnessing their enormous energies to achieve change.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Ib Peterson, Denmark's Special Envoy for ICPD25, said women and girls around the world have waited long enough to have rights and choices, and now look towards 2030 as a new decade of delivery of which "we will walk the talk" and hold everyone accountable for the commitments made at the Nairobi Summit.</p>
