      <h1>Gatchalian urges LGUs to help make PH more business friendly</h1>

      <h3>SENATOR Win Gatchalian says Local Government Units (LGUs) should embrace digital innovation in order to streamline the processing of business permit applications.</h3>
      <p>Valenzuela City recently launched “Paspas Permit” system, an online service which aims to process business permit applications in the city in just 10 seconds from the usual 15 to 30 minutes. It will spare applicants from the cost and time required of the usual personal application process.</p>
      <p>The online integrated permit application system provides a single platform for the application of permits and document requests. Applicants can now register an account, fill out the online application form, submit the requirements then make payments.</p>
      <p>Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez recognizes the system for being “the first of its kind” in the country especially with today’s easy access to smartphones and the internet.</p>
      <p>Gatchalian encourages other local government units to follow suit.</p>
      <p>“Malaking ginhawa ang matatamasa ng ating mga kababayan kung ang bawat lungsod at munisipyo ay ia-adopt ang digital technology sa pagkuha ng mga permits. Mas magiging efficient ang pagkuha ng permits at mas mapapadali ang pagtayo ng mga negosyo. Kapag maraming negosyo, magbubunga ito ng maraming trabaho para sa lahat,” Gatchalian said.</p>
      <p>The former Valenzuela mayor believes that replicating the “Paspas Permit” System of Valenzuela City in other cities and municipalities will make the Philippines more business-friendly to local and foreign investors.</p>
      <p>Gatchalian noted that while an “Ease of Doing Business” report places the Philippines in the 95th spot from 124th out of 190 economies in 2019, the country ranked below its East Asian peers.</p>
