      <h1>Wacker Starts Up New Silicon-Metal Production Facility in Norway</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:10:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author">Gerald Ondrey</a></address>
      <p>Wacker Chemie AG’s (Munich, Germany; <a href="http://www.wacker.com/">www.wacker.com</a>) new silicon-metal production plant officially went on stream at the Holla site in Norway today, following two and a half years of construction. The new furnace is one of the largest of its kind in the world and increases the Holla site’s total capacity by more than 40%. The silicon produced in Holla now covers about one third of the demand at Wacker’s German sites. A total of around €100 million was invested in the new plant. Its state-of- the-art design makes the facility particularly efficient, requiring little maintenance.</p>
      <p>“The silicon-metal capacity we’ve added at this production site is a key strategic step in our sourcing of raw materials,” says Rudolf Staudigl, president and CEO of Wacker Chemie AG, as he explains the reasons behind the investment decision. “Expansion of captive production makes us more independent of price fluctuations on raw-material markets and enhances our supply security, both during times of peak demand and whenever problems might arise in relation to mounting trade barriers worldwide,” he emphasizes.</p>
      <p>Wacker acquired the Holla site, close to the city of Trondheim, in 2010. It has been producing silicon metal there to meet its own needs ever since. Silicon metal is one of the most important raw materials. It is needed for producing silicones and hyperpure polysilicon. Wacker employs around 200 people in Holla.</p>
