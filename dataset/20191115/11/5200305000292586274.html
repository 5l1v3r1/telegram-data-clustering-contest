      <p>After a disaster of a ‘Mohenjo Daro’ (2016) there is a lot riding on the forthcoming movie ‘Panipat’ for director Ashutosh Gowariker. He is back in his comfort zone with magnum opus historic costume films with this one as they recreate the 18<sup>th</sup> century battle of Panipat as the Afghan King decides to evade India to shake up the Maratha rule. The film has an exciting star cast of Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Kapoor, Kriti Sanon, Padmini Kolhapure, Mohnish Bahl and Kunal Kapoor to name a few with the royal look of Dutt and Kapoor really suiting them well. Leaving his last film aside, Gowariker has always delivered stunning music in his films. For this one the legend of Javed Akhtar is back on the lyrics collaborating with the music duo Ajay Atul. He has had a great year going to Oscars with ‘Gully Boy’ (2019) and his work on this historic war film will be worth a listen while Ajay Atul are expected to deliver a grand album here.</p>
      <p>The first single <i>Mard Maratha</i> gives a good insight into the film with the video showcasing the grandeur of the production with its massive sets, costumes, colours and a massive number of artists.. some things that Gowariker always delivers well on. The video feature almost the entire Maratha cast in this song and it is almost a role setting song as one gets to see everyone as to where they fit in. A big line up of singers including Ajay Atul themselves with Sudesh Bhosle, Kunal Ganjawala, Swapnil Bandodkar, Padmanabh Gaikwad, Priyanka Barve deliver voices to the various actors in this song. No singer actually stands out being a community chorus song but they all do a decent job. The large orchestra uses a number of traditional Marathi instruments like lezim, manjeeras, dholki and big Maratha nagadas. The music is recorded to a modern touch which doesn’t give a lot of depth to the sound as it relies a lot on deep bass and trumpets for depth in the song. Nonetheless the music is well arranged with its highs and lows in a composition which sounds rather familiar. The lyrics are nicely put together as there is pride and a war cry in it while a stanza also breaks into romance then coming back to aggression and Maratha pride. Overall this first single has all the elements of what is expected from a big war cry song while staying true to its historic musical roots. The composition is just a little too common for liking and feels quite clichéd. <b>3.5/5</b></p>
