      <p>The show, which pits two strangers learning two parts of a romantic dance choreographed by Ashley Banjo, will be part of Channel 4's charity drive.</p>
      <aside>I loved the show and as it’s for such a good cause I decided to step out of my comfort zone and give it a go.</aside>
      <p>Coleen said: "Talking about my love life on TV is second nature to me but Flirty Dancing was a whole new ball game. I don’t think I’ve ever been so nervous.</p>
      <p>"But I loved the show and as it’s for such a good cause I decided to step out of my comfort zone and give it a go."</p>
      <p>Coleen's famous family have affected by the disease.</p>

      <p>Her dad Tommy and sister Bernie have both died from cancer, while sisters Anne and Linda have also battled the disease.</p>
      <p>"It’s no secret cancer has deeply affected our family so I am delighted to do anything I can to help raise money for Stand Up To Cancer," Coleen said.</p>
      <p>"The work being done is phenomenal."</p>
      <p>Coleen split from second husband Ray Fensome - the father of her 18-year-old daughter Ciara - in 2018.</p>
      <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/coleen-nolan-looking-for-a-friend-with-benefits/">she said that she's ready to date again</a> but doesn't want to marry again or even share her home with another man in the future.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Coleen - who also has sons Shane, 30, and 26-year-old Jake with first husband Shane Richie - told new! magazine: "I don't want to get married again. I just want to meet someone I can have a lovely relationship with.</p>
      <p>"I'd like it to be with someone who has his place and I have mine and when we want to see each other we do and when we don't, we don't. A friend with benefits."</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old star admitted she is "terrified" at the thought of going on a date.</p>
