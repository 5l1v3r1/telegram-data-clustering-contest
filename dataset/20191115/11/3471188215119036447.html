      <p>Amazon Australia has announced that they have officially enabled the local Skills so that Echo and Alexa powered speakers can control compatible <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Dyson-Limited/dp/B06WVN7SHC">Dyson</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/iRobot-Home/dp/B06Y3PSHQ3/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=roomba&amp;qid=1573854855&amp;s=digital-skills&amp;sr=1-1">iRobot Roomba</a> devices.</p>

      <p>At an event earlier this week in Sydney, Amazon demonstrated controlling settings on a Dyson fan and iRobot Roomba vacuum.</p>
      <p>To be able to do the same at your home, you need to enable the Alexa skills for<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Dyson-Limited/dp/B06WVN7SHC">Dyson</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/iRobot-Home/dp/B06Y3PSHQ3/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=roomba&amp;qid=1573854855&amp;s=digital-skills&amp;sr=1-1">iRobot Roomba</a> and set them up.</p>
      <p>Amazon Alexa is compatible with these Dyson connected machines: Pure Cool Link purifier fan, Pure Hot+Cool Link purifier fan heater and 360 Eye robot.</p>
      <p>Once connected youâ€™ll be able to say commands like these and many more:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alexa, ask Dyson to start purifying</li>
        <li>Alexa, ask Dyson to set speed to 3</li>
        <li>Alexa, ask Dyson to start vacuuming</li>
        <li>Alexa, ask Roomba to start vacuuming</li>
        <li>Alexa, ask Roomba to stop vacuuming</li>
        <li>Alexa, ask Roomba to go home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have an Alexa speaker and compatible Dyson or Roomba devices please let us know how the new voice integration works in the comment section.</p>
