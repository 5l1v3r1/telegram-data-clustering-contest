      <h3>SENATOR Leila de Lima has introduced a measure in the Senate seeking to ensure the safety and comfort of commuters whenever they ride in common carriers or Public Utility Vehicles (PUVs).</h3>
      <p>De Lima filed Senate Bill (SB) No. 1165, or the “Passenger Transit Rights Acts of 2019,” which seeks to establish clear standards for service for the riding public and provide relief against unprofessional and abusive drivers.</p>
      <p>“The traffic congestion is a mere fraction of the daily stressors our commuters encounter and struggle with whilst availing of the services of common carriers,” she said.</p>
      <p>“While uncomfortably seated in cramped public utility vehicles, the space – or the lack of it, becomes least of their concerns.  They clamor for comfort, but ultimately, they beg for safety,” she added.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court declared that common carriers are obliged “to transport its passengers to their destinations with the utmost diligence of a very cautious person.”</p>
