      <h1>La Liga plan to take Atletico Madrid vs Villarreal to Miami halted by court decision</h1>
      <h2>La Liga wanted to take the regular league fixture to the United States</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/La_Liga">La Liga</a>’s hopes of staging <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/villarreal">Villarreal</a>’s game with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/atletico-madrid">Atletico Madrid</a> on December 6 in Miami have ended after a local court declined a request to grant an injunction against the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF), who oppose playing the match abroad.</p>
      <p>The league’s organising body filed a complaint against the RFEF last year over the latter’s refusal to authorise playing regular season matches abroad, claiming the RFEF did not have the authority to block the move.</p>
      <p>That complaint will be heard next February.</p>
      <p>“Madrid’s Mercantile Court No. 12 today decided not to grant interim measures to stage an official La Liga match in Miami in a case about the pending authorisation from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF),” said a statement from La Liga.</p>
      <p>“La Liga respects this decision, which does not prejudge the substance of the matter, which will be permanently settled in February 2020. Staging an official match abroad is part of a long-term La Liga strategy for international growth.</p>
      <p>“We hope that from February La Liga will be able to organise an official match beyond Spanish borders.”</p>
      <p>This is the second time the league has been unsuccessful in its bid to play regular season matches abroad, after Barcelona withdrew from plans to play a league game last January against Girona in Miami, citing a lack of support.</p>
