      <p>The 45-year-old Ivorian artist took the pictures for her series <a href="https://www.joanachoumali.com/index.php/projects/photography/ca-va-aller">Ça Va Aller</a>, which means “It will be OK” three weeks after armed men attacked a beach resort in Grand Bassam, leaving at least 18 dead.</p>
      <p>The pictures shot with her iPhone depict reactions to the trauma of terror attacks. It portrayed a response to attacks on a sleepy beach resort in southern Ivory Coast in 2016.</p>

      <p>She said the 2016 attacks “reopened the mental wounds” of the country’s 2011 civil war, when fighting erupted after President Laurent Gbagbo failed to accept defeat in elections in 2010.</p>
      <p>Processing the pain of the tragedy through embroidery, she combines photographic imagery with fabric.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.joanachoumali.com/">Joana Choumali</a> actually prints the photographs on to canvas before embroidering stitches directly on to the surface. “Each stitch was a way to recover, to lay down the emotions, the loneliness, and mixed feelings I felt,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c77jz3mdmyvt/photography">she said</a>.</p>
