        <b>There’s a disturbance in the Force. Oh, wait no, it’s just that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is out and with it has come a flood of reviews. This is our opportunity to tell you what the critics are saying about EA’s latest addition to the Star Wars universe, and so far, it looks like the stars have aligned.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The reviews for Fallen Order have been particularly consistent, hovering around a solid eight mark. Our in-progress <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/review">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order review</a> by our very own Richard Scott-Jones praises the way the game reflects the language of the Star Wars franchise and fits right into the universe, while successfully slipping into some Metroidvania style leveling. A good start by any measure. Gamespot calls Fallen Order, “a worthy expansion to the Star Wars Galaxy” while IGN thinks it’s an “all-around amazing game”.</p>
      <p>There are, however, some reviews that raise a few questions about the game. Polygon, although it loved many aspects of the title, notes that the game was perhaps a little messy at times. Eurogamer didn’t score Jedi: Fallen Order which indicates they don’t recommend it, but nor do they think you should avoid it. Right now Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sits at a weighty 84 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/critic-reviews">Metacritic</a> and an 86 on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/7407/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/reviews">Opencritic</a>.</p>
