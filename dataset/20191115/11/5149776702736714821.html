      <h1>How to eat and drink your way around Long Eaton and Sawley</h1>
      <h2>Despite recent closures, there's still plenty to sink your teeth into</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:33:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>Halfway between Nottingham and Derby, the residents of Long Eaton have two cities at their disposal for a delicious meal out or a night on the razz.</p>
      <p>But the Derbyshire town has enjoyed a food and drink explosion thanks to the number of new bars, cafes and restaurants opening in the last few years, making plenty of very good spots on the doorstep, from breakfast right through to late night drinks.</p>
      <p>Despite recent closures - Carriages 1940s tea room and the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/cafe-closure-blamed-parking-enforcement-3536442">Marina Cafe at Sawley</a> - and the uncertain future of micro pub York Chambers (up for sale) and the Mill and Pub (seeking a new leaseholder) the appetite for eating and drinking hasn't dwindled.</p>
      <p>We took a tour to turn the spotlight on the best cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants.</p>
      <h3>Breakfast</h3>
      <h4>No.58</h4>

      <p>Breakfast is just one of the joys of this little cafe in Derby Road at... guess where? Number 58.</p>
      <p>The focus is on freshly cooked home-made food and customers can kick-start the day with sausage and bacon sandwiches, eggs on toast, a full English (big or small like the one pictured above) or something a bit fancier like a scrambled egg and salmon bagel.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the combination of satisfying food and friendly service it doesn't take long for every seat in the house to be taken.</p>
      <h4>Two Guys Deli</h4>

      <p>Rather than post a photo of the breakfast, a very nice one with poached egg, bacon, mushrooms and tomato with homemade bread, here's a picture of the adorable pooch Biggie, who you might see having a snooze on his favourite cushion.</p>
      <p>The dog-friendly <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/new-york-style-two-guys-2609848">New York style cafe</a> serves great tasting coffee and freshly baked pastries and cakes courtesy of Tom, one of the two guys; his partner Liam being the other.</p>
      <p>You really can't leave the little cafe in Station Street without buying some of the deli section's cheese and little pots of jam and chutney.</p>
      <h3>Coffee, cake and more</h3>
      <h4>Lock House Tea Rooms</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3386179.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_LE-tea.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Buttery toasted teacake at the Lock House Tea Rooms</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This quirky little tea room overlooks the canal at Trent Lock making it a good spot for people and narrow boat watching.</p>
      <p>Inside is a veritable Aladdin's cave of war-time and boating knick-knacks and old photographs invoking a real sense of nostalgia.</p>
      <p>Known for its good old-fashioned cooking, the traditional menu features dripping on toast as well as cream teas, butter-laden toasted tea cakes, and tea served in a vintage china teapot.</p>
      <h4>Boutique Desserts</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/incoming/article3186940.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JAJ_TEM_070819Desserts_002JPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>A Daim waffle<cite>(Image: Joseph Raynor/ Nottingham Post)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The town's sweetest food haunt is undoubtedly this <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/pretty-pink-boutique-desserts-cafe-3186076">desserts cafe</a> in Derby Road. Leave the diet at the door to indulge in cookie dough, waffles, sundaes, cakes, milkshakes and old-skool favourites such as Cornflake tart = the best.</p>
      <p>Actually scrub that, the Peanut Butter Stack with a brownie base, chocolate caramel and peanut butter is THE winner.</p>
      <p>If the sugary aroma doesn't attract you, the bright pink exterior will certainly catch your eye. There are two or three tables for eating in, collection and now a delivery option too.</p>
      <h3>Lunch</h3>
      <h4>Cod's Scallops</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3386175.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_LE-cods.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Fish and chips at the Cod's Scallops</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This award-winning restaurant and takeaway has taken humble fish and chips to new heights by offering diners a vast choice beyond the usual cod and haddock.</p>
      <p>Fish lovers can choose from salmon, sea bass, monkfish, hake and swordfish or a variety of shellfish, from crab and lobster to whelks, mussels and cockles, which can be accompanied by a chilled bottle of sauvignon blanc or the Cod's own brew Scale Ale.</p>
      <p>Chips are fried the old-fashioned way in beef dripping (much to the annoyance of vegetarians). For a healthy alternative, that's also gluten-free, fish can be baked in garlic, lemon and herbs.</p>
      <h4>Pete's Upper Crust Cafe</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3534623.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_upper-crust.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Pete's Upper Crust Cafe</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The breakfasts are good but the chips are even better. This cosy traditional caff in High Street does the best chip cob in town and is the place of home-made comfort food such as cottage pie, lasagne, corn beef hash and chilli con carne.</p>
      <p>Also serving jacket spuds and toasties, it's the ideal spot for a reasonably priced no-fuss lunch served by friendly, helpful staff.</p>
      <p>Named after owner Pete Thein, the smart-fronted property was refurbished with the help of a Heritage Lottery Fund windfall a few years ago and restored it to former Edwardian glory.</p>
      <h4>Mrs B's</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3538684.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_mrs-bsJPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Mrs B's cafe in Long Eaton</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Space is at a premium at the no-frills cafe, which has about 20 tightly packed seats but if you manage to get a table it's a decent pit-spot for cracking bagels, paninis and toasted sandwiches with a wide choice of fillings. Is there a more perfect combination than brie, bacon and cranberry?</p>
      <p>For something hearty and warming, the home-made beef stew and dumplings is a firm favourite at the caff, in High Street. Or for something just as satisfying but lighter, try the home-made soup.</p>
      <h3>Dinner</h3>
      <h4>The Butcher's Bar</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/incoming/article1064810.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/32226007JPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>A 16oz Porterhouse steak at the Butcher's Bar</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Doubters wondered whether an expensive steak restaurant would work in the town when the Butcher's Bar first opened in West Gate.</p>
      <p>More than two years on, you can't get a table for love nor money at the weekend unless you've booked at least two weeks in advance - and there's an even longer wait for Sunday lunch which has gained a real following.</p>
      <p>Championing some of the best produce in the region, meat lovers are spoilt for choice, with a wide range of cuts, from sirloin to rump picanha and onglet, cooked to perfection in the Josper charcoal grill.</p>
      <p>Can't decide? The 26oz steak flight for two, priced £52, has three very different cuts to share.</p>
      <p>It's not just steak on the menu. English rose veal schnitzel, slow cooked brisket and belly pork also feature, and there's some super tasty vegetarian and vegan dishes too.</p>
      <h4>Pelgrave's Restaurant and Pizzeria</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3501101.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_pelgravesJPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Pizza at Pelgraves</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The hand-stretched stone-basked pizzas are, let's say, LARGE, but you can take the leftovers home with you. Keep an eye out for the special discount deals, which make eating here even better value for money.</p>
      <p>Classic margarita, fiery Diavola, BBQ, meaty, veggie and breakfast toppings of egg and bacon are some of the options - but if you're trying to be virtuous, the Slimmer's pizza is half the normal side.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the restaurant, in Station Street, has an à la carte menu with starters such as salmon and dill ravioli and deep fried brie, mains of steak, venison stew and salmon, and desserts of Baileys bread and butter pudding, creamy rice pudding or a platter with three mini puds.</p>
      <h4>Esquina</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/incoming/article475605.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/equina-selectionPNG.png"/>
        <figcaption>A selection of tapas at Esquina</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Special occasion restaurant, The White House, reinvented itself to become a tapas restaurant bringing a little corner of Spain to Sawley.</p>
      <p>Staples such as calamari, patatas bravas and mini chorizo sausages make up the menu along with dozens of mouth-watering specialities such as sirloin steak, red onion relish and romesco sauce and sea bass, roasted red pepper, crab and potato salad.</p>
      <p>If it's value for money you're after, the weekend bottomless lunch at £29 per person, is unbeatable.</p>
      <p>As an extra bonus, there's a gin bar upstairs for a pre or post dinner tipple.</p>
      <h4>Bennetts Bar, Restaurant and Hotel</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3537748.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_bennettsJPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Champignons pil pil and bruschetta</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>New owners have shaken up the menu, combining British favourites with Spanish tapas and a two for £10 cocktail menu.</p>
      <p>A traditional à la carte menu comes with duck parfait and prawn cocktail amongst the starters, followed by mussels, fish and chips, steak and pasta.</p>
      <p>If you're more of a sharing kind of person (or just want to try what everyone else is having) the small plates section boasts spicy hummus, cheese machos, mini chorizo sausages, bruschetta, meat and cheese, halloumi fries, satay chicken tuna empanadas to name but a few.</p>
      <p>The venue, in Derby Road, has been given a makeover too, including the addition of cosy Chesterfield sofas for lounging in with a beverage from the new Fire &amp; Ice gin and cocktail lounge.</p>
      <p>As well as 24 classic cocktails, 12 tropical cocktails and nine mocktails, there's a whole host of gin and crafts beers.</p>
      <p>And if all the above doesn't what your appetite, the restaurant has introduced pre-bookable brunches - with bottomless booze if you so desire.</p>
      <h3>Pubs</h3>
      <h4>Sawley Junction</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3538206.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_sawley-junctonJPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Artwork outside Sawley Junction micro pub</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The family-owned micro pub's beer boards change regularly so you never know what might be on but here's a taster of this week's offering... Landlord Dark, Dead Beard IPA and An Electric Mango plus kegs with Pilsner and Weissbier, Green Mountain, Juicebox and Bison.</p>
      <p>Ideally located opposite Long Eaton Railway Station, it's very handy for commuters to pop in for a pint or designated drivers who can park up for free after 6pm and sup a coke.</p>
      <p>Great beer, plentiful gin, friendly staff, a warm atmosphere, some cool artwork and and often full of dogs - what's not to like?</p>
      <h4>Mill &amp; Brook</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/incoming/article891607.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Mill-and-Brook-Pub-26.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The Mill and Brook</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After a massive revamp the Harrington, a drinking den, changed into the Mill &amp; Brook, a cosy traditional but modern dog-friendly pub with an ever-changing selection of real ales, multiple gins and a fair choice of wines.</p>
      <p>Not the cheapest but certainly one of the most attractive and civilised. Since the pub was put up for lease it's lost some of its sparkle (and bums on seats) but regulars are hoping the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/new-tenant-needed-long-eaton-3481742">new tenant</a> will lavish it with TLC and restore the beating heart to the pub.</p>
      <h4>Trent Lock</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3537924.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_trent-lockJPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Cosy up by the roaring fire at Trent Lock</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A pub for all seasons. The huge beer garden next to the River Trent is a must for hot summer days and in winter the roaring fire makes it a cosy retreat.</p>
      <p>Muddy boots and paws are welcome at the dog-friendly boozer, which has the feel of a vintage country pub out in the sticks even though it's a two minute drive down a winding lane off the busy Tamworth Road.</p>
      <p>Good for drinks and food in the bar to the right, or waitress service in the restaurant to the left. We haven't tried everything on the menu but we can recommend the pizzas, Sunday lunch and sharing platters, while the triple cooked chips are very moreish.</p>
      <h4>The Tappers Harker</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3534499.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_tappersJPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The massive telly at the Tappers Harker</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Best for sport. If it's live footie action you're after this community pub, in Main Street, has the biggest TV screen for miles around - as well as several smaller ones dotted around the boozer.</p>
      <p>The family-friendly local, with the strange name (the harker was the hammer used by railway wheeltappers to check the safety of the train wheels), serves the standard Marston's menu of classic pub grub.</p>
      <p>The Monday to Saturday lunch club, noon to 3pm, offers a ridiculously cheap two courses for less than a fiver.</p>
      <h3>Any time of day</h3>
      <h4>Copper Cogs</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3386178.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_LE-cogs.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Ploughman's platter at Copper Cogs</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A great all-rounder, serving everything from breakfast to cocktails and craft beers with quite a bit inbetween. Since opening in March this year the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/first-look-new-long-eaton-2640058">cafe bar </a>in Market Place has acquired a loyal following.</p>
      <p>The friendly hangout, with a steampunk vibe, has sausage sandwiches, porridge or bagels to start the day and a lunchtime selection of baguettes, paninis and sandwiches.</p>
      <p>Generous sharing platters, salads and flatbreads are served throughout the day into the evenings and there's always an array of tempting home-made cakes on the bar that will have your healthy eating intentions flying out of the window.</p>
      <h3>Best for young children</h3>
      <h4>The Hungry Caterpillar Cafe</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/article3538037.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_caterpillarJPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The family-friendly Hungry Caterpillar Cafe</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There's nothing worse than going into a cafe with babies and toddlers and being met by the frowns of other customers.</p>
      <p>No one complains in the cheery surroundings at this family-friendly cafe, in Market Place, if little Lily isn't on her best behaviour - and the coffee for mums and dads is pretty good too, not forgetting some pretty mouth-watering cakes.</p>
      <p>There's never any shortage of high chairs and table service means there's no queuing with babes in arms. And of course, it's a comfortable environment for breast feeding, with no judgment from anyone else.</p>
      <p>With plenty of toys to keep little ones occupied it means the grown-ups can actually relax over a cuppa</p>
