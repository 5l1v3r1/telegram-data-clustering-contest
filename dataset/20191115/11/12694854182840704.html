        <b>Currys PC World may have shown its hand of some of the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-3934683">best Black Friday deals</a>, but Amazon is still chiming in with this Shark upright vacuum, now cut down in price by 43%.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Live out all your Queen dreams and Break Free on Amazon’s Deal of the Day, seeing a significant reduction on the Shark Upright Pet Hair Vacuum Cleaner, helping to whip any pet hair infested household to be spick and span in no time.</p>
      <p>Usually retailing at £299.99, you can now pick up this Shark vacuum for only £169.99, a hefty £130 off its original price.</p>
      <p>A lot of vacuum cleaner manufacturers are cutting ties altogether with corded vacuum cleaner models, leaving you powerless to the sometimes temperamental nature of a short running time that doesn’t allow you to whip round the whole house. However, this does place you in good stead if you go on a search for older models, usually massively discounted.</p>
