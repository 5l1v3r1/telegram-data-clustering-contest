      <p>Australian <b>airline</b> Qantas set a record. The carrier's plane flew from <b>London</b> to <b>Sydney</b> without making any intermediate stops.</p>
      <p>The flight was part of a research study on ways to minimize the negative effects of long flights for passengers and improve crew health. So the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner flew 17,800 kilometers in 19 hours, and 50 passengers on board saw a double sunrise.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of the test flight, the aircraft carried as much fuel as possible, and no excess cargo on board except passengers and crew.</p>
      <p>This is the second time in history that a civil <b>airline</b> has flown without a stop. In 1989, Qantas operated a cargo flight between <b>London</b> and <b>Sydney</b>, which lasted over 20 hours.</p>
      <p>Last month, again, a Qantas plane successfully completed the world's longest direct civil aviation flight from New York to Sydney. The 16,200 km route was completed in 19 hours and 16 minutes.</p>
      <p>Qantas named the effort “<b>Project Sunrise</b>” after the <b>airline</b>’s endurance flights during the second world war, The Guardian reported.</p>
