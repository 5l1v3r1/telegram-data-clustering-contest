      <p>The Philippines on Friday reported its first case of lung injury from the use of electronic cigarettes, which have become popular in the country despite warnings against vaping.</p>
      <p>The patient is a 16-year-old girl from the central region of Visayas, who was admitted in hospital on Oct. 21 for “sudden onset of severe shortness of breath,” the Department of Health said.</p>
      <p>She was initially thought to have a lung infection, but upon further evaluation, her case met the criteria for “electronic cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury” based on the guidelines by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control, the department said.</p>
      <p>The teenager was found to have used electronic cigarettes daily for four months. After that time, she also smoked traditional cigarettes.</p>
      <p>The patient has been discharged and has stopped smoking, the department said.</p>
      <p>Health authorities have been urging people to avoid vaping or electronic cigarettes, stressing they were not healthy alternatives to smoking.</p>
      <p>The first case was confirmed as the Philippines’ Department of Health and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) battled injunction orders against a directive requiring manufacturers of electronic cigarettes and vapes to remove harmful substances from their products.</p>
      <p>The FDA order was supposed to take effect on Oct. 24, but manufacturers filed appeals with the regional trial courts.</p>

      <p>Under the directive, the FDA was requiring manufacturers to remove such substances as cinnamaldehyde and diacetyl, which prevent the lungs from removing toxins.</p>
      <p>A group of health advocates has been urging Philippine legislators to pass bills increasing taxes on electronic cigarettes and vapes as part of efforts to discourage their use.</p>
      <p>U.S. health officials on Thursday reported 2,172 confirmed and probable cases and 3 more deaths from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, taking the death toll to 42, so far this year.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 2,051 confirmed and probable U.S. lung injury cases and 39 deaths associated with use of e-cigarettes, or vaping products.</p>
