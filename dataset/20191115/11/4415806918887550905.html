      <p>She told the November digital issue of Glamour UK: “It’s (cellulite) this weird thing where people think that it’s unnatural or a symbol of being fat. It’s so f***** up because cellulite is just a part of the human body.</p>
      <p>“It’s just genetic, it’s like having freckles on your face. It’s something that is there, you’re born with it, and it’s become this disgusting thing.</p>
      <p>“We’re told, ‘We need to laser this away, no one wants to see that’. There’s nothing more beautiful than when I see stretch marks, or cellulite, and people’s real skin.”</p>
      <p>Reinhart stars alongside Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers and said the actress and singer has been an inspiration.</p>

      <p>Speaking about her battles with anxiety and depression, she told Glamour UK: “I’ve experienced depression and anxiety. Not constantly, but I’m still experiencing it.</p>
      <p>“I have spells of time where I feel completely unmotivated, I don’t want to do anything and I question myself.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how to handle stress very well. I find that talking about it and sharing my experience with other people, and reminding myself that I’m not alone, has been incredibly therapeutic.”</p>
      <p>The digital November issue of Glamour UK is online now.</p>
