      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/devonsaysrelax">Devon Ivie</a> interviewed Great British Baking Show 2019 winner <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/great-british-baking-show-david-atherton-winner-interview.html">David Atherton</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/great-british-baking-show-steph-blackwell.html">finalist Steph Blackwell</a> for Vulture.</p>
      <p>Among other things, David described some of the terrific moments edited out of the show:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Were you bummed that certain moments of your “fun” side weren’t included?</b><br/>Kind of. My absolute favorite moment didn’t make the cut. When I made my cinnamon rolls during Bread Week, I baked a whole new set of cinnamon rolls for the crew and the other bakers because I had the time. They all came around my desk, had a roll, and we chatted for a bit. I could have spent more time doing my bake, but that’s me. I’m not competitive. I loved the buzz of the tent and being with everyone. I bake for people! I guess it wasn’t part of the story Baking Show wanted to show.<br/><br/><b>It’s funny because I remember seeing a handful of scenes of you hanging out in the background with your completed bakes, while the other bakers are freaking out and racing against the clock. I don’t recall that happening much in the past before. Did you always finish so early?</b><br/>Pretty much every time. [Laughs.] I always thought I could be doing more things, but I didn’t want to overthink it. People always said my bench was the cleanest, and that’s because I had nothing else to do. Obviously the edit made it seem like everyone was down to the wire, and lots of people were, but I finished early on almost every single bake. Around an hour early.<br/><br/><b>How would you pass the time in the tent when you were done?</b><br/>I’d go around and help the other bakers, but then the producers would tell me to go back to my station because I was spoiling the edit for the cameras. [Laughs.] So I’d clean and sit in silence. Or talk to the crew.</blockquote>
