      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- For the sixth straight week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers again says no changes are in their plans regarding water releases from Lake Okeechobee into the Caloosahatchee Estuary.</p>
      <p>The Corps had resumed water releases on October 5th at a rate of 650 cubic feet per second, averaged over seven days and measured at Franklin Lock and Dam. There had been several months of no water releases before that.</p>
      <p>They said Friday that no changes are being made. However, if local basin runoff meets or exceeds the targeted release amounts at W.P. Franklin Lock and Dam, no water will be released from Lake Okeechobee at Moore Haven Lock and Dam.</p>

      </p>
      <p>No scheduled releases through the St. Lucie Lock and Dam are planned at this time.</p>
      <p>"Forecasts indicate that the conditions on the lake are likely to remain stable for about the next month and a half" said Col. Andrew Kelly, Jacksonville District commander, "That means that we are still in a pretty good position, and can continue to release water to the Caloosahatchee estuary for the foreseeable future."</p>
      <p>Today's stage at Lake Okeechobee is 13.28 feet, down 0.07 feet in the last week, and down 0.17 feet during the past 30 days.</p>
