      <p>Jhené Aiko and Big Sean are currently monetizing the shit out of their breakup. The R&amp;B singer and rapper were a couple for a while, and they worked together under the name <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1868861/stream-big-sean-jhene-aikos-twenty88-ep/mp3s/">Twenty88</a>. Jhené Aiko got a giant tattoo of Big Sean’s face and then got it covered up after they split up earlier this year; it was a whole thing. And in May, Aiko released “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2042987/jhene-aiko-triggered-freestyle-video/news/">Triggered (Freestyle)</a>,” which sure sounded like a Big Sean diss song, though she insisted that it wasn’t that. Today, Aiko has actually collaborated once more with Big Sean on the breakup-themed duet “None Of Your Concern.”</p>
      <p>“None Of Your Concern” is a weird song. It’s very much within Aiko’s breathy, airy R&amp;B lane, and it’s mostly Aiko going through the mental stages of a breakup, landing finally on anger: “Get your bitch ass off of my phone, please leave me alone / I am not your girl anymore, you need to watch your tone.” And then, when the song seems like it’s over, Big Sean shows up doing some wistful and bitter sing-rapping: “I made you cum nine times in one day / Your two lips should come in a vase, you rode my face.”</p>
      <p>In the video, Aiko and Sean both spend time in a tropical paradise, staring longingly into the distance. They’re never onscreen together. Watch it below.</p>
