      <p>Automotive company Simba Corporation, is set to send home at least 1,500 workers, as loss-making takes toll.</p>
      <p>The firm, according to reports by Business Daily, is attributable to a tough operating environment.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see myself having more than five percent of employees attached to this group,” said Chief Executive Dinesh Kotecha.</p>
      <p>In an internal memo addressed to staff members, the management says it is working with heads of departments to confirm the positions that will become redundant from the identified areas at risk.</p>
      <p>Last year, the firm lost the BMW franchise to London-based Inchcape Plc and has been in constant litigation since then fighting to retain its Renault business.</p>

      <p>Several companies based in Kenya have retrenched in the recent past, citing hard economic times and difficult operating environment.</p>
      <p>In September, cash strapped East Africa Portland Cement Company (EAPCC) sent packing 136 supervisors and managers in a restructuring move.</p>
      <p>In October, Mediamax Networks Limited declared at least 160 employees redundant, in a bid to cut costs.</p>
      <p>In July, Cfc Stanbic Bank announced that it was going to lay off at least 200 workers in a cost cutting move.</p>
