      <p>A man out walking his dog was left stunned after seeing a huge RHEA bird - in a wooded area already known as the capital of Britain's booming wild boar population.</p>
      <p>Jason Burford was out walking his Border Collie and a Labrador cross Molly in the Forest of Dean when he chanced upon the big bird - which he predicts was 6ft tall.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old was shocked when he spotted the avian rounding a corner.</p>
      <p>Quick-thinking Jason managed to get closer to the creature and used his mobile phone to film it filmed it before it ran off into the distance.</p>
      <p>Jason, who keeps chickens and bantams at home, said: "I hadn't been there for years but I went on a whim as I used to live there.</p>
      <p>"I just rounded the corner and there it was. I'm used to it though, living in the forest. I wasn't worried.</p>
      <p>"The dog is good around other animals. But, for someone else, it could have been a shock.</p>
      <p>"It could have done an untrained dog some damage. Some don't even come back to their owners in the garden.</p>
      <p>"It's a funny story but it could have been nasty. I was just trying to get it off the track."</p>

      <p>Retired Jason, from Cinderford, Glos., said the bird was around six feet tall from where he was standing.</p>
      <p>He said: "I stopped videoing but you want to see it with its feathers fully stretched out! I've since discovered where it came from. It's been reported to the RSPCA."</p>
      <p>Jason has already seen wild boar in the area which is currently one of the centres of the UK's booming population.</p>
      <p>Boars can be dangerous and they have been known to attack other animals as well as people. They've alsp dug up gardens and playing fields and have even learned when bin day is so they can rummage in them for food.</p>

      <p>The area has also suffered problems with aggressive wild boars in recent years - something Mr Burford has experienced firsthand.</p>
      <p>He said: "I have had them run at me and chase the dog. You don't want that happening. They really frighten you.</p>
      <p>"Once the dog ran off into the bushes and a huge boar suddenly appeared. Well the dog came straight at me - so the boar came too!</p>
      <p>"I'd watched a film about bears the night before and it said what you have to do is make yourself big and scream 'AAAARGH' so I thought I'd do that.</p>
      <p>"The boar just stopped in its tracks and left! They're a pain in the a**."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds confirmed the bird was a rhea, likely to have escaped from a local collection.</p>
