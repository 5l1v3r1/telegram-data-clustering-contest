      <h1>The Org That Doles Out.Org Websites Just Sold Itself To a For-Profit Company</h1>

      <p>Today, the Public Interest Registry (PIR), which maintains the .org top-level domain, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963881/org-domain-name-registry-sold-for-profit-company-public-interest-registry-ethos-capital">announced that it will be acquired by Ethos Capital</a>, a private equity firm. From a report:<i> This move will make PIR, previously a non-profit domain registry, officially part of a for-profit company -- which certainly seems at odds with what .org might represent to some. Originally, ".org" was an alternative to the ".com" that was earmarked for commercial entities, which lent itself to non-profit use. That's not all: On June 30th, ICANN, the non-profit that oversees all domain names on the internet, agreed to remove price caps on rates for .org domain names -- which were previously pretty cheap. Seems like something a for-profit company might want. Removing price caps wasn't exactly a popular idea when it was first proposed on March 18th. According to Review Signal, only six of the more than 3,000 public comments on the proposal were in favor of the change.</i></p>
