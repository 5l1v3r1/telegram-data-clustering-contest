      <h1>The Netherlands reveals new identity and drops “Holland” for good</h1>
      <h2>The updated international logo is a “true reflection of the Dutch mentality” and is central to a brand strategy based around openness, inventiveness and inclusivity.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:58:57+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.designweek.co.uk/author/henry/" target="_blank">Henry Wong</a></address>
      <p>The Netherlands has unveiled a new international logo, created by Dutch design consultancy Studio Dumbar.</p>
      <p>The logo is how the country will be recognised internationally from now on, and part of a wider update to the country’s identity.</p>
      <p>The updated logo — <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2309564-nieuw-internationaal-logo-nl-met-gestyleerde-oranje-tulp.html">which cost £170,000</a> — retains the previous design’s orange colour, a shade associated with the country’s royal family, the House of Orange.</p>

      <p>While the old logo featured an expressively drawn tulip, the new logo embeds the Dutch icon in a more subtle way through the use of negative space.</p>
      <p>The N and L lettering forms a silhouette of the tulip’s petals. “The logo is intriguing, but at the same time solid and straight to the point,” Studio Dumbar tells Design Week.</p>
      <p>In this way, the logo is “a true reflection of the Dutch mentality”, according to the studio.</p>

      <p>A neater typeface has been used for the country’s updated name, which features alongside the tulip design in the full logo.</p>
      <p>Designed by Dutch foundry Bold Monday, Nitti Grotesk is an “idiosyncratic” typeface that can “communicate both professionally and expressively”, Studio Dumbar says.</p>

      <p>When the logo is used in conjunction with a member of the country’s kingdom, like one of its six Caribbean islands, ‘Kingdom of the Netherlands’ will be used.</p>
      <p>The new logo can be used now, though the full branding identity including a website and visual guidelines will roll out from the beginning of next year.</p>

      <h3>NL Brand</h3>
      <p>Before the logo, the most significant part of the branding update was the official change of name from ‘Holland’ to ‘the Netherlands’.</p>
      <p>The overhaul — known as the ‘NL Brand’ — is defined by three core concepts according to the government; openness, inventiveness and inclusivity. The strategy aims to convey the country’s strengths as well as encourage collaboration with other countries.</p>

      <p>The head of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, Minister Kaag says: “<a href="https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2019/11/08/new-international-logo-nl-with-stylised-orange-tulip">The new logo can be applied across a range of fields, from high tech to agrifood and from sport and culture</a>.</p>
      <p>A clear cut international image is positive for our exports and the attraction of investment and talent.”</p>

      <h3>Holland vs. The Netherlands</h3>
      <p>There has been confusion over the country’s name change since it was announced in October.</p>
      <p>In a release about the new branding strategy, the government says: “Naturally we are not banning the use of the word ‘Holland’, but we have chosen to stop using it on our official communications and products.”</p>
      <p>“From now on the logo will be the letters ‘NL’ accompanied by ‘the Netherlands’ because ‘the Netherlands’ is the proper name of this country.”</p>
      <p>The branding might run into some problems with translation; while ‘the Netherlands’ has a literal translation in nine languages, in some languages it is much rarer. In those cases, ‘Holland’ will still be used.</p>
