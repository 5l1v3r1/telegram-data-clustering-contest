      <h2>Longer, lower, wider 2020 Ssangyong Korando makes its local debut</h2>

      <p>We may be coming towards the end of the year, but automakers aren't showing any signs of slowing down their launches. Ssangyong is one of them, and they've just debuted the all-new Korando in the country.</p>
      <p>The Korando was first revealed a couple of months ago, showing its radical redesign. Gone is the rounded, egg-like body of its predecessor and in its place is a sleeker, more stylish body. It gets some cues from its two stablemates, the Tivoli and all-new Rexton, with its sharper, more rakish look. Its trapezoidal and slim grill are clear indicators of that. Ssangyong even describes the front end as ' reminiscent of bird wings in flight'.</p>

      <p>As mentioned, the 2020 Korando trades its rounded look with a more streamlined and aggressive design and that's made obvious on the sides. The flatter roof sweeps downwards towards the rear and the defined lines on its flanks adds more character to the crossover. Like the Musso and Tivoli, it has a 'floating roof' design that seems to a popular thing these days. As for the rear, it gets polygonal tail lights with LEDs, along with more creases on the tailgate.</p>

      <p>Inside, drivers are greeted by a more angular dashboard with a wraparound design. Straight lines and gentle curves dominate the cabin, and the driver oriented center stack aims to enhance the 'cocooned' feeling behind the wheel. Entry-level models get a 2-DIN audio system while the mid and top of the line variants get a comprehensive 8-inch touchscreen. You'll also be pleased to know that the car also comes with Apple CarPlay, enhancing its connectivity. Leather is standard across the board, although power adjustable seats are exclusive to the range topper.</p>

      <p>There are three variants and two engine choices to choose from. These are the 1.5T Sport, 1.6D Sport, and 1.6D Premium. The 1.5T is powered by a gas-fed 1.5-liter turbocharged mill that makes 163 PS and 280 Nm of torque. On the other hand, both the 1.6D Sport and 1.6D Premium use a 1.6-liter turbodiesel which is good for 136 PS and 324 Nm of torque. No all-wheel drive option is available meaning all three variants are front-wheel drive. All shift via a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>
      <p>Prices for the 2020 Ssangyong Korando are as follows:<br/><br/>Korando 1.5T Sport: Php 1,290,000</p>
      <p>Korando 1.6D Sport: Php 1,578,000</p>
      <p>Korando 1.6D Premium: Php 1,770,000</p>
