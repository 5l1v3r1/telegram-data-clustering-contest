      <h1>Notts County players risk fine for bad parking as boss Neal Ardley reveals desire for 'structure and discipline'</h1>
      <h2>Ardley eager for high standards off the pitch as well as on it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:01:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Neal Ardley has revealed his Notts County players are fined double if they are late on matchdays - and says even bad parking will see them hit in the pocket.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, it emerged how Chelsea’s squad are fined huge amounts of money if they break Frank Lampard’s rules which includes a whopping £20,000 for being late for training.</p>
      <p>That kind of money will not be changing hands at Meadow Lane given the gulf in earning power between the National League and the top flight.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> is still eager to have high standards on and off the pitch this season with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> defender Ben Turner tasked with collecting money from the offenders.</p>
      <p>That is then saved, totted up and used for a team night out in the season and Ardley says it is a useful way of imposing discipline particularly in terms of players’ timekeeping.</p>
      <p>“Every time you set the fines it’s about getting that structurer and discipline,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The obvious one is being late to try and make sure the boys are always on time.</p>
      <p>“We are quite ruthless with that. It doubles on matchday.</p>
      <p>“So being late is a big one. There are also little ones like parking outside of the bays at the ground.</p>
      <p>“If you are over a line and somebody else can’t park in the other space, then it’s annoying for others.</p>

      <p>“Not having a drinks bottle out on the training pitch is also a fine. There’s many others on the list.</p>
      <p>“But with Big Ben collecting them, there shouldn’t be too many arguments.</p>
      <p>“I am sure I am on the list of people who can be fined, but I think they have to be very careful if they want to come for the manager!”</p>
      <p>As the man responsible for collecting the fines, Turner joked: "I am a nice guy and the lads know I am fair.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't matter if it's an 18-year-old who is fined £10 for whatever, or somebody like Michael Doyle who is one of our most senior players, a fine is a fine.</p>
      <p>"If you break the rules, take your medicine and get it paid. Then we will have a decent pot for all of us to do something socially."</p>
