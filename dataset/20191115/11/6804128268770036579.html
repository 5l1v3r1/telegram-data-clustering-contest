      <h1>Tammy Abraham slams England fans for booing Liverpool's Joe Gomez during Montenegro clash</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool defender was jeered as he came onto the pitch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:39:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:39</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Tammy Abraham has revealed his delight at scoring his first senior goal for England, but admits he was disappointed with the treatment Joe Gomez was subjected to by home supporters.</p>
      <p>England sealed their place at Euro 2020 with a comfortable 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday night, but the victory was marred by a section of home fans who booed the Liverpool centre-half following his introduction as a second half substitute.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was involved in a confrontation with Raheem Sterling earlier this week, which led to Gareth Southgate dropping the Manchester City forward from his squad for the match at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Sterling's absence did not appear to hinder the Three Lions on their historic 1000th international match, with Tottenham's Harry Kane scoring a first half hat-trick to get the ball rolling.</p>
      <p>Abraham, who came off the bench, expressed his joy at scoring his first senior goal for England, but criticised supporters who jeered Gomez and urged fans to stick with the team.</p>
      <p>"It's a dream come true, I've always grown up watching England and to be here today and get my first goal, it means the world to me," the Chelsea striker said after the game.</p>
      <p>"It's not about maintaining [level of performance] for this season, but for many years, god willing. I've always believed in myself to score goals. There's still a lot in my game that I need to develop but I can't complain, things are going well.</p>

      <p>"We had the incident today with Joe where we are all England players or fans," he added.</p>
      <p>"We need everyone to be together, times like that we need the fans to lift us up and help us really when we are going into tournaments.</p>
      <p>"We said after the game it was unacceptable we don’t need that really he’s a great player. Things happen in football, things happen between teammates.</p>
      <p>"It’s about dusting yourself down and just moving on. We’ve all moved on from the situation and it’s looking positive."</p>
