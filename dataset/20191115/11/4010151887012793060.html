      <h1>America's Sweet Tooth Starts From Infancy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:00:29+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Preidt HealthDay Reporter</a></address>
      <p>FRIDAY, Nov. 15, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Bad eating habits begin at a young age in American children, a new study finds.</p>
      <p>Researchers analyzed data from more than 1,200 babies (aged 6 to 11 months) and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/parenting/ss/slideshow-toddler-milestones-second-year">toddlers</a> (12 to 23 months) between 2011 and 2016.</p>
      <p>They found that 61% of babies and 98% of toddlers consumed added sugars in their typical daily <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/default.htm">diet</a>, mainly in flavored yogurt and fruit drinks.</p>
      <p>Infants consumed about 1 teaspoon of added sugars daily (about 2% of their daily calorie intake); <a href="https://www.webmd.com/parenting/rm-quiz-typical-toddler">toddlers</a> consumed about 6 teaspoons (about 8% of their <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/guide/calories-chart">daily calories</a>).</p>
      <p>The main sources of added <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-sugar-addiction">sugar</a> for infants were yogurt, snacks and sweet bakery products. For toddlers, the top sources were fruit drinks, sweet baked products and candy.</p>
      <p>Asian toddlers consumed the fewest added sugars (3.7 teaspoons); blacks, the most (8.2 teaspoons).</p>
      <p>The study was published online Nov. 14 in the <i>Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</i>.</p>
      <p>"This has important public health implications since previous research has shown that eating patterns established early in life shape later eating patterns," lead investigator Kirsten Herrick said in a journal news release. She's a researcher with the Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>The findings did bring some good news: The percentage of babies and toddlers whose daily diets include added sugars declined, as did the amounts they consumed.</p>
      <p>But consumption of added sugars remains high among young children.</p>
      <p>Herrick noted that a previous study found that 6-year-olds who had consumed any <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/rm-quiz-sugars-sweeteners">sugar</a>-sweetened drink before their first birthday were more than twice as likely to drink such beverages every day than those who had not.</p>
      <p>"Previous research into the diets of children over 2 years old associated sugar consumption with the development of <a href="https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-health-cavities">cavities</a>, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/asthma/default.htm">asthma</a>, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/features/am-i-obese">obesity</a>, elevated <a href="https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/diastolic-and-systolic-blood-pressure-know-your-numbers">blood pressure</a> and altered lipid profiles," Herrick said.</p>
      <p>Only one U.S. health organization -- the American Heart Association -- offers guidelines on sugar consumption for children under age 2, researchers noted.</p>
      <p>"Our study's findings about <a href="https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/default.htm">infant</a> and toddler diets should raise awareness among health organizations and practitioners and inform future guidelines and recommendations," Herrick said.</p>
      <p>She advised parents to be cautious about added sugars in the foods they give babies when <a href="https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/features/weaning-from-breast">weaning</a> them. Parents should talk to a health care provider about which solid foods to introduce, and check the nutrition information on <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-labels-expert">food labels</a>.</p>
