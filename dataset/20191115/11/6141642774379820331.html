      <p>Figures suggest the UK is one of the worst places in Europe for access to full-fibre broadband, as Labour announced plans to provide the technology to every home and business in the UK by 2030.</p>
      <p>The party has announced it would bring parts of BT into public ownership under plans which it said will result in a massive upgrade in the UK’s internet infrastructure.</p>
      <p>While the UK is among the best-performing EU countries for broadband coverage generally, it lags behind most other EU nations when it comes to full-fibre coverage.</p>

      <p>This is significantly lower than many other parts of the EU – where only Belgium, Cyprus and Greece have lower levels of full-fibre coverage than the UK, according to figures from the European Commission from 2018 which were published earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The figures indicate that those countries are joined by the UK and Germany as the only EU nations with full-fibre coverage under 10%.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the figures show that full-fibre coverage in Latvia stands at just under 90%, while Spain, Portugal and Sweden have coverage of 70% or higher.</p>
      <p>Further afield, countries such as Japan and South Korea both have full-fibre coverage of over 95%.</p>
