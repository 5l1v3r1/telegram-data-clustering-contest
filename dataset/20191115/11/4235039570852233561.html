      <p>The most gloomy and “depressing” month from the point of view of meteorologists is <b>November</b> — at this time of reduced atmospheric pressure and cyclonic activity occurs, which forms clouds, TASS reported.</p>
      <p>This was stated by <b>Roman Vilfand</b>, the acting director of the Russian Meteorological and Meteorological Center. He explained that the prolonged lack of sunlight contributes to the onset of <b>depression</b> in humans.</p>
      <p>He noted that <b>November</b> and the first half of <b>December</b> are the most cloudy periods of the year.</p>
      <p>As a way to "prevent" the bad mood in <b>November</b> and early <b>December</b>, the meteorologist recommends spending more time with family and loved ones, as well as attending theater performances, exhibitions and concerts.</p>
