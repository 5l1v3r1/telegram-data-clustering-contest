      <h1>Amid Protests, Lebanon's Safadi Emerges as PM Choice for Three Parties</h1>
      <h2>The consensus on Safadi emerged in a meeting between Hariri, a leading Sunni politician aligned with Western and Gulf states, and representatives of the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally Amal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T03:13:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 03:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968129" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Three major Lebanese parties agreed to nominate Mohammad Safadi, a former finance minister, to become prime minister, three sources familiar with the situation said, suggesting progress towards a new government at a time of acute economic crisis.</p>
      <p>Saad al-Hariri <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/lebanon-s-political-crisis-what-happens-next-as-tensions-boil-over-1.8057407">quit as prime minister</a> on October 29 in the face of an unprecedented wave of protests against ruling politicians who are blamed for rampant state corruption and steering Lebanon into its <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-lebanon-is-on-the-verge-of-a-deep-financial-crisis-here-s-how-it-got-there-1.8127673">worst economic crisis</a> since the 1975-90 civil war.</p>
      <p>The consensus on Safadi emerged in a meeting late on Thursday between Hariri, a leading Sunni politician aligned with Western and Gulf states, and representatives of the Iran-backed Shi'ite group <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-hezbollah-1.5598890">Hezbollah</a> and its Shi'ite ally Amal.</p>
      <p>The news was first reported by Lebanese broadcasters LBCI and MTV.</p>
      <p>A source familiar with the meeting said Hariri had expressed no objections to Safadi's nomination, adding that MPs from Hariri's Future Movement would nominate Safadi in a formal process expected to begin soon.</p>
      <p>A second source, a senior figure close to Amal and Hezbollah, said agreement in principle on Safadi's nomination had emerged at the meeting.</p>
      <p>There was no official confirmation from the parties or Safadi.</p>

      <p>Safadi, 75, is a prominent businessman and former member of parliament from the predominantly Sunni city of Tripoli. He previously served as finance minister and minister of economy and trade.</p>
      <p>Lebanon's prime minister must be a <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/in-this-lebanese-town-muslims-can-t-buy-or-rent-property-from-christians-1.7416207">Sunni Muslim</a>, according to its sectarian power-sharing system.</p>
      <p>The next government will face huge challenges.</p>
      <p>It must win international financial support seen as critical to alleviating the economic crisis, while addressing the challenge posed by a <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/dangerous-lebanon-crisis-evokes-start-of-civil-war-defense-minister-says-1.8127988">nationwide protest movement</a> that wants to see the old elite gone from power.</p>
      <p>Lebanon's long-brewing economic crisis, rooted in years of state waste, corruption and mismanagement, has deepened since the protests began. Banks have imposed controls on transfers abroad and U.S. dollar withdrawals.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Served under Mikati, Siniora</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hariri had said he would only return as prime minister of a Cabinet of specialist ministers that he believed would be best placed to win aid and save <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-lebanon-1.5598955">Lebanon</a> from crisis. To that end, he has been holding many closed-door meetings with other parties.</p>
      <p>But while Hezbollah and Amal <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/a-blow-to-hezbollah-how-hariri-defied-nasrallah-and-paved-a-way-out-for-himself-1.8059613">wanted Hariri to return as premier</a>, the Shi'ite groups and President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, have been insisting that the Cabinet include both technocrats and politicians.</p>
      <p>Listed as a terrorist group by the United States, the heavily armed Hezbollah and groups politically aligned with it hold a majority of seats in parliament.</p>
      <p>The process requires Aoun, a Maronite Christian, to formally consult MPs on their choice for prime minister. He must designate whoever gets the most votes.</p>
      <p>Hariri remains caretaker prime minister for now.</p>
      <p>Safadi was finance minister from 2011 to 2014 under Prime Minister <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/clashes-in-lebanon-as-pm-resigns-1.5235406">Najib Mikati</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2008, he became minister of economy and trade in the government of Western-backed Prime Minister <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/1.4862142">Fouad Siniora</a>. He held that post again in a Hariri-led Cabinet formed in 2009.</p>
      <p>Safadi was part of the Hariri-led "March 14" alliance that emerged after the 2005 assassination of <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/1.5110308">Rafik al-Hariri</a>, Saad's father. March 14 mobilised against the presence of Syrian forces that withdrew from Lebanon in 2005 and was then locked in years of political conflict with Hezbollah over its weapons.</p>
      <p>A 2009 U.S. Embassy cable published by WikiLeaks described Safadi as having made his fortune in <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-saudi-arabia-1.5599258">Saudi Arabia</a> and being close to the Saudi royal family.</p>
      <p>He was first elected as an MP in Tripoli in 2000 but did not stand in the last election.</p>
      <p>His wife, Violette Safadi, is minister of state for economic empowerment of women and youth in the Hariri Cabinet.</p>
