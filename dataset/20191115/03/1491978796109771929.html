        <i>House Democrats are refining the language of their impeachment case against the president</i>
      </p>
      <p>House <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> are refining part of their impeachment case against the president to a simple allegation: bribery.</p>
      <p>The House speaker, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>, on Thursday brushed aside the Latin phrase “quid pro quo” that Democrats have been using to describe Donald Trump’s actions toward Ukraine. As the impeachment hearings go public, they’re going for a more colloquial term that may resonate with more Americans.</p>
      <p>“Quid pro quo: bribery,” Pelosi said of Trump’s 25 July phone call in which he asked the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for a “favor”.</p>
      <p>Trump has previously described the call as “perfect”. Pelosi said: “It’s perfectly wrong. It’s bribery.”</p>
      <p>“The cover-up makes what Nixon did look almost small,” the House speaker added on Thursday. “Almost small.”</p>
      <p>The House has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/impeachment-hearings-public-william-taylor-george-kent">opened its historic hearings</a> to remove America’s 45th president, with more to come Friday, launching a political battle for public opinion that will further test the nation in one of the most polarizing eras of modern times.</p>
      <p>Democrats and Republicans are hardening their messages to voters, who are deeply entrenched in two camps.</p>
      <p>Trump continued to assail the proceedings as “a hoax” on Thursday, and the House GOP leader, Kevin McCarthy, dismissed the witness testimony as hearsay, at best second-hand information.</p>
      <p>During day one of the House hearings, the career diplomats William Taylor and George Kent delivered somber testimony about recent months.</p>
      <p>They testified how an ambassador was fired, the new Ukraine government was confused and they discovered an “irregular channel” – a shadow US foreign policy orchestrated by Giuliani that raised alarms in diplomatic and national security circles.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Americans will hear from Marie Yovanovitch, the career foreign service officer whom Trump recalled as the US ambassador to Ukraine after what one state department official has called a “campaign of lies” against her by the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.</p>
      <p>The televised hearings are a continuation of a weeks-long<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/trump-ukraine-scandal-zelenskiy-biden-hunter"> congressional investigation</a> into whether the US president abused his office’s power to seek foreign assistance in the 2020 election. The inquiry was prompted by a whistleblower complaint that Trump was pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation tied to Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate</p>
      <p>It’s a dramatic, complicated story, and the Democrats’ challenge is to capture voter attention about the significance of Trump’s interactions with a distant country.</p>
      <p>Behind closed doors this week Pelosi reminded Democratic lawmakers of the importance of presenting a “common narrative” to the public as the proceedings push forward, according to a Democratic aide.</p>
      <p>“We’re in chapter one of a process,” said the representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat of Illinois and a member of the intelligence committee conducting the inquiry. The challenge, he said, is educating Americans about what happened “and then explaining why it matters”.</p>
