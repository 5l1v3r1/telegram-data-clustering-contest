      <p>INDORE: It wasn't an ideal first day as Test captain for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mominul-Haque">Mominul Haque</a>. Nothing went his way except for the toss, but the smile remained intact when he was grilled about his team's error-prone day.</p>
      <p>Despite a spicy Holkar Stadium wicket and a world-class fast-bowling attack, Bangladesh chose to bat. The reason Mominul gave at the toss was "they were hoping this wicket to break". The decision backfired and the Bangladesh skipper said he took complete responsibility.</p>
      <p>"If we had started well, the question wouldn't have been asked in first place," he replied, stating that the "team management" decided to bat first. Someone asked, "You said team management. You are the captain. Then who is team management?" "Ok, then I am the team management," the captain said.</p>
      <p>The Bangladesh skipper sounded practical when he said it would be difficult to make a comeback as they were lagging far behind. However, at one stage Bangladesh looked like recovering from early setbacks when Mominul and former captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mushfiqur-Rahim">Mushfiqur Rahim</a> were batting.</p>
      <p>Though the pair had quite a bit of luck, they showed enough resistance until <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ravichandran-ashwin">Ravichandran Ashwin</a> produced a beauty to remove Mominul. In his 80-minute stay, Mominul looked at ease, showed proper application and temperament. "I would say that I made a tactical error. I think I should take the blame for getting out at the wrong time. If I would have stayed on, it could have been different," he said.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old didn't blame the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indore">Indore</a> wicket for Bangladesh's poor batting show. "The wicket wasn't unplayable at all or else me and Mushfiq wouldn't have scored the runs. The problem is that when we are playing World's No. 1 Test team, we have to be mentally far stronger," he said.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh also missed a trick by not playing an additional pacer, and Mominul said, "Traditionally, we like packing our side with batsmen and generally play four bowlers with two seamers. These two guys - Abu (Jayed) and Ebadot (Hossain) - have been playing four-day cricket for some time. The others have not played a lot of long-form games of late. It is a 100% mental thing," he said.</p>
      <p>So has the Bangladesh team management lost faith in Mustafizur Rehman? "No, I have faith in everyone."</p>
