      <h1>Wanna Watch ‘Euphoria: The Movie’? Too Bad, But ‘Waves’ Is the Closest Thing to It</h1>

      <p>I don’t know if I’ve ever had a movie rip me open emotionally quite as much as <i>Waves</i>. I’m not exaggerating when I say that I left a showing and openly sobbed on the street on the way to my train. The film, which hits theaters in limited release today, follows a Florida high school brother and sister as they deal with a loss that throws their lives into a total tailspin, which might sound familiar, because it’s really, REALLY similar to the plot of a little show you might have seen called <i>Euphoria.</i></p>
      <p>Let me preface by saying that <i>Euphoria </i>is incredible, and so is <i>Waves</i>. This is a positive comparison. Like, if you loved <i>Euphoria</i>, you WILL love <i>Waves</i>. I would bet my hard-earned dollars on it. Lemme explain why. <b><i>FYI, there are light spoilers for </i>Waves <i>ahead, but they’ll make you wanna go see the movie, so...it’s your call.</i></b></p>

      <h3>The Alexa Demie factor.</h3>
      <p>Let’s start with the most obvious similarity: Alexia Demie is in both of these things. In <i>Euphoria</i>, she plays Maddy, a cheerleader who’s trying to deal with an abusive boyfriend while also maintaining her friendships and being a normal kid. In <i>Waves</i>, she plays a pretty similar character with a very similar arc, TBH, but she’s great at it! That’s why we love her in <i>Euphoria</i>. And her accent is basically the same. That’s a gift to everyone.</p>

      <h3>All the characters could realistically be in one big show or movie.</h3>
      <p>Both this show and movie are mostly about high schoolers, and the kids in <i>Waves</i> could a thousand percent exist in the <i>Euphoria</i> universe. All the characters we’re talking about here are dealing with really heavy shit, but that’s what makes both the show and movie so compelling.</p>

      </p>
      <p>One of the main characters in <i>Waves</i>, Tyler, is dealing with a career-ending sports injury, and it drives him to drink. And the main female character, Emily, is trying to help her boyfriend come to terms with the fact that his dad is dying from cancer. In both instances, we’ve graduated from “this one girl at school doesn’t like me” drama.</p>
      <h3>They have incredibly Hot Dads.</h3>
      <p>Sterling K. Brown plays the dad in <i>Waves</i>, and IDK, if you’ve ever seen Sterling K. Brown, but he is...hot. Also, you have to say his full name every time you mention him. That’s the law. He’s shirtless a lot in the movie, which is truly a blessing. I mean...</p>

      <p>Plus, both the characters have some seriously repressed toxic masculinity stuff going on, which makes them incredibly overbearing with their sons (shitty) but does keep things interesting.</p>
      <h3>The movie and the show are very pretty to look at.</h3>
      <p>One of the best parts about watching <i>Euphoria</i>, other than the essence of Zendaya, is the fact that the show is so damn good-looking. I mean, the colors! The lighting!</p>

      <p><i>Waves</i> is very much the same way. You will hardly be able to see it through the tears that will be pouring out of your face, but it’s a very aesthetically pleasing movie.</p>
