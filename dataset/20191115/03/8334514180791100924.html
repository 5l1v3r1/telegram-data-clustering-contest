      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - A senior Japanese diplomat on Friday asked his South Korean counterpart for a “sensible response” regarding Seoul’s decision not to renew an intelligence sharing pact, known as GSOMIA, with the agreement expiring in a week.</p>
      <p>South Korea in August decided not to renew GSOMIA, a pact that is intended to help Japan and South Korea share information on North Korea’s missile and nuclear activity.</p>
      <p>“In light of the current security environment, (the Japanese side) asked for a sensible response from South Korea,” a Japanese foreign ministry official told reporters following a meeting between Shigeki Takizaki, director-general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry’s Asian and Oceania Affairs Bureau, and Kim Jung-han, director-general for Asian and Pacific Affairs at South Korea’s foreign ministry.</p>
