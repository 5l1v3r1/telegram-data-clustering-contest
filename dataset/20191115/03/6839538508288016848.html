      <p>Police are hunting for thieves who stole war medals from a Dianella home this week.</p>
      <p>The burglary occurred at a home on Homer Street on Tuesday between 7.45am-4.15pm.</p>
      <p>Police say the thieves forced open the front door of the home and searched through the house, stealing a number of items before leaving.</p>
      <p>Among the objects stolen was a World War II medal group presented to the victimâ€™s grandmother, Nurse Fay Caplan, at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>The medals are of sentimental value to the victim as they have been handed down through the family after the grandmother passed away.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has any information or was in the area around the time of the burglary can call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report online at <a href="https://www.crimestopperswa.com.au/">www.crimestopperswa.com.au</a></p>
