      <p>The government doesn’t want your damn tax dollars.</p>
      <p>Okay, it does – please keep paying your taxes, people – but Treasurer Josh Frydenberg indicated on Thursday that he would consider bringing forward the next set of tax cuts.</p>
      <p>“We’re always looking for opportunities to reduce taxes,” he told Sky News when the topic was broached.</p>
      <p>It’s a major sign that he and his government may be open-minded enough to consider bringing forward the next set of tax cuts currently destined for 2022 to this year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/this-is-how-much-youll-save-if-the-australian-governments-158-billion-tax-cuts-pass-2019-7">first cut</a> put up to $1080 back in taxpayers’ pockets at tax time this year. The second set aimed would see the $120,000 income bracket be hit with a 32.5% tax instead of incomes above $90,000. It would in practice give taxpayers in that bracket up to $1,350 extra in their return.</p>
      <p>While the ever-optimistic Frydenberg maintained the June cuts made “an impact” on the economy, they appear to have not done so in a meaningful way. A glance at the <a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/content/dam/commbank/about-us/shareholders/pdfs/2019-asx/asx-trading-update-sept2019.pdf">Commonwealth Bank’s September quarterly figures</a> showed that the expectation Australians would spend half was incorrect. Instead, CBA customers clearly either saved the cut – deposits rose 10.4% – or used it to pay down debt, as demonstrated by lower arrears figures. While both clever moves by households, neither provides stimulus to an Australian economy that desperately needs it.</p>
      <p>Yesterday’s data shows a whopping <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/jobs-market-australia-economy-rate-cut-2019-11">19,000 jobs were wiped from the country in the month of October</a> – the single largest fall in three years. 10,000 of those came from New South Wales, one of two states that have long-propped up the national labour market.</p>

      <p>It’s a major concern, not least because it followed wage data that showed that healthcare and social service workers are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/australia-wage-growth-best-payrise-jobs-2019-11">the only ones in the country getting decent pay rises.</a></p>
      <p>Both jobs and wages are intertwined and serious concerns of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/rba-interest-rate-october-decision-economy-weak-2019-10">cut the official interest rate three times</a> to get things moving. While a delay is expected before the full impact of those starts to show up, they have so far failed to move the dial.</p>
      <p>It’s what leads Frydenberg to be considering bringing forward tax cuts now. While the first lot failed to do a whole lot, economists are more optimistic about the second lot.</p>
      <p>“Fiscal stimulus, by way of tax cuts to meaningfully lift household disposable income, is the solution,” Morningstar head of equities research Peter Warnes wrote in a note issued to Business Insider Australia “Despite below trend wages growth, bracket creep is alive and well.”</p>
      <p>Westpac chief economist Bill Evans meanwhile recommends bringing a partial cut forward.</p>
      <p>“Rather than implement the second stage of tax cuts at once, the government could phase in the income tax threshold changes over two years,” he <a href="https://www.westpac.com.au/news/in-depth/2019/11/the-case-for-quicker-tax-cuts/">wrote in a note.</a> “So, the point at which households move from the 19 per cent tax rate to 32.5 per cent could lift from $37,000 to $41,000 in the first year and then $45,000 in the following year. Similarly, the move from the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 37 per cent could occur at $105,000 in the first year and then $120,000 a year later,”</p>
      <p>These, Evans argues, would be palatable to the government because they wouldn’t compromise its undying need for a budget surplus, with the added bonus of being more effective.</p>
      <p>“The tax cuts in the second phase are likely to have a more direct effect on household spending since they will show in households’ weekly after-tax income,” Evans said.</p>
      <p>Ball’s in your court, Treasurer.</p>
