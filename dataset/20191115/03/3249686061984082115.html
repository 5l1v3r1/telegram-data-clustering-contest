      <p>On November 15,<b> JYP Entertainment </b>confirmed to various media outlets that <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/twice">TWICE</a> will be performing on <b>NHK</b>'s popular year-end music festival, '<b>Kohaku Uta Gassen</b>', for the third year in a row. </p>
      <p>TWICE will be joining a total of 41 performing artists as the only Korean act at this year's '<b>Kohaku Uta Gassen</b>'. Meanwhile, industry insiders suspect that project group <b>IZ*ONE</b> was also expected to perform on the year-end music show, but were ultimately excluded from NHK's lineup reveal due to ongoing vote rigging investigations. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, TWICE will be releasing their new Japanese album '&amp;TWICE' on November 20.</p>
