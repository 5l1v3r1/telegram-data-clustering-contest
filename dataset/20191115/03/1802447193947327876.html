      <p>The Steelers have won four in a row. They have some work to do if they are going to make it five in a row, but as bad as it is, it could be worse.</p>
      <p>The Steelers have ruled out receiver <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12184/juju-smithschuster">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> with a concussion and running back <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12317/james-conner">James Conner</a>, who aggravated his shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>Cornerback <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11377/artie-burns">Artie Burns</a> (knee) and linebacker <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13394/ola-adeniyi">Ola Adeniyi</a> (concussion) also will not return, the team announced.</p>
      <p>The Browns dominated the Steelers in the first half, outgaining them 182 to 104, but they lead only 14-0.</p>
      <p>Browns kicker Austin Siebert was wide right on a 45-yard field goal attempt, and the Browns missed a chance to fall on a <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13075/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> fumble.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13072/baker-mayfield">Baker Mayfield</a> is 11-of-19 for 151 yards and a touchdown. He had a 42-yard completion to <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/9403/odell-beckham">Odell Beckham</a> and a 41-yard toss to <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13899/khadarel-hodge">KhaDarel Hodge</a>, who entered the game with three career catches for 27 yards.</p>
      <p>Beckham has three catches for 49 yards, while <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/9405/jarvis-landry">Jarvis Landry</a> has caught three passes for 32 yards and a touchdown.</p>
      <p>The only bad news for Cleveland came when safety <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/5708/morgan-burnett">Morgan Burnett</a>, who has five tackles and an interception tonight, limped off with 1:26 remaining in the first half. Burnett has an Achilles’ injury and will not return.</p>
      <p>The Steelers have had only two possessions end in Cleveland territory. One ended in a missed field goal and another on downs.</p>
