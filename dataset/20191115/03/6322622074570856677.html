      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 15): Businesses need to change their consumer engagement tactics to better connect with consumers, said Gojek vice president of creative and executive director VJ Anand.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Malaysia CMO Conference 2019, Anand said businesses should look at changing the ways they market their products and services.</p>
      <p>"When you always do the same things in the same way, it creates a blind spot. When you change how you [market to your consumers,] they (consumers) will notice," said Anand, who added that once this is done, brands can better engage with consumers.</p>
      <p>He cited that for one Gojek advertising campaign, he did not have a script for the campaign's video.</p>
      <p>As such, he argued that the video, while not scripted, captured emotions that could not be scripted, thus allowing for more consumers to connect with the message of the video.</p>
      <p>He added that in the same vein, businesses should look at giving an edge to their brands, as well as looking for greater potential in their brands.</p>
      <p>As far as what Malaysian businesses can do to enhance the engagement between their brands and consumers, Anand said businesses should look at going more local when dealing with their consumers.</p>
      <p>"For example at Gojek we speak like Indonesians, so in the context of Malaysia, speak like a Malaysian to Malaysian consumers," he said, while adding that businesses should also look at communicating to consumers along regional lines as well.</p>
