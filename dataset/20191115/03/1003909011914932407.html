      <h1>'We've got three months': Green Line committee set to begin work on finalizing route</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T03:46:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 03:46</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Coun. Shane Keating says after the “churn” of political commentary over the last few months on the Green Line, it’s time for city council to focus on finally resolving the technical and financial challenges surrounding the $4.9-billion megaproject.</p>
      <p>City council’s dedicated Green Line committee will meet for the first time Friday to begin work on preparing finalized route options for council members to evaluate in January.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got three months to get this right,” said Keating Thursday. “In that three months, coming back in January, we will have a finalized alignment, a finalized plan, and then council will vote on that. Once that’s done, we move forward.”</p>
      <p>In the wake of a tough provincial budget that revealed the bulk of the funding promised by the Alberta government for the Green Line <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/funding-for-cities-takes-a-significant-hit-in-first-ucp-budget">will be delayed for another four years</a>, the city has been scrambling to analyze implications for construction timelines.</p>
      <p>The city still hopes to proceed with the project, though some previously discussed plans for the 20-kilometre Stage 1 route could change significantly.</p>
      <p>Keating said the city is in discussions with Ottawa regarding a more flexible payment schedule for the federal $1.5-billion contribution to ensure construction can proceed over the next few years.</p>
      <p>“What can we (build) with the city’s contribution and the federal contribution? And what can we do with the provincial contribution at a later date? Those are the things that we have to decide and that’s the next three months.”</p>
      <p>City council has been criticized by provincial politicians in recent weeks over the fact a route through downtown Calgary has not yet been finalized. Defending his government’s decision to significantly delay funding, Transportation Minister Ric McIver pointed to the city’s own delay in finalizing the centre city route:</p>
      <p>“Calgary city council has not even agreed to a finalized route proposal — despite this project dating back at least 20 years,” <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/mciver-my-mind-has-not-changed-on-support-for-the-green-line-project">wrote McIver in a recent op-ed</a>. “It is not as though the government of Alberta cutting a cheque for the full amount today would result in construction tomorrow. Far from it, given how debate in council has unfolded.”</p>
      <p>Keating acknowledged Thursday that it’s “critical” for council to set a new tone when it comes to the Green Line.</p>
      <p>“When the province says, ‘we’re concerned, what is the plan? What’s the alignment?’ — we’re saying: ‘we’re going to have a plan. We’re going to have an alignment in three months. End of story.’”</p>
