      <p>The ‘Prince Of Darkness’ and the ‘God Of Fuck’ will be teaming up and hitting the road after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-postpones-2020-uk-and-european-dates-2555689">Ozzy previously postponed world tour dates</a> after a long spate of illness.

      <p>Recorded in Los Angeles, Ozzy’s new album ‘Ordinary Man’ features producer Andrew Watt on guitars, Duff McKagan (Guns N’ Roses) on bass and Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers) on drums. It is expected to drop in January.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/astroworld-2019-travis-scott-kanye-west-marilyn-manson-megan-thee-stallion-houston">storming Travis Scott’s recent Astroworld Festival</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/marilyn-manson-releases-new-single-video-gods-gonna-cut-you-down-2558487">dropping new single ‘God’s Gonna Cut You Down’</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/marilyn-manson-provides-update-new-album-2526264">Manson has also been working on his new album –</a> which he said should be out by the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s the album that should be called Marilyn Manson,” said Manson. “I’m in a mode in life where I wanted to tell stories with this record, and it’s sort of like a wax museum of my thoughts, a study of the chamber of horrors in my head. All the romance and hope you can have in the world, here in the End Times where it can be a different kind of apocalypse for each person listening to the record.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I feel in fighting mode, ready to take it all on, and make a record, and keep that flag a-flying, and to make sure people know that this isn’t just sort of tapering off — this is hitting hard right now. And I think that’s why I think Marilyn Manson, self-titled, is probably the most descriptive album title, considering it’s the stories of what put me here.”</p>
