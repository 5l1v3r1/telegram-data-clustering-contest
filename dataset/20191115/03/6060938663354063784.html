      <p>LONDON: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Roger-Federer">Roger Federer</a> produced a near-flawless performance as he avenged his Wimbledon defeat by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Novak-Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> and qualified for the last four of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ATP-Finals">ATP Finals</a> with a 6-4, 6-3 victory on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Swiss started the tournament with a chastening straight-sets defeat to Dominic Thiem but found his best form when it mattered.</p>
      <p>Defeat for the second seed spells the end of his bid to overtake Rafael Nadal and finish as year-end number one.</p>
      <p>Roared on by a raucous packed house at London's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/O2-Arena">O2 Arena</a>, six-time champion Federer looked in the groove from the start, cranking up the pressure on Djokovic's serve and dropping just three points on his own serve in the first set.</p>
      <p>The Serbian upped his game at the start of the second set but Federer, 38, saved the one break point he faced and broke twice to canter to victory.</p>
      <p>The third seed, making his 17th appearance at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ATP">ATP</a> Finals, is into his 16th semi-final at the year-end event.</p>
      <p>Djokovic needed to win the title to have a chance at knocking Nadal off the top spot, but now the Spaniard is guaranteed to finish the year as the top-ranked player for the fifth time, tying him with Federer, Djokovic and American Jimmy Connors.</p>
      <p>"Great atmosphere, great opponent," said Federer, who hit 23 winners and made just five unforced errors. "It was definitely incredibly special. I enjoyed it from the beginning.</p>
      <p>"I played incredible and I knew I had to because that's what Novak does. It was definitely magical."</p>
      <p>Speaking about what was different from the Wimbledon final, where he squandered two championship points on his own serve, he said: "I won match point I guess.</p>
      <p>"It was so close at Wimbledon. It was a privilege to play that match, so many ups and downs. I couldn't be more happy right now."</p>
      <p>Federer finishes second in Group Bjorn Borg, behind Thiem, who also beat Djokovic earlier this week. The Swiss will face the Group Andre Agassi winner on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Djokovic looked nervy at the start of the winner-takes-all contest, double-faulting twice in the third game, in which he was broken to love.</p>
      <p>As cries of "Let's go Roger, let's go" rang around the cavernous stadium, Federer was dead-eyed on his serve, hitting eight aces, including a second-serve ace, in the first set.</p>
      <p>Federer's service level dipped in the second set and 32-year-old Djokovic earned his first break point of the match in the fourth game, which the Swiss saved.</p>
      <p>In the next game Djokovic slipped to 15-40 and sailed a forehand long to give Federer his second break of the match. The Swiss broke once more to close out victory.</p>
      <p>Djokovic had won his past five meetings with Federer, including their epic five-set battle in the final at Wimbledon in July.</p>
      <p>"He was the better player in all aspects and absolutely deserved to win," said Djokovic. "He served great, moved well, returned my serve very well.... He did everything right."</p>
      <p>In Thursday's early match in Group Bjorn Borg, which was a dead rubber, eighth seed Matteo Berrettini beat Thiem 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.</p>
      <p>Fifth seed Thiem did not hit the heights he reached during his three-set win against Djokovic, notching just 12 winners compared with 50 against the Serbian.</p>
      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas has already qualified for the semi-finals from Group Andre Agassi, leaving Nadal, defending champion Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev to scrap it out for the other spot on Friday</p>
