      <h1>Sen. John Kennedy says he's a 'proud deplorable' at Trump rally, hits 'latte-drinking, avocado toast-eating insider elite'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/john-kennedy-trump-nancy-pelosi-dumb-rally-impeachment">Sen. John Kennedy</a>, R-La., slammed the Beltway "elite" during <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> rally for GOP gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone in Bossier City on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, who received raucous cheers from the crowd, called out the Washington D.C. establishment and claimed they do not care for the average American as Trump or Rispone do.</p>
      <p>"I stand before you tonight a proud Deplorable," said Kennedy, referring to the moniker Hillary Clinton bestowed on Trump supporters during the 2016 campaign.</p>
      <p>"And, unlike some of the folks in Washington, D.C. -- I'm talking about the 'cultured', cosmopolitan, goat's milk latte-drinking, avocado toast-eating insider elite -- as a Deplorable, I believe that everybody counts."</p>

      <p>"And I care about you, and so does the president of the United States of America."</p>
      <p>Turning his attention to Saturday's runoff election between businessman Rispone and incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, Kennedy urged attendees to get out the vote.</p>
      <p>"Unless you're happy with 'crappy', vote Eddie Rispone for governor," he remarked.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, who holds degrees from Vanderbilt University, the University of Virginia and Oxford University, created controversy last week when he made critical comments about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. at another Louisiana Trump rally.</p>
      <p>At that event in Monroe, Kennedy discussed the Trump impeachment inquiry and said of Pelosi: "It must suck to be that dumb."</p>

      <p>"The same people that are backing Speaker Pelosi are sending tens of millions of dollars to support Governor Edwards. And all ... Edwards has given us is decline and uncertainty."</p>
      <p>At the Bossier City rally, Trump introduced a new political attack line against House Democrats amid their ongoing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a>, forcefully declaring, "We did nothing wrong -- and they're doing nothing."</p>
      <p>Hours earlier, Pelosi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/politics/pelosi-impeachment-bribery.html">accused the president of "bribery"</a> by allegedly "threatening to withhold military aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into his political rival" -- signaling that House Democrats are preparing to go all-in on impeachment even as the Trump administration touts its successes on unemployment and energy independence.</p>
