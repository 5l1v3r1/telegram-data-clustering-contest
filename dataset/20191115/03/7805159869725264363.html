      <h1>Xiaomi Redmi 8 and Redmi 8A kernel source code is now available</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T03:35:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 03:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Just over a month ago, Xiaomi released the entry-level <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-8-india-launch-snapdragon-439/">Redmi 8</a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-8a-india-launch/">Redmi 8A</a> in India. The devices offer great hardware specifications for the price, making them a decent option for the budget-conscious user. The Redmi 8, which is the higher-end variant of the two, is powered by a Snapdragon 438 chip, coupled with up to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The device packs in a massive 5,000mAh battery with support for 18-watt fast charging, along with a 12MP+2MP dual camera setup on the back. The Redmi 8A is also powered by the same chip, but it’s limited to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The device offers the same battery capacity with fast charging support, however, it doesn’t come with a fast charger in the box. Another point of difference is the camera setup, with the Redmi 8A featuring a single 12MP shooter on the back.</p>

      <p>In order to provide users with a common platform for discussions related to these devices, we <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-8-redmi-8a-forums-open/">opened forums</a> for the Redmi 8 and Redmi 8A earlier this month. Now, Xiaomi has released kernel sources for the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/androidpie/">Android Pie</a> release for both the devices. These timely kernel source releases give developers and power users the chance to dive deeper into the code that runs the device. This allows them to figure out ways to improve the device’s overall performance and capabilities. Kernel source releases also help developers release custom ROMs for the device, which in turn benefits users who aren’t satisfied with the stock ROM. With the release of the kernel sources for the Redmi 8 and Redmi 8A, we expect to see a major boost in third-party development for the devices.</p>
