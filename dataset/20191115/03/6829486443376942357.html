      <h1>Why Is Wish Constantly Trying To Sell Us Weird Junk On Facebook?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T03:20:16+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 03:20</time> by <a rel="author">Elfy Scott</a></address>
      <p>In the past year or so, it’s pretty likely that you’ve been scrolling through Facebook and come across a scrolling banner advertisement from Wish.</p>
      <p>These ads are probably presenting you with any number of weird-ass products including toilet lights, foam butt undies, or experimental sex toys.</p>
      <p>One time they tried to sell me a demonic pig skull mask (and they were not wrong to).</p>

      <h3>But Who Actually Are Wish?</h3>
      <p>And do they have the potential to change the way we shop online?</p>
      <p>Wish was launched in San Francisco in 2011 and it was originally intended to be a kind of wish-list app for thing you could buy from other sites – hence the name.</p>
      <p>Since then, they’ve morphed into an online store and managed to become the third-biggest online retailer in the world after Amazon and Ali Baba.</p>
      <p>And they’re growing really, really quickly.</p>
      <p>Wish doubled its revenue from 2017 to 2018, reaching an estimated worth of $US 1.9 billion last year.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The company is still haemorrhaging about $190 million a year right now but that’s just kind of just their current business model.</p>
      <p>They claim they would theoretically be turning a profit if they stopped spending so much cash on marketing and endorsements.</p>
      <p>Wish is currently shelling out a bunch of cash to Facebook, Snapchat and they have a $US 30 million sponsorship deal with the LA Lakers.</p>

      <h3>So, How Exactly Does The Company Work?</h3>
      <p>Wish are a crazy interesting online company because they’ve basically taken the ‘dollar store’ tactic with how they sell products online.</p>
      <p>When you go online to shop, typically you’re looking for a specific item – or at least know vaguely the kind of thing you’re looking for but Wish are trying to capitalise on a different form of shopping.</p>
      <p>They believe that people still have an itch for impulsive buying that’s not getting scratched by traditional online shopping.</p>
      <p>So their app and website present shoppers with online aisles of products just like walking through a crappy two dollar store in a local shopping centre.</p>
      <p>You can scroll through the app and suddenly be arrested by the notion that you need a blinds duster, a portrait of a psychedelic kitten and a creepy chin-strap to retrain the muscles in your face all in one hit.</p>
      <p>If you’re from China, this kind of online model probably sounds familiar to you – because it’s essentially the same format as the Chinese website Tao Bao.</p>
      <h3>The Dollar Store Model Has Proven Genuinely Successful</h3>
      <p>Hilary George-Parkin indicated in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/6/17/18679107/wish-shopping-app">Vox article</a> that the dollar store model is actually still shockingly successful when the rest of the retail industry is struggling.</p>
      <p>Wish have also managed to keep their products bizarrely cheap – you can buy a $2 pair of wireless earphones, a digital watch for $4 or an $11 vibrator on the site.</p>
      <p>This is firstly because of an agreement between China Post and the U.S. Postal Service for cheaper <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2019/03/13/meet-the-billionaire-who-defied-amazon-and-built-wish-the-worlds-most-downloaded-e-commerce-app/#28b1b6b270f5">shipping rates</a>.</p>
      <p>The arrangement ensures that packages shipped from Beijing to New York can work out cheaper than packages shipped from South Carolina to New York.</p>
      <p>The second reason Wish’s products don’t cost a lot is because they are actually just fucking cheap.</p>

      <p>Their quality of their products gets some really bad reviews online, with consumer sites like Trustpilot and ProductReview rating them really poorly.</p>
      <h3>But Their Product Quality Reviews Don’t Seem To Matter All That Much.</h3>
      <p>Despite that, Wish says that half of their customers end up coming back to the app at some point and that’s probably the most interesting part about their model (you know, next to the $3 buttplugs).</p>
      <p>Wish have recognised that 40% of the American population have about $400 in disposable income.</p>
      <p>So for a lot of consumers, it’s not about buying quality products, it’s about taking the shot with products that are so cheap it really doesn’t matter if they don’t work out.</p>
      <p>Wish believe they can revolutionise the way most of us buy online by tapping into our impulsive shoppers and they’re using a time-proven model of cheap-ass two dollar stores to prove it.</p>
      <p>The fact that they’re valued at almost $US 2 billion proves that they’re onto something here.</p>
