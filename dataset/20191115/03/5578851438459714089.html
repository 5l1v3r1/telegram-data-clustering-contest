        <b>A late goal by India kept Afghanistan from winning in the Group E match of the 2022 World Cup and the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifier.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Afghan Zelfagar Nazary scored in the 46th minute, but Doungel headed in his first goal for India to tie the match in the 93rd minute.</p>
      <p>The match was hosted by Afghanistan on Thursday night at Central Republic Stadium in Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan.</p>
      <p>India was trailing 0-1 at the half-way mark after Nazary put Afghanistan ahead in the 46th minute as he stormed into the box and smashed the ball past India’s goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.</p>
      <p>India created quite a few chances after being pushed on the backfoot and the efforts finally paid off in injury-time when Doungel headed home a pin-point cross from the corner kick taken by Brandon Fernandes in the third minute of added time.</p>
      <p>With the draw against India, Afghanistan remains third in Group E with four points from four matches.</p>
      <p>Up next for Afghanistan is reigning Asian Cup champions Qatar, at home on November 19.</p>
      <p>Currently, Qatar is on top of Group E with 10 points, Oman is second with 9 points, Afghanistan is third with 4 points, Indian is in fourth with 3 points and Bangladesh is in fifth place with one point.</p>
