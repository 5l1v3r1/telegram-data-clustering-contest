      <p>Turkey lead Group H with 20 points although France can overtake them at the top if they beat Moldova later on Thursday. Third-placed Iceland are out of the running as they have 16 points with one qualifier remaining.</p>
      <p>Both teams struggled to make an impact with Turkey striker Burak Yilmaz failing to find a way past Iceland keeper Hannes Halldorsson.</p>
      <p>The hosts pressed harder in the second half but Iceland's defence kept them from scoring.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Ozan Tufan came close to scoring in the 63rd minute but his effort brushed past the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Iceland also missed a chance to score in the closing stages when Hordur Magnusson's header was blocked by Turkey defender Merih Demiral on the line.</p>
      <p>Before kickoff, Turkish fans whistled as Iceland's national anthem was played.</p>
