      <p>TBILISI: Thousands of opposition supporters demonstrated on the streets of Georgia on Thursday (Nov 14) after the ruling party failed to push through promised electoral reforms.</p>
      <p>Protesters began gathering outside the parliament in central Tbilisi minutes after lawmakers voted down the legislation and blocked traffic on the city's main thoroughfare.</p>

      <p>In the evening, their ranks grew to some 10,000 in peaceful protests with a heavy police presence, AFP journalists saw.</p>
      <p>The protests came after the parliament dominated by the ruling Georgian Dream party failed to pass legislation to hold parliamentary elections next year under a new proportional voting system.</p>
      <p>Opposition parties accused the party's leader, Bidzina Ivanishvili, of orchestrating the bill's failure.</p>
      <p>Protesters say the current voting system favours the increasingly unpopular ruling party.</p>
      <p>Ivanishvili, Georgia's richest man, had announced "large-scale political reform" under pressure following mass street protests in June.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators on Thursday vowed to hold permanent protests until early parliamentary polls are held under the proposed proportional system.</p>

        <b>UNITED OPPOSITION</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leaders of almost all the opposition parties on Thursday held unprecedented talks, promising to set aside their differences and form a united front against Georgian Dream.</p>
      <p>"The holding of snap parliamentary polls is the joint demand of Georgia's entire political spectrum," Tina Bokuchava, one of the leaders of Georgia's main opposition force, ex-president Mikheil Saakashvili's United National Movement party, said after the talks.</p>
      <p>"This goal will be achieved through a mass protest movement," she told AFP.</p>
      <p>Another opposition MP, Irma Inashvili of the Alliance of Patriots anti-Western party, called on all opposition parties to take to the streets, saying Georgian Dream "must be ousted from power."</p>
      <p>Parliament Speaker Archil Talakvadze, a member of Georgian Dream, ruled out early polls, saying there was "no constitutional grounds at the moment to consider such a possibility."</p>
      <p>"We urge all the political parties to engage in constructive political dialogue in the run-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled for next October," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>Several Georgian Dream MPs left the party in protest at the vote.</p>
      <p>Georgian Dream -Â in power since 2012 - has seen its popularity plummet amid widespread discontent over its failure to address economic stagnation and perceived backsliding on its commitment to democracy.</p>
      <p>Critics have accused Ivanishvili of persecuting political opponents and creating a corrupt political system where private interests dominate decision-making processes.</p>
      <p>In June and July, tens of thousands took to streets in Tbilisi and 240 people were injured during a violent police crackdown. Two peaceful protesters lost an eye, including a teenage girl.</p>
