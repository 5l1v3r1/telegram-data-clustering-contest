      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 15 — Experienced <i>Pokemon Go</i> players are now able to add to the game’s geolocalised inventory of key locations, PokeStops, through a dedicated Niantic Wayfarer tool; <i>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</i> could also benefit from the influx of contributors.</p>
      <p>Those players who have attained level 40 in <i>Pokemon Go</i> can submit and review new PokeStop and Gym locations through the official Wayfarer website, run by app developer Niantic.</p>
      <p>Nominations can also be made through the <i>Pokemon Go</i> app itself.</p>
      <p>There’s a short test to make sure that would-be Wayfarers understand what makes for a safe, accessible, visually distinctive and culturally significant Wayspot — Niantic’s generic term for locations fundamental to its Augmented Reality geolocation games.</p>

      <p>Peer reviews are sourced from the Wayfarer community as well. Positive feedback promotes suggested Wayspots as potential new locations across Niantic’s stable of games.</p>
      <p>Those include not only the company’s first title, 2013’s hacking-themed <i>Ingress</i>, but also <i>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</i>, released earlier in 2019.</p>
      <p>All three are based on tracking users’ whereabouts in real-time, and all three share key locations, depending upon demand; now an independent entity, Niantic itself was founded as a part of search, data, and ad giant Google, whose mapping software it makes heavy use of.</p>
      <p>Wayfarer was first launched in September 2017 for the<i> Ingress</i> community as Operation Portal Recon, before being rebranded to Wayfarer in October 2019. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
