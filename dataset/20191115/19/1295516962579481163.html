      <h1>Look Back: What Do You Do Once Your Lead Character Is Chopped Into Pieces?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:11:18+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:11</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Cronin</a></address>
      <p>This is <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/look-back/">"Look Back,"</a> a feature that I plan to do for at least all of 2019 and possibly beyond that (and possibly forget about in a week, who knows?). The concept is that every week (I'll probably be skipping the four fifth weeks in the year, but maybe not) of a month, I will spotlight a single issue of a comic book that came out in the past and talk about that issue (often in terms of a larger scale, like the series overall, etc.). Each week will be a look at a comic book from a different year that came out the same month X amount of years ago. The first week of the month looks at a book that came out this month ten years ago. The second week looks at a book that came out this month 25 years ago. The third week looks at a book that came out this month 50 years ago. The fourth week looks at a book that came out this month 75 years ago.</p>
      <p>Today, we look at November 2009, with the introduction of....Frankencastle!</p>
      <p>In late 2006, Matt Fraction launched a new <a href="https://screenrant.com/punisher-serial-killer/">Punisher</a> series called Punisher War Journal, which was designed to be the place where the Punisher could interact with the rest of the Marvel Universe while Garth Ennis continued to tell his own Punisher stories in his own separate continuity. Fraction didn't stay on the title long and Rick Remender soon followed him on the book.</p>
      <p>Remender then relaunched the book at the beginning of 2009 as part of Dark Reign, Marvel's then cross-company approach about how Norman Osborn had taken over control of SHIELD and there was a new age for villainy in the Marvel Universe. The conceit of the new series (just Punisher now) was that the Punisher decided he was going to take down the biggest villain of them all at the time, Norman Osborn himself!</p>

      <p>Naturally, when you take aim at the most powerful man in the country, there are bound to be consequences.</p>
      <p>In September and October 2009, Marvel released a series of one-shots called Dark Reign: The List, which was based on the idea that Norman Osborn had a list of things he wanted to achieve. Most of the one-shots served generally as promotion for the ongoing series that they tied into and didn't really have MAJOR events in them and other one-shots were truly one-off tales.</p>
      <p>One of the few List one-shots to have a major impact was Punisher's The List one-shot, by Remender, John Romita Jr., Klaus Janson and Jason White. In it, Norman Osborn and SHIELD (now called HAMMER) track Punisher down and Norman sends one of his Dark Avengers (Osborn had formed his own sick version of the Avengers made up of supervillains disguised as superheroes, with Wolverine's son, Daken, being the Dark Wolverine of the bunch), Daken, to eliminate Punisher.</p>
      <p>After a pitched battle, Daken literally slices Punisher into little pieces!</p>

      <p>Talk about an unexpected ending!</p>
      <p>Well, somehow, that wasn't the end for the Punisher, as this led into...FRANKENCASTLE!</p>
      <p>Yes, the next issue of Punisher (#11 by Remender, Tony Moore and Dan Brown), saw Punisher return as a Frankenstein's Monster!</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The conceit of the story is that Marvel's "monsters" (characters like Morbius and Man-Thing) were being hunted and so they needed someone to help protect them, so when Punisher was killed, they figured out that one way to get some protection was to bring him back to life as one of THEM and then he'd surely help them out...</p>

      <p>Man, does anyone do off-beat horror better than Tony Moore? The guy's a genius.</p>
      <p>What an inventive approach by Remender!</p>
      <p>Obviously, this did not last for that long (I figure I'll cover how Punisher got out of it some other time - unless I've already done an article on the topic that I forgot about), but it was a whole lot of over-the-top fun while it DID last.</p>
      <p>If you have any suggestions for November (or any other later months) 1994, 1969 and 1944 comic books for me to spotlight, drop me a line at brianc@cbr.com! Here is the guide, though, for the cover dates of books so that you can make suggestions for books that actually came out in the correct month. Generally speaking, the traditional amount of time between the cover date and the release date of a comic book throughout most of comic history has been two months (it was three months at times, but not during the times we're discussing here). So the comic books will have a cover date that is two months ahead of the actual release date (so October for a book that came out in August). Obviously, it is easier to tell when a book from 10 years ago was released, since there was internet coverage of books back then.</p>
