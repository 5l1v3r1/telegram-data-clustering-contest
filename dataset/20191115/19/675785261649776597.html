      <h1>Bombshell Emmerdale underage pregnancy as fans predict Sarah will follow in mum's footsteps</h1>
      <h2>Will we see history repeat itself as Sarah, whose mum Debbie gave birth to her at just 15, becomes pregnant with bad boy Danny on Emmerdale?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>Emmerdale fans are predicting that Sarah Sugden could follow in her own mum Debbie Dingle's footsteps after her secret love interest was revealed tonight.</p>
      <p>The 14-year-old, played by Katie Hill, secretly met up with school friend Danny (Louis Healy) tonight and the pair ended up kissing.</p>
      <p>In the coming weeks, Sarah will be spurred on to take part in some reckless behaviour by Danny, including swallowing a pill Danny and Jayden give her.</p>
      <p>This is despite the fact that Sarah has a heart condition.</p>
      <p>Could Sarah also become pregnant with Danny's baby?</p>

      <p>Her own mum Debbie, played by Charley Webb, was pregnant with Sarah at 15 after having a brief affair with Andy Sugden.</p>
      <p>Is time about to repeat itself again?</p>
      <p>Viewers watched tonight as Sarah met with Danny, who was waiting in the graveyard.</p>

      <p>"I wasn't sure you'd come," he said as he greeted her.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't wait to get out of the house," she replied. "My gran's in a right mood."</p>
      <p>He asked: "What's wrong?"</p>
      <p>Avoiding revealing that Cain had got his own son kidnapped as a result of his carjacking plan, she replied wryly: "You wouldn't believe me even if I told you. Bottom line is, she can do some crazy stuff."</p>

      <p>"Yeah, I kind of noticed she was a bit... weird," Danny said.</p>
      <p>"And that was her on her best behaviour," Sarah replied. "If you saw what she was really like she'd scare you off."</p>
      <p>"No chance," Danny said. "It's you I've come to see. Not your gran."</p>
      <p>He then leaned in for a kiss... how will Sarah's mum react when she finds out her daughter is secretly dating?</p>
