      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:08:57+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Brooks, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/katie-brooks/</a></address>
      <p>People in Worcestershire are being urged to take action as more flood warnings are issued.</p>
      <p>The county has been battered by rain over the last few days and as a result river levels have continued to rise.</p>
      <p>The River Avon, Severn and Teme have all been affected by the recent rainfall and levels are expected to remain high over the next few days.</p>
      <p>Although a number of flood warnings are no longer in force, two more have been issued for Worcester today.</p>

      <p>The Met Office has warned that we're on track for the wettest autumn on record and a senior government official has said front line teams will remain on high alert throughout the festive season.</p>
      <p>John Curtin, executive director of flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency, warned that "everywhere is super sensitive to rain" as he urged homeowners to take steps to prepare themselves and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/people-urged-sign-up-warnings-17266533">sign up for flood alerts</a> .</p>
      <p>He said: "A number of our front line teams are now rostered all the way through Christmas already.</p>
      <p>"We don't want people to think it happened to Fishlake, it won't happen to me. Today it is Evesham, tomorrow where next?</p>
      <p>"The sensitivity of catchments to any more rainfall is very significant and only 50% of people who live on flood plains are signed up to flood warnings."</p>
