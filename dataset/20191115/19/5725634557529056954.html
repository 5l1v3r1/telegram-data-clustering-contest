      <p>TRTN has performed well since its IPO in July 2016. For 2018, the company paid $2.01 dividend expenses for its common stock, as for 2019 it is expected to have paid $2.08 yearly dividend. With a market price of $37.18, the current yield of TRTN is at 5.60%. As an absolute value, this means it pays $153.7M in dividends yearly. For comparison, the yearly dividend expense for all outstanding preferred stocks (with the newly issued Series C preferred stock) of the company is around $29.3M.</p>
      <p>In addition, with a market capitalization of around $2.63B, TRTN is the largest Non-US "Rental &amp; Leasing Services" company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (according to <a href="https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=ind_moneycenterbanks&amp;o=marketcap">FINVIZ</a>).</p>

      <p>As of Q3 2019, TRTN had a total debt of $6.93B, ranking senior to the newly issued preferred stock. The rank of the new Series C preferred shares is junior to all outstanding debt and equal to the other preferred shares of the company, the Series A and Series B, that totals $230M.</p>

          <b>The Ratios Of Triton International Which We Should Care About</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Our purpose today is not to make an investment decision regarding the common stock of TRTN but to find out if its new preferred stock has the need quality to be part of our portfolio. Here is the moment where I want to remind you of two important aspects of the preferred stocks compared to the common stocks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preferred shareholders have priority over a company's income, meaning they are paid dividends before common shareholders.</li>
        <li>Common stockholders are last in line when it comes to company assets, which means they will be paid out after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on our research and experience, these are the most important metrics we use when comparing preferred stocks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Market Cap/(Long term debt + Preferreds)</b>. This is our main criteria when determining credit risk. <b>The bigger the ratio, the safer the preferred.</b> Based on the latest annual report and taking into consideration the latest preferred issue we have a ratio of 2,630/(6,930 + 405) = <b>0.35</b>, indicating the company is highly leveraged, as it has 3x more debt than equity.</li>
        <li><b>Earnings/(Debt and Preferred Payments).</b> This is also quite an easy to understand approach. One can use EBITDA instead of earnings, but we prefer to have our buffer in what is left to the common stockholder. The higher this ratio, the better. The ratio with the TTM results is 330/(330 + 29) = <b>0.91</b>, which is satisfying and despite the high leverage, the cost of that leverage is relatively low.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>The Triton International Limited Family</b>
      </p>
      <p>TRTN has two more outstanding preferred stocks, listed on the NYSE:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Triton International Ltd. 8.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Shares (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRTN.PA">TRTN.PA</a>), and</li>
        <li>Triton International Limited 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Shares (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRTN.PB">TRTN.PB</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      </figure>

        <i>Source: Author's database</i>
      </p>
      <p>The other two "relatives" also pay a qualified fixed-rate dividend, pays quarterly distributions and bear a "B"+ Standard &amp; Poor's rating. However, they have a higher nominal yield than the new IPO, 8.50% for TRTN-A and 8.00% for TRTN-B. With a market price of $27.16, TRTN-A has a Current Yield of 7.82% and Yield-to-Call of 6.71%, while TRTN-B with the price of $26.65 has 7.50% and 6.87% yields, respectively. If we compare them to the 7.40% CY and 7.17% YTC, we can see TRTN-C having the highest Yield-to-Worst of the family.</p>
      <p>In addition, in the following chart, you can see a comparison between TRTN's preferreds and the fixed-income securities benchmark, the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFF">PFF</a>). As we can see, for the humble trading history of several months, TRTN-A and TRTN-B categorically outperform the benchmark.</p>

      <p>There are a total of 9 outstanding fixed-income securities, issued by a Rental &amp; Leasing company. Two are baby bonds, 4 fixed-to-floating preferred stocks, and 3 fixed-rate preferreds, one of which with a par value of $100. Except for the baby bonds and AL-A that is a higher quality preferred stock, TRTN-C has the lowest current yield when compared to the other issues.</p>

        <b><b>Addition to the</b> <i>ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred &amp; Hybrid Securities Index</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>With the current market capitalization of the new issue of around $175M, TRTN-C is a possible addition to the <i>ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred &amp; Hybrid Securities Index</i> during some of the next rebalancings. It will also be included in the holdings of the main benchmark, <i>the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF</i> which is the ETF that seeks to track the investment results of this index, and which is important to us due to its influence on the behavior of all fixed-income securities. I'll just remind you about the last year rally in the fixed-income borne from the redemption of the two "giants" HSEA and HSEB and the released cash of over $600M used from PFF to buy more of the rest of its holdings.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Conclusion</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>As fixed-income traders, we follow every one preferred stock or baby bond, which is listed on the stock exchange. As such, <b>TRTN-C</b> is no exception, and the homework we always do we share it with the public. It is not necessary for the IPO to be an arbitrage and a bargain but in many cases, the new security happens to be better than the ones already trading on the market.</p>
      <p>When compared with its "brothers", the new IPO gives the best Yield-to-Worst, equal to its Current Yield. TRTN-A and TRTN-B, unlike TRTN-C, are trading above their PAR and their YTW is equal to their Yield-to-Call. In case the preferreds will not be redeemed on their call date, TRTN-A has a better Current Yield of 7.87%, through its higher nominal yield of 8.50%. Still, the company performs well and its preferred stocks seem a decent option for a long position for the risk they carry. Unfortunately, there are not enough fixed-rate preferred stocks in the sector, and a further comparison cannot be made. After all, it is always good when considering a specific issue to see it from different angles.</p>
