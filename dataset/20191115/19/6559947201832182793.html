      <hr/>
      <p>When we reviewed the original <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/google-wifi/86484/review/google-wifi">Google Wifi mesh system</a> in 2016, it earned high marks for its aesthetics, ease of use, and overall performance. Google's new two-piece Nest Wifi system ($269) follows suit, along with offering a few nice upgrades, including more powerful hardware, a softer, more living-room-friendly design, and built-in Google Assistant capabilities. Although it's a solid performer, it can't keep pace with the Editors' Choice <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/tp-link-deco-m9-plus-mesh-wi-fi-system">TP-Link Deco M9 Plus</a>.</p>
      <h3>Google Integration</h3>
      <p>Google sent us the $269 two-piece Nest Wifi system, which includes a router and a satellite node (Google calls them Wifi points) and covers homes of up to 3,800 square feet (2,200 for the router, 1,600 for the point). There is also a three-piece set (one router and two points) for $349 that covers 5,400 square feet, and you can buy additional points for $149 each. If you live in a smaller house or an apartment, you can buy just the router for $169. To compare, the $299.99 two-piece TP-Link Deco M9 Plus system can cover homes of up to 4,500 feet.</p>

      <p>The router and the node components are stylishly designed. Whereas the original Google Wifi components are 2.7 inches high and shaped like hockey pucks, the taller Nest Wifi components have rounded edges and look like oversized marshmallows. The matte white router stands 4.3 inches tall and is 3.5 inches wide and has a WAN port, a gigabit LAN port, and a power jack embedded in the base. As with the original Google Wifi router, USB connectivity is lacking.</p>
      <p>This is a 4x4 AC2200 dual-band router that can reach maximum data rates of 400Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and 1,733Mbps on the 5GHz band and is powered by a 1.4GHz quad-core CPU, 1GB of RAM, and 4GB of flash memory. The original router also uses a quad-core CPU, but it is a 2x2 AC1200 router with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of flash memory. The Nest Wifi router supports MU-MIMO simultaneous data streaming, beamforming, and the latest WPA3 encryption, and it uses automatic band-steering to select the optimal radio band based on network traffic and signal strength. However, unlike the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/ubiquiti-amplifi-mesh-wi-fi-system-gamers-edition/123159/ubiquiti-amplifi-mesh-wi-fi-system-gamers-edition">Ubiquiti </a><a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/ubiquiti-amplifi-mesh-wi-fi-system-gamers-edition/123159/ubiquiti-amplifi-mesh-wi-fi-system-gamers-edition">AmpliFi Mesh Wi-Fi System Gamer's Edition</a>, you can't separate the bands.</p>
      <p>The Wifi point comes with a choice of three colors (Sand, Mist, Snow) and at 4 inches high and 3.4 inches wide, it's just a tad smaller than the router. It's a 2x2 dual-band AC1200 extender capable of 400Mbps data rates on the 2.4GHz band and 866Mbps on the 5GHz band and contains a Bluetooth radio and Google Assistant voice circuitry that allows it to do everything the Nest Mini smart speaker does, such as tell you the news, weather, and sports scores, stream music, set timers, and place hands-free phone calls. It can also control connected smart devices such as lights and thermostats.</p>
      <p>It uses a 40mm speaker driver to deliver 360-degree audio and has four far-field microphones embedded in the top of the enclosure. There aren't any LAN or USB ports here, just a solitary power jack. An LED ring surrounding the base glows white when you ask the Google Assistant a question and again while it is answering, and there's a small Privacy switch that allows you to disable the Assistant.</p>

      <p>The Nest Wifi system uses the same Google Home app that is used to control Google Assistant smart speakers, <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/google-chromecast-2018">Chromecast</a> devices, and other Google Home products. To access network settings, tap the Wi-Fi button on the opening screen, which also offers controls for any connected smart devices such as lights, smart plugs, and thermostats. The Wifi screen displays your internet status, the number of installed Wifi points, and the number of connected devices.</p>
      <p>Tap the Internet button to run a speed test to measure your internet upload and download speeds and to test mesh connectivity between the router and Wifi points. Below the map is a tab that displays the latest speed test results, and below that is a Devices tab where you can give network priority to specific devices. Continue scrolling to see the Family Wi-Fi and Guest Network tabs.</p>
      <p>Family Wi-Fi lets you pause internet access and create Wi-Fi access schedules for family members. Here you can create Groups and enable the SafeSearch feature to restrict access to websites that contain adult content. However, you don't get the granular age-appropriate filters that you get with the TP-Link Deco M9 Plus. You can also access these and other settings by tapping the gear icon in the upper right corner of the Wi-Fi screen. Here you can change security settings and optimize the network for gaming, but if you want to access advanced WAN, DNS, LAN, and port management settings, you'll have to download a separate Google Wifi app.</p>
      <h3>Solid Performance</h3>

      <p>Setup is easy. I connected the router to my modem, powered it up, and downloaded the Google Home mobile app. I created an account, tapped Get Started in the Create A Home screen, tapped Setup New Devices, and created a Home. The app went to work looking for devices and immediately found the router. I tapped Next, scanned the QR code on the base with my phone's camera, agreed to join the Google Home network, and was connected to the router in a matter of seconds. I gave the new network a name and a password, gave it a location, and the router was up and running in about 45 seconds. The app already knew that I had a two-pack so I tapped Yes to add the point and followed the in-app instructions to place it in an open area no more than two rooms away from the router.</p>
      <p>The app found the point right away, so I tapped Next and waited several seconds for it to connect, which was verified by a chime. I gave the point a location, waited a few seconds for it to connect to my network, and tapped Next to set up Google Assistant. Here, you can choose to opt out of the Google Assistant optimization process (which sends data to Google) or go all-in. Once the Assistant was configured, the app performed a mesh test and the installation was complete.</p>
      <p>The Nest Wifi system turned in respectable scores on our throughput performance tests. The router's score of 498Mbps on the close-proximity (same-room) test was a tad faster than the original Google Wifi router and the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/371022/nokia-wifi-beacon-1-mesh-router">Nokia Beacon 1</a> router, but couldn't catch the Netgear XRM570 and the Deco M9 Plus. At a distance of 30 feet, the Nest Wifi router garnered 291Mbps, outperforming the Google Wifi, the Nokia Beacon 1, and the Deco M9 Plus routers and coming in right behind the Netgear XRM570 router.</p>

      <p>On the close-proximity test, the Nest Wifi point scored 251Mbps, beating the Google Wifi point and the Nokia Beacon 1 satellite node. Thanks to their dedicated 5GHz backhaul bands, the Netgear XRM570 and Deco M9 Plus satellite nodes came out ahead. The Nest Wifi point's score of 190Mbps at a distance of 30 feet was faster than its predecessor, but 5Mbps slower than the Nokia Beacon 1 node. Once again, the Netgear XRM570 and Deco M9 Plus satellite nodes were significantly faster.</p>

      <p>The Wifi point's Google Assistant feature worked flawlessly delivering news, sports, and weather when asked. The far-field microphones did a great job of processing my requests from across the room and the built-in speaker delivered good all-around audio while streaming music, but doesn't offer the deep bass output that you get with the Alexa-powered Netgear Orbi RVS40V satellite. I had no trouble controlling Philips Hue lights and other smart home devices using Google Assistant voice commands with the Wifi point.</p>
      <h3>Your New Wi-Fi Assistant?</h3>
      <p>The Google Nest Wifi provides an easy way to eliminate Wi-Fi dead zones while bringing Google Assistant to any room in your house. It's very easy to install and delivers solid throughput performance, and it offers parental controls that will block access to adult websites and allow you to create access schedules and pause internet access with the touch of a button. You can manage your network using the same mobile app that you use to control other Google Home devices, but it lacks protection against viruses and other malware. Moreover, you'll need a separate app to tweak advanced settings.</p>
      <p>But if integrating the Google Assistant voice platform isn't a priority, you'll get better performance with the TP-Link Deco M9 Plus. It costs $30 more than the two-piece Nest Wifi, but it offers more coverage and advanced features, and remains our Editors' Choice for Wi-Fi mesh systems.</p>
