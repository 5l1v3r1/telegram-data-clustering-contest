      <h1>Experts worried about safety of Srisailam dam</h1>
      <h2>‘Sagar, Amaravati will suffer severe damage if urgent measures are not taken’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:22:18+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/G-Venkataramana-Rao-661/" target="_blank">G Venkataramana Rao</a></address>
      <p>Irrigation experts are jittery about the condition of the Srisailam dam, which had to handle huge volumes of water in recent times.</p>
      <p>The crest gates of Srisailam dam had to be lifted eight times in the last five and a half months to release flood water. Every time the gates are lifted, thousands of cusecs of water drops from a height of 250 feet to pound the apron. The scouring or erosion caused by the water was enormous.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the dam, designed for a maximum flood of 19 lakh cusecs, endured a flood of 25.5 lakh cusecs.</p>
      <p>According to a survey conducted last summer (2018), the scouring resulted in the formation of a huge pit in the apron downstream the dam. And a structure protecting the ‘toe’ and foundation of the main dam has weakened.</p>
      <p>Repairs need to be taken up on a war-footing to prevent irreparable damage.</p>
      <h3>‘Systematic neglect’</h3>
      <p>Former Irrigation Superintending Engineer K. Haranath told <i>The Hindu </i>that “protection works” and repairs should be undertaken every year, but in the case of the Srisailam dam no such effort has been made since 2003.</p>
      <p>Engineers who undertook an inspection last year found the steel cylinders of the coffer dam that protected the toe and foundation of the main dam lay exposed, Mr. Haranath said.</p>
      <p>No effort was made to replace the concrete apron after its erosion. The rock below the apron was relatively soft “quartzite interbedded with a shale band” that was getting scoured easily, he explained.</p>
      <p>A cavity of 4,500 cubic metres (CuM) was found in blocks 8 to 11 of the apron in 2002, but only 143 CuM could be filled, Mr. Haranath said.</p>
      <p>On October 3, 2009, the dam was subjected to maximum stresses for the first time after its commissioning in 1983-84. The dam tilted towards downstream by 4 mm and the tilt reached a maximum of 8.8 mm on October 8, 2009. Fortunately, it returned to normal after the flood receded.</p>
      <h3>Climate change</h3>
      <p>With climate change, it was becoming harder to predict the intensity and interval between floods.</p>
      <p>The National Institute of Oceanography, Goa and Visakhapatnam, conducted a detailed survey last summer, but the report is yet to be made public, Mr. Haranath said.</p>
      <p>In the event of the Srisailam dam bursting, the Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala dams, Prakasam Barrage and half of Vijayawada and Amaravati would be washed away, and Rayalaseema would become a desert, he added.</p>
