      <p>A new update has rolled out today for the Xbox One ecosystem today, Microsoft has confirmed. The flagship addition is the Xbox Action for Google Assistant, which allows players to control their consoles in different ways. Those ways include using Google Assistant compatible smart speakers to control things such as powering a console on or off or starting an app or game. If a smart speaker isn’t around then you can use the Google Assistant app on iOS and Android. Currently, only English is supported but more languages are expected to be added soon.</p>
      <p>Text filters have been added where players can select how much of the language from incoming text messages on Xbox is filtered. There are four levels of filtration which are Friendly, Medium, Mature and Unfiltered. Regardless of filter setting any messages that break the guidelines can be reported. To toggle the filters you’ll need to go into the privacy safety settings. Speech to text diction has also been added so you don’t even have to type out messages. The following languages are supported:</p>
      <p>English (US &amp; Canada), English (India), English (UK), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Spain), French (Canada), French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese.</p>
      <p>Gamertag improvements will allow players to change the alphabet they use to create and display their profiles. 13 alphabets have been added which can support over 200 languages. Players can also add number suffix’ to names as well. However, there is a caveat:</p>
      <blockquote>Existing players can change their gamertags to take advantage of these updates if they wish, but by doing so will relinquish their original gamertag.</blockquote>
      <p>Mixer has also been updated so viewers can move the chat left or right of the screen, or make it disappear altogether. A subscription reminder button will also appear if a sub will expire within a week.</p>
