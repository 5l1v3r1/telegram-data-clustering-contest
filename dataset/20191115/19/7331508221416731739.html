      <p>INDIANAPOLIS -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578570/jacoby-brissett">Jacoby Brissett</a> will be the starter for Sunday's AFC South game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, coach Frank Reich said Friday.</p>
      <p>Brissett missed the Week 10 game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> due to a sprained MCL in his left knee. He originally suffered the injury after guard <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3129308/quenton-nelson">Quenton Nelson</a> was pushed back into him in the first half of the Week 9 game at Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>Brissett was a limited participant in all three days of practice leading up to the game against the Dolphins. The Colts, who are on a two-game losing streak, officially ruled him out the day before the game.</p>
      <p>Reich said early in the week that Brissett would be the starter as long he was able to practice this week. Brissett was a full participant in practice every day this week.</p>
      <p>"He's looked really good," Reich said. "I don't want to put a percentage on it -- I just know he's good enough to play."</p>
      <p>Receiver <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14924/ty-hilton">T.Y. Hilton</a> will miss his third straight game due to a calf injury. The Colts (5-4) are 0-8 without Hilton in his career.</p>
