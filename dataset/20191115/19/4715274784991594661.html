      <p> For three days, starting Nov. 7, Instituto Cervantes showed a selection of films from the festival, in their original Spanish version with subtitles in English, at the venue for free.</p>
      <p>The festival’s final leg kicked off with the Argentinean black comedy <i>El cuento de las comadrejas </i></p>
      <p>(The Weasels’ Tale), which won the “Premio del Público” (Audience Choice Award) of PELÍCULA 2019 at Greenbelt 3 in Makati City last month.</p>
      <p>The film, which was directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker <b>Juan José Campanella</b></p>
      <p>, tells the story of a famous actress, an actor, a film director and screenwriter who were popular during the Golden Age of Cinema, as they do the impossible to preserve the world they have created.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 8, PELÍCULA screened <b>Gastón Duprat</b>’s <i>Mi obra maestra </i></p>
      <p>(2018), which focuses on two friends with very different personalities: Arturo, a charming and unscrupulous art dealer, and Renzo, a sullen painter whose fame has declined.</p>
      <p>In the film, Arturo tries to relaunch the artistic career of Renzo, but things get from bad to worse, until they come up with an extremely ludicrous plan. The film got the Audience Award at the Valladolid International Film Festival last year.</p>
      <p><i>El mejor verano de mi vida </i>(2018), directed by <b>Dani de la Orden</b></p>
      <p>, was screened on Nov. 9. The popular Spanish comedy delves into the life of Curro, an unlucky salesman burdened with debt, as he tries to fulfill his promise to his son to go on an unforgettable summer holiday.</p>
      <p>PELÍCULA closed with the drama <i>El reino </i></p>
      <p>(2018), which has received more than 30 awards worldwide. Highlighting a very interesting insight into contemporary politics and corruption, the film is about a Spanish politician who enjoys the good life, while enriching himself with public funds. When a friend and fellow member of his political party gets accused of corruption, he tries to cover up for him, against the directives of the leaders of his party.</p>
      <p>The Spanish Film Festival was presented by Instituto Cervantes along with the Embassy of Spain, AECID, UP Film Institute, TurEspaña and the Film Development Council of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>The event was also made possible by Rustan’s, The PTC Group of Companies, Cinematheque Center Iloilo, Spanish Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, TBA Studios, Netflix, and Spanish restaurants La Picara, Barcino, Bar Pintxos, Tapella and Pablo Bistro.</p>
