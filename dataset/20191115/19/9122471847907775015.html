      <h1>Philadelphia Eagles Reportedly Plan To Sign Veteran RB Jay Ajayi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:05:53+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Injuries have plagued the Philadelphia Eagles on offense this year, and the hits keep coming as the team will now be without Darren Sproles for the rest of the season. In an effort to bolster their depth chart, the front office has signed Jay Ajayi.</p>
      <p>Ajayi was an impact player for a few years when he was with the Miami Dolphins. He was then traded to the Eagles in 2017 and helped the franchise win its first Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>The Eagles thought Ajayi would have a breakout season in 2018, but he unfortunately tore his ACL after just four games. Several teams decided to pass on the veteran tailback in free agency this year because there were concerns about his health.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it appears Philadelphiaâ€™s coaching staff is confident enough to take another chance on Ajayi.</p>
      <p>According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, the Eagles intend to sign Ajayi to a one-year deal.</p>
      <p>This will mark his second stint in the City of Brotherly Love.</p>

      <p>Philadelphia is already without Darren Sproles and Jordan Howard, so signing a veteran player that knows the system well makes a bunch of sense.</p>
      <p>Miles Sanders will most likely shoulder the workload this weekend, but Ajayi could see a few snaps out of the backfield.</p>
      <p>The Eagles have a tough matchup this Sunday as they host the New England Patriots in a rematch of Super Bowl LII.</p>
