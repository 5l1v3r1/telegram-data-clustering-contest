      <p>Manchester United are weighing up a big January transfer swoop for highly rated youngsters Jadon Sancho and Erling-Braut Haaland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has identified the teenage duo as his top priorities in the upcoming transfer window, as United look to get their business done earl doors when the window re-opens.</p>
      <p>Both are likely to cost the Old Trafford outfit around £200m in total, with Borussia Dortmund valuing England international Sancho at £100m, while RB Salzburg striker Haaland is rated as an £85m purchase by his club.</p>
      <p>Sancho has made 21 appearances for club and country this season, finding the back of the net six times, while Haaland has scored 22 goals in 18 appearances, scoring a hat-trick for Austrian outfit Salzburg against Wolfsberger at the weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> tried to sign Sancho last summer, but their failure to make the Champions League scuppered any potential deal, with the former Manchester City star singing a new contract with Dortmund.</p>
      <p>With Haaland, United hope his relationship with Solskjaer, who managed him at Molde, can give them a head start over their rivals in the race to sign Europe's most prolific young striker.</p>

      <p>Haaland is the son of former Manchester City and Leeds midfielder Alf-Inge, and United have had Haaland watched several times this season, with Solskjaer sending Simon Wells, one of his most senior and trusted scouts, to assess the youngster in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Haaland's exploits have made him one of the most sought-after young players in the world, with one hurdle for United being his apparent favouring of a move to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> .</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Both Spanish clubs are also tracking Haaland, but United will not be put off by interest from their more illustrious rivals and their ability to guarantee Champions League football.</p>
