      <p>Protesters and students have been barricading themselves inside Hong Kong's universities.</p>
      <p>They built concrete walls and watchtowers and had weapons that included bows and arrows, catapults and hundreds of petrol bombs.</p>
      <p>The idea is to stop police from raiding the facilities.</p>
      <p>It is the latest development in anti-government protests in the city-state, which are now into their sixth month.</p>
      <p>The territory has been embroiled in a week of violence after an officer shot a protester, a protester set a man on fire and a third man died after reportedly being hit on the head by a brick.</p>
