      <p>Lionel Messi made a successful return to international football as Argentina gained a measure of revenge on Brazil for this summer’s Copa America semi-final defeat with a 1-0 win in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old was banned for three months by CONMEBOL after criticising the South American governing body, both after the semi-final loss and a third-place play-off win over Chile in which he was sent off following an altercation with Gary Medel.</p>
      <p>However, the Barcelona forward made a triumphant return as he scored the only goal of the game in an international friendly in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Gabriel Jesus hit a tame effort straight at Esteban Andrada after seven minutes, but moments later earned a penalty when he was fouled by Leandro Paredes in the area.</p>
      <p>The Manchester City striker took the spot-kick, only to fire wide from 12 yards in the 10th minute.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later Argentina were awarded a penalty of their own when Messi was tripped by Alex Sandro.</p>
      <p>Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker saved Messi’s spot-kick, but the Barcelona forward was left with a simple task to tap in the rebound.</p>
      <p>Good work by Willian on the left flank created a chance for Lucas Paqueta, but he dragged his shot wide.</p>
      <p>Messi could have doubled his tally a minute before half-time when he burst clear of the Brazil defence, but Alisson stood firm to save his low effort.</p>
      <p>Jesus and Willian both failed to work Andrada as Brazil sought an equaliser after the break, while at the other end Messi’s 66th-minute free-kick had to be tipped over by Alisson.</p>
      <p>Lautaro Martinez and Nicolas Otamendi both wasted late chances to make the game safe for Argentina, whose win represented a first against their arch rivals for more than two years.</p>
