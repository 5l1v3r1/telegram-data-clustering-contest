        <b>You might have thought Robert Downey Jr.’s time as Iron Man came to a close with <i>Endgame</i> but Disney+ have found away to bring him back to life. </b>

      <p>Now, don’t get too excited – when I say ‘bring him back to life’, unfortunately I don’t mean Iron Man himself somehow managed to survive the epic Avengers vs. Thanos war.</p>
      <p>Rather, the actor is apparently going to return to an animated version of the role for Disney’s recently launched streaming service.</p>

      <p>The news was revealed Jeff Goldblum during an interview with <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/11/15/iron-man-tony-stark-mcu-return-disney-what-if-series/"><i>Buzzfeed</i></a>, where he spoke about the upcoming Disney + series <i>What If…?</i></p>
      <p>The star is set to reprise a character of his own, <i>Thor: Ragnarok’s</i> Grandmaster, for the series and he will apparently also be joined by both Downey Jr. and Korg actor/<i>Ragnarok</i> director Taika Waititi.</p>

        <b>During the interview, Goldblum explained:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I played the part again a couple of days ago. I went to the Disney studios and I recorded the Grandmaster’s voice for an episode of a show that’s gonna be on Disney+ that’s called What If…?.<br/><br/>It’s an animated version of all the characters we know and love from Marvel and this episode included the Grandmaster and Iron Man, so Robert Downey will do a voice for that, and Korg, Taika Waititi had already recorded his voice for that, so yeah, for a couple hours I enjoyed doing that.</blockquote>
      <p>While Goldblum and Waititi were already known to be reprising their roles, Downey Jr.’s return comes as a surprise.</p>

      <p>The actor has certainly done his fair share for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having already played has played Tony Stark in<i> Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Avengers: Infinity War</i>, and <i>Avengers: Endgame.</i></p>
      <p>After all that, I suppose it’s only fitting that the star makes something of an appearance on the new streaming service, too.</p>

        <b>He continued:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>We’re talking about it, in fact, I hope so. I love Taika Waititi, he’s a great director and a friend of mine.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>What If…? is expected to premiere on Disney plus in Summer 2021, while Thor: Love and Thunder will hit theaters on November 5, 2021.</i>
