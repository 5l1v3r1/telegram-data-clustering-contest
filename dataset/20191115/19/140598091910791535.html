      <h1>Taylor Swift claims 'tyrannical' label execs stopped her performing some of her own songs at awards</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:46:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/rozina-sabur/" target="_blank">Rozina Sabur</a></address>
      <p>Taylor Swift said she has been stopped from performing her own songs at an awards ceremony by the "tyrannical control" of her former record label executives.</p>
      <p>The singer-songwriter said she had planned to play a medley of her hits at the American Music Awards on November 24, but the executives who own the music, Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta, would not allow it.</p>
      <p>"I just want to be able to perform MY OWN music. That's it," Swift said in a statement to her fans. "I've tried to work out this out privately through my team but have not been able to resolve anything."</p>
      <p>Swift said her performance at the award ceremony, an upcoming Netflix documentary about her career and any other recorded events she is planning to play in the near future are now a "question mark".</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/01/taylor-swift-sad-grossed-scooter-braun-acquires-back-catalogue/">previously spoken out about the sale of her back catalogu</a>e to Mr Braun, a music manager who bought them by acquiring Mr Borchetta's Big Machine Label Group in June.</p>

      <p>Swift said she had taken to publicly airing the dispute to increase awareness "for other artists and potentially help them avoid a similar fate".</p>
      <p>In a public plea to Mr Braun and Mr Borchetta's other artists, which includes Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber, Swift said: "I'm hoping that maybe they can talk some sense into the men who are exercising tyrannical control over someone who just wants to play the music she wrote."</p>
      <p>Swift also called on her legion of fans to put pressure on Mr Braun and Mr Borchetta to allow her performance and other projects to go forward.</p>
      <p>The Big Machine Label Group said in a statement Friday that "at no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere."</p>
