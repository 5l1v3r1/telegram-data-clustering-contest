      <p>The large-scale artworks, currently on display at the De La Salle University College of Law, Rufino Campus, were produced by student-artists from DLS-CSB Fashion Design and Merchandising and Production Design programs, under the guidance of Ramon Manuel De Leon. </p>
      <p>According to Benilde, the collection exemplifies precision on the craft and the five perceptual skills in illustration as applied to Portraiture: The Perception of Edges, Spaces, Relationships, Light and Shadows, and Gestalt. </p>
      <p>“Ang Tanda-Tanda Mo Na, Sinungaling Ka Pa Rin!” immortalizes the images of the individuals who, after speaking out during the dreaded period, have either gone missing, tortured. or killed. </p>
      <p>It aims to prevent historical revisionism and disprove the statement that no one was arrested and no one was executed during the Martial Law era—other than suspected drug lord Lim Seng—due to their political or religious beliefs or criticism on then-President Ferdinand Marcos. </p>
      <p>The exhibit is on view until Nov. 30 at the De La Salle University College of Law, Rufino Campus, 38th Street, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City.</p>
