      <p>Sam’s Club, like every other major retailer, will be taking part in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951389/black-friday-deals-best-tech-gadgets-walmart-amazon-target-how-to-save">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday 2019. It recently released its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fcontent%2Fblack-friday-catalog&amp;referrer=theverge.com">Black Friday ad</a>, and all of its deals will switch on at 7AM local time on Friday, November 29th.</p>
      <p>As far as what’s sticking out right now, Sam’s Club is back with the best-ever price on Vizio’s P-Series Quantum TV that we’ve seen yet. Also, Google Nest Hubs come in a two-pack that will sell for $129, the usual price for just a single smart display.</p>
      <p>We’ll update this post with any new noteworthy Black Friday deals from Sam’s Club that we stumble upon. Also, if there’s a markedly better deal happening at a different retailer, we’ll be sure to point you in the right direction.</p>
      <h3>Home entertainment</h3>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/32zLQuE">Vizio’s 65-inch P-Series Quantum X 4K HDR TV</a> (pictured above) will be $879. This is the best price we’ve seen yet for this high-end model, and it will be available online only. If you’re shopping for a TV, Vizio’s P-Series will be of interest if excellent picture quality, Apple AirPlay 2, and HomeKit support are must-have features for you. This TV is also very bright: it can reach a maximum of 3,000 nits, and it has 384 local dimming zones.</p>

      <p><a href="https://fave.co/379ig1A">LG’s 82-inch 4K HDR TV (model 8070PUA) will be $1,599</a>. It usually costs $1,799, and this TV comes with a <b>$150 Sam’s Club gift card</b>. This deal is available in-store and online, and it might be the best deal we’ll find on such a big TV this holiday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/32ToxLA">Sonos’ Beam soundbar will be $299</a>, which is the best price that we’ve seen. Other retailers will offer it for $319.</p>
      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2XitHiW">The Xbox One S All-Digital console will cost $149</a> (usually $249). This is the discless version of the console, and the deal will be online and in-store.</p>

      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2KtfGtQ">Nintendo’s Switch (the newer model with improved battery life) console includes several accessories and costs $334</a> (usually $389). This isn’t a price cut, but it’s a good deal if you want to gift the Switch with a bunch of accessories.</p>

      <h3>Misc.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2QmzKBN">Sam’s Club will offer two Google Nest Hub smart displays for $129</a>. It’s common that a single unit sells for $99, so getting two for just a little more is a steal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2Kr1KAj">Bose SoundSport Pulse wireless headphones will cost $99.88</a>, which is $30 off of its usual price.</p>
