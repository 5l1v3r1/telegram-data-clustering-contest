      <p>Furious commuters blasted rail chiefs today after a woman paying £6,000 a year for a season ticket was fined for standing with just one foot in a 1st class carriage.</p>
      <p>The un-named commuter was stopped by a ticket inspector on the Greater Anglia Trains Liverpool Street to Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, service.</p>
      <p>The train was packed full with commuters leaving the woman no other choice but to stand by the doorway with her a single foot in the compartment.</p>
      <p>She was confronted by the inspector in front of astonished commuters when the train stopped in Shenfield, a suburb of Brentwood, Essex. <br/><br/>Taking to Twitter, other commuters vented their frustrations at the treatment of the woman.</p>
      <p>Ben Cooper tweeted: "Someone is trying to charge a woman for having STOOD in the doorway of first class on packed train and I’m about to blow my f***ing top.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Katie Burnell tweeted the Greater Anglia train service to say: "The ticket inspectors on the 18:35 LST- Clacton on Sea are behaving like bullies.</p>
      <p>"A woman is being charged a fine that is completely shocking - she stood one foot in 1st class in a packed carriage.</p>
      <p>"Something needs to be done. They've cornered her. Camera in the carriage needs to have the footage reviewed. SHE DID NOTHING WRONG.</p>
      <p>"I wish the inspectors used common sense. Truly shocking behaviour."</p>
      <p>A third commuter, Georgie Smith, commented: "Absolutely disgusting behaviour from a ticket inspector on @greateranglia service who is issuing a woman a fine for daring to stand with ONE FOOT in first class despite the train being so busy no one could move.</p>
      <p>"She pays £6,000 for a season ticket.</p>
      <p>"Glad she had the support of many people who didn’t just stand by though."</p>
      <p>Speaking of the conductors, she said: "They actually get commission and have targets to hit, so “just following orders” doesn’t seem valid to me."</p>
      <p>Another commuter added: "I think Greater Anglia should be ashamed of themselves, these trains get so packed you have no option. DISGRACEFUL."</p>
      <p>Greater Anglia, which has been criticised for delays and packed trains, today remained unrepentant.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: “First class carriages, including the vestibules and aisles, are for the use of first class ticket holders only.</p>
      <p>"Our revenue protection officer advised the customer there was more space available further down the train.</p>
      <p>“If the customer would like to appeal the penalty fare, they can do so via IRCAS.</p>
      <p>"We would encourage her to contact us direct if she is unhappy with how the situation was handled.</p>
      <p>“Passengers must have the correct ticket for the time and class of their journey when travelling on one of our trains.”</p>
