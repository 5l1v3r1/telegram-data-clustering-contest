      <h1>Giant ‘immersive’ poop theater coming to NYC next month</h1>

      <p>This new theater will be a real piece of crap.</p>
      <p>A “fully immersive” 30-foot-wide by 30-foot-tall inflatable poop emoji-shaped theater is coming to New York next month.</p>
      <p>Sponsored by <a href="https://www.poopourri.com/collections/giant-poo">Poo-Pourri Before-You-Go Toilet Spray</a>, the <a href="https://www.giantpoo.com/">Giant Poo</a> tour promises attendees an “experience that pushes out the bad s – – t, makes room for the good s – – t and leaves you feeling like THE s – – t,” according to its event description.</p>
      <p>A video projection will play inside the feces structure, thanks to a partnership with augmented reality and animation studio Flight School and projection specialists Omnispace 360.</p>
      <p>The giant dung heap began its national tour on Oct. 10 in Texas before making its way to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Las Vegas and, from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/481941055868074/">Dec. 13 to 15</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/426910578010442/">20 to 22</a>, NYC — the exact location is pending. In all, this s – – t will visit over 22 cities before making its way back to its hometown of Dallas in May 2020.</p>
      <p>The vision for the interactive excrement came from Poo-Pourri founder and CEO Suzy Batiz. The giant poo, she says, is all one big metaphor.</p>
      <p>“I started thinking about the concept of letting s – – t go and how there’s a psychological component,” says Batiz in a promotional <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B368Pk7n9BQ/">video</a>. The Giant Poo experience helps guests release the “constipation” of toxic thoughts, she says.</p>
