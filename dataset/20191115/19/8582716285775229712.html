      <p><b>NEW YORK — </b>Britain’s Prince Andrew says he doesn’t remember a woman who has accused him of sexually exploiting her in encounters arranged by Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Andrew tells the BBC in an interview scheduled to be broadcast Saturday that he has “no recollection” of meeting Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who says Epstein paid her $15,000 after she had sex with Andrew in 2001 when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Andrew has made similar denials for years but has come under new pressure following Epstein’s arrest and suicide last summer.</p>
      <p>Giuffre has produced a photo showing her posing with the prince in London.</p>
      <p>The BBC on Friday released excerpts from its interview with Andrew.</p>
      <p>Andrew also said he regrets not cutting ties with Epstein after the financier was convicted in 2008 of sex crimes involving teenage girls.</p>
