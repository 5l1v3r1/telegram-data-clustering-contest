      <p>Globe and ABS-CBN Foundation Inc. have joined forces to advocate for the health and safety of all Filipino children by offering toll-free calls to Bantay Bata #163 helpline for all Globe and TM mobile phone users beginning November 18, 2019.</p>

      <p>Through the recent signing of a memorandum of agreement, the two parties will be able to strengthen the efforts of Bantay Bata in protecting disadvantaged and at-risk children through a nationwide network of social services such  rescue and rehabilitation, training and advocacy on child abuse prevention, rehabilitation of families in crisis, educational scholarships, community outreach and medical and dental missions.</p>
      <p>By making Bantay Bata #163 toll-free for all Globe and TM customers, it will become easier and safer to report, rescue and rehabilitate sick and abused children. Dialing the helpline also means hope for Filipino children and their families who are suffering in silence due to child abuse.  </p>
      <p>Currently, children and youth in the Philippines continue to face huge challenges. According to last year's report on the Situation Analysis of Children in the Philippines,  2 in 3 children experienced physical violence, 2 in 5 from psychological violence, 1 in 4 from sexual violence, and 2 in 3 from peer violence. Worse, violence against children often takes place at home.</p>
      <p>"The ABS-CBN Foundation Inc. is happy to connect with Globe to help in creating swifter communication for the Bantay Bata program. By making #163 toll-free, it will be easier for more concerned citizens to report child abuse right away. The installation of Globe Prepaid WIFIs in all Bantay Bata regional offices will also help change the way we get updates, making it easier to coordinate in various areas and offices", says Jing Castaneda Velasco, Program Director of Bantay Bata 163.</p>
      <p>“Globe has been leading the Philippines to become a digital nation while building ecosystems benefiting individuals, families, and businesses.  Globe Business, for instance, has revolutionized enterprises by making them digitally accessible to their customers through the toll-free #hotline solution. Now, the same technology that we offer to companies can be used to protect Filipino children against all forms of violence," said Albert de Larrazabal, Globe Chief Commercial Officer. "We are glad to work with ABS-CBN Foundation and we are one with them in the vision to build a safe Philippines and to protect the youth by making Bantay Bata #163 accessible through our network for free."</p>
      <p>Globe will provide connectivity and communication support to the Bantay Bata  Children’s Village and their regional offices —such as The Children's Village in Norzagaray, Bulacan and Bantay Bata Regional Offices in Laguna, Cebu, Iloilo, Bicol, Negros, Zamboanga, Davao — where rescued Bantay Bata Hotline 163 kids are taken.</p>
      <p>ABS-CBN Foundation is an advocate for public service in strategic sectors of Philippine society. It aims to awaken hope in the Filipino through implementing projects via multi-sectoral partnerships in the spirit of bayanihan. It has three major programs: Bantay Bata 163, Bantay Kalikasan, and Sagip Kapamilya.</p>
      <p>As a purpose-led organization, Globe seeks to contribute to nation-building by combining innovation and technology with the power of collaboration, to achieve inclusive and sustainable development for all.  Through the years, Globe has looked after the welfare of the Filipino youth through its various programs and advocacies on cyberwellness, education, mental health, and anti-piracy, among others.</p>
      <p>Aside from Bantay Bata 163, Globe has also partnered with SAGIP Kapamilya, providing relief goods to affected families during disasters. </p>
