      <p>The winners of the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards have been announced, with Untitled Goose Game and Control both picking up awards.</p>
      <p>If The Game Awards have become the video game equivalent of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/oscars/">Oscars</a> then the Golden Joysticks are the MTV Awards. They’re voted on by the public and this year 3.5 million people cast their vote in 19 different categories.</p>
      <p>This was the 37th Golden Joysticks, so they’ve been going for over three decades now, although as you might imagine they didn’t used to be livestreamed on Twitch and YouTube, like they are now.</p>
      <p>You can see all the winners below but it was Resident Evil 2 that walked (shambled?) off with the Ultimate Game of the Year award, as well as being one of only two games to win more than one award – as it also won for Best Audio.</p>

      <p>Days Gone won PlayStation Game of the Year and, quite inexplicably, Best Storytelling. Which makes no sense to us as the storytelling was one of the worst parts of an already mediocre game.</p>

      <p>Other than that though, most of the winners seemed quite sensible, with OutRun and Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki honoured with a Lifetime Achievement award and Cyberpunk 2077 being named as the Most Wanted Game for 2019.</p>
