      <p>Below you can see a price chart of the common stock, ALL:</p>

      <p>The company has currently paid (for the last 4 quarters) a dividend of $1.96 on its common stock. With a market price of $106.20, the current yield of ALL is 1.84%. As an absolute value, this means it has a $652.89M dividend expense. For comparison, the yearly dividend for all outstanding preferred stocks (with the newly issued Series I preferred stock) of the company is around $121.31M.</p>
      <p>In addition, with a market capitalization of around $34.67B, ALL is one of the biggest Property &amp; Casualty Insurance companies (according to Finviz.com).</p>

        <i>Source: Morningstar.com |Company's Balance Sheet</i>
      </p>
      <p>As of Q3 2019, ALL had a total debt of $6.63B ranking senior to the newly issued preferred stock. The new Series I preferred shares rank junior to all outstanding debt and equal to the other outstanding preferred stocks, which total $3.05B.</p>

          <b>The Ratios Of Allstate Which We Should Care About</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Our purpose today is not to make an investment decision regarding the common stock of ALL but to find out if its new preferred stock has the need quality to be part of our portfolio. Here is the moment where I want to remind you of two important aspects of the preferred stocks compared to the common stocks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preferred shareholders have priority over a company's income, meaning they are paid dividends before common shareholders.</li>
        <li>Common stockholders are last in line when it comes to company assets, which means they will be paid out after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on our research and experience, these are the most important metrics we use when comparing preferred stocks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Market Cap/(Long-term debt + Preferreds)</b>: This is our main criterion when determining credit risk. <b>The bigger the ratio, the safer the preferred</b><i>.</i> Based on the latest annual report and taking into consideration the latest preferred issue, we have a ratio of 34,670/(6,630 + 3,350) = <b>3.47</b>, indicating the company is extremely well-capitalized, as its equity is enough to cover all its debt and preferred stocks.</li>
        <li><b>Earnings/(Debt and Preferred Payments):</b> This is also quite easy to understand approach. One can use EBITDA instead of earnings, but we prefer to have our buffer in what is left to the common stockholder. <b>The higher this ratio, the better</b>. The ratio with the 2018 financial results is 2,810/(330 + 121) = <b>6.23</b>, also indicating a significant buffer for the preferred stockholders and the bondholders so to be calm about the payments. Moreover, the company manages to pay more than $652M dividend expense for its common that is junior to its liabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>The Allstate Family</b>
      </p>
      <p>The company has 3 more outstanding preferred stocks, a baby bond, and a third-party security:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allstate Corp. 5.625% Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Series A (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALL.PA">ALL.PA</a>)</li>
        <li>Allstate Corp. 5.10% Fixed-To-Floating Rate Subordinated Debentures due 1/15/2053 (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALL.PB">ALL.PB</a>)</li>
        <li>Allstate Corp. 5.625% Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Series G (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALL.PG">ALL.PG</a>)</li>
        <li>Allstate Corp 5.10% Fixed Rate Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series H (ALL.PH)</li>
        <li>Synthetic Fixed-Income Sec STRATS 2006-03 Floating Rate Allstate Corp. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GJT">GJT</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <i>Source: Author's database</i>
      </p>
      <p>Here is also the time to mention the company's intention to use the proceeds from the offering of the new Series I Preferred stock to repurchase "certain of its preferred stock". As you can be seen from the table, ALL.PA is the most probable candidate, it is already callable, the proceeds are enough for the whole feed and that would save the company an annual rate of 0.925%.</p>
      <p>As for the rest of ALL's preferred stocks, the most recently issued ALL.PG and ALL.PH are the only suitable for comparison. With its 4.77% CY, ALL-I rewards a little more than the maximum you could realize if you choose the Series H Preferred Stock and a bit more if you choose the Series G. However, it is the issue with the lowest nominal fixed dividend rate, which means it is the most vulnerable from subsequent rate hikes. However, we are entering a low rate environment and a good yield can hardly be found without taking higher credit risk.</p>
      <p>In addition, in the following chart, you can see a comparison between ALL's fixed-income securities and the fixed-income securities benchmark, the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFF">PFF</a>). Except for the most recently issued ALL.PH, the rest of the preferred stocks and the baby bond are trading close to the benchmark, while the Series G Preferred stock is outperforming the whole group. As for GJT, as a TRuPS, it lives in his own world.</p>

      </p>
      <p>I understand this is not perfect (the maturity of the bond is slightly longer than the call date of ALL-I), but, for the purpose of this comparison, I choose the 2026 bond, ALL4432908. ALL4432908, as it is the FINRA ticker, matures two years later than ALL.PH becomes callable and has a Yield-to-Maturity of 2.285%. This should be compared to the 4.94% Yield-to-Call of ALL-I, but when making that comparison, do remember that ALL-I's YTC is the maximum you could realize if you hold the preferred stock until 2024. That translates into a yield spread of 2.65% between the two securities.</p>
      <p>Some more information about the bond can be found in the chart below.</p>

          <b>Sector Comparison</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The charts below contain all preferred stocks in the "Property &amp; Casualty Insurance" sector (according to Finviz.com) that pay a fixed dividend rate, has a par value of $25, and a positive Yield-to-Call. It is important to take note that all of these preferred stocks are eligible for the 15% federal tax rate.</p>
      <p>By Yield-to-Call and Current Yield:</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <i>Source: Author's database</i>
      </p>
      <p>Most of the preferred stocks in the sector are trading above their par value, and the Current yield is, in fact, their Yield-to-Best. That's why the best way to compare the group is by their Yield-to-Worst (equal to their Yield-to-Call). This is a much more plausible Yield curve. Two more filters will be added, the security must not be callable and must bear an S&amp;P rating.</p>
      <p>By Years-to-Call and Yield-to-Call:</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <i>Source: Author's database</i>
      </p>
      <p>With its 4.94%, ALL-I gives a more than the average Yield-to-Worst of 4.03%. However, by adding the fact, it is the lower yielder, as in the family, the superiority does not seem so significant. Still, the ALL's preferred stock gives one of the lowest returns, due to the lower credit risk for its holders.</p>
      <p>Here is a list of all fixed-rate preferred stocks with a positive YTC:</p>

      <p>To see how the real Yield curve of these securities looks like, we'll have to include two more conditions: the preferred stocks don't have to be callable and have to trade above par value. The next chart will present the BBB preferred stocks by their Years-to-Call and Yield-to-Call:</p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>The Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. We may, at our option, redeem the shares of Preferred Stock (I) in whole but not in part at any time prior to January 15, 2025 within 90 days after the occurrence of a <b>"rating agency event"</b> <b>at a redemption price equal to</b> $25,500 per share (equivalent to <b>$25.50 per Depositary Share</b>), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without regard to any undeclared dividends, to, but excluding, the redemption date, or (II) (A) in whole but not in part at any time prior to January 15, 2025, within 90 days after the occurrence of a <b>"regulatory capital event</b>," or (B) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after January 15, 2025, in each case, <b>at a redemption price equal to</b> $25,000 per share (equivalent to <b>$25 per Depositary Share</b>), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without regard to any undeclared dividends, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If we become subject to capital regulation and the Preferred Stock is included in our regulatory capital, the redemption of the Preferred Stock may be subject to our receipt of any required prior approval from a capital regulator of ours and to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in applicable capital rules and any other regulations of such capital regulator.</blockquote>

      <p>
        <b><b>Addition to the</b> <i>ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred &amp; Hybrid Securities Index</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>With the current market capitalization of the new issue of around $300M, ALL-I is a possible addition to the <i>ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred &amp; Hybrid Securities Index</i> during some of the next rebalancings. It will also be included in the holdings of the main benchmark, <i>the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF</i> which is the ETF that seeks to track the investment results of this index, and which is important to us due to its influence on the behavior of all fixed-income securities. I'll just remind you about the last year rally in the fixed-income borne from the redemption of the two "giants" HSEA and HSEB and the released cash of over $600M used from PFF to buy more of the rest of its holdings.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Conclusion</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>As fixed-income traders, we follow every one preferred stock or baby bond, which is listed on the stock exchange. As such, <b>ALL-I</b> is no exception, and the homework we always do we share it with the public. It is not necessary for the IPO to be an arbitrage and a bargain but in many cases, the new security happens to be better than the ones already trading on the market.</p>
      <p>The company is well leveraged, having 3.5x more equity than long-term debt. With a market cap of $34B, ALL is one of the biggest insurance companies and with the $652M common stock dividend, it is 6x times more than what it will be paid to the preferred stockholders (in case the company leaves "A" preferred shares outstanding). Its interest coverage for 2018 is also quite good with a ratio of 6.23, and again, in case the potential redemptions don't get called.</p>
      <p>As for the ALL-I, it is another preferred stock to be issued at a rate below the 5% threshold. Along with JPM-J, NTRSO, and PSB-Z, it is the fourth one just for a period of two weeks with such low nominal yield. When compared to its "relatives" from the company, it gives slightly better YTW at the cost to be the lowest nominal issue. A look further also shows the new preferred stock a little better, when it comes to YTW than the rest from the sector and all other BBB rated ones. A new IPO at the psychological boundary of 5% sounds a little scary, especially if it is one of the best investment grade stocks, currently. I believe the new preferred stock is from a great quality but as a return is just not enough. Overall, because of its high vulnerability, the newly issued preferred stock does not fit into my interest.</p>
