      <h1>2020 Honda HR-V Is The Biggest Little Crossover You Can Buy</h1>
      <h2>Honda says it has class-leading cargo space.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:35:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Honda has just revealed the updated <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/honda/hr-v">2020 HR-V</a>, which features a few key pricing and feature updates. Just like the 2019 model, the only engine option is a 1.8-liter i-VTEC four-cylinder producing 141 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque sent to the front or all four wheels via a CVT. Sadly, Honda<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/2019-honda-hr-v-gains-sport-trim-but-loses-stick-shift"> killed off the HR-V's manual transmission</a> in the 2019 model year. And in a second straight year of disappointment, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/honda-needs-to-bring-this-turbocharged-hr-v-to-the-us">1.5-liter turbocharged engine </a>available on the European model won't be offered in the United States.</p>
      <p>But our disappointment comes mostly from an enthusiast point of view. For the average car buyer, the HR-V remains one of the best options in the sub-compact crossover segment. In fact, the HR-V offers up to 24.3 cubic feet of storage in the trunk (58.8 with the seats folded), giving it class-leading cargo capacity.</p>

      <p>The 2020 HR-V carries over the same trim levels from 2019: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring. All of these trim levels feature new headlights and revised bumpers, grille and taillights carried over from the 2019 refresh. The Honda Sensing suite of safety features comes standard on all trim levels from EX and above, adding adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation braking, forward collision warning, lane keep assist, road departure mitigation, and lane departure warning (LDW).</p>
      <p>Honda says the 2020 HR-V has already earned a five-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and is targeting a Top Safety Pick rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</p>
