      <p>The latest trailer for <i>One-Punch Man: A Hero Nobody</i> knows confirms the fighting game will be released this February, while showcasing a new game mode that has fighters freeze in awe whenever the world's top-ranked hero King appears to observe a battle.

      <p>Dubbed "Dream Version Saitama," the pajama-clad incarnation of the hero can be knocked around by his opponents in direct contrast to the actual hero, who is completely unfazed by enemy attacks.</p>
      <p>In addition to the new fighters and game mode, the trailer also reveals Metal Knight, Melzargard and Stinger all in explosive action, capturing the fast-paced combat and robust sense of humor that has endeared the anime series to millions of fans all over the world.</p>
