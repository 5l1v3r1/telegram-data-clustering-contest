      <p>A moving equipment and storage rental company has been fined more than $71,000 after workers found asbestos-containing material in a Kamloops commercial building.</p>
      <p>WorkSafeBC officials inspected a U-Haul Co. Canada Ltd. commercial building in Kamloops that was under renovation, according to a penalty report posted online last month.</p>
      <p>At the time of the inspection, workers were removing drywall — a potential asbestos-containing material — from the wall and ceiling, the report said.</p>
      <p>WorkSafeBC said no hazardous materials survey had been conducted and it issued a stop-work order. A survey conducted later confirmed the drywall compound as an asbestos-containing material.</p>
      <p>The firm failed to ensure that a qualified person inspected the building to identify hazardous materials before workers began renovations work, WorkSafeBC said.</p>
      <p>This was a high risk violation and the firm was fined $71,247.36 on Oct. 9.</p>
      <p>WorkSafeBC said in an emailed statement it would not disclose the location of the building due to privacy reasons.</p>
