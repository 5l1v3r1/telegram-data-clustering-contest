      <p>Louis Healy has been confirmed as Sarah Sugden's secret love interest on Emmerdale .</p>
      <p>Denise Welch's son joined the ITV soap in September as Danny, Sarah's school classmate.</p>
      <p>However tonight, it emerged that the pair appeared to be more than just friends when they secretly met up.</p>
      <p>While speaking to an angry Charity, Sarah received a text from someone called Danny and she smiled to herself.</p>
      <p>Later, viewers watched as Sarah met with Danny, who was waiting in the graveyard.</p>

      <p>"I wasn't sure you'd come," he said as he greeted her.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't wait to get out of the house," she replied. "My gran's in a right mood."</p>
      <p>He asked: "What's wrong?"</p>
      <p>Avoiding revealing that Cain had got his own son kidnapped as a result of his carjacking plan, she replied wryly: "You wouldn't believe me even if I told you. Bottom line is, she can do some crazy stuff."</p>

      <p>"Yeah, I kind of noticed she was a bit... weird," Danny said.</p>
      <p>"And that was her on her best behaviour," Sarah replied. "If you saw what she was really like she'd scare you off."</p>
      <p>"No chance," Danny said. "It's you I've come to see. Not your gran."</p>
      <p>He then leaned in for a kiss... how will Sarah's mum react when she finds out her daughter is secretly dating?</p>
