      <h2>Actresses June Diane Raphael and Marg Helgenberger were also arrested.</h2>

      <p>Jane Fonda continued her crusade in Washington, D.C. on Friday, leading a protest over climate change at the U.S. Capitol, marking the actress' sixth "Fire Drill Friday."</p>
      <p>This time, she was joined by Abigail Disney and Robert Kennedy Jr., among others, including actresses June Diane Raphael and Marg Helgenberger, for a sit-in.</p>
      <p>RFK Jr., Raphael and Helgenberger were <a href="https://twitter.com/FireDrillFriday/status/1195414243341950978">arrested</a> along with others; all likely to be charged with crowding and obstructing or incommoding. It is unclear if Disney was arrested. </p>
      <p>However, Fonda once again avoided arrest, as she did last week, because her stay in jail could have been a month. </p>

      <p>Last week's protest started at the Capitol and ended outside the White House. There were no arrests. Fonda was joined then by Ben &amp; Jerry’s co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield.</p>
      <p>Fonda previously spent a night in jail after she was arrested a fourth time.</p>
      <p>Fonda has been a political activist for decades and a staunch opponent of oil industry developments.</p>
      <p>Fonda made it clear she plans on getting arrested while protesting as many times as it takes to get her climate change point across.</p>
