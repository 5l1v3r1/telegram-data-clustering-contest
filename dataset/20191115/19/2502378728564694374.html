      <h3>The rapper put her knees to work for the 'Queen &amp; Slim' soundtrack song with NOLA bounce artist VickeeLo</h3>
      <p>Megan Thee Stallion may be known for repping her hometown of Houston, but <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/megan-thee-stallion-vickeelo-ride-or-die-video-queen-and-slim-soundtrack">for her new song</a>, "Ride or Die," the rapper teamed up with artist VickeeLo for a New Orleans bounce track that will be bumping in the club for months.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>"Ride or Die" is off the <i>Queen &amp; Slim </i>soundtrack, the <a href="https://nylon.com/queen-slim-new-trailer">Black Bonnie and Clyde-style love story starring Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith</a>. The video for the aptly-named track features <a href="https://nylon.com/megan-thee-stallion-interview">Megan putting her famous knees to work</a> as she, VickeeLo, and a gaggle of Hot Girls bounce in the club and the streets of New Orleans.</p>
      <p>Megan Thee Stallion is closing out a whirlwind year that included <a href="https://nylon.com/hot-girl-summer-megan-stallion">her catchphrase "Hot Girl Summer" getting trademarked</a> after becoming corporate America's new favorite slogan. Her rap credentials have remained spotless as she's teamed up with peers like DaBaby to create hits.</p>
      <p>In addition to Megan, the <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0tKvSA7Nzbif8C00lV5sQp">Queen &amp; Slim </a></i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0tKvSA7Nzbif8C00lV5sQp">soundtrack</a> is stacked with artists of the moment, including Blood Orange, Vince Staples, Burna Boy, 6LACK, Mereba, and The Internet's Syd.</p>
