      <h1>Why did Facebook block pro-vaccination ads and run anti-vaccination ads? Money!</h1>

      <p>Thanks for the measles outbreaks, Facebook.</p>
      <p>The social media platform refused to run pro-vaccination ads on the grounds that they were "political" but not labeled as such, "while simultaneously allowing hundreds of advertisements from anti-vaccination groups to display for millions of users," reports <a href="https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/11/14/facebook-let-anti-vaxxers-run-rampant-with-misinformation-ads-because-money/">TNW</a>. The upshot? "Medical experts claim that Facebook has played a major role in the resurgence of the measles virus and blame the social media networkâ€™s declaration that all advertisements concerning vaccinations were political in nature."</p>
