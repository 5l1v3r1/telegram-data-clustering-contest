      <p>You ever dream of waking up <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/christmas">Christmas Day</a> and instead of a stocking stuffed with trinkets and treats, it was just filled to the brim with lukewarm, viscous <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink">ranch dressing</a>? Because you don’t have to dream anymore – Hidden Valley has made it a reality! A slightly tangy, slightly sweet reality.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The brand, which has released Ranch-themed apparel and accessories before, has launched a new limited-edition stocking that is filled with 52 ounces of Hidden Valley Original Ranch Dressing just in time for the holidays.</p>

      <p>The stocking is part of the 12 days of ranch-mas and features cartoon bottles of Ranch, as well as burgers and pizza. Down at the toe is a “functional pour spout” that allows ranch enthusiasts – and assuming Santa himself – to access the condiment.</p>
