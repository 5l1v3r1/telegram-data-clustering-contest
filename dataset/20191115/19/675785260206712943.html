      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</a> starts this weekend with a star-studded line-up set to enter the jungle and compete for the crown over the next three weeks.</p>
      <p>But what are the stars of the show paid in return for three weeks of humiliation, near-starvation and taking part in gruesome Bushtucker trials?</p>
      <p>You might be surprised by just how little - or how much - some of the celebrities earn from their stint in the jungle.</p>
      <p>A TV insider has confessed to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10293217/im-a-celebrity-rich-list-million-line-up/">The Sun</a> that ITV bosses have splurged over £1.4 million on the 2019 line-up, with Caitlyn Jenner reportedly banking the most with a whopping £500,000 fee.</p>

      <p>The world's most famous transgender woman, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> , is rumoured to be the highest paid contestant ever.</p>
      <p>ITV bosses have reportedly forked out nearly £500,000 on the global sensation, with hopes she will 'tell all' about her famous former Kardashian lifestyle and messy split with ex-wife Kris Jenner.</p>
      <p>Topping the show's rich list with a half-a-million pay packet, Caitlyn, 70, is set to be TV gold as she opens up about life inside Hollywood's most famous family.</p>

      <p>Former Girls Aloud singer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nadine-coyle">Nadine Coyle</a> has reportedly bagged a quarter of a million to sign up for I'm A Celebrity.</p>

      <p>The Sun claims that the lowest paid celebs of the series are two of the youngest - Myles Stephenson and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/roman-kemp">Roman Kemp</a> .</p>
      <p>The Capital FM DJ, 26, may have a famous family, but is thought to be earning £40,000 for his jungle adventure.</p>
      <p>At the bottom of the pay cheques is Rak-Su singer Myles.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> winner, 28, is estimated to earn £25,000 for his appearance on the ITV show.</p>

      <p>The celebs have already jetted into Australia and are on strict lock down before heading into the jungle when the show begins this Sunday.</p>
      <p>The future campmates all met on yacht together recently, where they were handed yummy cocktails and plenty of opportunities for showbiz meet-and-greet kisses.</p>
      <p>The gang looked to have hit it off with them all pictured with smiles on their faces ahead of their entry into the jungle.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity reps declined to comment when approached by the Mirror Online.</p>
      <p>
        <b>*I'm A Celebrity starts on ITV this Sunday at 9pm.</b>
