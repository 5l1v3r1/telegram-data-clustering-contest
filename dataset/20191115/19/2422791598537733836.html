      <p>GATINEAU, Que. -- Twenty-one elementary school students in Gatineau were taken to hospital today after complaining of head, chest and stomach aches following a school bus ride.</p>
      <p>Maude Hebert with the Portages-de-l'Outaouais school board says no one showed signs of serious injury and the children were brought to hospital as a preventive measure.</p>
      <p>She says when the students arrived at school, they complained they felt ill and reported an unusual smell from the bus.</p>
      <p>Hebert says carbon monoxide has been ruled out as a cause, and authorities are investigating whether a problem with the exhaust gas cooler on the bus emitted the foul odour.</p>
      <p>Marie-Eve D'Aoust, spokeswoman for the paramedics co-operative that treated the children, says 17 patients were brought to the Gatineau hospital and four were transported to the Hull hospital.</p>
      <p>She says 22 other students evaluated by paramedics and poison control workers did not need to be taken to hospital.</p>
