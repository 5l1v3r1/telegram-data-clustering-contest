      <p>The beast carried out sex attacks on his child victims between 1991 and 2015 at various addresses in the town.</p>
      <p>And he also battered two women in Fife between 1998 and 2019.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland Detectives began a probe into dangerous Kerr after a woman reported non-recent sexual abuse he had subjected her to.</p>
      <p>He was then arrested and charged on June 6 this year.</p>
      <p>An investigating officer hailed the victims who came forward to help police, and called Kerr a “predatory” and “dangerous” man.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Karen Nairn from Fife’s Public Protection Unit said: “James Kerr is a dangerous and predatory individual who subjected these children to horrific levels of sexual abuse and also subjected two women to serious physical violence.</p>
      <p>“I would like to commend the victims who bravely came forward and assisted the police.</p>
      <p>“His guilty plea is testament to the evidence they provided and the investigative work carried out by officers in the Public Protection Unit.</p>
      <p>“We treat all reports of sexual crime – no matter when the offence happened – with the utmost professionalism and sensitivity to bring perpetrators of such crimes to justice.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who has been subjected to abuse should feel confident in coming forward, that we will believe you and will thoroughly investigate.”</p>
