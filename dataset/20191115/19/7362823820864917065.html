      <h1>'James Bond' actor Daniel Craig says he's an American while promoting new movie</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies/james-bond">James Bond</a> actor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Daniel Craig</a> called himself “an American” while promoting his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies">latest film</a>, prompting many to wonder if the man famous for playing Britain’s greatest spy has obtained his citizenship.</p>
      <p>Craig plays a detective in the movie "Knives Out." In it, his character is tasked with solving a murder that touches upon issues of white privilege and race. Speaking to People at the film’s premiere in Los Angeles, Craig talked about the themes and conspicuously dropped a hint about his status in the United States.</p>

      <p>“Everyone is an immigrant in this country,” <a href="https://people.com/movies/daniel-craig-says-hes-american-years-after-wife-rachel-weisz-attained-her-u-s-citizenship/">he said</a>. “I’m an immigrant. I’m an American. We’re all immigrants.”</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old star was born in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">United Kingdom</a> but seems to be implying that he’s obtained a U.S. citizenship.</p>

      <p>Craig wouldn’t be the first in his household to obtain U.S. citizenship. His wife, actress <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rachel-weisz-to-play-elizabeth-taylor-in-biopic">Rachel Weisz</a>, 49, became an American citizen in 2011, the outlet reports. The duo got married in June of that year and welcomed their first daughter in 2018.</p>
      <p>“I did it because I thought I would go back to England for a while, and lose my green card,” she told <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/interview-rachel-weisz/16697">Stylist</a> in 2012. “I’m not going back now, but being a citizen means I can vote here, which is exciting; not just being an outsider. When I come back into the country now and they stamp my passport, they say, ‘Welcome home, ma’am.’ I think that’s a lovely formality. No one in England would ever say that, would they?”</p>
