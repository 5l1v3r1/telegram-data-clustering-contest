      <p>Ophidiophobia, or fear of snakes, is common among humans. We avoid snakes in the wild, have nightmares about snakes at night, and recoil at snakes on television. We might even be born with the aversion. When researchers <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01710/full">showed babies</a> photos of snakes and spiders, their tiny pupils dilated, indicating an arousal response to these ancestral threats.</p>
      <p>If you really want to scare a baby, show them footage of an Australian tree snake. Thanks to researchers at Virginia Tech, we now know these non-venomous snakes of the genus <i>Dendrelaphis</i> can become airborne, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/11/jumping-flying-snakes-australia-evolution/">propelling</a> themselves around treetops like sentient Silly String.</p>

      <p>That’s <i>Dendrelaphis pictus</i>, which was caught zipping through the air in 2010. After looking at footage previously filmed by her advisor <a href="https://www.thesochalab.org/">Jake Socha</a>, Virginia Tech Ph.D. candidate Michelle Graham headed for Australia and built a kind of <i>American Ninja Warrior</i> course for snakes out of PVC piping and tree branches. Graham observed that the snakes tend to spot their landing target, then spring upward. The momentum gets them across gaps that would otherwise not be practical to cross.</p>
      <p>Graham next plans to investigate why snakes feel compelled to jump. They might feel a need to escape, or continue moving, or do it because they can. Two scientific papers due in 2020 could provide answers.</p>
      <p><i>Dendrelaphis</i> isn’t the only kind of snake with propulsive capabilities. The <i>Chrysopelea</i> genus includes five species found in Southeast Asia and China, among other places, that can <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/just-to-let-you-know-tree-snakes-in-australia-can-jump-/">glide</a> through the air.</p>
