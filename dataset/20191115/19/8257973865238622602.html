      <h1>FDA warns Dollar Tree for importing unsafe drugs from China</h1>

      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- Discount retailer Dollar Tree has been warned by the U.S. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Food_and_Drug_Administration/?tps=1">Food and Drug Administration</a> that some of its over-the-counter drugs are coming from from suspect foreign manufacturers.</p>
      <p>The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/greenbrier-international-inc-dba-dollar-tree-574706-11062019">sent a letter</a> to Dollar Tree saying that some of its pharmaceutical products -- sold under the name Assured Brands -- were supplied by Chinese firms with a "pattern of serious violations" of U.S. law.</p>
      <p>"FDA inspections of these foreign facilities revealed significant violations of current good manufacturing practice," the warning letter, dated Nov. 6, states.</p>
      <p>The FDA cited a recent inspection of a Chinese factory at which an acne treatment product was manufactured, and said inspectors there found failures to "conduct component identity testing" and "test each batch of drug for objectionable micro-organisms prior to distribution."</p>
      <p>The agency also noted an inspection visit to China-based Bicooya Cosmetics, where officials found the company wasn't testing finished drug products or looking for evidence of rodent droppings at the manufacturing facility.</p>
      <p>Randy Guiler, Dollar Tree's vice president of investor relations, responded with a pledge for product quality.</p>
      <p>"We are committed to our customers' safety and have very robust and rigorous testing programs in place to ensure our third-party manufacturers' products are safe," he said.</p>
      <p>Dollar Tree told the FDA it wouldn't buy products from any company targeted by U.S. regulators. The agency, however, said that was "not always the case," Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dollar-tree-accused-of-importing-unsafe-drugs-despite-fda-warning-2019-11">reported Friday</a>.</p>
