      <p><b>Square</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/sq-stock-quote/"><b><u>SQ</u></b></a>) stock has been moving sideways in the last few months as markets have become concerned about the stock’s  valuation.</p>

      <p>Square stock does trade at an expensive forward price earnings ratio of 66. However, I still believe that SQ stock will likely climb much higher after a period of consolidation. The company’s top-line growth has decelerated on a relative basis, but it still remains healthy.</p>
      <p>Further, SQ has enough  growth triggers to justify a premium valuation for SQ stock.</p>
      <p>One of the positive catalysts of  SQ stock is the company’s Cash App. In Q3, Cash App generated total revenue of $307 million and gross profit of $123 million.</p>
      <p>Excluding Bitcoin revenue, the app’s total revenue was $159 million and its gross profit was $121 million. In other words, Cash App had a healthy gross profit margin of 76%. Moreover, the app’s revenue jumped 115% YoY, leaving it well-positioned to be a game-changer for SQ.</p>
      <p>If Cash App’s revenue continues to increase at a 100% clip, it  will generate revenue of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2020. If its gross margin stays at similar levels, its annualized gross profit in 2020 is likely to be $800 million to $900 million.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that in Q2, Cash App was <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/top-finance-apps-united-states-q2-2019">downloaded more than any other finance app in the United States</a>.  If that trend continues , its 100% year-over-year top-line growth will also be sustainable.</p>
      <h3>Steady Fundamental Improvement</h3>
      <p>For the first nine months of 2019, Square reported YoY revenue growth of 43.7%. For the same period,its EBITDA, excluding certain items,  jumped 70.3%. If Sqaure’s  EBITDA growth stays over 50% and its cash flows stay robust, the high forward price-earnings ratio of SQ stock will be justified.</p>
      <p>As of September 2019, Square reported cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion. With robust cash reserves and growing cash flows, SQ is well-positioned for innovation-driven expansion.</p>
      <h3>International Expansion Will Boost Square’s Growth</h3>
      <p>In 2019, SQ has reported revenue of $166.6 million from international markets. SQ’s overseas revenue is on track to jump 51.5% in 2019.</p>
      <p>Besides its core market of the United States, SQ has operations in Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom. With the peer-to-peer payments market gaining traction globally, SQ has significant growth opportunities overseas in the coming years.</p>
      <p>Square’s  acquisition of Weebly in 2018 should help SQ expand overseas. Approximately 40% of Weebly’s users are overseas. Since SQ processes <a href="https://www.weebly.com/blog/online-payment-gateways/">payments for Weebly’s</a> websites, the company’s global exposure has increased.</p>
      <p>In Q3, SQ also launched its Square Terminal in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. As a result, it would not be surprising if its revenue from international markets continues to increase 40%-50% YoY. Over the long-term, the impact of its overseas businesses on its overall top line will be meaningful.</p>
      <h3> Final Words on SQ Stock</h3>
      <p>SQ has also applied for a banking license.</p>
      <p>If SQ obtains such a license in the next 12-24 months,  SQ stock would have yet another positive catalyst.</p>
      <p>There are several reasons to be bullish on SQ stock. Consequently,  the current period of consolidation by Square stock is a good buying opportunity.</p>
