      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - The Supreme Court says it will referee a high-profile copyright dispute between technology giants Oracle and Google. Oracle says it wants nearly $9 billion from Google.</p>
      <p>The case stems from Google's development of its hugely popular Android operating system by using Oracle's Java programming language.</p>
      <p>A federal appeals court has twice found that Google unfairly used Java without paying for it. A trial court has yet to assess damages.</p>
      <p>The justices agreed Friday to review the appellate ruling.</p>
      <p>The dispute stretches back to 2010 when Oracle filed suit. The first Android phone went on sale in 2008.</p>
      <p>The high court will hear arguments early next year.</p>
