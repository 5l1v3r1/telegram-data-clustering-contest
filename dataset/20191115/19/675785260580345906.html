      <h1>Man Utd consider Erling Haaland loan back to RB Salzburg if January transfer completed</h1>
      <h2>The teenage scoring sensation has attracted interest from a number of top European clubs but United have sent their top scout to keep tabs on him as they weigh up an offer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:41:48+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:41</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Man Utd</a> are open to loaning Erling Haaland back to Red Bull Salzburg providing they can get a deal done for the striker in January.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are hot on the heels of the 19-year-old after his impressive start to the season which has seen him net 26 goals in 18 appearances.</p>
      <p>Haaland has made no secret of his desire to play in the Premier League, and is attracting interest from elsewhere, including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , Bayern Munich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> .</p>
      <p>United boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has sent his most trusted scout, Steve Wells, to report back on the youngster, as they consider a move to sign him.</p>
      <p>Any transfer was likely to go ahead next summer once the current season has ended, however United are hoping to steal a march on their rivals by finalising a deal in the next transfer window.</p>

      <p>They are considering allowing Haaland to then return to Salzburg until the end of the season, before making his move to Old Trafford permanent.</p>
      <p>Haaland's form has attracted a number of clubs keen on acquiring his services, after hitting five hat-tricks already this campaign.</p>
      <p>He struck nine goals in one match at the summers under-20 World Cup, and has also been on the scoresheet at Anfield this season.</p>
      <p>The son of former Man City and Leeds midfielder Alfe-Inge Haaland, he is represented by super agent Mino Raiola, who knows the United hierarchy well from his dealings with Paul Pogba.</p>

      <p>However despite interest from Europe's elite, Haaland has been warned off of making a move this soon, by Alf Ingve Berntsen, who worked with him in the early stages of his career at Bryne FK.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the interest from other clubs, Berntsen told <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-is-far-from-lewandowskis-level-strikers-former-coach/1ntiu53zvbqhy1a5bfb8zte4ly">Goal</a> and <a href="https://www.spox.com/de/sport/fussball/bundesliga/1911/Artikel/haaland-jugendtrainer-exklusiv-wechsel-zum-fc-bayern-die-anforderungen-waeren-zu-hoch.html">SPOX</a> : "The tactical requirements at Bayern and Liverpool would be a bit too high for now.</p>
      <p>"After all, he has only played in Norway and Austria so far. And also there for a short time.</p>
      <p>“Joining Bayern would be difficult for him at the moment. Because, of course, he still some way to go before he reaches the level of Robert Lewandowski.</p>
      <p>“Erling is a dominant character, sitting on the bench would not be easy for him."</p>
      <p>He added: "What many forget: Haaland was not even a regular player at Salzburg recently," he added. "He did not play regularly until August this year.</p>
      <p>"Of course he caused hype with his goals, but it would probably be advisable to stay at Salzburg for another year.</p>
      <p>“The most important thing for Erling is to play regularly at the highest possible level. It would be bad for him not to play at his new club.</p>
      <p>"He needs playing time at the highest level in order to evolve. To be a substitute at a top club would be a hindrance to this development.”</p>
