      <p>Lydia Hart (Karen Blick) is in for a huge shock as Mandy Dingle (Lisa Riley) has discovered that her supposedly dead mum Agatha is actually alive and well in Emmerdale. After persuading Lydia to reach out to her sister Beth, Mandy regretted her actions as Lydia just felt worse after Beth treated her with disdain.</p>
      <p>As Beth was cold with Lydia and made it clear she had no interest in building a relationship, Mandy was fuming and stormed over to the house to confront her. But when Beth was alerted to the noise Mandy made, Mandy hid and heard Beth explain to her mum that it must have just been kids.</p>
      <p>Hearing Beth address her mum made Mandy realise what is truly going on – and she will waste no time in telling Lydia that her mum is alive. As Lydia reels from this, she braces herself to meet her mum but there are more shocks on the way.</p>

      <p>Agatha pays a visit to Lydia and, as they come face to face, Lydia wants answers on why she was given up as a child. But as they talk, Agatha informs her that she is at high risk of Huntington’s Disease as it is a genetic condition in the family.</p>
      <p>Lydia is worried and confides to her loved ones that she could be ill and Sam (James Hooton) urges her to go in and get tested. But what will Lydia do? When she had cancer fears, she had felt too anxious to face it for some time – can she cope with this hanging over her or will she bury her head in the sand?</p>
      <p>And what about Agatha and Beth? Does Lydia have any hope of becoming part of their family and building any kind of a relationship with them?</p>
