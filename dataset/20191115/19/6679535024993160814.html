      <p>Two women were booked by Saidabad police on sedition charges for their ‘disparaging’ remarks against the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya issue.</p>
      <p>They were also accused of delivering hate speeches and promoting enmity on grounds of religion in a gathering at Ujaleshah Eidgah Ground in Saidabad on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Jille Huma alias Huma Islahi and Shagufta, both residents of Saidabad, led a prayer congregation with over 110 Muslim women without any permission from police, said Saidabad inspector K. Srinivas.</p>
      <p>Sub-inspector Din Dayal Singh, who lodged a complaint against the accused, said that the two raised provocative slogans and criticised the SC judgment, after their prayers.</p>
      <p>Ms. Huma and Ms. Shagufta also displayed a hoarding with pictures of the Supreme Court and Babri Masjid, which stated that they were against the court’s decision. Notices were also served to the two accused, police said.</p>
