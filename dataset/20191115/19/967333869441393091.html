      <p>Donald Trump's former adviser Roger Stone was found guilty on all seven counts, including giving false testimonies to Congress on five occasions, obstructing justice, and witness tampering, by a US federal jury on 15 November.</p>
      <p>His sentence is yet to be determined, but he could face up to 20 years in prison. Stone will remain free until his sentence is determined in February 2020, despite the prosecutors demanding that he be jailed right away.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump, whose election campaign Stone advised in 2016, lashed out at the verdict and called out the lack of investigation into alleged misconduct by a number of his political rivals.</p>

      <h3>Accusations Against Stone</h3>
      <p>67-year-old Stone, who is a veteran political consultant and has worked with Republican politicians such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, as well as advised Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016, was previously accused of lying to the House Intelligence Committee about his connections to the WikiLeaks website. </p>
      <p>The accusations against him <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911061077233230-us-media-playing-defense-with-baseless-linking-of-roger-stone-russia-to-dnc-hack-/">arose as part of the investigation into the now debunked allegations about the Trump campaign</a> conspiring with Russia in order to win the 2016 election. The political consultant has denied any wrongdoing, slamming the case against him as politically motivated.</p>
      <p>According to the testimony of another member of Trump's campaign, Steve Bannon, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911091077263789-trump-campaign-saw-roger-stone-as-access-point-to-wikileaks-bannon-says-/">Stone had boasted about having access to WikiLeaks</a> and gave the team a heads up on imminent publications of damning emails involving Trump's opponent in 2016, Hillary Clinton. This, as well as the consultant's texts and emails of a similar nature, substantiated the accusations against him of having lied to Congress about not having such ties to the whistleblowing website.</p>
