      <p>This group of Fintechs will compete for a £1.5 million challenge prize fund encourages using new open banking technology. Like many other aspects of Fintech, the UK has led the world in the introduction of Open Banking and utilization of the new requirements.</p>

      <p>Nesta states that many people are struggling to stay on top of their finances. One in three (29%) regularly run out of money each month which means around 15.2 million people.</p>
      <p>Through the Open Up Challenge, these 15 companies hope to support 13.5 million people across the UK in all areas of personal finance.</p>
      <p>Over the next eight months, the finalists will work with Nesta Challenges and OBL to further develop their solutions, also receiving non-financial support including marketing, business mentoring and service design.

      <blockquote>“The financial services sector has been slow to respond to society’s evolving needs, whether it’s better serving the UK’s renters, fraud prevention for the vulnerable, or helping those with an unpredictable income manage their finances and get a mortgage. The Open Up 2020 finalists are addressing these issues – and more – using open banking to make it easy for people to overcome some of the real-life issues they are dealing with every day.</blockquote>
      <p>Gorst said that these solutions have the potential to change things for the better and a big shift towards consumer-friendly financial services.</p>
