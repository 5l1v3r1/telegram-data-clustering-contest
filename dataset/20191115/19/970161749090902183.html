      <p>A 29 year-old pervert pretended to be disabled then ‘became visibly aroused’ when a carer changed his diaper, police say.</p>
      <p>Rutledge Deas IV, known as Rory, posted an add on job app UrbanSitter claiming he needed a carer to look after his disabled 18 year-old brother, it is alleged.</p>
      <p>A 20 year-old college student agreed to the tasks, with Deas, from New Orleans, telling her Cory needed handled with ‘tough toddler gloves.’</p>
      <p>He also told the woman that Cory needed potty trained, and help with a car booster seat.</p>
      <p>But police told <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/article_4c694afc-0706-11ea-ac3d-9f512dd50e77.html">Nola.com</a> that ‘Cory’ was actually Rory, with the unsuspecting babysitter caring for him 10 times.</p>

      <p>Deas, who claims to be a web developer with a $2,500-a-month trust fund, reportedly became erect and suck on a pacifier while having his soiled diaper changed.</p>

      <p>The carer grew suspicious about Deas’ alleged seedy behavior.</p>
      <p>She became further alarmed when the man who hired her refused to meet, and instead paid her through Apple Pay or cash sharing app Venmo.</p>
      <p>The woman looked up Deas’ publicly-visible payment history on Venmo, and saw a profile with the name Rory Deas featuring a photo of the man she knew as Cory.</p>
      <p>She reported the alleged deception to UrbanSitter, who closed Deas’s account down. The woman also called police, who discovered the phone number linked to the account was used by Deas, and that he had disguised it.</p>
      <p>After being arrested, Deas denied deriving sexual pleasure from the encounters.</p>
      <p>He claimed to have suffered childhood trauma, and said being treated as a baby brought him ‘back to a time and place when he was at peace.’</p>
      <p>Deas is believed to have hired at least three other carers, with Louisiana State Police expecting to discover other potential victims.</p>
      <p>Orleans Parish District Attorney Michael Henn condemned Deas’ alleged crimes, saying: ‘This guy preys on people who have the compassion and patience to care for disabled individuals.</p>
      <p>‘This is harrowing. I’ve never read anything like this before.’</p>
      <p>Deas has been charged with 10 counts of human trafficking and sexual battery.</p>
      <p>He faces over 100 years in prison if convicted of all counts.</p>
      <p>The suspect also faces drugs charges after cops found crystal meth and a glass pipe.</p>
      <p>Deas is being held in jail in lieu of $1.5million bond.</p>
