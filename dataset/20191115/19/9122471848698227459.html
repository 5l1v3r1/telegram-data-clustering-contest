      <h1>Minnesota Vikings Announce Adam Thielen’s Status For Sunday’s Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:02:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>The Minnesota Vikings host the Denver Broncos this weekend. The team is in the middle of a playoff race, and will once again be without star wide receiver Adam Thielen on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Vikings sit at 7-3 and have looked very strong, winning five of their last six games. The sole loss came to the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
      <p>With the first place Green Bay Packers on bye, Minnesota can get within a half-game of Aaron Rodgers and company with a win. The Denver Broncos are one of the worst teams in the AFC, so this is a prime opportunity for Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Thielen is a big absence, though. He’s been dealing with a <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/adam-thielen-injury-vikings-cowboys">nagging hamstring injury</a> for a few weeks now. He did play in the Chiefs game, but left early after aggravating it.</p>
      <p>Thielen initially missed the Week 8 game against Washington, as well as last weekend’s win over the Dallas Cowboys. He hasn’t recorded a catch since Week 7, when he had one reception for a 25 yard touchdown against the Detroit Lions.</p>
      <p>Now, according to Adam Schefter, Adam Thielen is out yet again tomorrow.</p>

      <p>On the season, Thielen has 27 catches for 391 yards and six touchdowns. His absence places more pressure on Stefon Diggs, who has been up-and-down in his absence.</p>
      <p>In Weeks 7 and 8, Diggs had back-to-back seven-catch, 143 yard games, but has been held to four catches for 53 yards in the last two weeks. He hasn’t scored since his three-touchdown outburst against the Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 13.</p>
      <p>The Vikings and Broncos kick off at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday.</p>
