      <h1>Weary passengers on how they coped with record-breaking 19 hour London to Sydney flight</h1>
      <h2>Passengers whiled away the hours on the Qantus flight by drinking wine for breakfast, watching two sunrises, and stretched together in the gangway</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:21:50+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author">Brendan McFadden</a></address>
      <p>Passengers on board the world's longest ever continuous flight have revealed how they spent their time during their epic journey.</p>
      <p>The Qantus jet left London around 6am local time on Thursday and touched down in Sydney at 12.28pm today.</p>
      <p>The 250 capacity Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was carrying just 50 people on its 11,060-mile journey - many of them Qantas staffers and journalists.</p>
      <p>They have now told how they whiled away the hours by drinking wine for breakfast, watching two sunrises, and stretching together in the gangway.</p>
      <p>They have spoke of how physiologists led aerobic exercises for the passengers including squats and walks around the cabin, MailOnline reported.</p>

      <p>One passenger, Jill Gralow of Reuters, said passengers were offered steak sandwiches, soup and wine instead of regular breakfast fare. </p>
      <p>Passengers enjoyed their first sunrise shortly after take-off from London.</p>
      <p>To simulate the night in Sydney the lights were switched off a few hours after takeoff despite it still being daytime in Europe.    </p>
      <p>This was done in the hope of tricking passengers' body clocks into making the 11-hour leap.</p>

      <p>Passengers witnessed their second sunrise as they flew over Indonesia and were served a spicy breakfast to help their body clock adjust.</p>
      <p>Footage showed passengers walked between the aisles and stretching to touch the ceiling during the aerobic workout.</p>

      <p>One of the guests Andy Chevis said: "I actually feel fantastic, I feel really well. Probably a lot better than I normally would at this point in the flight, to be honest."</p>
      <p>University of Sydney physiologist Corinne Caillaud said: "Meal composition and schedules, well-timed exercise and lighting can all 'help people adjust better and reduce jetlag."</p>

      <p>The flight was part of a project to research the effects on crew and passengers of ultra long haul services which Quantus is considering.</p>
      <p>Qantus' project is called "Project Sunrise" after the airline's double-sunrise endurance flights during World War Two.</p>
      <p>The flight kicked off a year of celebrations for the centenary of the Australian flag carrier, which will officially turn 99 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Captain Helen Trenerry, who led the test flight, said before takeoff on Wednesday that research data including activity monitoring, sleep diaries, cognitive testing and monitoring of melatonin levels would help determine whether the crew mix of one captain, one first officer and two second officers was appropriate or if more experience was needed.</p>
      <p>"They will be very, very long flights and fatiguing over the long term," she said, adding she would like to see regulations in place to limit the trips to around one a month for pilots.</p>
      <p>After the flight on Friday she told reporters she would "absolutely" do the flight again but "I don't know about often".</p>
