      <p>Temperatures into the mid 30s, very low humidity and gusty winds once again threaten the state this weekend, after a week of firefighting that saw “catastrophic” conditions and four lives lost.</p>
      <p>NSW remains in a state of emergency, with severe fire danger ratings issued for New England, the Northern Slopes and northwestern regions on Saturday. Total fire bans are in effect in those areas, as well as the far north coast, which has been issued a very high fire danger.</p>
      <p>Four people have died so far and the RFS said more than 250 homes have been destroyed, almost 90 homes have been damaged, and some 480 outbuildings and 18 facilities have also been razed. In some positive news the RFS believes their efforts have saved more than 2000 buildings.</p>
      <p>In Queensland, QFES said most of the state will experience high and very high conditions this weekend, with the Granite Belt and Darling Downs expected to reach severe conditions today and extreme tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Lightning is believed to have caused at least five bushfires burning in Queensland, the <i>Courier-Mail </i>reports.</p>
      <p>The publication claims fires in the D’aigular Range, Wamuran, Pumicestone, Bribie Island and Moreton Island were all caused by lightning strikes that occurred during severe storms on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>One of those blazes forced the evacuation of Cowan Cowan on Moreton Island.</p>
      <p>At the moment, there are more than 80 fires burning across the state.</p>

      <p>Queensland Fire and Emergency Services has warned the fire in Tregony "could get worse" and that residents should be on alert.</p>
      <p>Fireys have warned locals should be ready to leave the area as the situation could worsen "quickly".</p>
      <p>At the moment, a large fire is travelling in a westerly direction towards areas east of Spicers Gap Road along the Cunningham Highway. </p>
      <p>Residents who have already evacuated can now return to their homes, but are advised to be prepared to leave again as the situation could change quickly. </p>
      <p>Fire crews are working to contain the fire and will continue to monitor overnight but firefighters may not be able to protect every property.</p>
      <p>Residents have been warned they "should not expect a firefighter" at their door, and that people in the area will be affected by smoke, which will reduce visibility and air quality.</p>

      <p>A man has been seriously injured after he fell three metres from a ladder at a property in the area of a massive bushfire on the NSW mid-north coast.</p>
