      <h1>SpongeBob’s Squidward is getting his own spinoff on Netflix</h1>
      <h2>The Squidward spinoff is heading to Netflix</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:53:21+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>A new Squidward-starring project is coming to Netflix.</p>
      <p>That’s right, SpongeBob SquarePants’ cranky next-door neighbour is getting his own music-based spinoff. It’s unclear if the no-pants-wearing squid will be featured in a movie or TV show, however.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/13/netflix-nickelodeon-partnership/">Netflix and Nickelodeon</a> recently announced a new deal where the two companies plan to work together to produce content that will stream on Netflix. The content is an extension of Nickelodeon’s pre-existing intellectual properties, like <i>SpongeBob SquarePants.</i></p>
      <p>Rodger Bumpass voices the grumpy clarinet player, but it’s unclear if he’ll make return for this new spinoff.</p>
      <p>It’s also unclear when the Squidward project will hit Netflix. Personally, I’d would prefer a spinoff based on Sandra ‘Sandy’ Cheeks.</p>
      <p><i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> premiered in 1999 and is somehow still ongoing. The sponge and his friends have already been in two movies — one I actually went to the theatres to see when I was 11 — with another coming out in 2020.</p>
