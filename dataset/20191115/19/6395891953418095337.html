      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - The Supreme Court will decide whether to reinstate convictions for rape by a military officer and two enlisted men.</p>
      <p>The issue is whether they could be prosecuted long after the rapes occurred.</p>
      <p>A military appeals court threw out the convictions because too much time had elapsed between the assaults and the prosecutions, but the justices agreed Friday to reconsider those rulings.</p>
      <p>The cases involve women who for differing reasons initially decided not to press charges but later changed their minds.</p>
      <p>The crimes all were committed before 2006. The Uniform Code of Military Justice has been changed so that there is no statute of limitations on rape charges.</p>
