      <p>‘Jasmine’, a new Nollywood romantic comedy starring comedian Okon Lagos has debuted in cinemas nationwide.</p>
      <p>The movie also features A-list actors like Nancy Isime, Deyemi Okanlawon, Stan Nze, Bernadette Obi, Becky Odungide, Uduak Akpabio and Fon Peter.</p>
      <p>Produced by Voguefilms Productions and directed by Moses Eskor, ‘Jasmine’ offers an incisive look at squabbles among young couples, and its hilarious twists, offering viewers a pulsating experience.</p>
      <p>The producers say ”the movie will also open viewers’ eyes to those things that ordinarily are over-looked in social interactions but are of the essence to a mutually beneficial relationship”.</p>
      <p>The film was shot at various scenic locations in and around Akwa-Ibom State.</p>
      <p>Speaking with PREMIUM TIMES in Lagos on Friday, the executive producer of the film, Yuudee Nyot, said the film touches on everyday life issues that are often overlooked.</p>
      <p>“I particularly love how Okon Lagos, Deyemi Okanlawon, Stan Nze, and Nancy Isime take a rom-com set-up and steadily buildup the storyline. The twists in the plot of the movie would make viewers stay glued to the screen.</p>
      <p>”I love to describe the film as the story of a couple caught in the web of their differences. He is the ‘Dream Husband’; she is the ‘Spoilt Wife’. Their marriage is ‘PERFECT’. All of a sudden, she wants more; he wants more. Can this marriage be saved? The viewers will have to find out what happens next when they see the film,” Ms Ndot noted.</p>

      <p>On the choice of location, the producers said they are simply trying to showcase Akwa Ibom State to the world whilst also improving the state’s promising entertainment industry</p>
      <p>“Akwa Ibom is beautiful and serene with good roads, less traffic which makes moving from a location to another easier. I knew we would shoot as late as 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., so I chose to shoot the film at a location where the safety of my cast and crew members could be guaranteed,” she said.</p>
      <p>In his remarks, the director said the twists in the plot of the movie would make viewers stay glued to the screen.</p>
      <p>The film will be screened at major cinema houses across the country throughout the month.</p>
