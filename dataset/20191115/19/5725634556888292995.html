      <p><b>Heron Therapeutics (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HRTX">HRTX</a>)</b> posted Q3 results this week. Both top and bottom line numbers beat the consensus. The shares also saw a rash of Buy reiterations at analyst firms following this third quarter earnings report. The stock has not seen much of a rally given these events. In today's post, we examine results and look at what is ahead for Heron Therapeutics.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Company Overview</b>
      </p>
      <p>Heron Therapeutics develops compounds utilizing its proprietary Biochronomer drug delivery technology, which delivers therapeutic levels on a range of short-acting pharmacological agents over a period from days to weeks with a single administration. Heron currently has two products on the market and a potentially more important one (HTX-011) in late-stage development whose NDA was recently <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3510063-fda-accepts-herons-refiled-htxminus-011-application-shares-6-percent-premarket">accepted</a> by the FDA for review. The company's current market cap is approximately $1.8 billion and trades for just over $20 a share.</p>
      <p>

          <b>Q3 Highlights:</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>The company posted a loss of 42 cents a share in the quarter, 15 cents a share above the consensus. Revenues rose some 115% on a year-over-year basis to just over $42 million, $8 million above expectations.</p>
      <p>Sales growth continues to be driven CINVANTI which posted sales of $36.4 million for the quarter. This is a huge increase from the $16.4 million CINVANTI did in the same period a year ago. This product is used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. SUSTOL sales rose to $6.2 million from $3.4 million in the year ago period. Nine-month sales of $13.3 million are lower than $15.8 million in the first nine months of 2018.</p>
      <p>Management raised their full-year revenue guidance for FY2019 to $135 million from its previous range of $115 million to $120 million, a significant bump up in the forecast.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Analyst Commentary and Balance Sheet</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wednesday, Northland Securities <a href="https://www.analystratings.com/articles/heron-therapeutics-hrtx-gets-a-buy-rating-from-northland-securities/"><b>reiterated</b></a> its Buy rating and $47 price target on Heron. Tuesday, Stifel Nicolaus ($36), Cowen &amp; Co. ($40 price target) and Needham ($50 price target) all reissued Buy ratings as well. The company now has over $400 million in cash on the balance sheet. Net cash used for operating activities by Heron for the first three quarters of 2019 was $97.6 million.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Verdict</b>
      </p>
      <p>Heron is executing well with its current, two approved products, especially CINVANTI. The company should get a big lift as well when HTX-011 is approved in late March. This product is the first and only extended-release local anesthetic to demonstrate in Phase 3 studies significantly reduced pain and opioid use through 72 hours compared to bupivacaine solution, the current standard-of-care local anesthetic for postoperative pain control. Given the huge focus in the nation on less addictive pain management products, HTX-011 should garner significant market share.</p>

      </p>
      <p>HTX-011 has both Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA, which is currently evaluating its NDA under accelerated review. A decision is scheduled for March 26th of next year. In addition, CINVANTI should get an additional sales boost in the fourth quarter. In late October, the FDA <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3507730-fda-oks-expanded-label-herons-cinvanti-shares-ahead-4-percent-premarket">approved</a> the company's supplemental New Drug Application or sNDA for CINVANTI for intravenous (IV) use.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In summary, the company is already seeing impressive growth from its CINVANTI franchise and has a potentially even bigger product on the horizon in HTX-011. Strong analyst support is also present even as the shares have not yet gotten the boost from Q3 results they deserve.</p>
