      <p>The District panchayat has demanded stringent measures to curb the sale of intoxicants to students.</p>
      <p>In a meeting held at the District Panchayat hall, the members demanded that a case be booked under Sections 77 and 78 of the Juvenile Justice Act for imprisonment for up to seven years if one is found guilty of selling or using intoxicating substances.</p>
      <p>District Panchayat President K.V. Sumesh said that a meeting would be convened with the District Police Chief and the public prosecutor to discuss the issue. Stringent action was necessary at a time when suicides and mental stress were on the rise among children, he said.</p>
