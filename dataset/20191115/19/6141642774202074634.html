      <p>A ketogenic diet may help in the fight against flu, new research suggests.</p>
      <p>Scientists found that mice fed the high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, were better able to combat the virus than those fed food high in carbohydrates.</p>
      <p>The Yale University study suggests the ketogenic diet, which includes meat, fish, poultry, and non-starchy vegetables for people, activates a subset of T cells in the lungs not previously associated with the immune system’s response to influenza.</p>
      <p>Researchers found that the cells enhanced mucus production from airway cells that can effectively trap the virus.</p>
      <p>Co-senior author Akiko Iwasaki, the Waldemar Von Zedtwitz professor of immunobiology and molecular, cellular and developmental biology, said: “This was a totally unexpected finding.”</p>
      <blockquote>This study shows that the way the body burns fat to produce ketone bodies from the food we eat can fuel the immune system to fight flu infection<cite>Professor Visha Deep Dixit</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Mice that had been fed a ketogenic diet for seven days before infection were protected from body weight loss and had improved survival relative to mice on a normal chow diet.</p>
      <p>In addition, they were able to better maintain blood oxygen saturation, suggesting improved gas exchange as compared with chow-fed mice, according to the paper published in Science Immunology.</p>
      <p>The animals were randomised to indicated diet groups for one week before infection, and were subsequently monitored for clinical signs of disease and euthanised to assess the immune response.</p>
      <p>Co-senior author Visha Deep Dixit, the Waldemar Von Zedtwitz professor of comparative medicine and of immunobiology, said: “This study shows that the way the body burns fat to produce ketone bodies from the food we eat can fuel the immune system to fight flu infection.”</p>
      <p>Dr Jenna Macciochi, lecturer in immunology, University of Sussex, said: “Although the authors have made obvious efforts to delineate the mechanistic link, there are some important considerations, namely that mice and humans are different metabolically.</p>
      <p>“In addition, humans and mice do not have equivalent populations of gamma deltas T cells which limits the translatability of the findings to humans.</p>
      <p>“Though this study further adds to the growing scientific literature that dietary manipulation of the three macronutrients – protein/carbs/fats – represents a novel avenue to treat inflammatory conditions, it’s too early to speculate on what this may look like for humans.</p>
      <p>“Since 2016 it has been known that there may be a thread of scientific truth to the old adage ‘feed a cold, starve a fever’, and this study adds support to this, opening up the possibility of ketogenic diets for treatment not only of flu but other conditions where inflammation can cause us collateral damage.”</p>
