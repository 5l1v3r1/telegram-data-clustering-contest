      <p>Oh, beloveds, I'm vexed. Last night, Chris Evans—who is not so much a snack as he is an entire buffet, like a buffet in one those restaurants that is 100 percent buffet; there is no menu, just a buffet with its own mailing address and a carving station and a Hibachi grill and fresh biscuits, and froyo—wore a white, double-breasted suit to the West Hollywood premiere of his new film, <i>Knives Out</i>.</p>
      <p>Beloveds, what in the Sam Hill is this cream-colored Kentucky Fried couture? And why do I love it so much?</p>

      <p>Here's the facts: A double-breasted suit is so much suit. How many breasts does this suit have? Double what you'd think. It's the man equivalent of a wrap dress but not as cute. It is nigh on impossible to wear a double-breasted suit without looking like a very wealthy box. Like a box that was given a small million-dollar loan from its father, Mr. Box. Double-breasted suits literally look like the year 1983. Every double-breasted suit has a gigantic pocket for you to store your equally gigantic carphone in.</p>

      <p>As if the surplus of fabric wasn't enough, double-breasted suits also have <i>six </i>buttons! What are these, Harry Styles' pants? Outrageous.</p>

      <p><i>Six buttons</i>. Is is this clothing or a Blackberry? Do you know how I want Chris Evans to be? Not buttoned up, I'll tell you that much. Not locked in a prison made of six buttons, okay? Very unbuttoned, if you catch my drift. I think we're seeing button-to-button here. Less buttons on Chris Evans and less suit in general. That's all I can say during work hours. Let's chat later.</p>
      <p>So much suit on this man! Look at those lapels! Great for grabbing, I suppose, but also they are so big that you could make another whole garment out of them. Are they lapels or are they a minidress waiting to happen? That's the question we have to ask ourselves today. Another question: Why are we draping America's ass in so much fabric? Isn't there a law against this?!</p>
      <p>And it's corduroy?! With a crocheted tie? This is <i>so much </i>lewk! I'm overwhelmed. I'm stressed. I'm incredibly attracted. Pray for me.</p>

      <p>My dude really rolled up on the premiere of <i>Knives Out </i>looking like a railroad tycoon who says things like "Apologies for being late; I had helicopter trouble!" and "Mind the emus; they bite!" and "Welcome to Jurassic Park!" Ole boy looks like a secondary character in a Bette Midler/Shelley Long movie about sisters who renovate a Sandals resort. He looks like if you said "Hey Jeeves, show me the complete opposite of a goth." A white, corduroy, double-breasted suit! The sheer gall of this exceptionally attractive man!</p>

      <p>And, not to sound like Kathleen Turner in <i>Serial Mom</i>, but are we just going to let him walk around in public wearing white <i>months </i>after Labor Day? I know that we've basically thrown all societal norms out the window and spend all our time alternately cancelling and impeaching each other, but we have to preserve something! And, apparently, that something is an arbitrary rule about when you can wear a certain color based on a regional holiday.</p>
      <p>I mean, wear whatever you want whenever you want but also: Chris Evans, please see me in my office.</p>
