      <h1>South Carolina AD Issues Statement on Will Muschamp</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:47:45+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>South Carolina’s 2019-20 season will be remembered for one thing: <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/south-carolina-georgia-upset-2019">the Gamecocks’ 20-17 double-overtime upset of Georgia</a>. It still stands as one of the biggest upsets this season. But other than that, there isn’t much to be proud of if you’re a USC fan, and head coach Will Muschamp’s job is definitely not fully secure.</p>
      <p>The Gamecocks are 4-6 with two games left to become bowl eligible. But that seems unlikely as they still have to play Texas A&amp;M and Clemson. Since USC’s win over Georgia, the team is 1-3 with losses to Tennessee, Appalachian State and Florida.</p>
      <p>Will Muschamp has certainly had a rough season as USC’s head coach. There’s been some chatter regarding whether or not he’ll be coaching for South Carolina beyond this season.</p>
      <p>Athletic director Ray Tanner put that chatter to bed in a statement released on Friday. Here’s a bit of what Tanner had to say:</p>
      <blockquote>“Today, I want to make it clear that Will Muschamp is our football coach and will be our coach going forward,” Tanner said. “President Caslen and I are fully supportive of his leadership and his development of student-athletes on and off the field. Coach Muschamp and our staff are dedicated to the success of Gamecock football.”</blockquote>
      <p>You can read the rest of the statement in the tweet below.</p>

      <p>Tanner does go on to say that he wishes some of South Carolina’s games ended in a different outcome. But he is “excited about the future of our program.”</p>
      <p>The AD and former USC baseball coach has <a href="https://www.dailygamecock.com/article/2019/09/column-ray-tanner-change">faced his own pressure</a>, as the football program has struggled to maintain momentum from the Steve Spurrier era under his guidance.</p>
      <p>This backs up <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/south-carolina/will-muschamp-hot-seat-buyout-contract-robert-caslen">statements made by school president Robert Caslen</a>, who directly addressed Muschamp’s large buyout, which definitely makes his firing less likely.</p>
      <p>It looks like Muschamp will be sticking around for the time being. The Gamecocks face Texas A&amp;M on Saturday.</p>
