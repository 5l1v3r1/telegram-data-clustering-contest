      <p>A 17-year-old boy who left a teenager paralysed from the waist down after a shooting has been sentenced to more than eight years' detention in youth custody.</p>
      <p>The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was last month found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to the shooting in Blackwater, Hampshire, on February 10, 2018.</p>
      <p>Opening the case, Andy Houston QC, prosecuting, had told the court tensions had risen between the defendant and Danny Stevens, who was 17 at the time, following a fatal road collision in 2017.</p>
      <p>The defendant was in one of the cars involved in the crash. Stevens, now 19, was a friend of the man who died, the court previously heard.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor told the jury that phone messages suggested the defendant's mother had been assaulted by Stevens the day before the shooting, and "that may be the reason he shot him in revenge".</p>

      <p>He added that local residents heard shouting and shots being fired, with one telling police she saw a young male holding a gun at shoulder height, Get Surrey reports.</p>
      <p>Mr Houston said: "She saw the male pointing it at a car and then at a person and then fired it, saw the puff of smoke and down went the man, who we now know is Danny Stevens, who immediately gave out a shout of 'I am paralysed'; he was right, he was paralysed.</p>
      <p>"The bullet went through his abdomen and into an area of his spine and lodged in his arm."</p>
      <p>Following the two week trial at Winchester Crown Court, the jury decided the defendant was not guilty of attempted murder but came to a majority verdict that he was guilty of causing GBH with intent.</p>
      <p>He had denied both allegations.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Garnham sentenced the defendant to eight years and 10 weeks' youth custody, which was reduced by 40% to take into account his age.</p>
      <p>"You fired twice and the second shot hit Mr Stevens," he said.</p>
      <p>"It has left him severely disabled and in permanent pain. He is paralysed from the waist down. He will never walk again.</p>
      <p>"I accept there was some provocation from the assaults upon your family. Your response to that provocation was grossly disproportionate.</p>
      <p>"It was a reaction out of all proportion to the threat you perceived he posed to you and your family.</p>
      <p>"You shot at him quite deliberately with the intention to cause him really serious injury. In my judgment using a gun and inflicting such profound injury takes this to the very top of the guidelines."</p>
