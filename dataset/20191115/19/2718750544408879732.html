      <h1>Clive Owen Will Be <i>Impeachment: American Crime Story</i>’s Very British Bill Clinton</h1>

      <p>Brace yourselves for an exciting adventure in a Brit doing a folksy southern accent, because Clive Owen is stepping up to the job of playing Bill Clinton in the next season of <i>American Crime Story</i>. (Do Americans get any acting jobs anymore? This is <i>Little Women</i> all over again!) Per <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/impeachment-american-crime-story-clive-owen-bill-clinton-1203406296/"><i>Variety</i></a>, Owen will play the former president in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/american-crime-story-impeachment-lewinsky-bill-clinton.html"><i>Impeachment: American Crime Story</i></a>, which will focus on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, starring Beanie Feldstein as Lewinsky (and with Lewinsky herself onboard as a producer), Sarah Paulson as Linda Tripp, and Annaleigh Ashford as Paula Jones.</p>
      <p>The series is based on Jeffrey Toobin’s book <i>A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President</i>, which is promising given that Toobin also wrote the book that formed the basis for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/the-people-v-oj-simpson/"><i>The People v. O.J. Simpson</i></a>. Production is set to start in early 2020, with an air date on FX on September 27, 2020, just weeks before the presidential election. Sure, that’s dramatic timing, but <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/american-horror-story-season-10-spoilers-ryan-murphy-ahs-1984-interview-season-finale-ratched-hollywood-streaming-dates-1202785704/">Murphy himself has defended it</a>. “I know that a lot of people have big opinions about that, about whether when that will air,” Murphy said, adding, “I think that idea of impeachment obviously with Trump is fascinating. I wouldn’t say that we’re changing things that much or mentioning Trump at all in our narrative.”</p>
