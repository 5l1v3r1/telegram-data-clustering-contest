      <p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday security services will assess the risks posed by suspected ISIS group members deported home to Germany by Turkey.<br/><br/>Merkel said that Germany’s joint counter-terrorism center would apply the same procedures to them as with people already in the country “and then determine in each case whether there are security risks.”<br/><br/>Authorities in Berlin confirmed that a 55-year-old man, one of seven people deported Thursday to Germany by Turkey, has been detained on an existing warrant for fraud.<br/><br/>The other six people — four women, a man and a baby — were able to return to their home in Hildesheim, near Hannover.<br/><br/>Turkey accused them of being supporters of the ISIS group.<br/><br/>Ankara began deportations on Monday.<br/><br/>Turkey has over the past weeks criticized European nations for refusing to take back their nationals. It has vowed to send back ISIS militants — even if their citizenships have been revoked.<br/><br/>Turkey has captured several hundred people affiliated with ISIS over the last month as its forces seized a pocket of territory in northeastern Syria.<br/><br/>Turkey launched an offensive into northeastern Syria against the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) last month following a decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw troops from the region. The move prompted widespread concern over the fate of ISIS prisoners in the region.</p>
