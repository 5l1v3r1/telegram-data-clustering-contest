      <h4>What just happened? Overwatch maker Blizzard recently commissioned Internet mad scientist Colin Furze to create a real-life version of Junkrat’s RIP-tire from Overwatch. Unsurprisingly to anyone, Furze succeeded in grand fashion.</h4>
      <p>The RIP-tire, for those unfamiliar, is essentially a remote-controlled tire bomb unicycle weapon thing… with giant spikes. As you’ll see, Furze modified a chainsaw engine to serve as the drive mechanism for his wacky creation. He managed to squeeze it all inside of a standard-sized tire and even outfitted it with training wheels to help keep it upright.</p>
      <p>Spikes were added for visual effect but they aren’t functional as rolling on such an uneven surface simply wouldn’t work. Even without them, Furze’s RIP-tire is quite capable of causing some serious ruckus. Just watch how it plows through his backyard fence with ease.</p>
      <p>A servo and other wireless bits were added to make the RIP-tire remote-controllable although it just goes straight – there is no real turning involved.</p>
      <p>Furze isn't 100 percent satisfied with his creation - it's just not destructive enough. He promises to address that shortcoming in his next video so stay tuned.</p>
