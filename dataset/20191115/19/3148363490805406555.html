      <h1>Mason Rudolph's Agent Considering Legal Action Against Myles Garrett</h1>
      <h2>The agent for Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph says legal action may be taken against Cleveland Browns lineman Myles Garrett for attacking Rudolph with a helmet during Thursday night’s game.</h2>

      <p>“I am gathering all information and no options have been removed from the table,” sports agent Tim Younger <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28086510/mason-rudolph-agent-no-legal-options-ruled-steelers-browns-fight">told</a> ESPN on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The agent’s warning comes on the heels of Thursday’s fight between Rudolph and Garrett, an altercation which saw Garrett use a helmet like a weapon to club Rudolph over the head.</p>
      <p>Younger took to his Twitter account to define Garrett’s actions as indefensible:</p>

      <p>After the game, Rudolph <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/11/15/watch-mason-rudolph-calls-myles-garrett-a-coward-helmet-attack/">called</a> the attack “cowardly” and “bush league.”</p>
      <p>On Friday morning, Garrett was indefinitely suspended for the fight. The league also fined both teams $250,000 for the incident:</p>

      <p>For his part, Garrett later claimed his actions were “foolish” and “out of character” for him.<br/>“I made a mistake,” he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/browns-myles-garrett-suspended-without-pay-after-striking-steelers-qb-with-helmet.html">told</a> the media. “I lost my cool, and I regret it. It’s going to come back to hurt our team.”</p>
      <p>“He understands what he did,” Browns coach Freddie Kitchens added. “He understands that’s totally unacceptable, and we’ve got to get through it.”</p>
