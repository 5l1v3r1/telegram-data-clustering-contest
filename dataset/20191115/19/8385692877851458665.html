      <p>In Best Buy's latest round of pre-Black Friday <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discounts</a>, it has put the Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM Bluetooth speaker on sale for just $39.99. Saving $60 off of the regular price.</p>
      <p>The Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM Bluetooth speaker is a really great speaker, especially for its price. It's pretty small, but very compact. It offers up some great battery life, impressive sound and it's still waterproof. That makes this great for those that like to take it to the beach or the pool.</p>
      <p>This is rated at IP67, which means that it can be submerged in water as well. And in fact, the Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM is going to float while it's playing music. Now that's pretty cool.</p>

      <p>When it comes to battery life, we're looking at around 10 hours on a single charge. That's not too bad, especially considering the size of this one. That is enough to keep it going all day long and then some. Now unfortunately, since this speaker is a couple of years old now, it does charge via micro USB. Meaning that you likely are going to need to bring a separate cable with you to charge it.</p>
      <p>Then there's the audio quality. Ultimate Ears has been really good with audio quality over the years. Offering some really loud sounding speakers, that do not distort the sound, but still offer some really great sounding speakers too. Part of this is because its speakers are all 360-degrees, making it easier to fill an entire room with audio. The bass is pretty deep, with mids and highs being pretty clear.</p>
      <p>Ultimate Ears also includes a loop on the WONDERBOOM which you can use to easily attach it to something like a backpack.</p>
