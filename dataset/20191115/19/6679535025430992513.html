      <p>The police arrested him amid slogans by his supporters and TDP workers when he visited his home to see his ailing wife.</p>
      <p>His name hit the headlines when he allegedly assaulted a woman Tahsildar D. Vanajakshi of Musunuru block for allegedly obstructing illegal sand mining in West Godavari district.</p>
      <p>A history sheet was opened against him in 1996 and he faces a total of 67 cases.</p>
