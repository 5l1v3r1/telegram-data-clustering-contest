      <h1>Notre Dame vs. Navy: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:01:34+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>One of the most storied rivalries in college football will have its 93rd meeting this weekend when Notre Dame hosts Navy in a battle of ranked opponents.</p>
      <p>Notre Dame has already lost two games this season, but is coming off of back-to-back wins against ACC programs. Last weekend, the Fighting Irish dismantled the Duke Blue Devils on the road.</p>
      <p>Navy is riding an impressive five-game winning streak that includes victories over Air Force and Tulane. The offense is averaging 357.9 rushing yards per game.</p>
      <p>Ian Book has to be the marquee player to watch in this matchup, but dual-threat quarterback Malcolm Perry is also dynamic in his own right. He currently has 722 passing yards, 1,042 rushing yards and 21 total touchdowns on the year.</p>
      <p>The Midshipmen are underdogs heading into this game, but they should keep things close against the Fighting Irish.</p>

      <p>For the first time in 46 years, the Fighting Irish won’t have the luxury of playing in front of a sold-out crowd. The team’s <a href="https://thespun.com/independents/notre-dame-fighting-irish/notre-dame-football-sellout-streak-ending">sellout streak</a> came to an end this week.</p>
      <p>Will Notre Dame win its third-straight showdown against Navy, or will an upset occur in South Bend?</p>
