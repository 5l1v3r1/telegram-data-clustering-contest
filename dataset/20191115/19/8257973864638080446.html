      <p>Kiara Thomas <a href="http://www.molottery.com/media/news_release.jsp?articleId=14298">told Missouri Lottery officials</a> she was visiting her family in St. Louis in June when her mother talked her into buying a Lucky for Life drawing ticket at the QuikTrip store in St. Louis.</p>

      <p>The winning numbers were 4-5-8-10-46, and the Lucky Ball, which Thomas did not match, was 5.</p>
