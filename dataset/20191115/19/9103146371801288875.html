We scored a goal which was rejected by the referee (Joseph Ochom) and his assistant. It seems referees come with an agenda to see URA lose a match or draw. But we shall continue playing since we cannot withdraw from the league," stated Ssimbwa.<br/><br/>The result saw URA go two consecutive games without a win while their opponents Busoga United extended there winning less run to five games.<br/><br/>In an early kickoff, a Ben Ocen penalty saw Police beat Bright Stars 1-0. This was the first game for Bright Coach Paul Kiwanuka who returned to the team after former coach Muhammed Kisekka was deployed by the club in another capacity as the head of Scouting and Youth Development.<br/><br/>Kiwanuka who also guided the club to the topflight league will be in charge until the end of the season and will be deputised by Simon Mugerwa who was an assistant to Kisekka.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Souleymane Bamba and Ibrahim Orit each had a goal as Mbarara City defeated Kyetume 2-0 at Kakyeka Stadium.<br/><br/>This was Mbarara City second consecutive victory since they appointed Brian Ssenyondo  to replace Paul Nkata who had gone several games without winning.<br/><br/> </p>
