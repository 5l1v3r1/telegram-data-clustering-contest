      <p>The statement said that the cause of incident could not be ascertained.</p>
      <p>The statement reads: “@NigAirForce Helicopter has crashed on landing in Enugu after a routine flight today. Fortunately, there were no fatalities or injuries to any crew member or persons on the ground.</p>
      <p>“@CAS_AMSadique has directed that a Board of Inquiry be constituted to determine the causes of the accident.</p>
      <p>“Nigeria Air Force continues to solicit the understanding and support of the general public as it daily strives to ensure the security of Nigeria and Nigerians.”</p>
