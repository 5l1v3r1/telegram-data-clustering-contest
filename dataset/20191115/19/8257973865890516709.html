      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- South Korean boy band CIX has released a full video for "Hello, Strange Place."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/K-pop/?tps=1">K-pop</a> group released an edited <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MLvPdJ52kQ">story film</a> for the project Friday after sharing the individual clips this week.</p>
      <p>"Hello, Strange Place" features five "episodes": "Butterfly Effect," "Bystander," "Self Slaughter," "Abrupt Absence" and "Broken Family." CIX explores bullying, violence, isolation and death in the film.</p>
      <p>Fans have had mixed reactions to the episodes, with some praising CIX for tackling uncomfortable societal issues.</p>
      <p>"cix's story films are very graphic and dark and i truly applaud them for talking about things like these but i must say, i really wasn't expecting this," one person <a href="https://twitter.com/hwanscheeks/status/1194662299006468096">tweeted</a> after the release of "Abrupt Absence" this week.</p>
      <p>"Hello, Strange Place" precedes the release of CIX's EP <i>Hello Chapter 2: Hello, Strange Place</i>, out Tuesday. The mini album is a followup to <i>Hello Chapter 1: Hello, Stranger</i>, released in July.</p>
      <p>CIX debuted as a group in July. The group is known for the singles "Movie Star" and "Numb."</p>
