        <b>An inquest has opened into the death of a 31-year-old woman from Bury St Edmunds who died after a night out drinking with friends.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zeta Maria Doherty died at her home in Prospect Row on Friday, August 23.</p>
      <p>Coroners' officer Julie Leacock told the inquest Miss Doherty had gone out with three friends on August 22 to a fourth friend's house in the town, spending the evening drinking spirits.</p>
      <p>She said at 10.30pm the four left the friend's house and returned to Prospect Row.</p>
      <p>At one point, a friend noticed Miss Doherty was "wobbly on her feet" and unable to stand.</p>
      <p>When asked if she had taken anything, she said she had taken "a load of" an epilepsy and anxiety medication. Her friends woke at 9am and found Miss Doherty unresponsive.</p>
      <p>An ambulance was called and her friends started CPR but she could not be revived.</p>
      <p>The inquest resumes on January 10 next year.</p>
