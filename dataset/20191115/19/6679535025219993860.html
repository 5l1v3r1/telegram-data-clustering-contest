      <h1>International friendly: Lionel Messi scores on Argentina return to sink Brazil</h1>
      <h2>Brazil were unable to find an equaliser as their winless run since capturing the Copa America title extended to five matches.</h2>

      <p>Lionel Messi struck on his return to international duty Friday following a three-month ban as Argentina defeated fierce rivals Brazil 1-0 in a friendly in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>The Barcelona forward was suspended by CONMEBOL for accusing South American football's ruling body of “corruption” after he was sent off in July's third-place play-off with Chile at the Copa America.</p>
      <p>Messi netted the only goal of the game at the King Saud University Stadium on 13 minutes, tapping home the rebound after his penalty was saved by Brazil goalkeeper Alisson.</p>
      <p>His effort came shortly after Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus rolled a spot-kick wide for Brazil, who were playing without the injured Neymar.</p>
      <p>Messi, who scored with a pair of free-kicks in his last game with Barcelona, twice threatened from set pieces in the second half before Liverpool 'keeper Alisson beat away a powerful drive from Paredes.</p>
      <p>Rodrygo, the 18-year-old who scored a sensational Champions League hat-trick with Real Madrid this month, made his Brazil debut as he replaced Willian for the final 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>However, Brazil were unable to find an equaliser as their winless run since capturing the Copa America title extended to five matches.</p>
      <p>The meeting between the two South American giants was the second in Saudi Arabia in little over a year. Brazil beat Argentina 1-0 in Jeddah in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Brazil also defeated Argentina 2-0 at home in the semi-finals of this year's Copa America, a controversial match that left Messi complaining the hosts had benefited from favouritism.</p>
      <p>Brazil will play a friendly against South Korea in Abu Dhabi on November 19, in their final game before South American qualifying starts for the 2022 World Cup in March.</p>
