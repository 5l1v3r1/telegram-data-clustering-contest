      <p>Roland Rudd has quit as de facto chairman of the People’s Vote after weeks of open warfare among senior figures inside the group campaigning for a second referendum.</p>
      <p>The multimillionaire founder of Finsbury PR — and brother of former cabinet minister Amber Rudd — has also resigned from Open Britain, the largest group within the broader People’s Vote campaign, although he will stay on its board.</p>
      <p>Mr Rudd was caught in a tussle for power with a group of former New Labour operatives, including former business minister Peter Mandelson and one-time spin-doctor Alastair Campbell.</p>
      <p>He has been replaced as chair of Open Britain by Anne Weyman, a former chief executive of the Family Planning Association. Her deputy will be Geeta Sidhu-Robb, founder of Nosh Detox, a nutrition business.</p>
      <p>Mr Rudd told colleagues during the summer that he wanted to stand down in due course, preferably for a female successor.</p>
      <p>But his departure is likely to be seen through the prism of the highly public row within the organisation over whether it should openly back a Remain position.</p>
      <p>Last month the Financial Times revealed that Mr <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3da6d7f0-f90a-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6">Rudd had ousted two allies </a>of Lord Mandelson and Mr Campbell: James McGrory, leader of the People’s Vote campaign, and Tom Baldwin, its head of press.</p>
      <p>That “coup” led to walkouts by many staff, some of whom have not yet returned to work.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr Rudd hired Patrick Heneghan, a former Labour official, to be the new director of the organisation.</p>
      <p>But he stepped down last week pending an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment, which he denies. Mr Heneghan has in turn been replaced as acting chief by former Tory official Stuart Hand.</p>
      <p>The hopes among Remainers of another EU referendum appear to be fading given that Boris Johnson’s Conservative party has — at present — <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/263615ca-d873-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17">a strong lead in the opinion polls</a> with less than month to go before the general election.</p>
      <p>Ms Weyman told The Times newspaper that she was excited to be leading such a talented and dedicated group of people.</p>
      <p>“I’m honoured to be taking charge of Open Britain at this crucial time for Britain’s future and I want to thank Roland for his considerable achievements in helping to establish this movement,” she said. “We are eager to resolve any outstanding issues with staff in a professional manner, as swiftly as possible.”</p>
