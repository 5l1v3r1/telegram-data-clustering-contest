      <h1>Meek Mill Teases New Album Before the End of 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:23:21+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/zoejohnson/" target="_blank">Zoe Johnson</a></address>
      <p>2019 is winding down and it looks like <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/meek-mill/">Meek Mill </a>is planning to end things with a musical bang.</p>
      <p>On Thursday (Nov. 14), he responded to a fan's #AskMeek question about the possibility of him dropping a new project before the end of 2019. In his response, he hinted that he could be dropping a new album this year.</p>
      <p>"I'ma set this shit straight just to be in the convo of the 2019 albums," Meek wrote in a tweet hinting at plans to drop an LP that could be talked about as one of the year's best.</p>

      <p>If Meek is being serious about this, the Philly-native will be returning with a follow up to his 2018 LP, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Championships-Explicit-Meek-Mill/dp/B07KZ2GX6C?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B07KZ2GX6C">Championships</a></i>, this year. The album, which features artists like <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/cardi-b/">Cardi B</a>, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/jay-z/">Jay-Z</a>, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/rick-ross/">Rick Ross </a>and<a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/11/meek-mill-championships-album-drake-feature/"> Drake</a>, quickly <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/reviews/2018/12/meek-mill-championships-album-review/">earned critical acclaim</a> for hard-hitting lyrics that depict Meek's internal battles both before and after his release from prison.</p>
      <p>"I used to be a honor roll student, damn, then I turned to a beast/The first time I seen a nigga get some blood on his sneaks," Meek raps on the title track for his latest album. "He had on Air Max 93s but was slumped in the street/His mama cryin', that did somethin' to me, oh Lord/The shit I'm doin' for my hood I won't get an award/I used to sell Reggie, damn how' I get to the <i>Forbes</i>."</p>
      <p>While fans are ready for Meek to grace them with some new music, there is no guarantee that the Dreamchaser will actually unload a new project this year. <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/08/meek-mill-new-music-summer/">Back in August</a>, Meek promised to drop a pack of music before the summer ended while responding to similar tweets from a fan. However, once summer ended, there was no music from the <i>Dreams and Nightmares</i> rhymer.</p>
      <p>Here's to hoping Meek drops off a new LP soon.</p>
