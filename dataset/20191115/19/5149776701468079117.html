      <h1>Port Vale hoping 'decent' relationship with Nottingham Forest will help them keep youngster</h1>
      <h2>Young Reds midfielder Jake Taylor has been a regular for Vale since making the short-term loan move along the A50</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:44:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:44</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Port Vale are hoping to extend Jake Taylor’s loan deal from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest,</a> after the midfielder’s impressive start to life at Vale Park.</p>
      <p>The Forest youngster has caught the eye in the Potteries, scoring four times in 15 games including the winner against Crewe last month, with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/what-surprised-nottingham-forest-youngster-3342852">the League Two outfit</a> hopeful of keeping him.</p>
      <p>Valiants boss John Askey hopes the good relationship the club have with Forest will reflect well on their chances of securing a deal for the 21-year-old beyond <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-midfielder-set-league-3267271">the current one</a> which runs until January.</p>
      <p>Askey has also revealed Vale owners Carol and Kevin Shanahan arranged a car for Taylor to use, after his was broken into during the week, further evidence, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/port-vale-boss-wants-extend-3408523">Askey</a> believes, that Vale are doing right by their players and making them feel valued.</p>

      <p>"I know there will be one or two clubs looking but we have a decent relationship with Gary Brazil who played here who looks after Jake at Forest, so they can see he is being looked after,” he told Stoke-on-Trent Live.</p>
      <p>"That's where Carol has come in this week.</p>
      <p>"Jake had his car broken into and Carol fixed him up with a car within two hours of it happening. Things like that can go a long way.</p>
      <p>"So, where a lot of football clubs would just say 'get on with it', we are seeing that we are taking care of players now.</p>
      <p>"It means a lot when you are at work and people care about you, you go out of your way to do that little bit extra."</p>
