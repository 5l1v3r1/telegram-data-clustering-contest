      <p>It’s been nearly 3 years since <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/george-michael/">George Michael</a> died on Christmas Day in 2016, but he’s still in the hearts and minds of many fans.</p>
      <p>So <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emilia-clarke/">Emilia Clarke</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/when-is-the-last-christmas-movie-coming-out-and-what-has-it-got-to-do-with-george-michael-11046708/">latest film Last Christmas</a> is going to be a welcome treat for fans of the late singer.</p>
      <p>The movie doesn’t just borrow the title of Wham!’s iconic Christmas song – the soundtrack is comprised of George Michael’s solo hits, with songs from his Wham! Days and a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/george-michael-released-new-song-three-years-death-11055494/">previously-unreleased new track</a>.</p>
      <p>As the film lands in cinemas across the UK, let’s take a look back at how we lost the pop icon 3 years ago…</p>

      <h3>What did George Michael die of?</h3>
      <p>George Michael’s death was from natural causes.</p>
      <p>The pop star was reportedly suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver, according to a 2017 statement from Darren Salter, senior coroner for Oxfordshire.</p>

      <p>Out of the conditions listed, the cardiomyopathy and myocarditis meant that his heart was enlarged, weakened and inflamed, so the muscle wasn’t doing the job of pumping blood properly.</p>

      <p>Andrew Ridgeley, his Wham! bandmate, admitted previously that he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/04/george-michaels-best-friend-wham-star-andrew-ridgeley-still-questions-singers-death-10858968/">still has questions about the singer’s death</a>, writing in his autobiography: ‘It now seems as if we may never know what really happened.’</p>
