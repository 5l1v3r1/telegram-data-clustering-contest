      <p>Football legend Didier Drogba helped launch a drive on Friday to plant a million trees to halt deforestation in Ivory Coast.</p>
      <p>The "One Day, One Million Trees" campaign "is a first step, the start of the recovery", Forestry and Water Resources Minister Alain Richard Donwahi said in Abidjan, the country's main city.</p>
      <p>"Our goal is to recover at least 30% (of lost forest cover) by 2030," he said.</p>
      <p>Most of Ivory Coast's 20 000km<sup>2Â </sup>of forests are considered badly degraded.</p>
      <p>Drogba said the "numbers are alarming", referring to projections that the tropical West African nation would lose all its forest cover in half a century if corrective steps were not taken.</p>
      <p>"I am proud to contribute to Ivory Coast's reforestation through helping awareness," the former Chelsea star said, describing the tree planting as a "noble initiative."</p>
      <p>Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer and a major coffee exporter, plans to reforest eight million hectaresby 2045.</p>
