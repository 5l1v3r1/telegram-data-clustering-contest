      <p>, the socio political thriller produced by Dreamscape Entertainment and Rein Entertainment for iWant, premiered on the popular streaming site. </p>
      <p>Picking up from where the previous season left off, which sparked conversations and resonated with viewers, who applauded its unapologetic and eye-opening exploration of relevant social issues, lead star <b>Arjo Atayde </b></p>
      <p>returns to his role as the streetsmart and power-hungry Gov. Benjo Malaya, a barber-turned-bagman-turned-politician who was fighting for his life after his attempted assassination.</p>

          <i>'Bagman' is a  socio-political thriller produced by Dreamscape Entertainment and Rein Entertainment for iWant.</i>

      <p>Arjo is joined by <b>Carlo Aquino </b></p>
      <p>who both find a formidable foe in each other as they put their lives on the line in the new season of the socio-political statement piece.</p>
      <p>Fortunate to survive the blow, Benjo pulls out all the stops to determine the mastermind behind the plan, as well as the hitman who tried to kill him, Emman (Carlo), while continuing to carry out his responsibilities as the governor of Magdiwang.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Emman (Carlo) faces the consequences of his failure to end the life of Benjo and grows desperate to prove his worth by once again carrying out the mission under the orders of Rep. Ricardo Matias (<b>Romnick Sarmenta</b></p>
      <p>).</p>

      <p> Benjo’s and Emman’s crooked paths repeatedly cross, and Benjo starts to put together the clues that will lead him to discovering the identity of his killer.</p>
      <p> As Benjo and Emman sacrifice their principles and get their hands dirty to one-up each other, who will come out alive?</p>
      <p>“I want <i>Bagman</i> to go places and expand into many seasons. There are a lot of things that we could do with the story and the characters. There are so many plots to explore,” Arjo told <i>Manila Standard </i></p>
      <p>during a brief chat after the special screening of the digital series held at Santolan Town Plaza cinema.</p>
      <p>“We’re glad that the series had a second season and of course we wanted to have an extension. Who wouldn’t want that?” he added.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Bagman</i>
      </p>
      <p>remains to be the most streamed content on iWant and Arjo couldn’t thank his fans and supporters enough for promoting the series. </p>
      <p>“It happened through word of mouth and it makes me proud that the series stands out because of the plot and how it is executed,” he shared. </p>
      <p>The series’ return not only marks another deep-dive into the brutal world of politics and corruption but also the coming together of two of the most acclaimed young actors of today.</p>
