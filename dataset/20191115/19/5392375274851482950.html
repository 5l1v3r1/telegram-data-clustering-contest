      <p>The Galaxy A51 will kick off the new generation of Galaxy A-smartphones. The original Galaxy A50 was one of Samsung’s greatest hits in 2019, and it’s natural to see the company preparing a worthy successor for the handset. The upcoming smartphone already made an appearance on the realms of GeekBench with the SM-A515F model number. A few days ago, the same device grabbed Wi-Fi Alliance approval hinting. Now, there’s more evidence that its launch will be sooner than we expect.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> is quiet about the Galaxy A51, but it has been with every other Galaxy A-release. For instance, the Galaxy A70s, appeared through a series of leaks to suddenly be released. Knowing this, we don’t expect an invite to come several days before the Galaxy A51 release. The South-Korean firm has just updated its official <a href="https://www.samsung.com/ru/support/model/SM-A515FZWMSER/">Russian site</a> with the support page of the Galaxy A51. It’s a great hint of the device’s imminent arrival.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, a couple of CAD renders surfaced showing the device’s upcoming design. On the front, we’ll get a 6.5-inch display with FHD+ resolution and a punch-hole for the selfie camera. It’s a single 32MP selfie snapper that will be placed in the middle. We have to say, this kind of placement follows Note 10 guidelines and is much less distracting than the corner-placed punch holes. On the back, we expect to see an L-shaped Quad-Camera setup comprising a 48MP main sensor, 12MP Ultra-Wide, 12MP Telephone, and 5MP depth sensor modules.</p>

      <p>According to GeekBench listing, it will sport an Exynos 9611 SoC which comes paired with 4GB of RAM and probably 128GB of Storage. The handset draws power from a 4,000mAh battery which should be charged via 18W fast-charging. It will run Android 10 straight out the box with One UI 2.0 running atop.</p>
