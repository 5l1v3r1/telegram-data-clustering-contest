      <h1>Gareth Bale says playing for Wales 'more exciting' than Real Madrid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:49:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/james-candy/" target="_blank">James Candy</a></address>
      <p>The Wales fans who have traversed Europe with hopes of witnessing their team take a leap towards another major tournament will unfurl a brand new banner in honour of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/gareth-balei-dont-pay-attention-news-dont-even-know-prime/">their talisman Gareth Bale</a>.</p>
      <p>A national flag emblazoned with “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/07/31/zinedine-zidane-reminds-gareth-bale-real-madrid-responsibilities/">Wales, Golf, Madrid</a> – In that order” will make its international debut in Baku referencing Real Madrid legend Predrag Mijatovic’s claim that the 30-year-old firmly prioritised country over club.</p>
      <p>Bale last played for the Spanish giants on Oct 5 and did not return to full training under Zinedine Zidane following last month’s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Slovakia and Croatia.</p>
      <p>But he looks set to play another leading role for Ryan Giggs’s side in the decisive games against Azerbaijan and Hungary, and Bale admits his fires burns brightest for Wales.</p>
      <p>“It’s the goal that will come first,” said Bale on qualifying for another European Championship. “It’s something I think everyone knows - how passionate I am about Wales.</p>
      <p>“We want to qualify for multiple tournaments. It’s not just important for the here and now but also for the future of Welsh football and make our national team better for the future.</p>

      <p>“I’ve been with most of these players since we were in Under-17s. It’s like playing down the park with your mates.</p>
      <p>“With Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feel more comfortable. I definitely have more excitement when I play with Wales, but I always give 100 per cent on the pitch wherever I am, that’s what I always strive to do. </p>
      <p>The Real superstar has been under constant criticism from the Spanish media despite helping to win a quartet of Champions League trophies.</p>
      <p>Most of the photographs splashed across the sports pages of the national papers are of Bale out on the golf course instead of starring on the pitch.</p>
      <p>It will take a Herculean effort to get through 180 minutes of international football in four days after training away from the main squad at his club for the past month.</p>
      <p>But Bale believes he is ready to make another huge impact for his country after laughing off the headlines and escaping to his international oasis.</p>
      <p>“I find it hilarious to be honest, especially some of the pictures that my friends send me of the headlines,” he added. “One sent a picture of a triple bogey, I’ve never had one! The people don’t know what they’re on about. I find it really funny.</p>

      <p>“I’ve heard some stories, but I don’t take notice. My friends tend to send me pictures of what they write. I’ve tried to get back as quickly as I could. If Real Madrid had a game this weekend I’d be fit to play, so to them it doesn’t look good, but if I’m fit, no matter where I am I’m going to try to play, whether it’s Wales or Real Madrid.” </p>
      <p>Giggs has another of his star men at his disposal in the form of Aaron Ramsey, who is set for a Wales return a year after his last appearance at the crucial moment.</p>
      <p>The Juventus midfielder will fill the void left by the suspended Joe Allen, with fellow Euro 2016 hero Ashley Williams also in line for a start after a resurgent spell with Bristol City.</p>
      <p>A pair of victories would likely seal qualification unless Slovakia picked up six points from their final two games as Giggs aims to put 2016 in the past.</p>
      <p>“I’ve not had Aaron Ramsey in the squad, so it’s good to have him back,” the Wales manager said. “Like Gareth, the shortage of game time is something I’m going to have to look at, but it’s good to have Aaron back with the squad.</p>
      <p>“It has been squeaky bum time for the last few games. They’re two big games. Obviously you’re running out of matches to qualify.</p>
      <p>“We’re just focused on tomorrow and winning the game. It’s as simple as that. The players are ready, they’re looking forward to it.”</p>
