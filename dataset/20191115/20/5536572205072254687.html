      <h1>Steelers Fans Starts GoFundMe To Pay Maurkice Pouncey’s Fine For Defending Mason Rudolph</h1>

      <p>Pittsburgh Steelers fans want to put their money where their mouth is. The fan base wants to help cover the fine levied to Maurkice Pouncey for his role in the Thursday night brawl against the Cleveland Browns.</p>
      <p>It was Myles Garrett who grabbed at Maosn Rudolph’s helmet and took it off when he unexpectedly swung it and hit him over the head with it. Rudolph’s teammates were pissed, but none more than Maurkice Pouncey who came in swinging multiple punches and kicking Garrett in the head for his actions.</p>

      <p>On Friday, Pouncey was suspended three games without pay and fined an additional amount by the NFL. Steelers fans created a GoFundMe with the goal of raising $50,000 for the Steelers center.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/pay-maurkice-pouncey039s-fine-for-defending-mason">GoFundMe reads as</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Browns Defensive end Myles Garrett (scumbag) assaulted Mason Ruldoph following a scrum when Garrett threw Rudolph to the ground late on a pass with 8 seconds left. He hit Rudolph with his helmet after he ripped it off his head.<br/><br/>Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey jumped into the action to defend his QB and surely will be fined an unreasonable amount. So SteelerNation let’s raise as much as we can to help Pouncey for doing the absolute right thing.”</blockquote>
      <p>If Pouncey decides not to accept the money, the GoFundMe organizer said it will be donated to a charity of his choosing.</p>
      <p>As of Friday afternoon, the GoFundMe has raised over $1,328.</p>
