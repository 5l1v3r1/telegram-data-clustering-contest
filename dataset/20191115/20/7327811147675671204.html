      <p>SOUNDVIEW, Bronx (WABC) -- Police are asking for the public's help solving a violent robbery at a Bronx recording studio that left an employee hospitalized.</p>
      <p>It happened just after midnight Wednesday inside Wayne World Records on Morrison Avenue in the Soundview section and was caught on surveillance camera.</p>
      <p>Video from inside the studio shows a masked gunman pushing the victim to the ground.</p>
      <p>A second man with a gun leaves his face uncovered as both men rob the place of cash and electronics before running away.</p>
      <p>As they fled, the 30-year-old robbery victim decided to get in his car and follow them.</p>
      <p>He ended up getting shot in the shoulder. His car windshield was shattered, and the gunman got away.</p>
      <p>The victim was hospitalized, his condition described as stable.</p>
      <p>The recording studio is usually open 24 hours a day, but nobody answered when Eyewitness News called the studio's office Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Neighbors said they are not surprised to see violence at the facility.</p>
      <p>"This block is hot, real hot," Miguel Avilla said. "Every time there's a shooting here, real hot."</p>
      <p>A $2500 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction.</p>
      <p>"As soon as this came over here, it's been issues," Amoura S. said. "I'm not saying they're bad people. I don't think they're bad people. They're pretty nice to me, but what's real is real. Ain't nobody stupid."</p>
      <p>If you recognize either suspect, you can call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).</p>
