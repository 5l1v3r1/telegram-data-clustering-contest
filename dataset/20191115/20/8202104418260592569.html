      <h1>Sporting Christmas lends a helping hand, as Salvation Army ramps up its hamper program</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:21:39+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:21</time> by <a rel="author">Kevin Mitchell, Saskatoon StarPhoenix</a></address>
      <p>We're closing in on $2 million all-time; should hit it very shortly, and it's a milestone worth celebrating.</p>

      <h3>We’ve been doing it a long time, this Sporting Christmas, and oh, have we watched it grow.</h3>
      <p>Its roots run deep in this city. People write us every year, telling us how Sporting Christmas is a family or personal tradition. When the weather turns cold, the snow flies, and the calendar flips, flips, flips, they turn their thoughts to the Salvation Army, and its remarkable work on behalf of Saskatoon’s most vulnerable people.</p>

        <b>Click <a href="https://secure.salvationarmy.ca/registrant/donate.aspx?eventid=106862&amp;langpref=en-CA&amp;Referrer=direct%2fnone">here to donate online to the StarPhoenix Sporting Christmas</a> campaign</b>
      </p>
      <p>—–</p>
      <p>We raise money every season for the Sally Ann’s Christmas hamper program. We’re closing in on $2 million all-time; should hit it very shortly, and it’s a milestone worth celebrating.</p>
      <p>StarPhoenix columnist Larry Tucker first came up with the concept in 1976. He had the idea that this newspaper, so deeply embedded in the community, had a real chance to make a difference. Tucker knew the Christmas season isn’t easy for many families in this area; that many folks struggle with the things so many of us take for granted — a turkey on the table, a gift for the child.</p>
      <p>The now-defunct Winnipeg Tribune had a similar fund, one they’d copied over from a newspaper in Toronto, and when Tucker told the Tribune’s Jack Matheson that he envisioned something similar in Saskatoon, “he wished me well and told me to get after you folks,” Tucker wrote.</p>
      <p>Matheson personally chipped in $10, and they raised $8,345 that first year. Tucker wrote about an elderly man, Alex Scott, who stopped by the office with $5 in quarters clutched in his hands. He couldn’t make it up our winding front staircase, and asked if Tucker could come down to get the gift.</p>
      <p>People like Scott are the backbone of what we do.</p>
      <p>So we’re back for a 44th year, I’m so happy to say, and you’re all invited to join us. We closed out last year’s campaign with an all-time total of $1,984,699.09. A $2,500 cheque from Nutrien came in the day after we closed things out — they’re an annual donor to our cause, and the money they’ve sent our way has fed untold numbers of area people — and we’re updating our all-time, post-2018 total to $1,987,199.09 (not counting today’s donations).</p>
      <p>We’ll hit $2 million in very short order.</p>
      <p>What do those Christmas hampers do? They provide a week’s worth of Christmas-season food, including a turkey or ham, as well as gifts for the kids. Stories abound of the people who receive those hampers, and the joy and relief it brings.</p>
      <p>That’s why we do this.</p>
      <p>A couple of longtime donors give us a nice kick-start today as we get the 2019 campaign off the ground. The CIBC Funseekers, who have donated to our cause for more than two decades, pool their donations to us every year in memory of Forrest Conklin.</p>
      <p>And we get a generous gift every season from an anonymous local donor who this year gives in memory of his brother.</p>
      <p>There’s one wrinkle this year in the way we do things, and I’ll stress it again over the next few weeks: Because of privacy concerns, if you send us a donation, we can only provide the Salvation Army with your information for tax-receipt purposes if you <b>specifically provide permission for us to do so</b>. If you mail us a cheque, send us a card, or donate online, please let us know you want a tax receipt. For those who use our donation forms, we’ve revised them to make it easier to provide that permission.</p>
      <p>And if you don’t want a receipt, well, no need to do anything extra!</p>
      <p>We deeply appreciate those who give today, and those who donate over the next month and a half as we seek to help people in our midst.</p>
      <p>
