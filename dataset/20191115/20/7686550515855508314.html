      <p>These are the winning numbers for tonight's Euromillions draw and Thunderball.</p>
      <p>The jackpot for Friday, November 15, was a massive £98m. If you bought a ticket you can check your numbers below.</p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
      <p>The winning numbers were: 20, 13, 34, 03, 32.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s lucky stars were: 04 and 11.</p>
      <h3>How many numbers do you need to win?</h3>
      <p>If you have got two numbers or one number and two lucky stars or better then you are a winner.</p>
      <p>Players must match all five main numbers and two lucky star numbers to claim the jackpot.</p>
      <p>The Thunderball draw was also made tonight.</p>
      <p><b>The winning Thunderball numbers were: </b>16, 17, 28, 32, 39.</p>
      <p><b>The Thunderball was</b>: 13</p>
      <p>In June 2019 a single ticketholder in the UK won £123m in the Tuesday night EuroMillions draw. It was the third biggest EuroMillions jackpot in the UK since the draw launched in 2004.</p>
      <p>It meant they instantly became as rich as Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James (£127m) and Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page (£125m).</p>
      <p>But they are not the biggest Euromillions winner. That title belongs to Colin and Chris Weir, from North Ayrshire in Scotland, who won £161m in 2011, making them the current record holders for the biggest ever lottery win in the UK. They made a £1m donation to the Scottish National Party following their lottery win.</p>
      <p>In 2012 Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, won more than £148m. Both couples have separated since winning the Euromillions jackpot.</p>
      <p>Although EuroMillions is played in nine European countries four of the biggest jackpots in 2019 have been claimed in the UK.</p>
