      <p>James Charles and <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/youtube/">YouTube</a> are looking for the next big beauty <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/influencer/">influencer</a>.</p>
      <p>Today, the social media giant unveiled plans for its first <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/jaclyn-hill-talks-jaclyn-cosmetics-relaunch-1203369741/">YouTube</a> Originals beauty competition series, to be fronted by Charles. The famed 20-year-old YouTuber, who has more than 16 million subscribers, will lead YouTube’s four-part series, which will premiere in 2020. Charles’ content creator friends, along with beauty industry veterans, are expected to make appearances.</p>
      <p>“James Charles is a leader in the industry when it comes to pushing boundaries with creative content,” said Susanne Daniels, global head of original content for YouTube, in a statement, going on to praise “his energy and talent” that will be on display in YouTube Originals’ first beauty competition series.</p>

      <p>“Reality competition shows have always been a guilty pleasure of mine, and ever since I became a content creator on YouTube, it’s been one of my biggest dreams to create my own,” said Charles in a statement. “Beauty is such a major industry, and I’ve been lucky enough to grow a huge platform, but now I want to give back and share the knowledge I’ve gathered with others. Being a superstar <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/media/liketoknow-its-journey-from-influencers-to-magazines-1203371956/">influencer</a> takes a whole lot more than just blending eye shadow, and I can’t wait to find out who has what it takes to make it to the top. Producing my own show for YouTube is going to be a crazy challenge but I’m so ready…and hopefully the beauty community is, too.”</p>
      <p>Charles shared news of the forthcoming untitled series on his YouTube channel this afternoon, opening up a casting call to his fans. The YouTuber has had a troubled year, including <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/james-charles-tati-westbrook-and-the-chaos-of-cancel-culture-1203136091/">a public feud</a> that caused him to lose millions of subscribers. In the past few months, he has regained his following, become <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/james-charles-top-influencer-nyfw-1203286793/">the top influencer at New York Fashion Week</a> and launched <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/james-charles-talks-shifting-influencer-sphere-morphe-launching-his-own-beauty-brand-1203352469/">a second collaboration with Morphe</a>.</p>
      <p>YouTube’s forthcoming competition series is produced by Brian Graden Media, the company behind the Streamy Award-winning YouTube Originals “Escape the Night.” New episodes will drop weekly. All will be available to stream for free on YouTube.</p>
