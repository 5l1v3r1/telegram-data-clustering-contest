      <h1>Bar offers women free drinks based on how much they weigh</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:31:13+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:31</time> by <a rel="author">Nadine DeNinno</a></address>
      <p>At this bar in the United Arab Emirates, every pound counts.</p>
      <p>A club in Dubai is hosting a promotion offering women free drinks based on how much they weigh, <a href="https://www.insider.com/dubai-bar-offering-women-free-drinks-equal-to-their-weight-2019-11">reports Insider</a> — but less doesn’t mean more.</p>
      <p>Fusion Club at the <a href="https://www.cassellsalbarshahotel.com/en/">Cassells Al Barsha Hotel</a> says the higher the number on the scale, the more free hooch you can get. But sorry, boys, it’s for ladies only.</p>
      <p>Female patrons can redeem the promotion by weighing themselves on a designated scale at the entrance. Guests can also opt for a “discreet” option by writing their weight on a piece of paper for a bartender, which doesn’t require authentication, because the bar’s management respects the “magnanimity of our lady guests.”</p>
      <p>“We do not insist our guests to verify the weight,” manager Anil Kumar tells Insider. “We trust them and just serve whatever number they wrote on the paper without asking questions.”</p>

      <p>The promotion, which runs through the end of the year, includes a seemingly positive tagline — “It’s Good To Gain Weight!” — and Kumar says the establishment doesn’t “see any reason to feel any bad intention about the offer.”</p>
      <p>Still, local social media reactions have been decidedly mixed, <a href="https://lovindubai.com/dubai/dubai-residents-have-weighed-in-on-the-bar-that-offers-ladies-drinks-rates-based-on-weight">Lovin Dubai reports</a>.</p>
      <p>“We wanted the ladies to surprise their partners and friends that it’s good to gain weight!” Kumar says. “We don’t have to be too serious on everything. Dubai is a city for entertainment and fun.”</p>
      <p>So how much booze does a pound yield? At Fusion Club, every kilogram is equal to one Emirati dirham (AED), the currency of the United Arab Emirates. So a woman who weighs 150 pounds can get $68 AED-worth of any drinks at the bar, which is about $18.50.</p>
