      <p>CULVER CITY, CALIF – “JEOPARDY! James” Holzhauer lived up to his nickname today when he defeated Emma Boettcher and Francois Barcomb to win the prestigious Tournament of Champions and claim its $250,000 grand prize. Boettcher came in second, earning $100,000, while Barcomb took third, netting $50,000.</p>
      <p>The Tournament of Champions (TOC) finals was the second time Holzhauer and Boettcher faced off on the JEOPARDY! stage; their first meeting was in June 2019, when Boettcher beat Holzhauer and ended his 32-game winning streak.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve said all along that Emma is an all-time great player, and I’m proud it took that level of competitor to defeat me,” Holzhauer said. “Now the world sees that I wasn’t just making excuses. Francois certainly looked as dominant as either of us in his first two games, so I knew the finals would be a fight to the finish. But the whole point of the TOC is to play the best of the best, and Emma and Francois certainly proved that they belonged in the final three.”</blockquote>
      <p>With the addition of his Tournament of Champions prize money, Holzhauer’s regular season and tournament winnings now total $2,712,216, a figure that puts him behind only two other players in JEOPARDY! history: Brad Rutter, whose $4,688,436 make him the highest-winning game show contestant of all time, and Ken Jennings, whose all-time earnings total $3,370,700.</p>
      <p>The JEOPARDY! Tournament of Champions was presented by Consumer Cellular. To learn more about the tournament, please visit Jeopardy.com.</p>
