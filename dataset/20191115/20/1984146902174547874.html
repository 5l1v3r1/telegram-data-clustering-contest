      <h2>Paul Cox, of Durham, was told he has six months to prove he can stay offence-free or he will be jailed</h2>

      <p>A drug addict with 231 previous convictions who was caught smuggling narcotics into a prison has been given six months to prove he can stay out of trouble.</p>
      <p>Paul Cox was visiting an inmate at HMP Northumberland when he was spotted handing over a package containing 50 xanax tablets.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old went on to steal hundreds of pounds worth of meat and chocolates during a series of shop thefts, Newcastle Crown Court.</p>
      <p>He was facing a prison sentence but a judge decided to give him until next March to see if he can remain offence free - promising if he does, he may consider sparing him custody.</p>
      <p>Recorder Paul Reid told Cox: "You are facing a period inside again and that is the almost inevitable outcome or would have been were I to sentence you today.</p>
      <p>"But the sentence for this lengthy period of appalling behaviour cannot be measured in years, rather in months.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to defer the sentencing hearing until March 6.</p>
      <p>"You have to stay out of trouble. If you do, when you come back, having had a period free of offending, the chances are I will impose a custodial sentence but will suspend it. So it's a matter entirely for you."</p>
      <p>The court heard it was on March 21 last year that Cox went to HMP Northumberland.</p>
      <p>During a visit, he was seen reaching down into his trousers, bringing something out and placing it on a table, which the prisoner slid across the table to himself.</p>
      <p>Cox, of Redwood Flats, Brandon, County Durham, told police pressure was being put on the inmate, whose relative he was living with, and he agreed to help.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to conveying a banned article into prison and nine offences of theft from shops - including high value meat and chocolates.</p>
      <p>The court heard of his 231 previous convictions, 136 are for acquisitive crime, mainly shop thefts and he also previously served a seven year sentence for supplying heroin.</p>
      <p>Michael Hodson, defending, said: "His antecedents are quite frankly appalling.</p>
      <p>"He was stealing items which were easily sold and are attributable to his addiction.</p>
      <p>"He owed debts because he is a drug addict and he was encouraged to take those drugs into prison, no doubt to pay off some drug debt."</p>
      <p>Mr Hodson added that Cox was the carer for his mentally ill partner and he had also been attacked with pepper or CS gas.</p>
