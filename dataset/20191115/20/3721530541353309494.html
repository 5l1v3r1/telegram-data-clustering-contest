      <h1>Report: BioWare doubling down on Anthem, might bring it back as ‘Anthem 2.0’</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Owen S. Good</a></address>
      <p>BioWare is working to overhaul and redeploy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/anthem/39894"><i>Anthem</i></a><i> — </i>potentially as an all-new product on shelves — <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">according to a Kotaku report</a> quoting anonymous sources at the studio. EA itself declined to comment on the story.</p>
      <p>The salvage operation hints at the present state of the multiplayer loot-shooter, which has seen big-name project managers depart recently, and was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/12/20863220/anthem-ea-access-origin-access-pc-ps4-xbox-one-list-of-games-september-2019">dumped into the EA Access catalog</a> seven months after its February launch.</p>
      <p>Still, “Anthem 2.0,” or “Anthem Next,” as it is reportedly being informally referred to, will deliver a “drastically” changed game, involving the mission structure, loot and world itself, according to Kotaku’s Jason Schreier.</p>
      <p><i>Anthem </i>launched in almost complete dysfunction, with performance problems and a bland design that failed to deliver on the game’s marketing hype. Kotaku <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">also detailed the manifold problems</a> in <i>Anthem</i>’s conception and development back in April, which drew <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/2/18292245/bioware-anthem-development-official-statement-response">a very defensive reply</a> from BioWare and Electronic Arts.</p>
      <p>Not soon after, BioWare began <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/24/18514053/anthem-cataclysm-event-delayed-bioware">backtracking on an ambitious 90-day roadmap of post-launch support</a> that developers had drawn up. That delayed, by three months, the release of Cataclysm, end-game content that is a staple of the open-world, massively multiplayer loot shooters that <i>Anthem </i>was meant to compete with. Cataclysm <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/6/20757078/anthem-patch-cataclysm-activity-masterwork-notes-javelin-armor-weapon-melee-ability-mission">finally arrived in August</a>, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/bwqo27/what_the_cataclysm_isand_is_not/">failed to energize the game’s remaining player base</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">Kotaku’s report</a> cautions that “many of the details are still in flux, and there’s no clear timeline” for <i>Anthem</i>’s makeover, whatever it entails. Developers are considering a series of updates similar to what was seen with <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, which struggled during its launch in 2016, but recovered in 2018 with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/27/17619906/no-mans-sky-next-review-update">a comprehensive update called <i>No Man’s Sky Next</i></a>.</p>
      <p>BioWare could also release “<i>Anthem</i> 2.0” as an entirely new game, Kotaku reported, though it’s unlikely that original <i>Anthem </i>owners would be forced to purchase the game again.</p>
      <p>Still “It’s safe to say that <i>Anthem </i>won’t suddenly transform into a brand-new franchise,” Kotaku says. “BioWare’s plan is to zoom out and overhaul the gameplay systems that most have agreed don’t work.”</p>
      <p>Kotaku, of course, has a lot more detail; <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">you should check it out</a>.</p>
