      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not believe his Twitter posts were intimidating after his real-time attack on former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch drew criticism during a public hearing in an impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think so at all,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked whether his tweets or words can be intimidating. Trump said he watched a little bit of the second public impeachment hearing on Friday and “thought it was a disgrace.”</p>
      <p>Democrats had accused Trump of witness intimidation after he said “everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad.”</p>
