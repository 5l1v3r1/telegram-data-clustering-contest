      <h1>Why women should accompany their men to the salon</h1>

      <p><b>Why men are frequent customers to the Saloons these days. <br/></b> <br/>  <br/>It’s a basic part of our human nature to always want to look and feel good. A visit to the saloon comes in mandatory. However, for most men, a visit to the salon shouldn’t consume more than 20 minutes. Not anymore.  <br/> <br/>In Kampala, barbers are now dedicating a lot of time to grooming. You can count on your hair to be washed, cut, oiled and massaged. It is the massaging bit that should raise a red flag to wives and girlfriends.  <br/> <br/>With stiff competition, Saloons in town now strive to create an experience for customers. A bevy of vibrant, chatty and infectious ladies are on cue to unleash the experience, which can lead to an eruption of pleasure if you have a ‘weak heart’. <br/> <br/>I’ve always heard men talk about visiting the saloon more than once in a week just for ‘happy endings’ but I was always dismissive. This, until I tried out one of those saloons that charge sh10, 000 for a haircut.  Have you ever walked out of a saloon with your trousers locked in a tight embrace with your nether regions?  That was me after the haircut.  <br/> </p>

      <p> <br/>For this particular saloon in Kireka, things got bloody. I am used to a barber doing his stuff and applying aftershave after the haircut.  At this particular saloon, which teemed with middle-aged male clients, things panned out a little differently.  <br/> <br/>It was like a clip from a soft porn movie. There she stood, positioning me in a spot where my head was between her boobs. She unbuttoned my shirt.  What I assumed would be a 2-minute scalp massage went on for 20 minutes.  <br/>With each passing minute, I became powerless to tell her to stop. I felt the military alert nipples rubbing against me.  <br/> <br/>With a face already covered in wax, I closed my eyes but I had happiness etched on my face. She went on and on. My purpose of visiting was a haircut but she seemed to focus on finding all hairy spots on my body. <br/> <br/>A hair cut in this suburb costs anywhere between sh2000 to sh15,000. After this experience, sh10, 000 felt like nothing. It was more than value for money and a tip had to come in handy!   <br/> </p>

      <p>I heard stories of a wife who caused a scene at this particular saloon. She was livid and hurt stating that her husband was being unfaithful to her and that the massage he had received was no different than an affair.</p>
      <p>The husband claimed that he did not go to the massage parlor with the intent of receiving a “happy ending”, but rather it was offered he simply went along with it.<br/> <br/>Twaha Mujabi, a manager at the saloon reveals that the reception has been quite overwhelming.<br/>‘‘We wanted to raise the bar in male grooming in Kampala. We’ve brought quality service and professionalism similar to what we have seen happening in other parts of the world.’’ Many men use alcohol-based products, which dry their skin causing pimples and premature aging.  We are here to change the game,” he said.  <br/> <br/>He says that not many men are comfortable with the massage; they leave immediately after the haircut. This also costs sh10,000,” he says. </p>
