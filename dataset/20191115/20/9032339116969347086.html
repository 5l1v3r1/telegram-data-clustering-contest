        <li>Protestors disrupted a dinner honoring Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh yesterday by playing <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a23491522/read-dr-christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaughs-opening-remarks-thursday-hearing/">Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony</a> outside of the venue and blowing whistles during the justice's speech.</li>
        <li>The demonstrators intended to bring attention to allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, which <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a23494884/christine-blasey-ford-sexual-assault-stories/">gained national attention</a> during his Supreme Court confirmation last year.</li>

      <hr/>
      <p>People haven't forgotten the accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh–and they don't want him to forget, either.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, during a dinner hosted by conservative law organization The Federalist Society in Washington D.C., which intended to honor Kavanaugh, protestors from progressive organization Demand Justice assembled to disrupt the event. They played <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a25563112/christine-blasey-ford-presents-sports-illustrated-award/">Dr. Christine Blasey Ford</a>'s testimony on loop on a giant screen directly outside of the venue. Later, as Kavanaugh started his speech, demonstrators disguised in eveningwear shot up from their seats, shouting, "We believe Christine Ford! We believe survivors! You lied under oath!" as they blew on rape whistles.</p>

      <p>Other protestors also dressed up in red handmaid outfits, emulating the disenfranchised female characters that are the centerpiece of Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel, <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, which was later <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a28085816/the-cast-of-the-handmaids-tale-mirrors-our-reality/">made into a Hulu series</a>.</p>

      <p>In an emailed statement to <i>BAZAAR.com</i>, Demand Justice's senior counsel Katie O'Connor explained, "You can claim to respect survivors of sexual assault or you can pay for a celebration of Brett Kavanaugh, but you can’t do both. Any organization that doesn’t want to be complicit in normalizing Kavanaugh should withdraw its support from The Federalist Society and pledge not to give in the future." Facebook had also recently come under fire for reportedly sponsoring last night's event, according to <i><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/14/brett-kavanaughs-keynote-protested-christine-blasey-ford-supporters/4196853002/">USA Today</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Last year, after President Donald Trump (<a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a23791043/trump-supporters-cruel-laughing-men-human-rights/">who has also been accused of sexual assault by multiple women</a> but repeatedly denies the accounts) nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, Dr. Ford came forward to allege that Kavanuagh sexually assaulted her in high school.</p>
      <p>Before Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, another woman emerged with yet another accusation. This time, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez">Deborah Ramirez alleged</a> that the nominee sexually harassed her while they were both students at Yale University.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied both accusations.</p>
