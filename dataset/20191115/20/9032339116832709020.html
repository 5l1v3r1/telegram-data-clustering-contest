      <p>Something new is brewing between Rent the Runway and Nordstrom.</p>
      <p>The two luxury retail giants are planning to expand their partnership later this month, in which Rent the Runway will increase their Drop-Off Box Network from five to 30 Nordstrom locations nationwide, giving members more options for a seamless rental return experience. In addition to that, members will also be able to access exclusive services from Nordstrom, including styling and gift wrapping, both of which come just in time for the busy holiday season.</p>
      <p>This expansion, which will officially arrive by November 18, can be found in cities like Los Angeles, Nashville, Seattle, and Chicago.</p>
      <p>“The expansion of our partnership helps us better serve our customers through innovation around products and experiences," said Jamie Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom.</p>

      <p>Nordstrom will also become a platform partner with Rent the Runway, in which they will contribute inventory to the e-commerce retailer in order to extend the lifecycle of their own collections. Together, the companies will additionally study ways to provide customers with exclusive products that would be available to either rent or purchase.</p>
      <p>“We are thrilled to be expanding our partnership with Nordstrom, the company known and respected for their unparalleled commitment to deliver world-class service and experience," said Rent the Runway CEO and co-founder Jenn Hyman. "We have seen a massive consumer behavior shift unfold over the past several years, with our community now relying on Rent the Runway as a near daily utility. As our business has grown, we’ve seen unparalleled demand for physical experiences including the convenience of Drop-Off Boxes."</p>
