      <h1>9/11 survivors, family members beg government to release terror attacks report</h1>

      <p>A lawyer for 9/11 victims’ families on Friday blasted the Justice Department’s staunch refusal to release a 2016 report detailing everything the government knows about the terror attacks — including the name of an unindicted co-conspirator who remains at large.</p>
      <p>“We believe that every page of these reports should be revealed,” attorney James Kreindler said following a hearing in which prosecutors and lawyers for survivors and victims’ families battled over the document, which is classified.</p>
      <p>“Families are entitled to know all about the Saudi government officials who were accomplices to al Qaeda,” said Kreindler, who represents numerous plaintiffs that filed suit in an <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/03/20/families-of-911-victims-file-suit-against-saudi-arabia/">attempt to hold the country accountable.</a></p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia has staunchly denied any involvement in the attacks, though two of the attackers, Fahad al-Thumairy and Omar al-Bayoumi, have been linked to the kingdom in FBI and Congressional records.</p>
      <p>Part of Friday’s fight also hinged on the identity of a so-called “third man,” known to have given orders to al-Thumairy and al-Bayoumi.</p>
      <p>While his name is known to a select few, survivors and family want it made public.</p>
      <p>“Every family member has a right to know who it was who gave the order 20 months before 9/11 that led to mass murder,” Kreindler said. “And when the government comes out and says nuh uh, we’re not giving you the last final most comprehensive review of 2016, you’re seeing the leopard’s true spots.”</p>
      <p>Survivor Tim Frolich, who escaped the South Tower mere minutes before its collapse, says the hearing left him “nauseated.”</p>
      <p>“Our government, the Department of Justice, just admitted in front of the judge that they have evidence about the third man, and they’re not releasing it,” he said. “How is that transparency? How is that the FBI protecting us? How is that acceptable.”</p>
      <p>“That’s the FBI and the Saudis basically joined at the hip,” Frolich said.</p>
      <p>Assistant US Attorney Sarah Normand Friday said the information was subject to “state secret privilege.”</p>
