      <p>Ade Adepitan apologised for technical difficulties that plagued <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/children-in-need/">Children in Need</a> live on TV.</p>
      <p>The presenter, who is co-hosting the event with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tess-daly/">Tess Daly</a>, issued the apology after a live segment in London went awry.</p>
      <p>Viewers watching from the capital saw the live feed, direct from the Royal Mail sorting office, cut short as the show cut to an advert and then back to the studio.</p>
      <p>Many were upset that a child playing the violin live on the segment was cut away from and his time in the spotlight ruined.</p>
      <p>‘We are experiencing technical problems in London,’ Ade confirmed. ‘So apologies for that.’</p>
      <p>He then quipped: ‘Probably some wet leaves in the wi-fi or something.’</p>
      <p>Every single Tube user just had a shiver down their spine. Don’t mention wet leaves!</p>

      <p>Fans watching the show live from home certainly had some thoughts about the on-air problems.</p>

      <p>‘My heart is breaking for that poor kid about to play the violin,’ one fan wrote. ‘They cut away just as he started playing!’</p>
      <p>Another suggested: ‘Ask the kid to play violin live on TV and then cut him off. Poor form.’</p>
      <p>‘Did they just cut that little kid playing the violin?’ a viewer asked. ‘There might have been technical difficulties but I feel so bad.’</p>

      <p>Violin Boy may just end up being the star of the night – and fans are asking for justice for him too.</p>
      <p>‘Bring back violin boy,’ one fan called. ‘The few notes he played before he got to play sounded brilliant.’</p>

      <p>The annual charity show is aiming to raise money tonight for disadvantaged children up and down the UK.</p>
      <p>The charity will be hoping, as ever, to break their own record for the most donations raised in a single broadcast.</p>
