      <h1>Here’s What Myles Garrett Told His Teammates After Last Night’s Brawl</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:01:52+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>During the closing seconds of Thursday night’s showdown between the Browns and Steelers, former No. 1 pick Myles Garrett struck Mason Rudolph over the head with his own helmet. It’s a moment that will unfortunately be remembered for years to come.</p>
      <p>Garrett and Rudolph were tangled up on the field before they exchanged blows. The officiating crew had to eject Garrett for his actions, which didn’t surprise anyone at FirstEnergy Stadium.</p>
      <p>League executives wasted little time dishing out consequences to those involved in the brawl.</p>
      <p>The NFL suspended Garrett indefinitely – for at least the rest of the 2019 season, including the playoffs.</p>
      <p>Although Garrett’s actions last night may change his reputation forever, the superstar defensive end made sure to address his team about the situation.</p>
      <p>Joel Bitonio told the media that Garrett spoke to the team on Friday.</p>
      <p>Garrett reportedly said he’s going to strive to be a better person and feels as if he let the team down.</p>

      <p>Addressing your teammates after an incident of this magnitude is definitely the right move here. Even if opponents no longer respect Garrett for what he did, it’s important that his teammates support him.</p>
      <p>There are reports circulating that Garrett plans to appeal the NFL’s suspension – albeit it’s tough to envision his punishment getting reduced.</p>
      <p>As of right now, the Browns most likely won’t have Garrett on the field until next season.</p>
