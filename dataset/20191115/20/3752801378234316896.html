      <p>Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi has voiced hope that the Ebola epidemic in his country would be stamped out by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>"We believe that by the end of the year we will have eradicated the disease entirely," Tshisekedi said during a visit to Berlin.</p>
      <p>The epidemic began in August 2018 in North Kivu province before spreading to neighbouring Ituri and South Kivu -- a remote and largely lawless region bordering Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.</p>
      <p>It has killed more than 2 000 people to date and is the second Ebola outbreak deadliest on record after an outbreak that struck West Africa in 2014-16, claiming more than 11 300 lives.</p>
      <p>DRC officials have introduced two vaccines to fight the epidemic.</p>
      <p>The Ebola virus is passed on by contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected or recently deceased person.</p>
      <p>Following an incubation period of up to three weeks, a high fever develops, along with weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.</p>
      <p>This is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.</p>
      <p>The death rate is typically high, ranging up to 90% in some outbreaks, according to the WHO.</p>
      <p>The virus's natural reservoir is suspected to be a tropical bat which does not itself fall ill but can pass on the microbe to humans who hunt it for food.</p>
