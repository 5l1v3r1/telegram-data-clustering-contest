      <p>BuyDig has <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discounted</a> the 55-inch LG B9 OLED TV, bringing it down to just $1196, and you still get a year of Disney+ for free.</p>
      <p>So you're saving $400 off of this TV, then getting a year of Disney+ for free (which is a $69 value). This is definitely the TV deal to get this holiday season.</p>
      <p>The LG B9 is a 2019 OLED TV model, so it is the latest and greatest from the company. It comes in 55 and 65-inch models – both of which are discounted right now.</p>

      <p>The B9 is the lower-end OLED TV model, but it still offers a really great picture. That's because it's OLED, duh. It is going to produce brighter colors and darker blacks. It also supports Dolby Vision, giving you a really great picture no matter what you're watching.</p>
      <p>On the audio side, there are speakers built-in and they do support Dolby Atmos. So you will get some really great audio out of this TV, and you likely won't even need to hook up a sound bar. That's a great thing.</p>
      <p>Now inside the B9, you're going to find webOS running the show. This is LG's proprietary TV operating system. It has all of the big apps that you'd expect. Including Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube and even the new Disney+ – hence this promotion.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>LG also has support for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant on-board. So no matter which assistant you'd rather use, you'll be covered with this one. Allowing you to control your TV using your voice, as well as controlling your smart home products around you.</p>
