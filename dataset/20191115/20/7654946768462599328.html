      <p>A Manhattan jury Friday convicted all three defendants in the deadly 2015 gas explosion that killed two people and leveled three East Village buildings.</p>
      <p>After two days of deliberations, the jury convicted landlord Maria Hrynenko, contractor Dilber Kukic and unlicensed plumber Athanasios “Jerry” Ioannidis of manslaughter, assault, reckless endangerment and other charges.</p>
      <p>The three <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/02/11/5-arrested-in-fatal-east-village-building-explosion/">illegally diverted gas</a> from 119 Second Ave. to 121 Second Ave., between East Seventh Street and St. Marks Place — both buildings owned by Hrynenko, prosecutors told jurors.</p>
      <p>Escaping gas from the cheap, faulty hook-up <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/02/11/5-arrested-in-fatal-east-village-building-explosion/">ignited in a fireball</a> that claimed the lives of restaurantgoer Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and restaurant worker Moises Lucon, 26. The blast also injured two dozen others, among them Kukic and the landlord’s son, Michael Hryenko Jr.</p>
      <p>Relatives of the defendants and of the two victims were in court, and many broke into tears at the verdict.</p>
      <p>“They have to pay,” Figueroa’s mom, Ana, said sadly after the verdict. “Maria’s daughters were crying — and as a mother I feel for her, I do feel for her, and it’s hard — but it’s the truth.”</p>
