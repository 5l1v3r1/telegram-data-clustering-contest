      <h4>Two awesome vehicles helping to raise money for military veterans and their families.</h4>

      <p>On Friday, November 22nd, the 1950 Chevrolet 3100 Restomod will cross the auction block, and 100 percent of this truck's sales price will go to the <a href="https://www.greenberetfoundation.org/?utm_source=motorious.com&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=motorious">Green Beret Foundation</a>. This restomod pickup truck combines the Chevy's vintage with a lowered stance, custom paint job and, of course, a 5.3-liter LS3 V8 under the hood. The gorgeous glossy patina paint job features pure copper ship rivets, and this truck was built for cruising with an automatic transmission, air conditioning and disc brakes.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 23rd, the 1995 Ford Mustang GT will be auctioned off with a portion of the proceeds going to the <a href="https://www.pinupsforvets.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=motorious">Pin-Ups For Vets</a>; in addition to a portion of this car's sales price, Republic Auctions says that it will also donate a portion of its profits from the upcoming auction event to this charity. This Mustang wears a Saleen S351 body kit and Mustang Cobra wheels, but it still packs the factory 5.0-liter V8 under the hood.</p>
      <p>The Green Beret Foundation is an organization designed to help Army Special Forces transition back from combat and into the civilian world as well as caring for the families of those lost in combat. Pin-Ups For Vets raises funds to improve the lives of military veterans including making donations to VA hospitals, supporting homeless veterans and boosting the morale of veterans and their spouses.</p>
