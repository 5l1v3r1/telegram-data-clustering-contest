      <p>In partnership with Art Circle Gallery, the show, entitled “Patikim! The Art of Filipino Hospitality,” opens on Dec. 9 and will run until Dec. 19, from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the Art Gallery in SM Megamall Building A, Mandaluyong City. </p>
      <p>The exhibit continues the legacy of Teresita “Mama Sita” Reyes, a lifelong advocate of the culinary heritage of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Participating artists were tasked to express this proud heritage by channeling the fecundity of the Philippine land and seas, as well as the creativity of its kitchens and dining tables.</p>
      <p>Proceeds from the fundraising event will go to a scholarship program for deserving aspiring chefs who will be awarded free tuition to the Filipino Cuisine classes by Chef Cecilia de Castro at the Academy of Culinary Education. </p>
      <p>Guests will enjoy food samplings and refreshments during the opening on Dec. 9. </p>
