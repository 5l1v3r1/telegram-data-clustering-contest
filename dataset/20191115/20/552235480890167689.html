      <p>A taxi driver who claims Scots snooker ace <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/snookers-john-higgins-hurls-abuse-20884240">John Higgins bolted without paying his £5 fare</a> has vowed to go to the police unless the money is paid. <br/><br/>It comes after a man, claiming to be<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/stewartry-snooker-players-stunned-john-12736365"> the four-time world champion’s</a> manager, spoke to the Daily Record and launched a blistering attack on cabbie James Crawford branding him a “desperate and bitter man”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/snookers-john-higgins-hurls-abuse-20884240">We told</a> today  how Higgins fell asleep in the back of the taxi on the way to his hotel in Belfast after a boozy night out on Tuesday. <br/><br/>James, 57, said Higgins woke up and ran from his taxi without paying when they finished the short journey. <br/><br/>Today, we called Higgins’ so-called manager after sourcing the number from calls made to James’ phone after the taxi incident.</p>

      <p>The man, who refused to give his name, said: “There is no truth in this. These are just the claims of a desperate taxi driver and a bitter man.”</p>
      <p>The individual also said he was in the taxi with Higgins and paid the fare himself.</p>
      <p>He went on to accuse James of lying in a bid to make money from blackening Higgins’ name and also branded him a “bigot”.</p>
      <p>He said: “That driver just wants to make money from this made up story - and this is really about religion.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows John is a Celtic fan and this taxi driver is just a bigot.”</p>

      <p>Higgins, 44, is one of the most successful snooker players in the history of the sport.</p>
      <p>Since turning professional in 1992, he has won 30 ranking titles, including four World Championships and three UK Championships, as well as two Masters titles.</p>
      <p>Now James has hit back at the man who calls himself Higgins’ manager and is standing by his claims of the pro-player’s drunken fare-dodging.</p>
      <p>James said: “If he’s accusing me of lying then I’ll take this to the police and we’ll settle it in court.</p>
      <p>“I have a witness and I can get my solicitor request CCTV from outside the hotel. If they want to go down that road, I’ll fight it.</p>

      <p>James also rubbished claims that he's a bigot as 'ridiculous'.</p>
      <p>He said: "I know John Higgins as a snooker player. I wouldn't know what team he supports or his religion and he wouldn't know those things about me."</p>
      <p>The manager also denies James' claim that he requested a meeting with him on Thursday night to 'sort him out' with the money over the unpaid taxi fare.,</p>
      <p>The manager said: "That's absolute nonsense. I didn't call him and I don't know how he got my number. But you people can believe what you want."</p>
      <p>The Daily Record have seen a call log on James' phone which lists calls from the same number we contacted the individual on.</p>
      <p>We have also been unable to reach John Higgins directly and the person we spoke to said he does not wish to comment on our story.</p>
