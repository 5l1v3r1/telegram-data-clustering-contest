      <h1>Win or lose at BKFC 9, Artem Lobov wants rematch with Paulie Malignaggi in a boxing ring</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:41:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author">Steven Muehlhausen</a></address>
      <p>After nearly two years of near-riots andexpletive-laden tirades,the most heavily hyped fightin the history of Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship took place at BKFC 6whenArtem Lobov defeated Paulie Malignaggi by unanimous decision.</p>
      <p>All the animosity that had existed between one of Conor McGregor's main sparring partners and the former two-division boxing champion looked to be put to be rest. While on the surface, Lobov and Malignaggi appeared to go in different directions after the fight,that hasn't necessarily beenthe case for Lobov. The ex-UFC fighter is interested in settling the score once and for all with Malignaggi's and is looking to prove that he can beat him at his own game.</p>
      <p>"I walked out with a lot of cash, and I won," Lobov boastfully told Sporting News about winning the fight. "He got his ass whooped. It felt pretty good to beat him up. But he’s still talking trash, so I would be happy to rematch him in the boxing ring if he wants. I know he thinks boxing is his game, but it’s my game now. He can come into my world."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/boxing/news/paulie-malignaggi-artem-lobov-bare-knuckle-fight-payback-against-conor-mcgregor/1x6k3twmmq1mq1fivgusi07yvi">Malignaggi disparaged Lobov</a> at every turn in the buildup. The current Showtime boxing analyst talked in the lead-up of how facing the former UFC journeyman would be a walk in the park. He also promised to putLobov in a “f—g coma,” along with proclaiming that he woulddisparage his lifeless body with bodily fluidsafter knocking him out. The fact Lobov was able to make Malignaggi eat his words made it the biggest win of his nine-year combat sports career.</p>
      <p>"It was incredible," Lobov said. "I can say that was the most satisfying win of my whole career. It just felt good. It was like, ‘Take that mother----er.’"</p>
      <p>With Malignaggi now in his rearview mirror, Lobov now turns his attention to a familiar foe when he meets Jason Knight in the main event of Saturday's Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship 9. Back in April, Lobov and Knight battled in one of the most bloody, violent affairs in recent memory with Lobov earning the unanimous decision win.</p>
      <p>Even though he emerged victorious on that evening, Lobov is excited to be sharing the ring with Knight again because he loves to fight, and putting his fist to someone's face is the "most peaceful placeon the planet."When looking back at the first meeting, Lobov found deficiencies in his performance. This time around, the "Russian Hammer"made sure he left no stone unturned, and you will see a completely different person than people saw seven months ago.</p>
      <p>"Number one, preparing for the first fight, I was doing it blindfolded," Lobov said."I didn’t know what to expect because I had never tried it before. I couldn’t train properly because I didn’t know anyone who did bare-knuckle. So my preparation was a little wrong in terms of my cardio work in getting ready for the two-minute rounds. What I was doing was incorrect. I was preparing for a marathon, and the fight was a sprint. I had it all wrong. This time around, I completely changed my preparation. Being able to train nothing but boxing for a full year made me a much better boxer as I brought in professional boxers helped me make a lot of gains. I look forward to showing the world what I’ve been working on."</p>
      <p>Lobov entered the world of bare-knuckle fighting on a three-fight losing streak and an overall MMA record of 13-15-1 with one no-contest. Since coming to BKFC in 2019, Lobov is 2-0. A win on Saturday night would put the icing on the cake for the 34-year-old.</p>
      <p>"With a win on Saturday, this will certainly be the best year of my career in terms of financially and the wins, whichever way you want to look at it," Lobov said.</p>
