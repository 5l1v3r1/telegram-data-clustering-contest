      <p>The terminology surrounding self-driving technologies and advanced driving aids has started to earn quite a bit of criticism in the wake of <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2018/01/idiots-need-understand-self-driving-cars-arent-yet/">publicized crashes</a> and growing outcry from consumer advocacy groups. For years, the industry has treated all assistance technologies as equal — placing everything on a sliding scale developed by SAE International.</p>
      <p>It’s actually a good metric if you’re familiar with <a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles">SAE’s autonomous ranking system</a>. But to a layperson the differences between SAE Level 2 and 5 don’t mean a whole lot, despite offering <i>completely</i> different experiences. Automakers also have terms of their own, some of which could easily lead customers to believe their products are far more capable than reality allows.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.autonews.com/blogs/call-clarity-self-driving-terminology"><i>Automotive News</i></a> recently published an op-ed calling for clarity, and it was so good, we felt inclined to share. </p>
      <p>From <i>Automotive News</i>:</p>
      <blockquote><i>Automation</i>, for example, describes the presence of automatic equipment that’s used as one part in an overall process. <i>Autonomy</i>, on the other hand, confers the idea that a system is governing itself and all actions. <i>Self-driving </i>implies that a vehicle is being driven without a human involved, while <i>driverless</i> might indicate no one or nothing is in control at all.<br/>Those terms are just the start. Add the likes of <i>semi-autonomous</i>, <i>partially self-driving</i> and <i>driver-assist feature, </i>and the language landscape becomes more cluttered. Throw in industry jargon such as “<i>Level 2 Plus</i>” and Elon Musk’s special dictionary entries for “<i>Autopilot</i>,” “<i>feature complete</i>” and “<i>fully self driving,</i>” and this confounding mix is complete.</blockquote>
      <p>Tesla has  been repeatedly called out for its misleading Autopilot marketing. While the name seems to indicate the car is capable of driving itself, and its CEO <i>has</i> claimed all Autopilot-equipped vehicles have the necessary hardware for the task, it’s not supposed to manifest until the company issues a TBA software push. And yet this hasn’t stopped drivers from taking their hands off the wheel in an act of woeful overconfidence — sometimes resulting in tragic accidents. Tesla has since been careful to remind everyone to remain in full control of the vehicle at all times, but it’s advice that’s rarely heeded.</p>
      <p>Your author was recently watching an episode of <i>Fastest Car</i> on Netflix in which a well-known Tesla drag racer from YouTube took his hands off the wheels and briefly praised the Model S P100D’s self-driving ability on camera. He later took third — satisfyingly beaten by a heavily modified 1989 Ford Mustang and more-streetable 1990 Nissan 300ZX.</p>
      <p>Tesla is not the only company that engages in this sort of wordplay, however. Several manufacturers offering advanced driving aids use euphemisms for their technological suites. <i>Automotive News’</i> Pete Bigelow suggests this is irresponsible and dangerous — potentially contributing to several fatal accidents over the past few years. He also expressed concerns that SAE’s ranking system, while fine for industry insiders, is a terrible tool for educating the general public. The same went for the NHTSA’s “highly automated vehicle” grouping of SAE Levels 3, 4 and 5.</p>
      <p>Bigelow suggests adopting terms proposed by Waymo CEO John Krafcik: “If every time someone talked about a ‘Level 2 system,’ they just said, ‘driver-assist system,’ then it’d be so much easier,” he said. “Maybe the definitional framework is wrong. … If you need a driver’s license, then you shouldn’t call it fully self-driving. If you need a driver’s license, call it a driver-assist.”</p>
      <p>Go ahead and keep the SAE designations for the industry, but consumers need a streamlined version if they’re ever going to have a clear understanding of what’s actually being offered. Yes, catchy names are part of doing business, but anything that could be construed as misleading (intentionally or not) really isn’t going to do automakers any favors in the long run. Consumers have already started to wise up to <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/10/apple-co-founder-claims-autonomous-cars-arent-happening/">the limitations of present-day technologies</a>. Calling something self-driving when it isn’t won’t stand forever.</p>
      <p>The best thing automakers can do is try and get ahead of it before people start getting outraged and begin making a big stink about it. It doesn’t take much effort to start a social media campaign, and we’ve certainly seen angry people out for blood over far less.</p>
