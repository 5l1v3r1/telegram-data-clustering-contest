      <h1>£8m McDonald's, Greggs and Coffee Coffee development approved for site off the A52</h1>
      <h2>"It's just a lost game," one campaigner said</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:27:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:27</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>Controversial £8m plans for a McDonald's, a Costa Coffee and a Greggs in a village off the A52 have been given the go-ahead.</p>
      <p>Eight Rushcliffe borough councillors voted in favour of the plans for a site next to Wheatcroft Island, on land <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/new-mcdonalds-costa-coffee-could-3072869">between the A52 and Landmere Lane</a>, Edwalton. Two councillors voted against.</p>
      <p>Among objectors to the scheme was Hetvi Parekh, 36, a civil servant and a member of the Edwalton Community Group, who said she was 'disappointed' with the outcome.</p>
      <p>"It's just a lost game. We're all very disappointed, I would say. We're not happy about it," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's not just about the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/traffic-travel">traffic</a>. We are also worried that the employment that it's going to create, it's not going to be high-end employment, it's all low wages."</p>
      <p>McDonald's bosses say the new fast-food outlet is <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/mcdonalds-could-open-a52-next-3530837">likely to open next summer</a>.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the <a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/all-about/east-midlands">company</a> said: "We’re excited to be opening a new restaurant in Edwalton following the decision of the planning committee last night.</p>
      <p>"We aim to start building works as soon as possible and look to open sometime in 2020.</p>
      <p>“As well as offering great-tasting food for our customers, the new restaurant will create at least 65 full- and part-time jobs for local people and we look forward to playing a positive role in the local community.”</p>

      <p>A Costa Coffee spokeswoman said: “As the UK’s favourite coffee shop brand, we work closely with local planning departments when opening new drive-thru stores to ensure we comply with all building and planning requirements.</p>
      <p>"We can confirm that planning permission has been approved for the drive-thru store on Landmere Lane, Edwalton, Nottinghamshire, and we look forward to sharing more information soon.”</p>
      <p>The borough council's planning committee, meeting on Thursday, November 14, approved West Bridgford-based Henry Davidson Developments' proposals for two drive-through outlets - to be occupied by McDonald's and Costa - along with a day nursery and three shop units, one of which will be occupied by Greggs.</p>
      <p>Members considered a report detailing objections from 136 members of the public, on grounds such as traffic congestion, light pollution and likely litter and anti-social behaviour. Four members of the public backed the plans.</p>
      <p>Speaking previously, Graeme Cosgrove, director of Henry Davidson Developments, said the project had been reviewed by Highways England and Nottinghamshire County Council.</p>
      <p>"They are both happy that the road network has a substantial amount of available capacity for additional traffic," he said.</p>
      <p>The scheme is located on land between an Aldi and care home, which already have <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">planning permission</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, elsewhere a retail park expected to deliver a new gym, Lidl supermarket and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/accident-waiting-happen-developers-bid-3487926">Starbucks coffee shop is planned in West Bridgford</a>.</p>
