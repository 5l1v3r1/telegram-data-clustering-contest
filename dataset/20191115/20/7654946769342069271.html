      <h1>Doctors and nurses are the real heroes in latest Nike drop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:17:10+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Sparks</a></address>
      <p>This sneaker drop is designed for the real all-stars out there — doctors, nurses and other medical workers.</p>
      <p>Nike has released a new line of shoes <a href="https://news.nike.com/news/nike-air-zoom-pulse">they’re called the Air Zoom Pulse,</a> a shoe for “everyday heroes,” the company said in a release announcing the news.</p>
      <p>The shoes went for a test run at OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, Ore., where Nike designers studied the hospital staffers’ work. They found that nurses, for example, “walk approximately 4 to 5 miles and sit for less than an hour” during their 12-hour workday. Take that, Steph Curry.</p>
      <p>With the comfort and durability of the conventional clog in mind, the creators say the Pulse is supportive, lace-less, easy to clean and has plenty of traction for the sometimes slippery conditions in the medical setting.</p>
      <p>“The fit, cushioning and traction systems work together to secure the foot in all hospital conditions,” the company added.</p>
      <p>For the last 16 years, the sneaker giant has <a href="https://www.onwardohsu.org/freestyle">partnered with OHSU</a> for the annual Doernbecher Freestyle Program, which invites six young artists and designers aged 8 to 15, who are patients at the hospital, to design shoes and apparel for Nike.</p>
      <p>This year, these six creators have contributed their talents to the Air Zoom Pulse, which releases on Dec. 7. All profits from the sale of these styles will be donated to Doernbecher Children’s Hospital.</p>
