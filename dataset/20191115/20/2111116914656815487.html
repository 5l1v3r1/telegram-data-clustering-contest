      <p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing/pc/10-of-the-best-desktop-pcs-of-2015-1304391">Computers</a> find more uses every single day, and that means you'll have a ton of applications in use at any time. This is true whether you're at work or play. </p>
      <p>No matter if you're writing, doing graphic design work, coding or working as a call center assistant, having a secondary monitor can let your desktop have some breathing room, spreading apps out in a more natural way. </p>
      <p>Now, getting an extra <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/peripherals/best-monitor-9-reviewed-and-rated-1058662">monitor</a> is easy if you're sitting at home or in an office, but what about when you're trying to get work done in your local coffee shop? Well, monitor manufacturers far and wide have responded to the demand, putting out thin and light models that are just as good as their full-sized brethren. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-sidecar-in-macos-catalina">Apple even lets you use an iPad as a portable monitor</a> these days. </p>
      <p>So, ahead of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a>, we went ahead and picked out the best portable monitors on the market right now, all using the latest display technology. And, because we've included our exclusive price comparison tool, you can find the best deal quick, because we know it's a busy world out there. </p>
      <h4>1. Packed Pixels</h4>
      <p>Retina wingmirrors for your laptop</p>
      <p><b>Pixel-resolution: </b>2,048 x 1,536</p>
      <aside>Check AmazonCheck Walmart<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Packed%20Pixels%20Packed%20Pixels">See all prices (2 found)</a></aside>
      <p>+ Highly portable<br/>+ 'Retina' resolution<br/>+ Completely lag-free<br/>- Text is tiny at higher resolutions<br/>- No USB-C option</p>
      <p>Packed Pixels is a wingmirror-style monitor that can be fixed to the left and right sides of your laptop’s screen to give you two extra displays. While they can be used at their native 2,048 x 1,536 resolution for maximum screen real-estate, these 9.7-inch panels are best used in ‘Retina’ mode and with a single app maximised to fill the space in each.</p>
      <p>Essentially, it’s like bolting an iPad Air 2 onto your laptop, and any app that you drag onto it – from Atom to Microsoft Word and Google Docs, Slack and Skype (you get the idea) – is rendered in crisp detail.</p>
      <p>Because Packed Pixels uses DisplayPort (for video - USB-C also works using a converter) and a USB connection (for power), it’s completely free of any noticeable lag and serves up a buttery smooth experience. Slim, light, bright and supremely portable, it also comes with a soft carrying case for transportation.</p>

      <p>+ Thin and light<br/>+ Excellent image quality<br/>- Expensive<br/>- Low brightness</p>
      <p>The Asus ZenScreen MB16A Portable Monitor is one of the nicest-looking USB monitors we’ve seen, and it comes with a number of features and design considerations that make it an incredibly handy device, and one of the best portable monitors of 2019. However, it comes at a price, with the ZenScreen proving to be more expensive than many of the other portable monitors on this list. However, the build and image quality of this screen makes it well worth the extra money. Fans of Asus' ZenBook laptops should be particularly interested in this device, as it has a design that compliments Asus' high-end laptops nicely.</p>

      <h4>3. Asus MB169C+</h4>
      <p>The first USB-C portable monitor impresses</p>
      <p><b>Pixel-resolution: </b>1,920 x 1,080</p>
      <aside>$290.42 View at Amazon$317.23View at AmazonCheck Walmart<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Asus%20MB169C%2B">See all prices (4 found)</a></aside>
      <p>+ Thin and light<br/>+ Good viewing angles and picture<br/>+ Uses single USB-C<br/>- Slightly too dim<br/>- Fiddly menu control wheel</p>
      <p>The Asus <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/mb169c">MB169C+</a> isn’t quite as portable as Packed Pixels, but its 15.6-inch size makes using it feel more like using a regular monitor. It has a healthy pixel-resolution of 1,920 x 1,080, which is perfect for streaming full HD video, working with two applications side-by-side and even gaming if you have a sufficiently powerful laptop.</p>
      <p>The MB169C+ is incredibly simple to use thanks to its USB-C connection, which uses a single cable to transmit video, sound and power. It also comes in a handy protective sleeve that doubles up as a carrying case. Asus’ portable monitor uses an in-plane switching (IPS) display, which brings decent viewing angles making it perfect for watching video with a friend.</p>

      <p>+ Great picture<br/>+ Mounts to cameras/tripods<br/>+ Well-connected<br/>- Bland design</p>
      <p>Aimed at photographers who need a monitor to take on shoots, the Gechic 1101P features an IPS display like the Asus MB169C+. However, this one is smaller at 11.6 inches and more portable, allowing to be easily attached to a tripod or SLR camera while out in the field.</p>
      <p>This full HD display supports 16.7 million colors which can easily be tweaked using the monitor’s onboard color temperature settings, allowing you to get it as close to your camera’s display as possible</p>
      <p>The 1101P is also well-connected, featuring support for VGA, micro HDMI and mini DisplayPort. These make it suitable for a number of different use cases – from previewing photos and videos shot on a camera to being used as a normal portable monitor with your laptop.</p>

      <h4>5. Asus MB168B+</h4>
      <p>1080p goodness over regular USB-A</p>
      <p><b>Pixel-resolution: </b>1,920 x 1,080</p>
      <aside>$121.57 View at Walmart$121.57View at Amazon$134.99View at Adorama<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Asus%20MB168B%2B">See all prices (7 found)</a>311 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆</aside>
      <p>+ Thin and light<br/>+ Good viewing angles and picture<br/>+ Can hook up several of them<br/>- Needs USB 3.0 for full benefit</p>
      <p>If you like the sound of the Asus MB169C+ but don’t have a laptop with a USB-C connection, then the Asus MB169B+ is what you need.</p>
      <p>This one also connects to your laptop with a single cable, except it uses a regular USB-A port instead. It works with both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, though you’ll experience noticeably more latency with the former due to its slower data transfer rate.</p>
      <p>Still, it features the same alluring slim and lightweight design. Thanks to Asus EzLink tech, which offloads the graphics processing from the PC to dedicated hardware in the monitor, you can even hook up five of them if your laptop has enough USB ports.</p>

      <h4>6. AOC E1759FWU</h4>
      <p>A bigger portable monitor for streaming video</p>
      <p><b>Pixel-resolution: </b>1,600 x 900</p>
      <aside>Check AmazonCheck Walmart<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=AOC%20E1759FWU">See all prices (2 found)</a>136 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆</aside>
      <p>+ Large screen size<br/>+ Built-in kickstand<br/>+ Affordable<br/>- Not full HD<br/>- Average viewing angles</p>
      <p>This portable monitor from AOC isn’t going to beat either of the Asus models on our list due to its comparatively lower pixel-resolution of 1,600 x 900.</p>
      <p>However, its lower resolution means that it’s going to be less taxing on your laptop’s battery life. Taking that into account, and the fact that it’s the largest portable monitor on our list at 17.3 inches, and the E1759Fwu suddenly becomes an interesting option if you’re into streaming video on the move.</p>
      <p>And, because it’s a few years old, you’ll pick it up for much less than competing portable monitors. With its thin and light dimensions and glossy black frame, it doesn’t exactly look archaic – it just isn’t as multi-talented as newer and flashier alternatives.</p>
