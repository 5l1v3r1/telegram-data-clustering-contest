      <h1>Business group seeks faster power auctions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:15:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">Manila Standard Business</a></address>
      <p>The Federation of Philippine Industries called on the Department of Energy and other industry players and stakeholders to speed up the next round of biddings for the much-needed greenfield base load capacity. </p>
      <p>The group said the successful power supply agreements (PSA) two months ago that will deliver 1,200 megawtss and 500 MW of capacity effective December 26, 2019, should be followed as soon as possible by another round of Competitive Selection Process bidding.</p>
      <p>The FPI also requested DOE and the Energy Regulatory Commission to urgently approve the current PSAs to prepare their implementation and effectivity.</p>
      <p>FPI chairman Jesus Arranza lauded the signing of the additional contract capacity but questioned the long timeline for the PSA approval process.</p>
      <p>“FPI welcomes the news of this much-needed additional power, to meet the growing demand of our country. We just wish the government and regulator would act swifter on the PSA approvals,” he said.</p>
