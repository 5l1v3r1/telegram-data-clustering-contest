      <h1>Feige, Ruffalo Are Going to Talk About Hulk’s MCU Future</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4/">Avengers: Endgame</a> star Mark Ruffalo -- who has played Bruce Banner/Hulk in the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe/">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> since 2012 -- says he and Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige are going to talk about what the future may hold for the character.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC3ESY3cyRo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=347">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a>, the actor was asked if audiences can expect to see the Hulk on their screens again.</p>

      <p>"I don't know," he said. "I don't know. I do know that I did give Kevin Feige the Blockbuster Award at the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/marvel-vs-scorsese-feud-takes-over-the-hollywood-film-awards/">Hollywood Film Awards</a> the other day, to a smattering of applause. And he did say, 'Hey, do you think there's any more story left here?' And I said, 'I could probably come up with a few storylines.' And he said, 'Maybe you should come in and we'll have a talk.' You heard it here."</p>
      <p>Ruffalo has played Hulk in the MCU since 2012's <i>The Avengers</i>, replacing Edward Norton, who played the character in <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>. Ruffalo has subsequently reprised his role in <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>Endgame </i>(plus uncredited cameos in <i>Iron Man 3</i> and <i>Captain Marvel</i>.)</p>

      <p>While Hulk's cinematic future is up in the air following the events of <i>Endgame</i>, Marvel Studios is <a href="https://www.cbr.com/she-hulk-disney-plus-new-series/">currently developing</a> a <i>She-Hulk</i> series for the Disney+ streaming service, which recently <a href="https://www.cbr.com/marvels-she-hulk-disney-series-lands-rick-and-morty-writer/">found its head writer</a> in <i>Rick and Morty</i>'s Jessica Gao.</p>
      <p>She-Hulk is the superhero identity of Jennifer Walters, Bruce Banner's cousin. And while Bruce plays a key part in She-Hulk's origin in the comics, it is unclear if Ruffalo will reprise his role for the television show -- as no casting information has been revealed as of yet. It is also unclear what exactly Ruffalo's ideas for new Hulk storylines are, and how they may inform what Marvel does with his character next. In turn, fans of the Enormous Green Rage Monster will simply have to wait for some sort of official announcement from Marvel Studios regarding his post-<i>Endgame</i> role (provided Ruffalo doesn't <a href="https://www.cbr.com/mark-ruffalo-spoiled-infinity-war-2017/">accidentally spill the beans</a> ahead of time).</p>
