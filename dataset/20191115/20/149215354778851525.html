      <p>Whatever you do, don't compare President Trump to "Jeb exclamation point," apparently.</p>
      <p>Conservative commentator Ann Coulter in <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?466331-4/washington-journal-ann-coulter-discusses-impeachment-campaign-2020&amp;start=1131">a C-SPAN interview Friday</a> revealed details about a so-called "screaming match" she had with Trump in the Oval Office in early 2017, during which she says the president freaked out when she pushed the exact wrong buttons.</p>
      <p>"The one moment he got most upset was when I said, 'You're no different from Jeb exclamation point,'" Coulter said. "Then he just lost it."</p>
      <p>Coulter, who correctly remembered not to leave the very important "exclamation point" off of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's name, was cutting deep with that comment given Trump's long, probably unhealthy hatred of his 2016 Republican primary competitor, who earlier this year <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/politics/jeb-bush-trump-2020-cnntv/index.html">recommended</a> a Republican challenge Trump in 2020.</p>
      <p>Since that Oval Office meeting, during which Coulter says she criticized Trump for not keeping campaign promises, the conservative commentator has only soured on the president even more. She <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/1194330911321579524">recently tweeted at Trump</a> that he "must go" and earlier this year blasting him following his national emergency declaration, <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/824063/ann-coulter-says-only-national-emergency-that-president-idiot">saying</a>, "The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot."
