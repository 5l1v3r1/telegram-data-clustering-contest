          <b>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/titans-tv/">Titans</a> Season 2 episode "E.L._.O.," streaming now on DC Universe.</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>A long-time fan theory may have been proven true in the latest episode of DC Universe's <i>Titans. </i>In "E.L._.O.," Rose Wilson (Chelsea Zhang) and Jason Todd (Curran Walters) are on a crime-fighting spree in Gotham, which turns into a heartfelt vacation for the two lovebirds. However, towards the ends of the episode, Rose reveals a dark secret that she's been keeping from the team, one that could tease the adaptation of a classic DC Comics story.</p>
      <p>When the audience first met Rose in the second episode of Season 2, she was on the run from her father, Slade Wilson (Esai Morales), otherwise known as Deathstroke. Dick Grayson (Brenton Thwaites) and the rest of the team see her on TV leading the San Francisco police on a wild chase that lands several cops in the hospital. Once Dick finds Rose passed out in an alley, he offers to bring her in and train her alongside the other Titans.</p>

      <p>At first glance, many fans believed that Rose could be infiltrating the Titans for her father, who has a vendetta against the team, as revealed in the first episode of the season, "Trigon." That theory was shot down, at least at the time, with it being apparent that Rose and Slade never saw eye-to-eye. However, the rug was pulled out from under the <i>Titans</i> audience this week when Rose calls her father informing him that their deal is over, seemingly revealing that she was a mole from the start.</p>
      <p>For those avid DC Comics readers, this story should sound eerily familiar as it borrows major elements from "The Judas Contract." This classic story by George Pérez and Marv Wolfman features Deathstroke taking on a contract to kill the Titans to fulfill a job his son couldn't complete. Using a brainwashed girl named Terra, Slade infiltrates the team to destroy them from the inside. As what's arguably the Titans' most famous comic book saga, "The Judas Contract" ends with Robin adopting the identity of Nightwing and Wally West giving up his Kid Flash persona and quitting the Titans.</p>

      <p>To add insult to secretive injury, Rose may not be the only spy the team has to deal with when it's all said and done. In this week's episode, it also comes to light that Cadmus Labs is conducting experiments on Gar (Ryan Potter), learning information about the Titans using a simulation. If Gar and Conner (Joshua Orpin) can escape the lab before the finale, the duo could potentially be sleeper agents for the evil organization. With only one episode left before the finale, the Titans have a lot on their plate.</p>
