      <h1>At the Big Apple Circus, these clever kitties rule the ring</h1>

      <p>Delicately picking her way along an upturned ladder, Asia the Siamese has a look of haughty disdain on her face, as if she finds the stunt a bit beneath her.</p>
      <p>Disdainful or not, the fabulous feline is one of the star performers with the Savitsky Cats, now taking <a href="https://bigapplecircus.com/">the Big Apple Circus </a>by purrfect storm with their crowd-pleasing turns under the big top.</p>
      <p>Whether they’re rolling barrels, riding brooms, somersaulting, walking on their hind legs and even leapfrogging over each other — all while decked out in natty, red bow ties – these rescue pussycats always bring down the tent. As anyone who’s had a cat can tell you (and I’m one of them), the notion of these creatures doing something — anything! — on command is hilarious.</p>

      <p>But that’s what Svitlana Savitsky, 46, and her daughter, Maryna, have accomplished with their act. Little wonder it attracted the attention of TV’s <a href="https://www.nbc.com/americas-got-talent/video/the-savitsky-cats-quarter-finals/3781440">“America’s Got Talent” </a>where the Savitskys advanced to last season’s quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainians moved to the US last year with Svitlana’s 17-year-old son, Misha. They live in a trailer parked outside Lincoln Center with their nine rescue cats, ages 2 to 24.</p>
      <p>“It’s a squash, but we manage,” says Maryna, the main spokesperson for the family as her mom learns to speak English. “We love New York City.”</p>
      <p>She says the three youngest cats — Eddy, Mickey and Tosha, the troupe’s only male — have yet to make their Big Apple Circus debut, because they’re not ready for their close-ups. But Ulia, Dasha, Chupa, Topa and Linda now join Asia in the ring.</p>
      <p>They perform their various tricks in return for cuddles, pats and edible treats, but only when the mood takes them. “They are capricious,” Maryna tells The Post. “If they have the right mood, they will do it. If not, they won’t.” During one recent show, Chupa twice refused to burst through a circle of paper. Why? “We don’t know,” Maryna says, laughing.</p>
      <p>Even Svitlana has yet to discover exactly how cats think, even though she began training them for fun when she was a 10-year-old schoolgirl. She often rescued kittens from the street, where many had been attacked by dogs, and bonded with them by playing little pussycat games.</p>

      <p>Asked about “the secret” to coaching felines — a burning question from someone who’s failed to get my two cats to do anything I ask — Maryna replies: “There are lots of secrets, but you need to start when they are very young.”</p>
      <p>The first is to become the kitten’s “everything.” “You need to be their mom, dad, brother, sister, so, if something is wrong, they come to you,” says Maryna. “They need to completely trust you.”</p>
      <p>Next, don’t make any sudden moves or noises. “One incorrect intonation when you speak and they will be afraid of you,” she says. Finally, figure out the things they enjoy doing — some kitties may like to chase a ball, others, to climb — and work a trick around that action. Once you’ve figured it out, practice it over and over again.</p>
      <p>Since most felines are skittish around loud sounds, it’s surprising the Savitsky gang doesn’t get spooked by the audience’s laughter and applause. Maryna says they condition their cats by wheeling them around busy Manhattan streets in double strollers, or taking them out on leashes. The trainers also place their backstage crates close to the entrance to the ring to get the cats accustomed to the commotion.</p>
      <p>Certainly, there’s plenty else going on at the Big Apple Circus. Its Afro-Latina ringmaster, Storm Marrero — born in Brooklyn and raised in Puerto Rico — leads an all-new show featuring 30 performers from nine countries. They include spectacular umbrella juggler Kyle Driggs, aerial acrobats the Aliev Troupe and hand-balancing strongmen duo Dupla Mão Na Roda.</p>
      <p>Other highlights involve horseback-riding stunts by the Trick Riders, featuring Caleb Carinci, two stallions and a giant hamster wheel called the Wheel of Death, from which Jayson Dominguez sprightly jumps, while blind-folded.</p>
      <p>Those with a fear of clowns can relax: the closest thing here is comedian Amy Gordon, who dresses as a giant pigeon. She roller skates and crashes, makes wildly inappropriate poop jokes and desperately tries to fly.</p>
      <p>Just don’t sic the Savitsky Cats on her.</p>
