      <p>An Assam-based NGO has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the clearance by the National Green Tribunal to the 2000 MW Lower Subansiri Hydroelectric Project straddling the Assam-Arunachal border. NHPC had in 2005 started work but the construction was stopped in 2011 following anti-dam protests.</p>
      <p>On July 31, the NGT ordered NHPC to restart the project.</p>
