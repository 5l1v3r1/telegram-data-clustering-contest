      <h1>Andre Russell hails 'sexy' T10 as third edition gets going in Abu Dhabi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:10:19+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Barny Read in Abu Dhabi</a></address>
      <p>The T10 League's third edition - first under its newly minted Abu Dhabi T10 moniker and debut in the UAE capital - was given a perfect day one endorsement by one of its highest profile players on Friday, after being hailed as "so sexy" by West Indies allrounder <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/276298.html">Andre Russell</a>.</p>
      <p>Russell had hit 58 from just 24 balls to hand reigning champions Northern Warriors a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18522/game/1204577/maratha-arabians-vs-northern-warriors-1st-match-group-b-abu-dhabi-t10-2019-20">nine-wicket victory</a> over sole survivors from the inaugural tournament in 2017, Maratha Arabians.</p>
      <p>It was an exemplary batting performance from the 31-year-old - possibly short-form cricket's premier player in the world right now - and Russell clearly enjoyed the freedom that ten-over cricket encourages.</p>
      <p>"I would describe this cricket as so sexy," Russell said. "Honestly, it's just quick, spicy and I have no form of nerve going out to bat or bowling because I expect a guy to hit me for four or six and it's just a challenge for me as a bowler. Batting-wise I just know I have to get the job done... it's so much fun."</p>
      <p>Prior to the first fixture of 2019, Abu Dhabi T10 opened its curtains in customary fashion; fresh out the other side of a trying build-up, warily peered at from outsiders, talked of excitedly from within and a sense of intrigue shared by all.</p>
      <p>Two years in, the tournament's preamble wouldn't be the same without having to navigate hurdles.</p>
      <p>The first year had a circus-like feel to it, the celebrities in attendance often taking centre stage over the star-studded cast of players. It's second season put on a far more professional production but had to overcome court orders, alleged Ponzi schemes and a bitter fallout between owner-cum-chariman Shaji ul Mulk and then president Salman Iqbal.</p>
      <p>And this year's lead-up has been no different in proving a trying experience for most involved.</p>
      <p>Most tricky has been the PCB's withdrawal of previously awarded No Objection Certificates (NOCs) for its players at the behest of prime minister Imran Khan. It left a number of high-profile players out of pocket and squads with gaping holes.</p>
      <p>No franchise was hit harder than Qalandars - a branch of Pakistan Super League (PSL) outfit Lahore Qalandars - who have hastily replaced 12 of their roster, including icon player Shahid Afridi and Pakistan internationals such as Imad Wasim and Mohammad Hafeez.</p>
      <p>For the second year running, it forced a rapid reprint at the branding suppliers and, considering the marketing pull of Pakistani cricketers in the UAE, the ramifications of the PCB's decision were wide ranging.</p>
      <p>It prompted local governing body, the Emirates Cricket Board, into writing to PCB chairman Ehsan Mani, stating the absence of Pakistan players "will cause serious damage" to the league.</p>
      <p>But T10 - put forward at its two previous events by both Afridi and England captain Eoin Morgan as being cricket's best bet for breaking into the Olympic Games - knows better than most that the show must go on and their ever expanding team are now experts in crisis management.</p>
      <p>For all the nuisance of this year's biggest organisational challenge, however, there is a feel of real permanency.</p>
      <p>The 3.0 reinvention has seen the triad of Abu Dhabi Sports Council, Abu Dhabi Cricket and Abu Dhabi Tourism team with T10 for an initial five-years at Zayed Cricket Stadium, a venue growing at a rapid rate.</p>
      <p>That is no mean feat in this part of the world and, although initially planned to tie in with Diwali celebrations as a means of tapping into the Indian travel market before a clash with the recently concluded T20 World Cup Qualifiers, the infrastructure of the event is immediately slicker.</p>
      <p>Again, this is nothing to be scoffed at considering, for all its charm, history and wonderful atmosphere, how chaotic previous host Sharjah can be.</p>
      <p>Abu Dhabi will still have to tackle low attendance outside of Friday matches as well as enticing fans from other emirates to the capital, but day one brought with it a real sense of order to what is still, for now, the sport's youngest variant.</p>
      <p>An encouraging swell of support in the stands lasted the bulk of the day's remaining two games and those that stayed the distance were rewarded for their endurance.</p>
      <p>The second game saw icon captains Shane Watson (57*) and Morgan (52*) exchange half-centuries as the latter led his Delhi Bulls side to a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18522/game/1204578/deccan-gladiators-vs-delhi-bulls-2nd-match-group-a-abu-dhabi-t10-2019-20">seven-wicket victory</a> over Deccan Gladiators before Team Abu Dhabi and Qalandars played out the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18522/game/1204579/qalandars-vs-team-abu-dhabi-3rd-match-group-b-abu-dhabi-t10-2019-20">first tie</a> in T10 history, providing a dramatic opening to this year's tournament.</p>
