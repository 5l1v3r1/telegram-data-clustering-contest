      <p>Singapore—In what might possibly be a case of a double murder, the bodies of a 41-year-old Japanese woman and her 5-year-old son were discovered near Bukit Batok Nature Reserve in the early morning hours of November 14, Thursday.</p>
      <p>The body of the woman was found near a car after 6 o’clock in the morning, while her 5-year-old son’s remains were found inside the car, according to a report from <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/singapore/story20191114-1005271">Lianhe Zaobao.</a></p>
      <p>“A five-year-old boy was found motionless in a car while a 41-year old woman was found lying motionless nearby,” <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/woman-and-child-found-dead-near-bukit-timah-nature-reserve">said the police</a>.</p>
      <p>The remains of the two individuals were found along 21 Lorong Sesuai, reportedly a restricted area belonging to the state.</p>

      <p>Upon the discovery of the bodies, paramedics were called in, who pronounced both the woman and son dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>The case had been classified by the police as one of unnatural deaths, with investigations underway. Chinese-language newspaper Shin Min Daily News reported that police searched the area near Bukit Batok Nature Reserve for around six hours.</p>
      <p>Ironically, Bukit Timah was ranked last year as the number one neighborhood when it comes to safety in all of Singapore, although Bukit Timah road itself is considered to be one of the least safe roads in the country.</p>
      <p>The area is well known as a haven for the rich, with plenty of private houses and pricey properties. What’s important to note though is that crime in the area has gone down by 43 percent from 2012 through 2016.</p>
      <p>Crime data from the Singapore Police Force and Neighborhood Police Centers from 2012 to 2016 brought to light the five areas with the fewest numbers of reported crime, as well as the five areas that have shown a higher crime rate.</p>
      <p>Taken into consideration were a number of criminal acts, including car theft, housebreaking, incidents of snatching, robbery, unlicensed moneylending and unlicensed moneylending harassment.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the top five of the safest districts list are: number 2, Bishan; number 3, Kampong Java; number 4, Marine Parade; and number 5, Sembawang, despite it’s nearness to Yishun. Sembawang showed only one incident of vehicle theft in 2016, and absolutely no incidents of robberies or snatching.</p>
      <p>The top five neighborhoods with most crimes reported are: number 5. Woodlands East; number 4, Tampines; number 3, Jurong West; number 2, Nanyang; and, as mentioned earlier, number 1 is Yishun North. This should come as no surprise to anyone, given that it’s been christened a “Murderer and Siao Lang” town. Yishun North has the highest overall number of crimes and money harassment cases for Singapore in 2016. -/TISG</p>
