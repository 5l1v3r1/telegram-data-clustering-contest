      <p>Registered foreign portfolio investments, or “hot money,” posted a net inflow of $104.53 million in October 2019, a reversal of the $67.83-million net outflow a year ago, as fund managers reacted positively to the domestic and global developments during the period, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said Friday.</p>
      <p>“Domestic and international developments for the month included the progress on the US and China trade discussions; initial public offerings by firms in the industrial and services sectors; the BSP’s decision to reduce the reserve requirement ratio for universal/commercial and thrift banks by 100 basis points; and further slowdown of headline inflation to 0.8 percent in October from 0.9 percent in September,” the BSP said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The October net inflow was also a turnaround from the $231.71-million net outflow a month ago. The figure brought hot money to a net outflow of $1.225 billion since the start of the year, a reversal of the $93.89-million net inflow a year ago.</p>
