      <p><b>CONCORD, N.H.</b> - Officer Clarence is a veteran Greenfield officer and one of the first comfort dogs in the nation.</p>
      <p>He was a guest at a Concord, New Hampshire summit Friday, where officers were talking about how valuable dogs like him are becoming in law enforcement.  </p>
      <p>Officer Clarence has responded to some of the worst tragedies in the country.</p>
      <p>"We started at Sandy Hook," his partner, Greenfield Police Lt. William Gordon, said. "We've been to Boston for the bombing. Las Vegas."   </p>
      <p>Officer Clarence's secret weapon is being wicked cute. </p>
      <p>"When we bring in the dog, all of a sudden, the sun shines. The rainbow comes out," Gordon said. "It's because he is so calm. Calmness breeds calmness."</p>
      <p>Concord, NH Police hired Officer Liberty to help their department better engage crime victims and keep officers upbeat. </p>
      <p>"They have a bad shift, she's there. They pet her and talk to her. It's a wonderful experience," Concord NH Police Chief Bradley Osgood said. </p>
      <p>Comfort dog trainers say the odds of someone talking more openly go from 25 percent to 80 percent when these guys are on scene.  </p>
      <p>Westminster police use Officer Merle in the schools.</p>
      <p>"We've created more bonds in our school district than we ever had before," Westminster Officer Nathan Hawkins said. </p>
      <p>A New Hampshire lawmaker is trying to change the law so these officers can help people feel more comfortable testifying in court -- especially children.</p>
      <p>"A dog can calm someone down and make them feel better about what they are doing," Rep. Katherine Rogers (D-Merrimack) said. </p>
      <p>Officer Clarence knows what he is doing, and he knows people. He has a great disposition. For some, this line of work is in their blood and that's something Clarence hopes to pass down to the next generation of officers.</p>
