      <p>Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei on Friday called on all Muslim nations to unite and help solve the Palestinian issue as the most urgent matter in the Muslim world, while pledging continued support for people in Palestine. <br/>"Today, the most important issue facing the Muslim world is the issue of Palestine, whose people have been displaced," the Leader told ambassadors of Muslim countries and participants of the Islamic Unity Conference in Tehran, his website reported. <br/>He said the issue of Palestine and conflicts in different parts of the region are rooted in the fact that Muslim nations have not joined ranks to confront the common enemy. <br/>“Supporting the Palestinian people is one of the tenets of the Islamic Revolution,” he stressed.<br/>"Since the beginning of the Islamic Revolution till today, we have maintained our stance toward Palestine, meaning that we have helped and will continue to help Palestine and the Palestinians without any reservation, and we regard this as the duty of the entire Islamic world."<br/> </p>
      <p>  Future of the Land  Ayatollah Khamenei also said Iran is not calling for the elimination of Jewish people but rather believes that people of all religions should decide the future of the land.<br/>"We are a supporter of Palestine and want it to be independent and liberated. Calling for the elimination of Israel does not mean calling for the elimination of the Jewish people. We have no issues with them and Jews are living safely in our country," he said.<br/>The elimination of Israel means the elimination of the fake Zionist regime and that the people of Palestine who are the main owners of that land—be they Muslim, Christian or Jewish—should choose their own government. <br/>Since its Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has refused to recognize Israel and has backed Palestinian groups.<br/>Ayatollah Khamenei urged stronger unity among Muslim nations, saying that the United States, the Zionist regime and their likeminded allies are hatching plots against the Muslim world. <br/>"Islam calls for rejection of arrogance. So they are opposed to the core principles of Islamic and all Muslim states," he said. <br/>"Muslim countries should cooperate with each other toward making scientific achievements, generating wealth, promoting security and becoming politically strong, as it would lead to prosperity in the whole Islamic world." </p>

      <p>  US Presence  In his speech, the Leader criticized US military presence in the region, saying that it only causes insecurity.  "America is seeking to infiltrate into sensitive and decision-making bodies, create discord among nations, undermine trust between nations and governments, influencing decisions and creating the impression that its support to other countries can resolve all issues," he said.  Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the Islamic Republic will not surrender to foreign pressure and will continue on its chosen path.  President Hassan Rouhani also delivered a speech at the meeting, saying that Muslims today can overcome issues only by following Islamic guidelines.</p>
