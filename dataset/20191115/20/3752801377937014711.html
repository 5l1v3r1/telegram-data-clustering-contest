      <p>Driven by anger at the authorities' response to massive protests - and guilt that the burden of defending democracy has fallen on the city's youth - a white collar rebellion is rippling out across Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Every day this week thousands of office workers have downed tools for a few hours, responding to a call to strike in a cheekily named "Lunch With You" rally.</p>
      <p>Faces masked, hands held aloft, many in crisp shirts - some in suits - they chanted pro-democracy slogans and blocked roads in business districts normally characterised by a tunnel-vision for commerce, risking arrest in a rally not sanctioned by police.</p>
      <p>On Monday and Tuesday they crouched under umbrellas, as police lobbed tear gas through Central, the city's financial heart, clouds drifting across the shopfronts of designer stores.</p>
      <p>By Friday, deskbound workers deployed the tactics of street protest - including the swift formation of two lines creating a channel for black-clad "braves" to run through carrying bricks in anticipation of a police crackdown.</p>
      <p>"The least we can do is give up our lunchtime to come out and protest the government," said 33-year-old lawyer Jansen.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Greater democracy </b>
      </p>
      <p>The white collar rebels share widespread anger at the now-shelved government plan to introduce a law allowing the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China.</p>
      <p>Many initially joined the peaceful mega-rallies sanctioned by police against the bill.</p>
      <p>Older and employed in city jobs, they mainly identified as 'moderates'.</p>
      <p>But as time has passed, attitudes have calcified.</p>
      <p>Violence against young frontline protesters, a government deaf to demands for greater democracy and a lack of police accountability has brought white collar workers to the streets with renewed conviction.</p>
      <p>"We keep going to work every day like nothing is happening, no matter how many students are getting injured. But I can't bear to go on like this," said a 26-year-old office worker who gave his surname as Chan.</p>
      <p>He was wearing heavy-duty workman's gloves and helping frontliners build a roadblock in Pedder Street - one of the city's most exclusive shopping areas and moments from its major banks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Danger </b>
      </p>
      <p>"I've always been in the peaceful, rational, non-violent camp. But a lot has changed," he said.</p>
      <p>Protesters fear Hong Kong's freedoms, unique within China, are in danger.</p>
      <p>That has thrown the city's narrative of free market success and stability into perspective - more so as the economy has tipped into recession.</p>
      <p>"Some values in the community cannot be only measured in terms of money," said Lawrence, a 32-year-old suited finance professional.</p>
      <p>"What I sacrificed can never be compared with those youngsters' sacrifices," he said, adding that their "futures" are on the line.</p>
      <p>The five day strike, which saw the city's transport network targeted by roadblocks and vandalism and brought some of the most violent unrest yet, has stretched Hong Kong police.</p>
      <p>It has also prodded rebellion from the greatest beneficiaries of Hong Kong's once hallowed reputation for peace and stability.</p>
      <p>"If we're peaceful they don't listen," Ms Lau, a 52-year-old entrepreneur said.</p>
      <p>"If you're violent they say it won't solve any problems."</p>
