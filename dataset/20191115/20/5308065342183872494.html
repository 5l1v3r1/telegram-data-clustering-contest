      <p>Motorola has thrown its hat in the ring of foldable tech trends with the resurrected <b>razr</b>. The classic razr phone is given a sleek new design featuring a 6.2 inch foldable OLED panel screen.</p>
      <p>While the new razr may look similar to its 2004 flip phone counterpart, it now runs on the Android 9 Pie and includes a fingerprint sensor and USB-C charging port where the chin rest is placed.</p>
      <p>The razr is sized like any normal smartphone but folds in half into a much smaller pocketable device. The phone also features a second screen when folded showing the Quick View display with notifications, music controls, and a selfie camera mode.</p>
      <p>Motorola is confident of the razr’s durability, even throwing shade at Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 2.0. As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964205/motorola-razr-folding-phone-hinge-screen-samsung-galaxy-fold-mistakes">The Verge</a>, Motorola was quoted as saying that “We’re not going to go out there and say, ‘consumers should be cautious of how they use the phone.’”</p>
