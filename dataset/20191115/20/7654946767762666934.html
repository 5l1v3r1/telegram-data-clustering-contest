      <h1>Barbra Streisand tribute museum is an exhibition for the #MeToo era</h1>

      <p>The face on the banner fluttering above East 65th Street looks familiar. Why, it’s Barbra Streisand, the subject of a museum exhibit devoted to the way she was, is and perhaps always will be.</p>
      <p>Welcome to “Hello Gorgeous,” an eclectic show of costumes, photos, videos and more at the Bernard Museum of Judaica at Temple Emanu-el. It’s the same temple where Fanny Brice, the star Streisand played in “Funny Girl,” sent her children for Sunday school. Maybe this whole show is what Yiddish speakers call <i>beshert</i>: inevitable.</p>
      <p>“It’s the perfect exhibition for the #metoo era,” says curator Warren Klein, who calls Streisand “a strong, driven woman” — one who refused to change her surname, or her nose, to suit the norm.</p>
      <p>Klein says he had reached out to the star “through various channels,” in hopes she’d want to be involved. Alas, he says, “we had zero participation. It’s really a tribute — but if she wanted to give us something, that would be fabulous.”</p>
      <p>Instead, Klein searched the web and turned up Lou Papalas, who amassed some 100,000 pieces of Streisand-iana he keeps in six 10-by-10 storage containers near his home in Palm Springs, Calif. From them, Klein culled dozens of pieces for this exhibit, including the gown she wore on her first television special, 1965’s “My Name is Barbra,” which unspools silently on a vintage TV. The beaded gown she wore in “Funny Girl” and the robe she had as the cross-dresser in “Yentl”? They’re here, too.</p>
      <p>A yearbook from Brooklyn’s Erasmus Hall HS’s class of 1959 shows a demure-looking Streisand: her hair in an updo, her eyes looking, as always, somewhat askew. While some of her classmates listed their life’s ambitions, Babs mentioned only her activities: chorus and choral club.</p>
      <p>Two years later, she was singing in Manhattan. A 1961 contract with the Bon Soir nightclub incorrectly spells her name “Barbara” and shows her pay was $175 for a 12-show week. Displayed with it is a second contract, made out a year later. This time, “Barbra” was paid $1,250.</p>

      <p>Most of one gallery wall is papered with her record album covers, and there are lovely photos, some less familiar than others. The best shows her hanging over a kitchen sink, washing out her bras; another captures her standing starstruck beside President Kennedy. Video clips play up Streisand’s influence over pop culture, including the “Coffee Talk” skit on “Saturday Night Live” in which she suddenly appears, leaving Mike Myers, Madonna and Roseanne Barr speechless and, in Myers’ character’s case, <i>verklempt</i>. There’s also a clip of a concert salute to Israel that has the singer teleconferencing with Prime Minister Golda Meir before crooning a heartfelt rendition of Israel’s national anthem, “Hatikvah.”</p>
      <p>A karaoke booth, (mercifully) soundproofed, lets you sing along with the star on “Evergreen,” “Don’t Rain on My Parade” and a dozen other songs. And then there’s the odd <i>tchotchke</i>, like the blue teacup — displayed in a glass case, like the relic it is — that someone had the <i>chutzpah</i> to snatch from the stage when Streisand sang in Central Park.</p>
      <p>Her fans, says Klein, are hungry for even more. “People are asking me about her nails,” he says. “We could do a whole exhibit just on her hair and nails!”</p>
