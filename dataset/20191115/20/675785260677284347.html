      <h1>Study claims 'personalised' Christmas gifts more popular than shop-bought presents</h1>
      <h2>A survey commissioned by VistaPrint has revealed the top five best personalised or heartfelt gifts to receive and found one in four would rather receive something small but heartfelt than an expensive present</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:03:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:03</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Tyler Schmall, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Generic gifts purchased on the high street no longer cut it thanks to the explosion of 'personalised' Christmas presents available online, a study has found.</p>
      <p>Researchers found 65 per cent of Brits would rather receive something with a personal touch than an item widely available in chain stores.</p>
      <p>One in four would rather receive something small but heartfelt than an expensive generic present.</p>
      <p>And just eight per cent would opt for the ultimate generic gift - a voucher - rather than a more thoughtful offering.</p>
      <p>Silvia Lussana, from Vistaprint.co.uk, which commissioned the research of 2,000 consumers, said personalisation makes for more meaningful gifts.</p>

      <p>"More than ever we're finding people regard the holiday season as a way to reconnect with loved ones at the end of a hectic year," she said.</p>
      <p>"People can make these connections more meaningful, by turning their magical memories and the year's best moments with friends and family into gifts to treasure."</p>
      <p>The study also found 71 per cent would be much more likely to remember a thoughtful gift over something more generic and shop-bought.</p>

      <p>Another 65 per cent also said they would tell others about the gift if it was more personal.</p>
      <p>An intimate or special present will also stand the test of time, with six in 10 keeping these for an average of a year longer than those bought from large chains.</p>
      <p>And a third will keep it forever.</p>

      <p>But it's not just receiving a personal gift that people enjoy - it's also giving.</p>
      <p>Sixty-five per cent of those polled get more satisfaction from giving someone a personalised gift than something generic.</p>
      <p>More than half enjoy handing over a keepsake while 49 per cent like that it is a gift that will be remembered.</p>

      <p>Being able to celebrate a particular moment (44 per cent) and the gift being unique (44 per cent) are also among the reasons people like to give a personal present.</p>
      <p>But 57 per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, feel hampered by budget restrictions when it comes to buying more thoughtful gifts for a loved one.</p>
      <p>Silvia Lussana added: "We see a large spike in photo gift orders beginning in early November and lasting through to mid-December.</p>
