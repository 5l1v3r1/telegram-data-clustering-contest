      <h1>Elizabeth Warren calls for review of Canada's protections of endangered right whales</h1>

      <p>HALIFAX -- Two U.S. senators from Massachusetts, including presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, are calling for an investigation of Canada's regulatory measures to protect the North Atlantic right whale.</p>
      <p>Democrat senators Edward Markey and Warren sent a letter this week to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration arguing Canadian rules for protecting the endangered whales are less strict than those in the United States.</p>
      <p>Their request notes New England lobster fishermen are currently responding to a federal plan that reduces the amount of rope in the water and requires lines that break more easily.</p>
      <p>A necropsy of a male right whale discovered off Long Island, N.Y., on Sept. 16 concluded it likely died due to entanglement in trap lines.</p>
      <p>The whale was last spotted in late August in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and was entangled in lines at that time.</p>
      <p>As of Nov. 3, eight right whales were known to have died in Canadian waters this year out of an endangered population numbering about 400 animals.</p>
      <p>The senators say if Canada's rules are shown to be less stringent than those in the United States, then the U.S. government should consider restricting imports of Canadian fishery products.</p>
