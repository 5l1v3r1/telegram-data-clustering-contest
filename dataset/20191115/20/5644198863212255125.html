      <p>The European Union filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization on Friday against Colombia over duties imposed on frozen potato fries from Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>BRUSSELS: The European Union filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization on Friday against Colombia over duties imposed on frozen potato fries from Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Colombia imposed anti-dumping duties of between 3per cent and 8per cent on frozen fries for two years in November 2018 after complaining that the prices of these imports were artificially low.</p>

      <p>Although small in monetary terms - the EU as a whole exports just 19 million euros (US$20.9 million) of frozen fries to Colombia per year - the dispute is big in symbolism particularly for Belgium, which argues that it invented the "French" fry.</p>
      <p>The duties affect 85per cent of EU exports of frozen fries to Colombia.</p>
      <p>The duties breached WTO law in terms of substance and because of the procedure to put them in place, the European Commission said.</p>
      <p>"Despite numerous interventions with Colombia to lift the unjustified measures, we have not received a satisfactory response," EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The first step in a WTO dispute is a 60-day period of consultations. If these do not resolve the issue, the complainant can ask for a WTO panel to adjudicate.</p>
      <p>The EU and Colombia have had a trade deal in place since 2013.</p>
