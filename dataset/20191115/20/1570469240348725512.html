      <p>When Britain goes to the polls on December 12, all eyes will be on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to see if he can secure a parliamentary majority to help push through his Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>But also being played out in Johnson's constituency is a battle for supremacy between two very similar-looking intergalactic space lords.</p>
      <p>Lord Buckethead -- who bills himself as "mankind's greatest hope for survival" and "a low-budget Darth Vader with a heart" -- is a familiar figure on the British political scene, having stood against prime ministers since 1987.</p>
      <p>In 2017, he came seventh in the constituency of former PM Theresa May and gained worlwide fans when he celebrated his 249 votes by "dabbing" on stage.</p>
      <p>This time he faces a new challenger -- Count Binface, who wears what appears to be biker leathers but whose head is covered by a grey receptacle rather than a black one.</p>
      <p>The official candidate list for the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, published on Thursday, has Binface as an independent and Buckethead representing the Official Monster Raving Loony Party.</p>
      <p>In a twist, it appears that Binface is actually the man who stood as Buckethead in 2017.</p>
      <p>Politico said on Friday that comedian Jon Harvey was forced to abandon the role because of a copyright issue with the character's US creator.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Count Binface took the fight to his opponent, coming out against Brexit -- "a shitshow" he said -- and as a fan of teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg.</p>
      <p>He also argued his rebranding was very much in vogue, with politicians switching sides over Brexit since the divisive referendum in 2016.</p>
      <p>"At a time when political precedent is being broken all over the place, I find myself effectively standing against not just (current) Prime Minister Boris Johnson but also myself," he wrote.</p>
      <p>The current Buckethead has been endorsed by its US creator as a Raving Loony candidate, according to Politico.</p>
      <p>The Raving Loonies -- motto "Vote for Insanity. You know it makes sense!" -- have been a fixture of British elections since the 1980s and once had a cat as their co-leader.</p>
      <p>Johnson is looking to defend a slim majority of just over 5,000 and is expected to face a strong challenge from Labour's Ali Milani, a 25-year-old Iranian immigrant.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats, Greens and UKIP are also fielding candidates. Five other independents include a man dressed in an Elmo costume and Yace Yogenstein "Interplanetary Time Lord".</p>
      <p>It is not known what Yace Yogenstein wears on his head.</p>
