      <p>(CNN) - Former President George H.W. Bush's tried and true service dog Sully will get to loyally stand in service of his owner cast in bronze.</p>
      <p>Sully wagged into stardom when a picture of him next to Bush's casket stole hearts. He was then the highlight of the proceedings as he visited his owner one last time.</p>
      <p>On Dec. 6, Sully will get his own place at the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library Center. A bronze life-like statue by artist Susan Bahary will sit in the Fidelity corridor as a part of the memorial exhibit, the center<a href="https://twitter.com/Bush41Library/status/1195027429150072832?s=20"> said on Twitter.</a></p>

      <p>It is unclear if the statue is permanent or a special exhibit.</p>
