      <p>California authorities on Friday were holding four suspects charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with a deadly shooting at a Halloween costume party hosted at an Airbnb rental house in California.</p>
      <p>The Contra County Sheriff's office said on Thursday the four men were arrested along with a fifth man, who was charged with being an accessory to the crime and was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail. The suspects range in age from 21 to 30.</p>
      <p>The Oct. 31 shooting, which left five dead and several others wounded, occurred at a party attended by more than 100 people at a house booked through Airbnb Inc in Orinda, less than 20 miles (30 km) east of San Francisco.</p>
      <p>The incident prompted Airbnb to ban "party houses" and institute stricter guest conduct policies.</p>
      <p>"Extraordinary cooperation among multiple law enforcement agencies led to these arrests and a small measure of justice for the true victims,” Contra Costa Sheriff David Livingston said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Livingston also said two of the deceased victims inside the house had been armed and the investigation was ongoing.</p>
