      <p>Security agencies have deployed 87 gunboats to Bayelsa State to ensure surveillance of riverine areas during Saturday’s polls in the state.</p>
      <p>The Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 5, Dibal Yakadi, said this while appearing in an interview on Channels Television Friday.</p>
      <p>He said the police deployed 17 gunboats, the navy, 30, while the army supported with 40 gunboats.</p>
      <p>He added that a total of 31,100 police officera have been deployed to the eight local governments in the state, and each local government is “headed by a commissioner of police.”</p>
      <p>When the question on the death of some persons reportedly killed in Nembe local government was tossed at him, the AIG said ”the police are still investigating the incident.”</p>
      <p>Three people were reportedly killed in the riverine community on Saturday in preelection violence.</p>
      <p>Mr Yakadi, nonetheless, assured voters that the police would be on guard to ensure a violence-free election.</p>
      <p>“We have deployed enough men to secure the situation in Bayelsa. We are assuring everybody that things would be done well, as far as the police is concerned,” he assured.</p>
      <p>There have already been cases of violence recorded in the Bayelsa and Kogi, where elections are billed to take place the same day.</p>
      <p>Access to riverine areas in Bayelsa, which are only accessible by boat, has always been a major challenge for electoral officers and security operatives in all the South-south states.</p>
