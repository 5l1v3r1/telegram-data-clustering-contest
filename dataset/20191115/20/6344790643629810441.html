      <p>The FX anthology series <i>American Crime Story</i> has had two successful seasons chronicling the O.J. Simpson trial and the murder of Gianni Versace. The two seasons have won four Golden Globes and sixteen Primetime Emmy Awards. The series is incredibly well done with fantastic acting and storytelling. And now we have a new season coming up that will tell the story of the Clinton White House scandal.</p>
      <p>President Bill Clinton will be played by <b>Clive Owen</b>, best known for <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Inside Man</i>, <i>Children of Men</i>, <i>Gemini Man</i>, and the upcoming Stephen King adaptation, <i>Lisey’s Story</i>. He joins <b>Beanie Feldstein</b> (<i>Lady Bird</i>, <i>Booksmart</i>) as White House intern Monica Lewinsky, <b>Annaleigh Ashford</b> (<i>Masters of Sex</i>, <i>Late Night</i>) as Paula Jones, who sued Clinton for sexual harassment, and <b>Sarah Paulson</b> (<i>American Horror Story</i>, <i>Glass</i>, <i>American Crime Story</i>) as Linda Tripp, former U.S. civil servant who secretly recorded Lewinsky’s confidential phone calls detailing her relationship with the president.</p>
      <p>I love this series, and I think this season is going to be just as riveting as its predecessors. The actors on board are so great. I don’t know if I would have thought of Owen for this role, but I can totally see it now. I’m excited to hear the whole story.</p>
      <p><i>Impeachment: American Crime Story </i>season three is currently in pre-production, and is expected to air on FX on September 27, 2020.</p>
      <p>Are you excited for this next season? Anyone else think they should cast <b>Kate McKinnon </b>as Hillary Clinton?</p>
