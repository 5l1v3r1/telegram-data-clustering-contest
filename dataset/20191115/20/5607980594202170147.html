      <h1>Now you can buy a Linux smartphone for $150 (PinePhone BraveHeart developer/early adopter edition)</h1>

      <p>Several companies are planning to ship <a href="https://liliputing.com/tag/linux-phone">Linux smartphones</a> in the coming months. The <b>PinePhone</b> is by far the cheapest — and it could be one of the first to ship… if you’re OK spending money on a developer/early adopter edition phone.</p>
      <p>The PinePhone “BraveHeart” Limited Edition smartphone is now <a href="https://store.pine64.org/?product=pinephone-braveheart-limited-edition-linux-smartphone-for-early-adaptor">available for purchase for $150</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s set to ship in late December or early January.</p>

      <p>There are a few things that make this a BraveHeart model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Phones purchased now will be from the first mass production run.</li>
        <li>Hardware should be fully functional, but some design elements (including the 2G antenna placement) may change in future production runs.</li>
        <li>Software is very much a work in progress — the BraveHeart phone doesn’t come with an operating system pre-installed, so you’ll have to install your own build.</li>
        <li>Some firmware features may be buggy/unsupported for a while.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But those warnings are a lot easier to accept for a $150 smartphone than they would be with a higher-priced model.</p>
      <p>Want a more stable experience? Just wait a little longer. Pine64 plans to begin selling finalized hardware with more robust software in March, 2020. Those phones will still cost just $150.</p>
      <p>As you probably guessed from the price tag, the PinePhone isn’t exactly a speed demon.</p>
      <p>It’s powered by a 1.2 GHz Allwinner A64 ARM Cortex-A53 quad-core processor with Mali-400 graphics and features 2GB of LPDDR3 memory, 16GB of eMMC storage, and a 5.95 inch, 1440 x 720 pixel IPS touchscreen display.</p>
      <p>The phone has a plastic case and wireless capabilities top out at 802.11n WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0.</p>
      <p>The PinePhone does support global cellular bands though, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LTE-FDD: B1/ B2/ B3/ B4/ B5/ B7/ B8/ B12/ B13/ B18/ B19/ B20/ B25/ B26/ B28</li>
        <li>LTE-TDD: B38/ B39/ B40/ B41</li>
        <li>WCDMA: B1/ B2/ B4/ B5/ B6/ B8/ B19</li>
        <li>GSM: 850/900/1800/1900MHz</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And the phone has a few features that you won’t find on many modern flagship smartphones, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removable battery</li>
        <li>microSDXC card reader</li>
        <li>3.5mm headphone jack</li>
        <li>Kill switches to shut off WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, GPS, mic, and camera hardware</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And most importantly, it’s a phone designed to run free and open source software. Sure, you can try to unlock the bootloader and <a href="https://liliputing.com/2019/11/database-of-200-smartphones-that-can-run-linux-unofficially.html">install a phone-friendly Linux operating on an existing phone</a> — but that’s not quite as simple as buying a phone <i>designed</i> to run the software.</p>
      <p>Other PinePhone features include a USB Type-C port, and a 15 watt charger, a 5MP rear camera, 2MP front camera, and a mono speaker.</p>
      <p>The Pinephone measures 160.5mm x 76.6mm x 9.2mm and weighs 185 grams.</p>
