      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/donut_county">Donut County</a></b> is perfect if you're looking for a short, relaxing, funny puzzle game. It's an enjoyable experience that has just enough charm to justify its existence, and although some might find the relatively high price tag a tough pill to swallow for three hours <i>max</i> of content, it's a tasty little treat of a game that you can devour in a single sitting. Short and sweet, indeed.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/what_remains_of_edith_finch">What Remains of Edith Finch</a></b> is a 'Walking Simulator' that doesn’t just tell an unforgettable story – it's genuinely unforgettable. As tragic as its tale is, it always manages to entertain. As one section ends and as you fight back tears, you’ll always carry on, because the next story is as engrossing as the last. If you want a strong feature-length story that doesn’t waste a minute, Edith Finch is the one you need.</p>

      <p>With tight controls, retro-styled minimal art style and a superb sense of progression, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gato_roboto">Gato Roboto</a></b> is the perfect Metroidvania to play whilst you’re waiting for an <i>actual</i> Metroid or appropriate <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Castlevania</a></b> game. Only its difficulty leaves a bit to be desired at times - anybody with a lick of experience will likely breeze through it in no time, and its quality is such that you may end up wishing it lasted a little longer. Nevertheless, it's chock full of meaningful upgrades, secrets and spectacular boss battles to keep you joyously busy for a few hours.</p>

      <p>Several years on, there’s no denying the cultural and developmental impact <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gone_home">Gone Home</a></b> has had on the game industry. Both as a near-perfect exercise in interactive storytelling and an example of how to handle complex and very real ideas in a game, only <b><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/life_is_strange_episode_1_-_chrysalis">Life is Strange</a></b> has ever come close to matching its significance. While there still isn’t much ‘game’ to be found here, the story you unravel through exploring an empty home will stay with you long after you’ve put down your Switch. Essential.</p>

      <p>We struggle to recall a dystopia quite as cheerful as the one found in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikuniku">Pikuniku</a></b>. It’s a short game, but one packed with heart and imagination, with a great single-player component and excellent couch co-op that can genuinely be enjoyed by anyone. It makes us remember the fun we had cutting pieces from our friends in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/snipperclips_plus_cut_it_out_together">Snipperclips</a></b>, but where we occasionally hit a brick wall with that game, Pikuniku sidesteps frustration in favour of a breezy and charming adventure; a perfect salve if you need a break from the backlog, but don’t dive in expecting endless hours of gameplay.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/firewatch">Firewatch</a></b> is just as engrossing and enchanting on Switch as it was the first time around. From the warm glow of its forests in the morning summer light to the subtle tension of exploring a rocky gorge in the isolating silence of night, Shoshone National Forest is a character in its own right. With a story that’s both funny and heartbreaking – and enhanced by some brilliant performances by its two central actors – this is an essential purchase, irrespective of whether you're playing it for the first time on Switch or simply using it as an excuse to revisit an old favourite.</p>
