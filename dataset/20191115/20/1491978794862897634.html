        <i>Cold war style-agreement brings several high-profile espionage cases to a close</i>
      </p>
      <p>Russia has freed two Lithuanians and a Norwegian in return for two Russian spies held in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/lithuania">Lithuania</a>, in a cold war-style spy swap that brought several high-profile espionage cases to a close.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian, Frode Berg, a retired border guard, was arrested in Moscow in 2017 and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/16/russian-court-jails-norwegian-for-14-years-on-spying-charges-frode-berg-putin">convicted of gathering intelligence on behalf of Norway</a>. He pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg told a news conference on Friday she had spoken to Berg by phone and he would come home as soon as “practically possible”.</p>
      <p>“We are happy that Frode Berg is coming back home to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/norway">Norway</a> as a free man,” she added.</p>

      <p>Berg’s lawyer, Brynjulf Risnes, told Norwegian newspaper VG that Berg, 64, was undergoing a medical examination, and needed some peace before travelling back to Norway.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear when Berg could fly back from Lithuania, which helped to arrange the spy swap that took place at midday on Friday at a Lithuanian border post with Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave.</p>
      <p>Solberg said the actions of Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda and his country’s parliament showed “a spirit of a great ally and true friend, and we will remain grateful”.</p>
      <p>Norway has not promised any rewards to Lithuania in exchange, she added.</p>
      <p>Both Norway and Lithuania are Nato member states, and Norway has its soldiers taking part in Nato’s rotating exercises in the Baltic state, concerned about Russia’s aggressiveness.</p>
      <p>Moscow says it has no intention of invading the Baltics or Poland and accuses Nato of destabilising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> by moving troops closer to Russia’s borders.</p>
      <p>News about Berg’s release prompted celebrations in his hometown Kirkenes, in Arctic Norway.</p>

      <p>“We have been waiting for this for two years now,” Øystein Hansen, a member of a support group, told Reuters. “It is very good for all the parties, the local community, the family, the Norwegian nation.”</p>
      <p>Berg’s daughter, Christina Berg, who was waiting for her father’s return in Oslo, told Reuters: “We are so happy right now.”</p>
      <p>One of the two freed Russians, Nikolai Filipchenko, was sentenced in Lithuania in 2017 to 10 years in jail for spying.</p>
      <p>Lithuanian media reported that Filipchenko held the rank of lieutenant colonel in Russia’s federal security service (FSB) and tried to recruit the Lithuanian president’s bodyguards to bug his office.</p>
      <p>Another freed Russian, Sergej Moisejenko, was sentenced in 2017 to 10-and-a-half years for spying and illegal possession of weapons, the prosecutor’s office said.</p>
      <p>According to Lithuanian media, he tried to gather information about the nation’s armed forces and Nato’s air police mission in Lithuania.</p>
      <p>Russia freed two Lithuanians, Jevgenij Mataitis and Aristidas Tamosaitis, who were sentenced in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> in 2016 to 13 and 12 years in prison respectively for spying.</p>
      <p>Mataitis, who also holds Russian citizenship, was passing secret military information while he served as a captain in the Russian armed forces, Russian news agency Tass has said.</p>
      <p>Both freed Lithuanians were to be reunited with their families on Friday, Lithuanian officials said.</p>
