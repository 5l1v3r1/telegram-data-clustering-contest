      <h1>Georgia at Auburn: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:36:21+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Despite having one of the worst losses of the teams competing for the College Football Playoff, the Georgia Bulldogs <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/the-college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-11-have-been-released">came in at No. 4</a> in the latest rankings. That puts the Dawgs ahead of major contenders like Alabama and Oregon for now, but there isn’t a lot of room for error going forward. The schedule doesn’t slow down either, as Georgia heads to Auburn tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The Tigers have played the part of spoiler a few times in the College Football Playoff era. They’ll have a shot at causing real mayhem to end the year, starting with this weekend’s game.</p>
      <p>Gus Malzahn’s team sports one of the nation’s top defenses, and faces a Georgia offense that is generally competent and consistent, but not super explosive. The Tigers could also have a big edge up front, pitting a top defensive line against a Georgia offensive line with some questions.</p>
      <p>The Dawgs aren’t unproven, though. They are in the top four at the moment, on the back of wins over Notre Dame and Florida so far this season.</p>
      <p>If Georgia wins out, it will almost definitely make the four-team field, but it has some pretty tough Tigers it must overcome on the way there.</p>

      <p>While more attention is usually paid to Georgia’s rivalry with Florida and Auburn’s with Alabama, this is the Deep South’s Oldest Rivalry.</p>
      <p>This game dates back to 1892, and has been played 123 times in the programs’ history. Most rivalries this old are pretty skewed in one direction, as teams generally have pretty long stretches of success and failure somewhere in their history. That isn’t really the case here, though, as Georgia leads by just three games: 59-56-8.</p>
      <p>Lately, UGA has had a big edge, though. Last season, Georgia won its second straight over Auburn, 27-10, and has taken home 11 of the last 14 games in this series. When Auburn has won recently, it has signaled big things to come. In 2010, Cam Newton dominated Georgia 49-31. In 2013, the Tigers won on the Prayer at Jordan-Hare. In 2017, it helped spark them to a surprise SEC West title.</p>
