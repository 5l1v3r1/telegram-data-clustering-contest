      <h1>Sky Sports increase PPV boxing price for Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr rematch</h1>
      <h2>The two heavyweights will meet for the second time in Saudi Arabia on December 7 as Joshua bids to regain the three world titles he lost to the Mexican</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:17:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sky-sports">Sky Sports</a> are looking to cash in on the demand for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/anthony-joshua">Anthony Joshua's</a> hotly-anticipated rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr by raising the pay-per-view cost for the fight.</p>
      <p>The pair will meet again on December 7 in the follow-up to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andy-ruiz-jr">Ruiz Jr's</a> seventh-round knockout win over Joshua back in June.</p>
      <p>Joshua is hopeful of regaining the WBA, WBO and IBF world heavyweight titles that Ruiz Jr won from him that night, but knows another defeat would be damaging for his boxing career.</p>
      <p>The Brit is no stranger to the big occasion, with Sky regularly screening his bouts via their box office for a one-off fee of £19.95.</p>
      <p>However with the stakes higher for the clash with Ruiz Jr, Sky have bumped up their rates for paying viewers.</p>

      <p>Anyone looking to order the match on their television will have to stump up £24.95 this time round - a mark-up of five pounds.</p>
      <p>Joshua's most high-profile bout to date with Wladimir Klitschko attracted over £1.5 million viewers in the UK alone, with the clash with Ruiz Jr likely to command similar figures.</p>
      <p>That would see Sky rake in approximately £7.5 million in extra revenue from PPV sales alone from their increased rates to buy the fight.</p>
      <p>The contest is due to take place in in Diriyah - a suburb of Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh - where a new purpose-built stadium is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/latest-images-venue-anthony-joshua-20882448">currently being constructed</a> .</p>

      <p>And there is likely to be even more high-profile bouts in the offing should Joshua emerged victorious, with Gypsy King <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> already lining up a fight with the winner.</p>
      <p>Fury looks set to face his own rematch with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> in February, providing the American comes through his meeting with Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>But Fury told talkSPORT: "When one door closes another one opens. So if he [Wilder] loses, he loses. He’ll have a rematch with Ortiz no doubt. And I’ll look for the winner of Andy Ruiz Jr vs Anthony Joshua on the same date.</p>

      <p>"I believe 100 per cent yes. It has got to happen. I have three fights left on my contract," he added. "Deontay Wilder is next and if Wilder wants it again, he can. Then I will fight the winner of Joshua and Ruiz Jr for sure."</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr is in the mood to spoil the party again for Joshua, and has revealed he will be coming into the fight lighter than the last bout.</p>
      <p>"We've been looking really good inside the ring," Ruiz Jr told IFLTV.</p>
      <p>"I just want to be 6lbs, 8lbs lighter than I was on June 1.</p>
      <p>"That's the goal, to be 8lbs lighter, and that's going to make me feel a lot better.</p>
      <p>"It's going to make me a lot slicker, a lot faster, and that's going to tell on December 7.</p>
      <p>"I weighed in at 268 for the first Anthony Joshua fight, and I'm planning to weigh in at 260 for the next fight.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to lose too much weight because I want to be strong for December 7. We know what we're doing and what we're doing it for."</p>
