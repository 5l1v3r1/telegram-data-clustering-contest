        <b>AS someone who retired from Scotland duty, I would never criticise anyone for deciding that international football is no longer for them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Robert Snodgrass decided he’d had enough after the last San Marino get-together.</p>

      <p>Then Matt Ritchie opted out just last week.</p>
      <p>Their choice. Who am I to question their decision?</p>
      <p>But my worry is that it points to something being not quite right about Steve Clarke’s <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a>.</p>
      <p>I don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes there. I’m not privvy to any inside information, before anyone asks.</p>

      <p>It just concerns me that two Premier League players are saying they no longer want to be considered — when they are just two games away from qualifying for a major tournament.</p>
      <p>You add in the raft of call-offs and it doesn’t sit right with me.</p>
      <p>Having worked with Clarke at Kilmarnock I know for a fact he’s a top-class coach. Up there with the very best.</p>
      <p>I just worry. I just look at what’s been going on and wonder if there’s something amiss.</p>
      <p>Maybe the likes of Snoddy and Ritchie have walked away for personal reasons only and nothing else. Maybe it’s no slight on Clarke at all.</p>
      <p>And I’d never accuse anyone of claiming to be injured when there was nothing wrong with them. I just can’t see someone like Andy Robertson doing that.</p>
      <p>But this squad is only two matches away from history. And yet there still seems to be a feeling of dread.</p>
      <p>It’s like failure and disappointment still hangs over these players, even though the failings of the past have absolutely nothing to do with any of them.</p>

      <p>It’s not Clarke’s fault we haven’t qualified for anything since 1998. Yet he seems to get lumped in with the rest of the managers who haven’t managed it yet.</p>
      <p>If you ask me, there’s still a real possibilty we can make it to next summer’s finals. Like I say, we’re only two games away.</p>
      <p>But Clarke still needs to find a system and a team that’s going to give everyone the best chance of making it.</p>
      <p>The fact he’s not had his best players available to choose from yet has not made it any easier, that’s for sure. Kieran Tierney’s situation with Arsenal certainly hasn’t helped.</p>
      <p>But he still has a squad of good players.</p>
      <p>For me, he needs to find a way to get his best players in the team, Scott McTominay, James Forrest, Callum McGregor and Stevie Naismith.</p>
      <p>Naisy has had his injury problems lately but he’s the man who could shoot us to the finals, if you ask me.</p>
      <p>He’ll defend from the front as a striker but also bring others into the game with his knowledge and understanding NO other frontman in the squad has.</p>

      <p>But here’s something else Clarke should do. He should get Billy Gilmour into his squad as soon as possible. And I’m talking about next week.</p>
      <p>Gilmour was with the Under-21s against Greece at Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>But Kazakhstan at Hampden on Tuesday would be an ideal opportunity to give the young Chelsea prodigy his first full cap.</p>
      <p>I want to see him swagger his way into the team.</p>
      <p>This idea it’s too early for him, that it could ruin him, is just nonsense.</p>
      <p>Sure, we have quality players in the midfield area but Gilmour IS going to be a Scotland player sometime soon. I don’t see why he should be held back.</p>
      <p>When any other country gets a young player with undoubted talent they throw him in and get him games as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>Yet we always seem to be wary of doing that.</p>
      <p>There would be a commercial bonus in that his call-up might just add a few thousand punters onto the gate on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>I don’t know the boy personally but I can see he has an arrogance about him which is vital to reach the highest level.</p>
      <p>Clarke could even consider doing the same with striker Fraser Hornby, another player I’ve heard good things about.</p>
      <p>But Gilmour actually reminds me of a young Barry Ferguson, which is maybe the biggest compliment I could give him.</p>
      <p>People also say we’re missing the influence of Scott Brown since he retired but Gilmour can fill his shoes. Given the opportunity he could be the man to bring freshness to a stale set-up.</p>
      <p>God knows we need something right now.</p>
