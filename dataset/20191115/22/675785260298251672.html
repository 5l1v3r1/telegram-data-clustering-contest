      <h2>Saracens and Exeter have contested the last four Premiership finals but the London club have been hit with a 35-point deduction for breaking salary cap rules</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Exeter star Stuart Hogg admits it is hard to stay away from the Saracens salary cap saga he says has left team-mates feeling "hurt" and "disappointed".</p>
      <p>Marquee signing Hogg switched Glasgow for Devon at the end of Scotland's disappointing World Cup campaign and has been greeted by news which has turned the Premiership on its head.</p>
      <p>Instead of battling the Chiefs for the title, Saracens are preparing for a relegation fight after being hit with a 35-point penalty and huge fine for breaching the salary cap.</p>
      <p>Whilst director of rugby Rob Baxter has been outspoken in his criticism of their rivals, Hogg insists Exeter players are trying to stay away from the story.</p>
      <p>But he admitted the likes of Henry Slade, Jack Nowell and other players who have lost out to Saracens in three of the last four Premiership finals are feeling hard done by.</p>

      <p>"I’ve tried my best to stay away from it," Hogg said. "For me, to make sure I’m at my best and Exeter are at our best, we’ve not been concentrating on it at all.</p>
      <p>"We’ve been looking at ourselves and it’s pretty irrelevant for what we want to do because first and foremost we’re concentrating on seeing what we can do in this league. It’s pretty big news for everyone but it doesn’t really concern me.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know the ins and outs of what happened. There are people there to do a job and it’s their job to do all that kind of stuff. It’s nothing to do with me... it’s pretty irrelevant for me and the Exeter boys.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"I think everyone at the club is a bit disappointed with how things have gone. Exeter have been in the last four Premiership finals and they’ve played against Saracens three times and been beaten by them three times so there is a bit of hurt.</p>
      <p>"But it’s hard for me to comment having not been there. They are disappointed with how things have gone but we’re just concentrating on what we can do this season and making sure that we’re at our best to win trophies."</p>
      <p>Despite the title favourites being ruled out of contention by their punishment, Hogg dismissed the notion any success they achieve this year will be tainted.</p>

      <p>"You still have to play 22 games to win a trophy," he said. "For us, we’re just concentrating on that. I think if we were to win the league this year everybody would look at us and say it’s because Saracens are down there. But if Saracens are still at the top we plan on beating them as well.</p>
      <p>"As I say it’s a long old season for us to be in a position to win trophies but we’re going to do our best to make sure we’re in that situation.</p>
      <p>"Everybody is going to have an opinion, everybody is entitled to that opinion but for us we’ll make sure we’re at our best and hopefully lifting a trophy at the end of the season."</p>
      <p>Exeter launch their European Rugby Champions Cup campaign at La Rochelle on Saturday with a big push to convert their recent domestic success into a deep European run.</p>

      <p>Hogg added: "It’s an exciting challenge for us. This is why you play rugby, you want to be in the biggest competitions against the best teams and we’re excited for it.</p>
      <p>"We’ve not done too well in Europe. I’ve been at Glasgow for the last nine years and we didn’t qualify many times there as well.</p>
      <p>"There is a lot of experience at the club and the boys are hoping to qualify this season and make sure we’re in a position to win trophies because we truly believe we’re the best in England and we should be competing for trophies in everything we’re doing."</p>
