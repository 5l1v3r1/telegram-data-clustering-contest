      <p>Arguably <i>Justice League</i>’s biggest not-so-secret secret was that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477103/allegedly-henry-cavill-would-still-play-superman-under-one-condition">Henry Cavill’s Superman</a> would be resurrected, as the Man of Steel sacrificed his life <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2315691/how-justice-league-called-back-to-batman-v-supermans-doomsday-fight">to stop Doomsday</a> at the end of <i>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</i>. But, just like so many <i>Justice League</i> plot elements, it seems as though Superman being brought back to life might have unfolded differently in <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483683/yes-jason-momoa-has-seen-the-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-and-its-very-different">Zack Snyder’s original version, i.e. the Snyder Cut</a>, compared to the theatrical version.</p>
      <p>You may have noticed this week that Zack Snyder’s been <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484603/deleted-justice-league-scene-shows-cyborg-defending-star-labs-from-an-attack">sharing more pictures than usual from the Snyder Cut</a>, including <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484870/newest-snyder-cut-image-is-all-about-jason-momoas-aquaman">one of Jason Momoa’s Aquaman just a few hours ago</a>. Well, he’s already posted another one on <a href="https://vero.co/">Vero</a> teasing Superman’s resurrection. Check it out!</p>

      <p>Superman’s return to life was foreshadowed when <i>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</i> ended with the handful of dirt on Superman’s not-yet-buried coffin suddenly start floating. However, if it hadn’t been for Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman, Kal-El/Clark Kent wouldn’t have ever breathed air again.</p>
      <p>Around the halfway point of <i>Justice League</i>, Batman decided that Superman needed to be resurrected, both to help and the other heroes defeat Steppenwolf, and to restore hope to mankind. The Kryptonian’s body was subsequently exhumed, submerged in the Kryptonian scout ship’s genesis chamber and jolted back to life by a Mother Box activated by a lightning bolt generated by The Flash. At first, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1727640/why-superman-behaves-the-way-that-he-does-in-that-pivotal-justice-league-scene">Superman was enraged and fought the other heroes</a>, but after calming down with Lois Lane’s help, he retrieved a new suit and flew to Russia to assist the other Justice Leaguers in stopping Steppenwolf.</p>
      <p>Although there were <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2310771/the-deleted-scenes-that-are-actually-on-the-justice-league-home-release">deleted scenes attached to <i>Justice League</i>’s home media release</a> showing where Superman obtained his new suit and visiting Alfred Pennyworth afterwards, of all the information that’s been released about the Snyder Cut in the last two years, no details have really emerged on how Zack Snyder’s version of the resurrection would have differed from what we saw, if at all. That said, clearly that scene was affected by the Joss Whedon-overseen reshoots since Henry Cavill’s upper lip was plastered with that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2464097/hbo-is-still-having-the-best-time-with-henry-cavills-mustachegate">questionable, mustache-covering CGI</a>.</p>
      <p>But if the above picture that Zack Snyder shared is any indication, the filmmaker had something different in mind with the way Superman’s resurrection played out in <i>Justice League</i>. Whether we’ll ever see this earlier version remains to be seen, but there certain isn’t any lack of fans who are wanting to see what Zack Snyder’s <i>Justice League</i> looks like.</p>
      <p>The #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement has been chugging along steadily since <i>Justice League</i> was released in theaters two years ago, but it’s been picking up steam over the last several months, and apparently <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484404/why-this-could-be-a-huge-week-for-justice-leagues-release-the-snyder-cut-movement">something big is happening on Sunday</a> tied to <i>Justice League</i>’s 2nd anniversary. Will it finally be announced that the Snyder Cut is coming out, either through a traditional home media release or as an HBO Max exclusive? Or is this just another attempt to convince Warner Bros that the Snyder Cut is worth showing to the public?</p>
