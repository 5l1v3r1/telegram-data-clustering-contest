      <h2>The football pundit, who is already favourite to win I'm A Celeb, said that he hopes someone is looking out for him when he sleepwalks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>Ian Wright admits he could cause a stir in camp as he sleep walks and will need a camp mate to put him back to bed.</p>
      <p>Footballer and now pundit Wrighty, who is bookmakers' favourite to be crowned king of the jungle, said: “The fact is I'll probably be asleep so I don't know what I will do. I can't answer.</p>
      <p>"If I do sleepwalk and they direct me back to the bed, that's what my mum used to do as a kid. Dennis Bergkamp used to turn me back round towards my bed, all I need is someone to turn me back round towards the bed.</p>
      <p>“Let's hope that somebody is looking out for me. I haven't sleptwalk in a while but this is different environment isn't it. Hopefully it'll happen and we can all have a laugh.”</p>
      <p>In recent months Wrighty, 56, has won over viewers with his honest approach to tackle problems in football including racism. He is not afraid to show or share his feelings.</p>

      <p>The former Arsenal and England footballer also says he expects to show his softer side and cry in camp if things get emotional or thoughts turn to his wife.</p>
      <p>He said: “Blokes in general crying is something people do, so people like to see it. If it's genuine, you don't want to see some guy bawling his eyes out just because he's stubbed his toe.</p>
      <p>"There's reasons for people to be emotional, I'm a very emotional guy and in the right circumstances your emotions come out. Like I say, you don't want to be crying for no reason, and people think what's up with him?</p>

      <p>"If the situation arises, you're going to be under a lot of emotional pressure, with respects of food and tiredness and stress.</p>
      <p>"So those things can get to people. You shouldn't be afraid to show those feelings, I'm not afraid at all. It's nice to have a little cry.</p>
      <p>“I haven't spoke to my wife since I left on Saturday(last weekend) that's never happened where I havent spoken to her for this long. And I haven't even got in yet. It's already very difficult.”</p>
      <p>Wrighty also praised Ant McPartlin for returning to the show after his drink and drug setbacks which meant he was in rehab last year.</p>
      <p>He said: “Everybody feels like they're friends with Ant and Dec don't they. I know them from being in and around the circuit and knowing them for years, they play golf, I've done shows with them before.</p>

      <p>"They're just two people I adore. And with Shearer being my main man, them all being Geordies, I'm an honorary Geordie. It's all fun.</p>
      <p>"We've got it where Ant is back, I'm so pleased how he's come back and he's back on it. Everyone's pleased to see the duo back and let's be honest they are the guys. They're the guvnors.”</p>
      <p>And despite picking up a big fee for appearing on this ITV show for just three weeks, he insists this will be his first and last reality TV Show and he will be back as a football pundit in 2020.</p>
      <p>He said: “ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> is one that I will categorically tell everybody, that I will never see me on. This is it for me. Once I've done this!”</p>
