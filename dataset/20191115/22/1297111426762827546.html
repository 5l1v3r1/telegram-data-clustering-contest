      <h1>Stephen Harper part of Sask. trade mission to India to grow exports</h1>
      <h2>With the help of the former prime minister, the provincial government hopes to increase Saskatchewan's exports to India.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:11:52+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/lgiesbrechtpostmedia" target="_blank">Lynn Giesbrecht</a></address>
      <p>Saskatchewan’s trade and export development minister is heading out for a week-long trade mission to India accompanied by Stephen Harper, just two days after the provincial government announced a one-year contract with the former prime minister.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/sask-party-pledges-to-help-farmers-as-part-of-new-growth-plan">On Thursday, Premier Scott Moe unveiled a new economic growth plan for the province, which included a $240,000 one-year contract with Harper and Associates — the Calgary-based “global affairs” firm Harper started after leaving politics — and plans for three new trade offices in India, Japan and Singapore.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Jeremy Harrison, minister of trade and export development, told reporters on Friday that Harper’s firm has had a “significant role” in planning the trade mission and that Harper will be present for any meetings during the trip from Nov. 16 to 23.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan has seen a sharp drop in exports to India over the last four years, said Harrison, from nearly $2 billion in 2015 to $650 million last year. He pointed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s trip to India in February 2018 as one of the contributing factors to this decline.</p>
      <p>“I was critical of that mission because it did nothing to advance our trade interests, who are the predominant trade partner with India. It’s mainly Saskatchewan that has a trading relationship with India … and we were very badly hurt because of what happened during that trip,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I know whether I would rather have with us on this mission to India the former or current prime minister accompanying us and who will make a better impact for our province.”</p>
      <p>Harrison noted that following Trudeau’s mission to India, Canada saw stiff tariffs imposed on pulse exports and a significant drop in trade with the country.</p>
      <p>While in India with Harper, Harrison said he hopes to “re-establish” trading relationships and grow the province’s pulse, potash and uranium exports to the region. Representatives from Regina-based company AGT Foods and Saskatoon-based uranium company Cameco will also be on the trip.</p>
      <p>Carl Potts, executive director of Saskatchewan Pulse Growers, said the province’s pulse farmers need transparency and predictability after two difficult years of trade with the country that is usually their biggest export market.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been facing market access restrictions over the last two years into India with high import duties and quantitative restrictions, so we’re hopeful that a government-to-government engagement from Saskatchewan and India can help to remove those barriers over time,” said Potts.</p>
      <p>Since India slapped import duties on Canadian pulses in 2017, Potts said export levels have dropped, leading to lower pulse prices for Saskatchewan farmers. He hopes this mission will help the province understand India’s goals better and keep pressure on the country to become more “trade-friendly.”</p>
      <p>As for the plan to establish a trade office in India, Harrison said this is one way the provincial government can <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/politics/scott-moe-disappointed-to-hear-nothing-new-from-prime-minister-trudeau-at-meeting">show more autonomy from the federal government — a point Moe made earlier this week after what he called a “disappointing” meeting with Trudeau on divisive issues like carbon pricing and equalization.</a></p>
      <p>“It’s asserting authority that we have and asserting economic interests that we have internationally,” said Harrison. “We need to be looking out for our interests as a province.”</p>
      <p>He pointed to Alberta’s long-standing trade offices in Japan and Korea as proof that international trade offices are a tried and true way of developing long-term trade relationships.</p>
      <p>“As Saskatchewan, we need to be there. Sustained, long-term relationships are very important.”</p>
