      <p>The teenager who opened fire at his Southern California high school — <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/police-responding-to-report-of-school-shooting-in-california/">killing two fellow students and wounding three others</a> — was an apparently skilled shooter who had access to a slew of guns, police officials said Friday.</p>
      <p>Armed with a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/santa-clarita-high-school-shooter-identified-as-nathaniel-berhow/">alleged shooter 16-year-old Nathaniel Berhow</a> carried out the deadly rampage at Santa Clarita’s Saugus High School Thursday morning and turned the gun on himself in just 16 seconds, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters Friday.</p>
      <p>During that short window, the shooter quickly “cleared a malfunction” on the gun and unloaded approximately six bullets, emptying the weapon, Villanueva said, noting that surveillance video which captured the attack apparently showed the suspect “counting his rounds.”</p>
      <p>“We know it was a planned attack. It was deliberate. He knew how many rounds he had, for example,” Villanueva said, adding, “He seemed very familiar with firing the weapon.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff noted that shooter, who remains in critical condition after shooting himself in the head, was dropped off at 2,300-student school by his mother before the 7:38 a.m. attack.</p>
      <p>“As far as we know the actual targets were at random,” Villanueva said. “He was just standing by himself, walked to the center of the quad center, dropped the backpack, and just started firing.”</p>
      <p>Authorities recovered several firearms from the suspect’s home, as well as six firearms that were registered to the shooter’s late father, identified as Mark Berhow.</p>
      <p>The origins of the gun the teen shooter used in the attack remained unclear, said Villanueva, who added that several of the weapons found in the house “were not the ones registered to the father” and some were even unregistered.</p>
      <p>Mark Berhow, who died in December 2017, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/santa-clarita-shooting-dad-of-nathaniel-berhow-was-avid-hunter-who-used-to-make-bullets-reports/">was an “avid sportsman”</a> who “loved big game hunting and fishing of all kinds,” according to an obituary for him.</p>
      <p>A former childhood friend of the suspect, 20-year-old Ryan McCracken, told KTLA that Mark Berhow “used to make bullets.”</p>
      <p>Villanueva said Friday that it remained “a mystery” as to why teen shot up his high school.</p>
      <p>He did not leave any manifesto or notes, officials said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, officials said three off-duty law enforcement officers were the first to respond to the call of shots fired at Saugus HS.</p>
      <p>Det. Dan Finn, a veteran officer with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department who was dropping off his girlfriend’s son off at the school, is among those officers who were the first on the scene.</p>
      <p>“As I passed the school, I saw several hundred students running off-campus,” said Finn, who was then told by a student “there were gunshots on campus.”</p>
      <p>Finn said he quickly notified the sheriff’s station and as he entered the campus he was joined by an officer from the Inglewood Police Department where they found the grim scene of three shot students.</p>
      <p>“There were no [other] students. The vast majority either exited or safely secured in a building,” Finn said. “As I came into the quad area I observed three victims lying on the ground.”</p>
      <p>Finn and the other officer rendered medical to the students.</p>
      <p>“We started assessing their wounds and trying to pack the wounds and stabilize them,” the detective said.</p>
      <p>Finn said that at that point he was not aware who the shooter was, but “there were suspicions.”</p>
      <p>“My main concern was securing the scene, treating the victims and trying to make sure there was not an additional shooter on campus,” he said.</p>
