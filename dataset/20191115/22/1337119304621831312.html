      <h1>John Legere reportedly won’t become WeWork’s next CEO</h1>
      <h2>He has no plans to leave T-Mobile</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:10:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chris-welch" target="_blank">Chris Welch</a></address>
      <p>Turning around the mess that is WeWork isn’t going to be up to John Legere. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/john-legere-isnt-leaving-t-mobile-to-take-wework-ceo-job.html">According to CNBC</a>, the current T-Mobile CEO does not intend to take the chief executive role, despite rumors earlier this week that WeWork was strongly pursuing him.</p>
      <p>Legere “has no plans” to depart T-Mobile as it nears completion of its merger with Sprint, CNBC says. Both the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission have greenlit the combined mega-carrier, but it still faces one final challenge: numerous state attorneys general are attempting to block the deal with a lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Through his brash presentation style and a series of “Uncarrier” customer initiatives, Legere is credited for helming T-Mobile’s impressive comeback from a stagnant fourth place position among US carriers into a company that continues to see strong growth. Though T-Mobile is the third-largest carrier right now, it will become far more powerful when it adds Sprint’s customers to its ranks.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, T-Mobile announced the first programs it will launch if and when the Sprint deal successfully goes through, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953330/tmobile-sprint-first-responders-free-5g-ten-years-merger-connecting-heroes">free 5G service</a> for first responders and “Project 10Million,” an effort to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953425/tmobile-sprint-merger-homework-gap-5g-for-good">bring free internet to 10 million under-connected homes</a>. Both are fairly blatant goodwill moves meant to drum up support for the merger.</p>
      <p>Had Legere shifted over to WeWork, it would’ve raised some eyebrows. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20928050/softbank-wework-buyout-marcelo-claure">Softbank, which now controls WeWork</a>, is also the majority owner of Sprint — until T-Mobile’s acquisition of the company is complete, at least. And Marcelo Claure, who campaigned for the industry-changing merger beside Legere, was recently elected executive chairman of WeWork.</p>
