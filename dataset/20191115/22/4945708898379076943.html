      <p>The US Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a software copyright case pitting Oracle against Google in which billions of dollars is at stake.</p>
      <p>The justices allowed an appeal by Google to move forward in the case dating back to 2010 when Oracle, a major business software and cloud firm, sought billions in damages from Google over its use of Java programming language in its Android smartphone operating system.</p>
      <p>The original jury trial ended with a jury deciding that Google's "software interface" did not unfairly use Java code, saving the internet giant from a possible multibillion-dollar verdict.</p>
      <p>But an appeals court last year disagreed, saying the software is entitled to copyright protection.</p>
      <p>Oracle, which obtained the rights to the software when it acquired Sun Microsystems, had been seeking $9 billion in damages.</p>
      <p>Google argued that Sun "applauded" the use of Java, and that the lawsuit came only after that firm was acquired by Oracle.</p>
      <p>Google and a number of Silicon Valley allies also argued that extending <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/copyright+protection/">copyright protection</a> to bits of code, called <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/application+programming+interfaces/">application programming interfaces</a>, or APIs, would threaten innovation.</p>
