      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security">Border Patrol</a> agent shot and wounded a Russian citizen who appeared to be trying to enter the United States <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants">illegally</a> from Mexico, the Border Patrol said.</p>
      <p>The agent was trying to arrest the man just after 7:15 p.m. on the U.S.-Mexico border east of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona">Lukeville, Ariz</a>., Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"As the agent attempted to arrest the subject, a physical altercation ensued, and the agent discharged his firearm, striking the subject," CBP said.</p>
