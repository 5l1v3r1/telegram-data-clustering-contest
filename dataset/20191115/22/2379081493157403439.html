      <h1>S&amp;P downgrades Lebanon's credit rating amidst ongoing protests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:23:18+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:23</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>S&amp;P Global Ratings said on Friday that it lowered Lebanon’s long-term and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings to ‘CCC/C’ from ‘B-/B’, citing rising financial and monetary risks.</p>
      <p>The outlook on Lebanon is negative, S&amp;P said <a href="http://bit.ly/2CLNmyt">http://bit.ly/2CLNmyt</a>, specifying that it reflects the risk to Lebanon’s creditworthiness from rising financial and monetary pressures tied to recent widespread protests and the resignation of the government.</p>
      <p>Nationwide protests driven in part by the worst economic crisis since the country’s 1975-1990 civil war have shut banks and paralyzed the country, limiting the ability of many importers to purchase from abroad.</p>
      <p>Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister on Oct. 29 in the face of the protests against ruling politicians who are blamed for rampant state corruption.</p>
      <p>Mohammad Safadi, a former finance minister, has agreed to be Lebanon’s prime minister if he wins the support of the leading parties, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said earlier on Friday.</p>
      <p>Confidence in the country’s governance and its economy is falling, which has led to a reversal in bank deposit inflows, S&amp;P noted, adding that the Lebanese government will need external donor support or a major domestic reform package to continue its general government debt.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the ratings agency lowered the ratings on three Lebanese banks – Bank Audi, Blom Bank and Bankmed – further into junk, citing rising liquidity pressures. (Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sandra Maler)</p>
