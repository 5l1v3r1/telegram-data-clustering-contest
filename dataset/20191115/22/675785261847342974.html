      <h2>Gareth Bale has been linked with transfers to Man Utd, Man City and the Chinese Super League in recent times as his time at Real Madrid appears to be heading towards a climax</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Bale admits he gets “more excited” playing for Wales than <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> as his Spain woes continue to mount.</p>
      <p>Bale is getting yet more stick in Spain after turning up for international duty despite having not played for Real since October 5.</p>
      <p>The star has not featured since scoring in Wales’ 1-1 draw against Croatia on October 13 after sustaining a calf injury in the closing stages of the Euro 2020 qualifier.</p>
      <p>He admits playing for his country is extra special after his Spanish spell turned sour when boss Zinedine Zidane tried to force him out this summer.</p>

      <p>Asked if playing for Wales gave him more “joy” ahead of today’s qualifier in Azerbaijan, Bale replied: “Yes definitely.</p>
      <p>“It’s like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been with most of the older players since we were in Under-17s.</p>
      <p>“It’s normal - with Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feel more comfortable. I definitely have a bit more excitement playing with Wales.</p>
      <p>“But it doesn’t change what I give on the pitch. I always give 100% on the pitch wherever I am.”</p>

      <p>Bale has been criticised by Real team-mate Toni Kroos for joining up with Wales having missed club games, with the German saying “maybe this is not the best time”.</p>
      <p>Predrag Mijatovic, the former Real striker, also added to the flak by saying Bale’s priorities are “Wales, golf, and after that Real Madrid”.</p>
      <p>Bale admits “it doesn’t look good” he is now fit again for Wales after not playing for Madrid.</p>
      <p>But he insists he has not been avoiding playing for them ahead of Wales’ crunch penultimate qualifier in Baku.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’ve tried to get back as quickly as I could. If Real Madrid had a game this weekend I’d have been fit and training to play.</p>

      <p>“I guess maybe to them it doesn’t look good but it is a coincidence the national team has come by and I have returned to full training.</p>
      <p>“If I’m fit, no matter where I am, I’m going to try to play, whether it’s Wales or Madrid and I will give my all.”</p>
      <p>But debate over Bale’s commitment to Real continues to rage as he has more than two years left on a huge contract worth more than £600,000-a-week.</p>
      <p>He didn’t help himself when he refused to hold the Madrid pennant in the team photo before kick off against PSG in the Champions League loss in September – in a social media clip which went viral.</p>
      <p>But he subsequently held the Wales pennant with a smile on his face in Slovakia and is likely to fulfil the task again tonight.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think that was a funny video. My friend sent it to me. I don’t normally hold it but if it’s with me I’m sure I’ll hold it.”</p>
      <p>Bale’s biggest priority is adding to his 32 goals in 81 caps by firing Wales back to the Euros where they made the last four in 2016.</p>
      <p>Asked about the importance of qualification ahead of today’s game and the visit of Hungary on Tuesday in the last qualifier, Bale added: “It’s one of my goals. It’s the one that’ll come first. A draw isn’t in our mindset.</p>
      <p>“We know what we have to do and we know the pressure but we have to embrace it.</p>
      <p>“We still have a chance and we’ll be giving it everything we can.”</p>
