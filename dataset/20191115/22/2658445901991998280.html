          <b>Prof. Edward Olorunsola Olanipekun was recently appointed the eighth Vice Chancellor of Ekiti State University (EKSU). In this interview with ADEGUNLE OLUGBAMILA, the professor of Industrial Chemistry speaks on his plans for the 37-year-old institution, the challenges ahead and why some projects are delayed, among other issues.</b>

      <p>What was your biggest challenge when you assumed duty as the Vice Chancellor of EKSU?</p>
      <p>The greatest challenge was that the university is largely non-residential. This is not a good thing for any 21st Century institution that aims to be world class. Besides, there is no staff quarters on the campus. Even the Vice Chancellor’s Lodge is non-existent. However, we shall soon have a befitting VC Lodge.</p>

      <p>Two, we have genuine investors desirous of partnering with us. So, we will be signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with some of them. Interestingly, there is an investor willing to provide accommodation for at least 5,000 students on campus. He has assured us that the project would be ready in a year. I have the proposal and the drawing. As soon as I go through it, we shall invite them for a meeting.</p>
      <p>You seem to be very concerned about lodging for principal officers and students…</p>
      <p>As scholars, living on campus has many advantages. I have a study room in my personal house. However, once it comes to real research, you cannot compare such study room with the amount of research you will carry out in an academic environment. For instance, I am a professor of Chemistry. There are certain experiments one might need to carry out for 14 hours non-stop. That’s the essence of undertaking such experiment in an academic environment.</p>
      <p>As regards accommodation, it is a pity that once it is about 4 pm, this university becomes virtually empty. I am believing in God that within a year, we are going to change the face of this institution.</p>
      <p>Considering that EKSU has a population of over 24,000 students, don’t you think a hostel accommodating only 5000 students is like a drop in the ocean?</p>
      <p>Do not forget that this is the starting point. If we can have at least 5000 students on campus, this will automatically change the face of EKSU. Not up to 200 students and no staff member lives on campus. Another investor came here to provide hostel accommodation for about 200 students, but I disagreed that we will only accommodate an investor providing hostel accommodation for no fewer than 2000. Our plan is that new and final year students should stay on campus. Thereafter, we can extend to other levels as facilities increase.</p>
      <p>We also saw generators littering the corridors of some offices. That shows there is a challenge of power, right?</p>
      <p>Your observation is in order. However, let me say some investors have also shown interest to erect power plant for us. We have two of them and we hope to enter into an agreement with them within the next few weeks. Interestingly, their investment will not cost the university a dime. They will be providing the services just like a DisCo (distribution company) and we will just be paying. One of the investors told me it would take just three months’ gestational period to have 24-hour power supply on the campus. Once everything is fine-tuned, they immediately mobilise equipment to site.</p>

      <p>A university runs on committee system. Much as I would have loved certain things executed at my speed, respect must be accorded due process; so this might delay some of the projects.</p>
      <p>Is it true that your administration inherited huge outstanding bills?</p>
      <p>It is correct. However, let me thank our Visitor (Ekiti State) Governor (Kayode) Fayemi. Without him, our College of Medicine would have, perhaps, become history by now. That college (of Medicine) took off years back but was abolished at a point. The same situation would have repeated itself but for the governor’s kind intervention. Thankfully, EKSU has produced its first set of medical doctors and all thanks to him.</p>
      <p>We are about to have our accreditation next (this) week, and the governor has also assisted us financially. As someone from the academia, he understands the modus operandi of the university system. It is on record that during his (Fayemi) first term in office, he gave this university millions of naira which were used to complement funds from intervening agencies. Unfortunately, not a single penny has come to the university since he left.</p>
      <p>Let me tell you that the governor has also approved almost N1 billion as capital vote for this university; and it will be released any moment from now. We actually inherited a number of unsettled bills, but since the governor came on board, he has been releasing our subvention as and when due.</p>
      <p>Are there ways the university’s leadership has been reciprocating the government’s gesture?</p>
      <p>We have been cutting our coat according to available resources. We are trying to be prudent as well as block all forms of financial haemorrhage in the system. We have introduced what I can described as austerity measures. I want to thank the workers across board for showing a great deal of understanding, especially on some tough measures we have introduced in order to conserve resources.</p>
      <p>Did you have a blueprint before assuming the leadership?</p>
      <p>I have not yet put my vision in black and white. I hope to do that before the year runs out. Nonetheless, my vision is to propel EKSU as a 21st Century institution that is globally competitive. The institution shall be dedicated to cutting-edge research and training of entrepreneurial-minded graduates. I want a university that would be less-dependent on subvention; to make EKSU one of the foremost universities on the continent, with international recognition.</p>
      <p>As an insider, what are the gaps you noticed in terms of indiscipline among the staff and students?</p>
      <p>Let me first acknowledge that no system all over the world is perfect. Nevertheless, I want to say that our staff and students are people anybody can be proud of any time. The university is still owing them and they could have used that opportunity to frustrate this interview. They have shown us understanding and given me a great deal of support since I assumed office. Above all, they are committed to realising the dreams and vision of this new administration.</p>
      <p>But that will not take away the fact that indiscipline still exists…</p>
      <p>I agree with you. There are pockets of issues here and there, but they know I’m not a pretender. Any moment from now, we shall erect a billboard at the entrance of EKSU to warn everybody not to run foul of the rules. Secondly, we are going to install a centrally-controlled complaint box where students and workers can drop their complaints. This administration will not tolerate any staff or students found to have contravened the law of the university. We will not be afraid to implement the decision taken by any disciplinary committee in respect of infractions, however high or low such a person is.</p>
      <p>We do hear of allegations of sexual harassment and other misconducts in EKSU. Can your administration handle them?</p>
      <p>There was a video on the social media about one of our lecturers in alleged sexual misconduct. You know the outcome of that matter. That tells you and others the direction this administration is heading. But let me tell you that my challenge is that some of the (victimised) students are scared to speak up.</p>
      <p>But students will remain voiceless because we all know that in most universities in Nigeria, the system does not protect them…</p>
      <p>That might be right anyway. But there is another case of sexual harassment we have just set up a committee to look into. We are awaiting the report of that committee. Nonetheless, what we often realise is that majority of students are afraid. Based on my antecedents, I won’t tolerate indiscipline. I have said it at various fora that whoever violates any of the rules will face the music.</p>
      <p>Last week, an NGO visited me, supposedly to partner with EKSU on gender-based violence (GBV). I took its proposal to the management</p>
