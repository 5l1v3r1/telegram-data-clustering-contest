      <p>Tim Henman rated <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roger-federer/">Roger Federer</a>’s performance against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/novak-djokovic/">Novak Djokovic</a> as ‘one of his very best’ and backed the 20-time Grand Slam champion to go on and win the ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>Federer was at his ruthless best as he downed his great rival in straight sets, serving meticulously in a 6-4 6-3 win on Thursday night at the O2.</p>
      <p>He will take on Stefanos Tsitsipas in the next round, with Dominic Thiem facing Alexander Zverev in the other semi-final.</p>
      <p>And former British No. 1 Henman believes Federer is the man to beat at the O2.</p>

      <p>‘Yeah, I think he probably is [the favourite],’ said Henman. ‘It was an amazing performance.</p>
      <p>‘I was sort of disappointed in myself almost that we sit in the commentary box and try and write him off. On an indoor court that’s playing a bit quick, that’s borderline naïve. The way he played, serving the quality, the consistency – he was up six or seven miles per hour on speed. I think it was hotter in there last night, made it a bit quicker.</p>

      <p>‘Every time he got the chance to pull the trigger from the baseline, he did. And he didn’t make many unforced errors. One of his very best performances I have seen. Now getting through to the semis he takes huge confidence from that.’</p>
      <p>It’s been one of the most thrilling ATP Finals tournaments in recent memory and Henman has relished the unpredictable nature of the event.</p>
      <p>‘What I like about this year, in previous years we have seen good tennis but it has been quite predictable,’ he added.</p>
      <p>‘You look at the results that we have had. First day we had [Stefanos] Tsitsipas, who had never beaten [Daniil] Medvedev, [Alexander] Zverev had never beaten [Rafael] Nadal – they were up sets.</p>
      <p>‘Thiem playing as well as he did beating Federer and Djokovic. Still Djokovic I thought was the favourite and Federer plays like that. Nadal 5-1 down – it has been brilliant.</p>
