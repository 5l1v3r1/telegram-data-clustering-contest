      <p>Hitting back at Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mamata-banerjee">Mamata Banerjee</a>’s remark that some people have become mouthpiece of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a>, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday said some people are using their tongue too often and very loosely.</p>
      <p>“Some people are using their tongue too often and very loosely. There is no need to play every ball in the game of cricket. I would continue to serve the people of the state,” Dhankhar told reporters.</p>
      <p>Taking a veiled dig at Dhankar, Banerjee on Thursday said, “There are some people who are behaving just like a BJP mouthpiece. They want to run a parallel administration. Central government is an elected body and the state government is also an elected body. Federal structure must work as per our Constitution. It should be allowed to work. The central government works as per constitutional provisions and the state government must work in a similar manner,” Banerjee said.</p>
      <p>Responding, the Governor said, “No one should make a comment without properly understanding my statements.”</p>
      <p>The Governor also slammed the state government for not responding to his request for a helicopter to travel 600 km on Friday. Earlier this week, the Governor requested for a helicopter to travel to Farakka in Murshidabad district. However, according to a Raj Bhavan statement, the state government did not respond till Thursday. “Whenever I get a communication from the chief minister, I respond within 24 hours,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dhankhar visited Farakka on Friday morning to attend a programme at SNH College.</p>
      <p>The statement said the request for the chopper was made well in advance but there was no response from the administration.</p>
      <p>The TMC had questioned the need for a helicopter for the Governor’s travel.</p>
