      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- New York City was hit with a flurry of tough lessons after <a href="https://abc7ny.com/weather/no-one-predicted-the-severity-of-thursdays-snowstorm-why/4707161/">last year's "Snowvember" storm</a> brought the area to a screeching halt. Here's how they have prepared this year.</p>
      <p>It was just a few inches of snow, but for a few hours one year ago, the greatest city in the world was frozen in place.</p>
      <p>The unexpectedly strong storm left a surprising coating of snow on untreated streets that in a flash became skating rinks.</p>
      <p>Buses running without chains lost all traction, and the cars -- the tens of thousands of cars -- got stuck and blocked each other while sanitation trucks tried to lay down salt.</p>
      <p>It was chaos.</p>
      <p>"Weather can be very frustrating for me," New York City Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia said.</p>
      <p>Garcia may have one of the toughest jobs on the planet. As Sanitation Commissioner, she's responsible for clearing the roads.</p>
      <p>She says the problem last year was a forecast that got worse after everyone drove to work. When they all hit the road early to try to get home, the snow had already started -- and sanitation had no time to prepare.</p>
      <p>"When I took this job, I thought...well, everyone already knows when snow is coming," Garcia said. "And then I got into this job, and actually, really, they don't."</p>
      <p>Twelve months ago, a gently sloping West Side Highway on-ramp became an impassible ice rink. And it turns out, critical links like it make up 300 miles of roadway across the five boroughs.</p>
      <p>And a year later, the city says it has a new plan to keep them moving.</p>
      <p>"The ramps really struggled, and we wanted to see if we can put down more product ahead to hold those from freezing longer," Garcia said.</p>
      <p>So the city has invested in 20 trucks to spray a layer of brine on all those ramps well in advance of the slightest chance of snow.</p>
      <p>They're also working more closely with police to close any ramps that shows signs of early icing. But with all her team's preparation comes a plea -- to you.</p>
      <p>"With climate change and storms that are unpredictable, we need the public to be paying attention," Garcia said.</p>
      <p>They've prepared as much as they can. But so should you.</p>
