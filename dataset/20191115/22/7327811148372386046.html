      <p>LONG BRANCH, New Jersey (WABC) -- A New Jersey teenager who allegedly shot and killed his parents, sister and a family friend on New Year's Eve in 2017 will stand trial in adult court.</p>
      <p>Monmouth County prosecutors made the announcement Friday.</p>
      <p>Scott Kologi faces four counts of first-degree murder and a weapons charge.</p>
      <p>He was 16 when the shootings occurred in his family's Long Branch home on New Year's Eve two years ago.</p>
      <p>Members of the Long Branch and West Long Branch police departments responded to a report of a shooting at a home on Wall Street just before midnight. Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have said the semi-automatic rifle used in the killings was legally owned by someone in the home.</p>
      <p>The teen's brother and grandfather and another friend were in the house at the time of the shooting but escaped unharmed.</p>
      <p>Kologi's first appearance in court will be at a detention hearing scheduled for November 20, in Monmouth County Superior Court.</p>
      <p>He would face 30 years to life without parole in a New Jersey state prison if convicted of murder and would face 5 to 10 years in prison if convicted of the second-degree crime.</p>
      <p>Kologi, now 18, remains jailed in a youth detention center.</p>
