      <p><b>Nicolas Cage </b>is looking to take on a movie role that his whole career has been leading up to. The iconic actor is in final negotiations to play himself in an upcoming meta drama titled <b><i>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</i></b>.</p>
      <p>If Cage actually signs on to star in the film, he will play actor Nicolas Cage a character who “is desperate to get a role in a new Tarantino movie while also dealing with a strained relationship with his teenage daughter. He also occasionally talks to an egotistical 1990s version of himself who rides him for making too many crappy movies and for not being a star anymore.”</p>
      <p>It’s explained that Cage’s character is also “under a mountain of debt and finds himself forced to make an appearance at the birthday party of a Mexican billionaire who happens to be a fan of Cage’s work and secretly hopes to show him a script on which he’s been working.”</p>
      <p>The story gets even better, “while he bonds with the man, Cage is informed by the CIA that the billionaire is actually a drug cartel kingpin who has kidnapped the daughter of a Mexican presidential nominee, and is recruited by the U.S. government to get intelligence. The situation spirals even more dramatically when the Mexican brings over Cage’s daughter and his ex-wife for a reconciliation, and when their lives are on the line, Cage takes on the role of a lifetime.”</p>
      <p>Nicolas Cage close the deal to star in this movie because it’s a movie that I have to see it! As you know, Cage has spent the last several years starring in a ton of low-budget films, one after another and they seem to get crazier and crazier. Well, this would be the ultimate Nic Cage movie!</p>
      <p>The film project is set up at Lionsgate and the script for it comes from <b>Tom Gormican</b> and <b>Kevin Etten</b>, with Gormican attached to direct. </p>
      <p>According to<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nicolas-cage-star-as-nicolas-cage-unbearable-weight-massive-talent-1254626"> THR</a>, “the script was shown to Cage accompanied with a letter that Gormican wrote, pleading his case and saying how the piece was a love letter to the actor, not something that made fun of him. Cage was convinced and became attached only in recent weeks.”</p>
      <p>This is gonna be the great Nicolas Cage film of all time!</p>
