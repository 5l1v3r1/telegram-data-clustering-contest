      <p>A senior Israeli official said on Friday that Israel did not promise to the Islamic Jihad that it would stop the policy of targeted eliminations of terrorist leaders.</p>
      <p>“We didn't promise anyone that we would avoid eliminations. Whoever tries to fire or does fire - will get it," the senior official clarified. "Contrary to how it was presented - Islamic Jihad is the one that turned to Egypt [to broker a ceasefire]. It presented conditions - but that has no significance."</p>
      <p>The calm in southern Israel has been maintained since Friday morning, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%91%D7%A8%20%D7%9E%D7%93%22%D7%90,%20%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%A8,%20%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%99%D7%97%D7%A1%20%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A2%20%D7%91%D7%95%20%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A1%20%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%91%20%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%A1%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%A1%20%D7%A9%D7%9C%20%D7%9E%D7%93%22%D7%90:%20%22%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%9E%D7%93%22%D7%90%20%D7%94%D7%92%D7%99%D7%A9%20%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94%20%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%94%20%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%94%22.%20%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%9B%D7%B4%D7%9C%20%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%B4%D7%90,%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%20%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9F,%20%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8:%20%D7%B4%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%A2%20%D7%90%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A9%D7%A2%20%D7%95%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%97%D7%94%20%D7%94%D7%96%D7%94%20%D7%99%D7%93%D7%A2%20%D7%91%D7%93%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A7%20%D7%90%D7%AA%20%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%95%20%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%99%D7%97%D7%A1%20%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%9A%20%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%90%20%D7%94%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%91%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%A1%20%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA%22">after Red Color sirens were heard</a> in the Sderot area and the Shaar Hanegev Regional Council the night before. Two rockets that were launched from Gaza toward Israeli territory were intercepted by the Iron Dome system.</p>
      <p>Overnight Thursday, IDF fighter jets and aircraft <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271703">attacked a military compound</a> that was used, among other things, as a site for the production of components used to make rockets.</p>
      <p>In addition, the headquarters of the terrorist organization’s Khan Yunis division, which houses the offices of several Islamic commanders, was attacked.</p>
