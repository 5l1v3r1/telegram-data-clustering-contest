      <h1>Nicolas Cage to play Nicolas Cage in movie about Nicolas Cage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:46:40+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:46</time> by <a rel="author">Lauren Steussy</a></address>
      <p>This checks out.</p>
      <p>Nicolas Cage is “in talks” to play himself in a new meta drama about Nicolas Cage. He would be the star, crucially, and the movie would pay homage to the likes of “Leaving Las Vegas,” “Face/Off” and “Gone in 60 Seconds,” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nicolas-cage-star-as-nicolas-cage-unbearable-weight-massive-talent-1254626">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
      <p>Cage, 55, will also co-produce the piece of cinema titled “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unbearable-Lightness-Being-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061148520/ref=sr_1_1?tag=nypost-20">like a Milan Kundera novel</a> — only cagier.</p>
      <p>The script, co-written by <a href="https://dailydead.com/comic-con-2017-interview-ghosted-executive-producers-tom-gormican-and-kevin-etten-on-their-upcoming-supernatural-comedy/">Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten</a>, has a Cage-esque array of twists and turns. According to the industry outlet, the main character, Nicolas Cage, is at his wit’s end trying to land a role in the latest Tarantino flick, while attempting to patch things up with his teenage daughter and overcome mountains of debt. (<a href="https://nypost.com/2011/04/15/nicolas-cage-targeted-by-irs-for-alleged-unpaid-gift-taxes/">Sound familiar?</a>)</p>
      <p>The fictional Cage is constantly having internal conversations with a ’90s movie star version of himself, who ridicules his flailing film career.</p>
      <p>Things start to turn up when he meets a billionaire from Mexico, who’s a fan of his stuff and has some projects he wants to talk to Cage about. But, in a “National Treasure”-like twist, the CIA informs Cage that the billionaire is a drug kingpin, and they’d like Cage’s help trying to bust him. </p>
      <p>When the billionaire brings his wife and daughter into the picture, well, that’s when Cage is up against the role of his life.</p>
      <p>The trades report that the movie will have “tones of ‘Adaptation’ . . . Jean-Claude Van Damme’s meta movie ‘JCVD,’ and the John Travolta Hollywood caper ‘Get Shorty,’ among others.”</p>
      <p>Lionsgate reportedly waged a bidding war with HBO Max and Paramount to score the film, which doesn’t yet have a premiere date. Gormican will direct and Kevin Turen, an executive producer on <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/30/hbos-euphoria-is-just-trolling-us-with-penis-outrage-now/">HBO’s controversial “Euphoria</a>,” will produce with Cage’s production company, Saturn Films, and Mike Nilon of “Left Behind” fame.</p>
      <p>The script was developed without the Oscar-winning cult film icon’s knowledge, but Gormican sent it to Cage with a note pleading with him to be in it. He wrote that the film was a “love letter to the actor, not something that made fun of him.” In the last couple of weeks, the “Wild at Heart” star came around to playing himself.</p>
      <p>It helps, of course, that the pay could help put him back in the green after some <a href="https://pagesix.com/2014/04/15/5-celebs-who-have-cheated-uncle-sam/?_ga=2.24655610.175416609.1572813152-1908335273.1555278314">high-profile tax troubles</a>, comparable to the days when he was banking major studio checks for blockbusters and classics such as “The Rock,” “Moonstruck,” “Raising Arizona,” “Con Air” and “Peggy Sue Got Married.”</p>
