      <p>Lionel Messi praised Argentina’s work ethic after scoring the winner on his return to international football as Brazil were beaten 1-0 in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old was banned for three months by CONMEBOL after criticising the South American governing body during this summer’s Copa America, both after a semi-final loss to Brazil and a third-place play-off win over Chile in which he was sent off following an altercation with Gary Medel.</p>
      <p>However, the Barcelona forward made a triumphant return as he scored the only goal of the game in an international friendly in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>“At the beginning we tried to play, we made a few mistakes and they created some chances,” Messi told the Argentinean FA’s official website.</p>
      <p>“In the second half we improved a lot.</p>
      <p>“I think this system defensively gives us a lot. It’s good that we can play in several ways.</p>
      <p>“When you win, you work with peace of mind, it is very positive for what is coming.</p>
      <p>“We all ran a lot – it’s what we had to do.”</p>
      <p>Gabriel Jesus hit a tame effort straight at Esteban Andrada after seven minutes, but moments later earned a penalty when he was fouled by Leandro Paredes in the area.</p>
      <p>The Manchester City striker took the spot-kick, only to fire wide from 12 yards in the 10th minute.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later Argentina were awarded a penalty of their own when Messi was tripped by Alex Sandro.</p>
      <p>Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker saved Messi’s spot-kick, but the Barcelona forward was left with a simple task to tap in the rebound.</p>
      <p>Messi could have doubled his tally a minute before half-time when he burst clear of the Brazil defence, but Alisson stood firm to save his low effort.</p>
      <p>Jesus and Willian both failed to work Andrada as Brazil sought an equaliser after the break, while at the other end Messi’s 66th-minute free-kick had to be tipped over by Alisson.</p>
      <p>Lautaro Martinez and Nicolas Otamendi both wasted late chances to make the game safe for Argentina, whose win represented a first against their arch rivals for more than two years.</p>
      <p>Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni added: “I liked the second half.</p>
      <p>“We made changes because we wanted to prepare for the tests that are coming.</p>
      <p>“The team responded and played really well.”</p>
      <p>Brazil coach Tite felt the game’s deciding spot-kick should not have been awarded.</p>
      <p>He told Brazilian media outlet Globo Esporte: “I did not see clearly, I know there were comments that it was not a penalty. For me it was not a penalty.”</p>
