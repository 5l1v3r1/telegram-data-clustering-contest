      <p>SURREY, B.C. - The mayor of Surrey, B.C., says he's deeply concerned about "mob violence" happening in his city after a video circulated online that shows a group of young men fighting and damaging a vehicle.</p>
      <p>A statement from Doug McCallum says it's the second such video that has been circulated online since August capturing people brawling and it's imperative that RCMP take immediate action.</p>
      <p>Mounties also issued a statement Friday confirming they have been investigating the video since Monday when police received two reports related to an assault with a weapon and vandalism to property in a city parking lot.</p>
      <p>Police say their investigation expanded since police received a copy of a video on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Cpl. Elenore Sturko says while the incident and video are disturbing, the video's wide distribution could potentially help police further their investigation and identify those involved.</p>
      <p>The dark video shows many people carrying wooden or metal weapons and using them to smash a vehicle and assault the driver who stepped out to confront the crowd.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 15, 2019.</p>
