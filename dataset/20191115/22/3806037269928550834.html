      <p>One month after serving up <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/jhene-aiko-triggered-remix-21-savage-summer-walker-stream">two remixes</a> of her May release <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/jhene-aiko-triggered-freestyle-stream-music-video">“Triggered,”</a> <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/jhene-aiko">Jhene Aiko</a> is unveiling a new single and its accompanying visual. For her latest track, the popular singer is reuniting with <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/big-sean">Big Sean</a> for a Fisticuffs-produced song titled “None of Your Concern.” The pairing’s latest collaborative effort — and ninth time working together on the same record — touches upon their past relationship, with both artists digging deep and using the single’s lyrics to reveal some of the more personal, intimate happenings from that period of their lives.</p>
      <p>“Me and Sean are good. I’ve got tons of love from him,” Jhene Aiko shared via Instagram earlier this year, opening up about her current relationship with her ex-boyfriend Big Sean and the themes and narrative of her upcoming LP. “My next album is all freestyles where I touch on many subjects and relationships… past, present, and future. I know you all love the drama and would like to think everything I do or say is about him, but I’ve been through plenty of other things and situations that I pull inspiration from when I sit down to create a song.”</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, Big Sean teamed up with BAPE to introduce a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/bape-a-bathing-ape-big-sean-bape-heads-show-collection-release-info">new capsule collection</a>.</p>
