      <h1>Gloucester beaten by Toulouse in Champions Cup opener</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:53:58+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:53</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Scrum-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/joe-simpson/">Joe Simpson</a> scored two magnificent tries but it was <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/saracens-are-going-to-be-quite-like-a-bear-with-a-sore-head-we-have-to-match-that-johan-ackermann">not enough to get Gloucester’s European campaign off to a winning start</a> as they were beaten 25-20 by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse">Toulouse</a> in the Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>Simpson’s two first-half efforts temporarily took the wind out of French sails but Toulouse regrouped to dominate the second half by scoring 16 unanswered points and ran out deserved winners.</p>
      <p>Danny Cipriani converted both of Simpson’s tries and kicked two penalties to complete the scoring for Gloucester. Sebastien Bezy scored a try for Toulouse, which <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/thomas-ramos/">Thomas Ramos</a> converted as well as kicking four penalties, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/romain-ntamack/">Romain Ntamack</a> kicking another penalty and Zack Holmes adding a drop goal.</p>
      <p>A knock-on from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester">Gloucester</a> wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/tom-marshall/">Tom Marshall</a> surrendered early possession and the visitors took advantage to take the lead with a neat drop goal from Holmes. Toulouse continued to have the better of the opening exchanges but, against the run of play, the hosts scored a brilliant opening try.</p>
      <p>From just outside their 22, Gloucester nicked a lineout for Simpson to burst away and inter-pass with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/matt-banahan/">Matt Banahan</a> before the scrum-half ran 55 metres to just hold off the tackle of Ramos and crash over.</p>

      <p>Ten minutes later, Simpson scored an even better one. Clever play from international three-quarters <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/yoann-huget/">Yoann Huget</a> and Ntamack had taken the French menacingly into the home 22 but the visitors lost possession for Simpson to pick up and run fully 80 metres for a superb score.</p>
      <p>Toulouse were stunned but still continued to dominate territory and possession and were rewarded with a penalty from Ramos. He then kicked another penalty but Cipriani succeeded with two to give Gloucester a 20-9 lead at the end of a breathtaking first half.</p>
      <p>Toulouse brought on <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> international lock <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/richie-gray/">Richie Gray</a> and withdrew outside half Holmes at the interval and the changes paid immediate dividends when Ntamack and Ramos both kicked penalties to reduce the deficit.</p>

      <p>The French dominated the third quarter as they penned the hosts in their own half but despite some excellent ball-handling skills, they were unable to break down a stubborn Gloucester defence and remarkably the home side still held a 20-15 lead going into the final quarter.</p>
      <p>However, Gloucester had to crack against a fierce onslaught and Bezy was on hand to secure the crucial touchdown which Ramos converted to put his side into the lead for the first time.</p>
      <p>Mark Atkinson was then penalised for a late tackle and Ramos knocked over the resulting kick to complete Toulouse’s comeback.</p>
