      <h3>A Martensville man admits he was intoxicated when he caused a head-on collision near Warman that killed an 11-year-old girl.</h3>
      <p>In Saskatoon provincial court this week, Anthony McClelland pleaded guilty to three charges: impaired driving causing death and two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Sentencing has been adjourned until March. Defence lawyer George Green indicated it will be a joint submission â€” a sentence that both lawyers have agreed upon.</p>
      <p>On Dec. 21, 2018, McClelland crashed his truck into a truck carrying three people at the intersection of Highways 11 and 305. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/warman-crash-victim-remembered-as-a-beautiful-girl-with-so-much-zest-for-life-and-family">Sophie Mae Schnurr, 11, died in the crash</a> and two others were injured.</p>
      <p>McClelland <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/crime/martensville-man-charged-with-drunk-driving-in-crash-that-killed-11-year-old-girl-near-warman">was also charged with dangerous driving causing death</a> and bodily harm and driving with a blood-alcohol level over the legal limit causing death and bodily harm, but those charges were withdrawn after the impaired driving pleas were entered.</p>
