In Power Saving mode, the brightness can also be affected by the battery level of the phone.</p>
      <p>If everything is working well, you should never notice these changes in brightness, because your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111519_why-does-my-brightness-keep-changing-samsung-galaxy-s10&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s10-with-128gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-prism-prism-black%2F6323528.p%3FskuId%3D6323528">Galaxy S10</a> will adapt seamlessly to changing lighting conditions. That’s not always the case, though.</p>
      <p>Here’s a breakdown of why your brightness keeps changing, and how to fix it.</p>

      <h3>Understanding Adaptive Brightness on a <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111519_why-does-my-brightness-keep-changing-samsung-galaxy-s10&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s10-with-128gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-prism-prism-black%2F6323528.p%3FskuId%3D6323528">Samsung Galaxy S10</a></h3>
      <p>Adaptive Brightness isn’t quite the same as the “Auto brightness” feature that was available in older versions of the Android operating system.</p>
      <p>Adaptive Brightness uses artificial intelligence to monitor how you change the brightness of the phone in various lighting conditions, and then starts making those adjustments for you automatically. In other words, it learns the lighting level you like over time, and then changes the brightness for you.</p>
      <p>That means it takes a little time for Adaptive Brightness to get used to your preferences. To teach it, when ever you use the phone in a different lighting condition, pull down the Control Center and use the brightness slider to adjust the screen. With sufficient training, it should make those decisions for you.</p>

      <h3>How to turn off Adaptive Brightness on a <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111519_why-does-my-brightness-keep-changing-samsung-galaxy-s10&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s10-with-128gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-prism-prism-black%2F6323528.p%3FskuId%3D6323528">Galaxy S10</a> if you don’t like the feature</h3>
      <p>Make sure you give the Adaptive Brightness feature enough time to learn from you – ideally, a few weeks of manual brightness adjustments. If, after that, it’s still not working to your satisfaction, you might want to turn it off.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Start the Settings app.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Tap “Display.”</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> Turn off Adaptive Brightness by swiping its button to the left.</p>

      <h3>How to check if Power mode is affecting screen brightness, or turn the feature off</h3>
      <p>Your battery level might also be affecting screen brightness – if “Adaptive power saving” is on, the power mode (and screen brightness) can change throughout the day as the battery level drops.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Swipe down from the top of the screen to display the Control Center.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Tap and hold “Power mode” until the Power mode settings page appears.</p>
