      <p>Mel Giedroyc was urged to let the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/great-british-bake-off/">Great British Bake Off</a> ‘go’ during her presenting stint on Children In Need.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old presented the baking show for seven years alongside Sue Perkins, but they were replaced back in 2017 when the show moved from BBC One to Channel 4 – with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/noel-fielding/">Noel Fielding</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sandi-toksvig/">Sandi Toksvig</a> taking over.</p>
      <p>But, despite no longer being on the show, she couldn’t resist dusting off a string of her best baking puns after praising staff and customers of Greggs for raising over £1million for charity.</p>
      <p>‘Guys that is a lot of dough. See what I’ve done there? Dough? Because they make bread,’ she began.</p>
      <p>‘I’m on a roll now, these puns aren’t half-baked. The best thing since sliced bread.</p>
      <p>‘You won’t get batter than these, they’re a piece of cake to do.’</p>

      <p>However, co-host Graham Norton was having absolutely none of it, telling her in no uncertain terms: ‘Mel, stop! Mel, you’ve got to let Bake Off go.’</p>

      <p>A little harsh, hun.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the evening, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/children-in-need-host-ade-adepitan-apologises-for-technical-issues-as-child-violinist-cut-off-live-on-air-11165688/">fellow presenter Ade Adepitan was forced to apologise</a> to viewers watching on from home – as a young child was cut off live on air, just as he started playing the violin.</p>
      <p>Viewers watching from the capital saw the live feed, direct from the Royal Mail sorting office, cut short as the show cut to an advert and then back to the studio.</p>

      <p>Many were upset that a child playing the violin live on the segment was cut away from and his time in the spotlight ruined.</p>
      <p>‘We are experiencing technical problems in London,’ Ade confirmed. ‘So apologies for that.’</p>
      <p>He then joked: ‘Probably some wet leaves in the wi-fi or something.’</p>
      <p>The annual charity show is aiming to raise money tonight for disadvantaged children up and down the UK.</p>
      <p>Last year, they managed to raise more than £50million.</p>
