      <h1>Hindu Mahasabha wants Godse’s court statements in Madhya Pradesh school syllabus</h1>
      <h2>Members of the right-wing organisation observe Godse's death anniversary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:00:17+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Hindu Mahasabha on November 15 demanded that Nathuram Godse’s statements during the Mahatma Gandhi assassination trial be included in school curriculum in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
      <p>The right-wing organisation made the demand while observing Godse’s death anniversary here.</p>
      <p>Godse, who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi, was hanged at Ambala jail on November 15, 1949.</p>
      <p>Hindu Mahasabha members on November 16 gathered at its office here and performed ‘aarti’ of Godse and Narayan Apte, the co- conspirator who too was hanged for Gandhi’s assassination.</p>
      <p>Hindu Mahasabha national vice-president Jaiveer Bharadwaj said the organisation observed the death anniversary of two “leaders”, whose “contribution to Indian freedom struggle has been forgotten”, like every year.</p>
      <p>“We also submitted a memorandum, addressed to Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, and to the district administration. We have demanded inclusion of Godse’s statements, recorded during his trial, in school curriculum,” Mr. Bharadwaj said.</p>
      <p>Congress governments at the Centre did not disclose Godse’s court statements for 50 years, he alleged.</p>
      <p>On November 15, 2017, the Mahasabha had installed a bust of Godse at its Gwalior office after performing the ritual of ‘pran pratishtha’ (consecration).</p>
      <p>Following widespread outrage, the district administration confiscated the bust.</p>
      <p>“In the memorandum, we also demanded that the bust, seized by the district administration, be returned to us,” Mr. Bharadwaj said.</p>
      <p>The ruling Congress in Madhya Pradesh condemned the event. “The event glorified violence. This is condemnable.</p>
      <p>These people don’t believe in the Indian Constitution as Godse himself had filed a mercy petition before the British Queen despite the country having a Supreme Court,” said Bhupendra Gupta, vice president of state Congress Media Cell.</p>
