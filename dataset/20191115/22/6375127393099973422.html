      <h3>Whether due to peer pressure, a way of relief, or the belief of its health benefits, one thing is certain. Marijuana use for teens is at an all-time high. With medical marijuana gaining acclaim, the number is still expected to rise.</h3>

        <b>What is Cannabidiol (CBD)?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is a compound found in <a href="https://www.weekendgardener.net/best-weed-strains/"><i>Cannabis</i></a>. It accounts for 40% of the cannabis plant’s extracts. Recently, scientists are using CBD in their studies regarding anxiety, pain, reasoning, and movement disorders. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is also another compound produced by cannabis, which happens to be its psychoactive component. It’s what makes people get “high” when they consume cannabis.</p>
      <p>Unlike THC, you won’t get high when you partake CBD. CBD can treat other health problems, which include pain and anxiety. So far, studies say people with sleeping problems that partook CBD helped them get some sleep.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here Are the Benefits and Why Young Adults Use Marijuana.</b>
      </p>
      <p>   <b>1.  CBD Works Better than Over-the-Counter Drugs</b></p>
      <p>It has better results than over-the-counter medication. According to a survey by the Anxiety  Association of America, 40 million or 18% of most Americans have anxiety. They say they have panic attacks at least once a week. These people have tried over-the-counter drugs to help them relax, but many say they are ineffective. Some of these claim to have risky effects when taken.</p>
      <p>   <b>2.  CBD Helps You Sleep Better</b></p>
      <p>CBD is said to interact with receptors in the brain that controls the body’s sleep and waking cycles. The “sleeping” effect of CBD varies on the test subjects. So far, there are still no specific dosages and frequency of intake with regards to using CBD at the moment. According to an <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cbd-for-insomnia">article</a> in 2017, CBD also has the potential to treat excessive daytime sleepiness.</p>
      <p>According to Dr. Joseph Maroon, CBD has properties that could help some people sleep better. Dr. Maroon is a clinical professor and neurosurgeon at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He says CBD eases pain and anxiety to a person. These are two of the major reasons that make it harder for people to fall into slumber or stay asleep.</p>
      <p>CBD is not a treatment for insomnia, according to Dr. Maroon. He says it’s a natural alternative to calm people’s thoughts and make them sleep. It is safe to use even by children, pregnant women, even older people. It is also non-habit-forming.</p>
      <p>You can take CBD in various ways and forms if you are experiencing problems with sleeping. The dose of CBD and the time you take it will depend on several factors. It includes bodyweight, individual body chemistry, and the category of your sleeping troubles.</p>
      <p>   <b>3.  CBD Can Reduce Acne</b></p>
      <p>Acne is estimated to affect more than 9% of the worldwide population, making it the eighth-most widespread disease globally.  Acne is caused by a multitude of factors, including bacteria, underlying inflammation, genes, or an overproduction of an oily secretion called sebum by the skin’s sebaceous glands.</p>
      <p>One study found that a CBD and its derivative, CBD oil, helps treat acne due to its ability to control the production of oil by the sebaceous glands, and its anti-inflammatory properties. In the study, CBD displayed anti-inflammatory actions and hampered the activation of inflammatory cytokines, a “pro-acne” agent.</p>
      <p>Another study was conducted under different conditions and produced similar findings, concluding that CBD had remarkable anti-inflammation properties and may be an efficient way to treat acne, which teens are ever so mindful of.</p>
      <p>   <b>4.  CBD Aids In Weight Loss</b></p>
      <p>According to a study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, those who regularly some marijuana are less likely to be obese than those who don’t. 30,000 were put on a weight study for three years, and those who used marijuana gained fewer pounds. Other research concludes that those who use cannabis have smaller and trimmer waistlines than non-users, as well as lower bad cholesterol levels.</p>
      <p>Those who are on the overweight side of the spectrum may do well and grow their own cannabis, provided they live in places where cultivating their own marijuana is legal.</p>
      <p>   <b>5.  CBD Curbs Alcoholism</b></p>
      <p>CBD has the potential to help people cope with serious alcoholism issues, according to new research awaiting publication on the Frontiers in Pharmacology journal. The data offers a promising outlook on the usage of marijuana as a deterrent to alcohol use disorders.</p>
      <p>The authors noted that CBD appeared to facilitate the reduction of alcohol drinking, and also provides peculiar protection to the liver and brain, which may help reduce the formation and impact of alcohol-related liver and brain diseases, damages, and injuries.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Side Effects of Using Marijuana as a Young Adult</b>
      </p>
      <p>Side effects are mostly uncommon to young adults who use CBD. But here are a few outcomes that you might experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change in appetite</li>
        <li>Change in weight</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although they are generally safe, CBD may also react with the medicine you are currently taking. Never forget to make use of high-quality CBD products only. As of now, Marijuana-derived CBD products are still illegal to some states. The FDA doesn't also regulate CBD, so you have to be careful in purchasing them.</p>
