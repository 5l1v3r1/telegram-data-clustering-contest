      <p>Yes, the people - or at least some people - still want foldables</p>

      <p>The first wave of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-mate-x"><u>Huawei Mate X</u></a> foldable phones has finally gone on sale in China - and the initial batch (of an uncertain amount) reportedly sold out in minutes, according to the <u>BBC</u>. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/foldable-phones">foldable phone</a> was introduced at MWC 2019 back in February and originally slated to launch over the summer, then publicly delayed until September. TechRadar exclusively <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-mate-x-release-date-pushed-to-november-but-next-version-may-even-more-screens"><u>learned</u></a> in August that there was no possibility it would make that deadline, and would much more likely become available in November (and at the very least, before the end of 2019). </p>
      <p>That’s come to pass after Huawei officially <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-mate-x-released-in-china-could-a-global-release-date-be-near"><u>launched</u></a> the foldable in China back in October and asserted it would go on sale in November - which it has, with a pricetag of 16,999 yuan (£1,900, around $2,495 / AU$3,559). </p>
      <p>A second wave of devices (again an uncertain number) will go on sale in China on November 22. But there’s still no announced plan to bring the device to other regions. </p>

      <h4>A future for Huawei’s foldable?</h4>
      <p>Huawei delayed the Huawei Mate X months after the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-fold">Samsung Galaxy Fold</a> abandoned its April launch due to durability issues, though the former company didn’t give any reason to push back the Mate X - so it’s unclear if they ran into any similar reliability issues or just wanted to avoid sharing Samsung’s fate since the public’s trust in foldables had been shaken.</p>
      <p>Rather, the initial delay in June followed the US’ <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-ban"><u>Huawei ban</u></a>. Since that hasn’t been repealed, only temporarily <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-us-ban-set-for-90-day-reprieve"><u>reprieved</u></a> in August that’s set to expire today, there’s no plan for the Mate X to come to the United States. </p>
      <p>Huawei maintains that the Mate X will be coming to other countries than China at some point, per the BBC. In any case, the company has allegedly already <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-huawei-mate-x-hasnt-even-landed-yet-but-huawei-has-unveiled-its-successor"><u>revealed</u></a> a successor, the Huawei Mate Xs, which will pack the latest Kirin 990 chip (it’s unclear when this will launch). </p>
