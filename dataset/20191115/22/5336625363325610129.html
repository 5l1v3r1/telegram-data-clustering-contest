      <h1>Weird, this 10-year-old's Christmas list is exactly the same as mine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:02:28+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/chloe-bryan/" target="_blank">Chloe Bryan</a></address>
      <p>You're probably not going to get everything on your Christmas list, you might as well shoot for the stars. </p>
      <p>Not sure where to start? Take notes from this 10-year-old, whose Christmas list is the most luxurious list of items ever compiled.</p>
      <p>The girl's dad, clearly awestruck by his child's knowledge of luxury goods, tweeted the list on Wednesday. "My 10 year old daughter must be out of her mind with this Christmas list," he wrote.</p>

      <p>It is, in a word, inspiring. On the list are new shoes (practical!), a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hydro-flask-review-vsco-girls/">Hydro Flask</a> (trendy!), and an alarm clock (useful!), but she <i>also </i>asks for Gucci slides, a Chanel bag, an iPhone 11, a "real Bunny" as well as clothes for the bunny, and — my personal favorite — four thousand dollars. </p>
      <p>Take a look and tag yourself. I am "AirPods" with  "laundry detergent" rising. Also, I am printing out this tweet and using it as my own Christmas list this year.</p>
