      <h1>Why Newcastle United can cope with losing skipper Jamaal Lascelles to injury</h1>
      <h2>The Magpies' captain is out until the new year, but those stepping up have shown their class in recent weeks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Malcolm Macdonald</a></address>
      <p>When a football club loses its skipper for the rest of the year it's normally a huge blow.</p>
      <p>However with respect to Jamaal Lascelles if Newcastle United had to be robbed of a senior player for a long while it was best that it was a central defender.</p>
      <p>Because United are so well off at the back.</p>
      <p>Think of it, Ciaran Clark, Federico Fernandez and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/paul-dummett">Paul Dummett</a> - none automatic selections - have come in recently and all have been absolutely outstanding.</p>
      <p>And two quality performers in Fabian Schar and Florian Lejeune are just about to return from injury so United can stand the absence of Lascelles.</p>
      <p>To be truthful I haven't been all that impressed with him this season.</p>
      <p>Oh, he looks the part. A true athlete and an elegant runner. But he's been nervy and uncomfortable at times.</p>
      <p>I've always liked Dummett, comparing him to my old team-mate Frank Clark in terms of being an out-and-out defender, while Ciaran Clark and Fernandez have waited patiently causing no fuss and really taken their belated opportunity.</p>

      <p>For me Clark has never let United down. I suggested recently that he could actually play as an emergency centre-forward because he would cause more trouble in the opposing penalty area than Joelinton - and what does he do? Score the winner against Bournemouth to become United's joint top scorer!</p>
      <p>International fortnight has disrupted <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">United's</a> run of form but I have to admit that it had me sweating on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Why? Because I could see my England record being broken.</p>
      <p>At half-time I was really worried. Montenegro were absolutely hopeless, England were five up, and Harry Kane had three of them.</p>
      <p>I felt there was a real chance that he would go on and equal or beat my Wembley record of scoring five goals in a competitive match for my country.</p>
      <p>We beat Cyprus 5-0 in a European qualifier, just like this was, on April 16, 1975 while I was with Newcastle and I scored all five playing alongside Kevin Keegan, Mike Channon, Alan Ball, Alan Hudson and Colin Bell.</p>

      <p>That record still stands but, unbelievably, Gareth Southgate took off Kane 12 minutes into the second half and I could breathe easily again.</p>
      <p>The only other time I've sweated on my England record was back in the early eighties when I was managing Fulham, though the game wasn't at Wembley so that half of my record was safe.</p>
      <p>England were playing in Spain and Gary Lineker scored one, then another, then another, and then another. He had four goals and there were still 25 minutes to go. But that was it and once again I survived.</p>

      <p>It was good to see <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/miguel-almiron">Miguel Almiron</a> score Paraguay's winner with a 25 yard piledriver. I only hope that reminded him that to win the lottery you have to buy a ticket. He doesn't take a chance with his shooting in Newcastle's colours.</p>
      <p>May his international goal and the manner of it rub off on him and inspire him to do the same at Aston Villa a week on Monday.</p>
