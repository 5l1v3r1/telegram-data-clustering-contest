      <p>Fans were treated to an up-close-and-personal performance by the music queen when the 51-year-old diva popstar crashed her own album release celebration at Lips Drag Queen Show Palace Restaurant and Bar in New York City on Thursday night.</p>

      <p>The Grammy-winning singer said she felt motivated recently to get back on the road and create music for the first time since the death of Angélil in 2016.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be the Celine that you know," she told The Associated Press of her album. "Celine at 51. The Celine that you know. The Celine with producers and writers she's worked with. It's the Celine with new producers and new songwriters. ... The sound will change a little bit, and music changes. But I will always remain who I am."</p>
