      <p>Posh champagne brands have beaten the budget chains’ bubbly in a Which? taste test.</p>
      <p>Piper Heidsieck, at £33, and Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label, at £35, both scored the top marks of 81 out of 100.</p>
      <p>Experts described the Piper Heidsieck as “decadent”, while the Veuve Clicquot was “fresh, fruity and slightly malty”.</p>
      <p>But a £20 bottle of Brut champagne from Waitrose was also voted a bubbly Best Buy, scored 80 for its “buttery baked goods” taste and “elegant lengthy finish”.</p>
      <p>An £11.49 bottle of Comte de Senneval from Lidl scored 77 and won praise for its “touch of apple strudel”. Tesco’s Finest Prosecco, at £8, was top sparkling wine, scoring 76 for its “fruity and floral notes”.</p>
      <p>Freixenet Cordon Negro, £11, was top Cava, scoring 75.</p>
      <p>Asda’s Extra Special Selection Cremant de Loire, £8, and Aldi’s English fizz, Angel and Four Masterstroke, at £10 scored 74 and 70 respectively.</p>
      <p>Harry Rose of Which? said: “Our experts have taken the guesswork out of choosing the fizz that will make your Christmas celebrations really sparkle.”</p>
