          <b><a href="http://insider.com/category/netflix">Netflix’s</a> animated movie “<a href="http://insider.com/category/klaus">Klaus</a>” is now available to stream.</b>

          <b>There’s a moment early on where a character calls a boy named Kristoff ugly for no apparent reason.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Some may think it’s a knock at Disney or “<a href="http://insider.com/category/disney">Frozen</a>.” One of the main characters in the franchise shares the same name and Disney has a sequel to the movie out next week.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Director Sergio Pablos told Insider that’s not the case. The character names were in the film’s first draft before 2013’s “Frozen” ever came out.</b>

        <li>
          <b>They considered changing the name of Olaf, but since the name is never said aloud in the movie and only appears in the credits, it was left in.</b>

      <p>If you tune into watch <a href="http://insider.com/category/netflix">Netflix’s</a> first <a href="https://www.insider.com/klaus-netflix-movie-review-2019-11">full-length original animated movie “Klaus”</a> this weekend, you may hear a few familiar names that may make you pause.</p>
      <p>Thirty-four minutes into the film postman Jesper (played by Jason Schwartzman) reads a letter from a child he offhandedly refers to as “little, ugly Kristoff.” Later in the film, there’s another character named Sven. Director Sergio Pablos also voices a character named Olaf. All three are names of main characters from “Frozen.”</p>

      <p>This moment may take you out of the movie for a second if you’re a big “Frozen” fan and make you wonder if Netflix just made a knock at Disney.</p>

      <p>Despite the similarities, Pablos, who used to animate for Disney, tells Insider they’re not making a joke about “Frozen.”</p>
      <p>“Actually no,” Pablos told Insider. “‘Frozen’ came out after we had written the first draft. Those characters were already named.”</p>

      <p>Pablos first started working on the story about a spoiled postman befriending a toy man back in 2010. Disney’s “Frozen” came out three years later in 2013 and, at the time, became the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-frozen-is-a-huge-success-2014-4">highest-grossing animated movie of all time</a>.</p>
      <p>Since then, the names Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf became household names by children and adults alike. It’s something Pablos considered while working on “Klaus” after the global rights for the film <a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/breaking-netflix-will-produce-sergio-pablos-2d-feature-klaus-154767.html">were acquired in 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>“I actually proposed several times to change the name of Olaf to something else after ‘Frozen’ came out. We could easily call him a different thing,” said Pablos.</p>

      <p>“But the crew had grown accustomed to them so we ended up [leaving it]. No one ever pronounces his name on screen. I think it’s only credited, so we were like, ‘OK just leave it that way,'” he added.</p>

      <p>Though “Klaus” takes place in the far reaches of the North in the fictional town of Smeerensburg, it was based off of the landscape of Norway, Sweden. The film embraces Scandinavian culture and even includes a young girl who speaks Sámi.</p>
      <p>“If you do your basic search for Scandinavian names, those are the few that will pop up. So that’s pretty much what happened,” said Pablos of the three names appearing in “Klaus.” “But there is no attempt at a wink or anything like that.”</p>
      <p>“Klaus” is currently streaming on Netflix.</p>
