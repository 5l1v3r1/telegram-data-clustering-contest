      <p>Additional officers began searching the area for a 57-year-old man, according to the report. Contact was made with the man's family, who determined no one had heard from him since 2:30 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Dane County Sheriff's Office was brought in to provide a K-9 to assist with a track, police said.</p>
      <p>A ping of the man's phone was plotting near the area, officials said. A request was made for a drone with thermal imaging to assist in the search, which Madison police officers were able to provide.</p>
      <p>Police said the drone search began at approximately 3:25 a.m. The drone was able to pick up a thermal signature within 2 to 4 minutes, and officers found the man lying in a culvert at approximately 3:48 a.m.</p>
      <p>The man was found alive but incoherent, police said. He was taken to a hospital and was in critical condition.</p>
      <p>Authorities said it was determined that the man suffered a medically significant event and likely drove off the road, into the field, then wandered from his vehicle.</p>
      <p>Police said that as of Friday afternoon, there have been no indications of foul play.</p>
      <p>Sun Prairie police thanked the Dane County Sheriff's Office and Madison Police Department for their help in the case.</p>
      <p>"The thermal imaging drone was instrumental in finding this person alive," Sun Prairie police said in a statement. </p>
