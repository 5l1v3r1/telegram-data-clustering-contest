      <p>Physical gold demand climbed in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html">India</a> this week, with sellers charging premiums for the first time in five-and-a-half months as jewellers took advantage of a price dip and lower imports squeezed supply.</p>
      <p>Dealers charged a premium of up to $1.50 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, compared with discounts of up to two dollars an ounce last week. The domestic price includes a 12.5 percent import tax and a 3 percent sales tax.</p>

      <p>Gold futures were trading around 37,978 rupees per 10 grams on Friday, down from a record 39,885 rupees touched in September.</p>
      <p>India's gold imports in October fell a third from a year earlier, dropping a fourth straight month.</p>
      <p>"Anticipating a correction in prices, jewellers were not buying for the last few months. Now, they have to buy (to restock) after Diwali sales," said a Mumbai-based dealer with a bullion-importing bank.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Indians celebrated the Dhanteras and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2017/10/diwali-festival-lights-171019123017709.html">Diwali</a> festivals, when demand peaks.</p>
      <p>In top consumer <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/china.html">China</a>, premiums of $4 - $4.50 an ounce were quoted, little changed from last week's four - five-dollar mark-ups.</p>
      <p>"Demand in Shanghai is getting pressured because the economy is not doing well. People do not have enough money to buy the expensive metal," said Samson Li, a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/hong-kong.html">Hong Kong</a>-based precious metals analyst at Refinitiv GFMS.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/singapore.html">Singapore</a> demand steadied after a dip in global benchmark prices, which have fallen over seven percent from a six-year high of $1,557 an ounce hit in early September.</p>
      <p>In Hong Kong, gold was sold at a premium of $0.30-$0.50 an ounce versus $0.40-$0.50 last week. Violent <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/hong-kong-protests.html">protests</a> in the financial hub have deterred buyers recently.</p>
      <p>"Demand in Hong Kong is steady as spot prices fell, but that is being offset by the protests as people are not shopping - not only jewellery but anything for that matter," said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals.</p>
      <p>Sellers in Singapore charged premiums of $0.50-$0.60 an ounce over the benchmark, versus $0.50-$0.80 last week.</p>
      <p>"While physical gold demand is not at the high levels we saw between July and September, we're still seeing a good volume purchased by clients who see the current price dip as a buying opportunity," Silver Bullion sales manager Vincent Tie said.</p>
      <p>Japanese sellers saw demand improve after prices fell below $1,450 an ounce, a Tokyo-based trader said, with a premium, of about $0.50 an ounce, being charged for the first time since early June.</p>
