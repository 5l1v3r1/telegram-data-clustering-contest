      <h1>Trico Homes is 'a community leader,' says new president</h1>

      <p>After playing a lead role in the revitalization of East Village, Michael Brown is moving into the president’s chair of one of Calgary’s veteran home builders.</p>
      <p>Following the retirement of Trico Homes’ current president, Tom Chisholm, Brown will take over the role starting in January 2020. The builder is presently active in 24 communities in the Calgary area.</p>
      <p>“It was one of those opportunities — their value system, my value system, who they are as a company, who I want to be — that really aligned,” says Brown, on the role with Trico.</p>
      <p>For the past eight years, Brown was president and CEO of Calgary Municipal Land Corp.</p>
      <p>This wholly-owned subsidiary of the City of Calgary was incorporated in 2007 to spearhead the Rivers District Community Revitalization Plan, which includes East Village.</p>
      <p>On what Brown is most proud of about his time with CMLC, he points to the team.</p>
      <p>“You have this collection of folks that came together, different backgrounds, different personalities and together, I think we definitely proved as an organization that one plus one equals three,” Brown says.</p>
      <p>“The opportunity to work on things like the Simmons Building, the new (Central Library) that was built, as well as some of the programming that has taken place,” he adds. “All of those things matter, but the team is really the thing that stands out the most to me.”</p>
      <p>In a prepared statement, Randy Magnussen, chair of the CMLC board, lauded Brown’s “expert ability to maintain a successful organizational dynamic.</p>
      <p>“He built a powerhouse team that is nimble, responsive, forward-thinking and innovative — and he inspired them to do great things.”</p>
      <p>In Trico, Brown was impressed with its success as not only a business, but a community builder, as well.</p>
      <p>“I believe Trico is a leader on that front,” he says. “They always put the community first. That was something that became very important to me. In meeting with them, it was really what attracted me to Trico.</p>
      <p>“It’s not as big of a shift as people might think because I’m moving from one community-building organization to another.”</p>
      <p>Trico builds both front-drive and laned single-family homes, and attached homes.</p>
      <p>Brown calls the builder a “very well-run organization.”</p>
      <p>“My focus is to come on board, learn as much as I can, and really maintain momentum,” he adds. “Trico, to me, is a community leader, it’s a leader in the industry, and with that, comes great responsibility. My job is to come in and ensure that we as a company continue to reach our potential.</p>
      <p>“I’m going into a very fortunate position. This is a company that’s in great shape. The team members that I’ve met are unbelievable — to take that and build off of it, it’s a perfect situation for me.”</p>
      <p>Trico is a certified B Corp. — which recognizes businesses for factors such as social and environment performance — and has been recognized as one of the Best Workplaces for Women, and one of the Best Workplaces for Giving Back by certification program Great Place to Work.</p>
      <p>Among the marks of a successful builder, says Brown, are the ability to respond to market demand, and quality customer service.</p>
      <p>“I still remember the time that I bought our home back in the early 2000s,” he says. “That personal touch, if you do it really well, it sets you apart, and if you have a negative experience, you don’t go back.</p>
      <p>“One of the things at Trico that I really like is that this is something it values as an organization. This is a value set that is already there.”</p>
      <p>Trico was founded in 1992 by CEO Wayne Chiu, who is now a Member of the Order of Canada.</p>
      <p>“I believe Michael will be a strong and thoughtful leader as well as a valued collaborator with our stakeholders,” says Chiu. “I look forward to an exciting and prosperous future for Trico Homes.”</p>
