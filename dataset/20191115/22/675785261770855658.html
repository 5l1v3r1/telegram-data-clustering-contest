      <p>Jeffrey Epstein planted drugs on one of his alleged rape victims seeing her sent to jail after she threatened to expose him, a court has been told.</p>
      <p>Model Juliette Bryant made the claim in a new lawsuit against the late pervert’s estate.</p>
      <p>The South African says she was asked by Epstein to send nude pictures only two months before he was arrested in July.</p>
      <p>Bryant said she was an aspiring 20-year-old model when she was first introduced to the financier.</p>
      <p>In her lawsuit, filed in New York, she claims he would go on to forcibly rape her across the world.</p>

      <p>Bryant, now 37, says she was introduced to Epstein, who was described to her as the “King of America”, in 2002 in Cape Town.</p>
      <p>“Instead of fulfilling her dreams of becoming a model in New York, she was subject to extreme and repeated sexual abuse,” the claim says of her alleged two-year ordeal.</p>
      <p>“The very first time Epstein brought Juliette to the US, in order to scare her, he told her that when another woman had accused him of rape, he planted drugs in her apartment and had her sent to prison.”</p>
      <p>Epstein’s estate has said it intends to set up a compensation fund for accusers.</p>
      <p>Lawyers were not available for comment.</p>
