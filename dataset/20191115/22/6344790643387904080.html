      <p>Asmodee Digital has released a new trailer called “Munchking of Disco” for their upcoming title <b><i>Munchkin: Quacked Quest</i></b>. This trailer really makes me want to grab this game as it adds to how ridiculous this game looks. In the trailer, we see some more gameplay, and more importantly, we see the rave reviews that several Ducks have given it. Duck Nukem said, “Started a 4-player game and now I need new friends.” I don’t want to ruin what other Ducks have said about the game, but it’s worth watching the trailer.</p>
      <blockquote>Dive into Munchkin: Quacked Quest and re-discover the parody, puns, and humor from the hit card game Munchkin, tailored for four players couch-coop adventures. The mix between accessible, yet rich, gameplay and a leveling race offers intense &amp; skill-based brawling action. Gather gold, throw your foes (and friends) into sacrifice pits, collect ducks, eliminate the monsters—from the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime to the mighty Plutonium Dragon—and reach the highest level to win the game! After all, there’s only one spot at the top and you just found a chainsaw…</blockquote>
      <p><i>Munchkin: Quacked Quest</i> is will release on November 19 for Nintendo Switch, PC (via Steam), PS4, and Xbox One. If you pre-order the game, you will get a 15% discount as well.</p>
