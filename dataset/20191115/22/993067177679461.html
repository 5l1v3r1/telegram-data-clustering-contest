      <p>BBC Children In Need host Ade Adepitan apologised after the fundraiser’s broadcast was hit by technical difficulties.</p>
      <p>The presenter, who co-hosted the event with Tess Daly from Elstree Studios, issued an apology after a live segment from London went awry.</p>
      <p>Broadcasting from the The Postal Museum in London, BBC London presenter Riz Lateef’s interview with a boy, who had begun to play his violin, was cut short.</p>

      <p>“We are experiencing technical problems in London so apologies for that,” Adepitan said.</p>
      <p>The wheelchair basketball player and host jokingly added: “Probably some wet leaves in the WiFi or something.”</p>
      <p>The issue on the London broadcast did not affect the general network transmission.</p>
      <p>Later in the evening, Rylan Clark-Neal appeared on stage so Graham Norton could announce the total he raised by singing non-stop karaoke for 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The presenter took on a total of 236 songs during his so-called Great Ka-RY-oke Challenge earlier this week, assisted by celebrities including Nicole Scherzinger, Craig David and Rick Astley.</p>

      <p>However, when Norton announced the total of £1,086,261, another total – £2,005,827 – appeared behind him.</p>
      <p>That total was the amount raised by BBC Radio 2, which included Clark-Neal’s amount.</p>
      <p>After, Norton joked: “We are on it. We are on it. We know what we are doing.”</p>
      <p>This year Children In Need raised a total of £35,383,512 in just the first two-and-a-half hours, with donations still rolling in.</p>
      <p>The BBC has been contacted for comment.</p>
