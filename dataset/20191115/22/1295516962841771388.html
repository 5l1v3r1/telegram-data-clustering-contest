      <p>In the world of the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> show <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/see/"><i>See</i></a>, humanity has been without a sense of sight for centuries. While the series hired numerous blind and low-vision actors to bring this very specific conception of the future to life, the leads, including Jason Momoa (<i>Aquaman</i>) and Alfre Woodard (<i>Luke Cage</i>), are not blind. As a result, they had to go through rigorous training to capture the experience of living on an Earth where vision has become nothing more than a myth.</p>
      <p>At a recent press conferences and series of round tables, the show's cast and producers went into detail about the training and other considerations that went into making <i>See</i> as realistic as possible, while still ensuring it would offer plenty of visual delight to its audience.</p>
      <p>The process started with a great deal of discussion and training. As Hera Hilmar (<i>DaVinci's Demons</i>), who plays Maghra on the series, explained, “We went through the steps of first consciously speaking about [blindness], intellectually understanding it…. [blindness consultant] Joe [Strechay] would help us with… the skills that people who are blind use so we could physically learn that. So we had a long time where we went from that stage until we practiced it so much that it became a natural thing for us to do.”</p>

      <p>Yadira Guevara-Prip (<i>Supernatural</i>), who portrays Bow Lion, also said there were discussions about the way our reliance on sight is reflected in our language. “There were lots of conversations about how… language changes because so much of our language is embedded through the funnel of vision. People say things like ‘I see what you’re saying.’ It’s so deeply in our language because we are such visual creatures.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, blindness consultant Strechay spoke to the importance of eliminating social gestures like nodding, eye contact, and anticipating objects in the show. “…eye contact is a social norm as well as evolutionary. Cultures have built it in….,” he explained. “And in a world where there hasn’t been vision for many centuries... that eye contact norm will disappear.”</p>
      <p>However, Archie Madekwe (<i>Midsommar</i>), who plays the miraculously sighted teenager Kofun, clarified that the goal of the actors’ training wasn’t to be able to function as a blind person. “It’s important to say that we were never learning to be blind,” he noted. “[Strechay] was teaching us a set of skills that people that are blind use to function day to day and the skill sets that they have that we were then able to take on to help enabled people to perform as blind.”</p>
      <p>By the time cameras rolled, the actors were prepared to fully embody their blind characters. However, they discovered that the lack of sight led them to spend more time considering aspects of their performance that they typically would pay less attention to. “I think sometimes when you rely on vision you’re always thinking about eye contact or whatever but when you strip that away you start to think about how you really communicate physically….” Hilmar noted. “…you express yourself differently because nobody’s going to be looking at you. I thought that was very freeing as an actor to play with that…”</p>

      <p>Momoa also said playing someone who is blind “changed my whole performance.” He emphasized that this not only changed the way he acted but also led to some extremely intimate moments. “I think it was the most detailed acting I’ve ever done.. Things from movement and how I… navigate....” He added, “Some of the most intimate moments I’ve had as an actor were done in this with all clothes on and no sex involved whatsoever, just straight-up intimacy of touch and feel and smell. And that was extremely beautiful.”</p>
      <p>However, Guevara-Prip spoke to the challenge of successfully conveying blindness on-screen. “It’s a strange thing to translate because film is such a visual medium,” she observed. “There’s also a preconception of what blindness looks like for those who are not familiar with the blind or low-vision community. I had preconceptions about how a blind person behaves or how they look and where their gaze is. And that was all challenged when I started to meet people who were actually blind and low-vision. So coming to the camera and looking like you are blind to an audience that has vision… it’s a funky puzzle.”</p>
      <p>Beyond the acting, every department on the series was challenged to create a world that supported a human population without vision. Executive producer Dan Shotz (<i>Black Sails</i>) explained that this led to the departments working much more closely than they typically do. “No one was ever done anything like this before so everybody was forced to come together.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sylvia Hoeks (<i>Blade Runner 2049</i>), who plays Queen Kane, and Christian Camargo (<i>Penny Dreadful</i>), who plays her head Witchfinder, Tamacti Jun, emphasized the way different elements of the show speak to its characters’ lack of sight. “The rings and the bells were all for sound, and flowers were for smell… It was all thought out… it shouldn’t be for the eye,” Hoeks explained. “That’s why we shaved our heads.”</p>
      <p>“And there was prayer in the scarification.” Camargo added. “So there was reminders of when you touch your scalp it’s a constant reminder of my [character’s] mission…. And all this stuff was not necessarily in the exposition of the piece but for us as the actors. When you see what we’re wearing and what’s on our faces it’s all based in a world of being blind, so what it feels like. For the creative department it was a huge challenge to make a show with a story that contains blindness within it but also to make it visually appealing to those who can see… So everything had to have purpose and messaging and, yet at the same time, have that aesthetic.”</p>

      <p>The cast and filmmakers were quick to emphasize that although the people who inhabit the world of<i> See</i> are blind, that's only one aspect of their lives. As Marilee Talkington (<i>New Amsterdam</i>), who plays Souter Bax explained, “Blindness is just the foundational baseline -- and then you have the human experience and all this craziness.”</p>
      <p>Executive producer Shotz concurred. “We didn’t want these characters to be defined by their disability. We wanted these characters to be defined by their will to survive, their passion, their heroism. And so we had to figure out how to tell the story, and it was tricky. But it was listening to people like [Strechay] that made the difference”</p>
      <p>The filmmakers also expressed hope that <i>See</i> would be the first of many shows that portrays disability as just another part of life. “We know we’re only the beginning,” noted executive producer Shotz. “This show is taking steps to make a difference. The difference that needs to be made is massive. And [we hope <i>See</i>] can be the beginning of that dialogue, the beginning of the conversation to start making this change about how we view people with disabilities…”</p>
