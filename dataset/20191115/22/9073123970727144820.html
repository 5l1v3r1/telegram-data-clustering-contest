      <h1>Which mobility item should Epic add to Fortnite Chapter 2?</h1>

        <b>Epic will almost certainly add more mobility items to Fortnite. Which is the first one that they’ll bring back, though?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fortnite Chapter 2 brought everything back to basics. The loot pool is meat and potatoes. Epic even removed most of the mobility options from the game, leaving us to run, swim, and drive a boat.</p>
      <p>One thing we know about Fortnite is that it’s always going to change. Epic will add more mobility to Fortnite in the future – even if we have to wait until next season.</p>
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ahead, we’ll take a look at five of the most popular mobility tools from previous seasons and speculate as to which one could be coming first.</p>
      <h3>1. Launch Pads</h3>

        <img src="https://fortniteintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Launch_Pad.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Launch Pads are probably everyone’s number-one pick for the first mobility item to return to Fortnite. It’s the old classic and was the first mobility item Epic added for Chapter 1.</p>
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Chances are, we haven’t seen the last of your old friend, the Launch Pad. Most players would be happy to see this one return. There are very few downsides to adding the Launch Pad back into Fortnite.</p>
      <h3>2. Bouncers</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Bouncers are a strong contender for the first mobility option as well. They don’t send you too far but are a great way to avoid fall damage if you build up too high.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bouncers also provide a way to make creative plays in a Fortnite match; whether you’re taking the high ground, bouncing a player into the storm, or landing a trickshot.</p>
      <h3>3. Impulse Grenades</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fortniteintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/impulse.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Impulse Grenades might be the most objectively fair mobility item if there’s no other mobility in Fortnite. They serve as fantastic situational mobility but they don’t break through structures as the Shockwaves do.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You also have to worry about fall damage with Shockwaves, which adds a fun “meme” element to the game. Impulses are the only mobility items on this list that can actually kill an opponent.</p>
      <p>Impulses will be a tame mobility addition, but they’re better than nothing and fair when left on their own.</p>
      <h3>Shockwaves</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fortniteintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fortnite_patch-notes_v5-30-content-update_header-v5-30-content-update_BR05_News_Header_16_9_Shockwave-Grenade-1920x1080-ad3fbd7fb7ed83217dac7aad5bb11231726574b1-1024x576.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Shockwaves were king while they were in the game. They provide one of the safest and most consistent mobility options in Fortnite – especially if you throw them in your box correctly.</p>
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>On the other hand, they may be too powerful without Bouncers and Launch Pads to accompany them. Having Shockwaves in a late-game competitive match puts you at a huge advantage for rotating and taking high ground.</p>
      <h3>Grappler</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fortniteintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fortnite-battle-royal-bug-grappler.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Grappler is probably the least likely to come back to Fortnite Chapter 2 – at least as the first mobility solution. These would probably be too overpowered in the current state of Fortnite.</p>
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remember, we’re operating under the assumption that only one mobility item will be added. If Grapplers were on their own, they would be far too powerful compared to someone having no mobility at all.</p>
      <p>Which mobility item do you want to see come back to Fortnite? Is it one of these or something off of the list like the Rift-to-Go or Shadow Bomb? Let us know in the comments.</p>
