      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A group of conservative lawmakers in Ohio has introduced a bill to outlaw abortion outright except to save the pregnant woman's life.</p>
      <p>State Rep. Candice Keller, a Republican from Middletown, says the bill's backers are tired of taking an incremental approach to ending abortion.</p>
      <p>"The time for regulating evil and compromise is over," she said in a statement. "The time has come to abolish abortion in its entirety and recognize that each individual has the inviolable and inalienable Right to Life."</p>
      <p>The legislation, introduced Thursday, declares a fetus a person and would subject doctors who terminate pregnancies to potential murder charges.</p>
      <p>The bill makes an exception for the life of the pregnant woman, saying a doctor would escape prosecution for performing "a surgery, before the unborn child is viable, for the sole purpose of treating the pregnant woman's fatal condition."</p>
      <p>Ohio is among states that have passed restrictive abortion laws in recent years in hopes of sparking a legal challenge that would overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion. Abortion opponents have been emboldened by the new conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>"This has been the goal of the grassroots of the pro-life movement since the disastrous Roe decision of 1973," stated Margie Christie, president of the Right to Life Action Coalition of Ohio.</p>
      <p>But Ohio Right to Life, the state's oldest and largest anti-abortion group, was not involved in the latest effort and is neutral.</p>
      <p>Abortion rights groups lined up to blast the bill, calling it medically dangerous and insulting to women.</p>
      <p>"This is yet another attack on the sacred physician-patient relationship and on reproductive health care," Lauren Blauvelt-Copelin, of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, said in a statement. "This extreme bill goes to outlandish levels to further restrict Ohioans' decisions around health care and parenting."</p>
