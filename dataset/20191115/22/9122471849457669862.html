      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:15:41+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Penn State had an opportunity to enter its game against Ohio State as one of the top-three teams in the country. However, with their loss to Minnesota on Saturday afternoon, the Nittany Lions will likely fall short once more of a Big Ten title.</p>
      <p>Penn State would have to win-out, which means a win over Ohio State in Columbus. The Nittany Lions have a chance to bounce back this weekend with a home game against a surprising Indiana team.</p>
      <p>The Hoosiers sit at 7-2 on the season and have won four-straight games heading into Saturday afternoon’s game.</p>
      <p>Tim Allen’s Hoosiers boast a solid defense that gives up just 20 points per game. Can they slow down a Penn State offense that scores over 37 points per contest?</p>
      <p>More on tomorrow’s huge Big Ten game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>Saturday, 12:00 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel: </b>ABC</p>
      <p><b>Spread: </b>Penn State -14.5</p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>55.5</p>
      <p><b>Announcers:</b>Jason Bennetti, Rod Gilmore, Quint Kessenich</p>
      <p>Indiana’s only two losses have come from Ohio State and Michigan State. The Hoosiers are riding a nice win-streak and have the momentum heading into Beaver Stadium this weekend.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, James Franklin needs to right the ship with a win on Saturday to have a shot at a conference title and potential College Football Playoff berth.</p>
