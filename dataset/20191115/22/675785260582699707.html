      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Duchess of Cambridge will be guest of honour on Mary’s big BBC1 Christmas show after the pair became pals through their charity work</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:18:34+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:18</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Methven, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-methven/</a></address>
      <p>It’s the Kate British Bake Off... as the Duchess of Cambridge teams up with cookery queen Mary Berry for a royal festive TV treat.</p>
      <p>Kate will be guest of honour on Mary’s big BBC1 Christmas show after the pair became pals through their charity work.</p>
      <p>They are expected to create a feast to reward charity workers who are on duty over Christmas and New Year.</p>
      <p>Ex-Bake Off star Mary will take charge of laying on a festive spread, with Kate and other VIPs helping out – and it may even take place at a royal venue.</p>
      <p>A source said: “What better way to spread some Christmas cheer than to team up cookery royalty Mary Berry with real royalty in the form of Kate?</p>

      <p>“Between them they will bring seasonal goodwill to their guests and to the millions of viewers watching. Expect a properly uplifting Christmas treat.”</p>
      <p>The two women met in 2013 at an event for Child Bereavement UK, of which both Mary and the Duke of Cambridge are patrons.</p>
      <p>They are thought to have bonded over their shared love of gardening – Mary is an ambassador for the Royal Horticultural Society and president of the National Garden Scheme, and Kate designed a garden for the Chelsea Flower Show this year.</p>

      <p>In September the two women were seen laughing uproariously together as Mary, 84, helped Kate, 37, launch a Back to Nature children’s garden at RHS Wisley.</p>
      <p>The one-off TV special next month, which has the working title of The Mary Berry Royal Christmas Show, is being made for the BBC by Shine TV.</p>
      <p>Filming has already started and will continue over the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>A BBC spokesman declined to comment on the TV special, saying only: “All will be revealed in due course.”</p>
