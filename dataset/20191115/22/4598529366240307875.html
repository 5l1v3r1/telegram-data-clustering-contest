      <p>That escalated quickly.</p>
      <p>Amid the <a href="https://dash.parsely.com/talkingpointsmemo.com/posts/dMp7uJudMaZ-key-moments-from-yovanovitchs-testimony-on-smear-campaign-that-forced-her-out/?minutes=10">public impeachment testimony</a> of ousted Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch Friday, a Twitter showdown unfolded between Donald Trump Jr. and George Conway.</p>
      <p>Trump Jr. fired the first shot at Conway — who has ironically gained notoriety for his vehement criticism of President Trump, despite his wife Kellyanne serving as a senior aide in the administration — in a Friday afternoon tweet responding to Conway’s take on the public testimonies of Yovanovitch, career diplomat Bill Taylor and top State Department official George Kent this week.</p>

      <p>The spat only escalated from there with Conway hitting back at Trump Jr. by responding that he’s “not the one shilling for your criminal father.”</p>

      <p>Conway then responded again to the same Trump Jr. tweet by arguing that he’s “not building a brand,” while also slamming the President’s son for using nepotism to his advantage.</p>

      <p>It didn’t end there.</p>
      <p>When Trump Jr. tweeted a link to a Breitbart article accusing Conway of “prancing around the campaign offices during the transition aimlessly hoping to get a job” in the Trump administration — a tweet that didn’t directly mention Conway’s Twitter account nor any of his tweets — Conway hit back by responding that the President’s son lies just as much as his father.</p>

      <p>After the Twitter skirmish appeared to end, Trump Jr. continued retweeting other Trumpworld figures who attacked Conway, including Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale and adviser Katrina Pierson.</p>
