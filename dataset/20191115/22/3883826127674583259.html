        <b>"I'm speechless. This is sick. We made it!"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Finland's men have qualified for a major tournament for the first time in their history and striker Teemu Pukki could barely believe it.</p>
      <p>Actually, the whole of Finland could barely believe it.</p>
      <p>Friday's 3-0 victory over Liechtenstein means the Eagle-owls will be at Euro 2020 next summer, after securing second spot in qualifying Group J, behind winners Italy</p>
      <p>Jasse Tuominen's first-half strike and a Pukki double - one from the penalty spot - ended a run of 32 failed qualifying campaigns for either the World Cup or European Championship, and sparked jubilant scenes.</p>

      <p>"There's a party for sure," Pukki told BBC World Service after the game.</p>
      <p>"We had some moments of joy, we were celebrating what we had achieved.</p>
      <p>"The coach is wet, that is something we do. He deserved it. Many of us have been with him since the under-21s and he knows how to make us play our best football."</p>
      <p>Topias Kauhala, a journalist for Finnish sports magazine ELMO, said: "After all these years and what Finland has been through as a national team, people have tears in their eyes, grown men.</p>
      <p>"It's something you haven't seen in Finnish football before, crying with these emotional moments. It's a once in a lifetime moment.</p>
      <p>"This is mainly a sporting achievement but we're a small nation so we're quite happy when we get noticed around the world."</p>

        <figcaption>The full-time whistle sparked a pitch invasion in Helsinki</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Hundreds rushed on to the Sonera Stadium pitch at full-time and manager Markku Kanerva, a former teacher, conducted his post-match interview with fireworks going off in the distance.</p>
      <p>Crowds gathered at a huge screen in the capital while a viewing party was hosted in the city by Premier League side Norwich City, whose striker Pukki has become the talisman of Finland's qualifying campaign with nine goals in nine matches.</p>
      <p>His exploits for club and country have given birth to the #PukkiParty trend on social media and the Canaries are hosting an official Pukki Party in a Helsinki night club on Friday. They even opened a pop-up Norwich City store in the city to capitalise on the interest in their star striker.</p>
      <p>Finland's Prime Minister Antti Rinne, who earlier this year gifted a Pukki shirt to French president Emmanuel Macron, <a href="https://twitter.com/AnttiRinnepj/status/1195416030576820224">tweeted:</a> "An incredible performance, Congratulations and thank you! Oh Finland is, oh Finland is, oh Finland is finally in the men's soccer championship!"</p>
      <p>Finland goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky suggested 15 November - the day his country confirmed qualification for Euro 2020 - will go down in history.</p>
      <p>"This could be a date for a national holiday in my opinion," he said. "We made our dreams come true, plenty of people share that thought with us."</p>
