      <p>VALHALLA, New York (WABC) -- The New York Mets pulled off an Amazin' surprise for an 8-year-old boy at a Westchester Hospital.</p>
      <p>Back in October, Jack suffered an unexpected rupture of a blood vessel in his brain while playing baseball, causing him to collapse. He underwent surgery, and then extensive rehabilitation at Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Mets Director of Player Relations Donovan Mitchell surprised Jack and his family with a visit to his hospital room with a bag full of Mets goodies, an invitation to Citi Field for a game, an autographed photo and baseball from Jack's favorite player, Brandon Nimmo.</p>
      <p>Nimmo also surprised Jack with a special 'Get Well Soon' message.</p>
      <p>Jack is currently re-learning how to walk so he can get back to one of his favorite activities - playing baseball.</p>
