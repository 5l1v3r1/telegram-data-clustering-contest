      <p>Our regular <a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/topics/firmware+friday">Firmware Friday</a> roundup this week is a little unusual in that most of the updates for which we have news aren't actually available just yet, although a few are already here and more will arrive in the coming days. In all, we have news of firmware updates for two cameras and one lens in the past seven days, plus planned updates for a further seven cameras and an unspecified number of drones. And on top of all this, there are a further four software updates which are already available.</p>
      <p>There's clearly plenty to discuss here, so let's get right down to it!</p>
      <h3>Canon EOS R and IVY REC Outdoor Camera</h3>
      <p>Kicking things off alphabetically with Canon, the company has both shipped one update in the past week, and announced development of another. The IVY REC Outdoor Camera has received updated software for the second week running, with four changes as follows in version 1.0.2, which can be obtained in either the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.canon.cebm.minicam.android.us&amp;hl=en">Google Play Store</a> or the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canon-mini-cam/id1468048366">Apple App Store</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixes an issue in which selecting cancel on the device does not work when  attempting to auto re-connect to the IVY REC Outdoor Camera.</li>
        <li>Improves ability for devices running iOS 13 to create a WiFi connection with IVY REC Outdoor Camera.</li>
        <li>Improves the stability of the remote continuous shooting function when connected to devices running iOS.</li>
        <li>Improves wireless reconnection when the Mode Dial Switch is turned to Photo/Video/Multi mode from wireless mode.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The new firmware for the Canon EOS R, meanwhile, is slated to arrive by year's end and will add support for the RF 85mm F1.2 L USM DS lens. Watch for more on this in a future roundup!</p>
      <h3>DJI drones (models unspecified)</h3>
      <p>Next up, we have Chinese drone maker DJI, which this week publicly demonstrated firmware under development for some of its drones. (The company doesn't say which, precisely, will eventually be receiving the updates, but notes that it will be available for "many drones already in widespread use, without any extra cost or equipment", and demoed the new features on both the DJI Mavic Air and Mavic 2 Enterprise models.)</p>
      <p>So what's new? Well, with updated firmware and a smartphone app for Android devices from the likes of Google, Samsung and Xiaomi, the updated drones can broadcast flight information using the Wi-Fi Aware standard. DJI says that its own testing found this to work at a range of more than one kilometer (0.6 miles). Flight information which can be broadcast includes the location of the pilot, the location, altitude, speed and heading of the drone itself, plus a unique identifier for the drone and a user-provided description of the purpose of the flight. The idea is that both law enforcement and the general public will be able to obtain information about the flights for safety and privacy reasons, something which will become mandatory in Europe from July of next year, and which is also expected to be mandatory in the USA from 2021 or thereabouts. <a href="https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-demonstrates-direct-drone-to-phone-remote-identification">More info can be found on DJI's website</a>.</p>
      <h3>Fujifilm X-T3, XF16-80mmF4 R OIS WR and MacOS software</h3>
      <p>Fujifilm has also both shipped new firmware and announced development of updates in the past week. The new firmware, <a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/software/firmware/lens/xf16-80mm/index.html">which you can download here</a>, promises more accurate autofocus and improved optical image stabilization as well as fixes for "slight defects" with the XF16-80mmF4 R OIS WR lens.</p>
      <p>There are two planned updates for the Fuji X-T3 mirrorless camera, meanwhile, slated to arrive in December 2019 and January 2020 respectively. The first will bring USB tethered remote control of video capture, exposure mode, shutter speed, aperture, ISO sensitivity, exposure compensation and manual focus from certain drone-based or handheld gimbals from DJI and Zhiyun. The second update will improve face detection performance when faces of varied sizes are within the image frame, as well as eye detection tracking performance and how the camera handles scenes with a complex mixture of foreground and background detail. It will also increase the limit on the number of files per folder tenfold, to as many as 9,999 files per folder.</p>
      <p>And finally for Fuji, the company has also released updated versions of three apps to correct issues with MacOS Catalina 10.15.1, on which <a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2019/11/01/firmware-friday-software-aplenty-firmware-too-from-blackmagic-canon-fuji-ni">we reported a couple of weeks back</a>. Updated apps include the Silkypix-based Raw File Converter EX 3.0 (<a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/software/myfinepix_studio/rfc_3/mac_01/">download here</a>), the X Acquire installer (<a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/software/x_acquire/mac/">download here</a>) and the Tether Plug-in PRO for GFX for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic CC / 6 (<a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/software/lrplugin_for_gfx/mac/">download here</a>). The Raw File Converter and X Acquire updates also add support for the X-Pro3 camera body. A variety of other apps still remain on the list to be corrected, including Fujifilm PC AutoSave, the X Raw Studio installer, as well as the Tether Shooting Plug-in PRO for GFX, Tether Shooting Plug-in and Tether Shooting Plug-in PRO for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.</p>
      <h3>Panasonic GH5, GH5S, G9, S1 and S1R</h3>

      <h3>Sigma fp</h3>
      <p>Firmware version 1.01 for the Sigma fp also arrived last Friday after we'd already written that week's roundup, and so rolled over to this one instead. Its development was <a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2019/10/25/firmware-friday-seven-cameras-from-blackmagic-canon-leica-ricoh-and-sigma-g">revealed in a late-October roundup</a>, and as well as the two fixes promised at that time, also corrects two further operational issues which have been discovered since. In all, changes are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Corrects the phenomenon when the recording to the external SSD drive. Regardless of the recording bit and frame rate part of the first and second frames of playback will be enlarged as well as the thumbnail images when the recording format is set to Cinema DNG and the resolution is set to UHD.</li>
        <li>Corrects the phenomenon whereby shooting in the Cinema DNG format, depending on the ISO sensitivity the level of the dark area changes for each frame.</li>
        <li>Corrects the phenomenon whereby some parts of the recorded video become disordered.</li>
        <li>Corrects the phenomenon whereby the camera freeze when the lens firmware is updated through files downloaded via Mac.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The firmware update and its installation procedure <a href="https://www.sigma-global.com/en/download/cameras/firmware/#fp">can be found here</a>.</p>
      <h3>Sony RX10 Mark IV</h3>
      <p>Finally for this week, we have firmware version 2.00 for the Sony DSC-RX10 Mark IV, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/compact-cameras-dsc-rx-series/dsc-rx10m4/downloads/00016420">here for Windows</a>, or <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/compact-cameras-dsc-rx-series/dsc-rx10m4/downloads/00016421">here for MacOS</a>. There are just three changes, as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Adds real-time Eye AF for animals<br/>* It is not possible to detect simultaneously human and animal eyes. Eye detection may not be possible depending on the environment, animal type or the movement of the animal.</li>
        <li>Enables the possibility to operate the real-time EYE AF by half-pressing the shutter button</li>
        <li>Improves the overall stability of the camera</li>
      </ol>
      <p>And that's all for this week. Check back next time for more firmware news!</p>
