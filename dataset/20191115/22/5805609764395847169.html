      <p>Well, if we look around, we will find that now almost everyone has a personal computer. Computers and smartphones are now an essential part of our life because most of our everyday work depends on them. Let’s admit, some of us are using a computer which is almost 5 to 6 years old.</p>
      <p>Having an old computer is not a problem, but when a computer is used for a long time, a large number of files were saved on the hard disk drives, leading to performance degradation. It’s worth to note that the lifetime of a hard disk is just a few years and they are more prone to damage.</p>
      <p>Even if your hard disk drive is in the working state, it will fail to satisfy your requirement for speed and storage. So, the best way to deal with such issues is by upgrading to a larger hard drive. If we talk about upgrading to a larger hard drive, what we all know is that we have to install a fresh Windows on a new drive.</p>
      <p>However, that’s not true. You can actually upgrade to a larger hard drive without losing any data. So, in this article, we are going to share a working method that would help you to upgrade to a larger hard drive without losing any single data. So, let’s check out how to upgrade to a larger hard drive without data loss.</p>
      <h3>How to Upgrade to a Larger Hard Drive Without Re-Installing Windows</h3>
      <p>To upgrade to a larger hard drive without data loss, we need to use EaseUS Todo Backup. It’s specialized software for home and business users and it provides users the easiest way to back up the system and important data to new hard drives. So, basically it’s cloning software.</p>
      <p><b>Step 1.</b> The very first thing that you would require is to connect both of the new as well as old hard drives to the same computer. This could be easy with the PC, but for the laptops, you could need to get some other modules for the purpose. SATA-to-USB cable would let you connect the hard drive to the laptop via USB cable.</p>
      <p><b>Step 2.</b> Once both the hard disk have been plugged in and ready to use, its time to move the data. For that, install <a href="https://www.easeus.com/backup-software/">EaseUS Todo Backup</a> software and choose the option ‘Clone’</p>
