      <p>Former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star <a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/kim-richards">Kim Richards</a> is writing an autobiography.</p>
      <p>Richards — whose on- and off-screen highs and lows have made for numerous headlines through the years — broke the news to Page Six on Friday, telling us she just finished her first draft and that HarperCollins is publishing the memoir.</p>
      <p>“It’ll be all about my life,” she told us during BravoCon.</p>

      <p>Richards, 55, said it was “rough” re-examining her past while getting the book together.</p>

      <p>“I’ve always been spiritual, but then I really started digging in and looking at really, like, who I was, who I became and who I am today,” she told us. “Only time knows who I’ll end up being. I’m really continuing to grow and it’s been a process. Looking back at my life, every bit of it from the beginning, was very, wow. Some of the … painful parts were tough. It’s been beautiful, too. I’ve grown a lot.”</p>

      <p>On the first season of “RHOBH,” Kim’s sister and co-star, Kyle Richards, revealed that Kim was an alcoholic, causing family drama to come to light at the show’s reunion. The sisters’ dramatic relationship played out on the air until Kim left “RHOBH” in Season 5 (2014-2015), though she occasionally still makes cameos on the show.</p>
