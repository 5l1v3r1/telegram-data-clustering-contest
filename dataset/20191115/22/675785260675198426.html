      <p>Phil Foden could gatecrash England’s Euro 2020 squad.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate has admitted the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> teenager is on his radar ahead of a potential senior call-up.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has only made three Premier League starts for his club but has been singled out as one of England’s best young prospects.</p>
      <p>England boss Southgate also opened the door for a recall for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> ’s Dele Alli who has missed the last two squads despite being one of the stars of the last World Cup campaign.</p>
      <p>Southgate said: “You know, we’re still looking at Foden and thinking that it’s a case of when, rather than if, unless something goes wildly off-track for him.</p>

      <p>“So, there are some very good players, talented players that weren’t in this squad. Obviously, guys that have been with us before like Dele as well. We have got incredible competition for places, particularly in those attacking five positions.</p>
      <p>“And form and performances with club - we can’t select on just the international games because there aren’t enough of them and the level of the opposition has been at a certain level.</p>
      <p>"We’ve got to see who are our best players to be able to play against those top teams.”</p>
      <p>Foden has become a regular at under-21 level but has struggled for game time at the Etihad, although City boss Pep Guardiola has stressed that he is the “most talented player” he has ever seen and would not sell him at any price.</p>
