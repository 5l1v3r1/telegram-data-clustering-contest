      <h1>Harry Kane gives blow-by-blow account of Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez incident fallout</h1>
      <h2>Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez had an altercation at England's training ground canteen after Liverpool vs Man City - Harry Kane has explained what happened next</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>Harry Kane has lifted the lid on the dramatic events at St George’s Park that led to Raheem Sterling’s expulsion from the England team.</p>
      <p>With Joe Gomez being jeered by some sections of the Wembley crowd on Thursday, the fallout from his bust-up with Sterling is still being felt in Gareth Southgate’s camp.</p>
      <p>But as, for the first time, Kane spoke in detail about the incident and its ramifications, what is becoming clear is that Sterling is the one being held fully accountable by the squad and the management for the ugly scenes in the players’ canteen.</p>
      <p>And it is also clear Kane was concerned about the emotional state of a shocked Gomez, who he spoke to at least twice in private to make sure he was coping.</p>

      <p>After gathering evidence, the England skipper’s main concern appeared to be the welfare of Gomez.</p>
      <p>Kane explained: “I was not in the room when it happened. So after it happened I asked a few of the players about what went on.</p>
      <p>“I then spoke to Joe privately about how he was feeling. Emotions had run high just after it happened so I spoke to Raz and then me and a few of the senior players spoke about what we should do.</p>
      <p>“Joe and Raz then got together and had a chat. After that, I spoke to Joe again to see how he was feeling. He was feeling better after his chat with Raz.”</p>
      <p>Yet the severity of the confrontation, instigated by Sterling, was such that Kane, experienced team-mates and Southgate knew there had to be some punishment.</p>

      <p>“The gaffer spoke to me and a few of the senior players and we made the decision we wanted to make and we did it as a group,” said Kane. “Raz missed the game, apologised, and him and Joe were fine after that.</p>
      <p>“We had a private meeting and I won’t discuss what we said but it is about understanding what went on and why, speaking to both players and trying to control it.</p>
      <p>“It was a different week to what I have been used to. In life, in football, as one of the leaders, stuff happens and you have to adapt and control the situation and me, the gaffer and Hendo - who was involved even though he was not there - handled it as well as we could have, I think.</p>
      <p>“Raz has owned up to everything. He put out a tweet and apologised to Joe and has taken not playing on the chin.</p>

      <p>“Raz is a great professional and we want to move on and try and win our last game.”</p>
      <p>But as much as Kane, Southgate and the England squad would like to draw a line under the matter, the focus will remain on Gomez and, in particular, on Sterling, who will come back into the side for tomorrow’s game in Kosovo.</p>
      <p>It will be intriguing to see what sort of reception Sterling gets from the travelling England supporters after a minority at Wembley on Thursday booed Gomez.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender, obviously the innocent and wronged party in the saga, cut a forlorn figure after the match, despite being counselled by several squad-mates and by Southgate.</p>
      <p>Even though the booing was not sustained or coming from a majority, it did upset Gomez and his family inside Wembley.</p>
      <p>Kane said: “I find it really confusing why he was booed. I don’t think any player should be booed. I know how important club football but at international level, we are all England fans and the bottom line is that Joe is a great guy - one of the nicest guys I have ever met.</p>
      <p>“I spoke to him and he seemed fine. It was confusing but we cannot control the fans or what they do but Joe has a top mentality and is fighting to play on Sunday.”</p>
      <p>And as Southgate looks to finally put the matter to bed, do not be surprised if you see Gomez and Sterling line up next to each other.</p>
