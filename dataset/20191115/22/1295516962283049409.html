      <p>Welcome to Comic Book Legends Revealed! This is the seven hundred and fifty-sixth installment where we examine <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/comic-book-legends-revealed">comic book legends</a> and whether they are true or false.</p>

      <h3>COMIC LEGEND:</h3>
      <p>Brent Anderson was offered the job on Uncanny X-Men after Dave Cockrum left the second time.</p>
      <h3>STATUS:</h3>
      <p>True</p>
      <p>In late 1980, John Byrne left Uncanny X-Men as the co-plotter and penciler of the book...</p>

      <p>Brent Anderson did a fill-in issue following Byrne's departure...</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This gave time for Dave Cockrum to return to the series to take over as penciler (more like blue line pencils)...</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Anderson then launched an acclaimed Ka-Zar series, Ka-Zar the Savage, with writer Bruce Jones...</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Well, fast forward a year and a half or so and Cockrum was about to bow out on Uncanny <a href="https://screenrant.com/xmen-comic-reboot-marvel-plot-holes-mutants/">X-Men</a>...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uncanny-x-men-164.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=1480&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Anderson, meanwhile, had quit Ka-Zar the Savage, because he was falling behind on deadlines on the book.</p>
      <p>Anderson had done an X-Men Annual earlier...</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>and had more recently done another fill-in issue...</p>
      <figure>

      <p>That's when we come to an interview John Rhett Thomas did with Anderson for one of those Marvel one-shot things they used to do around 2005 ...</p>
      <p>"John Rhett Thomas: Neal Adams was the original scheduled artist for the graphic novel, but things didn't quite work out with him continuing on with the book. When did you find out that you were going to be the guy to draw God Loves, Man Kills?</p>
      <p>Brent Anderson: Chris came to me when I was finishing up my run on Ka-Zar. I was frustrated that I was unable to hit the deadlines for that book, doing the kind of work I like to do - the better-drawn work, in my opinion - and that was almost exactly the same time Dave Cockrum had put in his notice on the X-Men. So I went into Weezie's office (Editor Louise Simonson) and I was complaining, "Oh, God I can't do good enough work!" and stuff like that. I told her that I had to leave Ka-Zar and start doing some one-shots or something. And then she said, "Oh, that's too bad because Dave Cockrum just left X-Men and Chris and I wanted to know if you wanted to pick it up!" And I said, "What?! I came in here to quit Ka-Zar because I didn't think I could draw the main characters well enough and now you're telling me you want me to draw the X-Men?!?! They have seven main characters, I just can't do that amount of work." And she said, "Well I think your quality is fine and you're doing a great job but it's up to you."</p>
      <p>So then Chris came in the office and he said, "I heard you turned down my X-Men book." He said he had a graphic novel he was supposed to do and Neal Adams couldn't do it for whatever reasons and he asked if I wanted to do it and I said, "Perfect! It's the X-Men, it's a one-shot, I get to take my time on i, it would be part of their graphic novel group, which would have that nice paper with that Marvel color that Steve Oliff had developed, that gray line Marvel color. And I thought, man this is great. I get to pencil, ink AND color it - or supervise the color by hiring whomeve I wanted to color it, and I got Steve Oliff. So it was a dream project."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But hey, we got an amazing graphic novel out of it!</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the success of the project, Anderson again avoided mainstream comics, choosing instead to do an Epic series with his Ka-Zar collaborator, Bruce Jones...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/somerset-holmes.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=1489&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>And Uncanny X-Men ended up with a guy named Paul Smith, who turned out okay, as well...</p>
