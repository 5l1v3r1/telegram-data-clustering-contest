        <b>HIBS might have looked outside the box when they added Darren Fletcher and John Kennedy to their wishlist.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But in Jack Ross they have someone who ticks ALL the boxes for the Easter Road club right now.</p>

      <p>Look, with any managerial appointment there’s an element of risk, even with the very top bosses, but on the face of it this looks like another progressive appointment by Leeann Dempster.</p>
      <p>There’s no doubt that in recent times <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14943/hibernian/">Hibs</a>’ most successful managers have been either young and hungry and on the way up, or people with a point to prove.</p>
      <p>Tony Mowbray was a left-field choice that worked out big time. Alan Stubbs was another.</p>
      <p>Even Neil Lennon, to a degree, was a move that not a lot of people saw coming at the time.</p>

      <p>They tried something similar with Paul Heckingbottom and in the end that was too left-field, even for them.</p>
      <p>Mowbray, Stubbs and Lennon, though, all knew the Scottish game, having played here.</p>
      <p>And having that sort of history is a clear advantage that Heckingbottom didn’t have, but Ross clearly does.</p>
      <p>His critics will point to the fact that he had a good budget at Sunderland and didn’t get them up. That’s a valid argument and something Ross will have to answer to.</p>
      <p>But it doesn’t disqualify him from being in the running for a job like Hibs — just as Derek McInnes’ time at Bristol City didn’t stop <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Aberdeen</a> being interested in him.</p>
      <p>Del’s time in England didn’t make him a bad manager, likewise Ross’ time at the Stadium of Light.</p>
      <p>But at the same time just because going for McInnes worked for the Dons it’s not a given that Ross will be a success at Hibs.</p>
      <p>What I will say is it’s not like Sunderland’s form has suddenly picked up since Ross has moved on.</p>

      <p>The job Ross did at St Mirren cannot be underestimated — they were on their way to League One when he went in there.</p>
      <p>He turned them around and got them promoted to the Premiership with a squad of players you wouldn’t say was that good. That team, remember, had to get ripped up and improved just to have a chance of staying in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Ross is fresh, he has good ideas, he’ll get Hibs playing football the way their fans want to see the game being played.</p>
      <p>So it seems like a good fit.</p>
      <p>What is clear is that Hibs went into this process with a clear idea of what they wanted. Sure, they may have ultimately come up short in their attempts to speak to Kennedy and Fletcher.</p>
      <p>But they were looking to the future. There was a profile there, a clarity of thinking.</p>
      <p>It was always going to be difficult for them to get Kennedy in such a pivotal season for <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> as they chase nine in a row.</p>
      <p>I have heard nothing but good things about big John as a coach and, who knows, he may well have designs on being a manager someday soon.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Hibs job could have been a fantastic opportunity in that respect but I can also understand why Lennon was so keen to keep him.</p>
      <p>It’s a similar situation with Fletcher, who is another who wants to be a manager at some point, just not yet.</p>
      <p>My old team-mate has already been touted for a role at Manchester United, otherwise he might have kept playing on this season.</p>
      <p>But he has made it known he wants to get some experience before throwing himself into a manager’s job.</p>
      <p>What Ross, Kennedy and Fletcher all have in common is they are young, hungry and desperate to prove themselves.</p>
      <p>And the positive for Hibs is there are boys there Ross has worked with before and others he will inevitably have a good understanding of.</p>
      <p>As I have said all along Hibs have the makings of a very good squad but there are also some gaping holes that need to be filled.</p>
      <p>Ross has six weeks to get through to the winter break before he can start to plug those gaps.</p>

      <p>Centre-half and centre midfield are the two positions where they are crying out for reinforcements.</p>
      <p>And while Dylan McGeouch might not have played for him at Sunderland he’d certainly do a job for him at Hibs.</p>
      <p>Dylan would help straight away, he would be someone the Hibs fans could relate to straight away as well, unlike some of Heckingbottom’s signings.</p>
      <p>I don’t know what the working relationship between the two is like — I’m sure Dylan wouldn’t have been too happy not playing at Sunderland.</p>
      <p>But if he was to come to Hibs, knowing he was going to get game time, it would be a win-win situation for both parties.</p>
