      <p>The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on Friday upheld the withdrawal of income tax exemption granted to Young Indian, an entity controlled by Congress president <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sonia-gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a> and her family since assessment year 2011-12. The company was incorporated in FY12. The tribunal dismissed the appeal made by Young Indian seeking that its exemption not be withdrawn retrospectively.</p>
      <p>In its order, the Delhi bench of the tribunal said, “No genuine activities have been carried out by the assessee either in furtherance of its objects or otherwise, which can be held to be for charitable purpose because one of the so-called purpose of acquiring Associated Journals Ltd [AJL] was not carried out at all.</p>
      <p>“Otherwise, also, we have already discussed and given our categorical findings that till the grant of the registration and surrender made by the assessee, no worthwhile activities were carried out by AJL… what it turns out to be is that the assessee has acquired AJL, a company that owns property worth hundreds of crores from which the AJL had been enjoying only rental income,” the tribunal said.</p>
