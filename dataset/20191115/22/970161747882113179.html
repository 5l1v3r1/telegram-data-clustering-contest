      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maisie-smith/">Maisie Smith</a> emerged as the winner tonight of EastEnders’ very own <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> special for Children in Need.</p>
      <p>The actress – who portrays <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tiffany-butcher/">Tiffany Butcher</a> in the soap – was competing against fellow castmates Louisa Litton, Rudolph Walker and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ricky-champ/">Ricky Champ</a>.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old was partnered with Strictly pro Kevin Clifton for a special group routine to the classic bop Dancing in the Street, which has been performed by everyone from Van Halen to David Bowie and Mick Jagger.</p>
      <p>But in the battle of Walford, it was the youngster who came out on top in the end.</p>
      <p>Judges Shirley Ballas, Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Motsi Mabuse all conferred on the decision – and awarded Maisie with the very special Pudsey edition of the famous Glitterball trophy.</p>

      <p>‘It’s been amazing.’</p>
      <p>The only question remaining now of course…is when is Maisie going to sign up to the main show?!</p>
      <p>It was a question many fans found themselves asking too.</p>

      <p>‘You were amazing Maisie,’ one fan wrote. ‘You should be on next year’s Strictly!’</p>
      <p>Another fan clearly agreed, adding: ‘Maisie Smith just had to do Strictly next year.’</p>
