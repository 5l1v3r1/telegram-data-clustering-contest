What did they say?</a>
          </h4>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The inquiry is centred on a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/profile-volodymyr-zelensky-190418131155087.html">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> in which the US leader asked his Ukrainian counterpart to open an investigation into former US Vice President Joe Biden, who is also a top Democratic 2020 presidential contender, and his son, Hunter, who had served on a board of a Ukrainian gas company. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. </p>
      <p>The call came to light due to a whistle-blower complaint. At the time of the call, the US was withholding nearly $400m in military aid from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ukraine.html">Ukraine</a>, prompting speculation that Trump was using the money as leverage to get the desired investigations. The money was later released. </p>
      <p>Trump has denied that any quid pro quo (Latin for "favour for a favour") took place, describing the call as "perfect". </p>
      <p>As the public phase of the impeachment inquiry continues, here are all the latest updates as of Friday, November 15:</p>
      <h4>Public testimony of former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch ends</h4>
      <p>The former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch publicly testified for about five hours as part of the House <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/190926061142695.html">impeachment inquiry</a> into US President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>In her testimony on Friday, Yovanovitch largely described a smear campaign against her, lead by the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his associates, that undermined national interests and security for the personal gain of others.</p>
      <p>She also warned that the undermining of her ambassadorship has hurt morale at the State Department and could potentially make the mission of other US diplomats more difficult. </p>
      <p>Questions from Democrats mostly sought to support this narrative, while Republican questioning attempted to portray Yovanovitch's concerns as an internal State Department issue unrelated to the impeachment investigation. </p>
      <p>Tuesday will begin the next series of public hearings. Set to testify are Jennifer Williams, the special adviser to Vice President Mike Pence for Europe and Russia, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/trump-impeachment-inquiry-vindman-hill-testimonies-released-191108182018428.html">Alexander Vindman</a>, a US Army officer assigned to the National Security Council, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/envoy-ukraine-testifies-part-impeachment-inquiry-191003220312334.html">Kurt Volker</a>, a former US special envoy to Ukraine, and Timothy Morrison, a White House aide with the National Security Council.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a House panel will also hear behind closed doors from career diplomat David Holmes, an aide to Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, who is expected to discuss his recollection of a July 26 call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union.</p>

      <h4>Trump: Twitter posts during Yovanovitch hearing were not intimidating</h4>
      <p>US President Donald Trump has said he does not believe his Twitter posts were intimidating after his real-time attack on former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch drew criticism during a public hearing as part of the House <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/190926061142695.html">impeachment inquiry</a>.</p>
      <p>"I don't think so at all," Trump told reporters at the White House when asked whether his tweets or words can be intimidating.</p>
      <p>Trump said he watched a little bit of the second public impeachment hearing on Friday and "thought it was a disgrace".</p>
      <p>Democrats had accused Trump of witness intimidation after he said "everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad".</p>
      <h4>Yovanovitch says Trump political ally suggested she 'send out a tweet, praise the president' to save her job</h4>
      <p>Former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch described an exchange with Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/trump-ally-sondland-admits-tying-ukraine-aid-biden-probe-191105190626265.html">Gordon Sondland</a> during the House impeachment hearing on Friday.</p>
      <p>When it became clear that Yovanovitch would be removed her post, Sondland suggested she "send out a tweet, praise the president", she said. Yovanovitch said she rejected the advice.</p>
      <p>Sondland was a Trump campaign contributor who was appointed by the president to the prestigious post.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch said Sondland's advice was to "go big or go home," which he explained meant lauding Trump.</p>
      <p>She says she didn't do it because, "It felt partisan, it felt political" and inappropriate for an ambassador".</p>

      <h4>White House: Trump tweet about Yovanovitch 'not witness intimidation'</h4>
      <p>The White House says President Donald Trump's tweets criticising former US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch as she testified before the House as part of its impeachment inquiry was "not witness intimidation".</p>
      <p>In a statement, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said the tweet was "simply the President's opinion, which he is entitled to".</p>
      <p>Trump has drawn criticism for tweeting early in Yovanovitch's testimony that everywhere the career diplomat was posted "turned bad".</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch said the tweets were "very intimidating" to her and other witnesses.</p>
      <h4>Yovanovitch rejects Trump claim that Ukraine tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election</h4>
      <p>Former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is rejecting the notion that Ukraine tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, as President Donald Trump has proposed.</p>
      <p>Trump has said that Ukraine tried to "take me down".</p>
      <p>Testifying in Friday's impeachment hearing, Yovanovitch said "we didn't really see it that way."</p>
      <p>She noted that the US intelligence community "has conclusively determined" that those who <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/indicts-12-russian-spies-2016-election-meddling-charges-180713171351845.html">interfered</a> in that election were in Russia.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch also pushed back against Trump's suggestions that former Vice President Joe Biden was pursuing his own interests in Ukraine during President Barack Obama's administration.</p>
      <p>She said he was pursuing "official US policy".</p>

      <h4>Nunes: 'I'm not exactly sure what the ambassador's doing here today'</h4>
      <p>The ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes has said he is unsure why diplomat Marie Yovanovitch had been called to testify publicly in the impeachment investigation.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the Republican committee members allocated 45-minute questioning period as part of Friday's hearing, Nunes said Yovanovitch is "not a material fact witness" and portrayed the ambassador as unrelated to the central questions House investigators are trying to answer - whether the president pressured a foreign government into conducting investigations for his own political gain. </p>
      <p>"You admitted in your opening statement that you don't have any first-hand information of what we're looking into to," Nunes said. </p>
      <h4>Schiff says Trump tweet 'witness intimidation in real-time by the president of the United States'</h4>
      <p>Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee leading the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump, said a tweet by the president criticising the former ambassador to Ukraine during her public hearing was "witness intimidation in real-time by the president of the United States".</p>
      <p>Schiff made the statement to reporters during a break from the public testimony of former diplomat Marie Yovanovitch on Friday. </p>
      <p>In the tweet, Trump said that "everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad" and said the Ukrainian president "spoke unfavourably of her" during the July 25 <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/read-white-house-memo-trump-call-ukraine-leader-190925140938765.html">phone call</a> between the two leaders at the heart of the investigation. </p>
      <h4>Schiff reads Trump tweet to Yovanovitch</h4>
      <p>Adam Schiff, the Democratic Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, read a tweet by President Donald Trump attacking former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during her<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/ousted-ambassador-yovanovitch-testify-impeachment-probe-191115130056141.html"> public hearing</a>. </p>
      <p>Asked if she agreed with Trump's assertion that "everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad", Yovanovitch said: "I actually think that where I've served over the years I and others have demonstrably made things better."</p>
      <p>When asked by Schiff if she found the president's attacks intimidating, she responded, "It's very intimidating".</p>
      <p>"Some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously," Schiff said. </p>

      <h4>Former US Ambassador to Ukraine on Trump comments about her to Zelenskyy: 'it sounded like a threat'</h4>
      <p>Former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch has said that comments made by President Trump about her to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ukraine.html">Ukraine</a>'s leader in a phone call at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry "sounded like a threat".</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch, testifying on Friday in the second public hearing in the investigation, was read the comments made in the July 25 phone call by Daniel Goldman, the lawyer for the committee Democrats. During the call, Trump said Yovanovitch was "bad news" and that she's going to "go through some things".</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch said a colleague told her the blood had drained from her face when she first read a memo of the call. </p>
      <p>"It was a terrible moment," she said. "I think I even had a physical reaction, even now words kind of fail me."</p>
      <p>When asked what she made of Trump's "bad news" comment, Yovanovitch said she was "shocked, appalled, devastated, that the president of the United States would talk about any ambassador like that to a head of state, and it was me, I couldn't believe it".</p>
      <p>Goldman then asked Yovanovitch about Trump's statement that she was going to "go through some things".</p>
      <p>"I didn't know what to think, but I was very concerned. 'she's gonna go through some things'. It didn't sound good. It sounded like a threat," she said. </p>
      <h4>In tweet, Trump attacks former Ambassador Yovanovitch as she testifies in impeachment investigation</h4>
      <p>President Donald Trump has tweeted an attack against the former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch while she was in the middle of testifying in his impeachment investigation, saying everything she touched went "bad". <br/><br/>The president's response came as Yovanovitch testified in the House of Representatives about her abrupt firing from her post in Ukraine following an alleged smear campaign by Trump's allies. <br/><br/>"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad," Trump said, finishing his tweet with a reminder that presidents have the "absolute right" to hire and fire ambassadors.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Trump said on Wednesday he did not watch the first public hearing in the investigation, but tweeted a livestream during the hearing on Friday. </p>
      <h4>Former Ambassador Yovanovitch: corrupt Ukrainians found Americans 'willing to partner with them'</h4>
      <p>The former US ambassador to Ukraine told a public impeachment hearing of President Donald Trump on Friday that corrupt Ukrainians found Americans willing to work with them to oust her.</p>
      <p>Marie Yovanovitch told the US House Intelligence Committee that not all Ukrainians "embraced" US anti-corruption work in the country.</p>
      <p>"Thus, perhaps, it was not surprising, that when our anti-corruption efforts got in the way of a desire for profit or power, Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old, corrupt rules sought to remove me," Yovanovitch said in her opening statement.</p>
      <p>"What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and, working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a US ambassador," she added, in apparent reference to the president's personal lawyer, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/trump-lawyer-rudy-giuliani-191002171637752.html">Rudy Giuliani</a>, who led a campaign to depose her. </p>
      <p>Yovanovitch said her removal has the potential to undermine US diplomats around the world. </p>
      <p>"Shady interests the world over have learned how little it takes to remove a US Ambassador who does not give them what they want," she said. </p>
      <p>She added she was "disappointed" that the State Department leadership did not acknowledge that attacks against her were "dangerously wrong".</p>
      <p>"These events should concern everyone in this room," she said, adding that the agency is being "hollowed out from within".</p>
      <h4>White House releases memo of an April phone call between Trump and Zelenskyy</h4>
      <p>The White House has released a summary of an April phone call in which President Donald Trump congratulated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shortly after his election win.</p>
      <p>Trump had said repeatedly that Democrats wanted details of his April 21 call with Zelenskyy, but it has never been a focus of the lawmakers leading the impeachment investigation of Trump on Capitol Hill.</p>
      <p>A separate call between the two leaders on July 25 sparked the impeachment inquiry. </p>
      <p>Trump, in the April call, invited Zelenskyy to the White House.</p>
      <p>"We'll have a lot of things to talk about, but we're with you all the way," he said according to the memo.</p>

      <h4>Ranking committee Republican derides inquiry, does not mention Yovanovitch in opening statements</h4>
      <p>The ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, decried the Democrat-lead House inquiry into US Presidential Donald Trump in his opening statements in the second public hearing of the investigation. </p>
      <p>Nunes did not comment on former Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/ousted-ambassador-yovanovitch-testify-impeachment-probe-191115130056141.html">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, who sat before him as she prepared to testify before the committee on Friday.</p>
      <p>Nunes instead said the legislators had convened for another day of the "Democrats day long TV spectacle" which he said distracted from "solving the problems we all came to Washington to address".</p>
      <p>He said that Democrats were holding Friday's public hearing to "advance their operation to topple a duly elected president".</p>
      <p>Nunes went on to describe Wednesday's testimony, the first public hearing in the investigation, as "hours of hearsay testimony".</p>
      <p>He finished his testimony by reading a transcript of an April phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, which the White House released on Friday. </p>
      <h4>In opening statements, Schiff calls Yovanovitch anti-corruption 'champion' who got in the way of Trump's 'personal and political' agenda</h4>
      <p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has described the former US Ambassador to Ukraine as a career diplomat whose anti-corruption work got in the way of the president's 'personal and political' agenda. </p>
      <p>In his opening statements during the second public hearing of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Schiff described former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch as an "exemplary officer who is widely praised and respected by her colleagues" and an "anti-corruption champion".</p>
      <p>She said Yovanovitch's anti-corruption work didn't just rankle "corrupt Ukrainians...but also certain Americans" like the president's personal attorney <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/trump-lawyer-rudy-giuliani-191002171637752.html">Rudy Giuliani</a> and his associates.</p>
      <p>"Why did Rudy Giuliani want her gone? And why did Trump?" Schiff said.</p>
      <p>He said Yovanovitch was "considered an obstacle to furtherance of the presidents personal and political agenda, for that she was smeared and cast aside".</p>

      <h4>Trump cites Ukrainian foreign minister in tweet decrying inquiry</h4>
      <p>Minutes before the second public hearing in the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump began, the president that statements made by Ukraine's foreign minister the night prior should absolve him of any wrongdoing. </p>
      <p>Trump was referring to comments made by Vadym Prystaiko, the foreign minister of Ukraine, who said last night US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland did not explicitly link withheld military aid to investigations pushed by the president. </p>
      <p>"Ambassador Sondland did not tell us, and certainly did not tell me, about a connection between the assistance and the investigations. You should ask him," Prystaiko said about Sondland.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Trump tweeted on Friday that "the impeachment witch hunt should be over" following the foreign minister's statements. </p>

      <p>The former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify publicly in the House impeachment investigation of US President Donald Trump. </p>
      <p>Yovanovitch, who had previously testified in private that she had become the target of an apparent smear campaign by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and his associates, did not respond to reporters questions as she passed through security. </p>
      <h4>Former US Ambassador Yovanovitch to testify in impeachment investigation</h4>

      <h3>Wednesday, November 13 - William Taylor and George Kent </h3>
      <h4>Trump denies asking about investigations on call</h4>
      <p>President Donald Trump denied he asked a US ambassador about "investigations" in Ukraine a day after his call with that country's president.</p>
      <p>The existence of the call was revealed Wednesday by William Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine. He testified that one of his staffers overheard Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, speaking on the phone with Trump on July 26.</p>
      <p>Sondland used his cellphone to call Trump, and the staff member could hear Trump on the phone asking about "the investigations".</p>
      <p>Trump denied knowledge of the call, saying, "I know nothing about that." He adds, "First time I've heard it."</p>
      <p>An official familiar with the matter said the staffer Taylor referred to is David Holmes, the political counselor at the embassy in Kyiv. Holmes is invited to testify before Congress on Friday.</p>
      <h4>House intelligence committee votes to table motion to subpoena whistle-blower</h4>
      <p>The House intelligence committee has voted 13 to 9 to vote on subpoenaing the whistle-blower at a later date. </p>
      <p>Republicans had repeatedly called on House Republicans leading the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/190926061142695.html">impeachment investigation</a> to call the whistle-blower to testify during the investigations first public hearing on Wednesday. </p>
      <p>Representative Mike Conaway, a Republican, had introduced the motion to subpoena the whistle-blower at the beginning of the hearing. </p>
      <h4>Hearing ends with Schiff reiterating he has never met with whistle-blower</h4>
      <p>Top State Department official George Kent and US Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor have been dismissed from the first public hearing as part of the House <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/190926061142695.html">impeachment investigation</a> into President Donald Trump. </p>
      <p>Taylor Kent testified for more than five hours Wednesday about their concerns with Trump's requests that Ukraine investigate Democrats as the US withheld military aid to the country.</p>
      <p>Next up will be former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/envoy-ukraine-defies-trump-testifies-pushed-oust-191011192008363.html">removed</a> in May on Trump's orders. She will testify Friday</p>
      <p>In his closing statement, Adam Schiff, the Democrat leading the investigation, again denied Republican claims that he had met with the whistle-blower, whose complaint over a July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president sparked the investigation. </p>
      <p>"It was false the first time they said it," he said. "It will be false the last time they said it."</p>
      <h4>House Republican says the whistleblower is the 'one witness' who should be brought in front of the American people</h4>
      <p>Jim Jordan, a Republican representative, said the whistle-blower at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry is the "one witness" who should be brought in front of the American people.</p>
      <p>Jordan said the whistle-blower, whose complaint touched off the inquiry, should come before the committee.</p>
      <p>He said he wanted to know the identity of the whistle-blower, who is a CIA officer assigned to the White House.</p>
      <p>Jordan earlier complained that the witnesses Wednesday testifying publicly for the first time didn't have firsthand knowledge of the accusations and never spoke directly to President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower has not been asked to testify.</p>
      <p>Representative Peter Welch, a Democrat, said he'd be glad to have the person at the centre of the investigation testify.</p>
      <p>"President Trump is welcome to sit right there," he said. </p>
      <h4>Kent, Taylor deny they are 'never Trumpers'</h4>
      <p>George Kent and William Taylor, the two veteran diplomats testifying in the House impeachment hearing, have denied President Donald Trump's accusation that they adamantly oppose him.</p>
      <p>Shortly before Wednesday's House Intelligence Committee hearing began, Trump tweeted, "NEVER TRUMPERS!" He offered no evidence.</p>
      <p>Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat, asked both men if Trump's claim was true.</p>
      <p>State Department official George Kent responded that he's served under three Republican and two Democratic presidents during his 27 years of service. He said he serves "whatever president is duly elected" and carries out their foreign policies.</p>
      <p>William Taylor answered, "No sir". Taylor is the top US diplomat in Ukraine and was recruited by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to serve there.</p>

      <h4>Democrats, Republicans question Taylor and Kent</h4>
      <p>Democratic and Republican House intelligence committee members questioned William Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, in a rapid-fire sequence as part of the first public hearing into the House impeachment inquiry. </p>
      <p>The questioning came after both sides were given 45-minute sessions, which they used for in-depth questioning by appointed lawyers. Committee members were then given five minutes for questioning, which Republicans largely used to portray the testimonies of Kent and Taylor as "hearsay". </p>

      <p>In one exchange, Republican committee member Jim Jordan asked if Taylor was on the July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskyy, if he had spoken with Trump's chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, or ever met the president. Taylor responded in the negative to all.</p>
      <p>"And you're their star witness. You're their first witness. You're the guy, you're the guy. Based on this, based on this. I've seen church prayer chains that are easier to understand than this," Jordan said, portraying Taylor's source of information as convoluted. </p>
      <p>"I don't consider myself a star witness for anything," Taylor said.</p>
      <h4>Top Senate Republican says any motion to immediately dismiss impeachment charges in Senate would likely fail </h4>
      <p>Top Senate Republican John Cornyn said on Wednesday that should the House vote to impeach President Donald Trump, he doubts a motion in the Senate to immediately dismiss the charges would succeed.</p>
      <p>Cornyn, who spent years as the Senate's number two Republican, said such a motion would not receive the 51 votes necessary in the Republican-controlled Senate to pass.</p>
      <p>He added he was confident that ultimately, a vote in the Senate to remove Trump from office would fail.</p>
      <h4>Report: Pelosi urges Democrats not to be distracted by 'Republican disruption'</h4>
      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged House Democrats not to be distracted by "Republican disruption" in meeting shortly before the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, the Washington Post reported. </p>
      <p>"I do think that we need to have a common narrative," Pelosi said, according to a Democratic aide, the newspaper reported. "This is a very serious event in our country. We wish it could have been avoided. None of us came here to impeach a president."</p>
      <p>The aide added Pelosi said it was 'a prayerful day for all of us - for our country", according to the report.</p>

      <h4>Trump calls impeachment inquiry hearing a 'witch hunt' and a 'hoax'</h4>
      <p>President Donald Trump said Wednesday he skipped the first <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/trump-impeachment-inquiry-enter-phase-public-hearings-191113110048615.html">public hearings</a> in his impeachment investigation because he was "too busy."</p>
      <p>"I'm too busy to watch it. It's a witch hunt, it's a hoax, I'm too busy to watch it. So, I'm sure I'll get a report," Trump told reporters.</p>
      <p>Trump was, however, active on Twitter during the beginning of the hearing, retweeting many House Republicans critical of the inquiry. </p>
      <h4>Taylor describes two US policy channels operating within Ukraine</h4>
      <p>The top US diplomat to Ukraine William Taylor told House legislators conducting an impeachment investigation that he noticed there were two policy channels operating with Ukraine, a "regular" and an "irregular" one.</p>
      <p>William Taylor said the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was guiding requests through the irregular channel.</p>
      <p>Taylor also reiterated his previous statement, which he made in a closed-door hearing, that it slowly became clear to him that a White House meeting desired by Ukrainian officials was conditioned on investigations into the gas company linked to Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US elections.</p>

      <h4>Spokeswoman: Trump not watching public impeachment inquiry hearings</h4>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> is not watching the public House <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/trump-impeachment-inquiry-enter-phase-public-hearings-191113110048615.html">impeachment hearings</a> against him, Stephanie Grisham, the president's chief spokeswoman, said.</p>
      <p>Grisham told reporters that Trump is instead participating in meetings in the Oval Office. Trump was also scheduled to receive the Turkish president at 12pm (17:00 GMT).</p>
      <p>"He's in the Oval (office) in meetings. Not watching. He's working," Stephanie Grisham said more than an hour into the public hearing.</p>
      <p>Trump was, however, retweeting House Republican tweets about the hearing during the proceedings.</p>

      <h4>Taylor says it was 'crazy' and 'illogical' for Trump to withhold aid in exchange for investigations</h4>
      <p>The US Ambassador to Ukraine said he thought it was "crazy" and "illogical" for the Trump administration to make military aid contingent on Ukraine announcing investigations into political rival Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>William Taylor made the statements in response to questioning from Daniel Goldman, the investigations chief for Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
      <p>Taylor said the security assistance was important not only to Ukraine but to America's own military interests. He said "it made no sense" to withhold that money and was "counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do".</p>
      <p>Goldman showed Taylor text messages he sent to other diplomats explaining his belief that it was "crazy" to withhold the military aid for political gain.</p>
      <h4>In new disclosure, diplomat Taylor says staff overheard Trump ask Sondland about 'the investigations'</h4>
      <p>The US Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/diplomat-clear-understanding-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-191106201115453.html">William Taylor</a> saida member of his staff recently told him they overheard President Donald Trump speaking on the phone to US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about "investigations". </p>
      <p>Taylor made the disclosure in his opening statements as he testified publicly in the House impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>He said the staff member was at a restaurant with Sondland on the day after the July 25 call between Trump and the new leader of Ukraine. That call later prompted a whistle-blower's complaint that lead to the launch of the inquiry.</p>
      <p>Taylor told the committee that Sondland called Trump from the restaurant and the staff could hear Trump on the phone asking about "the investigations".</p>
      <p>Sondland, a hotelier who was appointed to the prestigious post by Trump, responded to the president that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward, Taylor said. </p>
      <p>The staff member then asked Sondland about Trump's thoughts on Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Sondland replied that "Trump cared more about the investigations of Biden" than Ukraine itself, Taylor testified. </p>
      <h4>Kent says he never saw any effort by US officials to shield company linked to Hunter Biden from scrutiny</h4>
      <p>Top State Department official George Kent said he never saw any effort by US officials to shield from scrutiny a Ukrainian natural gas company on which Hunter Biden sat on the board.</p>
      <p>Kent said he raised concerns in 2015 that his status could create the perception of a conflict of interest. But, he added, he never saw any attempt to shield Burisma from scrutiny because of Biden's connection to the company.</p>
      <p>During the hearing, House Republicans portrayed Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate Burisma as a legitimate concern in a general anti-corruption push by the president. </p>
      <h4>Kent: US should not ask other countries to engage in 'selective, politically associated investigations'</h4>
      <p>George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, has said the US shouldn't engage in "selective, politically associated investigations" during his opening statement during the first public hearing of the House impeachment inquiry. </p>
      <p>Kent said such "selective actions" undermine the rule of law regardless of the country.</p>
      <p>He then apparently referenced a campaign by President Donald Trump's personal lawyer <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/rudy-giuliani-focus-trump-impeachment-inquiry-191017174401257.html">Rudy Giuliani</a> to oust former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>"It was unexpected, and most unfortunate, to watch some Americans - including those who allied themselves with corrupt Ukrainians in pursuit of private agendas - launch attacks on dedicated public servants advancing US interests in Ukraine," he said. </p>
      <p>"In my opinion, those attacks undermined US and Ukrainian national interest and damage our critical bilateral relationship," he said.</p>

      <h4>House Republicans push to hear from whistle-blower</h4>
      <p>House Republicans at the start of the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's immediately pushed Democrats to hear from the anonymous whistleblower whose <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/190926130726931.html">complaint</a> sparked the investigation.</p>
      <p>Congressman Michael Conaway, a Republican from Texas, asked that the panel issue a subpoena for the still-unknown whistleblower to appear in a closed-door hearing.</p>
      <p>But Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, denied the request Wednesday, saying it would be considered later.</p>
      <p>"We will do everything necessary to protect the whistleblower's identity," Schiff said.</p>

      <h4>Schiff opens first public hearing in impeachment investigation</h4>
      <p>Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff has opened the first public hearing in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/190926061142695.html">impeachment inquiry</a>into President Donald Trump, saying the investigation will determine what "conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander-in-chief".</p>

      <p>In his opening statement, Schiff said that Democrats believe the testimonies will answer whether Trump "abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, or if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign". </p>
      <p>"If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?" he said. </p>
      <p>Schiff added there were still "missing pieces" in the inquiry, as a result of the White House's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/white-house-refuses-cooperation-impeachment-probe-191009040900155.html">refusal</a> to cooperate in the investigation. He said the refusal will force the House to consider whether Trump's "obstruction of the constitutional duties of Congress constitute additional grounds for impeachment".</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, offered a conflicting narrative in his opening statement, portraying the inquiry as a "carefully orchestrated media smear campaign" and the public hearing as a "televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats".</p>
      <p>Addressing William Taylor and George Kent directly, Nunes said: "It seems you agreed wittingly or unwittingly to participate in a drama".</p>
      <h4>Kremlin weighs in on Trump impeachment hearings</h4>
      <p>The Kremlin has drawn a parallel between the impeachment proceedings against Trump and accusations of Russia's interference in his election.</p>
      <p>Asked about the hearings opening Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded that "there are a lot of things far-fetched".</p>
      <p>Peskov compared the proceedings to the US claims of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, which he described as having "little relation to reality". </p>
      <p>The Kremlin has shrugged off special counsel Robert Mueller's exposure of Russian interference in the vote.</p>
      <p>Mueller found there wasn't enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia. But Mueller charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with breaking into Democratic Party computers and the email accounts of officials with Hillary Clinton's campaign.</p>
      <h4>What to expect from the first public hearings</h4>
      <p>Republicans and Democrats in Congress are competing to sell their own very different narratives in the impeachment process. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/republican-party.html">Republicans</a> are calling the witness testimony hearsay and arguing that while some may conclude Trump did, in fact, push Ukraine for political investigations that do not warrant impeachment.</p>

      <p>Schiff told the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a>'s National Public Radio (NPR) on Tuesday that he believes Trump committed a form of "bribery" that rises to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanours" defined in the Constitution as impeachable offences.</p>
      <p>"Bribery, first of all, as the founders understood bribery it was not as we understand it in law today. It was much broader," Schiff told NPR. "It connoted the breach of the public trust in a way where you're offering official acts for some personal or political reason, not in the nation's interest."</p>
