      <h1>Big Machine Records Denies Blocking Taylor Swift From Her Music, Gets Shot Down Immediately</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:16:40+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:16</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://junkee.com/dont-know-what-else-to-do-taylor-swift-shares-open-letter-about-battle-with-scooter-braun/230036">Taylor Swift accused Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun of throwing roadblocks in the way of her career.</a></p>
      <p>According to a statement posted to her Twitter page, the two men were making it impossible for her to use her own back catalogue, blocking its appearance in both<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/big-machine-taylor-swift-ama-netflix-controversy-913176/"> a new Netflix documentary</a> and in a performance at the American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>In the statement, Swift asked her fans to let Borchetta and Braun know what they thought of the deal — which they did, en masse, flooding the mentions of both men with the rat emoji and with stern reminders that it is not a good idea to attempt to limit a woman’s autonomy.</p>

      <p>In response, Big Machine Group — Borchetta’s record label — has issued a statement, accusing Swift of endangering the lives of the company’s employees, and creating a false narrative.</p>
      <p>“At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special,” goes the statement. “In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere.</p>
      <p>“However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families.”</p>
      <p>Then, in summation, the statement threw the blame solely onto Swift’s shoulders. “Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side. To date, not one of the invitations to speak with us and work through this has been accepted.”</p>
      <p>Hours later, Swift’s publicist, Tree Paine, offered the other side of the story.</p>

      <p>According to Paine, a staff member from Big Machine explicitly said the company would “not agree to issue licences for existing recordings or waivers” in connection with the documentary or the concert.</p>
      <p>“Please notice,” Paine wrote, “in Big Machine’s statement they never actually deny either claim Taylor said last night in her post.”</p>
      <p>Big Machine has yet to respond.</p>
