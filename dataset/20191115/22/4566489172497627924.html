      <p>The resignation of Bolivia's Evo Morales and his replacement by a little known conservative senator has sparked a surge of misleading social media posts.</p>
      <p>Here's a selection of misinformation debunked by AFP's fact-check service.</p>
      <p>- Morales and 'friends' -</p>
      <p>A black and white photo shared thousands of times on social media purports to show Morales with drug lords Pablo Escobar and Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman: <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVYb%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3EThe">http://u.afp.com/JVYb</a></p>
      <p>The photo is a composite of three separate pictures.</p>
      <p>Several reverse searches of images turned up this picture of Escobar: <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVYE%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3EMany">http://u.afp.com/JVYE</a></p>
      <p>Many websites have this picture of a smiling El Chapo, exactly as he appears in the composite: <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVYR%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3EThis">http://u.afp.com/JVYR</a></p>
      <p>This photo of Morales with a woman, taken in 2017, shows him exactly as he appears in the fake photo: <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVYD%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E-">http://u.afp.com/JVYD</a></p>
      <p>- Anez's tweets-</p>
      <p>Since taking over as Bolivia's new interim president on November 12, stories have circulated that Jeanine Anez, a bible-brandishing conservative Christian, deleted old tweets criticizing indigenous people, including one in which she described Morales's Aymara community as "satanists".</p>
      <p>Screen captures of what were purported to be old tweets were circulated on social networks.</p>
      <p>AFP's fact checkers found one of these tweets to be false, but three of the tweets had indeed been erased by Anez.</p>
      <p>One of the deleted tweets, marking the Aymara New Year, says: "Hopefully the Aymara new year won't see the light of day. Satanists, no one can replace God!"</p>
      <p>Questioned about these messages, Anez accused the Morales administration of using "digital warriors" to falsify twitter accounts.</p>
      <p>"I've seen a couple of tweets I've never written," she said, without explaining which ones they were.</p>
      <p>- Gunship shooting -</p>
      <p>A night-time video showing a helicopter firing on what appear to be homes went viral, with a ticker describing it as a military attack on civilians in Bolivia: <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVYH%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3EIn">http://u.afp.com/JVYH</a></p>
      <p>In reality, the video is of a February 2017 gunbattle in the western Mexican state of Nayarit between members of a drug cartel and Mexican federal forces: <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVYV%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E-">http://u.afp.com/JVYV</a></p>
      <p>- Ole, ole, ole... Evo, Evo? -</p>
      <p>A celebrating crowd sing and chant in a widely shared video purporting to show Morales being greeted with cries of "Evo, Evo" on his November 12 arrival at Mexico City airport: <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVYn%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3EHowever">http://u.afp.com/JVYn</a></p>
      <p>However, the sequence was in fact recorded on August 13, when Club America soccer fans welcoming goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa shouting "Ole, ole, ole, Memo, Memo": <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVY8%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E-">http://u.afp.com/JVY8</a></p>
      <p>- Morales 'brother' -</p>
      <p>A video shared 30,000 times on social networks since November 10 purports to show Evo Morales' brother aboard a plane being insulted by other passengers: <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVYu%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3EHowever">http://u.afp.com/JVYu</a></p>
      <p>However, the video, dating from 2016, in fact shows an incident involving Carlos Zannini, a former Argentine government official: <a href="http://u.afp.com/JVYL%3C/p%3E">http://u.afp.com/JVYL</a></p>
