      <p>DHL Express, the world’s leading international express service provider, has officially inaugurated its first Airbus A300-600 freight aircraft dedicated to servicing the Visayas and Mindanao (VisMin) regions in the Philippines. Previously serviced by commercial flights, international shipments that are consolidated in Cebu will now be taken care of by this dedicated freight aircraft operating five times a week.</p>
      <p>“With the Visayas and Mindanao regions expected to perform above the national growth average, VisMin is a bright spot for DHL Express Philippines as we continue to invest in the country and improve our service offerings to our customers,” said Nurhayati Abdullah, DHL Express Philippines Country Manager.<br/>“Our dedicated flight to Cebu will further differentiate DHL Express as the only integrator with a gateway and Customs clearance capability in this major city, and greatly enhance our service excellence with increased aircraft capacity, stable uplift capability and better transit time for last mile deliveries to our customers in key cities like Bacolod, Iloilo and General Santos.”</p>
      <p>Apart from catering to businesses in the manufacturing sector, overseas Filipino workers and their families, and micro, small, medium entrepreneurs based in the VisMin regions, this service enhancement also benefits businesses in the local e-commerce sector, which is expected to grow more than 30% in 2019.</p>
      <p>The inbound aircraft traversing the Hong Kong-Manila-Cebu route arrives two hours earlier than the commercial flights used previously, allowing urgent documents and parcels to reach their recipients earlier. The outbound aircraft departing in the evening provides overnight connections to key Asian countries and next-day delivery to other parts of the world.</p>
      <p>Co-owned by AHK Air Hong Kong Limited and Cathay Pacific, the aircraft is one of eight cargo planes that DHL bought from Air Hong Kong and leased back to the carrier as part of a 15-year agreement to support rapid growth of DHL in the Asia Pacific region. The aircraft deployment also forms the latest stage of DHL’s ongoing investments in its air freight infrastructure to transform its Asia Pacific network and provide DHL Express Philippines’ customers with continuous improvements on the service quality that they have come to rely on.</p>
