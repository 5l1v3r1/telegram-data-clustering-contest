      <h1>‘A badge of honor’: Biden welcomes North Korea calling him a ‘rabid dog’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:37:24+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:37</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>2020 Democrat Joe Biden jabbed both Kim Jong Un and President Trump in response to North Korea’s state-run media calling him a “rabid dog.”</p>
      <p>Korean Central News Agency, a state-run propaganda outlet, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/north-korea-says-biden-is-a-rabid-dog-who-must-be-beaten-to-death">smeared Biden as a “rabid dog”</a> that must be “beaten to death with a stick” this week. Biden, 76, took North Korea’s threats to be a “badge of honor.”</p>
      <p>"It seems that murderous dictator Kim Jong Un doesn't like me. Add him to the list of autocrats who don't want me to be president — right next to Vladimir Putin. I wear their insults as a badge of honor," the former vice president said in a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/470715-biden-responds-to-north-korea-i-wear-their-insults-as-a-badge-of-honor">statement</a> released by his campaign Friday.</p>
      <p>He then pivoted to bash Trump’s relationship with Kim, saying, “There will be no love letters in a Biden administration.”</p>
      <p>Trump and Kim have been in negotiations to denuclearize North Korea but have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/north-korea-conducts-missile-test-a-day-after-announcing-weekend-talks-with-us">not had success</a> in removing missiles. In August, Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-kim-jong-un-sent-him-a-really-beautiful-letter">claimed to have received</a> a "really beautiful letter" from the dictator after North Korea fired off several ballistic missiles.</p>
      <p>"When I am commander in chief, our adversaries will know that America doesn't embrace dictators. All Trump has accomplished is emboldening Kim and endangering our allies,” Biden said. “Kim would love to see Trump reelected, as would the rest of America's adversaries. That's just one more reason it's so important we beat him next November.”</p>
      <p>North Korea has not denuclearized, but Trump has had some victories in his negotiations, including the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/north-korea-to-release-3-american-prisoners-in-good-faith-gesture-for-trump-summit">release of American prisoners</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/us-prepares-for-return-of-troop-remains-from-north-korea">return of the remains</a> of American prisoners of war.</p>
