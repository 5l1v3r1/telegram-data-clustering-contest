      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> said he has ‘let the side down’ over his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>In a ‘no holds barred’ interview with BBC Two’s Newsnight programme, the Duke of York said his stay at the home of Epstein was not ‘becoming of a member of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/royal-family/">Royal Family</a>’.</p>
      <p>During the interview, filmed at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/buckingham-palace/">Buckingham Palace</a> on Thursday, the duke faced questions about his links with the disgraced financier who was found dead in a New York jail cell in August.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old was being held on sex trafficking charges at the time of his death.</p>

      <p>The duke said his ongoing relationship with Epstein, following his release from an 18-month prison term, ‘let the side down’ for the royal family.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘I stayed with him … and that’s the bit that … I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.’</p>
      <p>The Duke of York also claimed in the interview that he has ‘no recollection’ of meeting the woman who said she was forced to have a sexual encounter with him at the age of 17.</p>
      <p>Virginia Giuffre is one of 16 women who say they were abused by Epstein and has previously claimed in court that she was forced to have sex with the duke.</p>
      <p>Andrew told the BBC: ‘I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.’</p>

      <p>Presenter Emily Maitlis probed the duke over claims made by Mrs Giuffre that ‘she met you in 2001, she says she dined with you, danced with you at Tramp Nightclub in London. She went on to have sex with you in a house in Belgravia’.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis added: ‘You don’t remember meeting her?’, to which Andrew replied: ‘No.’</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre’s allegations were struck from US civil court records in 2015 after a judge said they were ‘immaterial and impertinent’.</p>

      <p>Buckingham Palace has branded the allegations ‘false and without any foundation’ and said ‘any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors’ by the duke was ‘categorically untrue’.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis said on Twitter it was a ‘no holds barred’ and ‘no questions vetted’ interview – it will be the first time the duke has answered questions on his relationship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>In 2015, he used a public appearance at Davos in Switzerland to deny the claims.</p>
      <p>The full interview, Prince Andrew And The Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview, will air on BBC Two at 9pm on Saturday.</p>
