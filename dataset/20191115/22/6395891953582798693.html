      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - A judge has set a sentencing date for next month for former Trump campaign official Rick Gates.</p>
      <p>U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson scheduled the sentencing for the morning of December 17 in Washington's federal court.</p>
      <p>Gates pleaded guilty in February 2018 in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation on charges arising from political consulting work in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>He has cooperated extensively with prosecutors since then. The scheduling of a sentencing hearing signals that his cooperation has ended.</p>
      <p>Gates testified most recently in the trial of another Trump associate Roger Stone, who was found guilty Friday of lying to Congress, obstruction justice and witness tampering.</p>
