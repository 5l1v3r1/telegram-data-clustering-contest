      <h1>Maurkice Pouncey Has Message For Mason Rudolph After Brawl</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:49:11+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers will be without All-Pro offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey as a result of his role in a brawl that broke out during Thursday night’s game against the Cleveland Browns.</p>
      <p>Pouncey received a three-game suspension for punching and kicking Browns defensive end Myles Garrett – who hit Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph with his own helmet.</p>
      <p>All of the headlines centered around Garrett – and for good reason – but fans and former players loved how Pouncey stood up for his quarterback. It might have cost him three games, but it looks like Pouncey is okay with the suspension as well.</p>
      <p>He took to Instagram on Friday afternoon with a message for Rudolph.</p>
      <p>“👊🏽🤣🤷🏾‍♂️,” he captioned the photo.</p>

      <p>Pouncey reportedly plans to appeal his suspension, but it’s unlikely to drop below two games. The NFL likely doesn’t want Pouncey on the field when the Steelers face off against the Browns in two weeks.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh holds a one-game lead over Cleveland in the division, but both teams are staring up at the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
      <p>The Steelers and Browns have two of the easiest schedules in the NFL over the final six games of the season. Can they contend for a playoff spot?</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
