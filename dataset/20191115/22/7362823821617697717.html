      <p>The first came when Yim was holding a ladder to her face when Shirai launched a drop kick in her direction.</p>
      <p>The ladder smashed off her face and bust open her nose.</p>
      <p>With blood streaming down her face the show continued but it was about to get worse for Yim.</p>

      <p>As she climbed the top of the ladder, NXT UK Women's Champion Kay Lee Ray tipped it over leaving her sprawling.</p>

      <p>AN NXT injury report claimed: "Mia Yim suffered a nasal fracture during her Ladder Match loss to Io Shirai, after Shirai dropkicked the ladder into her face.</p>
      <p>"That injury will be examined by a plastic surgery. Yim also suffered what were believed to be rib fractures due to the big fall she took at the end of the match.</p>
