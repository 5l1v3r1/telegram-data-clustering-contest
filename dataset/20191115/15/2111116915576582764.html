      <h3>Xiaomi has a bold plan to make 5G phones affordable in 2020</h3>
      <p>Lots of 5G phones at low prices</p>

      <p>Xiaomi could soon be one of the biggest smartphone players in 5G, as following on from a claim that it would <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/2020-could-be-5gs-breakthrough-year-as-xiaomi-promises-a-whopping-ten-phones">launch at least 10 5G handsets</a> next year, the company has now said that all its 2020 smartphones of over CNY2,000 (around $285 / £220 / AU$420) will support 5G.</p>
      <p>That claim comes direct from Xiaomi’s CEO, Lei Jun, who said as much during a keynote speech in Guangzhou, China, according to CNMO.</p>
      <p>The move could make <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/5g-phones-what-are-the-first-5g-phones">5G phones</a> far more accessible and affordable than they are now, as Xiaomi will be offering a variety of handsets to choose from, offering 5G phones at lower price points than they are currently available.</p>

        <li>Xiaomi might also <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/xiaomi-could-have-a-clamshell-foldable-phone-to-rival-the-motorola-razr">launch one or more foldable phones</a></li>

      </ul>
      <h4>Lowering costs</h4>
      <p>Right now, most 5G phone have flagship price tags. The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a90-5g">Samsung Galaxy A90 5G</a> is one of the most affordable, and even than costs £669 (around $860 / AU$1,270) to buy SIM-free.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi for its part already offers a few 5G phones, such as the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-mix-3-5g">Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 5G</a> and the wraparound <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-with-an-insane-wrap-around-screen">Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha</a>, but its selection is a lot more limited than it sounds like it soon will be.</p>
      <p>It’s not just Xiaomi which could make a big 5G push in 2020 though. It’s likely that Apple will finally add 5G to the iPhone range – possibly to all three rumored <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-iphone-12">iPhone 12</a> models, while Samsung and other companies are also likely to offer a growing number of 5G handsets.</p>
