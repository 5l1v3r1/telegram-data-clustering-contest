      <h1>Sven Mislintat's comments on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang offer Arsenal hope amid Barcelona links</h1>
      <h2>Barcelona are reportedly eyeing a move for the Arsenal striker</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:48:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona are eyeing a January move for Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang according to reports.</p>
      <p>With Arsenal struggling to keep pace in the race for a Champions League spot and Aubameyang yet to commit his future to the club, the La Liga have been linked with a bid for the forward.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang, who was appointed as the new Arsenal captain to replace Granit Xhaka, has been linked with a move to Spain as both Real Madrid and Barcelona look to bolster their attacking options.</p>
      <p>And according to outlet <a href="https://twitter.com/elchiringuitotv">El Chiringuito</a> , the Gabon forward is on Barcelona's radar as a potential replacement for Luis Suarez as the Uruguayan approaches the latter stages of his career.</p>
      <p>Barca's summer signing Antoine Griezmann is also struggling for form, which could push head coach Ernesto Valverde to contemplate a January move for Aubameyang.</p>
      <p>But former Arsenal transfer chief Sven Mislintat previously suggested his selfless attitude might not be a good fit at Real Madrid or Barcelona.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1283326/2019/10/11/look-beyond-the-garish-clothes-and-fast-cars-aubameyang-is-an-absolute-team-player-who-should-be-arsenal-captain/?redirected=1">Speaking to The Athletic</a>, he said: "He is one, possibly the only one, of these extraordinary top, top, top strikers who is an absolute team player.</p>
      <p>"A striker like Neymar or (Sergio) Aguero, for example, would never give a penalty to Pepe to score his first goal. It’s vice versa — ‘Come on, <i>I</i> will take this penalty kick, nobody else!’ Auba gave the chance to Pepe.</p>
      <p>"His instinct was, ‘Let’s score and let’s go forward together.’ He takes care about his team-mates.</p>
      <p>“Since he joined Arsenal, he played where he was asked and needed, and so he helped especially Lacazette to adapt to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"Maybe this attitude costs him to play for clubs like Real Madrid or Barcelona but maybe they made a mistake not to go for him. I like his mindset. It is good for a team’s atmosphere."</p>
