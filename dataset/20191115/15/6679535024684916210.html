      <p>“The AIADMK will see a massive victory in the ensuing local body polls. We are confident after the mandate given by the people in the byelections held recently,” said, Minister for Forests, Dindigul C. Srinivasan, at the party’s office here on Friday, where applications from interested candidates were received across the district to contest in the local body polls.</p>
      <p>The Minister blamed DMK president M. K. Stalin for the delay in the local body elections. “Stalin has been talking against the government unnecessarily. He is the reason for the local body elections not taking place since the past three years,” he alleged. He said that the transfer of bureaucrats across the State is for administrative purposes and has nothing to do with the elections.</p>
      <p>“There’s no void in Tamil Nadu politics, as Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has been steering ahead the State in the path of development,” he said.</p>
      <p>M. Ponmuthu, daughter of V. Marudharaj, former mayor of Dindigul corporation, who is contesting for the post of Mayor, submitted her papers.</p>
      <h3>DMK receives applications</h3>
      <p>The DMK party functionaries also commenced receiving applications from aspirants, who were interested to contest the local body elections. In the presence of senior leader and deputy secretary I. Periasami, party cadre enthusiastically submitted applications for various posts including the Mayoral seat.</p>
      <p>The DMK members said that they would win hands down in the civic polls as the people were upset with the AIADMK’s performance. Nothing in the wards, municipalities and panchayats were happening. Public were agitated over the nonchalant attitude of the ruling party. The DMK, led by M. K. Stalin, would bring back the golden rule of late Karunanidhi and by delivering the power to the people, the essence of Panchayat Raj would be seen, the members added.</p>
