      <p>Residents have been warned to remain vigilant due to high river levels and flooding after heavy rain caused disruption across large parts of Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>The wet weather created travel disruption on Friday morning, with road closures in place and rail services being delayed or cancelled.</p>
      <p>Trains running from Nottingham to Derby were cancelled for much of Friday due to the flooding.</p>
      <p>Flood <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/live-updates-roads-buses-friday-3540623">warnings remain along the River Trent on Friday, November 15 including at Collingham, Lenton and Newark.</a></p>
      <p>And the Environment Agency is asking people to be vigilant in the coming days as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather">river levels</a> on the Trent remain high.</p>

      <p>This is due to recent high levels of rain moving down the river to its mouth in the Humber Estuary.</p>
      <p>More than 40 roads were closed across Nottinghamshire on Friday including the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/traffic-travel">A52</a> Radcliffe Road and the A617 Kirklington Road.</p>
      <p>Nottingham City Council confirmed the Queens Drive Park &amp; Ride Site will remain closed on Saturday, November 16 due to the standing water.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the Environment Agency told Nottinghamshire Live: "River levels on the Trent remain high and we ask people to remain vigilant and to check their flood risk.</p>
      <p>"The levels in Nottingham are steady at the Colwick Gauge and at around 1pm (Friday, November 15) were measured at 4.11m.</p>
      <p>"Our staff continue to monitor the levels as the water from the recent rain moves down the river.</p>
      <p>"We are working closely with partner agencies to protect people and property.</p>
      <p>"We will issue further alerts and warnings when necessary.</p>
      <p>"River levels are set to remain high and people should be vigilant across the East Midlands."</p>
