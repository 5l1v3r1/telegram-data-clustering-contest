      <p>Manchester United are among the sides leading the charge to sign Sporting Kansas City wonderkid Gianluca Busio.</p>
      <p>Central midfielder Busio, 17, is one of the MLS's most exciting talents having played 22 times in the league last season, scoring three times.</p>
      <p>He has played for the USA under 15 and 17 national teams, having been born in North Carolina, but is eligible to play for Italy through his Brescia-born father.</p>
      <p>Most recently Busio has been playing in the U17 World Cup - where the United States were dumped out in the group stage, having finished below Japan, Senegal and Netherlands in their group.</p>

      <p>But despite that disappointment, Busio's name is on the lips of a number of managers across some of Europe's biggest clubs.</p>
      <p>While speaking at WyScout’s two-day scouting conference in Holland, Sporting Kansas' director of scouting in Europe, Edward Burleson, revealed how United and Inter Milan are among those queuing for Busio's signature.</p>
      <p>“He’s a great talent. He is a player who can play safely in Europe,” Burleson told <a href="https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-a/esclusiva-tmw-kansas-city-burleson-busio-un-talento-e-uno-da-inter-1314415"><i>TuttoMercatoWeb.</i></a></p>

      <p>“He has great technique, he is a smart player, a box to box and he works hard. For me, if it wants to be successful at high levels, it must change soon.</p>
      <p>“If he wants to make a great career, he has to go to Europe soon. Then the technician will decide his future, and I honestly don’t think he will let him go because he is a great talent, a product of our youth sector and a player of which we are proud.</p>
      <p>“Inter? Yes, I also know about <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a>. These are things that came out. We also had an offer, even if not from Inter. But we didn’t let him go.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if and when it will happen, maybe in a year or between two. But what is certain is that the pressure on Busio is always greater, given the many clubs that are coming forward.”</p>
