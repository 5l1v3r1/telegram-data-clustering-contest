      <h1>Baker Mayfield, Mike Tomlin react to Myles Garrett helmet swing; Browns QB calls it 'inexcusable'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:49:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Bender</a></address>
      <p>Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield did not mince words when asked about teammate Myles Garrett’s actions in the final seconds of his team's 21-7 victory Thursday night over the Steelers. Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin, on the other hand, refused to comment.</p>
      <p>Garrett ripped Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph’s helmet off with eight seconds remaining in the game, then swung the helmet at Rudolph and hit Rudolph in the head. A fight ensued in the end zone, with Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey punching and kicking Garrett.</p>
      <p>The incident marred the Browns'victory over their biggest AFC North rival.Mayfield addressed it directly in a postgame interview.</p>

      <p>"The reality is, (Garrett is) going to get suspended,"Mayfield said. “We don’t know how long, and that hurts our team. We can’t do that. We can’t continue to hurt this team. It’s inexcusable."</p>

      <p>Garrett knows that, too.</p>
      <p>"I made a mistake, I lost my cool and I regret it," he said (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWF3cGKO9VQ">video via Cleveland.com</a>). "It's going to come back to hurt our team."</p>
      <p>The Browns improved to 4-6 with the victory but likely will be without Garrett for some time — perhaps for the rematch at Pittsburgh on Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>Tomlin did not elaborate when asked about Garrett’s actions.</p>
      <p>"I'll keep my thoughts to myself,"Tomlin said. "You saw what happened in the end."</p>
      <p>When asked if he had no comment, Tomlin replied, "That’s exactly what I said. I have no comment."</p>
      <p>The only question now is what punishment Garrett will face from the NFL. ESPN’s Louis Riddick, a former player, recommended a season-ending suspension.</p>
