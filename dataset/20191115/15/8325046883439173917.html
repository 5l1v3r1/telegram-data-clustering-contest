        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/electronic-arts">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> on Friday launched their newest game, “<a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=biip_11519_star-wars-jedi-fallen-order&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fstar-wars-jedi-fallen-order-deluxe-edition-xbox-one%2F6340410.p%3FskuId%3D6340410">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>.”</li>
        <li>It’s a third-person action-adventure game that introduces you to new characters and a new adventure set in the “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/star-wars">Star Wars</a>” universe.</li>
        <li>The game captures the essence of “Star Wars”: It rewards exploration, looks and sounds polished, and offers great thrills and story. You’ll be playing this one late into the night.</li>

      <p>I’ve played about five hours of the newest “Star Wars” game, and I can already tell you: This is the best “Star Wars” game ever made, and it’s already one of my favorite games of the year.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment, which provided me with an early review copy of the game, I’ve been able to dig into the first few chapters of “<a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=biip_11519_star-wars-jedi-fallen-order&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fstar-wars-jedi-fallen-order-deluxe-edition-xbox-one%2F6340410.p%3FskuId%3D6340410">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>” before its launch on Friday.</p>
      <p>It has everything “Star Wars” fans love and want: Epic, incredible set pieces, memorable and funny alien characters, and tons of lore about the “Star Wars” universe. But it also excels as a video game, with polished visuals and exciting gameplay that really makes you feel like a Jedi swinging around a lightsaber.</p>
      <p>Oh, and the music. It wouldn’t be “Star Wars” without some gorgeous tunes in the background, and “Jedi: Fallen Order” delivers. I routinely feel like I was dropped into a “Star Wars” movie that just so happens to be a video game.</p>
      <h3>What it feels like to play, spoiler-free</h3>
      <p>In this game, you’re a guy named Cal, who’s been hiding out on an alien planet for years because he wants no one to know he’s a Jedi. But once the secret gets out, Cal embarks on a journey to help rebuild the broken-up Jedi Order.</p>
      <p>I’m not going to give away any plot spoilers, but just know that this has all of the makings of “Star Wars”: You’ll get your own ship, alien friends and crew members, and the ability to jump to different planets to upgrade your character through exploration and combat.</p>

      <p>Speaking of exploration and combat, much of the gameplay here is heavily inspired by some of the greatest video games of the past decade. While “<a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=biip_11519_star-wars-jedi-fallen-order&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fstar-wars-jedi-fallen-order-deluxe-edition-xbox-one%2F6340410.p%3FskuId%3D6340410">Jedi: Fallen Order</a>” doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it seamlessly blends all of these mechanics together in a game that feels fluid and easy to pick up. It has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The exploration of “Tomb Raider”</li>
        <li>The traversal and climbing mechanics of “Uncharted”</li>
        <li>The map system of “Metroid Prime”</li>
        <li>The wall-running mechanics of “Prince of Persia”</li>
        <li>The save and respawn system of “Dark Souls”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It also has great writing and plenty of wit, too. I don’t feel like I’m playing some generic “Star Wars” title. You can tell a lot of effort was put into this game to make it stand out, and in this way, EA and Respawn were successful.</p>
      <h3>My recommendation: Go buy it</h3>
      <p>If you like “Star Wars,” at all, you should definitely buy this game. I’ve only just scratched the surface of the game, but it already has everything I love about the franchise and then some.</p>
      <p>If you don’t like “Star Wars,” or are unfamiliar with that particular universe, you’ll still probably enjoy this game. It has a fun rhythm to it. It doesn’t feel like too much exploration, or too much combat, but an excellent balance of both. It does a great job showcasing what’s possible in a 2019 video game in terms of style, visuals, and gameplay, but it also feels highly addictive through systems that continually upgrade your character and his abilities.</p>
