      <p>
        <b>Thanks to the diverse, complex nature of modern controllers and sequencers, there are plenty of ways to get expressive and creative with electronic sounds, whether you’re a virtuosic keyboard player or somebody who lacks the dexterity to cope with anything beyond a simple triad.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In this issue’s cover feature, we’re looking at taking control of software, hardware and – most interestingly – both at once, in order to unleash your full creativity. There’s plenty of inspiration to be had in this issue’s artist features too – from Buchla-driven jams with Floating Points or Alan Braxe, to the tribal grooves of Fuck Buttons and pop sensibilities of Jaded. We hope you enjoy the mag!</p>
