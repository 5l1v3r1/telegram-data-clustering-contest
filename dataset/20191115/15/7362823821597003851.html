      <p>Dear Santa, is this really you?</p>
      <p>On behalf of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/occasions/christmas">Kris Kringle</a>, Germany’s Deutsche Post has enlisted 20 workers to respond to the thousands of letters from children all over the world that are expected to fly in before <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/occasions/christmas">Christmas.</a></p>
      <p>Last year, a “representative” for Santa Claus and the postal employees in the northern German town of Himmelpfort answered 277,200 letters from 64 countries during the yuletide season, the Associated Press reports.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, St. Nick’s helpers again opened a special post office in the small village where they answer letters in various languages – including Braille – and even respond to all inquiries with a unique Santa postmark.</p>
      <p>The annual tradition first began in 1984, when postal workers in Himmelpfort (which means “heaven’s gate,”) received two letters addressed to Father Christmas himself.</p>
      <p>Not wanting to send the notes back with “recipient unknown,” they answered.</p>
