      <p>The president of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) feels the threat of steeper fines may help deter would-be trespassers.</p>
      <p>SARM president Ray Orb, along with representatives from the RCMP and Ministry of Corrections and Policing, took part in a panel on rural crime prevention during the organization’s midterm convention in Regina on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Although the province <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/new-trespassing-law-will-mean-you-have-to-seek-permission-before-accessing-land">recently passed legislation to strengthen the Trespass to Property Act</a>, the law has not yet been enacted, but does in fact include steeper fines. When the legislation comes into force, fines may be up to $5,000, an increase from $2,000.</p>
      <p>Orb said he is still hearing a lot about trespassers entering yard sites, and residents are concerned for their safety. Orb is pleased with the province’s new law, which places the onus on individuals to get permission to access properties. But he believes a hike in the fines for trespassing may also be necessary.</p>
      <p>“We see that as something we may have to look at in Saskatchewan,” Orb said during the panel.</p>
      <p>Orb referenced <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/alberta-hikes-trespassing-fine-to-ward-off-anti-farming-animal-activists">the Alberta government’s move</a> to increase trespassing fines in response to an incident when protesters entered a Hutterite colony near Lethbridge in September. The fine for trespassing on agricultural land was increased up to $10,000 for a first offence, double that of the fine under Saskatchewan’s revised law.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Ministry of Justice said the province is aware of the Alberta government’s proposed changes, and will monitor how its proposals unfold.</p>
      <p>Orb said SARM will wait and see how much of a deterrent the new trespassing law is once put into practice.</p>
      <p>“We’re hoping that it makes a difference. We hope it helps,” said Orb.</p>
      <h3>RCMP’s number of vacant positions the lowest in years </h3>
      <p>One of the concerns often expressed by rural residents has been RCMP staffing levels.</p>
      <p>During the panel, the RCMP revealed its number of vacant positions has reached a record low. Many hard vacancies, which are positions that had been sitting empty for a long period of time, have now been filled.</p>
      <p>“We’re almost fully stacked up as far as the province goes,” said Chief Supt. Alfredo Bangloy, criminal operations officer for the RCMP’s F Division in the province.</p>
      <p>Bangloy said it’s the lowest vacancy rate the RCMP has seen in “many years.” The RCMP could not provide the exact number of current vacancies.</p>
      <p>The RCMP’s training facility, Depot, received approximately 90 cadets in the first half of this year.</p>
      <p>During the 2018-19 training year, the RCMP nationally enrolled 1,280 cadets, an increase from 2012-13, when it enrolled 395.</p>

      <h3>Crime watch network reaches 12,000 users</h3>
      <p>When Orb asked the room who was signed up to the Saskatchewan Crime Watch Advisory Network, nearly everyone raised their hands.</p>
      <p>According to the RCMP, the online service has 12,000 registered users. Launched in March, the advisory network allows RCMP detachments to send out alerts to residents concerning criminal activity. So far, the RCMP is pleased with how the system is working.</p>
      <p>“It has shown a lot of results and success as far as assisting us in resolving various issues, from suspicious persons to specific crimes,” said Bangloy.</p>
      <h3>Province’s pilot project using tracking devices on farm equipment</h3>
      <p>The RCMP is taking part in a pilot project that uses tracking devices to help police find stolen farm equipment.</p>
      <p>The tracking devices are patched into the RCMP’s communications centre in Regina, allowing police to find out where the equipment is located.</p>
      <p>Created by Rivercity Technology Services, the BeeSecure system sends a text message and GPS data to the owner’s cell phone when an object with a tracking device moves. The equipment does not require permanent power or the Internet to be used.</p>
      <p>The technology is currently being tested in the Rural Municipality of Mayfield. Bangloy said he was not aware of any devices using the technology having been stolen.</p>
