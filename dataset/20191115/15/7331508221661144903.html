      <h1>Mason Rudolph's agent won't rule out legal options; police not investigating Myles Garrett</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:02:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">Brooke Pryor</a></address>
      <p>CLEVELAND -- The agent for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> isn't ruling out any legal options in the aftermath of Thursday's melee.</p>
      <p>"I am gathering all information and no options have been removed from the table," Tim Younger said when reached by text message Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Cleveland police Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said Friday that they are not investigating <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns">Browns</a> defensive end <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122132/myles-garrett">Myles Garrett</a>, adding that they had not received a complaint from Rudolph.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was struck in the head with his own helmet by Garrett after the defensive end ripped it off in the final seconds of the Steelers' <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128044">21-7 loss</a>.</p>
      <p>A city spokeswoman said the prosecutor can't comment because Rudolph hasn't filed a complaint.</p>
      <p>The fight started when Garrett took Rudolph to the ground following the quarterback's short pass to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2970090/trey-edmunds">Trey Edmunds</a> on third-and-long. Rudolph appeared to attempt to dislodge Garrett's helmet as the two exchanged words. As Rudolph stood up, Garrett ripped Rudolph's helmet off and swung it at him as offensive lineman <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14935/david-decastro">David DeCastro</a> tried to push Garrett away.</p>
      <p>"It was pretty cowardly," Rudolph said. "Pretty bush league."</p>
      <p>The incident evoked memories of Tennessee's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/3543/albert-haynesworth">Albert Haynesworth</a> stomping on the head of the Cowboys' <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3565/andre-gurode">Andre Gurode</a> during a 2006 game. Haynesworth was suspended five games, but Gurode opted against pressing criminal charges or filing a civil lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Younger <a href="https://twitter.com/YoungerAssoc/status/1195227850883751937">tweeted</a> about Thursday night's incident after the game.</p>
      <p>"There are many risks an NFL QB assumes with every snap taken on the field," Younger wrote. "Being hit on your uncovered head by a helmet being swung by a 275-lb DE is not one of them. Tonight could have had a catastrophic ending. The matter will be reviewed thoroughly."</p>
