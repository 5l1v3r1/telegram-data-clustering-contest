      <p>In an email sent to employees on Friday and obtained by Business Insider, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-plank-is-stepping-down-as-ceo-of-under-armour-2019-10">Under Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank</a> responded to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-under-armours-sales-scramble-pulling-forward-every-quarter-11573777489">an explosive Wall Street Journal report published Thursday</a> detailing allegations that the athletics giant “pushed early shipments” and “dumped goods at off-price chains” such as TJ Maxx to keep up its run of strong sales growth.</p>
      <p>“Given recent events that have entered the realm of public opinion without full context, it is disappointing to have our integrity and reputation called into question,” Plank wrote. “Amid a paradox of being constrained by an ongoing, two and a half year investigation and wanting to address media allegations raised by anonymous sources – our integrity is unshaken. We’ve certainly never claimed to be perfect, but our team has earned and deserves more respect than this reporting currently affords us.”</p>
      <p>Under Armour’s accounting practices are the focus of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armour-is-subject-of-federal-accounting-probe-11572819835?mod=breakingnews">The Journal reported earlier this month</a> that federal authorities were looking into whether the sportswear brand “shifted sales from quarter to quarter to appear healthier.”</p>
      <p>Former sales and merchandising executives who were quoted as anonymous sources in The Journal’s Thursday article said the company would ask retailers to take products ahead of schedule and sold items meant for its factory stores to off-price stores to maintain strong sales numbers.</p>
      <p>“It was a pretty common practice to pull forward orders from the month after the quarter to ship within the quarter in order to hit the number or close the gap,” a former sales executive told The Journal, adding that the “problem is once this starts it doesn’t seem to stop.”</p>
      <p>A representative for the company declined to comment further on Plank’s email but told Business Insider earlier on Friday: “We are aware of recent media coverage concerning Under Armour’s business practices. As we have stated previously, we firmly believe that our disclosures and our accounting practices have been entirely appropriate. Our management and board of directors have reviewed this matter extensively over the past two and a half years and stand by the Company’s financial reporting. Because the investigation is ongoing, we are constrained in our response and cannot address every allegation raised in the media or by anonymous sources cited in the news.”</p>
      <h3>Read Plank’s full note:</h3>
      <p>Dear Teammates,</p>
      <p>Next week, we’ll enter our 15th year as a publicly traded company – a period marked with incredible effort, heart and passion from thousands of teammates that have worked tirelessly to create one of the world’s largest athletic performance brands. Since the beginning, we’ve operated with two core tenets: integrity and improvement. Both are vital for sustainable growth, positive reputation and longevity. Under Armour would not exist without these qualities</p>
      <p>As a brand centered on making athletes better, sportsmanship is inherent in everything we do. Win or lose, we play with honor, fairness and respect for the game. Our team works and drives hard toward any goal we set out to accomplish. We are playing the long game, building an eternal brand.</p>
      <p>Given recent events that have entered the realm of public opinion without full context, it is disappointing to have our integrity and reputation called into question. Amid a paradox of being constrained by an ongoing, two and a half year investigation and wanting to address media allegations raised by anonymous sources – our integrity is unshaken. We’ve certainly never claimed to be perfect, but our team has earned and deserves more respect than this reporting currently affords us.</p>
      <p>With respect to inquiries into Under Armour’s business practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, we firmly believe that our disclosures and our accounting practices have been entirely appropriate. We respect the government’s process and will continue to cooperate with thoughtful and proper resolve.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, I want to thank this team for all that you do – each and every day. Let’s all lock arms on our continuing march to building the best sports performance brand on the planet.</p>
      <p>Kevin Plank</p>
      <p>Under Armour, Inc.</p>
      <p>Chairman &amp; CEO</p>
      <h3>Read Under Armour’s full statement:</h3>
      <p>We are aware of recent media coverage concerning Under Armour’s business practices. As we have stated previously, we firmly believe that our disclosures and our accounting practices have been entirely appropriate. Our management and board of directors have reviewed this matter extensively over the past two and a half years and stand by the Company’s financial reporting. Because the investigation is ongoing, we are constrained in our response and cannot address every allegation raised in the media or by anonymous sources cited in the news.</p>
      <p>When Under Armour speaks, we always communicate our best understanding as to the market and the Company’s prospects. For many years, quarterly shifts in wholesale revenue related to timing of shipments based on financial goals; customer requests; year-to-year seasonal variance; different fiscal calendar alignments; product availability; logistics; and numerous other dynamics have been, and continue to be, part of the normal course of business practices in the apparel, footwear and retail sector. In this respect, our process for recognizing revenue and recording returns and other allowances has not changed and has always been in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles. Indeed, as reported by certain media outlets, analysts and accounting experts agree that such end-of-quarter practices are generally permitted under accounting rules.</p>
      <p>Under Armour has become one of the world’s largest athletic performance brands through industry-defining innovation, ambitious and driven leadership, and a culture that holds itself to the highest standards of integrity including operating within standard industry business practices and always in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
