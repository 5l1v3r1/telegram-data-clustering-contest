      <h1>China completes lander test for first Mars mission in 2020</h1>

      <p>China on Thursday successfully completed a lander test in northern Hebei province ahead of an unmanned exploration mission to Mars next year.</p>
      <p>China is on track to launch its Mars mission in 2020, Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration, said on Thursday. Zhang was speaking ahead of the hovering-and-obstacle avoidance test for the lander.</p>
      <p>The journey through space will take about seven months, while landing will take seven minutes, said Zhang Rongqiao, chief architect of the Mars exploration program.</p>
      <p>The test was conducted at a sprawling landing test site in Huailai, northwest of Beijing.</p>
      <p>China has developed the powerful Long March 5 rocket to transport the probe to Mars in 2020.</p>
      <p>The same rocket is meant to deliver the Chang'e-5 probe to the moon by the end of 2019 or early next year to bring back samples of lunar rocks.</p>

      <p>The Chang'e-4 probe successfully touched down on the far side of the moon in January this year, a historic first and major achievement for China's space program.</p>
      <p>China made its first lunar landing in 2013.</p>
      <p>China expects to complete a modular space station around 2022, around the time when NASA is said to start building a new space station laboratory to orbit the moon, as a pit stop for missions to other parts of the solar system.</p>
      <p>In 2003, China became the third nation to put a man in space with its own rocket after the former Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
      <p>Since then, it has been racing to catch up with Russia and the United States and become a major space power by 2030.Â </p>
