      <h1>Jawa Perak Bobber Launched In India At Rs. 1.94 Lakh</h1>

      <h3>The long-awaited Jawa Perak has been launched today in India with a BS6 334 cc single-cylinder liquid-cooled DOHC engine making 30 horsepower</h3>
      <p>The Jawa brand was brought back into the domestic market just a year ago and since then, as expected, it has been well-received among customers. The re-entry was announced with three motorcycles as the Jawa, Forty Two and Perak graced the grand stage. However, only the retro classic motorcycles reached showrooms until now.</p>
      <p>The Perak was lauded for its uniqueness and the non-conservative tag it carried when it was showcased and Jawa intended to price the bobber at Rs. 1.89 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). Twelve months after the Czech company announced its revival, the Perak has been launched in the volume capable Indian market today for a price of Rs. 1,94,500 (ex-showroom, Delhi) and is the first BS6 motorcycle from the brand.</p>
      <p>The brand will be hoping to repeat the sales success of the Jawa and Forty Two with the Perak we would presume as it has a niche of its own particularly with its body style.</p>

      <p>The Perak has a striking exterior and gives a big bike feel. On the styling department, it boasts a low slung stance, chopped fenders allowing for an exposed rear end, bar-end mirrors, round-shaped headlamp unit and a handlebar having relaxed riding position. The production-ready model does not differ from the one showcased last November either thankfully.</p>
      <p>The stying is topped off by matte paint jobs and aggressive crossport exhaust system. The Jawa Perak is powered by a 334 cc single-cylinder liquid-cooled DOHC unit with bigger bore and similar stroke compared to the engine used in the Jawa and Forty Two. Additionally, it is more powerful as well and is mated to a six-speed gearbox.</p>

      <p>The powertrain is good enough to produce a maximum power output of 30 hp and 31 Nm of peak torque â€“ 3 hp and 3 Nm more than its sibling duo. As in the mechanical side, it has a different subframe as well. The Perak has an advantage of not having a direct rival in India and it will be interesting to see how its sales pan out in the coming months.</p>
      <p>It will reach dealerships by the middle of December 2019 and comes equipped with telescopic front forks and monoshock rear suspension. Dual-channel ABS developed by Continental is standard. Test rides for the Jawa Perak will begin tomorrow with bookings planned from the 1st of January 2020. Deliveries will happen in a phased manner in the next three months.</p>
