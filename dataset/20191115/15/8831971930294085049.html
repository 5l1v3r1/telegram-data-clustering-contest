      <h1>Why Gen X Is Now Called The “Karen Generation”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:25:32+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/greist/" target="_blank">Greis Torres</a></address>
      <p>The generational fight of millennials and Gen Z vs. baby boomers gain more prominence in social media with the phrase “OK boomer,” but now there’s another generational fight brewing in the depths of Twitter. This time it includes another generation that was rarely mentioned in this type of online war.</p>
      <p>Gen Z is now calling Gen X the “Karen generation” because they are usually racist, homophobic, anti-vaxxers, and climate change deniers.</p>
      <p>The term Karen is a representation of the stereotypical middle-aged, white mom who is always asking for a manager, is homophobic and transphobic, <i><u><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/gen-z-is-calling-gen-x-the-karen-generation">BuzzFeed</a></u> </i>reports.</p>
      <p>The stereotype sprung from the misunderstanding between the two generations. Gen Z has been fighting for causes that are not important for Gen X such as climate change and gay rights.</p>
      <p>“Especially in Norway, where the strike for climate change is going strong, you see parents mocking Greta Thunberg and the other young adults participating because they themselves are not willing to change how they live their lives,” Julia, a 23-year-old from Norway told <i>BuzzFeed</i>.</p>
      <p>The battleground for this war is Twitter, where many Gen Z’ers have tweeted about Gen X’ers’ new nickname.</p>

      <p>Don’t get this new generational war wrong, baby boomers are still getting a lot of heat from Gen Z’ers. The thing is that Gen X’ers are the parents of Gen Z’ers, who are mostly in their teens and are rebellious.</p>
      <p>But the name Karen seems to be very fitting for the Gen X’ers since the name spiked in popularity in early 1960s, according to the <u><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/popularnames.cgi">Social Security Administration</a></u>.</p>
      <p>It is not sure if Gen Z is seriously going after baby boomers and Gen X. There are people who have taken the generational wars as a good joke, but there are others who haven’t.</p>

      <p>Many people have expressed through social media that Gen X are the ones who yell at customer service employees and really don’t care about the planet or anyone. Technically, Gen X’ers are cynical about everything Gen Z’ers care about.</p>
      <p>“They’re generally our parents, the ones who invalidate the LGBT community or (basically any) issues in the world today,” Hailee Wong, 17, from San Diego told <i>BuzzFeed</i>.</p>
      <p>The prevalent sentiment is that baby boomers are not the only ones responsible for starting trouble and invalidating what Gen Z’ers stand for, Gen X’ers also need to share the blame because they start trouble too.</p>
      <p>Although generational feuding has always happened in human history, this particular one, to the dismay of Gen Z, is gender-biased. The stereotype is sexist and once again places women as the overly-dramatic ones.</p>
      <p>“It’s so normal to use female names if you want to create a nagging narrative, as men are never seen as such,” Julia told <i>BuzzFeed.</i></p>
