      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Jury deliberations have resumed in the trial of Roger Stone, a veteran Republican political operative and longtime confidant of President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Jurors debated the seven charges against Stone for about six hours Thursday without reaching a verdict.</p>
      <p>Stone was indicted in January as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election tampering.</p>
      <p>He is accused of lying to Congress about his attempts to communicate with the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, tampering with witnesses and obstructing a House Intelligence Committee investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Several witnesses have highlighted how Stone was regarded as an “access point” to WikiLeaks due to his frequent boasts of having insider access to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</p>
