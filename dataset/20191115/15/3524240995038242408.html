      <p>Maiharaji Altine, Gusau</p>
      <p>Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State said his decision to reverse the appointments of 21 permanent secretaries was because they didn’t pass an aptitude test conducted by the State Government to assess their competence.</p>
      <p>Briefing journalists at Government House, Gusau on Thursday, Matawalle said his government had decided to reduce the number of permanent secretaries because the state has the highest number of permanent secretaries in the North-West zone which made the government set up a committee to test their competency.</p>
      <p>“All assessments have shown that our state has a far greater number of permanent secretaries than any of our sister states in the North-West, as such, we constituted a restructuring committee to verify their competence.”</p>
      <p>“The Restructuring Committee, therefore, invited all the existing permanent secretaries and six others whose appointments were reversed by the past administration and subjected them to a written test and interview in order to assess their competences.</p>
      <p>“Based on the outcome of the assessment, only 26 qualified for retention as permanent secretaries,” said the governor.</p>
      <p>Matawalle appreciated the strategy adopted by the committee in conducting this important exercise and consequently accepted to drop 21 of those who have failed the test and retain the 26 who passed.</p>
      <p>He, however, maintained that those who did not qualify for retention and were found eligible would be considered for appointments as Directors General, Managing Directors, Executive Secretaries, Secretaries and other appropriate positions in the state civil service.</p>
