      <h2>Beckie Wilde explains why she joined Slimming World, how it helped her shed an incredible eight-and-a-half stone and why she is launching her own slimming group</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:12:14+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author">Jonny Dillon</a></address>
      <p>About a year before Beckie Wilde joined Slimming World she went to the doctors as her feet had been feeling tingly for the past few months and were beginning to get worse. Although Beckie was only 22 at the time, the cause of her health issues was determined to be her weight, which was 25 stone at the time.</p>
      <p>Explaining her weight gain Beckie said: “I was at uni at the time and didn’t realise how the student lifestyle was affecting me and my weight. I used to think cooking something was putting a meal in the microwave and heating it up!</p>
      <p>“I had hit rock bottom - I was so unhappy. I hated my body and I hated myself for letting things get like that. I knew that if I didn’t do something about my weight that I would become seriously ill.”</p>

      <p>Beckie began to try various different ‘fad diets’ and even tried dieting pills, but nothing seemed to work. After joining a gym, she was beginning to see some results and lost around a stone and a half. </p>
      <p>However, going into her final year of university meant she no longer had the time to go the gym four times a week and swim twice a week.</p>
      <p>After being told by her doctor that she must lose weight or potentially undergo weight loss surgery, Beckie decided to make a serious change. She said: “I looked into lots of different groups and decided that I would go to a local Slimming World group. I remember being sat in my car before the group started and I just sat there and cried. </p>
      <p>“I was so scared and nervous, this was my last chance to change my life. I walked in and sat down with the other new members and listened to the new member talk. </p>
      <p>“I honestly didn’t think Slimming World would work for me - how can you eat so much, and as often as you like, and still lose weight? I could even still go out on nights out with my friends and be on plan!”</p>

      <p>Beckie set herself the target of losing a massive 11-and-a-half stone to slim down to her dream weight, and with the encouragement and support from the Slimming World group and consultant, she is well on her way to achieving that target.</p>
      <p>Beckie said: “Now I’ve gone on to lose eight and a half stone in two-and-a-half years, I will never ever let my weight ruin my life again.</p>
      <p>“I can eat what I like, I enjoy food now and enjoy cooking it. I still enjoy the naughty things like take away, nights out, chocolate and sweets but now it’s all on plan. The best thing is I feel like myself again, I’m more confident, happy and healthy. I can honestly say that Slimming World saved my life.”</p>
      <p><b>Beckie is launching her own Slimming World group on Mondays at The Lantern in Ilfracombe at 9.30am which is open to all of those that what to join.</b> <b>To find your local Swimming World group, go to <a href="https://www.slimmingworld.co.uk/">www.slimmingworld.co.uk</a></b></p>
