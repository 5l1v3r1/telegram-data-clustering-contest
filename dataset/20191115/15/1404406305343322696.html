      <h1>Kodak Black's Team Believe He Was Drugged and Set Up in Prison Brawl</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:55:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">VladTV</a></address>
      <p>According to TMZ, Kodak Black's team believes the rapper was set up and drugged when he got in <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/258695/kodak-black-allegedly-involved-in-prison-fight-that-left-one-guard">a prison fight</a> that sent a guard to the hospital. </p>
      <p>Surveillance video shows Kodak drinking a cup of coffee about 20 minutes before the fight, which his team believes was spiked with a substance that altered his state of mind. Witnesses say Kodak looked under the influence during the fight, adding that he displayed incredible strength while officers were trying to restrain him during the incident. </p>
      <p>Kodak's team believes the circumstances surrounding the incident are suspicious, including that the inmate that he was in the altercation with was put in Kodak's pod that day and then released on bond 12 hours later. They also pointed out that Kodak has never caused any problems when he was locked up before.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors were suggesting that time be added on to Kodak's recent sentencing in his federal firearms case, which the judge denied when <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/258949/kodak-black-sentenced-to-3-years-and-8-months-for-federal-weapons-charges">he was sentenced </a>to a little under four years this week. </p>
