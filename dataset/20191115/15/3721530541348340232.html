      <p><i>Dwarf Fortress</i> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/13/18263905/dwarf-fortress-steam-graphics-workshop">will be getting graphics soon</a>, much to the delight of its devoted fans. But, after nearly 17 years in development, there’s a few final items that need to get finished first. On Thursday, Tarn “Toady One” Adams returned from the depths with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/975370/announcements/detail/1608276884523197532">news of what that update will contain</a>, and details on the new enemies it will bring with it.</p>
      <p>Villains will have access to a new kind of subterfuge in the form of infiltrators, who will blend into the population of your fortress and attempt to undermine your control. Previous versions of <i>Dwarf Fortress </i>(full title <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/slaves-to-armok-god-of-blood-chapter-2-dwarf-fortress/6954"><i>Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter 2: Dwarf Fortress</i></a>) featured vampires that similarly blend in with your community. But, while vampires only had a limited number of identities they can assume, infiltrators are much more deceptive. Infiltrators will get their disguises by scanning the areas near your fortress and choosing an identity that make sense in context. That should make infiltrators far more difficult to suss out once they’re actually in your fortress.</p>

      <p>When an infiltrator does arrive inside your walls, they’ll start sowing seeds of dissent. Infiltrators can corrupt your dwarves with flattery, intimidation, promises of revenge, or any other form of deceitful and villainous slander. The final step before they’re released into the wild will be to implement a justice system for dealing with them once they’re uncovered.</p>
      <p>Adams also provided an update on the development of the next update’s religions features. As part of the update, communities within your fort will form religious organizations and, if they have enough members, can petition you to build them a temple or appoint a high priest.</p>
      <p>There’s still no word on when exactly the update will be released. Once it’s out, Adams says that releasing the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/13/18263905/dwarf-fortress-steam-graphics-workshop">Steam version of the game</a> will become the new priority.</p>
