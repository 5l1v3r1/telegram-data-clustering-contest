      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/make/chevrolet">Corvette</a> has left the building … for now.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/last-front-engine-chevrolet-corvette-sold-for-2-7-million-at-charity-auction">2019 Z06</a> rolled off the line a few weeks later than planned due to the 40-day UAW strike. The black-over-red coupe already has a buyer who paid a whopping $2.7 million for it at a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/last-front-engine-chevrolet-corvette-sold-for-2-7-million-at-charity-auction">charity auction in June supporting the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation</a>.</p>
