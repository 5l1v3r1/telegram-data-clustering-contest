        <figcaption>The GIANT Toblerone on sale at Home Bargains</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Home Bargains has mammoth 4.5kg Toblerones on sale.</p>
      <p>The jumbo sized chocolate treat is the equivalent of 45 standard-sized 100g Toblerone bars, which cost between £1 and £1.50 each at most supermarkets. Or a dozen-plus 360g large bars, which usually cost £4.25.</p>
      <p>Home Bargains has the huge Toblerone on sale for £49, down from an RRP of £73.99. The bar is a giant version of a Toblerone, complete with huge triangular chunks of chocolate, which you might need help to cut through.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/shoppers-outraged-ridiculous-price-home-17254067">Liverpool Echo reports</a> , the price of the 80cm long bar has startled some shoppers, who would never part with almost £50 for a chocolate bar. If you bought 45 standard Toblerones from ASDA today, it would cost you £45 for the same weight of Toblerone, based on a 100g bar <a href="https://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/asda-compare-prices/Block_Chocolate/Toblerone_Milk_Chocolate_Bar_100g.html">being on sale for £1.</a></p>
      <p>Posting on Facebook, Home Bargains wrote: We’re gonna need a bigger bag!”</p>
      <p>"GIANT Toblerone bars are available in stores now."</p>
      <p>But customers are not all convinced, even though Home Bargains is selling the huge Toblerone for less than its recommended retail price.</p>
      <p>"I love these, but seriously £49 for chocolate," wrote one.</p>
      <p>"Who would pay £50 for this? A Christmas dinner to feed the whole family wouldn't cost this much," replied another. The bars are also being sold by Cadburys online at £75.</p>
