      <p>South Park has come under fire for a ‘transphobic’ gag in their latest episode with viewers accusing the cartoon of mocking trans athletes.</p>
      <p>The divisive animation is now well into its 23rd series and has got their by taking no prisoners, which has ultimately been both South Park’s triumph and, for some, its downfall.</p>
      <p>The latest instalment falls into the latter. One of the storylines featured a character named Strong Woman, who ahead of a her round in a Strongwoman contest, reveals she’s ‘honoured’ to be going up against the first trans women to enter the competition.</p>

      <p>The athlete is basically a South Parked doppleganger to the late wrestler Randy Savage called Heather Swanson, who explains that she transitioned into a woman two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t tell you how free I feel. Now that I can compete as female, I’m ready to smash the other girls,’ she ferociously declares in an interview.</p>

      <p>‘I’m not here to talk about my transition, I’m here to kick some f***ing ass.’</p>
      <p>And Heather’s a natural in every single round, living up to her promise of smashing the other girls in shot put throwing, weight lifting and tyre flipping.</p>
      <p>However, the twist comes when it turns out Heather was actually Strong Woman’s ex-boyfriend who entered the contest for revenge.</p>
      <p>The instalment has now been slammed on social media, with Canadian cycling champions and trans activist Rachel McKinnon blasting the jokes as ‘lazy’ and highlighting Futurama made the same joke almost 20 years ago.</p>

      <p>‘I’m not particularly mad about the South Park episode,’ Rachel began on Twitter. ‘Yes it’s transphobic. Yes it’s lazy. Yes, it contributes to harm to trans women and girls. But they’re lazy and increasingly irrelevant. F***, Futurama made the same stupid storyline in 2003. Transphobes don’t have new jokes.”</p>
      <p>She went on: ‘South Park has been deeply transphobic the *entire time*. This isn’t their first explicitly transphobic story line. It won’t be their last. Stone and Parker are transphobes. Write them off. Ignore their lazy show.’</p>
      <p>But fans of South Park have leapt to the gag’s defence, stressing creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker were exposing toxic masculinity and transphobia in sport.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Several female athletes have tried to call out trans athletes, complaining they have an advantage. In a recent survey, 11 out of 15 female British Olympians anonymously agreed: ‘It can never be fair for transgender athletes who have been through male puberty to compete in female sport.’</p>
      <p>Either way, Stone and Parker’s intention appears to be blurred and the internet is divided:</p>
