      <p>A Church of Scotland minister who branded Jeremy Corbyn a “terrorist sympathiser” has been suspended after controversial tweets emerged.</p>
      <p>While campaigning in Glasgow on Wednesday, the Labour leader was interrupted as he explained the scarf he was wearing had been given to him by the Who Cares Scotland charity.</p>
      <p>Richard Cameron, a minister at Scotstoun Parish Church, shouted at Mr Corbyn: “I thought you’d be wearing your Islamic jihad scarf.</p>

      <p>“Who’s going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you’re prime minister?”</p>
      <p>After footage of the encounter attracted attention, Labour pointed to a series of controversial tweets it said were posted by Mr Cameron, including remarks saying “homosexual behaviour is a sin” and “allowing children to change their gender is wicked”.</p>
      <p>The Church of Scotland said Mr Cameron will not be allowed to work as a minister while an inquiry takes place.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “In accordance with our procedures, Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended.</p>
      <p>“This is to allow us to carry out an inquiry in relation to the incident which took place earlier this week and the subsequent complaints about his social media use.”</p>
      <p>A post on Mr Cameron’s Twitter account in September read: “Christ has the power to help and change anyone. Obviously many gays hate this because want to carry on in their perversion.”</p>

      <p>The account also shared a series of controversial views on Islam, describing terrorism as “a problem Islam needs to deal with”, a full face veil as “oppressive and unBritish” and the prophet Muhammad as “a violent man”.</p>
      <p>PA has checked the account and verified that it belongs to Mr Cameron.</p>
      <p>During his encounter with the Labour leader, Mr Cameron also said: “Do you think that the man who is going to be prime minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?'”</p>
      <p>The Labour leader did not react and was ushered into the nearby community centre he was due to visit.</p>
      <p>Mr Cameron then accused Mr Corbyn of “running away”.</p>
      <p>At the time, the Church of Scotland rebuked Mr Cameron for the way he approached the situation, saying: “Whilst we may occasionally robustly challenge policy issues with which we disagree, we always intend to do that in a way that is polite and measured and allows for reasoned debate.”</p>
