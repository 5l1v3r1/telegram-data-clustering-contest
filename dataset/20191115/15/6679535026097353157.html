      <p>The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), functioning under the aegis of Ministry of Women and Child Development organised a meeting here on Friday with the stakeholders on protecting the children, especially students, from substance abuse.</p>
      <p>Chairing the meeting, member, NCPCR, R.G. Anand said the child protection awareness programmes, being organised across the country, had benefited students, members of self-help groups, judicial staff, workers of children’s homes, police and railway personnel. The awareness pamphlets on protecting the children and their rights were being circulated with the objective of protecting the children from trafficking, rights violation issues and substance abuse.</p>
      <p>Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish said 3,121 children, including 1,601 boys and 1,520 girls were being taken care in 82 registered homes for the children in the district. The non-governmental organisations running the children’s homes and the workers had been sensitized on the regulations to be strictly followed through periodic programmes being organised by the Department of Social Defence.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, Mr. Anand said the consultative meeting was being organised in the districts with the objective of protecting the children from substance abuse, which was prevalent in some parts of Tamil Nadu. Since drug abuse among children in the northern districts and use of ganja among students in southern districts had been reported, the NCPCR, in a bid to save them from such evils, was conducting the meetings with the stakeholders to discuss the issues prevailing in substance abuse among children.</p>
      <p>“Of the 9,000-odd complaints received by the NCPCR, over 7,000 petitions have been disposed following proper inquiry,” he informed. He also released substance abuse awareness posters. Superintendent of Police Om Prakash Meena, Assistant Commissioners of Police, Deputy Superintendents of Police, Chief Educational Officer Bhoopathi and others participated.</p>
