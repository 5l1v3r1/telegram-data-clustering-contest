      <p>These are expected to run as normal.</p>
      <p>Parbold – Todmorden – These services will start from and terminate at Manchester Victoria. Bus replacement will operate between Manchester Victoria and Todmorden serving all intermediate stations.</p>
      <p>Alternative train service is available from Manchester Victoria calling at Rochdale, Littleborough, Walsden and Todmorden.</p>
