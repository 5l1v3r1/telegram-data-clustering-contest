      <h1>Plastic Made From Fish Waste Wins James Dyson Award 2019</h1>

      <p>This year's winner of the James Dyson award made a nifty single-use bioplastic out of organic fish waste.</p>
      <p>Lucy Hughes started with the idea of utiltising an existing waste stream as a resource for the plastic, and turned to organic fish waste from the fish processing industry - it's plentiful and ongoing, with over 170,000 tons of the stuff is produced annually, so there's not going to be a shortage of it anytime soon.</p>
      <p>MarinaTex is made from a combination of the fish waste would otherwise be incinerated or sent off to landfill site somewhere, and locally sourced redalgae.</p>

      <p>Once you chuck it onto the compost heap, it'll decompose in around four to six weeks, making it ideal for single-use packaging.</p>
      <p>"Young engineers have the passion, awareness and intelligence to solve some of the world’s biggest problems… MarinaTex elegantly solves two problems: the ubiquity of single-use plastic and fish waste. Further research and development will ensure that MarinaTex evolves further, and I hope it becomes part of a global answer to the abundance of single use plastic waste,” said Sir James Dyson himself.</p>
