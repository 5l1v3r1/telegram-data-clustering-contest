      <h1>Republicans once again display giant visual aids at impeachment inquiry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:24:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author">Lia Eustachewich</a></address>
      <p>Republicans have once again showcased a series of visual aids for the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-marie-yovanovitchs-testimony/">second day of the impeachment inquiry</a>.</p>
      <p>Three giant signs were again erected in the back of the room, underscoring key GOP arguments against the process seeking to remove President Trump from office.</p>
      <p>New on Friday was one that read, “I have never seen a direct relationship between investigations and security assistance” — a quote from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko, who on Thursday said US Ambassador Gordon Sondland didn’t explicitly link US military aid to Kiev with Trump’s request that President Volodymyr Zelensky open an investigation into the Bidens.</p>
      <p>The new sign includes a glaring typo, however, referring to Prystaiko as the “Ukrainan” foreign minister.</p>
      <p>The two other visual aids on Friday <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/republicans-use-giant-signs-to-undermine-impeachment-case/">made their first appearance Wednesday</a> — one quoting Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) and another counting the days “since Adam Schiff learned the identity of the whistleblower.” The latter sign was updated to reflect 95 days.</p>
