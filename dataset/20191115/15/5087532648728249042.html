      <p>iOS 13.3 is heading our way soon, and it is set to contain a powerful new security feature. <i>Forbes </i>reported that it will support NFC, USB, and Lightning FIDO2-compliant security keys in Safari.</p>
      <blockquote>The move is revealed in Apple’s release notes for the second developer beta, which says iOS 13.3 supports NFC, USB, and Lightning FIDO2-compliant security keys in Safari. In other words, when the iOS 13.3 update drops, you will able to use physical security keys such as Yubico’s iPhone compatible YubiKey 5Ci–which was previously unavailable to browsers such as Apple’s Safari and Google’s Chrome. However, it could be used with some password manager apps such as 1Password.</blockquote>
