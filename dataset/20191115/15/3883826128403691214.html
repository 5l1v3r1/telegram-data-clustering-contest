        <b>A man who threatened Change UK leader Anna Soubry, referencing the murdered MP Jo Cox, has been jailed for a year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alden Bryce Barlow, 55, of Milton Walk, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, sent a letter to Ms Soubry in her constituency in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>The message read: "Cox was first, you are next" and referred to Ms Soubry as "treacherous" and "worthless".</p>
      <p>He was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court and given a 10-year order preventing him from contacting Ms Soubry.</p>
      <p>He was also ordered not to go near Ms Soubry's constituency address in Nottingham.</p>

      <p>Barlow was traced by his fingerprints on the letter and from CCTV at the post office counter in the Doncaster branch of WH Smith, where he posted it.</p>
      <p>He was then charged with sending a letter conveying a threatening message, which he admitted.</p>
      <p>Chief Crown Prosecutor Gerry Wareham said: "This letter contained a sickening and ominous threat to Ms Soubry, with an explicit reference to the murder of Jo Cox MP in 2016.</p>
      <p>"Ms Soubry and her staff in the constituency office understandably found the message deeply disturbing and highly offensive.</p>
      <p>"What is more, attacks such as this on our elected representatives are attacks on democracy and perpetrators will be prosecuted."</p>
      <p>Jo Cox died in 2016 after she was shot and stabbed while on her way to meet constituents in Birstall, West Yorkshire.</p>
