      <p>Apple is removing all 181 vaping-related apps from the App Store today, reports Axios. <br/><br/>The move comes as the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">investigates</a> a multistate outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury. Vitamin E acetate has been identified as a chemical of concern in THC-containing e-cigarettes.<br/><br/>Here's Apple statement to Axios:<br/><br/>"We take great care to curate the App Store as a trusted place for customers, particularly youth, to download apps. We’re constantly evaluating apps, and consulting the latest evidence, to determine risks to users’ health and well-being."<br/><br/>● "Recently, experts ranging from the CDC to the American Heart Association have attributed a variety of lung injuries and fatalities to e-cigarette and vaping products, going so far as to call the spread of these devices a public health crisis and a youth epidemic."<br/><br/>● "We agree, and we’ve updated our App Store Review Guidelines to reflect that apps encouraging or facilitating the use of these products are not permitted. As of today, these apps are no longer available to download."<br/><br/>More details in the full report linked below...<br/><br/><a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-apple-to-remove-vaping-apps-from-store-8669fd94-e92a-4ce4-a9e2-ce5afa598b67.html">Read More</a></p>
