      <p>A sexting victim has called for schools to take bullying more seriously after years of torment left her battling with an eating disorder and contemplating suicide.</p>
      <p>Megan Hinton, from Hampshire, was tricked into sending a naked photo of herself by bullies when she was just 14.</p>
      <p>She thought she was talking to a boy in the year above, but it turned out to be a girl in her own year who was using his social media accounts to pressure Megan into sending the photo.</p>
      <p>Megan, who had already moved schools once due to bullying, was horrified to receive a Snapchat from the girl with the message ‘ha ha I’ve got you’.</p>
      <p>Bullies spread the photo round school and ‘made sick noises’ at Megan wherever she went, causing the teen to feel ‘disgusting and worthless’.</p>
      <p>Opening up about her ordeal in support anti-bullying week, Megan, now 20, told <a href="http://metro.co.uk/">Metro.co.uk</a>: ‘I was around 12 when it started. I was verbally bullied then it escalated to physical. I was beaten up twice by a boy.</p>

      <p>‘My parents took the decision to move me to a different school in year 10. I was there for a few weeks before the sexting thing happened.</p>

      <p>‘People made sick noises at me constantly. I was made to feel like I was the person in the wrong</p>
      <p>‘Teachers would tell me if you don’t show it bothers you, they will get bored and move on.</p>
      <p>‘They would say things like, boys are just nasty to girls [they like], girls get jealous.  That did not make me feel any better.’</p>
      <p>Megan said teachers at both schools failed to take her complaints seriously.</p>
      <p>She said the bullies didn’t even get ‘so much as a detention’ for sharing the photo of her, let alone legal action.</p>
      <p>When she finally told the school about the incident she was put in isolation, while police led her to believe she was on the sex offenders register.</p>

      <p>Megan said: ‘I believed I was on the sex offenders register until about a year ago because police said I had created and distributed child porn.</p>
      <p>‘I had just moved schools for a fresh start, I did not have any friends. I did not know what trust was I had been so badly bullied.</p>
      <p>‘The thought a boy liked me was flattering. He said he would spread rumours about me if I did not send the photo, it just seemed like the best option.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t even think their parents were told about what they did.’</p>
      <p>The journalism student said she’s spoken to countless victims of sexting and bullying who are told to shrug things off  or made to feel like they are asking for it.</p>
      <p>However, as in Megan’s case, this can have a serious impact on mental health.</p>
      <p>‘Being bullied massively effected my self confidence’ she said.</p>

      <p>‘It seems so trivial now that I am older, but people would make sick noises at me. They would even follow me into the toilet doing it. To think my body made people feel sick, it shattered my self esteem.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think the bullies realised what they did. They thought it was some big joke.</p>
      <p>‘My mum was convinced I would not make it past my 18th birthday. She only told me once I did. I self harmed from Year 8, I had an eating disorder.</p>
      <p>‘If it were not from the support of Childline I would not be here. They talked me out of taking my own life two or three times’.</p>
      <p>Megan contacted the NSPCC’s Childline after seeing a poster about their online counselling service.</p>
      <p>She urged anyone being bullied to do the same, and suggested taking a break from social media when it becomes too much.</p>

      <p>Statistics from the Anti-Bullying Alliance show one if four UK children experience being bullied.</p>

      <p>This week they launched anti-bullying week to spread the message it takes a collective responsibility to stop bullying.</p>
      <p>Marnie Winter-Burke a Childline counsellor, said children as young as eight have expressed suicidal thoughts to her due to bullying</p>

      <p>She told <a href="http://metro.co.uk/">Metro.co.uk</a>: ‘It’s hard to say if bullying is getting worse or just different. Young people are still struggling with this issue. About 14% of children who come to us about bullying are being bullied online. It’s the biggest issue for under 11s.</p>
      <p>‘We do hear from young people that they feel they aren’t being taken seriously. We know teachers are under so much pressure. People just need to be aware of the signs</p>
      <p>‘The impact on their mental health can be tough to hear.</p>
      <p>‘I think it’s up to all of us to listen when young people are speaking out. We need to make sure  they know where to go when they are being bullied,  there needs to be anti-bullying policies in all schools.’</p>
