      <h1>WRU hold talks with Warren Gatland over doping suspicion comments</h1>
      <h2>The WRU have spoken with the former Wales boss after his comments this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:03:11+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:03</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Sands</a></address>
      <p>The Welsh Rugby Union have spoken with former Wales boss Warren Gatland to fully understand the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/warren-gatland-wales-doping-suspicion-17254270">comments he made around doping suspicions</a> this week.</p>
      <p>A statement says the Union is satisfied with the clarity he has provided over the revelations made on an Irish chat show.</p>
      <p>The Kiwi revealed he may have had suspicions about a Wales player doping during his 12-year reign as national head coach based on jokes made by teammates, but later clarified he had no evidence to base any suspicion on.</p>
      <p>The identity of the player the Kiwi was referring to is unknown.</p>
      <p>Gatland had said: "You know I haven’t come across, personally, any players that I've coached from a Wales perspective that I would - well sorry, maybe one."</p>
      <p>Asked by Off The Ball presenter Joe Molloy if he had a suspicion, the former Wales boss said: "Yeah, maybe one, now that I think about it."</p>
      <p>When asked if the person played for Wales, Gatland responded: “He may have done, yeah.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “It’s probably unfair of me to say I had the suspicions [about one of them] because I’ve got no evidence or anything like that.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of like just saying, ‘Is there a possibility?'"</p>
      <p>Asked if he felt it was his role to confront the player, he said: "No, no.</p>
      <p>"It was more like a couple of people making jokes sort of thing."</p>
      <p>“Truth in humour?" the presenter asked.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, exactly,” Gatland responded.</p>
      <p>The WRU have spoken to Gatland since the comments were made and say they are satisfied with their exchange.</p>
      <p>It's understood Welsh rugby bosses are comfortable with the fact Gatland did not escalate the issue at the time because his suspicions were not serious and were based purely on dressing room jokes.</p>
      <p>A WRU spokesman said on Friday: "We've spoken to Warren to understand his comments in their entirety and we are satisfied with the clarity he provided.</p>
      <p>"All appropriate anti-doping protocols and rigorous procedures are in place in Welsh rugby and the WRU are proactive in the delivery of this."</p>
