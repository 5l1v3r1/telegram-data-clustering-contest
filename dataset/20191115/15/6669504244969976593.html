      <p>VERNON, B.C. - British Columbia wood products company Tolko Industries says continuing low lumber prices and high log costs have forced it to schedule a two-week shutdown affecting all its B.C. operations.</p>
      <p>The privately owned, Vernon-based company says the curtailment will run from Dec. 21 to Jan. 6, while the head office will be closed from Dec. 23 to 27.</p>
      <p>A statement on the company website says only essential services will be maintained during the downtime.</p>
      <p>Tolko has operations in the Okanagan, near Kamloops and Williams Lake and a terminal in Richmond.</p>
      <p>The curtailment comes just a week after the company announced the permanent closure of its Kelowna mill, effective in January.</p>
      <p>Troy Connolly, Tolko's vice-president of solid wood, says the B.C.-wide downtime will reduce output by 21 million board feet at its lumber operations and cut 10 million square feet of panel production at its plywood and veneer plants.</p>
      <p>Pino Pucci, vice-president of marketing and sales, said Tolko will do its best to minimize the impact of the shutdown on customers.</p>
      <p>"Our customers are understanding of current market conditions and aware of our ongoing commitment to serve them," he says in the statement.</p>
