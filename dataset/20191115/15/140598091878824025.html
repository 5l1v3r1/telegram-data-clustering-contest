      <p>Leroy Sane’s Manchester City team-mates are increasingly convinced the Germany winger will leave the club for Bayern Munich next year.</p>
      <p>Bayern wanted to sign Sane last summer but those hopes ended when he <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/08/08/manchester-city-fear-leroy-sane-has-damaged-acl-bayern-munich/">ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament</a> in his right knee in August, even if there had been serious doubts about the Bavarian club’s willingness to meet <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/08/01/manchester-city-put-137million-price-tag-leroy-sane-amid-bayern/">City’s minimum £137 valuation.</a></p>
      <p>But the injury has not deterred Bayern in their bid to land Sane and they are thought to be optimistic about their prospects of finally acquiring the player for a smaller sum next summer, when the 23-year-old’s value will drop as he enters the final 12 months of his contract with City.</p>
      <p>City are understood to already be drawing up plans to replace Sane in the event he leaves, with Real Sociedad’s Mikel Oyarzabal one name in the frame, after being frustrated in their efforts to tie the 2018 PFA Young Player of the Year to a new long-term contract. </p>
      <p>Sane’s attributes are highly regarded among his City team-mates but there is now a strong feeling in the dressing room that this will be his final season in Manchester and that his head has been turned by the prospect of joining Bayern and a return home.</p>
      <p>A summer move is considered much more likely at this stage than a transfer in the January window, when Sane is still unlikely to have returned to action.</p>
      <p>Sane has spent time in America undergoing his rehabilitation in the company of City staff after breaking down early in the first half of the Community Shield against Liverpool at Wembley in August.</p>
      <p>Although initially ruled out until March, there is growing optimism he could return to action in February and play a part in the final months of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Sane has faced questions in the past about his attitude and struggled for starts during the second half of last season after falling out of Guardiola’s favour but his potential departure would be a severe blow to City. He has 39 goals in 134 appearances for City since his projected £42m move from Schalke in 2016 and his absence has been felt at times this season.</p>
      <p>Oyarzabal is believed to one potential replacement for Sane. The 22-year-old Spain international - who is contracted to Sociedad until 2024 - reportedly has a €75m (£64m) release clause in his contract with the Basque club.</p>
      <p>City’s director of football, Txiki Begiristain, is a Basque who has strong ties with Sociedad, with whom he started his professional career, emerging from the club’s junior to spend six years in the first team before a move to Barcelona in 1988.</p>
