        <b>During Padmaavat, Ranveer's Khilji walked away with all the awards while Shahid's Rawal Ratan Singh lagged behind. This year, Sasha delivered one of the biggest blockbusters with Kabir Singh and yet again, it's going to be Sasha Vs Ranveer (Gully Boy) for the coveted trophy. As these two battle it out, we can't miss Hrithik Roshan too, who shone with films like Super 30 and WAR</b>

      <p>When Padmaavat released in 2018, moviegoers were enamoured by Ranveer Singh’s Allaudin Khilji and Shahid Kapoor’s Raja Rawal Ratan Singh. However, it was the former’s evil streak that found more takers and awards than the latter’s usoolon wala rajput avatar.</p>
      <p>Post the film’s stupendous success, it was Ranveer’s negative portrayal that became a rage. It was natural for Sasha to feel a bit sidelined and from his interviews back then, it was evident that he was upset for not getting the screen space and importance that Khilji got in the film. In fact, he had even stated that if he had to essay the brutal ruler’s role, he would have probably played it differently. No two second thoughts on that, Shahid, we all know you’re a fabulous performer!</p>

      <p>Right from his debut film Ishq Vishk to movies like Jab We Met, Kaminey, Udta Punjab and Haider, to name just a few, the actor time and again proved his mettle as a terrific performer. While he had anticipated Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Padmaavat to boost his career at an all-time high, it was Kabir Singh that did it for him.</p>
      <p>Vijay Deverakonda’s Hindi remake of the South hit Arjun Reddy, gave the man his first solo blockbuster and undoubtedly, today, Shahid has regained his position in the film industry. On the other hand, Ranveer Singh who has been a powerhouse performer from the onset, is indeed riding high on the laurels of his successful films and fab performances.</p>

      <p>This year, where Shahid gave us a Kabir Singh, Ranveer gave us Gully Boy. Two diversely different subjects but both were strong characters in their own rights. Ranveer and Shahid yet again will be pitted against each other for the coveted awards this time. Ranveer’s Gully Boy has already been nominated for the Oscars and his role of an underdog found an instant connect with the audiences. But, Sasha’s flawed yet strong portrayal as Kabir Singh, won hearts and also became a topic of discussion.</p>
      <p>All not said and done, let’s now talk about Hrithik Roshan who shone in films like Super 30 and WAR. The former saw him ace the role of mathematician Anand Kumar. And the latter, saw him turn into an ultimate Greek God. You can say, 2019 has been a good year for the handsome actor and he can’t be missed out from the list.</p>

      <p>Now, with 2019 coming to a close and the award season just round the corner, we want to ask you: Will Shahid clinch the trophy for Kabir Singh, will it be Ranveer Singh for Gully Boy or Hrithik Roshan for Super 30?</p>
