'A' and 'S' do not even know main offender '<b>K</b>', and they were already suffering due to 'K's fraud. 'The Fact' failed to fact check their relationship and reported false news, leading to greater damage."<br/><br/></i>A criminal complaint has been filed against the media outlet, and 'A' and 'S' plan to take civil action should false information continue to be reported. <br/><br/>Stay tuned for updates.</p>
