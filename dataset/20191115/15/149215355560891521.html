      <h1>Trump blows Republicans' entire Yovanovitch hearing strategy with a single tweet</h1>

      <p>If Republicans had one goal going into the House Intelligence Committee's hearing with former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, it was <i>do not be on the attack</i>. Democrats' strategy on Friday hinged on painting Yovanovitch as a "sympathetic victim of bullying by [Rudy] Giuliani and the president, whose decision to pull her from Ukraine helped set the stage for the campaign to pressure that country's president," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><i>The New York Times</i> reports</a>. Republicans, naturally, did not want to give their opponents more ammo.</p>
      <p>And then Trump tweeted:</p>

      <p>Trump's tweet completely undermined the Republican strategy. For one thing, the tweet made clear that he did in fact single Yovanovitch out — which is exactly what the Democrats' line of question was intended to prove. Additionally, "Republicans did not want to attack Yovanovitch personally, just to portray her as a distraction from the main events," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-impeachment-hearing.html?action=click&amp;module=STYLN_trump_playbook&amp;variant=1_trump_playbook&amp;state=default&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=header&amp;context=menu">noted <i>The New York Times</i>' Nicholas Fandos</a>. What's more, the Democrats' lawyer <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1195358285404262402">specifically undercut Trump's line of attack</a> by asking Yovanovitch if anyone in the State Department "ever expressed concern about your job performance," to which the former ambassador answered "no."</p>
      <p>Trump's tweets also directly contradicted the White House, which <a href="https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1195346848300617728">had claimed earlier in the day</a> that "the president will be watching [Republican Rep. Devin] Nunes' opening statement, but the rest of the day he will be working hard for the American people."</p>
