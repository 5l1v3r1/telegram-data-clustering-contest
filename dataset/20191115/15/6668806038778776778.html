      <p>There are some actors, whom you admire for their talent. There are some, who leave you charmed by their good-looks. Some floor you with their off-screen persona. But rarely do you come across someone, who ticks all the boxes. Ayushmann Khurrana is one such. I’ve known him before his first film Vicky Donor and my affection and respect for him has only grown with every year.  His success story is a template for inspiration. He’s the hero of the common man. Resonating their unspoken issues, resolving their dilemmas, celebrating their imperfections, he seeks the extraordinary in the ordinary. He’s also the only actor in the country who’s got the pulse of the mass and the class. Mumbai or Mathura... Ayushmann‘s films have a pan India appeal now. Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Badhaai Ho, AndhaDhun, Article 15, Dream Girl and now Bala… eight hits in a row… Ayushmann is the vanguard of new-age cinema – unencumbered, unapologetic, unconventional.

      <p>Right mind, right heart</p>
      <p>Script is the superstar for him. The synergy of instinct and intellect has put Ayushmann on the success map. An outsider, who had to work doubly hard to make inroads, Ayushmann cracked the formula early in his career. He had to be different to stand out. He culled out taboo subjects and made them dinner table conversations. A sperm donor, a guy suffering from erectile dysfunction, a man impersonating a woman, a balding youngster, a homosexual... Ayushmann has his ear to the ground. In speaking the jargon of the common man, he forged a connect. Few months ago, sitting in a hotel suite in Mumbai, he mentioned, “I’ve realised my biggest talent lies in selecting scripts. If I listen to myself and don’t take too many opinions, I’m in the best situation. My first reaction is always organic. I listen to the script as the guy from Chandigarh, who’s sitting in the theatre and enjoying the film. That helps me decide.”</p>

      <p>Fortune favours the brave </p>
      <p>Taking a risk with your first film would seem a petrifying proposition. But Ayushmann had the beginner’s luck with Vicky Donor. His gamble paid off. The audience loved him and the actor cum singer won two Filmfare Awards, one for the impressive debut and the other for his soulful track, Paani da, in the film. Things became a little shaky post that. He fell for the commercial trap, took the conventional route and lost his way – albeit temporarily. Thankfully, epiphany happened soon. He figured how to sieve the chaff from the grain. He once told an interesting anecdote about Dum Laga Ke Haisha (DLKH), the second-coming in his career. He shared, “I was asked to read the script of DLKH. I was so floored by it that I called Aditya Chopra and said, ‘Sir I want to do this film’. He said, ‘Kya baat kar raha hai! Are you serious? You’re doing a bigger film, Bewakoofiyan, where you’re the hero. And you’re choosing the one in which you’re the loser! But I insisted I wanted to do it. He said, ‘Chal theek hai, tu karle!’ And the rest is history. Dum Laga Ke... made him the common man’s hero. Bareilly Ki Barfi and Shubh Mangal Saavdhan cemented his position further and made him a bankable star. AndhaDhun, Badhaai Ho, Article 15 and the recent Dream Girl and Bala, have not only endorsed his versatility but have anointed him as the poster boy of cinema that’s middle-of-the road yet mainstream. He’s someone who pleases the critics and also ensures the crores. Now that’s a rare species.</p>

      <p>The future is bright </p>
      <p>Sometime last year, Ayushmann told me, “I’d love to do a film on homosexuality. That’s on my radar. I should be the first one to do it. A mainstream film on homosexuality should happen as soon as possible. But it cannot be serious. It must be entertaining and fun. I’d like to send out a strong message in a fun way, just like in my previous films.” And that happened! With Shubh Mangal Zyaada Saavdhan, he’s going to be the first big Bollywood actor to do a mainstream film on homosexuality. What’s more, it will liberate alternate sexuality from the closet and give it a mass reception. His other film, Shoojit Sircar’s Gulabo Sitabo, in which he’s sharing screen with Amitabh Bachchan, is already one of the most-awaited films of next year.</p>

      <p>Heart of gold </p>
      <p>Coming to his off-screen persona, there’s an unrehearsed affability about him. He’s one star, who carries his popularity nonchalantly. Credit that to his poetic side, his tryst with music, his struggle… He could well be called ‘the monk who bought a Ferrari’. Ayushmann’s witnessed the highs and lows at close quarters and hence hasn’t allowed the frills of the flamboyant profession become his fulcrum. He’s a realist, a humanist. He remains the boy from Chandigarh, who celebrates the wonderment of life. Who enjoys the limelight but is aware of the shadows beneath. I’ve seen him interact with his fans with sheer love and respect. A few years back he had shared, “I still remember the first time someone asked me for an autograph and a picture. It was a special feeling. I couldn’t sleep the whole night. Today, how can I be rude and say no to a photograph? I make it a point to give a picture to as many people as possible. I started young, I’ve seen everything and I’ve absorbed that. Believe me, success is a lousy teacher. It’s only the failures that teach you and help you grow as a person. And then when you get success again, you have to remain level-headed.”</p>

      <p>Ayushmann is not just a maverick actor. He’s an adventurist when it comes to fashion too. The promotions of his films see him rock the most unconventional looks with panache. His social media game is prolific too. From heart felt poems to snacky selfies... he’s mastered the art of engagement and interaction. Leaving behind the splendour of stardom outside the threshold of his home, in the warm confines within, he’s the perfect family man. A caring and committed husband to wife and filmmaker Tahira Kashyap, who recently faced a health scare and a super dad to kids Virajveer and Varushka… Ayushmann’s love for them is sacrosanct.  Now can we give Ayushmann the Man of the Year award please?</p>
