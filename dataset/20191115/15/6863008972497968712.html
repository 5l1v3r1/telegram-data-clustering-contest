      <p>Deputy Head of Ukraine's Presidential Office Yuliya Kovaliv says she discussed current issues related to the reform of country's railway industry with representatives from the Infrastructure Ministry, Ukraine's national railways company PJSC Ukrzaliznytsia, and the Trade Union of Railway Workers and Transport Builders.</p>
      <p>"We see that the railways and the entire rail transport sector are driving economic growth," Kovaliv said, the Presidential Office's press service told UNIAN on November 15.</p>
      <p>The official assured that Ukrzaliznytsia employees' interests would be taken into account when reforming the company.</p>
      <p>"Representatives of the trade unions will certainly be involved in the discussion of a plan for restructuring the railways to take into account the interests of <a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10702704-ukraine-s-infrastructure-ministry-wants-to-split-ukrzaliznytsia-into-three-companies.html">Ukrzaliznytsia</a> workers as much as possible," she said.</p>
      <p>Kovaliv also noted the need to hold a dialogue with the trade unions about certain facilities of the company's non-core assets for their possible sale.</p>
      <p>The meeting also agreed to include representatives of the trade union in an ad hoc group that is finalizing a draft law on rail transport in Ukraine.</p>
