      <h1>Deontay Wilder should stop Luis Ortiz again - but he won't have it all his own way</h1>
      <h2>Wilder takes on Ortiz for a second time next weekend as he looks to remain on track for a rematch with Tyson Fury next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:53:39+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Barry McGuigan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/barry-mcguigan/</a></address>
      <p>Other than getting older I’m not sure much has changed for Deontay Wilder or Luis Ortiz since they first met 20 months ago.</p>
      <p>Ortiz has turned 40 and moves like he’s 50. He is not helped by an appetite for work that is, let’s say, on the laissez faire side of optimised.</p>
      <p>At 34 with 42 bouts behind him Wilder is what he is, which might have been a problem were he facing the young Ortiz.</p>
      <p>As a kid in Cuba Ortiz would have been up againt ten others just as good in his division. That makes you sharp and teaches you respect for the game.</p>
      <p>In Cuba boxing gives you lifestyle and status. There is every incentive to succeed. Outside of that environment you have to find the reasons to be good and to keep working hard.</p>
      <p>But emptying the tank in training in Miami, where Ortiz is tempted by every distraction known to man, is not guaranteed.</p>

      <p>I’m not sure Ortiz has the dedication he once had. In shape he would be a real threat.</p>
      <p>He had Wilder in all sorts of trouble in Brooklyn before the Bronze Bomber ultimately blasted his way out of the crisis.</p>
      <p>Wilder retains his tremendous power but his defence has not improved. He is still hitable and has not got the best chin.</p>
      <p>And, since Wilder telegraphs those big shots, the best fighters see them coming. He lifts his elbows every time he lines up a big punch.</p>
      <p>On top of that Wilder does not know how to close the ring down effectively. That’s why he struggled to look good against Tyson Fury.</p>

      <p>He should watch tapes of Vasyl Lomachenko. No-one makes the ring smaller.</p>
      <p>Next week’s engagement in Las Vegas is effectively part of the holding pattern until the stakeholders get Wilder and Fury back in the ring. We are told February is a goer.</p>
      <p>The first fight came to life only when Wilder finally caught up with Fury. Instead of cutting the ring down he just followed Fury around and as a consequence was never close enough to get his shots off.</p>
      <p>It made for a boring fight rescued by a brilliant ending. Ideally Wilder makes a statement by knocking out Ortiz early to build anticiapation.</p>
      <p>I think Wilder will find him eventually but don’t be surprised if he gets caught doing so, just like last time.</p>
