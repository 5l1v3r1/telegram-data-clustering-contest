      <p>In addition to her unique jacket, Hadid also wore pointed leather boots, and trousers that had an uneven waistline held up by criss-cross strings that extended across her stomach.</p>
      <p>She shared a photo of her look on Instagram, where she also thanked French Vogue for inviting her to its event.</p>
      <p>“This morning, about to speak at the Vogue Paris French Vogue Fashion Festival with Loïc Prigent about my career, how it started, the progression, and my passions,” she wrote. “Humbled to speak with you and thank you Emmanuelle Alt for having me on such an important day!”</p>

      <p>Though we’re only 15 days into the month, Hadid’s recent ensemble is one of many bold looks she’s worn recently.</p>
      <p>On November 4, for example, she attended the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Awards in New York City wearing a velvet bodysuit. The Alexander Wang piece was embellished with strategically-placed pearls, which <a href="https://www.insider.com/bella-hadid-body-piercing-outfit-2019-11">resembled stomach and nipple piercings</a>.</p>
      <p>Two days later, on November 6, the model paired a fuzzy, animal-print bucket hat with a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7655529/Bella-Hadid-arrives-Heathrow-airport-carrying-iconic-6-850-Chanel-bag.html">$6,850 messenger bag</a> from Chanel.</p>
