      <p>How I Succeeded is a regular series on Lifehacker where we ask business leaders for the secrets and tactics behind their success. Today: Inara Gravitis, Chief Development Officer at KFC South Pacific.</p>
      <p><b>Current gig: </b>Chief Development Officer at KFC South Pacific</p>
      <p><b>Current location: </b>Sydney, Australia</p>
      <p><b>Current mobile device: </b>iPhone 10</p>
      <p><b>Current computer: </b>Dell laptop</p>
      <p><b>One word that best describes how you work: </b>Fast-paced</p>
      <h3>What apps/software/tools can't you live without?</h3>
      <p>Strava is absolutely number one and my Garmin Connect. Also, the weather app and of course, the KFC app because I love my KFC.</p>
      <h3>What social network do you find the most useful?</h3>
      <p>WhatsApp.</p>
      <h3>What were the most important lessons you learned while growing your business?</h3>
      <p>I think just having honest conversations. Put everything on the table and have an honest conversation, even if it's difficult because that's how you move on.</p>
      <h3>What has been the most surprising part of your business journey?</h3>
      <p>Well, I'm an accountant so didn't think I would end up opening stores, opening restaurants and especially, opening new concepts like this [KFC's new concept store in Newcastle's Broadmeadow]. So, the ability to have experiences where you never thought you'd be.</p>
      <h3>What everyday thing are you better at than anyone else?</h3>
      <p>What's a good answer there? So many things I want to say. Probably cuddling my kids.</p>
      <h3>What's your sleep routine like?</h3>
      <p>I just need six-and-a-half hours. As long as I get it, I'm happy.</p>
      <h3>What advice would you offer to other businesses on how to succeed?</h3>
      <p>I think don't be afraid of making a mistake. That's how you learn.</p>
