      <h1>Man Utd transfer target Erling Haaland sent warning over making big move</h1>
      <h2>The Norwegian's former coach believes the striker is not ready to play for clubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool</h2>

      <p>Erling Braut Haaland's former youth coach has warned that the striker is not yet ready to play for clubs such as Bayern Munich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Haaland has risen to prominence this season with a number of excellent performances in front of goal for Austrian side RB Salzburg.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has scored 26 goals in just 18 appearances, with seven of those strikes coming in the Champions League group stages to make him the top scorer in the competition.</p>
      <p>Although he only joined Salzburg from Molde in January, it has already been suggested that another move to one of Europe's top clubs could be on the horizon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly sent his most trusted scout to monitor the Norwegian, who is also understood to have caught the eye of the likes of Liverpool and Bayern.</p>

      <p>But Alf Ingve Berntsen, who worked with Haaland in the early stages of his career at Bryne FK, believes it would be wrong for the forward to make the step up to one of Europe's elite clubs at this stage of his career - insisting he is not yet at the level of someone like Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski.</p>
      <p>“The tactical requirements at Bayern and Liverpool would be a bit too high for now," Berntsen told <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-is-far-from-lewandowskis-level-strikers-former-coach/1ntiu53zvbqhy1a5bfb8zte4ly">Goal</a> and <a href="https://www.spox.com/de/sport/fussball/bundesliga/1911/Artikel/haaland-jugendtrainer-exklusiv-wechsel-zum-fc-bayern-die-anforderungen-waeren-zu-hoch.html">SPOX</a> . "After all, he has only played in Norway and Austria so far. And also there for a short time.</p>
      <p>“Joining Bayern would be difficult for him at the moment. Because, of course, he still some way to go before he reaches the level of Robert Lewandowski.</p>
      <p>“Erling is a dominant character, sitting on the bench would not be easy for him.</p>

      <p>"As long as Lewandowski plays at this level, a move to Bayern would therefore not make sense."</p>
      <p>Although goals against the likes of Napoli and Liverpool in the Champions League have provided indications that Haaland has what it takes to perform at the top level, Berntsen feels that remaining with Salzburg for the time-being would be best for the teenager's development.</p>
      <p>“What many forget: Haaland was not even a regular player at Salzburg recently," he added. "He did not play regularly until August this year.</p>

      <p>"Of course he caused hype with his goals, but it would probably be advisable to stay at Salzburg for another year.</p>
      <p>“The most important thing for Erling is to play regularly at the highest possible level. It would be bad for him not to play at his new club.</p>
      <p>"He needs playing time at the highest level in order to evolve. To be a substitute at a top club would be a hindrance to this development.”</p>
