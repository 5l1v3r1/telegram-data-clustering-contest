      <p>Filming is underway in Australia for the new series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>Pictures from behind the scenes <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/im-celebrity-out-here-confirmed-17241089">reveal the celebs taking part in this year's series</a> are already being faced with intense challenges.</p>
      <p>After arriving for the start of filming, this season's 10 contestants - Nadine Coyle, Caitlyn Jenner, Kate Garraway, Jacqueline Jossa, Roman Kemp, Ian Wright, Myles Stephenson, Andrew Maxwell, James Haskell and Adele Parks - were divided into pairs.</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec also joined in the action, after arriving in a speedboat, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-celebrity-stars-braver-ever-20885994">Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>They've been photographed with the contestants, who began the contest with a swim challenge.</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier this week, series producer Olly Nash said contestants will also return to the 32-storey Focus building where the stars will walk the plank.</p>

      <p>He said: "This is I’m A Celebrity and the contestants are going to have to be braver than ever.</p>
      <p>"The walk in itself will see us return to the plank at the Focus building. It’s the biggest and most horrendous, wobbliest thing. We tested it earlier in August and we made it deliberately more wobbly.</p>
      <p>"They will be playing with another celebrity, so the more they wobble, the more you wobble. You are totally dependent on someone else. It’s 343ft up, four metres out, then three metres down, then a metre out again.</p>
      <p>"You have to go down a ladder. We’ve tested it and during the runs, getting to the end then turning around is absolutely horrendous. The worst part of it is you have to go a metre out at the bottom and effectively stand on one foot to press the switch. You’re balancing on one foot."</p>

      <p>Olly added: "It’s absolutely terrifying. I find it hard just looking over the edge. It’s totally down to how brave you are.</p>
      <p>"It’s survival of the bravest. The bravest will win out. You’ve got to hold your nerve."</p>
