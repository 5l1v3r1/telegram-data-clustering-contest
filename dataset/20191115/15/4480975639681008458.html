      <p>According to a Panelbase poll published on Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Paty widened the gap with the Labour Party to 13 points this week, as reported by Reuters.</p>
      <p>Panelbase sees the Conservative Party getting 43%, 3 points higher than the 40% announced last week, while Labour stays unchanged at 30%. </p>
      <p>The British pound's reaction to the poll was muted with the GBP/USD pair clinging to small daily gains above the 1.2900 handle and remaining on track to end the week modestly higher. </p>
