      <p>The Pittsburgh Penguins' injury situation has gone from bad to worse, as their biggest star, Sidney Crosby, has been placed on injured reserve.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/kris-letang-injury-update-pittsburgh-penguins-defenseman-out-week-to-week/1grhxmxhac0ht1c5zluv5y0cov">Kris Letang</a>and<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/11/03/Penguins-Patric-Hornqvist-injured-reserve-Brian-Dumoulin-Dominik-Kahun/stories/201911030208">Patric Hornqvist</a>already sidelined with injuries — <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/penguins-evgeni-malkin-returns-from-ir-will-play-saturday-vs-oilers/f5hl1l5tf34q12f9hrg9uwai1">and Malkin recently returning</a> aftermissing 11 games with a leg injury —the Penguins now see another major blow to the lineup with Crosby out of the mix for the foreseeable future. The Pittsburgh captain has been dealing with a sports hernia and made the decision to undergo surgery.</p>
      <p>While thelocker room has <a href="https://twitter.com/OtherNHLCrosby/status/1193375939230601218">seen its fair share of injuries so far to start 2019-20</a>, the team is barely holding on to a wild-card spot, and being without another key piece of the puzzle is going to make their upcoming run difficult. In turn, the Penguins will look to Malkin to lead the way, as well as the likes ofJake Guentzel, Alex Galchenyuk and Nick Bjustadto step up and fill the void left by the 32-year-old center.</p>

      <p>In the third period of the Pens'3-2 shootout win over the Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday, the 5-11, 200-pound forward was skating into the offensive zonewhen, while trying not to collide with a backchecking Erik Gustafsson, skated into the Blackhawks' defender's skate.
