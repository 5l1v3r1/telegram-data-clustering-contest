      <h2>‘Disunity in KC(M), Congress led to reversal in byelections’</h2>

      <p>The United Democratic Front (UDF) leadership has decided to hold bilateral discussions with the two factions of the Kerala Congress(M) in its bid to end the ongoing feud at least before the local body elections due next year.</p>
      <p>The UDF liaison committee, which held a day-long sitting at Neyyar Dam, near here on Friday, expressed concern at the disunity in the Kerala Congress (M) and the Congress as a result of which the coalition had to suffer electoral reverses in the recent byelections. The first round of bilateral talk was held on Thursday and another round was held soon after the UDF meeting.</p>
      <p>The two faction leaders Jose K. Mani and P.J. Joseph reportedly clashed at the meeting, with the former asserting that he had abided by the UDF decision not to precipitate matters during the byelections. To this, Mr. Joseph said that he had been insistent on a winning candidate from Pala and that he was insulted at the KC(M) election convention. He also justified his decisions on allotting the party symbol.</p>
      <p>It was clear that the UDF leadership did not want the differences between Mr. Mani and Mr. Joseph to undermine the coalition unity. The Pala seat was lost because of the faction fight, while the Vattiyurkavu and Konni seats were lost due to the disunity in the Congress.</p>
      <p>Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the issues in the Congress would be over within a week. The party would nominate its chairpersons and conveners in the districts. The various UDF committees would be reconstituted right from the local body to the district level.</p>
      <p>The meeting decided to strengthen its ongoing agitation against the State and Central governments. As part of this, the UDF will hold a demonstration in front of district collectorates and the Secretariat on December 12. The meeting also set up a committee, headed by former KPCC president M.M. Hassan, to work on the preparations for the local body elections.</p>
