      <p><b>China</b> on Thursday unveiled an <b>experiment</b> simulating the process of a probe hovering, avoiding obstacles and descending to land on Mars.</p>
      <p>The <b>experiment</b> was held on a trial ground, the largest in Asia for test <b>landing</b> on extraterrestrial bodies, in Huailai County, north <b>China</b>'s Hebei Province, Xinhuanet reported.</p>
      <p><b>China</b> plans to send the probe to <b>Mars</b> in 2020. At the moment, one of the biggest challenges is how to get the machine to land safely because the red planetâ€™s gravity is about one-third that of Earth.</p>
      <p>Ambassadors and diplomats from 19 countries, including France, Italy and Brazil, as well as representatives of the European Union, the African Union and the Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization, attended the experiment.</p>
