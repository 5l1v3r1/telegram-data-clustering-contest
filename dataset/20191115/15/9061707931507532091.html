      <h1>'Impressing' - The players who could save Derby County millions in January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>Derby County transfer news | Could Phillip Cocu look to use these players rather than dip into the transfer market?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:11:49+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Derby County are no doubt preparing to use the forthcoming <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-toney-3542124">January transfer window </a>to bolster their squad and push for a strong second half of the season.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>are currently 16th in the Sky Bet Championship after an up-and-down start to Phillip Cocu’s first season in charge.</p>
      <p>Clubs in the Premier League and the Championship are currently in the midst of the final international break of the year, with the Rams back in action with a home game against high-flying Preston North End on November 23.</p>
      <p>After that, Derby face a gruelling run of fixtures up until January that could make or break their season.</p>
      <p>As such, the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-january-transfer-staff-3317854">transfer market</a> may be a way of increasing the club’s chances of success this season – but what about players already at Pride Park that could save the Rams the trouble of venturing into the unknown realm of the January transfer window?</p>
      <p>We take a look at some of the club's youngsters who could save Derby millions in the transfer market.</p>

      <h3>Lee Buchanan</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>It is no secret that Derby are getting short of numbers in the defensive areas of the pitch.</p>
      <p>On-loan centre-back Matt Clarke suffered a knee injury in the defeat at Nottingham Forest and the club are unsure when he will be fit again.</p>
      <p>And following the sacking of club skipper Richard Keogh last month, Derby are left with limited resources in central defence.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/phillip-cocu">Phillip Cocu</a> could opt to look at 18-year-old defender <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/lee-buchanan-say-after-dream-3208091">Lee Buchanan</a>, who was involved in the first-team in the early weeks of the season.</p>
      <p>He played the full 90 minutes in the 1-1 draw with West Bromwich Albion in August, but was then replaced at half time of the following match against Brentford with the Rams 3-0 down.</p>
      <p>Buchanan has not featured for the first team since that defeat at Griffin Park, and has instead been a regular figure for Darren Wassall’s Under-23s.</p>
      <p>The young defender has the ability to play either as a left-back or centre-half, and could provide Cocu with an option going forward if numbers in those positions become light.</p>
      <h3>Louie Sibley</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.derbytelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article3535877.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_AC_TEM_131119_DerbyCountyU23_sVsLeedsUnitedU23_s_352.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/louie-sibley">Louie Sibley</a> has been impressing for the Rams’ Under-23s for a couple of years now.</p>
      <p>He scored a <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-louie-sibley-leeds-3539656">hat-trick and certainly caught the eye in a 7-1 thrashing of Leeds</a> in the Premier League Cup clash at Loughborough University Stadium on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Playing in the centre of midfield is his trademark, and often the provider of goals for his team mates, although he is capable of finding the back of the net as he did against Leeds.</p>
      <p>Sibley was awarded his first-team debut in the Carabao Cup first round win over Scunthorpe United, and was then used in the following round against Nottingham Forest. Those two appearances remain Sibley’s only outings for the first-team this season.</p>
      <p>Cocu has been using Krystian Bielik and <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-shinnie-3541480">Graeme Shinnie</a> in the holding midfield, but Clarke’s injury may force the Poland international to drop into centre-back.</p>
      <p>If Cocu is short of options in the centre of midfield, or would like to dip into the transfer market for someone who can play in the middle of the park, then he could do worse than turning to Sibley.</p>
      <h3>Jason Knight</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Another product of the Derby academy, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/jason-knight">Jason Knight</a> could provide Cocu with a further midfield option going forward.</p>
      <p>Knight has been a frequent figure in the Rams first-team this season, coming on as a substitute against Huddersfield Town on the opening day to make his first-team debut.</p>
      <p>He has since go on to nine appearances under Cocu this term, three of which have come as a starter, and has caught the eye of Rams supporters.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old was recently in action for his country, as he made his first competitive appearance for the Republic of Ireland’s Under-21 side as they claimed a 1-0 win over Armenia.</p>
      <p>Like Sibley, Knight catches the eye when he is on the ball and works hard for his team in the busiest area of the pitch.</p>
      <p>Cocu may look to utilise the 18-year-old in the remaining matches this season, whether that be in the Championship or the FA Cup which starts for Derby in January.</p>
      <h3>Morgan Whittaker</h3>

        <figcaption>Morgan Whittaker scores for Derby County against FC Minsk in their UEFA Youth League tie at Loughborough University Stadium<cite>(Image: Andy Clarke)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Another success from Derby’s academy is striker <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/phillip-cocu-explains-decision-bring-3471090">Morgan Whittaker</a>, who is no stranger to finding the back of the net.</p>
      <p>During the 2018/19 season, the 18-year-old scored 20 goals in 26 appearances collectively for Derby’s Under-18 and Under-23 sides.</p>
      <p>Since Cocu’s appointment, the Dutchman has been keen to give Derby’s young players an opportunity to perform.</p>
      <p>Whittaker was awarded his first-team debut after coming on as a late substitute in the Cup win over Scunthorpe in August.</p>
      <p>His first league outing came last month when the striker replaced Kieran Dowell in the 2-0 defeat to Hull City at the KCOM Stadium.</p>
      <p>Cocu has Jack Marriott, Martyn Waghorn and Chris Martin as his more experienced first-team forwards, but should the Rams boss decide to go down a different route then Whittaker could provide Derby with success.</p>
