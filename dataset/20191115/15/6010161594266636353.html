      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:06:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Donaldson</a></address>
      <p>Pokemon abilities and moves are a major part of any battle, and in <b>Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield</b> there are a range of <b>new abilities</b> and <b>new moves</b> you’ll find attached to certain newcomers and returning creatures alike.</p>
      <h3>New Abilities for Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield</h3>
      <p>Adding new abilities is a tradition with each new generation of Pokemon games, and Sword &amp; Shield is no different in this regard. While existing skills that fans will be familiar with from throughout the rest of the Pokemon series will also be present in Sword &amp; Shield, probably what’s most interesting of all are the new abilities that come attached to some of the new Pokemon in the game. A few old Pokemon also get new abilities in this game, too – Mr. Mime, Koffing and Weezing all sport new abilities, while the Galarian form of Ponyta and Rapidash likewise level up with a new ability.</p>
      <p>These abilities range greatly, and some of them – such as Libero, which resembles a previous ability, are likely to become competitive-worthy skills. Others, like Hunger Switch or Ice Face, are key to the way an entire Pokemon plays, giving that Pokemon a very unique battle mechanic. Here’s the full list of new Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield Abilities:</p>
      <h3>Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield - New Abilities List</h3>
