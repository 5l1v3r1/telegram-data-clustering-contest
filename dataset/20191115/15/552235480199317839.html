      <p>Pug lovers in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> will be able to do their bit for a charity dedicated to improving the lives of these adorable little pooches.</p>
      <p>A St Andrew's Day Tartan Tea Party will be held in Greenhills community hall on Saturday, November 30 in aid of the MuffinPug Rescue charity.</p>
      <p>There will be lots of stalls, raffles, a fun dog show, Hug-a-Pug, tea, coffee, cakes and hot snacks.</p>
      <p>And you can find out all about the rescue charity and how you can help as well as some Muffin Pugs being on hand to raise awareness of the issues they face.</p>
      <p>MuffinPug Rescue is a breed specific rescue across the UK that is dedicated to actively rescuing pugs and pug crosses in need.</p>
      <p>As the breed has become increasingly more fashionable over the years, it has meant that many pugs have been exploited and mistreated in order to meet the growing demand.</p>
      <p>As a registered UK charity it aims to end the suffering of neglected pugs through a network of volunteers called Fairy Pug Mothers and Fathers with the core aim of rescuing and rehabilitating pugs within a home foster environment, before they live long happy lives in their forever homes.</p>

      <p>They also look to educate adopters and owners on how to care and look after a pug.</p>
      <p>And every dog that arrives MuffinPug Rescue visits one one of its trusted vets to have a full check up, including a blood test.</p>
      <p>The charity attempt to never rehome a dog that is unspayed or neutered, to ensure that they can never be abused with excessive and inappropriate breeding.</p>

      <p>Mo Ferguson, a supporter of the charity in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride,</a> said: "A person in the town has a rescue pug from the charity and she was also doing home checks to find suitable homes for rescue pugs. The dog is called Ivy and has only one eye because she wasn't looked after properly as a pup.</p>
      <p>"Also many of us here in East Kilbride support this charity. The tea party is a chance for the people of the town to find out more about the charity and perhaps become a fosterer or adopter of a pug.</p>
      <p>"Everyone loves a pug, but why shop for a pug when you can adopt one and give it the life it deserves."</p>
      <p>The tea party starts at 2pm and entry is £2 for an adult with children and dogs free.</p>
