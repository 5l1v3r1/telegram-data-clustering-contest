      <p>GTA Online players can now build their very own wave-based King of the Hill and Survival Modes.</p>
      <p>Rockstar has introduced the Survival Creator and King of the Hill Creator, allowing you to create your very own modes in <b>GTA Online</b>.</p>
      <p>With the Survival Creator, you can build wave-based Survival Modes with options to “place props and spawn points, control enemy combat proficiency, vehicle spawns,” and more.</p>
      <p>There’s also the new King of the Hill Creator, where you can place props and capture points. You can choose from stationary areas, item pickups or even driveable vehicles in either team-based or free-for-all variants.</p>
      <p>Once created, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61228/Create-Your-Own-Survival-and-King-of-the-Hill-Modes-in-GTA-Online">you can publish these modes</a> via the Social Club for the community to discover.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the modes, both are handing out double rewards this week. Just hit up the rolling playlist and jump in.</p>

      <p>This week you can also take 25% off Gunrunning Supplies and enjoy a 50% boost in Gunrunning Research Speed. You will also earn double on Gunrunning Sell Missions through November 20. Any Mobile Operations Mission will also pay out double rewards.</p>
      <p>Paying a visit this week to the Diamond Casino &amp; Resort and giving the Lucky Wheel a spin could win you the top price: the Ocelot Stromberg. It’s a submersible two-seater and rather cool. As always, you can also win new duds and GTA$. There are also new items in the casino shop this week, so go have a browse.</p>
      <p>Finally, this week you can enjoy discounts on various armor, military vehicles, properties and more.</p>
