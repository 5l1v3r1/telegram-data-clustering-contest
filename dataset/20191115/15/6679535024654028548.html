      <p>TIRUCHI</p>
      <p>Much to the relief of the section of faculty members in constituent colleges who receive remuneration on hourly basis, Bharathidasan University has complied with their request for grant of experience certificate to enable those with the requisite qualifications to apply for the post of assistant professors in government colleges.</p>
      <p>Since the Teachers' Recruitment Board has allotted 15 marks for experience, at the rate of two marks per year, with a cap of 7.5 years as maximum duration, as many as 57 out of 215 teachers appointed on hourly-basis were in a fix. The 57 teachers with NET/SLET and Ph.D. qualifications will now be in a position to cite the years of experience in their applications, M.S. Bala Murugan, State General Secretary of Association of University Teachers, which took up the grievance of the faculty members with the university, said.</p>
      <p>A majority of the faculty members in the constituent colleges comprise guest lecturers, teachers appointed on hourly basis and teachers appointed by parent-teacher associations. Hitherto, the university used to provide experience certificates only to guest lecturers.</p>
      <p>Though the hourly-basis teachers work for 18 hours per week, only 10 hours a week has been considered for the purpose of experience, similar to the case of teachers appointed on consolidated pay.</p>
      <p>But, for the teachers appointed on hourly basis, at the rate of ₹ 300 per hour, the monthly remuneration does not exceed ₹ 12,000 irrespective of the number of hours of work they put in. Guest faculty on consolidated pay also who work for 18 hours a week are paid in three slabs: ₹ 12,000 per month for those with only M.Phil qualification,₹ 13,000 for NET/SLET qualified teachers and ₹ 15,000 for those with Ph.D. qualification.</p>
      <p>Unlike in the case of guest lecturers, teachers appointed on hourly basis also have to undergo break in employment for the months of May and November. The system of appointing teachers on hourly basis is prevalent only in Bharathidasan University in Tamil Nadu. The university must consider inclusion of hourly-basis teachers as guest lecturers, Prof. Bala Murugan emphasised.</p>
