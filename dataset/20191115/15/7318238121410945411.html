      <p>The White House released a record of President Donald Trump's first phone conversation his Ukrainian counterpart on Friday, a call in which the two chat amicably and there's no mention of the Bidens or the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>The record of the April call was released at 9 a.m., just as day 2 of the House's public impeachment hearings stemming from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/read-full-transcript-trump-s-conversation-ukraine-s-president-n1058581">Trump's July call</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was set to begin.</p>
      <p>Trump tweeted earlier this week the April call was "the first, and therefore more important, phone call."</p>

      <p>Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, read the call record out loud in his opening statement at the hearing.</p>
      <p>The tone of the April 21 call between Trump and the Ukrainian then-president elect appeared warm and congratulatory, according to the call record.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to congratulate you on a job well done, and congratulations on a fantastic election," Trump said in the call from Air Force One, referring to Zelenskiy's landslide election win.</p>
      <p>"It's very nice to hear from you, and I appreciate the congratulations," Zelenskiy tells Trump, adding that Trump's own victory in 2016 was "a great example."</p>
      <p>Trump, who's been portrayed by House Republicans as carrying a grudge against the Ukrainian government stemming from the 2016 election, told Zelenskiy, "I think you will do a great job. I have many friends in Ukraine who know you and like you. I have many friends from Ukraine and they think — frankly — expected you to win. And it's really an amazing thing that you've done," Trump said.</p>
      <p>He also said that "when I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people. Ukraine was always very well represented."</p>
