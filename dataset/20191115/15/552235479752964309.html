      <p>A Dumbarton actress who performed in a sell-out Trainspotting tour has now been signed by a major talent agency as she bids for stardom.</p>
      <p>Lauren Downie brought a gritty slice of Scotland to the Big Apple when she starred in a theatre production of Irvine Welsh’s novel on Broadway.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old lived her American dream in the dazzling lights of New York where she performed a block away from Times Square.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, she has has now returned to the UK after eight years away after being signed by Keddie Scott Associates, which opens her up to acting jobs across theatre, film and television.</p>
      <p>She moved to London two weeks after returning and is now busy auditioning for her next role.</p>
      <p>Lauren, who went to Dumbarton Academy, said: “I have been in London for a few days now and I’m settling in. The agency are now setting me up with auditions and it’s really nice to have that support of an agent.</p>
      <p>“I’m really excited to be signed with Keddie Scott Associates as it was my aim to be represented by an agency and they were one of the agencies I really wanted to sign with.</p>
      <p>“They will be putting me up for all different kinds of acting jobs.”</p>
      <p>Lauren was headhunted by the agency after a representative visited one of their clients, who was performing alongside her in Trainspotting.</p>
      <p>The actress incredibly played eight different roles in the production, which had seven months of acclaimed reviews in New York before touring the UK earlier this year.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: “We had a really successful tour with the show. Everywhere we went was sold out. The crowds loved it.</p>
      <p>“Edinburgh Fringe was great and really busy. We did 14 shows a week and it was sold out for the whole month.</p>
      <p>“During those shows I got interest from an agent in London, who wanted to represent me so I thought it would make sense to move down here.”</p>
      <p>Lauren flew back to New York to say her goodbyes before returning back to the UK last month.</p>
      <p>She continued: “It was really emotional because I had lived there for eight years.</p>
      <p>“It was kind of where I grew up and learned about my adult self but it was the right time to leave and take an opportunity I couldn’t miss.</p>
      <p>“I came back on October 5 and stayed with my parents for a couple of weeks and then moved down to London</p>
      <p>“London is very different to New York but I’ve got a lot of friends here so it’s not as scary.”</p>
      <p>Lauren was inspired to begin a career in performance after becoming a member of Dumbarton People’s Theatre at the age of eight.</p>
      <p>Entertainment was always a huge part of growing up with mum Sheila, dad Gordon and sister Katie also involved in the group.</p>
      <p>She went on to gain a diploma in musical theatre at the Dance School of Scotland in Glasgow.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>From there, the talented performer graduated from the prestigious American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) in New York – the same school attended by pop star Jason Derulo.</p>
      <p>Lauren added: “It is a challenging industry. Being an actor, you don’t know where your next job is going to be or how long it’s going to be for.</p>
      <p>“But it’s really exciting and I love it.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about auditions she said: “It can be nerve wracking but I try and relax as much as I can and enjoy them. You just have to be as prepared as they keep you on your toes!”</p>
