      <p>Lawyers for a man scheduled to be executed next week have filed a new legal bid to halt his death sentence.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rodney-reed">Rodney Reed</a> was convicted of raping and strangling 19-year-old Stacy Stites in 1996 while she was on her way to work at a supermarket in Bastrop, around 30 miles southeast of  the Texan city of Austin.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old has long maintained that the teenager was killed by her fiance  Jimmy Fennell. </p>
      <p>He has claimed that former police officer was angry about the fact that they were having an affair and that he was black and she was white. </p>
      <p>His lawyers have now claimed in a new legal filing that seven new witnesses would help prove his innocence. They hope to void the execution writ which was signed in July.</p>
      <p>Protesters have staged rallies outside the Bastrop County district attorney’s office and heard from speakers including members of the inmate’s family.</p>
      <p>Reed's supporters held their biggest protest yet outside Texas governor <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/greg-abbott">Greg Abbott</a>'s mansion last week. </p>
      <p>Celebrities including <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Beyonce">Beyonce</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/KimKardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/OprahWinfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> have all called on the Republican to release Reed and around 3 million people have signed a petition to grant clemency to him. </p>
      <p>Kristina Roth, Amnesty International USA’s senior criminal justice programmes officer, said: “It is deeply disturbing that a consensual intimate relationship between Rodney Reed, a black man, and Stacey Stites, a white woman, was conflated with an act of violence. Killing a person creates a murderer out of the executioner, is not justice for Stacey Stites, and deprives Rodney Reed of dignity and humanity.”</p>
      <p>She added that the death penalty "is applied disproportionally against people of colour and Rodney Reed’s case is a glaring example."  </p>
      <p>Reed’s lawyers have presented affidavits supporting his claims. One from a former prison inmate claims Mr Fennell bragged about killing Stites and referred to Reed by a racial slur.</p>

      <p>His lawyers say other recent affidavits also corroborate the relationship between Stites and Reed.</p>
      <p>Mr Fennell’s attorney has said his client did not kill Stites and prosecutors maintain they believe Reed is guilty.</p>
      <p>Texas remains the death penalty capital of the US even as executions nationwide hover at historic lows.</p>
      <p>Last year, about half of the 25 executions nationwide took place in Texas, which has put eight people to death this year.</p>
