      <h1>Jawa Perak launched at Rs 1.95 lakh</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:59:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:59</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>The Jawa Perak bobber has been finally showcased in production-ready form; bookings open in January 2020 with deliveries expected in April.</p>
      <p>Jawa has just launched its third and last of the three models it showcased last year - Perak - at Rs 1.95 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/jawa-perak-priced-at-rs-189-lakh-410459">The Perak was first showcased with a Rs 1.89 lakh price tag</a> </b>and the near Rs 6,000 increase is likely a result of the engine being upgraded to meet the new BS6 emission norms.</p>
      <p>Jawa will begin to accept bookings for the Perak on January 1, 2020. However, the bike maker has revealed that deliveries for the motorcycle will begin much later, on April 2, 2020. This is quite a significant waiting period – just like we saw with the last two Jawa models.</p>
      <p>The Perak looks very different from its siblings. It's got a low and long stance, and its bobber styling cues look impressive. The bike also gives up all the chrome for a matte-black treatment. The Perak is a single-seater and features a different toolbox design. The bobber-like styling elements include a floating seat, bar-end mirrors, chopped fenders, and stubby exhaust mufflers.</p>
      <p>The Jawa Perak bobber is powered by a BS6-compliant 334cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled, DOHC engine which develops 30hp and 31Nm of torque. At this capacity, the Perak's engine is slightly larger than that of the Jawa and the Forty Two. This increased capacity is a result of a larger bore, with the stroke remaining unchanged. In comparison, the Jawa and Jawa Forty Two make 27hp and 28Nm of torque. The Perak also has a different subframe-and-suspension setup at the rear. The bike employs a monoshock and features a disc brake at either end with dual-channel ABS as standard.</p>
