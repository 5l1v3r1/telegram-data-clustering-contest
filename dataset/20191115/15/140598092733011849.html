      <h1>US judge says London woman has 'got away with murder' after one year prison sentence for fatal bottom lift</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:27:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/patrick-sawer/" target="_blank">Patrick Sawer</a></address>
      <p>A British woman extradited to New York has been told by a judge she has “got away with murder” after being sentenced to a year in prison for performing a botched bottom lift which killed a young woman. </p>
      <p>Donna Francis, from Loughton, Essex, burst into tears when the Queens District Supreme Court Judge Kenneth Holder handed down the sentence on Thursday, a month after she pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide in the death of Kelly Mayhew. </p>
      <p>Ms Mayhew, 34, a television producer from Maryland, died from 'systemic silicone emboli' after silicone entered her bloodstream in May 2015, while undergoing the procedure in the basement of Francis’s Queen’s home.</p>
      <p>Francis was initially indicted in 2016 for the death of Ms Mayhew, who had paid $1,600  (£1,240) for the procedure. </p>
      <p>A day after Mayhew's death, Francis fled to London, where she lived until she was extradited in August, back to the US.</p>
      <p>However under the terms of her extradition agreed with a British judge by US prosecutors she could not be sentenced to longer than a year in prison, something both Judge Holder and Ms Mayhew’s family described as an “injustice”. </p>
      <p>With time served Francis could be free by mid-April. </p>
      <p>Sentencing the 39-year-old, Judge Holder said: “I have to say that the phrase ‘getting away with murder’ certainly applies to you. What [the family] is not getting, in my opinion, is justice.”</p>
      <p>He added: “If you have a conscience, this is going to haunt you much longer than the 1-year sentence you’re going to serve.”</p>

      <p>Ms Mayhew's mother, Latrice, told the New York Post: “If you can sleep on the fact that you just killed someone…then you don’t care. She got away with murder.” </p>
      <p>During the sentencing, Ms Mayhew’s brother, Richard Lane, read a statement on behalf of their mother, which said that Francis would not tell her the address to give responders when she called 911, and instead packed up her equipment and fled the scene.</p>
      <p>“Kelly was clearly in need of emergency services and she said, ‘No, she’s going to be okay’,” Lane told the court. “Kelly’s last words to my mother were, "Mommy, hold my hand’.”</p>
      <p>The extradition order also requires that Francis serve her sentence in Suffolk County, Long Island, rather than the notorious Rikers Island detention facility.</p>
      <p>Acting Queens District Attorney John Ryan said Francis, a former hairdresser with no medical training, injected Mayhew's buttocks with silicone gel purchased from eBay in the basement of her home in the Far Rockaway neighborhood on May 30, 2015.</p>
      <p>The authorities say the silicone entered Mayhew's bloodstream and killed her. </p>
      <p>Mr Ryan said Ms Mayhew “went into cardiac arrest” as Francis “pumped a clear liquid substance into the woman’s backside”. </p>
      <p>According to authorities, Mayhew, who had undergone five previous plastic surgeries, began showing signs of distress after she was administered a second injection.</p>
      <p>Her mother, who was with her at the time, dialed 911 and emergency responders found Mayhew lying unresponsive face up at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
      <p>She was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>Francis fought extradition to the US, but a British judge ruled in October that the severity of the crime necessitated that the mother-of-one be sent to New York for trial. </p>
      <p>Her young daughter will be cared for by her maternal grandmother while she serves her sentence.</p>
      <p>Appearing in court dressed in a black suit and gold-tipped stilettos, she sobbed as she told Judge Holder she regretted what happened.</p>
      <p>“I’m sorry for everything. It wasn’t my intention to hurt anyone. I’m sorry for all the years this has been going on. I’m just sorry,” she said.</p>
