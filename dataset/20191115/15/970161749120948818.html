      <p>A primary school has caused uproar after announcing only one parent per child can attend this year’s Christmas carol concert.</p>
      <p>Lady Boswell’s CE Primary <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a>, in Sevenoaks, Kent, said there was inadequate space at nearby St Nicholas Church to seat all parents of the 256 participating pupils.</p>
      <p>Parents and guardians were furious and said it was forcing seven to 11-year-olds to choose their ‘favourite parent’.</p>
      <p>One disgruntled dad said the demand was ‘disgraceful’, especially in the Christmas season’.</p>
      <p>Not only does it make families need to chose a single parent to go, he said it also bans any other children.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘Considering this is the last carol service to be attended by the now full Year 6 children, this is disgraceful.’</p>

      <p>The school’s headteacher Sharon Saunders said the festive wrangle has forced a re-think.</p>
      <p>School staff are now trying to come up with other ways to accommodate children, their parents and up to 60 staff at the church.</p>
      <p>Mrs Saunders added: ‘We have to comply with health and safety and getting that number of children into the church and out into the car park is difficult, but we want to sort it out safely.’</p>
      <p>She said she didn’t want the two form entry reception to Year 6 school did not want to split the service over two days.</p>
      <p>The headteacher added: ‘We are a family and we want to come together as a family with all the children to celebrate together.</p>
      <p>‘The important thing is the children but we do not want to exclude anybody and are trying to work something out.’</p>
