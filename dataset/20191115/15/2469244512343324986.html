      <h1>Calls made to increase University of Exeter student safety after serious sexual assault</h1>
      <h2>The student petition went online yesterday and has already gained nearly 4000 signatures</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:54:03+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Vowles</a></address>
      <p>A student at the University of Exeter has created a petition calling on the university to introduce greater safety measures to help protect students around the city.</p>
      <p>The petition follows <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/police-confirm-serious-sexual-assault-3538718">a serious sexual assault which took place in the early hours of Wednesday November 13, </a> in the St Germans Road area, near the university.</p>
      <p>University student, Izzy Smith, started the Change.org petition-named, Increase Safety for students at University of Exeter.</p>
      <p>The petition asks the university to introduce a night time shuttle bus to student accommodation and for a more visible presence of the university's Estate Patrol security team. The petition went online yesterday, and has already received nearly 4000 signatures, as well as comments suggesting the university should increase lighting around campus.</p>
      <p>The full student petition reads: "After the recent serious sexual assault on St Germans Road and other assaults/attacks in Exeter, many students feel like their safety is in danger after nights out.</p>
      <p>"We are asking the University of Exeter to help protect its students by introducing a night time shuttle bus to halls and popular student living areas. We are also asking for a more visible presence of Estate Patrol during the night time, around halls, and on the typical routes students use to get home from clubs.</p>
      <p>"We don't feel like a couple of emails with nothing more than the Estate Patrol's phone number is enough of an effort to protect our safety. The safety of the students is invaluable and for £9,250 a year a shuttle bus to prevent further horrific assaults is a small request.</p>
      <p>"If you have ever felt unsafe, unsettled, or scared walking home at night, please sign this petition to try and get the University of Exeter to take serious and necessary action to protect you and your fellow students.</p>
      <p>"In the meantime please remember to never walk home on your own, use trusted taxi services (look for a yellow or green license plate),  call 999 if you feel that your safety is in danger."</p>

      <p>A University of Exeter spokesperson said: "The safety and welfare of all students and staff is our highest priority at all times. The University has a significant number of schemes and initiatives in place, including operating a 24-hour, year-round Estate Patrol service to assist with safety and security of students in the city as well as on campus.</p>
      <p>"The University also works in close partnership with the police and a dedicated PCSO to enhance student safety, and we operate a scheme in conjunction with Apple Taxis which allows students to get taxis to campus after dark, if stranded, and pay at a later date.</p>
      <p>"While incidents of this nature are extremely rare, we understand that students will be distressed and concerned and will consider the suggestions put forward in this petition, as we continue to work to support the safety and security of all members of our community."</p>
      <p>Following the attack, officers have been carrying out community reassurance work in the area and have appealed for witnesses to come forward.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Dawn Perriam said: "This is a rare and isolated incident. I would like to reassure the public that police are pursuing all lines of enquiry."</p>
      <p>Detectives would like to identify a suspect who is described as a white male, aged in his mid to late 20s, tall and slim, toned but not muscly build, with short, dark hair and facial stubble.</p>
      <p>He spoke broken English, had an eastern-European accent and was wearing dark, navy blue jeans with a belt and a dark top which was believed to be grey or black.</p>
      <p>Anyone with any information is urged to call police on 101, or email 101@dcpolice.uk, quoting log number 205 of 14/11/19.</p>
      <p>Members of the public with any concerns are also encouraged to contact police using the above details.</p>
      <p>Information can also be passed anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555111, or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org</p>
