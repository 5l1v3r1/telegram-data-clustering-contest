        <b>Alexander Albon brought a wet first practice session at the Brazilian Grand Prix to a premature end with a crash on slick tyres on a damp track.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Anglo-Thai, who this week was confirmed as a Red Bull driver for 2020, lost control at the last corner, Juncao, and broke the front suspension and wing.</p>
      <p>Albon also ended the session fastest after running when the track was driest on intermediate tyres a few minutes earlier.</p>
      <p>His team-mate Max Verstappen and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc also had offs in the treacherous conditions.</p>

      <p>They both lost control at Turn Two but neither caused any damage.</p>
      <p>Verstappen spun, at almost the same time as Albon went off, and was able to continue without hitting anything. Leclerc merely had a wobble.</p>
      <p>And Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat also spun, this time at Turn One, as he also tried the untreated dry-weather tyres.</p>
      <p>The list of times were unrepresentative because of the changing conditions, but Albon was quickest by 0.551 seconds from Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas and Ferrari drivers Sebastian Vettel and Leclerc.</p>
      <p>The track started very wet at the beginning of the session after heavy rain, but the rain stopped shortly after the end of the session.</p>
      <p>The track progressively dried but the incidents at the end proved it was not quite enough for slick tyres.</p>
