      <p><i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> developer Game Freak <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2019/10/9/20906246/galarian-ponya-pokemon-shield-exclusive-nintendo-switch">set up a 24-hour stream in October just to reveal Ponyta’s Galarian form</a>, a pastel unicorn-esque creature which a cotton candy mane.</p>
      <p>It’s become one of the most anticipated Pokémon ahead of <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>’s Nov. 15 launch date. Galarian Ponyta is a <i>Shield</i> exclusive, so you’ll only be able to catch one if you’ve got that version — otherwise, you’ll have to trade to get one in your game. (Sirfetch’d is the <i>Sword</i> exclusive.)</p>
      <p>If you’re a <i>Shield</i> player and looking to catch a Galarian Ponyta, you’ll find it hiding within the tall grass in Glimwood Tangle, which is just south of Ballonlea.</p>

      <p>Glimwood Tangle is one area in <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> where Pokémon don’t spawn in the overworld — meaning, they’ll hide within the tall grass. That makes it tricky to find Ponyta, but it’s in there, so keep looking. The general consensus seems to be that Ponyta will appear about 1 in 10 times within Glimwood Tangle’s tall grass. You’ll want to walk slowly through the area or else it could scare the Ponyta away.</p>
      <p>The only way to get Ponyta’s Galarian evolution, Rapidash, is to evolve it — you won’t find it in the wild. Ponyta will evolve into Rapidash at level 38. Here’s what it looks like:</p>
