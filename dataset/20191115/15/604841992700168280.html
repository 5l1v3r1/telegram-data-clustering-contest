      <p>Renowned two-time Grammy nominee Iarla Ó Lionáird is best known for his unmistakable voice and distinctive sean nós style as part of the stunningly successful group The Gloaming. Now the singer, described as having "one of the most dramatic voices in contemporary music", joins up with his fellow The Gloaming band member Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh for a special, once off concert with Trad/Jazz/Contemporary folk group This is How we Fly at Solstice Arts Centre in Navan.</p>
      <p>Formed in 2010, This is How we Fly consists of Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh on hardanger d'amore, Seán Mac Erlaine on clarinets &amp; electronics, Nic Gareiss on percussive dance, and Petter Berndalen on drums and percussion. The blend of these four individual musicians draws on Irish, Swedish and American music and dance traditions, merging jazz and traditional Irish music seamlessly into a mesmerising, brand new but instantly recognisable sound. Their collective catalogue includes collaborations with The Gloaming, The Chieftains, Darol Anger and Gjallarhorn. </p>

      <p>Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh is a sublime Irish fiddler who’s not afraid to step outside convention. Nic Gareiss is a sophisticated Appalachian hard shoe dancer stepping into the rhythmic foreground. Seán Mac Erlaine is a thoughtful Dublin jazzman who has moved beyond the linear constraints of the genre. Petter Berndalen is a lyrical Swedish percussionist redefining the melodic and sonic place of drums within the contours of traditional song.</p>
      <p>Iarla Ó Lionáird has carved a long and unique career in music both internationally and in Ireland. From his iconic early recording of the vision song “Aisling Gheal” as a young boy to his ground breaking recordings with Dublin's Crash Ensemble and New York’s Alarm Will Sound, he has shown a breadth of artistic ambition that sets him apart in the Irish Music fraternity. The truth is, it’s the individual sonic qualities of his voice that define him. That voice, with all its midnight depth and soaring breadth, transcends anything that might box or classify him as one thing or another. His unique singing style has carried him to stages and concert halls all over the world, from New York's Carnegie Hall to the Sydney Opera House and beyond.</p>
      <p>Also an accomplished broadcaster, Ó Lionáird’s recent radio series “Vocal Chords” on the mysteries of the human voice, for Ireland’s National Classical Music Broadcaster, RTE Lyric FM, won both Gold and Silver Awards at the “New York Radio Festival” 2017. His voice has graced the silver screen also, with film credits extending from "The Gangs of New York" to "Hotel Rwanda" and most recently as featured singer in the film “Brooklyn” starring Saoirse Ronan. </p>
