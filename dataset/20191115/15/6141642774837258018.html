      <p>Lewis Hamilton will seek reassurances over Toto Wolff’s plans before committing his future to Mercedes.</p>
      <p>Wolff, who has overseen five of Hamilton’s six world championship triumphs, has been touted as a leading candidate to run the sport beyond next season.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old Austrian insists his focus remains on Mercedes, but after leading the Silver Arrows to win historic sixth consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ titles, he could be tempted by taking on a fresh challenge.</p>

      <p>“I am waiting to see where Toto’s head is at,” said Hamilton ahead of Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>“He has been the perfect match for this team, so I don’t want him to leave if I am going to stay in this sport.</p>
      <p>“I know that as a figurehead of a business, you have got to have the right people in place.</p>
      <p>“If you look at some organisations, a new person can come in and they will start doing things their own way, and it can go wrong. So, what he does is important for me.</p>

      <p>“I know that being stuck in a position for too long is not always a positive.</p>
      <p>“I want people to constantly spread their wings and do what is best. The sport could also be in a good place with someone like him running it.”</p>
      <p>Team principal Wolff is absent from this weekend’s race after Hamilton secured his sixth world championship in Austin a fortnight ago. It marks the first grand prix Wolff has missed since he joined the all-conquering Silver Arrows in 2013.</p>
      <p>Wolff has formed a strong relationship with Hamilton, allowing the Briton time to focus on extra-curricular activities away from the track as well as making him the sport’s best-paid driver.</p>

      <p>But the 34-year-old, perhaps sensing the Italian giants are manoeuvring the impressive Charles Leclerc to be their long-term number one, has recently played down a switch to Ferrari, instead speaking of continuing his legacy with Mercedes.</p>
      <p>“I love what I am doing and I see no reason to stop anytime soon,” added Hamilton.</p>
      <p>“I have only just completed this contract, and I have to start talking about the next one, which is frustrating because it is another stressful moment where you have to get into the ring and have a friendly, yet intense conversation.</p>

      <p>“It’s daunting when you think of it coming up because you’re committing to a period of time in your life. Sometimes it’s hard to imagine that far ahead.”</p>
      <p>Hamilton will wear a special crash helmet here at Interlagos to honour Ayrton Senna, his childhood hero who perished at the San Marino Grand Prix 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>“As a kid, I saw Ayrton on TV doing something great just as I saw Superman,” said Hamilton. “He was my favourite superhero.</p>
      <p>“I saw Ayrton standing up for himself, and, as a young boy growing up in Stevenage who was constantly confronted with bullying, it was great to see someone standing up for themselves, seeing his beliefs and his never-say-die attitude.”</p>
