      <h1>An interview with Andy Greenberg about his book Sandworm, on the Russian state hackers who attack power grids</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:32:48+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>Wired security reporter Andy Greenberg's latest book is <a href="https://amzn.to/2wfouLS">Sandworm</a> (<a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/11/01/cybersecurity-is-interested-in.html">previously</a>), a true-life technothriller that tells the stories of the cybersecurity experts who analyzed and attributed as series of ghastly cyberwar attacks that brought down parts of the Ukrainian power grid, and then escaped the attackers' control and spread all over the world.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://narrativespecies.wordpress.com/2019/11/14/andy-greenberg-sandworm/">interview with Rick Kleffel's Agony Column podcast</a> (<a href="http://www.bookotron.com/agony/audio/2019/2019-interviews/andy_greenberg-2019.mp3">MP3</a>) Greenberg tells the tale of how he came to write this extraordinary book, and what it means in the context of Ukraine and the current US political situation.</p>
