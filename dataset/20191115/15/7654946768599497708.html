      <p>A surfer dude from Hawaii shocked his girlfriend in the most surf bum way — by accidentally dropping the engagement ring in the surf.</p>
      <p>Christopher Garth, 38, had gone out surfing with his sweetheart Lauren Oiye, 32, in their native Honolulu with the ring in his pocket, <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2019/11/12/he-proposed-while-surfing-then-lost-ring-luckily-he-was-prepared/">Hawaii News Now reported</a>.</p>
      <p>While riding a wave, Garth knelt down on one knee with Oiye surfing next to him — and popped the question. Just as the ring slipped from his fingers, his love said, “Yes!”</p>
      <p>“I turn back to make sure he was on the wave with me and he was on one knee with a ring box and screamed out ‘Lauren, I love you! Will you marry me?!'” Oiye, a therapist and yoga instructor, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4tEXSJDh9Q/">wrote of the engagement</a> on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“At first I thought it was a joke and then realized it clearly wasn’t.”</p>
      <p>Relax: Garth, executive director of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-garth-9b690572">Hawai’i Dispensary Alliance</a>, might be a beach bum — but he is no dummy. The ring was a decoy.</p>
      <p>Anticipating some choppy white caps, Garth had the<i> real</i> rock waiting for his gal on the shore of Queen’s Beach in Waikiki.</p>

      <p>Turns out the pair actually<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4vGPzAjN4w/"> bonded over a shared love</a> of the ocean.</p>
      <p>“We caught a wave together at the surf break we met at and had many of our first dates,” Oiye wrote on Insta. “Christopher Garth, I love you and am so grateful the stars aligned and our ancestors that came before us so beautifully orchestrated this for us!”</p>
