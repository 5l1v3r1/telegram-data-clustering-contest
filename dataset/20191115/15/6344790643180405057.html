      <h1>Jon Favreau Says the Ideas Are Ready for a New STAR WARS Holiday Special</h1>

      <p>A couple of months ago, <b><i>The Mandalorian</i></b> creator<b> Jon Favreau</b> said that he would love to make a new <b><i>Star Wars</i></b><b><i>Holiday Special</i></b>. Apparently he’s been thinking about this a lot because he already has an actor in mind that he wants to appear in the series, and he also says he has ideas that are ready to go. He’s actually really excited about this! I guess if anyone could make another <i>Star Wars Holiday Special</i>, Favreau would be the perfect guy to do it!</p>
      <p>If you watched <i>The Mandalorian</i>, then I’m sure you caught the reference to Life Day by comedian <b>Horatio Sanz</b>, who played the all-blue Mythrol character that The Mandalorian captured at the beginning of the episode. The character was hoping he could return to his family for the celebration. For those of you who don’t know, Life Day was first introduced in the original <i>Star Wars Holiday Special</i>.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/jon-favreau-star-wars-life-day-1203405427/">Variety</a>, Favreau was asked about the possibility of a <i>Star Wars Holiday Special</i>, and he said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Oh I would definitely be interested in doing a holiday special. And I’m not going to say who I would be interested in. But one of the people is the member of the cast in an upcoming episode of the show. So we’ll leave it at that for now.”</blockquote>
      <p>When pressed to see if he was actually really serious about this, the director said:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve been thinking about it. It’s ready, the ideas are ready. I think it could be really fun. Not as part of this, but there’s an excitement around it because it was so fun and weird, and off and not connected to what ‘Star Wars’ was in the theater. ‘The Mandalorian’ cartoon, the Boba Fett cartoon, from the holiday special was definitely a point of inspiration for what we did in the show.”</blockquote>
      <p>Well, maybe in the years to come during the holidays, Favreau’s dream will come true and we’ll get to enjoy watching whatever he’s got planned for his <i>Star Wars Holiday Special</i>. That would be the greatest gift ever!</p>
