      <p>Specialising in boozy hot drinks - including hot chocolate spiked with tequila and a hot toddy guaranteed to put hairs on your chest - it's easy to see why Nottingham's new Nordic-themed bar is described as "<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> in a cup".</p>
      <p>Thor's Tipi, a cosy festive pop-up where visitors can drink beer out of Viking horns while warming up around a roaring firepit, has officially pitched-up in the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-centre">city centre</a>'s Trinity Square for the Yuletide season.</p>
      <p>Open seven days a week, from 10am to 11pm, the supersized teepee has room for 160 guests with space for up to 12 people to sit around the real fire.</p>
      <p>One of just six in the country, plans to add Nottingham to its list of locations have been in the pipeline for more than year.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to come last year but in the end it just didn't work out," says managing director and co-founder Maria Farrugia.</p>

      <p>"But we are so happy to be in Nottingham now and really want to complement local businesses - we want people to come to us and then stay to explore what's on offer in the local area," she adds.</p>
      <p>Free to enter, advance bookings can be made to guarantee a seat but it's first-come-first-served when it comes to bagging a place around the fire.</p>
      <p>Behind the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/pubs-and-bars-in-nottingham">bar</a> a huge menu is offered, with unusual winter warmers likely to be its best sellers.</p>
      <p>Hot cocktails include hot mulled wine with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and spices (£4.30), Winter Cherry (hot mulled wine with vodka, cherries, white cranberry and sweet plum, £5.70), Spice Orange (hot mulled wine with Valencian oranges and Venezuelan rum, £6.60) Fiery Ginger (hot mulled wine with King's Ginger liqueur and lemon oils, £6.60), hot mulled cider with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and spices and the epic Thor's Hot Toddy (honey vodka, Rhum Orange and hot cider, £7.20).</p>
      <p>As well as this, there is also mead (£6.70 for a 125ml glass), cocktails (£6.20 - £7), gin and classic twists on favourite including Caramel Cola (salted caramel vodka and coke, £6.10), Smokey Orange (Jack Daniels and spiced orange ginger ale, £6.10), and Spiced Ting (spiced rum and Caribbean grapefruit soda, £6.10).</p>
      <p>Most Insta-worthy perhaps is the option to drink your beer, real ale and cider (from £2.30 a half-pint) out of a Viking horn.</p>
      <p>Punters need to put down a £6 deposit for the quirky drinking vessel and can either chose to return it and get a refund or take it home to keep.</p>

      <p>Normal and boozy hot chocolates are also available on the Cocoa House menu. A standard drink made from Thor's own special blend imported from Germany is £2,75, a Baileys version with cream is £4.30, Spicy Aztec Cocoa (silver tequila, criollo chocolate and arbol chilli peppers), is £5.30.</p>
      <p>As well as wetting your whistle there's plenty to get the old taste buds going too with a rotating trio of food vendors serving up street food from the outside cabin. The Big Melt will be rustling up yummy grilled cheeses, Son of Steak will be serving chicken, beef and vegan burgers, while Power to the Poutine will be offering a menu dedicated to Canada's national dish.  </p>
      <p>In the pipeline too is a Sunday Club complete with free papers, a mini hot choc for the kids and craft activities and stalls from local businesses Handmade Nottingham and Beads.</p>
      <p>Maria says: "This is our fifth year doing this having started off in York and what we've realised is our demographic is everyone - from families, to couples on dates to grandmas and grandads.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is welcome to come sit down by the fire, take the weight off their feet and enjoy the warm atmosphere."</p>
