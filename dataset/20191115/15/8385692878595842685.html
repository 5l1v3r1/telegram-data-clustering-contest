      <p>Best Buy has the JLab Audio Epic Air Sport <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> today for just $119. Taking a cool $30 off of its regular price. That's a really good price for a pair of truly wireless headphones. And definitely a deal that you won't want to miss out on.</p>
      <p>This is part of Best Buy's latest pre-Black Friday sale.</p>
      <p>The Epic Air Sport are a great pair of truly wireless headphones. In fact, I have a pair that I use pretty consistently. These are great when it comes to battery life and also sound quality.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>When talking about battery life, we're looking at over 10 hours on a single charge. Now the reason these are able to give you such great battery life, compared to other truly wireless headphones, is because they are ear hook headphones. So they hook over your ears, giving it more space to put in more battery. Unlike the other earbuds out there that just sit in your ear. The included carrying case will also give you about 60 hours of charge time â€“ charging them about six times, fully.</p>
      <p>Sound quality isn't bad here, but it's not the best either. You will still get some pretty good sound out of these headphones, just don't compare them to the Sony WF-1000XM3 headphones. The bass is pretty decent with some crisp mids and highs. The EQ is also customizable on these.</p>
      <p>Finally, these sport Bluetooth 5. This is going to allow for multiple connections, but more importantly better battery life on your smartphone. Allowing you to listen longer without it really impacting your smartphone's battery. And that's definitely a good thing these days.</p>
