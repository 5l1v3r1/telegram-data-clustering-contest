      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Notre_Dame/?tps=1">Notre Dame</a> expects its 273-game sellout streak at Notre Dame Stadium to end when the Fighting Irish host Navy on Saturday just outside of South Bend, Ind.</p>
      <p>The streak dates back to the last game of the 1973 season. Notre Dame Stadium held 59,075 fans that season, but now has a capacity of 77,622.</p>
      <p>"Based on ticket sales through Wednesday, we do not anticipate sellouts for our games against Navy and Boston College," Notre Dame athletic director <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jack_Swarbrick/?tps=1">Jack Swarbrick</a> said <a href="https://twitter.com/NDFootballPR/status/1194958142502834177">in a statement Thursday</a>.</p>
      <p>"That this comes during a time of sustained success for our football program reflects both challenges impacting the ticket market nationwide and the unique dynamics of this year's schedule."</p>
      <p>The Fighting Irish (7-2) have played in front of sellout crowds in 321 of 322 home games since 1964.</p>
      <p>Notre Dame hosts Navy at 2:30 p.m. EST Saturday. The Fighting Irish host Boston College at 2:30 p.m. Nov. 23 in the final home game of 2019 before ending the season at Stanford.</p>
