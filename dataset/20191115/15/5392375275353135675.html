      <p>Galaxy S10 family is receiving the fourth Android 10-based One UI 2 beta<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung’s</a> development team is busy in this late part of 2019. After all, the company is doing the best to ensure that its current flagship will be running the latest version of Android until 2020. The Galaxy S10 and Note 10 family are currently running betas of the company’s One UI 2.0. The new version of Samsung’s proprietary skin is based on Android 10 and brings several improvements and UI tweaks. Today the company is rolling the fourth beta of One UI 2.0 for the Galaxy S10 series.</p>
      <p>The first reports about the update are<a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-android-10-beta-update-released-for-the-galaxy-s10-download-now/"> popping out from Germany</a>. This particular version of the firmware bears  G97**XXU3ZSK9 build number and weighs in at just over 344 MB. Just like the previous betas, this one comes to fix issues rather than to introduce new features. According to the changelog, Samsung addresses tackle screen flickering problems, status bar issues, keyboard, and other UI problems.</p>

      <p>Interestingly enough, Samsung already closed the beta program for the Galaxy S10 in South-Korea. It’s a good signal since it indicates that the company might be close to the end of the beta phase and a stable release is imminent. Unless those new critical bugs are found in this fourth beta, we have reasons to believe that it will one if not the last beta release for the Galaxy S10.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Note 10 beta program started after the S10, but we also believe that it should receive the final Android 10 update before the end of the year.</p>
