      <h1>LSU at Ole Miss: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:48:49+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Last weekend, the LSU Tigers made a huge statement by defeating the Alabama Crimson Tide on the road. The victory in Tuscaloosa resulted in them earning the <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/the-college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-11-have-been-released">No. 1 spot in the College Football Playoff rankings</a>.</p>
      <p>Joe Burrow has been dominant this season, completing 78.9 percent of his passes for 3,198 yards and 33 touchdowns. His performance against Alabama may have sealed the deal for him winning the Heisman Trophy.</p>
      <p>Even though LSU has a much easier opponent on the schedule for this weekend, there has to be some concern about a potential “trap game.”</p>
      <p>Ole Miss has struggled mightily this season, but the offense has the firepower to put up points at home this weekend. The Rebels average 434.5 total yards per game on offense.</p>
      <p>As you’d expect, the Tigers are heavy favorites to win this weekend.</p>

      <p>Here are the details for the LSU-Ole Miss game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>7:00 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel: </b>ESPN</p>
      <p><b>Spread: </b>LSU -21.5</p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>65.5</p>
      <p><b>Announcers: </b>Sean McDonough, Todd Blackledge, Holly Rowe</p>
      <p>At this point, the Tigers are on track to make the SEC Championship. However, they must avoid an upset loss this weekend in a hostile environment.</p>
      <p>Per ESPN’s <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401110850">Football Power Index,</a> LSU has a 90.7 percent chance of defeating Ole Miss.</p>
      <p>Do you think LSU will remain undefeated after this weekend?</p>
