      <h1>British Gas apologises for sending a woman letter calling her 'Ms Nightmare'</h1>
      <h2>The letter was sent to a great grandmother after she asked why she wasn't able to access her account online, however British Gas is saying it's a genuine mistake</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:49:32+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>British Gas has apologised for sending an 79-year-old  woman in which they called her 'Ms Nightmare'.</p>
      <p>Luckily for them, great-grandmother Janet Nightingale saw the funny side.</p>
      <p>After Janet moved into a flat in Overstrand Road, Cromer, Norfolk, she wrote to the company explaining she was unable to access her online account.</p>
      <p>She got a reply from the complaints department at British Gas reading in bold letters: "We're sorry you've had cause to complain" and then in smaller text "Dear Ms Nightmare".</p>
      <p>The grandmother-of-six and great-grandmother-of-one said: "My initial thought was 'bloody cheek'.</p>
      <p>"But then I thought 'What the hell. What's the point of complaining?'</p>
      <p>"A neighbour had helped me write the letter and he thought it was quite funny too.</p>
      <p>"It has given many of my friends some amusement."</p>

      <p>The neighbour, Stephen Scott-Fawcett, was equally amused by the response.</p>
      <p>He said "Janet moved into a flat below me in Cromer and asked for help to complain to British Gas about their service.</p>
      <p>"She received a standard complaints reply addressed to, wait for it, Ms Nightmare.</p>
      <p>"You couldn't make it up."</p>
      <p>Further on in the response, British Gas said they had been able to resolve her complaint.</p>
      <p>She is now set up as the new tenant for the property and can select a tariff and payment method, it added.</p>

      <p>A British Gas spokesman said: "Unfortunately our complaint handler made a typo in the spelling of Ms Nightingale's name, which he promptly corrected.</p>
      <p>"We've been in touch to apologise for the genuine mistake."</p>
      <p>Janet said she's proud of her surname and her second Christian name...Florence.</p>
