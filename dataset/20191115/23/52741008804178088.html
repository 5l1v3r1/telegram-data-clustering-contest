      <p>CLAYTON, Mo. — In an Oct. 18 story about an executed man’s daughter’s efforts to exonerate him in a 1985 killing in Tennessee, The Associated Press erroneously reported that she is seeking DNA testing on a Missouri man charged in a separate killing. She is seeking DNA testing on a pair of men’s underwear that was found at the Tennessee crime scene, and she and her lawyer have suggested that the Missouri man could be a suspect in that killing. The AP also misidentified her as April Sedley. Her name is April Alley.</p>
      <p>A corrected version of the story is below:</p>
      <p>Daughter of executed man seeks new DNA evidence testing</p>
      <p>Thirteen years after Sedley Alley was executed for a 1985 murder in Tennessee, his daughter is seeking DNA evidence testing in an effort to exonerate her father, and she suggests that a Missouri man charged in a 2018 killing could be a suspect</p>
      <p>Thirteen years after Sedley Alley was executed for a 1985 killing in Tennessee, his daughter is seeking DNA evidence testing in an effort to exonerate her father suggests that a Missouri man charged in a 2018 killing could be a suspect.</p>
      <p>Innocence Project co-founder Barry Scheck represents Alley’s daughter, April Alley.</p>
      <p>Scheck told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Missouri authorities say Thomas Bruce took an avionics course in Millington, Tennessee, around the time that Suzanne Collins, a 19-year-old Marine, was killed in Millington. Bruce matches a vague suspect description distributed by police.</p>
      <p>Bruce is jailed in St. Louis County, accused of sexually assaulting two women and killing a third in a Catholic Supply store last November.</p>
      <p>Scheck argued in October that she should be allowed to petition for new DNA testing of a pair of men’s underwear recovered at the Tennessee scene on behalf of her father's estate.</p>
      <p>Bruce’s attorney declined comment.</p>
