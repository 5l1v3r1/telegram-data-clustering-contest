      <p>A 40-year-old businessman, his wife and two children, have been missing from his residence at Mehsana for the past one week. Police lodged a missing persons complaint on November 14, after being approached by the businessman’s father.</p>
      <p>According to police, Prakash Panchal (40), his wife Dimple Panchal (38), their 16-year-old son Jay Panchal and 12-year-old daughter Mahi Panchal, residents of Sapan Exotica in Mehsana, went missing on the evening of November 7.</p>
      <p>Prakash owns a furniture showroom on the Radhanpur road under Mehsana taluka of the district. Prima facie, police said that the family had allegedly decided to leave their house after the businessman went bankrupt. Dimple and the two children were last seen leaving their residence around 4.30 pm on November 7.</p>
      <p>Prakash’s father, Dashrath Panchal received a call around 10.30 pm on November 7, where Prakash informed him that he has left Mehsana with his family and there was no need to follow them, police said. Prakash and Dimple’s phones were found switched off since the morning of November 8, police added.</p>
      <p>“Prakash’s father decided to wait for a week, hoping that the family might return on their own,” said an officer at Mehsana taluka police station. “We have started tracking CCTV footage. The family did not leave any letter behind.”</p>
