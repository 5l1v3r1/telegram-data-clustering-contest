      <p>The Oasis legend was full of his usual swagger as he played The Hydro in Glasgow tonight.</p>

      <p>And he told the raucous crowd: “It’s good to be back in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“It reminds me when I get famous I need to buy a little gaff up here. Oh no I’ll buy a big one instead.”</p>
      <p>He also <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4958432/liam-gallagher-apologies-scotland-concert/">repeated his apology</a> on behalf of his arch-rival brother Noel <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4472041/lewis-capaldi-noel-gallagher-oasis-chewbacca-scotland/">for his nasty comments about Scotland</a>.</p>
      <p>He said: “I want to take this opportunity to apologise for my little brother for what he said about your county.</p>
      <p>“Scotland’s the f***ing bollocks and so are the people.</p>
      <p>“You’ve always been very kind to us since we started out with Oasis so f*** knows what he’s on about”.</p>
      <p>And he certainly seemed to enjoy himself as he lapped up the adulation of the Scots crowd.</p>
      <p>The punters always want to hear some of the Oasis classics and he kicked things off with Rock ‘n’ Roll Star which was the perfect way to set the mood and get the party started.</p>
      <p>But Liam has really made a name for himself with his two solo albums and his fans would have been eagerly anticipating hearing some of them live.</p>
      <p>Halo was followed by the brilliantly up-tempo Shockwave and Wall of Glass.</p>
      <h3>Set List</h3>
      <p>Rock N Roll Star</p>
      <p>Halo</p>
      <p>Shockwave</p>
      <p>Wall of Glass</p>
      <p>For What It’S Worth</p>
      <p>Morning Glory</p>
      <p>Columbia</p>
      <p>Stand By Me</p>
      <p>Once</p>
      <p>Why Me Why Not?</p>
      <p>Greedy Soul</p>
      <p>The River</p>
      <p>Gas Panic</p>
      <p>Wonderwall</p>
      <p>Acquiesce</p>
      <p>Roll With It</p>
      <p>Supersonic</p>
      <p>Champagne Supernova</p>
      <p>Cigarettes and Alcohol</p>
      <p>The crowd were so into For What It’s Worth he was able to take a breather at the chorus and let them take over.</p>
      <p>The atmosphere was electric now and he switched seamlessly back to the band material with the much-loved Morning Glory, Columbia and Stand by Me.</p>
      <p>Liam has a misplaced reputation for a being a bit of a shouter but he proved with recent hit Once just how good his voice is.</p>
      <p>A really cool, chilled out, acoustic version of Greedy Soul followed and it was soon time to ramp up the nostalgia with everyone’s favourite karaoke song, Wonderwall.</p>
      <p>The encore had the whole place belting out every lyric, and it’s no wonder with classics like Acqueisce, Roll With It and Supersonic, before the Hydro was a sea of phone lights and arms for Champagne Supernova.</p>
      <p>He came back out to treat them to one last track and it was another crowd-pleaser in Cigarettes and Alcohol.</p>
      <p>The fans seemed to absolutely love the mixture of Oasis numbers and fresh material and after a performance like that Liam had every right to swagger off with the same confidence he came out with.</p>
