            <b>LAL vs SAC Dream11 : Western Conference leader’s Los Angeles Lakers take on a floundering and beleaguered Sacramento Kings today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Coming into today’s encounter with two straight wins, Los Angeles Lakers find themselves firmly planted and hammered down in the annuls of the Western Conference. The 9-2 record which the side have after 11 matches is the best out of all the teams partaking in the conference, seeing the team having tasted the most number of wins and the least number of defeats in unison.</p>
          <p>The team make an advent into today’s tie having dominated and decimated Golden State Warriors in their most recent outing, a match which saw them register a comfortable 120-94 win. It was a clinical display from the side, one which not only left their opponents in dismay but saw them further affirm everyone of their colossal stature as stalwarts of NBA 2019-20.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere, their opponents of the day have found life in the ongoing edition of the league extremely hard with the side languishing in 10th place with the four wins and 6 defeats. However the side will be massively buoyed by their recent run of results, ones which have seen them overturn what was a horrid start to the season.</p>
                <p>The 107-99 win over Portland Trail Blazers in their foregone match saw the side not only get their second win in succession but with it also make it four wins out of five matches after failing to win even once in their opening five lashes. They’ll be looking to use this rampant momentum to put on a stern challenge infront of a mammoth opponent, one where the side will need to throw the kitchen sink and more if they are to pull off an upset today.</p>

                            <h3>LAL vs SAC Dream11 Point Guard</h3>
                            <p>Back for his side in the previous match, Rajon Rondo ended up registering the five points, seven assists and six rebounds in just 14 minutes to make the Los Angeles Lakers point guard our pick in this department of our Dream 11 setup. The player is bound to get an increased outing today as he looks to ease back into his side’s framework, a narrative which is set to see him register a solid slew of points.</p>
                            <p>From the opposition meanwhile we are opting for Yogi Ferrell, someone who’ll have a limited role today but one enough to justify his price tag and his capability to register good numbers in that time.</p>
                            <h3>LAL vs SAC Dream11 Shooting Guard </h3>
                            <p>If Sacramento Kings are to have any chance of winning today, they’ll need to ensure that they end up converting the possession they’ll’ be accorded with into treys. With Los Angeles Lakers such a well disciplined and responsible side in defence, the Kings will be asked to repeatedly shoot from outside the circle, something which will see Bogdan Bogdanovic be heavily involved for the side today.</p>
                            <h3>LAL vs SAC Dream11 Small Forward</h3>
                            <p>His 24 points per clash along with the 11.1 assists per encounter see him topping the ranks of assist providers for his team to see LeBron James be inducted in our team’s outfit for the day. The small forward has not only set himself outside the circle to lay down the ball for open triples but has also laid up moves for his counterpart articulately to make him a must have player for the contest.</p>
                            <h3>LAL vs SAC Dream11 Power Forward</h3>
                            <p>Anthony Davis has been nursing a shoulder injury all season, one which saw him out for the side’s last outing but he should be back for this one with the player well rested. His numbers made him a regulation pick for us, the focal point and talisman of his team’s framework with the power forward having pulled off the 26.4 points and 11.4 rebounds per fixture.</p>
                            <p>Jared Dudley will also be a part of our side from the team while from the other side we are moving in with Nemanja Bjelica given his two toned nature which will see him canter his way under both the paints today.</p>
                            <h3>LAL vs SAC Dream11 Centre</h3>
                            <p>JaVale McGee from the home side is the last layer being hammered down into our Dream 11 unit to bring down the curtains on our side for this one.</p>
                            <h3>Star Player</h3>
                            <p>We will continue to stick with Anthony Davies as our star player for the day.</p>
