      <h1>Viacom Keeps Cable Syndication Rights for 'Office' and 'Parks &amp; Rec'</h1>
      <h2>Both series are heading from Netflix to NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming service</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:00:10+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/tim-b/" target="_blank">Tim Baysinger</a></address>
      <p>While “The Office” and “Parks &amp; Recreation” will soon be moving their streaming homes from Netflix to Peacock, Viacom has made sure that both NBC comedies will remain on its cable TV channels.</p>
      <p>“The Office” will remain exclusive to Comedy Central through 2021, and then will be available on Viacom’s media networks like Comedy Central, Paramount Network and TV Land on a non-exclusive basis (meaning it can run on other cable networks not tied to Viacom) through 2025. The Steve Carell-led comedy will move from Netflix to Peacock, NBCUniversal’s upcoming streaming service, in 2021. “Parks &amp; Recreation,” which will be available on Peacock by next fall — Peacock will launch sometime in the spring — will remain on Comedy Central through 2024.</p>
      <p>Terms of the deals were not disclosed.</p>

      <p>“Keeping the exclusive rights to ‘The Office’ through 2021 is a coup for Comedy Central and Viacom,” said Tanya Giles, GM of Comedy Central, Paramount Network, TV Land and Assistant to the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin. “Since acquiring it, we’ve reinvigorated the franchise on linear, drawing big audiences throughout our full day schedule. It’s also been a key lead-in to help drive viewers to our own original, acclaimed comedies. We’re so excited to keep it on our air that we wouldn’t even trade it for an iPod.”</p>
      <p>The renewals follow Viacom’s deal for “Seinfeld” cable syndication rights, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/viacom-cable-rights-seinfeld-from-sony/">which begin</a> in Oct. 2021.</p>

Thanks to streaming services like Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu and Amazon Prime, there are a ton of great shows you can stream while you're avoiding sunlight. Here are 26 that you'll be able to wrap up before heading back to work next week.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Altered Carbon" (Netflix)<br/></b>A gritty sci-fi murder mystery, "Altered Carbon" takes place in the distant future, where consciousness can be downloaded and people can switch bodies to live forever -- if they can afford it. Action-packed and twisty, "Altered Carbon" is a great 10-episode mystery to work through on your days off.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Lost in Space" (Netflix)<br/></b>Netflix rebooted the 1960s sci-fi TV show "Lost in Space," creating a more modern version of the Robinson family that feels grounded, while still "out there" in a similar way as the original. Parker Posey is also a standout as the slimy Dr. Smith in the 10-episode first season.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"The Runaways" (Hulu)<br/></b>The first Marvel show to make it to Hulu is a refreshing change from the Netflix takes. It follows a group of teenagers as they realize not only that they're special, but that their conspiratorial parents are not to be trusted. At 10 episodes, it's a quick watch and an interesting take on superhero TV shows.<cite>Hulu</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Jack Ryan" (Amazon Prime)<br/></b>Amazon gives a new look at Tom Clancy's many-storied spy, with John Krasinski taking on the role of the CIA analyst who quickly finds himself trying to take down terrorists. The eight-episode season is a relatively quick watch but has plenty of action and intrigue to keep viewers engaged.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Wormwood" (Netflix)<br/></b>Directed by legendary documentarian Errol Morris, the hybrid docu-drama miniseries "Wormwood" digs into the story of a man's death, reportedly as part of a CIA experiment in the 1950s. But as files are declassified and more information comes to light, "Wormwood" tells the story of a possible Cold War conspiracy, reenacted by some top Hollywood talent. If you're looking for a new true crime obsession, the six-part miniseries is perfect.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>

Turns out, he's not especially good at anything else. Riffing on classics like "Back to the Future," "Future Man" is pretty funny, and pretty smart, too. And with one season out, it's easy to work through in a couple of lazy days.<cite>Hulu</cite></figcaption>

Before long, it becomes clear there' sci-fi spookiness afoot, as events start to mirror similar ones that happened 33 years ago. With the first season available, "Dark" is a quick watch that will keep you glued to your seat.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"The Orville" (Hulu)<br/></b>The first season of "The Orville" is all available on Hulu, and anybody itching for a return to old-school "Star Trek" should give it a shot. The show is basically what would happen if regular people served on the U.S.S. Enterprise -- a humorous and accessible take on the "Star Trek" formula, but which still gets what made those series so endearing.<cite>Fox</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>“The Night Of” (HBO Go, HBO Now)<br/></b>HBO’s short miniseries starts with an accusation and a murder, and spirals from there. Naz is a Muslim kid arrested for a murder he can’t remember if he committed, and even before his trial, the situation ripples out to affect everyone even remotely related to him or the crime. It’s a dark and dramatic look into the criminal justice system that goes beyond the usual police procedural.<cite>HBO</cite></figcaption>

The series gets even weirder after that, constantly posing mysterious questions about the woman's powers and her kidnapping.

"Castle Rock" is still airing new episodes weekly in the first season of the anthology series, but there are enough to make what's available a binge-worthy proposition.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>“Black Mirror” (Netflix)<br/></b>There are actually four seasons' worth of episodes of “Black Mirror” available on Netflix, but at only six episodes each, the series is just contained enough that you can get through the whole thing in a couple of days. It’s worth it, too, as “Black Mirror” puts a “Twilight Zone” twist on modern technology and human relationships.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>

The six-episode documentary miniseries goes through the story of Durst's early life and the disappearance of his wife, through two other deaths, and ends with a possible bombshell break in the case. It's the kind of binge watch material that's hard to pull away from.<cite>HBO</cite></figcaption>

With a star-studded cast that includes Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, Alexander Skarsgard and Laura Dern, and clocking in at only seven episodes, "Big Little Lies" is a quick, high-quality watch. A second season of the show is on the way, but it probably won't land until 2019, so you've got plenty of time to catch up.<cite>HBO</cite></figcaption>

Each case will leave viewers wondering if the people in question really are the perpetrators, or if police misconduct, psychological probing and other factors are really to blame for creating false confessions. There are no easy answers, but the questions "The Confession Tapes" raises about the American justice system are definitely interesting ones.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>
