      <p>To meet the increasing demand of doctors, the Uttar Pradesh government will start a new scheme under which all postgraduate (PG) medical students will work as resident doctors at district hospitals with more than 200 beds for a period of three months.</p>
      <p>Currently, PG students are appointed as resident doctors in big hospitals and medical institutions.</p>
      <p>While the scheme, an idea of the Union Health Ministry and the Medical Council of India (MCI), will be called ‘district resident scheme’, the students working at the hospitals will be called district residents.</p>
      <p>Director General (DG) Medical Education Dr KK Gupta said that the scheme will start in 2021, and the directorate had asked for a list of government hospitals with more than 200 beds. “The PG students, be that of MD or MS, will work in district level hospitals for three months after next year. This will help us in meeting the demand of doctor availability in our district hospitals. The district residents will attend patients and be given daily duties at their appointed hospital,” said Gupta.</p>
      <p>He said that the idea came from the Union Health Ministry as it was found that the current strength of specialist doctors was not sufficient to meet the demand, and later, the MCI discussed this in a meeting with all the chief secretaries and DGs on November 8 this year. He added that the scheme would also help the future medical specialists in being familiar with the primary health services provided in the districts. “The idea is also that every branch student will be sent somewhere as per their curriculum and expertise. And students will be sent away from their home district so that they can learn more on the ground,” said Gupta. “As per my knowledge, most of our district hospitals have more than 200 beds, if counted together for both male and female,” he added.</p>
      <p>The students are likely to join from their third or fourth semester in 2021. Until then, they will be working only in bigger medical institutions and universities.</p>
