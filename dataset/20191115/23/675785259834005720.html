      <p>Gareth Southgate has promised a strong show of “support” for Joe Gomez after he was left devastated after being booed by England fans.</p>
      <p>Southgate confirmed he and other players spent a long time after the game on Thursday night trying to console the shell-shocked defender.</p>
      <p>Gomez, 22, would be ready to play in Kosovo on Sunday as he is keen to put the whole episode behind him and that would also be a popular move within the squad.</p>
      <p>Southgate had already been considering giving Harry Maguire a rest after he has played a lot of minutes for club and country recently and that could open the door for either Gomez or Tyrone Mings.</p>

      <p>England boss Southgate has yet to decide but rates Gomez highly and regards him as a potential starter when he is playing regularly for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>The England coaching staff have also been impressed with the way Gomez has dealt with the fall-out from the bust-up with Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>Sterling has accepted full responsibility for what happened and it was Gomez who asked Southgate not to punish his England team mate which makes it even harder to understand the negative reaction from the Wembley crowd.</p>

      <p>Southgate and his coach Chris Powell - who knows Gomez from his time at Charlton - spent time with the Liverpool defender and his family who were in the stands at Wembley to support him.</p>
      <p>Gomez left the stadium in slightly brighter spirits and trained normally on Friday with his team mates also rallying round because he is a very popular player in the squad.</p>
      <p>Southgate is desperate to try and support Gomez and help him through a very distressing and difficult week.</p>
      <p>Southgate said: “Look, it’s for us to pick him up. He’s a young player who’s had a difficult week, and my priority is to support him.</p>
      <p>“But I know all of the lads are going to get around him. I just know that’s happening now and will happen over the next few days.</p>
      <p>“The whole dressing room are together. I think the reaction that Raheem has given with that statement (on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> ) shows that they’re very, very close and we’re hugely disappointed for Joe [Gomez].</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t deserve that in any way, shape or form. I’ll repeat what I said earlier: no England player in an England shirt should be booed.”</p>
