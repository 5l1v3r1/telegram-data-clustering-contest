          <p>Well versed and aware of each other capabilities, the junior teams of Bangladesh and India are two outfits who each other quietly nicely. The two have gone at loggerheads on a haord of occasions across the course of 2019, navigating their way through different countries and tournamnets with India rejoicing on the majority of occasions.</p>
          <p>It’s a gripping narrative the overwhelming favourites for the ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup will be looking to emanate come today as well when they take on Bangladesh in one of the four clashes scheduled for the day.

                <p>Both the sides are making an advent into today’s face off against each other having tasted consummate success the last time around with astounding wins seeing the sides set a statement. Playing against Nepal, India eased their way to a three wicket win as they chased down the meagre 194 run target set infront of them with a full 8 overs to spare.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, playing against Hong Kong in their tournamnet opener, Bangladesh cantered their way to a colossal 9 wicket win, one which saw them chase down the target of 165 without even requiring half of the overs at their disposal. Given their previous displays and the staunch stature of both of our opponents of the day, this tie is poised to be one of the most enticing and riveting affairs </p>

                      <p>An extremely exquisite batting surface, the batting conducive conditions prevelant over here are going to make this is a high scoring encounter. What will see the side chasing is not only the fact that the wicket maintains its shape across the 100 overs but also the fact that the morning start will see the pacers get deviation with the new ball. </p>

                            <h3>BD-ET vs IND-ET Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>India’s opener and wicket-keeper, Arun Juyal got the 29 runs the last time around but what impressed more was the application and patience the payer displayed as he strung it out for 43 balls to make him our choice in this department of our Dream 11 side.</p>
                            <p>Zakir Ali from the other side comes in as well as we opt for a two man facet over here.</p>
                            <h3>BD-ET vs IND-ET Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Arman Jaffer got a half-century in the last tie, stitching together a behemoth 97 run winning partnership for the side for the second wicket to make them him an instant pick for us in this docket of our side. We are also brining in Chinmay Sutar and Yash Rathod who ended up taking three wickets with the ball as we opt for an entire trivalent from the Asian giants.</p>
                            <p>From Bangladesh meanwhile we are roping in opening Naim Sheikh after he registered the 52 runs for his side against Hong Kong and partook in a momentous 94 run opening partnership for the outfit.</p>
                            <h3>BD-ET vs IND-ET Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Top scoring for India in the bygone contest with the 56 runs sees Sanvir Singh become a must have choice for us for the day. The player sent down a restrictive brand of bowling, giving away just 20 runs in 6 over, seeing him manifest his skill set with both the bat and ball and use the repertoire of traits imbued him make him a pinch perfect all-rounder.</p>
                            <h3>BD-ET vs IND-ET Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>After they sent Honk Kong back to the pavilion for a mere 163, it was only befitting of us to heavily pack up our bowling component with the picks from Bangladesh, seeing us get in a barrage of options from the side. We begin with Mahedi Hasan who ended up with tenacious figures of 2-23 alongside Hasan Mahmud.</p>
                            <p>The two bowlers will be lining up our unit from India as well with Aditya Thakare and Siddharth Desai making for an indomitable partnership, two names who’ll strike at regular intervals to rise to the occasion for the side today.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Mendis will be made our team’s captain for the tie while Asalanka comes into our side as the vice-captain.</p>
