      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 23): With just over six weeks left in 2019, the benchmark for Malaysian equities is still hovering near multi-year lows.</p>
      <p>Year-to-date, Malaysian equities bellwether, the FBMKLCI has been one of the region’s worst performers, declining 5.67% year-to-Nov 15.</p>
      <p>But historical trends suggest that a recovery spurt could be in the offing as the year draws to a close.</p>
      <p>Some fund managers The Edge spoke to say that there are positive signals recently that may boost market sentiment surrounding big-cap stocks. In turn, that may provide tactical opportunities to ride any window-dressing effect that may arise as the year comes to a close.</p>
      <p>Historical data shows that the ten-year period between 2009 and 2018, Bursa Malaysia’s FBMKLCI Index has rallied in the final quarter for seven out of ten years, rising between 2.35% and 10.35%.</p>
      <p>In the three years that the index recorded a net decline in the final three months of each year, there was a noticeable rebound near the end.</p>
      <p>Will this year be the same?</p>
