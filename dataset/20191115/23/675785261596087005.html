      <h2>Blondie singer Debbie Harry has said that beekeeping can "influence our survival" as she hails Greta Thunberg as the modern “Joan of Arc for the earth"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:20:23+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:20</time> by <a rel="author">Ashleigh Rainbird, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ashleigh-rainbird/</a></address>
      <p>DEBBIE Harry has told how she is saving the planet through beekeeping insisting: “It can influence our survival.”</p>
      <p>The Blondie singer, 74, admits she gets a buzz from the craft she has been honing over the past two years.</p>
      <p>Talking to the Mirror as she backed our MillionMirorTrees campaign, punk rocker Debbie said: “It is possibly one of the few things that I can do that directly influences our survival. Much of our agricultural productivity is dependent on honey bees.</p>
      <p>“It is important that our attention is drawn to their plight. When the honey bee suffers, so does agriculture, and so, potentially do all who depend on the bounty that comes from animal pollinated flowering plants from which we derive many of our most fruits and vegetables.”</p>

      <p>In our climate edition on Thursday we told how the entire species of polar bears could be wiped out by the end of the century, children in polluted Indian cities are getting respiratory diseases normally suffered by elderly smokers and how some of Britain’s most beautiful spots have been destroyed by fly tipping.</p>
      <p>But Debbie said she had been most shocked by the expansion of deserts in North Africa “as rainfall dries up on farmland” adding: “Climate change-driven desertification is not a phenomenon unique to the Sahara.”</p>
      <p>Debbie believes many of the world’s problems are down to overpopulation.</p>

      <p>She said: “Overpopulation is a major cause of many of the world’s problems. Whether it is a question of food shortage, lack of clean drinking water or energy shortages, every country in the world is affected by it – or will be.”</p>
      <p>In 2017, she named her album Pollinator and she says nature has always been central to her life as well as describing Greta Thunberg as the modern “Joan of Arc for the earth.”</p>

      <p>She said: “It is incredibly important, nature amazes because of all it offers… new and startling experiences, great beauty, while hiding mysteries that we may never understand. I feel a responsibility and want to help raise awareness.”</p>
