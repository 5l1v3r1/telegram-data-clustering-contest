        <i>Behrouz Boochani, the Kurdish Iranian refugee and journalist who became the voice of those incarcerated by Australia on Manus Island, has landed in New Zealand. Over months, an international effort helped to coordinate his long flight to freedom. ‘Now I am free,’ Boochani tells Guardian Australia reporter Ben Doherty. ‘When I arrived in Auckland it was very strange because for the first time I looked at Manus in a different way. I was thinking about surviving, how I survive. And I was happy that finally I survived.’<br/>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/16/behrouz-boochani-manus-says-simply-i-did-my-best">Behrouz Boochani, brutalised but not beaten by Manus, says simply: ‘I did my best’</a></i>
