      <p>SIEM REAP, Nov 16 — Cambodia will ban all elephant rides at the country’s famed Angkor temple park by early next year, an official said yesterday, a rare win for conservationists who have long decried the popular practice as cruel.</p>
      <p>The Angkor archaeological complex in northern Siem Reap attracts the bulk of the kingdom’s foreign tourists — which topped six million in 2018 — and many opt for elephants rides around the ancient temples.</p>
      <p>But these rides “will end by the start of 2020”, said Long Kosal, a spokesman with the Apsara Authority, which manages the park.</p>
      <p>“Using elephants for business is not appropriate anymore,” he told AFP, adding that some of the animals were “already old”.</p>
      <p>So far, five of the 14 working elephants have been transferred to a community forest about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away from the temples.</p>
      <p>“They will live out their natural lives there,” Kosal said.</p>
      <p>The company that owns the elephants will continue to look after them, he added. </p>
      <p>Cambodia has long come under fire from animal rights groups for ubiquitous elephant rides on offer for tourists, also seen in neighbouring Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. </p>
      <p>The elephants are broken in during training and rights groups have accused handlers of overworking them.</p>
      <p>In 2016, a female elephant died by the roadside after carrying tourists around the Angkor Wat temple complex in severely hot weather.</p>
      <p>The animal had been working for around 45 minutes before she collapsed. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
