      <p>The Apprentice’s Lewis Ellis branded Lord Alan Sugar a ‘boomer’ in a bizarre Twitter row over tattoos – and no one knows quite what to think.</p>
      <p>Things kicked off between the pair when the BBC One candidate hit back at trolls over his wide array of tattoos – which he showed off on this week’s show.</p>
      <p>Having none of it, the 28-year-old shared a topless snap of himself, flaunting all his inking for his 4,155 followers.</p>
      <p>‘Back to rule #1 f**k what people think about you,’ he captioned the topless snap.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you everyone that took the time to show some support for my “horrific” tattoos and pointing out no one has the right to judge you or your body. #theapprentice #tattoos #inked #inkedlife.’</p>
      <p>However, things got a little heated when Alan slid in there with his famed wit, comparing the BBC candidate to a ‘Kindle’.</p>

      <p>Nope, us neither.</p>

      <p>Quoting Lewis’ tweet, he replied: ‘Lewis your tattoos tell your story. What are you a Kindle.</p>
      <p>‘You have the right to do what you want to your body. I have the right of an opinion. I say they are horrible. When you’re 50 on the beach you’ll wear a T-shirt.</p>
      <p>‘You will be an embarrassment to your kids.’</p>
      <p>Ermmm, that’s actually quite harsh, Sugs.</p>

      <p>And it seems the marketing worker wasn’t too impressed with his potential boss’ words, simply posting: ‘Ok boomer’.</p>
      <p>He’s also pinned the message to his profile, proving he’s quite proud of his comeback.</p>
      <p>However, Lewis’ reply has fans convinced that he won’t be winning The Apprentice this year…</p>
      <p>‘Got a feeling Lewis doesn’t win…,’ one replied, while another agreed: ‘Well… I’m guessing that you’re not the winner of The Apprentice this year.</p>
      <p>‘Or, if you are, I assume it’s safe to say things are a touch frosty…’</p>
      <p>This definitely might make boardroom meetings a tad awkward.</p>
