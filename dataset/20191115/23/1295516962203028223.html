      <p><u><b>MOVIE URBAN LEGEND</b></u>: Frank Miller wrote the "Ninja Rap" for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.</p>
      <p>The second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film is probably not the most memorable sequel in comic book film history, but it is still well remembered for the bizarre "Ninja Rap" by Vanilla Ice, which included the Turtles fighting some bad guys inside of a night club and then the rapper (played by Vanilla Ice) coming up with a rap that the Turtls then dance to during the rap performance, with Vanilla Ice infamously rapping "Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go!"</p>

      <p>Bizarre, right?</p>
      <p>It actually had a video single version!</p>

      <p>Anyhow, my pal Noah D. brought up recently a factoid he had seen that that rap was actually written by Frank Miller, the famous comic book creator.</p>
      <p>Oddly enough, here is Frank Miller's Wikipedia page at the moment...</p>
      <blockquote>Frank Miller (born January 27, 1957) is an American comic book writer, novelist, inker, screenwriter, film director, and producer best known for his comic book stories and graphic novels such as Ronin, Daredevil: Born Again, The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One, Sin City, and 300. He also wrote the Ninja Rap sung by Vanilla Ice featured in the second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film.</blockquote>
      <p>That is not the case. Vanilla Ice wrote the rap himself.</p>
      <p>The story comes from the popular web series, Best of the Worst, with comic book artist Freddie Williams III as their guest.</p>
      <p>They discussed the "Ninja Rap"....</p>

      <p>Freddie Williams III was explaining how Frank Miller's comic book work in the 1980s was sort of the basis for the explosion of dumbed-down ninja stuff in the 1980s, especially the <a href="https://screenrant.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-original-best-episodes/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> (since Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles is basically a Miller parody).</p>
      <p>And so one of the hosts notes that Miller also wrote the song "Ninja Rap."</p>
      <p>Fans since then have, as a joke, continued to put that "fact" on to Miller's Wikipedia page.</p>
      <p>The legend is..</p>
      <p><u>STATUS</u>: False</p>
      <p>Thanks to Noah D. for the suggestion!</p>
