      <h1>Academies beating private schools for university places</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:34:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/camilla-turner/" target="_blank">Camilla Turner</a></address>
      <p>Private schools are less successful at getting students into <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/14/universities-including-oxford-cambridge-risk-downgrade-donor/">university than academies, an analysis of Ucas data reveals.</a></p>
      <p>Of the 91,485 school-leavers from academies who applied for British last year, 87.81 per cent were successful, compared to 87.14 per cent of the 34,630 private school students according to figures from the university admissions service.</p>
      <p>Pupils from academies were more likely than their peers from all other types of school - including grammars and sixth form colleges - to get a place at the university they applied to. </p>
      <p>Academies were originally pioneered by New Labour in the 1990s as a way of driving up standards at schools in deprived inner city areas.</p>
      <p>They were subsequently rolled out on a much larger scale under the coalition Government in 2010 and, along with free schools, now make up the majority of state schools in England.</p>
      <p>Academies are not under local authority control and instead are funded by the Education and Skills Funding Agency, an executive agency of the Department for Education.</p>
      <p>Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts which represents academies, told the Times Education Supplement magazine that the results demonstrated "the power of a group of schools working together in the interest of children and young people”.</p>
      <p>The Ucas data does not show which universities pupils from different types of schools are applying to, and it could be the case that private school pupils are trying for places at more competitive institutions.</p>
      <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the figures are a “testament to the fantastic commitment that many academies show towards their pupils”.</p>
      <p>He said: “In the past, people have not lacked aspiration but they have sometimes lacked the wherewithal to realise their aspirations. Now that academies have some of the freedoms that come with independence, it has become easier for people from a range of school types to reach higher education.  </p>
      <p>“Some schools serving middle-class pupils may be coasting and doing what they’ve always done while other schools serving more diverse communities have been making bigger strides.”</p>
