      <p>A DOCUMENTARY on autism, made by a team from Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), has bagged a national award for the best film of the year in the ‘educational programme’ category in the UGC-CEC (University Grants Commission-Consortium for Education Communication) Educational Video Competition.</p>
      <p>Directed by Vasim Pathan, Living with Autism is a documentary film made by the Educational Media Research Centre (EMMRC) at SPPU.</p>
      <p>Pathan, also an alumnus of the Department of Media and Communication Studies (DMCS) at SPPU, through his film has tried to raise awareness on autism showcasing the lives of children with autism. His film has bagged a citation, where the documentary will be presented with a certificate.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the award-winning documentary to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, Pathan said, “The film is about autism. It is a major issue among parents of these special children, as they do not easily accept their child’s condition. We have interviewed experts who are working in this field for the past 20 to 25 years. The attempt was to bring out the challenges while working with these children and their parents. The highlight of the documentary is also the story of an autistic child who bagged a world record.”</p>
      <p>Sharing the challenges that the film crew faced while working with children with autism, Pathan said, “Filming the children was tough and so was making their parents open up about their situation.”</p>
      <p>On his future projects, the budding director said, “There is a documentary planned on yoga, for which work is on. While most of our work is related to education, we have another upcoming project on tribals.”</p>
