      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14001/colin-kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a>'s workout will go on as scheduled Saturday with more than 24 NFL teams now expected to attend, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Friday.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick is in Atlanta preparing for the 3 p.m. ET workout, which is being held at the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons">Falcons</a>' training complex just outside Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Sources told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that the NFL is providing three wide receivers for the workout. But the league has not given out the names of those receivers, so Kaepernick is bringing former NFL wideouts who volunteered to fly in on their own. He may bring in up to five of his own receivers, sources told Fowler.</p>
      <p>One receiver expected to attend the workout is Bruce Ellington, a source told Fowler. Ellington played with Kaepernick on the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> in 2014 and 2015.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, his receivers and NFL officials conducting Saturday's workout will not be allowed into the facility until about 2 p.m. ET, when the Falcons are scheduled to depart for Carolina for their Sunday matchup with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers">Panthers</a>, a source told Schefter. The Falcons are supplying an equipment person, a trainer and a videographer to help the NFL conduct Kaepernick's workout.</p>
      <p>Former NFL coach Hue Jackson will lead the drills, and former NFL coach Joe Philbin will be in attendance to assist, the league said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The NFL previously said 11 teams were committed to attend: the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>, Atlanta Falcons, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins">Washington Redskins</a>. The league expected additional teams to commit.</p>
      <p>Sources told ESPN that the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> and 49ers will attend. Sources had told ESPN that the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> will go, but owner Jerry Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that his team will not have a representative at the workout.</p>
      <p>The league reiterated that it will send video of the workout and an interview with Kaepernick to all 32 teams.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, 32, has been out of football since 2016, the year he began protesting police brutality and racial injustice by kneeling during the pregame national anthem.</p>
