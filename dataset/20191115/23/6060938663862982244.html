      <p>NEW DELHI: The government on Friday said the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) will be applicable to systemically important <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/financial-service-providers">financial service providers</a> (FSPs), other than banks.</p>
      <p>The rules shall apply to FSPs or categories of FSPs, to be notified by the central government under section 227 from time-to-time in consultation with appropriate regulators, for purpose of their insolvency and liquidation proceedings. The move to include FSPs comes against the backdrop of the crisis confronting the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) sector. Finance minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nirmala-Sitharaman">Nirmala Sitharaman</a>, who also heads the corporate affairs ministry, said code was applicable to companies but did not provide for insolvency resolution of financial firms.</p>
      <p>"In an environment where it may be necessary to invoke something akin to IBC and in absence of IBC like provision for the financial services sector we have brought out this notification under 227 within IBC which can be used. Post this, it is up to the RBI to take a call on this," Sitharaman said.</p>
      <p>"Whether we will have something equivalent to IBC for financial sector we will address that in future. We want to bring something equivalent to IBC for the financial sector. Till such time this will take care of financial institutions," Sitharaman said.</p>
      <p>Injeti Srinivas, secretary, corporate affairs, said the special framework for financial service providers was essentially aimed at serving as an interim mechanism to deal with any exigency pending introduction of a full-fledged enactment to deal with financial resolution of banks and other systemically important financial service providers.</p>
