      <p>
        <b>1. Starts Sunday</b>
      </p>
      <p>The parade — which is free of charge — starts at 1 p.m. The route begins around Idylwyld Drive and 19th Street, proceeds east along 19th Street and turns left onto Third Avenue, makes a right turn onto 20th Street and then a left turn onto Fourth Avenue. From there, the parade proceeds north until turning left onto 22nd Street East, and then heads west until making a left turn onto First Avenue. At that point, Santa will step down from his sleigh in front of Midtown Plaza.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Grand Marshal</b>
      </p>
      <p>White Buffalo Youth Lodge is serving as the parade’s official grand marshal. There are 65 floats registered; parade goers are able to vote for their favourite by texting the corresponding float number to 306-540-HOHO (4646).</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Traffic affected</b>
      </p>
      <p>Organizers typically expect around 25,000 people to line the streets, inviting them to bring chairs and blankets, hot chocolate and coffee. Parking and lane restrictions will be in effect from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., during which time there will be no access to the parade route between Idylwyld Drive, 19th Street, Fourth Avenue, 22nd Street East and First Avenue.</p>

        <b>4. Nice weather</b>
      </p>
      <p>The forecast high for Sunday is 6 C. That’s certainly more comfortable than in 2003, when the parade was cancelled due to cold weather. It was so frigid — the wind chill hit -32 C that morning — the marching bands were unable to play because their instruments would instantly freeze up.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Who benefits?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Proceeds from the parade go to Ronald McDonald House Charities Saskatchewan.</p>
