      <p>A two-year wait to give a murdered baby her funeral has been called a ‘disgrace’ by the senior coroner sitting on the inquest of her death.</p>
      <p>Eve Leatherland has been kept in deep freeze since October, 2017 when she was beaten, poisoned and left to die aged just 22 months by her mother and step father.</p>
      <p>She suffered two skull fractures, 12 rib fractures and eventually died after being given a fatal dose of codeine in an attempt to cover up her injuries.</p>
      <p>Mother Abigail Leatherland, 26, and her former partner Tom Curd, 31, were jailed in March after a Truro Crown Court heard they browsed Facebook and played video games as Eve lay dying.</p>
      <p>Leatherland was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for allowing or causing Eve to die, while Curd was ordered to serve life with a minimum of 20 years for murder.</p>

      <p>The inquest this week at Plymouth Coroners’ Court heard legal wrangling involving Eve’s alleged biological father Dean Bird had meant she had still not had a funeral.</p>

      <p>Mr Bird is not named on Eve’s birth certificate and her body will only be released when the courts determine who is next of kin.</p>
      <p>Senior Coroner Ian Arrow told the inquest that Mr Bird had been informed in September last year to go to court to confirm he is Eve’s natural father.</p>
      <p>Mr Arrow finished his statement by highlighting that funding was available to ensure bereaved parents did not have to pay for the cost of their child’s burial or cremation.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the inquest, Mr Arrow said that it was ‘disgraceful’ the baby’s body had still to be released, more than two years since she died.</p>

      <p>Mr Arrow said: ‘[There] still needs to be a funeral for poor Eve. I will hope that Eve has a funeral in the near future</p>
      <p>The inquest heard that Leatherland and Curd phoned an ambulance for Eve saying she had become ‘unresponsive and floppy’ at home in Liskeard, Cornwall.</p>
      <p>Paramedics found Eve in a dirty stained bed with vomit around her mouth. She was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth where she died.</p>
      <p>At first Eve’s death was not treated as suspicious with bruising believed to be caused by efforts to resuscitate her.</p>

      <p>A subsequent x-ray revealed a fractured skull and a post-mortem investigation at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London concluded that ‘no natural cause of death could be ascertained’, Mr Arrow said.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Mr Arrow told the inquest that Eve died from a ‘fatal concentration’ of the adult pain-killer codeine which should never be given to children, he said, and her multiple injuries.</p>
      <p>She also had an amount of paracetamol in her system which was ‘above therapeutic levels’.</p>
