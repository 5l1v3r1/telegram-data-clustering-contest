      <p>SANTA CLARITA: Police investigating a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/two-killed-in-california-school-shooting-teen-in-custody-12095082">high school shooting in California</a> said on Friday (Nov 15) they still did not know what motivated the suspect, who killed two classmates and wounded three others before shooting himself in the head and collapsing.</p>
      <p>Thursday morning's shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, about 65km north of Los Angeles, took place in a matter of just seconds. The suspect pulled a .45 semi-automatic pistol from his backpack in an outdoor school courtyard and opened fire.</p>

      <p>Sheriff Alex Villanueva of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said on Friday that why was the question of the day.</p>
      <p>"This kind of came out of the blue," the sheriff told CNN. "It shocked everyone who knew him."</p>
      <p>Police have not released the name of the suspect, but have said it was his 16th birthday on Thursday. Authorities said he was in grave condition at a hospital.</p>
      <p>"He saved the last round for himself," Villanueva said.</p>
      <p>Investigators are looking into the suspect's past and social media accounts and interviewing people who knew him, the sheriff added.</p>
      <p>"We're still digging," he said.</p>
      <p>The FBI is assisting in the investigation and police do not know yet where the suspect got the weapon, the sheriff said.</p>
      <p>Two girls aged 14 and 15 were being treated at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, California and were listed in good and fair condition, a hospital spokeswoman said early on Friday.</p>
      <p>At the Henry Mayo Hospital in Santa Clarita, authorities said a 14-year-old boy was treated and released, and the other students taken there died.</p>
      <p>No names of the wounded or the dead were released yet, but the two slain students were a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy.</p>
      <p>Captain Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said surveillance video footage showed the suspect opening fire from a single stationary position and shooting his victims in rapid succession before turning the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>The scene at Saugus High School was reminiscent of other mass shootings at US schools, including Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a former student with an assault gun killed 17 people on Feb 14, 2018.</p>
      <p>It was the 85th incident of gunfire at a school this year, according to Everytown, a gun control advocacy group.</p>
      <p>Police said the suspect had acted alone. Investigators descended on his family home, blocking off the street. They found no further danger there.</p>
