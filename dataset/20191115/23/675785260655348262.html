      <h2>India had no qualms pointing out it was a bad pun on her behalf as she hit back at the trolls in a message</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:59:10+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>

      <p>The Love Islander come under fire from critics who accused of her of spelling Dubai wrong when she took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to share a bikini selfie from the gorgeous destination.</p>
      <p>She had captioned the post: "Dubae."</p>
      <p>India had no qualms pointing out it was a bad pun on her behalf when she told her trolls she knew how to spell the sizzling holiday hotspot.</p>
      <p>In an tirade, she typed off: "Shall we all calm down... I know how to spell 'Dubai'.</p>

      <p>"It clearly wasn't that punny... but it gets like that sometimes."</p>
      <p>Fans had swamped her bikini post with criticism about her spelling of Dubai.</p>
      <p>"It's Dubai learn how to spell," one fan wrote.</p>
      <p>"Its Dubai," another clarified.</p>
      <p>A sarcastic follower penned: "I want to go but canâ€™t find Dubae on for any flights have I spelt it wrong ?"</p>
      <p>It comes after she got candid on social media about not being able to fit in her dream pair of denim shorts she had taken on holiday.</p>
      <p>The brunette babe said she hadn't trained in six months after also packing a pair of training shorts that she takes everywhere with her but rarely uses.</p>
      <p>Coming into the villa late in the game, she quickly turned Ovie Soko's head and coupled up with the hunky basketball player.</p>
      <p>The pair recently called it quits, with India saying she's "not really" OK during last night's star-studded ITV Palooza.</p>
      <p>Taking to social media, she shared two snaps of her denim and training shorts with her million followers.</p>
      <p>The beauty, on the snap of her training shorts, wrote: "Everywhere I go I pack gym stuff...'in case I want to train.</p>
      <p>"I've not trained for six months in England why on earth would I suddenly start when I'm in beautiful sunshine surrounded by cocktails?"</p>
      <p>She continued her self-questioning over a picture of some vintage-looking denim shorts: "Also always pack the denim shorts that don't fit...ever hopeful.</p>
      <p>"Because after a 7 hour plane ride when you've got Kim K's swollen pregnant ankles and eaten all the food they'll be sliding right on."</p>
