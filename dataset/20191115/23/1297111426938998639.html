      <p>Vendors at the Centennial Market are relieved to be able to stay where they are, after U-Haul International pulled out of its deal to buy the Centennial Shopping Centre the day it was supposed to take possession of the building.</p>
      <p>U-Haul became a tenant in the Centennial Shopping Centre last fall. The company had planned to purchase the entire building, repurposing the former Sears warehouse —<a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/vendors-ponder-future-of-centennial-market-as-u-haul-poises-to-buy-old-sears-building"> where the Centennial Market had established itself</a> — for self-storage lockers and to add U-Box container storage off the load/unload bays.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/zoning-bylaw-rail-relocation-what-wrapped-up-at-city-council-this-week">In August, city council approved the zoning amendment U-Haul International needed to buy the Centennial Shopping Centre and turn their existing location into a full-service U-Haul and self-storage facility.</a>
      </p>
      <p>This caused mixed feelings among the market vendors, with some saying they did not want to leave the market’s current home while others insisted the market’s heart was in the people, not the place.</p>
      <p>Now knowing that they can stay in their current space for the foreseeable future is a load off of vendors’ minds, said Matt Thompson, who helps run the market and has been a vendor there for two years.</p>
      <p>“There was a lot of stress because we weren’t really sure what was going to happen and there was very little communication from U-Haul towards it or anything like that, so having a little bit more concrete knowledge of what is actually going to happen in the near future is much less stressful,” he said.</p>

      <p>On Nov. 6 — the day that U-Haul was supposed to take possession of the building — Thompson said he was told by the property manager Colliers International that U-Haul’s plans had changed.</p>
      <p>“They pulled out at the last minute and no one knows exactly what happened or why,” said Thompson.</p>
      <p>“After careful consideration, U-Haul concluded the Centennial Shopping Centre location was not ideal for our self-storage product at this time. As a result, we are no longer operating at 1230 Broad St.,” Ryan Pearson, president of U-Haul Company of Central Canada, said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to consider potential retail and self-storage locations in Regina and surrounding communities as they become available.”</p>
      <p>While Thompson said U-Haul had told vendors they would be able to stay for one to three years after they took possession of the building, there was no real guarantee. Now, with this added security, Thompson said the Centennial Market is ready to take on new vendors just in time for the holiday season.</p>
      <p>“We’re still there. We’re still open for business, and we’re ready for the holidays, ready for more vendors, and ready to just grow,” he said.</p>
