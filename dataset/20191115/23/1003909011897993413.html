      <h1>Gather at the island in Mesa's central galley kitchen</h1>

      <p>For many first-time buyers, a floor plan resembling a single-family home with the attainable price of a townhome is the ideal combination.</p>
      <p>This is part of what makes the Mesa model such an appealing option. The two-storey, 1,421-square-foot townhome is displayed as a show home in Arrive D’Arcy, a development by Partners in the Okotoks community of D’Arcy.</p>
      <p>These townhomes, which have a landscaped and fenced backyard, boast charming Craftsman exterior architecture, and use fibre cement board, which is a low-maintenance material.</p>
      <p>The Mesa’s layout and use of space are reminiscent of a well-designed laned single-family home.</p>
      <p>It can have two master bedrooms, which is how it’s displayed in the show home, or three bedrooms. With two masters, it’s strong fit for a young couple with one child, or a retired couple who want the space to host grandchildren for the weekend.</p>
      <p>A single person may also appreciate the dual master bedroom format, using the additional bedroom for guests or as a home office, and its closet to store clothes that are out of season.</p>

      <p>Both master bedrooms are generously proportioned, with the larger reaching 13 feet eight inches by 12 feet seven inches. They each have a spacious closet and ensuite. One of the ensuites features a shower with a glass door and the other has a tub and shower combination.</p>
      <p>Conveniently positioned at the centre of the second floor is a laundry area, with a front-load washer and dryer below a set of cabinets, behind double doors. This location is a short distance to both bedrooms, removing the need to haul a basket of clothes up and down stairs.</p>
      <p>On the main level, the standard kitchen is L-shaped, but as presented in the show home, there’s an option to make it a central galley design. Poised to be a social hub, its large island will draw a gathering with its extended eating bar that seats four people. The island also has a sink and sits beneath a row of stylish pendant lighting.</p>
      <p>This inviting cooking space has stainless steel appliances, shown with a chimney-style hoodfan, and plenty of storage, courtesy full-height cabinets with soft-close doors and drawers. Its backsplash boasts an eye-catching subway style.</p>
      <p>The open-concept main level receives plenty of sunlight through windows in both the rear-facing dining room — and especially — substantial panes in the front-facing 12-foot 11-inch by 14-foot great room. These windows are triple-glazed and low-emissivity, which is valuable for preventing heat loss.</p>
      <p>Finishing the basement adds 558 square feet of living space. This option features a rec area, bedroom and full bathroom.</p>
      <p>All townhomes built by Partners are certified Built Green. Homes can earn certification for energy efficiency through this national, industry-driven program, based on the materials and methods that go into the build.</p>
      <p>Among the features that support this aim in these townhomes are active heat recovery ventilators, water-saving faucets and low-flow toilets, and a 96 per cent high-efficiency furnaces with a tankless hot water boiler and fan coil.</p>
      <p>D’Arcy is a new master-planned community by Anthem United. It’s next to an 18-hole golf course, and provides quick access to both downtown Okotoks and Sheep River.</p>
