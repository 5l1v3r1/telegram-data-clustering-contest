      <h1>Thom Evans has 'sworn off sex' so he's not distracted from X Factor dream</h1>
      <h2>Rugby Hunk Thom has decided to abstain from 'indulging in women' until the end of the celebrity singing competition</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:43:06+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:43</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Wallis</a></address>
      <p>Rugby player <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/thom-evans">Thom Evans</a> is reportedly abstaining from sex throughout his Celebrity <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> experience.</p>
      <p>The hunky sportsman, 34, is currently competing in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> 's spin-off singing competition alongside fellow Rugby stars Ben Foden and Levi Davis in their band Try Star.</p>
      <p>Thom recently told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10356320/x-factor-thom-evans-off-sex-distractions/">The Sun</a> that he is so dedicated to Try Star's singing success, that he has decided to steer clear of any romance.</p>
      <p>He also admitted that he continues to receive a lot of sexual and romantic advances from both men and women.</p>

      <p>The band member confessed to the publication: "I have lots of men and women sliding into my DMs. I always try to reply."</p>
      <p>However, the star revealed he is only into the old-school way of dating and refuses to "date anyone from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> or an app."</p>
      <p>Shockingly, the X Factor hopeful also hinted at potential romances with his fellow singing contestants on the show, but said he is choosing not to "indulge".</p>
      <p>He teased: "I’m single and there are lots of lovely girls on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> but I’ve been focused on the band.</p>
      <p>"It’s been pretty stressful learning the songs so I’ve no time to indulge in women."</p>

      <p>Thom's severe dedication has come at a cost as he decided to give up his love of women in hope of winning the show and earning a record contract.</p>
      <p>Try Star have been wowing the judges from day one, when they stole the show during auditions with a very British and very unexpected rendition of Blackstreet's iconic No Diggity.</p>
      <p>The rugby boys are adamant they are in the competition to win it and want to be taken seriously.</p>
      <p>Thom's honesty about his love life comes after the star suffered an awkward clash with Louis Walsh.</p>

      <p>Last week, Thom didn't take too kindly to being called a "backing singer" along with Ben, over their latest performance with co-member Levi Davis.</p>
      <p>The trio were forced to change their song last minute as mentor Simon Cowell wasn't a fan, so they instead performed No Diggity for the second time.</p>
      <p>Louis blasted this decision, before claiming Levi was the star and his co-members were just "backing singers".</p>
