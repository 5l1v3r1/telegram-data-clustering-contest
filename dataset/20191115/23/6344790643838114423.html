      <h1>Wizards of the Coast Released 3 New Products on DMs Guild to Benefit Extra Life</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy Williams</a></address>
      <p>Wizards of the Coast recently released a few new products for <b><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i></b> fans to enjoy. There’s an adventure, an activity book for children, and the infernal font available for purchase now through DMs Guild. In addition, all money will go to support Extra Life.</p>
      <p>The new adventure is titled <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/294711/Infernal-Machine-Rebuild-5e?affiliate_id=1934285&amp;src=newsletterDMsGuild111219">Infernal Machine Rebuild</a> and it’s designed for a group of adventurers to progress from level 5 to level 10. Players will navigate two dungeons and encounter new monsters, magic items, and artifact powers from the player community. This adventure costs $9.99.</p>
      <blockquote>A fallen clock tower holds components from an ancient artifact. Upon discovery of the components, competing agents look to launch expeditions to uncover additional components scattered across distant places—and times. The now-lost Temple of Moloch and the construction site of the legendary Tomb of Horrors are two of those locations. However great the risks, finding the components demands the effort, for whoever does so can reassemble the fabled Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!</blockquote>
      <p>The activity book is <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/294712/Adventure-with-Muk-5e?affiliate_id=1934285&amp;src=newsletterDMsGuild111219">Adventure with Muk</a> and it just looks like a blast for young kids. It has adventure hooks, puzzles, character sheets, and every page can be colored! This is available for $4.99.</p>
      <blockquote>Meet Muk, the very bravest goblin, and his best friend Birdsquirrel. Adventure your way through the Dankwood and search for a great treasure that is rumored to be hidden far beyond.</blockquote>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/294284/Infernal-Font?affiliate_id=1934285&amp;src=newsletterDMsGuild111219">infernal font</a> is available as well! This will let you type up items in the cool devilish font for your personal and non-commercial use. You can use the font for one other thing though, products published and distributed on DMs Guild! You can purchase the font for $10.</p>
