        <b>ROBERT Florence admits that Burnistoun was a bit mad - but he reckons his new TV show is truly mental.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The State Of It sees the Glasgow-based comedy writer ripping into the state of today’s Scotland and the world at large.</p>

      <p>Featuring the type of sketches that made him famous, it would be easy to compare it with the hit that made he and pal Iain Connell famous a decade ago.</p>
      <p>But the 42-year-old insists Jolly Boy John and The Quality Polis will look tame in comparison when his new effort hits the box next week.</p>
      <p>Robert says: “We are looking at stuff going on and making jokes about it. We go quite hard in some places but pick and choose our targets.</p>
      <p>“It’s one of silliest shows. Burnistoun is really daft in places but The State Of It does some really different things</p>

      <p>“The show is an odd one, full force 100mph stuff.”</p>
      <p>In the first episode, The State of It sets its sights on technology and meets cutting edge beauty influencer, Kendra, who shares her corned beef master plan for world domination.</p>
      <p>Also, the team look at modern day sperm donation, genetic engineering by post and an ingenious music streaming service. Elsewhere, resident animators Will and Ainsley consider crypto currency.</p>
      <p>Scot Squad creator Joe Hullait is involved on the show both behind and in front of the camera.</p>
      <p>And Robert loved being able to act out sketches that he didn’t write himself.</p>

      <p>He says: “I loved being in sketches written by other people because it’s quite a freeing thing to not be thinking that you should have wrote it another way after the fact.</p>
      <p>“Burnistoun was a weird one beacuse with a sketch show like that, you feel pressure when you’re doing it.</p>
      <p>“It’s always fun but there’s pressure because it was established and people liked the sketches.</p>
      <p>“But the lucky thing with a long running sketch show like us is people forget all the s***e ones and just remember all the stuff as being brilliant and forget the ones that failed.</p>
      <p>“The idea in their head is that episodes were much better than they actually were.</p>
      <p>“That’s why it was nice to do something brand new. It was a clean slate and I loved it.”</p>
      <p>When the new BBC Scotland channel launched in February, it was promised that it would be bursting with new Scottish talent.</p>
      <p>Since then, some people have claimed its shows featured the same old faces instead of newbies.</p>
      <p>But The State Of It really does give the stars of tomorrow their first big break on telly.</p>
      <p>Alongside Robert, comic talent like Susan Riddell, Nathan Byrne, Rachel Jackson, Laura Lovemore and Bigg Taj plus many more are mainstays.</p>

      <p>When Burnistoun was at its peak, Robert and Iain never accepted submissions from aspiring writers.</p>
      <p>Now he wants to make up for what he reckons is one of his only regrets from the show.</p>
      <p>He says: “This is ultimately about developing new talent, that’s why I got involved. It wasn’t my idea. They came to me.</p>
      <p>“What interested me was helping with that. It’s a massively important thing when you get on the telly for the first time as a writer or performer.</p>
      <p>“Just the fact that your family sees you on telly justifies the work you’re doing.</p>
      <blockquote>“The show is an odd one, full force 100mph stuff.”<cite>Robert Florence</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“I’ve been doing this 20 years now which is too long. I should be long gone by now so I end up fans of all the people coming in.</p>
      <p>“When I got into the game there was a radio show Velvet Cabaret on BBC Radio Scotland looking for writers and Chewin’ the Fat were also accepting submissions.</p>
      <p>“But then there was a long spell without any opportunities.</p>
      <p>“And I have to shoulder part of the blame myself because me and Iain wrote Burnistoun ourselves and werent accepting any submissions which I reflect on a wee bit and think it’s ashame.”</p>
      <p>Robert adds: “For me it’s not so much about making the next big show like Burnistoun, it’s more about giving other people a chance to make that dream a reality and get on the telly.</p>

        <figcaption>Florence has recently started a wrestling podcast with Grado</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“People bang on about ratings but miss the big picture, there’s all these hours on the telly that need filled by people working.</p>
      <p>“I hope people watch enough of The State Of It so we can get to other people in a second season.</p>
      <p>“I’d do this show forever if we keep bringing new people through.</p>
      <p>“People shouldn’t be jumping through hopes, we need to recognise talent and push them.</p>
      <p>“I hope people see this show and realise they could definitely be on it.</p>
      <p>“Watch us, look at the credits and contact the producers and names you see.</p>
      <p>“Anybody who wants to do comedy, particulary women and people from different backgrounds, we need to broaden the diversity out.”</p>
      <p>Away from telly screens, Robert is also dominating the airwaves.</p>
      <p>He recently launched the Wrestling Daft podcast alongside Scot Squad and wrestling star co-host Grado.</p>
      <p>The well known wrestling fan - whose niece Isla Dawn peforms in WWE - couldn’t turn down the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Robert says: “I’ve known Grado for years. He started the football daft podcast which has been going down really well and they said to him about a wrestling and he suggested me as co-presenter.</p>
      <p>“The minute he asked me I said aye. I just love talking about it.”</p>
      <p>The State of It will be on BBC Scotland on Friday November 22 at 10.30pm.</p>
