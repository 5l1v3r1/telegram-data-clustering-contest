      <h1>Protecting Your iPhone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:42:43+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/bob-levitus/" target="_blank">Bob LeVitus</a></address>
      <h3>Dr. Mac’s Rants &amp; Raves<br/>Episode #357</h3>
      <p>I haven’t always been a fan of protective cases for my iPhones. I used to believe that a case—any case—obscured the natural beauty of the iPhone. But after one iPhone got scratched and I cracked the screen of another, I changed my tune.</p>
      <h3>First Line of Defense: Tempered Glass</h3>
      <p>These days my iPhones go into a protective case on day one, but only after I apply a tempered glass screen protector.</p>
      <p>I tried a number of expensive name brand glass screen protectors that came with free replacements. But I soon realized that it was a lot less expensive to buy a multi-pack of off-brand glass protectors at Amazon.com. For example, I recently ordered a three-pack of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B075175151/themacobs-20">JETech Screen Protector Tempered Glass Film</a>, which had a 4.5-star rating and 1,600 reviews, for just $3.98.</p>

        <figcaption>At less than $3 each, glass protectors such as these have saved my bacon countless times.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>So far they work at least as well as more expensive products at a fraction of the price. (Note that the current deal is the same price but for only two protectors… still a bargain in my humble opinion.)</p>
      <h3>Screen Replacement is Expensive</h3>
      <p>With Apple’s screen replacements starting at $129 (for iPhone SE, 5S, or 5C) to a whopping $329 (for iPhone XS Max or 11 Pro Max), I am convinced that my inexpensive glass screen covers have saved me hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars in broken screens. I’ve cracked or broken a handful of these inexpensive protectors, but so far have had no damage whatsoever to my iPhone’s screen.</p>
      <h3>Save Money Tomorrow; Buy AppleCare+ Today</h3>
      <p>But, while glass screen protectors have saved my bacon several times over the years, there is one other precaution I take with all of my iPhones (and other small devices)—AppleCare+. While I don’t get it for my desktop Macs, I do get it for most of my portable Apple products, especially iPhones.</p>
      <p>AppleCare+ is Apple’s insurance plan for its products. You can buy it for your iPhone at any time within the first 60 days for $130–$200 (one-time payment) depending upon your iPhone model.</p>
      <p>The main reason I recommend it is that if you do break your iPhone’s screen, you’ll pay just $29 to have it repaired, instead of the $129–$329 it would cost without AppleCare+.</p>
      <p>And, other repairs are a flat $99 per incident rather than the $149–$599 they’d cost without AppleCare+.</p>
      <p>Finally, if you add the additional loss and theft protection for a one-time payment of $70–$100, you’ll pay only $199–$269 your iPhone is lost or stolen. With iPhones now selling for as much as $1,449, it’s a small price to pay if you are likely to lose or destroy your iPhone.</p>
      <p>So… while I usually recommend against extended warranties, which are often a huge money-maker for the manufacturer, I recommend AppleCare+ for iPhones for all of the reasons above.</p>
      <p>If, on the other hand, you’re careful with your iPhone and don’t ever break or lose them, you could save a small fortune over the years by <i>not </i>buying AppleCare+.</p>
      <p>On the other, other hand (assuming you have three hands), a single accident or theft could cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>
      <p>Which is why I get AppleCare+ for all of my iPhones.</p>
