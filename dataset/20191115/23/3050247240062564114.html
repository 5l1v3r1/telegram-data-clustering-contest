      <p>Despite Bitcoin’s continued struggle to reach higher highs, Tom Lee, renowned Bitcoin bull, co-founder and Wall Street strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tom-lee-like-faang-stocks-btc-will-hit-25k-due-to-network-value">said</a> that he believes that Fundstrat’s $25,000 by 2022 forecast for Bitcoin is still “quite easy to achieve.” He said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Cryptocurrencies are network value assets, meaning the more people hold the asset, the greater the value. In fact, it’s a log function — so if you double the users hold it, you get a quadrupling of value. To go to $25,000 you essentially need a little less than 4x rise, which means you need to double the number of people who hold Bitcoin.”</blockquote>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), meanwhile, is currently sitting at $180 per coin. The number one altcoin has been trading in perfect sync with BTC, showing downward price behavior leading to its current trading position, courtesy of a loss of almost 3% on the day.</p>

      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>, the third-largest coin by market capitalization, is no exception to today’s trend of red candlesticks and has been consistently losing ground in the past few days. The token sits at around $0.261 per coin, down 3.20% on the day at press time.</p>
      <p>According to regular Cointelegraph contributor Rakesh Upadhyay, XRP price is in danger of dropping to the next support at $0.24508. Upadhyay <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-analysis-15-11-btc-eth-xrp-bch-ltc-eos-bnb-bsv-xlm-trx">said</a> that if this support holds, the altcoin will remain range-bound between $0.24508 and $0.31491 for a few more days. However, if the support cracks, a drop to $0.22 is likely.</p>
