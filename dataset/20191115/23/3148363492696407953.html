      <h1>Debra Messing’s ‘Will &amp; Grace’ Ratings Tank to New Low</h1>
      <h2>NBC’s Will &amp; Grace, starring virulent leftist actress Debra Messing, fell to a new ratings low, this week.</h2>

      <p>The low rated reboot’s last season has been sinking like a rock despite reaching for the rafters with a pregnancy plot.</p>
      <p>The Messing-starring sit-com hit a <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/will-and-grace-latin-grammys-thursday-night-football-ratings/">new low</a> among the important 18-49 demographic, according to <i>The Wrap</i>. In its 9:30 time slot, <i>Will &amp; Grace</i> saw only at 0.4/2 and 2.1 million viewers.</p>
      <p>Messing’s show is wallowing on NBC, which was the fifth-rated network of the night. By contrast, CBS’s freshman sitcom, <i>Carol’s Second Act</i>, saw a 0.6/3 and 4.8 million viewers, and ABC’s <i>A Million Little Things</i> received a 0.8/4 and 4.6 million viewers at 9 PM.</p>
      <p>The number one network for the night was Fox, with its <i>Thursday Night Football</i>, which won 3.3 rating/16 share and 11.7 million viewers.</p>
      <p>Debra Messing apparently has been exploring other work. She recently appeared in a stage play mocking president Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>In October, Messing <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/10/23/debra-messing-mocks-trump-in-stage-play-based-on-mueller-report/">appeared</a> at Beverly Hills’ Saban Theatre for a fundraiser organized by former Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA).</p>
      <p>Messing reportedly began the play by reading one of the president’s tweets about her on Sept. 1. President Trump’s tweet was a response to Messing’s controversial call to publicize the names of attendees to his September fundraiser in Beverly Hills.</p>
      <p>Trump slammed Messing for her call to blacklist his supporters, calling her a “bad” actress and “Debra The Mess Messing.” He also referred to Messing’s support of labeling black supporters of President Trump as “mentally ill.”</p>
