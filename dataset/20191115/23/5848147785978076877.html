      <h1>Boxing: Hall and Gallen draw their short ‘code war’ bout</h1>

      <p>Former league star Paul Gallen and ex-AFL player Barry Hall may be set for a rematch after their “Code War” fight in Melbourne ended in a draw.</p>
      <p>Squaring off over six two-minute rounds on Friday, the fight was scored a majority draw.</p>
      <p>One judge at Margaret Court Arena scored Gallen ahead 58-56 while the other two scored the fight 57-57.</p>
      <p>Gallen kept his 10-fight unbeaten record intact while Hall was making his debut in front of a vocal pro-AFL crowd.</p>
      <p>The pair traded some big shots as they searched for a knock-out blow in an even contest with both believing they’d done enough to get the win.</p>
      <p>Gallen said a draw “felt like a loss” and lashed out at the judges.</p>
      <p>“I’m disappointed with a draw,” he said. “One judge had it right and the other two had it wrong.</p>
      <p>“He hit me with some good clean shots and probably won one or two rounds but for me boxing is about who is the aggressor, who lands more shots.</p>
      <p>“Blind Freddy could see I landed more shots and kept coming forward … he was just constantly trying to survive.”</p>
      <p>Gallen, who retired at the end of the NRL season after 19 years, said he was planning a holiday before considering his next boxing move.</p>
      <p>He said it “made sense” to have a rematch.</p>
      <p>“I’m more than happy to do it again … but we will have to get some judges who can score.”</p>
      <p>Hall also thought he had the upperhand and said he landed cleaner shots.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old said he should have trusted trainer Angelo Hyder, who told him that Gallen was “gassed”.</p>
      <p>“Angelo was saying at the end of the fourth, ‘You’ve got him’ and I didn’t go, so it’s my fault.</p>
      <p>“I was trying to conserve energy as I thought he was going to kick in the last round and he didn’t.</p>
      <p>“I probably could have put a bit more pressure on him late, seeing him backing up and breathing quite heavily, I had my opportunity to press him a bit more.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t, but that’s my inexperience.”</p>
      <p>The AFL premiership captain said while he loved the experience, he wouldn’t make a decision on another fight until talking to his family.</p>
