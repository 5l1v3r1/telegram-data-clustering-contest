      <h1>Giants privately almost had their own helmet-swinging fiasco</h1>

      <p>He swung the football helmet in his hand like a weapon at the head of an unprotected player.</p>
      <p>Yes, that’s what Browns defensive lineman Myles Garrett did Thursday night <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-suspended-indefinitely-for-browns-steelers-fight/">to earn an indefinite suspension</a> – no shorter than the final six games of the 2019 season plus playoffs – from the NFL. It’s also what ex-Giant Damon Harrison did in an incident that barely gained any traction in June 2018.</p>
      <p>Garrett connected with the skull of Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph, and video will live on because it happened at the end of a chippy rivalry game in front of a national audience with social media at hand. Outrage immediately poured in questioning <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/could-myles-garrett-face-assault-charges-for-helmet-attack/">whether Garrett would be charged with assault</a>, listing his history of personal foul penalties and looking for a comparison point from modern NFL history.</p>
      <p>But Giants offensive guard Kevin Zeitler, who spent two seasons practicing on the opposite side of the line of scrimmage from Garrett, couldn’t believe his eyes. He was traded by the Browns in March.</p>
      <p>“Very surprised by the whole thing,” Zeitler told The Post. “Myles was a great teammate the two years I was with him. I’ve seen plenty of fights over the years, but I hadn’t seen anything like that. Didn’t expect it to come from Myles.”</p>

      <p>It all makes you wonder what might have happened 17 months ago if not for a matter of inches.</p>
      <p>At the end of a routine running play during the no-video-permitted portion of the last minicamp practice, Harrison emerged from a pile-up holding rookie teammate Will Hernandez’s helmet. He then swung it at Hernandez’s head.</p>
      <p>Harrison just missed connecting with Hernandez, who was still on one knee. Hernandez got to his feet and landed a punch before teammates stepped in to break up the fight. Coach Pat Shurmur removed both players from drills and chewed out a steamed Harrison.</p>
      <p>Unlike Garrett, no video. No contact. No suspension.</p>
      <p>“That wasn’t anything but football,” Harrison unapologetically told The Post a few weeks later, “and if you don’t believe that, then obviously you don’t know the game.”</p>
      <p>It is unknown whether the Giants fined Harrison and/or Hernandez.</p>
      <p>The two somehow managed to let the moment pass and continued to bang bodies on the practice field and to share opposite ends of a locker room without incident until Harrison was traded to the Lions in October 2018. Only recently, when the Giants faced the Lions, did the incident resurface.</p>
      <p>Hernandez told NJ Advance Media he holds “no grudges” toward Harrison, who, with more time to reflect, said he made a “stupid mistake” and admitted he apologized to Hernandez when they still were teammates. There didn’t appear to be any lingering bad blood before or during the game.</p>
      <p>Garrett <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-apologizes-for-mason-rudolph-helmet-attack/">issued an apology of his own</a>, describing his actions as “a terrible mistake … selfish and unacceptable” and accepting responsibility. It is unclear if he will appeal his suspension.</p>
