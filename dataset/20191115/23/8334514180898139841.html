      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Celgene Corp have won U.S. antitrust approval for their merger on condition that they sell Celgene’s psoriasis drug Otezla, the Federal Trade Commission said in a statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>Bristol-Myers Squibb said the decision meant it had all the needed regulatory approvals and would close the acquisition on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Amgen has agreed to buy Celgene’s Otezla business, the company said in a statement. The Otezla sale was valued at $13.4 billion.</p>
      <p>Bristol-Myers Squibb announced in January it would buy Celgene Corp in a cash-and-stock deal for about $74 billion, combining two of the world’s largest cancer drug businesses in the biggest pharmaceutical deal ever.</p>
      <p>The proposed divestiture is the largest that the FTC or the U.S. Department of Justice have ever required in a merger enforcement matter, the FTC said in its statement.</p>
      <p>“The Commission has ordered BMS to divest Otezla to preserve BMS’s incentive to continue developing its own oral product for treating moderate-to-severe psoriasis,” FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The five members of the FTC split along party lines on whether to approve the proposed merger, with the three Republicans in favor and two Democrats opposed.</p>
      <p>Rebecca Slaughter, who voted to oppose the deal, argued that the FTC’s approach of demanding divestitures only if the two companies sell treatments for the same ailment was “too narrow.”</p>
      <p>“The commission should more broadly consider whether any pharmaceutical merger is likely to exacerbate anticompetitive conduct by the merged firm or to hinder innovation,” she said in a dissenting statement.</p>
