      <h1>Researchers develop an AI system with near-perfect seizure prediction</h1>
      <h2>It's 99.6 accurate detecting seizures up to an hour before they happen.</h2>

      <p>We've seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/29/smart-bracelet-warns-of-nighttime-epileptic-seizures/">a smart arm bracelet</a> that can predict nightly seizures, but now a pair of researchers have created something even more promising: an AI system that can predict epileptic seizures with 99.6-percent accuracy. Even better, it can do so up to an hour before they occur. As <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/diagnostics/this-new-ai-system-can-predict-seizures-with-nearperfect-accuracy?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">IEEE Spectrum reports</a>, that gives people enough time to prepare for the attack by taking medication. Around 50 million people around the world currently have epilepsy, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/epilepsy">according to the World Health Organization</a>, and 70 percent of those patients can control their seizures with medication.</p>
      <p>While it's not a complete fix, the new AI system, developed by Hisham Daoud and Magdy Bayoumi of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, is a major leap forward from existing prediction methods. Currently, other methods analyze brain activity with an EEG (electroencephalogram) test and apply a predictive model afterwards. The new method does both of those things at once, with the help of a deep learning algorithm that maps brain activity and another that can predict the electrical channels lighting up during a seizure.</p>
      <p>It'll still be some time before this technique will be available for widespread use -- the team is now working on a custom chip that can help process the necessary algorithms -- but it could be life-changing news for patients with epilepsy.</p>
