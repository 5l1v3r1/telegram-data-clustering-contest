      <h1>Slate's spice kitchen keeps focus on the dining experience</h1>

      <p>While an open-concept kitchen is ideal for entertaining, sometimes the aroma from a meal and mess created preparing it is better off tucked away.</p>
      <p>This is where the addition of a spice kitchen can make a difference.</p>
      <p>In a new show home by Mattamy Homes in the northeast master-planned community of Cityscape, this enclosed secondary kitchen is on display. The Slate is a three-bedroom, 2,282-square-foot, front-drive single-family home with a Colonial elevation.</p>
      <p>Just off the conventional kitchen, which is grand and in an L-shaped design, the show home demonstrates this model’s optional spice kitchen. It has an oven, sink, and floating shelves, perfect for keeping the domestic chef’s favourite herbs and spices in easy reach.</p>
      <p>When putting together a feast for a special occasion, the spice kitchen can also function as a supplementary cooking space, shouldering a portion of the load.</p>
      <p>With an eye-catching full-height backsplash, abundance of cabinets, and stainless steel appliances including a wall oven, the primary kitchen is both functional and striking. Its large central island has built-in shelves and a rounded end that seats four people, easily doubling as a table for a casual meal or snack.</p>
      <p>With considerable space between the island and kitchen features along its walls, it’s convenient to circulate, and make dinner preparation a team effort.</p>
      <p>Both the kitchen and adjacent great room — which features a stylish elongated fireplace flanked by built-in shelves — are highlighted by well-sized rear-facing windows.</p>
      <p>The dining area has three walls, giving dinnertime a more formal feeling.</p>

      <p>This show home also presents the floor plan’s optional side door entry, which provides direct access to the basement.</p>
      <p>The basement can be developed — with an additional bedroom and rec area — and used for either extended family or a rental tenant to offset mortgage payments. In this case, the side entry allows the person who lives in the basement to access the home without walking through the more personal ends of the main floor.</p>
      <p>On the second floor, its central 16-foot by 12-foot two inch bonus room creates a winged effect, with the master bedroom and its accessory spaces along the back wall and two secondary bedrooms facing the front.</p>
      <p>The master ensuite feels like a high-end spa. Luxurious vessel sinks sit under a full-width mirror and a deep soaker tub is surrounded in elegant full-height tile.</p>
      <p>All three bedrooms have a walk-in closet. The secondary bedrooms are similar in size and stand side-by-side.</p>
      <p>The laundry room is spacious, with a front-load washer and dryer, counter for folding clothes, and cabinets, handy for storing detergent, bleach, and fabric softener.</p>
      <p>Cityscape, Mattamy’s first community within Calgary limits, features a 46.5-hectare environmental reserve and direct access to the Rotary/Mattamy Greenway, which will connect 55 neighbourhoods in a 138-kilometre loop around the city, making it the largest urban system in the world.</p>
