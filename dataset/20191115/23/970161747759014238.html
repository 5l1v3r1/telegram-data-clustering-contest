      <p>An alleged serial rapist held a string of victims prisoner, including children as young as 11, over a three-day attack, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Joseph McCann, 34, allegedly abducted and raped a victims aged 11 to 71 across London, Hertfordshire and the North West.</p>
      <p>McCann has pleaded not guilty to all 37 charges against him relating to 11 victims – one of which claimed she only managed to get away when she hit him over the head with a vodka bottle.</p>
      <p>The Old Bailey heard how McCann held his first victim, aged 21, at knifepoint after she left Pryzm nightclub in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/watford-fc/">Watford</a>, Hertfordshire.</p>
      <p>In the early hours of April 21, jurors were told how she was forced into a Ford Mondeo, taken home and raped in her own bed, said prosecutor John Price QC.</p>
      <p>Just after midnight on April 25, McCann allegedly struck in Walthamstow, east London, kidnapping a 25-year-old woman as she walked home from work.</p>

      <p>It was heard how the woman was raped ‘many times’ over the next 14 hours and subjected to acts of ‘shocking depravity and violence’.</p>
      <p>Mr Price went on: ‘He hit her and threatened to smash a vodka bottle in her face. Very many sexual assaults upon her took place in various locations, in and out of the car.</p>
      <p>‘He made her call him “daddy” and say that she was a child.</p>
      <p>‘At one point the man parked the car near to a school, saying that he wanted to make her rape a child. He raped (the woman) at that location.’</p>
      <p>Just after midday on the same day, McCann allegedly abducted a 21-year-old woman in Edgware, north London, while still holding the 25-year-old prisoner.</p>

      <p>Jurors were shown CCTV footage of the woman being bundled into a silver Ford S Max car while her younger sister, who had been with her, got away.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old was not only raped but also forced to engage in sexual activity with the terrified 25-year-old during their harrowing ordeal, jurors heard.</p>

      <p>Afterwards, he allegedly abducted a 71-year-old woman at a Morrison’s car park in Bury.</p>
      <p>The woman had just loaded her shopping in the boot and was about to drive off when McCann jumped into her Fiat car, punched her in the face and ordered her to drive, it was claimed.</p>
      <p>He raped the pensioner and went on to kidnap and sexually assault a 13-year-old girl before both managed to escape at Knutsford Service Station on the M6, the court heard.</p>
