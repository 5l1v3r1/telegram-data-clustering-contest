      <p>RIYADH: Artist and creator Yoichi Takahashi walked onto the stage at the Anime Expo to warm cheers on Friday as fans welcomed Thursday’s announcement of the upcoming “Captain Tsubasa” remake.<br/>“Happy to be here with this large crowd. Maybe it’s too short a time, but I hope we’ll all enjoy it together,” he told his Saudi fans.<br/>Takahashi’s football-focused anime “Captain Tsubasa” is held in high regard in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia.<br/>Three quarters of Arabs surveyed in a recent Arab News / YouGov poll said it was their favorite anime.<br/>Anime Expo marks the manga artist’s first visit to Saudi Arabia. “I heard there are many fans here — I’m truly happy to be here,” he said.<br/>Takahashi revealed that he was initially working on a different story while watching the FIFA World Cup, which inspired him to focus instead on “Captain Tsubasa.”<br/>The remake will air on MBC on Dec. 1 under an agreement signed between Takahashi and the General Entertainment Authority.<br/>“In Japan, the remake aired last year. I’m honored to see it will air so soon in Saudi Arabia,” he said.<br/>The message behind “Captain Tsubasa” is about making dreams a reality, he added, “and I hope we all make our dreams come true.”<br/>Next year will mark the 40th anniversary of the anime’s creation, but Takahashi is by no means finished with the franchise. “Tsubasa+,” a smartphone game, will be released in 2020.<br/>“Globally, people will be able to play and enjoy ‘Captain Tsubasa,’ not just watch it,” he said.<br/>Ending his talk with a bang, Takahashi announced that he was giving five signed illustrations of “Captain Tsubasa” to lucky winners.<br/>He played “rock, paper, scissors” with the crowd to pick the winners: Four young men and a woman.</p>
