      <p>A coalition of 20 transit watchdog groups demanded Friday the MTA swiftly appoint the powerful toll board for Manhattan’s new congestion pricing program and require that it comply state transparency laws.</p>
      <p>The letter to MTA officials about the Traffic Mobility Review Board comes as <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/cuomo-racks-up-campaign-cash-as-state-considers-donor-limit/">another state panel</a> — the Public Campaign Financing Commission — comes under fire for deliberating behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>The letter says the TMRB clearly falls under New York’s Open Meetings law.</p>
      <p>“In sum, we urge you to immediately appoint the TMRB, and ensure that the body follows the Open Meetings Law. The public interest is best served when the public can understand the reasoning behind government decision-making,” the letter from the coalition said.</p>
      <p>The letter was signed by 20 groups including Reinvent Albany, the Regional Plan Association, Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA (PCAC), Citizens Budget Commission, Riders Alliance, NYPRG’s Straphangers Campaign and the TransitCenter.</p>
      <p>“The process of establishing the Traffic Mobility Review Board (TMRB) is moving forward, and members will be appointed as required by statute,” responded MTA spokesman Chris McKniff, adding that the program is “an historic opportunity to reduce congestion, raise funds for mass transit, improve air quality, and provide a better quality of life for all New Yorkers, that we must get right.”</p>
      <p>Congestion pricing is expected to generate $15B to help pay for the $51.5 billion in subway, bus and railroad construction projects proposed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority over the next five years.</p>
      <p>Drivers will be charged a yet-to-be-determined toll to enter the new congestion zone, which will cover Manhattan south of 60th Street.</p>
      <p>State lawmakers legally <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/02/politicians-put-off-setting-congestion-pricing-fee-until-after-2020-election/">prohibited the board</a> from releasing its toll pricing recommendations until after the 2020 election to avoid a possible backlash from outerborough and suburban drivers at the ballot box.</p>
      <p>The Post broke the story in April exposing the provision, which bars the panel from producing its report until 12 days after the Nov. 3, 2020, election.</p>
      <p>The toll was set at $11.52 in a previous plan. Aside from setting the fee, the board members will have the power to establish hardship exemptions from the toll and allow for bridge and tunnel tolls to be rebated.</p>
      <p>Responded MTA spokesman Chris McKniff, “The process of establishing the Traffic Mobility Review Board (TMRB) is moving forward, and members will be appointed as required by statute.</p>
      <p>“Central Business District Tolling provides us with an historic opportunity to reduce congestion, raise funds for mass transit, improve air quality, and provide a better quality of life for all New Yorkers, that we must get right.</p>
      <p>“We are committed to being transparent and will work with local communities, elected officials and advocates to inform on our progress.”</p>
