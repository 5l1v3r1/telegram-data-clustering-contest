      <h1>Hardcore Ford Raptor Rival Is In A League Of Its Own</h1>
      <h2>Glickenhaus and company are taking this beast to Baja, and will sell you one, too.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:45:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Joseph</a></address>
      <p>Think the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/f-150-raptor">Ford F-150 Raptor</a> is a pretty badass dune-jumper? Well it is. But the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-modern-baja-boot-off-roader-looks-bonkers">SCG Boot</a> is in another league entirely. Like Score International, the body that sanctions the Baja 1000. That's where it'll be competing next week. But this is the version you can not only buy but actually drive on public streets.</p>
      <p>The Boot is the latest vehicle to come from Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus, the racing constructor started by financier, Hollywood producer, and noted <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/pininfarina-s-ferrari-modulo-hits-the-road-for-the-first-time">Ferrari collector</a> James Glickenhaus. But where most of SCG's vehicles have been designed for the tarmac (where this one can legally be driven as well), the Boot is an off-roader, first and foremost.</p>

      <p>The SCG Boot is modeled after the Baja Boot made famous by the legendary late actor/racer Steve McQueen, who drove one in the late '60s. But Glickenhaus' modern version takes the form even further. It packs GM's 6.2-liter LT1 small-block V8 from the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/camaro">Chevy Camaro SS</a>, turned around, mounted amidships and sending 460 horsepower through a four-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels. And those 17-inch wheels are wrapped in BFGoodrich off-road tires and heavily articulated with 19 inches of travel. But that's just the road-going version. The competition-spec model that SCG will field in Baja has an extra three inches of suspension travel and an even wider track.</p>

      <p>Best of all, the racing Boot packs the 650-horsepower supercharged LT4 V8 from the outgoing <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette-z06">Corvette Z06</a>. That's a heck of a lot more than the 450 hp in McQueen's Baja Boot half a century ago. That's progress for ya. And we wouldn't be at all surprised to find SCG has squeezed even more out of it. But however much muscle it's packing, we're looking forward to seeing how it fares in competition.</p>
      <p>As for the road-going customer Boot, it sure ain't pretty, but we'd jump at the opportunity to drive one â€“ on the road, or better yet, off it.</p>
