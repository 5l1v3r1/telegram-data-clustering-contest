      <p>The incident involving the Russian citizen is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the CBP Use of Force Incident Team, the release concluded.</p>
      <p>"The only other information that we would have is that it is a male subject", CBP's Press Officer Robert Daniels said, adding that the man had proof of Russian citizenship. "That would all be part of an investigation".</p>
      <p>DanielsÂ explained that there will be a "combination of interviews with Customs and Border Protection and the FBI", but noted that any information obtained during the interviews will not be released.</p>
