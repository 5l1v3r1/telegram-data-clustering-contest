      <p>BOE is the manufacturer of Motorola’s RAZR and Thinkpad X1 foldable displays<br/>3.7 (74.74%) 19 votes</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Lenovo took the wraps off the highly-anticipated<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/the-foldable-motorola-razr-with-6-2-inch-oled-219-cinemavision-display-is-official/"> Motorola RAZR in the United States</a>. Today, the company expanded the device’s availability to the Chinese stronghold. The Chinese launch happened today during Tech World 2019 in China. Lenovo took the opportunity to reveal the world’s first PC with foldable displays. That’s exactly the same Thinkpad X1 that came earlier this year. Besides Lenovo’s launches, we got a big revelation from BOE.</p>
      <p>Wei Wei, the vice-president of BOE group, <a href="https://tech.sina.com.cn/mobile/n/n/2019-11-15/doc-iihnzahi1097754.shtml">revealed via a Weibo’s post that the folding displays for the Thinkpad X1 line and Motorola Razr were made by BOE</a>. Interestingly enough, those aren’t the first devices to feature a BOE folding display. Huawei Mate X joins the list of devices featuring BOE’s foldable displays.</p>

      <p>This is pretty interesting, after all, it means that BOE is ready for supplying foldable displays. Thus allowing any company to launch a foldable smartphone in the next year. After all, not every company can manufacture its own foldable display solution like Samsung. With the advent of BOE foldable displays, we expect to see the foldable segment winning bigger traction in the next year.</p>
      <p>The Motorola’s RAZR is the third commercial available smartphone to ship with a foldable display. It will face special competition in China where Samsung has already released the Galaxy Fold and Huawei has the Mate X.</p>
