      <h1>China's H-20 Stealth Bomber: The One Weapon America Won't Be Able to Beat?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Sebastien Roblin</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>American military superiority is rapidly being reduced.</p>
      <p>In October 2018, Chinese media announced that the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) would publicly unveil its new H-20 stealth bomber during a parade celebrating the air arm’s seventieth anniversary in 2019.</p>
      <p>Prior news of the H-20’s development had been teased using techniques pioneered by viral marketing campaigns for Hollywood movies. For example, the Xi’an Aviation Industrial Corporation released a<a href="http://defenseimg.81.cn/data/static/2018/05/08/1168_9687.html"> promotional video</a> in May 2018 pointedly imitating Northrop Grumman’s own<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW_hIUpJ8h8"> Superbowl ad</a> for the B-21 stealth bomber, portraying a shrouded flying wing bomber in its final seconds. Later, the silhouette of a possible new bomber appeared at a PLAAF gala. This comes only two years after PLAAF Gen. Ma Xiaotian formally revealed the Hong-20’s existence.</p>
      <p>If the H-20 does have the range and passable stealth characteristics attributed to it, it could alter the strategic calculus between the United States and China by exposing U.S. bases and fleets across the Pacific to surprise air attacks.</p>
      <p>Only three countries have both the imperative and the resources to develop huge strategic bombers that can strike targets across the globe: the United States, Russia and China. Strategic bombers make sense for China because Beijing perceives dominance of the western half of the Pacific Ocean as essential for its security due to its history of<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-opium-wars-the-bloody-conflicts-destroyed-imperial-china-17212"> maritime invasion</a>, and the challenge posed by the United States in particular. The two superpowers are separated by five to six thousand miles of ocean—and the United States has spent the last century developing a network of island territories such as Guam, foreign military bases in East Asia and<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/step-aboard-nimitz-class-aircraft-carrier-reason-why-us-navy-unstoppable-25356"> super-carriers</a> with which it can project air and sea power across that span.</p>
