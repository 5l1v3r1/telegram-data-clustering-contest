      <p>HOUSTON (CNN/Gray News) - These shampoo bottles may look innocent enough, but 35 lbs of liquid cocaine valued at more than $400,000 was hidden inside them.</p>
      <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers seized them from the checked luggage of a passenger at George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Monday.</p>
      <p>The agency said the would-be smuggler was a 26-year-old Colombia citizen. Agents questioned the man as he got his bags from a luggage carousel.</p>
      <p>After questioning him, they searched his bags and a K-9 alerted them to the dozens of shampoo bottles. CBP said a test later confirmed the substance inside the bottles was cocaine.</p>
      <p>The man returned to Colombia, and CBP turned the cocaine over to Houston police.</p>
      <p>A CBP spokeswoman told USA Today that the man was not arrested or charged because the agency only presents cases, it does not file charges.</p>
      <p>She said that's the job of local law enforcement or the Justice Department.</p>
