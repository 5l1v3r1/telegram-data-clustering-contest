      <h1>Ken Starr: Impeachment inquiry 'coup d'etat' by House Democrats; stark contrast to Watergate</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">Democrats'</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> is essentially a "coup d'etat in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress">House of Representatives</a>," former independent counsel <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ken-starr-impeachment-inquiry-john-dean-trump-hearings">Ken Starr</a> said Saturday.</p>
      <p>The probe to date is "far removed" from the drama of the Watergate scandal, Starr said on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Fox &amp; Friends: Weekend."</a> Also appearing on the show was a member of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> legal team, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/jordan-sekulow">Jordan Sekulow</a>.</p>
      <p>In the Democrats' current investigation, there has been nothing to match the spellbinding testimony of John Dean, the former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">White House</a> counsel for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/1969-richard-nixon-37th-president">President Richard Nixon</a>.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>"Here's John Dean testifying dramatically: 'I'm in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">Oval Office</a> and I am participating in a criminal conspiracy with the president of the United States,'" said Starr, who headed the Whitewater investigation into allegations against President Clinton.  "Here we have a witness who does not have a connection to the president ... and knows of no crime. So it's really night and day."</p>
      <p>On Friday, former U.S. Ambassador to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukraine</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/the-impeachment-hearing-witnesses-who-is-marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a> testified publicly before the House Intelligence Committee for six hours. But Yovanovitch told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/utah">Utah</a> Republican <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/marie-yovanovitch-president-trump-impeachment-hearing">Rep. Chris Stewart</a> that she could supply the panel with no information regarding criminal activity or bribes that the president may have been involved with.</p>
      <p>Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who heads the committee, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, D-Calif., initiated the probe after a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/icig-complaint-ukraine-whistleblower">whistleblower complaint</a> to the intelligence community inspector general alleged wrongdoing stemming from the president's July 25 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-ukraine-call-transcript-read-the-document">phone call</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy. Trump is accused of leveraging aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on a political rival, an alleged quid pro quo the president has denied.</p>
      <p>Public hearings began Wednesday after the House <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/who-broke-ranks-on-impeachment-resolution-vote">voted to approve a resolution</a> formalizing the impeachement inquiry. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/republicans">Republicans</a> had been calling for transparency in the Democrat-led process for weeks, eventually <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmakers-in-blasting-secret-impeachment-probe-before-attempting-to-storm-the-proceedings">storming a closed-door deposition</a> in a secure room.</p>

      <p>"This goes back to the entire process point," Starr said. "And, I must say, when you depart from tradition you may be doing the right thing, you may be reforming, or you may be really fouling up."</p>
      <p>"And so, the Democrats decided to depart radically from tradition and to make Chairman Schiff the new head of the Judiciary Committee," he told "Fox &amp; Friends" host Pete Hegseth.</p>
      <p>"There has essentially been a coup d'etat in the House of Representatives. And so, when we look at each procedure, we see some departure from the past," Starr stated.</p>
