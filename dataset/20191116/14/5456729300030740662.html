      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:14:51+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/363515-reps-summon-chief-of-air-staff-over-helicopter-crash.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The House of Representatives Committee on Air Force says that Chief of Air Staff Sadique Abubakar should appear and explain the factors that lead to the crash of a training helicopter in Enugu.</p>
      <p>The committee gave the directive in a statement issued by the Chairman, Shehu Koko (APC-Kebbi) on Saturday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Mr Koko said the House had the determination to investigate the remote cause of the ugly incident to avoid future recurrence.</p>
      <p>The chairman gave thanks to God that no life was lost in the accident which occurred as the helicopter was returning from a routine exercise.</p>
      <p>“As members of parliament, particularly the House of Representatives Committee on Air Force, we are disturbed that such incident occurred.</p>
      <p>“Especially at a time when the Air Force had assured the parliament and the nation that the force was fully prepared to take on insecurity head-on.</p>
      <p>“The committee which has pledged its full support to the force is deeply saddened about this unfortunate situation.</p>
      <p>“We, therefore, invite the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, to brief the committee on the immediate and remote causes of the crash.</p>
      <p>“The date for the interface shall be communicated through the secretariat in due course,” he said.</p>
