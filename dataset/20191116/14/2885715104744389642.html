      <p>The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) Friday suspended the flying license of two IndiGo airlines pilots for three months, from November 15, in connection with a runway incursion incident at the Chennai airport, reported ANI.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on July 14, 2019, when the air traffic control had asked the pilots of the flight 6E-244 to hold the Airbus A320 at the runway holding point, but the pilots crossed it, which lead to the runway incursion.</p>
      <p>The aviation watchdog said the pilot-in-command accepted his mistake, following which it suspended the license of both the pilots.</p>
      <p>The aviation regulatory body investigated the incident and issued showcause notices to the pilots “to explain in writing as to why action should not be taken against (them) for endangering the safety of aircraft and passengers on board”.</p>
      <p>The notice added, “…investigation has revealed crew did not adhere to (ATC) instruction to hold at runway holding point… the crew failed to contact tower frequency even though it was changed over to tower frequency by (surface movement) controller… The (pilots) accepted (their) lapse… crossed the holding point”.</p>
      <p>“This is in violation of DGCA advisory circular which states that flight crews should use a ‘continuous loop’ process for actively monitoring and updating their progress and location during taxi. This includes knowing the aircraft’s present location and mentally calculating the next location on the route that will require increased attention. The above action of the crew jeopardised the safety of the aircraft and passengers,” the order adds.</p>
