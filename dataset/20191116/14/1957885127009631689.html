      <p><b>News</b> by Wesley Yin-Poole, Deputy Editor Updated on 16 November 2019</p>
      <p>Grinding Gear Games has announced Path of Exile Mobile.</p>
      <p>The announcement video, below, is clearly mindful of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-03-blizzard-faces-backlash-after-blizzcon-diablo-mobile-announcement">Blizzard's disastrous announcement of Diablo Immortal</a> - and even has a little fun with it.</p>

      <p>Grinding Gear's video begins with technical director and co-founder Jonathan Rodgers saying there's a lot of "garbage" in mobile games today, but he points out that it was a similar sentiment about PC free-to-play when the studio launched action role-playing game Path of Exile back in 2013.</p>
      <p>We then hear from Grinding Gear's Trevor Gamon, who is described as the "mobile fall guy".</p>
      <p>And then a quote from Chris Wilson, co-founder and managing director: "We wanted to make something that is a real Path of Exile game. We didn't just farm it out to an external studio. It's developed entirely by our team here in New Zealand."</p>
      <p>Blizzard came under fire when it announced Diablo for mobile devices at BlizzCon 2018 in part because of an expectation from fans that the company would announce Diablo 4 instead (Diablo 4 ended up being announced at BlizzCon 2019).</p>
      <p>Diablo Immortal is co-developed by Blizzard and Chinese company NetEase, which was another point of controversy surrounding the title (some accused the game of being a "reskin" of another NetEase mobile game called Crusaders of Light). Grinding Gears makes it clear in the video Path of Exile Mobile is developed entirely in-house.</p>
      <p>And then we have Trevor Gamon described as the "mobile fall guy". When Blizzard announced Diablo Immortal, it sent developers on-stage to face questions from the community. It did not go well.</p>

      <p>The difference here, of course, is Grinding Gear announced Path of Exile Mobile in the same breath as it revealed Path of Exile 2 and continued support for Path of Exile 1. And then there's the tone of Grinding Gear's announcement video, which almost comes across as satire.</p>
