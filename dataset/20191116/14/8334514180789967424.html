      <p>Parades in many cities were marked by a large police presence, after scuffles between groups who see “Black Pete” as racist and those who cherish the character as a fun holiday tradition led to arrests last year.</p>
      <p>Usually portrayed by white people in black face paint wearing frizzy wigs and prominent red lipstick, Black Pete has sparked intense discussion — and sometimes violent clashes — in recent years.</p>
      <p>Campaigners against racism say exposure to such imagery is hurtful to black people and damaging to children. But a shrinking majority of Dutch people say there is no reason to change what they see as a harmless tradition.</p>
      <p>A pageant in the city of Apeldoorn depicting the arrival of St Nicholas was broadcast on national television.</p>
      <p>Edwin Wagensveld, leader of the Dutch wing of the anti-Muslim PEGIDA movement, was arrested in Apeldoorn by police after refusing to go to an area designated for demonstrations. He was dressed as Black Pete.</p>
      <p>The United Nations has repeatedly called for any racist features to be eradicated from the pre-Christmas festivities but the Dutch government has so far declined to take a stance.</p>
      <p>Last week, police arrested four people in The Hague after they stormed a building where anti-Black Pete activists were gathered, smashing windows and throwing fireworks in an apparent attempt to intimidate them.</p>
      <p>The “Kick Out Black Pete” movement canceled several events throughout the country after the incident, but still held protests in six cities, including The Hague and Groningen, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The rally in The Hague attracted a few hundred protesters, holding “Black Pete is racism” signs and chanting “The Netherlands should be ashamed”.</p>
      <p>In Dutch folklore, St. Nicholas travels once a year from Spain on a steamboat laden with presents. The appearance of his sidekick derives from a 19th century story by children’s author Jan Schenkman that was illustrated with pictures of a dark-skinned Spanish Moor.</p>
      <p>A recent opinion poll showed 59% of all Dutch wanted to keep “Zwarte Piet” in blackface, while 26% said the tradition needed to be changed gradually. In 2011, when the protests started, only 7% of the Dutch said Pete should change.</p>
      <p>Since then, major cities such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam and the national public broadcaster have decided to ditch blackface in favor of Petes smeared with soot — from the chimneys they are said to go down to bring children their presents.</p>
      <p>About 15% of the 17.3 million population of the Netherlands, which was for centuries a major colonial power, are from ethnic minorities.</p>
