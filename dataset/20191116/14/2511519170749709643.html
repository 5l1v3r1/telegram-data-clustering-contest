      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/NicolasCage">Nicolas Cage</a> is reportedly in talks to play himself in a film about him trying to land a role in a new Quentin Tarantino movie.</p>
      <p>The meta-sounding film, titled <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent">Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</a></i>, is undergoing final negotiations to be picked up by Lionsgate, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nicolas-cage-star-as-nicolas-cage-unbearable-weight-massive-talent-1254626"><i>The Hollywood Reporter.</i></a></p>
      <p>It was written by Tom Gormican (<i>That Awkward Moment</i>) and Kevin Etten (<i>Ghosted</i>), with Gormican attached to direct.</p>
      <p>In the film, Cage apparently talks to an egotistical Nineties version of himself, who mocks his future self for not being famous, as well as for making too many low-budget films.</p>
      <p>Cage’s character is also trying to deal with a considerable level of debt, so he agrees to make an appearance at the birthday party of a Mexican drug cartel member (a fan), who wants Cage to see a film script he’s written.</p>
      <p>During all this, Cage also has to try and keep his teenage daughter happy.</p>
      <p>There is currently no indication as to whether other actors are being considering for the role of Nicolas Cage, other than Nicolas Cage himself</p>
