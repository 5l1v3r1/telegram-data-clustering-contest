      <h1>Kumaraswamy taunts Congress for talks with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra</h1>

      <p>As the Maharashtra deadlock on a possible Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress alliance continues, it has given a handle to the Janata Dal (Secular) to taunt the Congress in the run-up to the bypolls in the State.</p>
      <p>In Hunsur, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Saturday came down on the Congress and said it had no moral right to accuse the JD(S) of lacking in ideology given the situation in Maharashtra. Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah had stated that the JD(S) lacked ideology and had no stance in elections.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kumaraswamy asked what moral high ground Mr. Siddaramaiah would take now that his party was talking of an alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. “Siddaramaiah used to make a hue and cry about the communal nature of the BJP’s politics. But the Congress, in its quest for power, is talking to Shiv Sena, which espouses hardcore Hindutva,” he said.</p>
      <p>“While the BJP is known to pursue soft Hindutva, the Shiv Sena is notorious for hardcore Hindutva. And the Congress has joined hands with it,” said Mr. Kumaraswamy. He also sarcastically remarked that instead of cobbling up a three-party alliance to ensure a majority in Maharashtra, the Congress might as well have opted for a two-party alliance by striking a deal with the BJP to come to power. All parties are engaged in politics of opportunism for their survival, and before criticising the JD(S) the Congress should have an introspection, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kumaraswamy also said the JD(S) will not ally with any party in the byelections and has taken the challenge seriously in a bid to defeat all 15 disqualified MLAs.</p>
      <p>Later in the day, the party candidate, Somashekar, filed his nomination papers for the bypolls, scheduled for December 5.</p>
