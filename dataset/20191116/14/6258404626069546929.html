      <p>We're used to seeing small form factor PCs powered by Intel processors -- in the past week we've seen new <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/intel-frost-canyon-nuc-comet-lake-u">Intel Frost Canyon NUCs</a> and an <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/msi-launches-cubi-5-mini-10-pc-intel-comet-lake-u">entry from MSI</a> -- but there hasn't been much action on the AMD side of things. SimplyNUC, however, is giving AMD some lovin' with the release its new Sequoia mini PC family. </p>
      <p>Powering Sequoia are 4-core/8-thread <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/ryzen">Ryzen</a> embedded processors built on AMD's first-generation 14nm Zen architecture. The entry-level system is the Sequoia V6, which is powered by a Ryzen V1605B APU (2GHz base clock, 3.2GHz boost clock) with a 15W TDP and Radeon Vega 8 graphics onboard (1.1GHz GPU clock). The Sequoia V8 adopts a Ryzen V1807B APU (3.3GHz base clock, 3.8GHz boost clock) with a 45W TDP and <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/radeon">Radeon</a> Vega 11 graphics (1.3GHz GPU clock). </p>

      <p>Both systems come with 4GB of DDR4 memory installed (32GB maximum) and a 128GB SSD. Onboard you'll find handful of USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports, two Intel GbE ports, two Mini DisplayPort connections, old-school Serial RS-232/RS-485 connectors, [optional] microSD slot, along with Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0. A 4G LTE cellular modem is also offered as an option.</p>
      <p>Whereas devices like NUCs typically end up in the hands of end-users, Sequoia is aimed squarely at the commercial market. SimplyNUC says that Sequoia can be used for digital signage, industrial applications, and on-site data analysis. The Sequoia has also been designed to operate in harsh environments, which is especially noteworthy for industrial and digital signage usage scenarios. The Sequoia family was designed to withstand temperatures ranging from 0 to 60 degrees C and up to 95 percent relative humidity at 40C.</p>
      <p>The Sequoia V6 is <a href="https://simplynuc.com/sequoia/">available to purchase now</a> priced from $689, while the Sequoia V8 starts at $849. According to the company, it will make the Sequoias available for purchase for up to 7 years from November 2019.</p>
