      <p>A video of migratory bird deaths:</p>
      <p>Thousands of migratory birds of about ten species were found dead around Sambhar Lake, the country’s largest inland saltwater lake near Jaipur, sending shock waves among locals and authorities.</p>
      <p>Officials said they suspect water contamination as one of the reasons for the deaths but were awaiting viscera test reports. Though the official toll was 1,500, locals claimed the number of dead birds could be as high as 5,000.</p>
      <p>A preliminary forensic report has indicated that the mysterious death of more than 4,800 migratory birds at the country’s largest inland water saltwater lake near Jaipur was caused by botulism, a serious and fatal illness that affects the nerves, officials said on Friday.</p>
