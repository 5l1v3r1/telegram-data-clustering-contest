      <p>Ulster Rugby’s two big summer signing look like spending a significant chunk of the season on the sidelines after a double whammy of injuries forced the pair off the pitch during their side’s clash with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> Rugby in the Heineken Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>Neither former Wallaby <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/brumbies/players/sam-carter/">Sam Carter</a> nor <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> loosehead <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/jack-mcgrath/">Jack McGrath</a> made it through a brutal first half of rugby at The Rec.</p>

      <p>First to go was McGrath who was forced to trudge off just 8 minutes into the first half. He appeared to be clutching his wrist.</p>
      <p>Carter looked in serious discomfort following an incident in the 24th minute. The Wallaby then left the field with his arm in a makeshift team, suggesting a possible shoulder injury.</p>

      <p>Alongside <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/highlanders">Highlanders</a> star <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/highlanders/players/matt-faddes/">Matt Faddes</a> – McGrath and Carter were Ulster Rugby’s three big-ticket signings heading into the season.</p>
      <p>The son of former Wallaby David Carter, Sam attended The Scots College in Sydney, before going on to represent Sydney University.</p>
      <p>He made his debut for the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/brumbies">Brumbies</a> in 2011, against the Melbourne Rebels, and in 2018 he became just the twelfth player to make 100 appearances for the club. To date, he has earned 105 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> caps.</p>
      <p>In February 2017, Carter was named as Brumbies co-captain alongside Christian Leali’ifano, who himself enjoyed a successful four-month stint at Ulster last season, and they have jointly led the side over the past two <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> campaigns.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old made his Test debut against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> in June 2014 and has earned 16 caps in total.</p>
      <p>McGrath was first capped for Ireland in 2013 against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/samoa">Samoa</a> and has won 54 caps for Ireland to date and featured in all three Tests on the 2017 British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> Tour of New Zealand. He is a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> winner with Ireland in 2014, 2015 and 2018.</p>
      <p>He made his debut for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster">Leinster</a> in 2010 against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> Warriors and has made over 140 appearances for the Province, winning three Heineken European Cups, an Amlin Challenge Cup, a Guinness PRO14 title and two PRO12 titles.</p>
