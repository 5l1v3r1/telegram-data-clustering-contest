      <p><b>DES MOINES, IowaÂ (AP)</b> - The family of Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Mark Cady says he has died of a heart attack at age 66.</p>
      <p>Cady's family says in a statement posted on the court's website that he died unexpectedly on Friday. In the statement, the Iowa Judicial Branch statement says Cady's "passing is a great loss to the court and the state he so loyally served." A spokesman says Cady was in Des Moines when he died.</p>
      <p>Cady, of Ft. Dodge, was appointed to the Iowa Supreme Court in 1998 and named chief justice in 2011.</p>
      <p>He was a key vote in decisions that rankled social conservatives. Cady wrote the 2009 unanimous opinion that made Iowa the third state to permit same-sex marriages and he wrote last year's decision upholding a woman's right to an abortion under the Iowa Constitution.</p>
