      <h2>Anas Sarwar has called for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to be placed into 'special measures' after Milly Main's mum says she caught a lethal bug from dirty water while in hospital.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:54:33+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/daniel-morrow/</a></address>
      <p>A Labour MSP has called for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">NHS</a> Greater Glasgow and Clyde to be placed into "special measures" as he believes that it is “not fit for purpose”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/anas-sarwar">Anas Sarwar</a> made the allegation after the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/">Daily Record</a> 10-year-old Milly Main's mum says she died after contracting a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">dirty water infection</a> at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queen-elizabeth-university-hospital">Queen Elizabeth University Hospital</a> in 2017.</p>
      <p>Kimberly Darroch says her little girl caught a lethal bug when she was in remission for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cancer">cancer</a> and was preparing herself to return to the family home.</p>

      <p>A number of other young people have been reportedly been infected by the water supply in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> hospital campus, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC)</p>
      <p>A report released earlier this year revealed that 23 children with cancer has acquired infections linked to the water supply in the two wards at RHC.</p>
      <p>The bacteria stenotrophomonas, which is found in water, was linked to 12 of the cases.</p>
      <p>However, as revealed by the Daily Record, a whistleblower approached Labour MSP Anas Sarwar and alleged that an internal doctor-led inquiry focusing on 2017 found another 26 cases.</p>
      <p>The insider said the probe - never published - claimed that a stenotrophomonas infection had to be considered as the cause of death in one of the 26 children.</p>

      <p>Now the MSP for Glasgow has accused the hospital of an “attempted cover up” over her death.</p>
      <p>He said: “The Glasgow health board has unforgivably let down patients and staff.</p>
      <p>“There was an attempted cover-up of Milly’s death, and there are still dozens of families who don’t know the truth about infections contracted in the QUEH.</p>
      <p>“This only came to light following the brave actions of an NHS whistleblower.</p>
      <p>“But rather than seek answers for patients and the public, the health board has resorted to attacking the whistleblower, threatening and intimidating them.</p>

      <p>“This is a clear attempt to silence staff from speaking out, and prevent the truth being heard by the public.</p>
      <p>“Who is signing off these insulting statements being issued by the health board and are they being cleared by the Health Secretary?</p>
      <p>“The Scottish Government must now step in and put the health board into special measures, so that ministers take control, staff can speak out in confidence they will not lose their jobs, and – most importantly - parents can learn the truth.</p>
      <p>“NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is not fit for purpose.”</p>

      <p>Milly’s mum Kimberley Darroch urged NHS Great Glasgow and Clyde health board to “stop lying” about the case and demanded that Health Secretary Jane Freeman ‘told the truth’ about her daughter’s death.</p>
      <p>She previously told the Daily Record: “I feel let down and lied to. There are no words. I am in shock.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: “We are sorry for any distress and anxiety being caused to families at this time.</p>
      <p>“The sole purpose of our communications is to tell the facts. The truth is there is no way to know whether Milly’s infection was linked to the water supply as we did not consider this to be the source at the time and we did not test for the particular infection in the water supply.</p>
      <p>“A potential link between infections and the water supply only emerged the following year and this was confirmed earlier this year when Health Protection Scotland published their report on their investigations. We acted on this report and put in place extensive measures to improve the water supply, which is safe.</p>
      <p>“We are absolutely committed to providing patients and families with information and ensuring they get answers to the questions they have; it is really important that we base these answers on the facts. We are working with Professor Craig White who has been appointed by the Cabinet Secretary to provide support for families.</p>
      <p>“We always have to take care when discussing our patients not to breach their rights to confidentiality. This can make it difficult to discuss in detail individual cases but we wish to make clear that we are taking these matters extremely seriously.”</p>
