      </p>
      <p>An Edo State High Court, Criminal Division has stopped an attempt by the Nigeria Police to withdraw criminal charges against the member-elect for Ovia North East I Constituency, Mr. Dunez Onaiwu Ugiagbe.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ugiagbe is among the 14 members-elect that are yet to the inaugurated and have since relocated to Abuja.</p>
      <p>Ugiagbe was earlier arraigned in absentia on six count charge bothering on forgery and impersonation.</p>
      <p>He and others at large were said to have committed the offence around 2001.</p>
      <p>Justice Ohimai Ovbiagele had at the last sitting issued a warrant of arrest against Ugiagbe.</p>
      <p>At the resumed hearing of the case, Barr. B Omosun, a Superintendent of Police representing the CP Legal, Abuja told the court that the Police Act empowered the Police with investigation of Criminal cases.</p>
      <p>Barr. Omosun sought to withdraw the charges already in Court to complete their investigation upon receiving a petition from the suspect.</p>
      <p>But Solicitor General of the State, Barr. Oluwole Iyamu, urged the court to disregard the application saying it was a sad development that the Nigerian Police could reduce itself to the absurd level or wanting to deliberately truncate a case it is handling.</p>
      <p>Iyamu said the state complied with section 216 of the criminal code to take over the case to ensure proper dispensation justice.</p>

      <p>He urged the Judge to discountenance the appearance of the Barr. Omosun and subsequently strike out the motion.</p>
      <p>Justice Ovbiagele ruled that the appearance of Barr. Omosun be voided and therefore struck out his motion.</p>
      <p>The State Counsel then proceeded to amend the charges previously filed by the Nigerian Police though a motion filed on November 14, 2019.</p>
      <p>Barr. Paul Osarenkhoe, Counsel to Dumez UGIAGBE objected to the amendment which was overruled by the Judge.</p>
      <p>In his ruling Justice Ovbiagele ruled that the state counsel reserve the right to amend charges at any stage of the proceeding.</p>
      <p>He also ruled that the Bench Warrant served on Dumez Ugiagbe still subsist.</p>
      <p>The case was adjourned to December 17, 2019 for hearing.</p>
