      <h1>Defense Vertical Duo Charger – $10 Off [Sponsorship]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:00:59+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/davehamilton/" target="_blank">Dave Hamilton</a></address>
      <p>Please join us in thanking Defense by X-Doria as our sponsor here at TMO this week. Defense makes all kinds of great accessories for your Apple devices, including iPhone and AirPods cases, Apple Watch Bands, and wireless charging solutions.

      <h3>Two Wireless Charging Pads (and more!)</h3>
      <p>The Defense Vertical Duo Charger has two charging pads, so you can wirelessly charge both your cell phone and AirPods – or another Qi compatible device – at the same time. It provides up to 10W for the fastest possible wireless charging for your iPhone and, most-importantly, is case compatible.</p>
      <p>Its machined aluminum frame gives the charging station a sleek look that will perfectly accessorize your nightstand, room, or office desk and includes everything you need, including a USB-C cable, a QC 3.0 Power Supply, and an extra USB outlet on back to charge a 3rd device.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using the Vertical Duo Charger here at the house for a while now, and I was shocked when I realized my phone would happily charge in either portrait or landscape mode on it. I had never seen anything like this before and began wondering how they accomplished such magic. Thankfully, the picture on their website (borrowed here, on the right!) showed me that they designed the Qi coil in such a way that this is, indeed, how it was designed to work. Smart move, and super-handy.</p>
