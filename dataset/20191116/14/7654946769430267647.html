      <h1>LSU vs. Mississippi prediction, line: Take the underdog</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:31:30+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Youmans, VSiN</a></address>
      <p>A 200-1 shot when Heisman Trophy odds opened in the spring, LSU quarterback Joe Burrow is now the odds-on favorite. His stock is peaking, and the Tigers have not been this hyped since Nick Saban was their coach.</p>
      <p>Burrow turned the tide against Saban’s defense last week, connecting on 31 of 39 passes for 393 yards and three touchdowns in a 46-41 win at Alabama. A year after totaling only 16 touchdown passes, Burrow has 33 through nine games.</p>
      <p>But if there ever were a prime time to play LSU, this seems to be it. The wildest parties usually lead to the worst hangovers, so a week after looking dominant against the Crimson Tide, the Tigers could be in for an emotional letdown at Mississippi on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Rebels, who have covered five of their past six games, recently displayed an improved defense in a 24-17 loss to Texas A&amp;M and a 20-14 loss at Auburn. Mississippi also has the SEC’s No. 1 rushing offense (247.4 yards per game), an essential element in controlling the clock and keeping Burrow on the sideline in a dogfight.</p>
      <p><b>The pick:</b> Mississippi, +21½.</p>
      <p><b>Indiana Hoosiers (+14½) over PENN STATE NITTANY LIONS:</b> After their first loss of the season at Minnesota, and with Ohio State on deck, the Nittany Lions are another team in a potential letdown spot. Tom Allen has coached the Hoosiers to four consecutive Big Ten wins and a 7-2 record. Penn State won last year’s meeting 33-28, but Indiana had a big edge in total yards, 554 to 417.</p>
      <p><b>IOWA HAWKEYES (-3) over Minnesota Golden Gophers:</b> As a home underdog last week, coach P.J. Fleck guided the Gophers to their biggest win of the decade. This looks like the perfect time for a fall, which is one reason situational handicappers are playing the favorite. Minnesota’s 9-0 record includes just three road wins, all against weak defenses (Fresno State, Purdue and Rutgers).</p>
      <p>The Hawkeyes have dealt with tough luck in Big Ten play, losing three times by a total of 14 points. All of the losses were to ranked teams — Michigan, Penn State and Wisconsin — with a combined record of 22-5. Iowa has the nation’s No. 4 scoring defense (11.7 points per game), a senior quarterback and a four-game win streak in this rivalry. The Gophers have not won in Iowa City since 1999.</p>
      <p><b>BAYLOR BEARS (+10½) over Oklahoma Sooners:</b> The unbeaten Bears are disrespected home ’dogs. In his past six games as an underdog, Baylor coach Matt Rhule is 6-0 ATS with five straight-up wins. Defensive problems are resurfacing for the Sooners, who allowed a total of 89 points to Iowa State and Kansas State over the past two weeks.</p>
      <p><b>Last week:</b> 1-3<br/><b>Season:</b> 13-21-2</p>
