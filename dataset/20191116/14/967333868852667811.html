      <p>An adorable dachshund called Herbert was walking with his owner, in a park in Vienna, Austria, when a crow started to tease the little dog. The bird slowly neared the dog and bit its tail, then it flew away.</p>
      <p>"We are frequently at this park, and these crows often bully our 7-year-old dachshund, Herbert", the owner said.</p>
