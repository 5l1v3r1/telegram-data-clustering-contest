      <p>According to the testimony of David Holmes—an official of the US Embassy in Kiev, Donald Trump was advised to let A$AP Rocky get sentenced to “play the racism card.”</p>
      <p>In Holmes’ testimony, he said Trump spoke on the phone with Gordon Sondland, an American ambassador to the European Union, and said Sondland told Trump that A$AP Rocky “should have pled guilty.”</p>
      <p>Holmes said Sondland told Trump, “let [Rocky] get sentenced, play the racism card, give him a ticker-tape when he comes home." Sondland also reportedly said that if <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/256913/us-warned-sweden-of-consequences-if-aap-rocky-wasnt-released">Trump couldn’t get Rocky out of the jam</a>, he could “tell the Kardashians you tried.”</p>
