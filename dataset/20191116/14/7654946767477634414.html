      <p>At least five are dead in Bolivia after government security forces opened fire on supporters of former president Evo Morales, the Associated Press reported. Dozens more have been injured.</p>
      <p>Most of the violence unfolded in the central Bolivian cities of Sacaba and Cochabamba. Many of the dead and injured were indigenous cocoa leaf growers — among Morales’ strongest supporters.</p>
      <p>Morales ruled the country for 13 years, but was forced into exile in Mexico this month after allegations of vote-rigging in a campaign for a fourth term as president sparked nationwide protests. Morales denied the charge even as an Organization of American States review found widespread voting irregularities, the wire service reported.</p>
      <p>The country’s official ombudsman has called on the interim President Jeanine Áñez to review the deaths.</p>
      <p>“We express our alarm and concern over the result of an attempt to stop a demonstration by coca leaf growers from entering the city of Cochabamba,” they said the AP reported.</p>
