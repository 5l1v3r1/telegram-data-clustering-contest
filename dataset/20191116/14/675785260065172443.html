      <h1>Bolton fire: Blaze rips through student flats as flames 'crawl up cladding'</h1>
      <h2>Two people were injured after the huge fire broke out at The Cube student accommodation block in Bolton, Greater Manchester</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:14:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:14</time> by <a rel="author">Kara O'Neill, Abigail O'Leary</a></address>
      <p>Two people have been injured in the massive blaze that ripped through a block of student flats in Bolton last night.</p>
      <p>As many as forty fire engines raced to the scene as witnesses described looking up at a "wall of fire".</p>
      <p>Huge flames and plumes of smoke were be seen pouring from what appears to be a top floor flat at The Cube student accommodation.</p>
      <p>Paramedics treated the two victims at the scene, including one person rescued by crews via an aerial platform.</p>
      <p>Overnight and earlier today, fire chiefs urged residents in the area to contact their loved ones and let them know they are safe.</p>
      <p>They have now confirmed that all the occupants of the building have been accounted for.</p>
      <p>Videos from the scene show debris falling from the building while still alight as people on the street below looked up in horror.</p>
      <p>Students described having to flee and leave all of their belongings in the inferno.</p>
      <p>One eyewitness described the fire as "crawl[ing] up the cladding like it was nothing".</p>
      <p>Ace Love, 35, told the PA news agency: "The fire kept getting more intense, climbing up and to the right because the wind was blowing so hard.</p>
      <p>"We could see it bubbling from the outside and then being engulfed from the outside.</p>

      <p>"A lot of students got out very fast, someone was very distressed, the rest were on phones calling for help.</p>
      <p>"The fire got worse and worse, to the point where you could see through the beams, it was just bare frame."</p>
      <p>Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> tweeted this morning condemning the government over reports of the building's cladding.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Thank you to the 40 fire crews who tackled the #BoltonFire and the emergency services who treated people at the student accommodation.</p>
      <p>"If reports are correct and flammable cladding contributed to the fire, it shows the government's shameful inaction since Grenfell."</p>
      <p>University of Bolton student Shannon Parker, 22, lives in the building.</p>
      <p>She told PA: "I was in my room whilst it was happening. I heard the fire alarm going off but it kept on going off so I just thought it was a drill at first until one of my flatmates shouted down the corridor that it was a real fire.</p>

      <p>"So I ran out the flat as quickly as I could and I saw that it was one of the flats below mine and we went out by the fire exit."</p>
      <p>She said she was being relocated to either a nearby hotel or another student accommodation building.</p>
      <p>Shannon Parker wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>: "My Bolton student accommodation is on fire.</p>
      <p>"I am safe just sad that my belongings are in there! But the main thing is I’m out and I’m safe."</p>

      <p>Footage shows firefighters using aerial equipment to tackle the flames pouring from almost every window on the upper floor of the building.</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: "Around 200 firefighters were tackling the blaze, with 40 fire engines, three aerial platforms and other specialist appliances in use.</p>
      <p>"Six fire engines currently remain at the scene as firefighters tackle the last few pockets of fire.</p>
      <p>"Road closures remain in place and people are urged to stay away from the area."</p>
      <p>The Fire Service confirmed that the response is being scaled back as the fire has been brought under control.</p>
      <p>One witness described the scene as a "wall of fire" on Twitter, adding: "Really shocking, student building completely up in flames."</p>

      <p>Another witness wrote: "Been stood outside now for quite a while, can hear a lot of sirens, but only fire engines so far. Building is so gone."</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester Police said: "We are currently dealing with an incident on Bradshawgate and have a number of road closures in place.</p>
      <p>"Please avoid the area until further notice. Thank you for your cooperation."</p>
      <p>One eyewitness, Dominic Walsh said people were sheltering in The Balmoral pub as emergency crews dealt with the blaze.</p>
      <p>Professor George E Holmes DL, President and Vice Chancellor of the University of Bolton, said: "Supporting the welfare of our students is our number one priority and we have moved swiftly to assist in any way we can.</p>

      <p>"University colleagues have worked through the night to make sure support is in place for students over the weekend.</p>
      <p>"We have assisted in ensuring students have been given temporary alternative accommodation at the Orlando student halls and in some Bolton hotels.</p>
      <p>"We have also arranged to provide necessities such as toiletries for all students affected and are opening the University over the weekend so students can be supported. We will also provide food for them.</p>
      <p>"I would like to stress that The Cube is not owned by the University of Bolton. It is owned and managed by a private landlord and the students were not on our premises during this incident."</p>
