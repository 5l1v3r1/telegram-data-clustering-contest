      <p>South African Airways (SAA) began negotiations with the unions on Saturday, the second day of a strike by flight and technical personnel.</p>
      <p>According to the unions, more than 3,000 of the company’s 5,000 employees, both ground and cabin workers, are participating in the strike.</p>
      <p>The workers are demanding wage increases and the end of a restructuring plan that could lead to the loss of hundreds of jobs.</p>
      <p>On Friday and Saturday, SAA cancelled more than 300 flights on both domestic and international routes.</p>
      <p>The company announced on Saturday that the unions had agreed to sit at the bargaining table.</p>
      <p>“It is in the public interest that this dispute be resolved,” SAA Human Resources Manager Martin Kemp said Saturday in a statement welcoming “the unions’ willingness to find a solution.</p>
      <p>“We are focused on finding a solution that meets employee demands, saves the company and restores normal operations,” he added.</p>
      <p>SAA unions are calling for an 8% wage increase and a three-year employment guarantee, while the company is proposing a 5.9% increase.</p>
      <p>South African Airways is one of Africa’s leading airlines with a fleet of more than 50 aircraft. But despite government loans, it has not made any profit since 2011 and is accumulating debts.</p>
      <p>South African Airways has warned that a continuation of the strike could be fatal to it. Its spokesman Tlali Tlali said, the company is losing 52 million rand (about €3.2 million) a day due to flight cancellations.</p>
      <p>The airline has offered passengers whose flights are cancelled the opportunity to check in on other flights or with affiliated airlines.</p>
      <p>It plans to resume international flights on Sunday and domestic flights on Tuesday.</p>
