      <p>CONCERNS have been raised over the Christmas  lighting scheme in Mayo's leading tourist town.</p>
      <p>The matter was highlighted by Councillor  Johnny O'Malley who cited the fact no funding had been set aside for the scheme this year by Mayo County Council.</p>
      <p>Councillor Peter Flynn echoed his concerns in relation to the issue.</p>
      <p>He said with Castlebar and Ballina due to switch on their festive lights next Friday, no such arrangements are in place for Westport.</p>
      <p>He said he appreciated officials of Westport Municipal District will try to rescue the situation at this late stage.</p>
      <p>But they were forced to do so under challenging financial restraints.</p>
