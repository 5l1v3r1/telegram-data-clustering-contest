      <p>"Andrew is a true+real gentleman and is stoically steadfast to not only his duty but also his kindness + goodness @TheDukeOfYork." They were married from 1986 to 1996.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/british-royals">Duke of York</a>, 59, admitted: “I kick myself ... on a daily basis” for being friends with and staying with Epstein on multiple occasions.</p>

      <p>“I stayed with him and that’s [something] I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that,” the second son of Queen Elizabeth said.</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew also addressed his relationship (or lack thereof) with Virginia Roberts (now Virginia Giuffre), who alleged that she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times between 1999 and 2002 in London and on Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.</p>

      <p>Giuffre claimed that Epstein paid her to have sex with the British royal and she was just 17 years old during her first experience.</p>
      <p>In August, Buckingham Palace said in a statement that Andrew was "appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes," which include the sex trafficking of girls as young as 14 years old.</p>

      <p>“His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behavior is abhorrent,” the palace said.</p>
