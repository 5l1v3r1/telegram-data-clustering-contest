      <p>French rider Fabio Quartararo was in front of everyone on the first day of free practice sessions in Valencia. After having sealed the reference time in the morning, Fabio saw it fit to do the same in the afternoon, bringing his Yamaha to the top. Things couldn't have gone better than that for the SIC Petronas rider, even if he's almost three tenths away from Vinales and Lorenzo.</p>
      <p><i>"I'm really happy about my performance in the flying lap</i>," Fabio began<i>. "My pace is not bad, but I'm losing a few tenths too many. <b>We need to understand what the problem is, since we struggle, especially in the last sector of the track. </b>But I'm confident because the team knows how to work to solve this problem."</i></p>
      <p>So Fabio is looking for the right path to follow.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"To tell you the truth, Valencia is not a track that I love, ever since my Moto2 days and, with the MotoGP, it's even more difficult. Like I said, I'll have to work to understand the tires well and find a solution together with the team to be fast during the race weekend."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Those who seem to be one step ahead are Vinales and especially Marquez.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"<b>I'll have to study Maverick's data to understand and analyze the situation, since he and Marc are certainly the fastest at the moment</b>. The problem in Sepang? That has nothing to do with it. What happened in Malaysia is something that usually happens to us on fast tracks like Mugello and Barcelona. We'll certainly have to keep that in mind for the future."</i>
      </p>
      <p>One last thing on Lorenzo's farewell to the races.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>“He set an example for me, especially because of his very gentle riding style. He struggled this year, but we can't forget his past. He'll always remain a legend."</i>
