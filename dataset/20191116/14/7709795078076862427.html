      <h3>Slovenia v Latvia - 17:00 GMT</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>A dead rubber contest in Group G where Slovenia welcome a Latvia side who are bottom by a distance.</p>
      <p>The visitors have lost all eight of their games so far, conceding an eye-watering tally of 27 goals and posting just two in return.</p>
      <p>The hosts looked in a decent position to finish in the top-two spots but consecutive losses to Austria and North Macedonia have seen them slip to fourth, although they should at least finish their home campaign on a high here.</p>
      <p>Slovenia ran out convincing 5-0 winners when these two teams met in Riga in June and it wouldn't be a surprise to see a similar result here. Slovenia's -2 handicap price sitting at even money is decent enough value in a contest that seems so one-sided.</p>
      <p>Instead though, there is real appeal in the general 15/2 available on Josip Ilicic netting a brace on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Atalanta man has fluctuated between the wing and secondary striker roles during Slovenia's qualifying campaign so far but has shown that he can strike in either position.</p>
      <p>He has had direct involvement in five goals so far and netted two in that 5-0 hammering of Latvia in their last meeting.</p>
      <p>Ilicic has four goals and two assists on his Serie A tally too. A forward who is carrying decent enough form and can capitalise on the low level of opposition in their next contest.</p>

      <h3>Northern Ireland v Netherlands - 19:45 GMT</h3>

      <p>Windsor Park will bid farewell to Michael O'Neill on Saturday with his eight-year association with the national side coming to an end this international break.</p>
      <p>He has taken up the job at Stoke. The Potters allowed him to finish off the qualifying campaign with his country despite having already overseen one game in the Sky Bet Championship - that was a 4-2 victory over Barnsley.</p>
      <p>The Green and White Army ideally need to win both of their remaining qualifiers if they are to finish in the top-two - although they could reach the finals through the Nations League route depending on other outcomes.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands may be odds-on favourites for victory here but I'm genuinely leaning more towards a home win if I was going to go for the outright result.</p>
      <p>It was a heart-breaking defeat in the reverse fixture with the Netherlands striking late and Northern Ireland ran Germany close in their meeting in Belfast - a performance that was disguised among deceptive statistics.</p>
      <p>That meeting in Rotterdam sparked some controversial comments from Dutch boss Ronald Koeman, who said: "It is outrageous, the football they play, but it is allowed and they get the most out of their qualities.</p>
      <p>"I respect that, but it is terrible to watch."</p>
      <p>What has been a feature of this Northern Ireland team though is their ability to remain in contests, particularly in the first-half. Late on is where there have been issues, a lack of concentration a potential reason but it's likely down to the opposition's superior quality.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands will not have an easy evening, even if they do end up with all three points. Windsor Park boasts one of the best atmospheres in international football, Germany found that out first hand, and the occasion will only fuel the noise coming from the terraces.</p>
      <p>In theory, the Netherlands should brush aside this Northern Ireland side with little issue. Football doesn't work like that though and there are factors that give the hosts that extra edge.</p>
      <p>The desire to finish O'Neill's reign on a high, coupled with Koeman's comments fresh in their mind, should counteract any skill advantage the Netherlands may possess.</p>

      <h3>Opta facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Northern Ireland have beaten Netherlands once in seven previous attempts (P7 W1 D2 L4) – a 2-1 victory at Windsor Park in March 1965 with goals from Johnny Crossan and Terry Neill.</li>
        <li>Netherlands have won each of their last three meetings with Northern Ireland, scoring 10 goals and conceding just once, including a 3-1 win back in October.</li>
        <li>Northern Ireland have won six of their last eight matches, losing the other two – though those two losses have come across their last three matches.</li>
        <li>Netherlands have won each of their last four matches since losing to Portugal in the UEFA Nations League final in June – they could win five games on the bounce for the first time since November 2017 under Dick Advocaat.</li>
        <li>Northern Ireland are looking to avoid losing three consecutive European Championship qualifying matches for the first time since October 2011 (four games).</li>
        <li>Josh Magennis is the only Northern Ireland player to have scored more than once during this qualifying campaign; the Hull City forward has scored three goals in just 157 minutes of action (52 minutes per goal), each time from the bench.</li>
        <li>Netherlands forward Memphis Depay has been directly involved in 12 goals in five games during this qualifying campaign (six goals and six assists), at least five more than any teammate.</li>
      </ul>
