      <h1>Kim Kardashian Meets Rodney Reed After He Has Been Granted Stay Of Execution</h1>

      <p>It’s been recently reported by The Shade Room that the Texas Parole Board called on Texas Governor Greg Abbott to delay the execution of Rodney Reed. This was based on some newly found evidence.</p>
      <p>More good news came after that, and it’s been revealed that his scheduled execution has been stayed indefinitely by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>
      <p>In other words, this means that he doesn’t have an execution date anymore.</p>

      <p>Kim Kardashian could not be happier, and she met with Reed. She also made sure to update her fans on social media on how it all went. Here’s her message:</p>
      <p>‘Today, I had the honor of meeting #RodneyReed in person and the privilege of sitting with him when he got the news that the highest court in Texas had issued a stay of execution and remanded the case back to the trial court for further consideration. Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment. That hope had been building over the last few weeks around Rodney’s case,’ Kim began.</p>
      <p>She continued and said: ‘We have seen Democrats and Republicans come together. We have seen grassroots activists and lawmakers link arms. We have heard people all around the globe speak up. And all because of a deep belief that every man or woman accused of a crime – especially one punishable by death – deserves the chance to have all available evidence considered.’</p>

      <p>Another follower posted: ‘So grateful for the commitment and passion of everyone who voiced their support, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their recommendation to issue a 120 day reprieve, and the courts for issuing a stay!’</p>
      <p>People are congratulating Kim for her help.</p>
      <p>Someone said: ‘Kim, you truly are an earthly angel. I have mad respect for you.’</p>
      <p>Another commenter wrote: ‘Kim Kardashian doing more for the black community than black women 🍵’ and one follower posted this: ‘Such great News! You are going to be such a great lawyer!’</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more details on this case.</p>
