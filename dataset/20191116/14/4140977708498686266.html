                      <p>This reply by Steyn has made fans chuckle, and it is certain that Steyn would be picked at a decent price for the flair he brings on the field through his experience.</p>

                          <p>The South African bowler was released by RCB over his fitness issues. Steyn has been suffering from various issues related to his shoulder and ankle since 2016, which has reduced the number of appearances and form over time.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>A shoulder injury in Australia led him to miss a year of cricket after having surgery on it. He returned to cricket in 2018 against India at home, but hurt his ankle and this has resulted in him retiring from Test cricket after playing 93 Tests.</p>
                            <p>Apart from Steyn, RCB has further <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/ipl-2020-released-players-list-which-players-have-been-released-by-ipl-teams-ahead-of-ipl-2020-auction/">released 12 players</a> from the team and would attempt an overhaul in the auctions with a <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/ipl-2020-purse-remaining-and-list-of-retained-players-for-all-ipl-teams/">budget of 27.9 crore rupees</a>. Meanwhile, Moeen Ali and AB de Villiers are the only foreign players which were retained by the Bangalore based franchise.</p>
