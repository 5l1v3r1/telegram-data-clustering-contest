      <p>Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Saturday launched a project that will connect 500 secondary schools to virtual classrooms and said schools in the state facing a shortage of teachers will benefit from the new technology.</p>
      <p>Virtual classes are attended through video conferences where students can meet the teacher on a real-time basis and ask questions.<br/>An estimated 1.90 lakh students of 500 government-run secondary schools in the state will benefit from the project, an official release here said.</p>
      <p>Using the platform to interact with students of the schools at the launch, Rawat said, “No technology can replace teachers in an education system but schools with a shortage of teachers will definitely benefit from the new technology.”</p>
      <p>Initially, 150 schools have been connected with the project, which works on a two-way seamless interactivity, and the remaining 350 will be linked with it over the next 15 days, according to the release.</p>
