      <h1>Sidharth Malhotra Starrer Marjaavaan Movie LEAKED Online by Tamilrockers Within Hours Of Release</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:50:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://topyaps.com/author/mukesh/" target="_blank">Mukesh</a></address>
      <p>Milap Zaveri’s romantic action movie, Marjaavaan has reportedly been leaked by Tamilrockers within hours of its theatrical release. Described by, co-producer, Bhushan Kumar as “a violent, dramatic love story”, the movie stars Siddharth Roy Kapoor, Tara Sutaria, Rakul Preet Singh, Nushrat Bharucha and Riteish Deshmukh in leading roles. Riteish Deshmukh’s role as a dwarf antagonist character created quite the buzz with the release of its trailer earlier. Made with a budget of 70 crores, the movie has been said to have made 7 crores on the first day of its release. Marjaavaan received mixed reviews and it was slated to do business worth 15 crores over the weekend but having been leaked online before the weekend, the movie would surely take a hit on the box office collections.</p>

      <p>It has been speculated that <a href="https://www.adsindia.co.in/tag/tamilrockers/">Tamilrockers constantly changes their domains</a> and uses the services of Cloudflare and Imperva while keeping their servers in Ukraine and Netherlands which help them escape any kind of action taken by the HIgh Courts or the Film Body.The notorious piracy website has been responsible for leaking big budgeted movies like Petta, <a href="https://topyaps.com/avengers-endgame-full-movie-leaked-tamilrockers/">Avengers Endgame</a>, Simmba and <a href="https://topyaps.com/tamilrockers-leaked-kabir-singh-for-download/">Kabir Singh</a> in the past. The Film Body has been struggling to curb piracy and despite stringent actions being taken by the government and strict laws being passed from the High Court, the piracy website Tamilrockers continues to flourish and leak movies every week. We urge all our readers to not download pirated movies and stand against the evil of piracy.<br/><b>Also read</b> – Why You Should Avoid Websites Like <a href="https://topyaps.com/filmywap-com-piracy-site-leaked-movies/">Fimywap </a>&amp; Get latest news about <a href="https://topyaps.com/tag/isaimini-tamil-movies-2018/">isaimini</a>, <a href="https://topyaps.com/tag/jio-rockers-2019/">JioRockers </a>&amp; <a href="https://topyaps.com/tag/tamilrockers/">Tamilrockers </a>here</p>
