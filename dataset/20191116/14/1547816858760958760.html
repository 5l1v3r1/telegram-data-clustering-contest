      <p>Suits actor Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in 2018, however, she still hasn't acquired her British Citizenship yet. As per reports, Meghan who is a US citizen is still awaiting her citizenship despite applying for it two years ago. Though a royal, she isn't getting any concession and all the processes for being a British citizen are being followed. A friend close to the actor-turned-royal has made this revelation.</p>
      <p>To Dailymail, the friend, quoted, "Meghan is not yet a British citizen. It might seem extraordinary, given that she's been married to the Queen's grandson for 18 months, but she accepts that it's a slow process." Reportedly, she applied for UK citizenship two years ago, but as revealed by Princeâ€™s communication secretary, Jason Knauf, the process can take years. He was earlier quoted saying, "I can also say she intends to become a UK citizen and will go through the process of that, which some of you may know takes a number of years."</p>
      <p>While Meghan isn't a UK citizen as of yet, her and Prince Harry's son Archie is one as he was born in the country. Being a citizen gives you the power to vote in elections, which the royal family is entitled to, but Meghan can not exercise this power as she is not a British Citizen.</p>
