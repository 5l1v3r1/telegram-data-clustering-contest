        <b>EX-RANGERS star Richard Foster has revealed he gets "abused everywhere" as he reflected on his career.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Foster, who now plays for <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14924/ross-county/">Ross County</a>, opened up about his relationship with fans and told how he gets booed and jeered just about wherever he plays.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/be8e14e4-07e4-11ea-a54d-e177f6bc2c05?ni-statuscode=acsaz-307">The Times</a>, the 34-year-old said: "I get it from Aberdeen fans for going to Rangers.</p>
      <p>“I get it from Rangers fans for being crap in my second spell there. I get it from Celtic fans because I played for Rangers. I get it from the Hamilton fans, from Motherwell fans; I’ve had it from the Dundee fans.</p>
      <p>"I mean, do I have one of those faces that everyone loves to hate?”</p>
      <p>Foster is known to have a loaded relationship with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Dons</a> fans - despite playing over 270 games for the team over an 11-year period.</p>
      <p>He said: "To this day Aberdeen fans boo me for the full 90 minutes, whether I’m visiting Pittodrie, or at any other ground.</p>
      <p>"The first time I went back to Pittodrie after leaving Aberdeen I couldn’t believe the level of consistent abuse they gave me. I mean, I got the ball in the 89th minute and they were still booing me. I thought: ‘surely you guys have given up by now?’ You just think, ‘Jesus Christ, guys, get over it.’"</p>

      <p>It comes after the footballer recently returned to Ross County - following a flare-up with St Johnstone gaffer Tommy Wright.</p>
      <p>We previously reported how Foster had left Saints after the<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4646094/richard-foster-st-johnstone-tommy-wright/"> training-ground bust-up</a> in the summer - sparking a heated exchange between Wright and Foster's wife pop star <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4803548/amy-macdonald-st-johnstone-fans-abuse/">Amy Macdonald</a>.</p>
      <p>Talking about the incident, the footballer revealed that maybe the "disagreement" went a "step too far".</p>
      <p>He said: "I had a training ground disagreement with Tommy that you’ll see many times at clubs. But maybe we all took it a step too far; it sort of went too far to be brought back.</p>

      <p>"It was heated but not abusive. When I went to Ross County and we played St Johnstone a couple of weeks after I’d left, I made a point of shaking Tommy’s hand, and he texted me later saying ‘all the best’.</p>
      <p>“It was unfortunate the way it ended at St Johnstone, but I leapt at the chance to go back to County. I get on well with everyone there.”</p>
      <p>We previously told how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4803548/amy-macdonald-st-johnstone-fans-abuse/">Amy had a cheeky dig</a> at St Johnstone fans who called her a "w***e" following her hubby's controversial exit from the Saints during the summer.</p>
      <p>It followed her hit back at <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4728577/amy-macdonald-tommy-wright-richard-foster-st-johnstone-2/">St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright</a> over his "casual misogyny" in his "Mrs Foster" remark.</p>
      <p>The war of words between the pair kicked off after Macdonald branded the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4722007/amy-macdonald-tommy-wright-richard-foster-st-johnstone/">Northern Irishman "hot-headed"</a> during an appearance on Radio Scotland's Off The Ball. Wright later claimed her version of events were miles away from the truth.</p>
