        <b>Former Manchester United star Romelu Lukaku has revealed that he wanted to leave the club several months before the move was finalized – and also added that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was actually interested in retaining him ahead of the 2019-20 season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Solskjaer has my eternal respect. He understood me when I said in March that it was time for me to leave Manchester United,” he was quoted as saying, by <a href="https://www.hbvl.be/cnt/dmf20191116_04719019/wij-kennen-geen-genade-meer"><i>Het Belang van Limburg</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“I have been in the Premier League as an 18-year-old boy and now I am 26. Solskjaer wanted to keep me, but I was ready for something new.”</p>
      <p>The Belgian striker also said that he is enjoying working under Inter Milan boss Antonio Conte, who was also the former manager of Juventus and Chelsea.</p>
      <p>“I have had a good relationship with trainer Antonio Conte for three years and I know exactly what he expects of me,” Lukaku said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“The first two weeks at Inter I worked very hard with the group and when my teammates got some rest, I trained individually.”</p>
      <p>“Thanks to my football intelligence, I integrated easily. We play in a system with two strikers and that suits me. Anyway, I already knew my team-mates in advance.”</p>
