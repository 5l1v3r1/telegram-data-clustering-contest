      <p>A large fire broke out across from the historic Castro Theatre early Saturday morning, injuring two people and displacing a number of residents.</p>
      <p>The fire started at about 4:30 a.m. behind the building of 456 Castro Street which houses the popular Q Bar, with residences above the business. The flames spread to a neighboring residential building, also with a street-level commercial space.</p>
      <p>Three businesses were reportedly affected by the fire and 13 people are displaced. One person "with serious injuries" was taken to a hospital, and a firefighter sustained minor injuries, according to the San Francisco Fire Department.</p>
      <p>Photos and video on social media show flames and a wall of smoke rising from one of the buildings in the 400 block of Castro Street, at about 5 a.m. The <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Firefighters-battle-blaze-in-SF-s-Castro-14840051.php">Chronicle</a> reported that fire crews "gained control" over the fire at around 6 a.m. and was fully contained by 10 a.m.</p>
