      <p>While 4,418 students from Jammu and Kashmir took admission under the scheme this year, the figure was 2,543 in 2018. As many as 3,021 students enrolled in 2017 while, 2,168 students, 1,341 and 1,968 candidates enrolled in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.</p>

      <p>In August, the Supreme Court, on the state administration’s request, had extended the deadline for PMSSS scholars to report at their respective institutes by a month — from August 15 to September 15. The state had approached the apex court anticipating that students from the Valley might not be able to join on time because of the curbs.</p>
