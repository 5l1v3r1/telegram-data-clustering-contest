      <p><b>EAST WINDSOR, Conn.Â (AP)</b> - A 40-year-old Connecticut man has been charged in the death of his father.</p>
      <p>The Hartford Courant reports that Gabriel Hesse, of East Windsor, was arrested at his Main Street home Friday evening and charged with murder. He is being held on $2 million bond. It was not immediately clear if he has obtained an attorney.</p>
      <p>Hesse is accused of killing his 73-year-old father, Halsey Hesse, who was found dead Oct. 9 in the kitchen of his East Windsor home. A family member discovered his body after failing to reach him by phone for several days.</p>
      <p>Police said he had been stabbed multiple times. His death was ruled a homicide.</p>
      <p>Gabriel Hesse is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Enfield Superior Court.</p>
