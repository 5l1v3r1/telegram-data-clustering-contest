      <p>Everton will play Fleetwood Town at home in the next round of the EFL Trophy after progressing through the group stage as winners.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/david-unsworth">David Unsworth's</a> made it to Round Two of the Leasing.com Trophy for the first time thanks to a win over Burton Albion and draws with Crewe Alexandra and Mansfield - winning a penalty shootout to take an extra point following the latter.</p>
      <p>The young Blues are taking part in the tournament for the fourth time, but will be playing their first knockout match this year.</p>
      <p>The tie is set for the week commencing December 2nd, the same week the senior side will be facing Liverpool in the first Merseyside derby of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> finished one point clear at the top of thier group, with League Two side Mansfield Town finishing in second place.</p>
      <p>"To be unbeaten against three Football League sides, to win one and draw two, that makes me very proud," Unsworth told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> after watching his side draw with Crewe.</p>
      <p>"To get through to the latter stages is great for the players. We haven't managed to do it in the last couple of years, so that's been a bit of a disappointment.</p>
      <p>"But tonight we got the result and I'm looking forward to these latter stages."</p>
