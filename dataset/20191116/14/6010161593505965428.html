      <h1>Path of Exile 2 in development, beta planned for “very late 2020”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:36:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author">Stephany Nunneley</a></address>
      <p>Path of Exile 2 was announced during ExileCon 2019, and it will be available alongside the original game’s campaign.</p>
      <p>Grinding Gear Games has announced <b>Path of Exile</b> <b>2</b> is in the works. It will include a seven-act storyline available alongside the original game’s campaign.</p>
      <p>According to the studio, both the old and new storylines will lead to the same, shared Atlas endgame. It will also retain all of the expansion content created over the last six years and engine improvements.</p>
      <p>“Over the years there have been many changes that we would have loved to make to but couldn’t because they would break existing characters,” <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/exilecon/one">said the studio</a>. “This is an opportunity to make all of these changes in one large update.”</p>

      <p>Set 20 years after the events of the first game, you can expect 19 new Ascendancy classes. It also features a new skill gem system. Here, Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems which will “remove the frustrations present in the old system,” while still maintaining depth. It will be possible to six-link every skill your character uses.</p>
      <p>Armor and weapons progressions have been revamped, and you can expect new character models and animation. Also, all of your old microtransactions will still be compatible with the new game.</p>
      <p>The studio said it would touch upon the passive skill systems and other core game system changes at a later date.</p>
      <p>Because development is still early, a release date was not provided; however, the developers are shooting to open up a beta for “very late 2020.”</p>
      <p>Until then, you can continue to expect expansions every three months as usual. The next expansion, <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/exilecon/two"><b>Conquerors of the Atlas</b></a>, is coming on December 13. The next challenge league for Path of Exile, <b><a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/exilecon/three">Metamorph</a></b>, is due out alongside the expansion.</p>
      <p>Path of Exile is available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. The dungeon crawler is one of the titles <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/04/26/best-free-games-ps4-xbox-one/">on our list of best free-to-play games</a>.</p>
