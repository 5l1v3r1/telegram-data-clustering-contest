        <b>The Consulate General of Portugal in Macao and Hong Kong has asked Portuguese students in the former British colony to send their personal data for support at a time of violent clashes in universities of the territory.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The diplomatic representation “requests all Portuguese-speaking students in Hong Kong to send us via email to <a href="mailto:macau@mne.pt">macau@mne.pt</a> the following information: name; Citizen's card or passport; telephone contact; email; university where they are studying”, reads a statement issued on Facebook by the Portuguese consulate.</p>
      <p>"This information is essential for the consulate to be able to provide any support if the need arises," he said.</p>
      <p>In an emergency, the Consulate added, students can "seek support by calling +853 28356632 or <a href="mailto:macau@mne.pt">macau@mne.pt</a> or the Consular Emergency Office (24-hour call) at +351 217929714 / +351 961706472 or from the address <a href="mailto:gec@mne.pt">gec@mne.pt</a>".</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's universities have since Monday, 11 November, become the scene of violent clashes for the first time.</p>
      <p>At the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) police on Tuesday, 12 November, used tear gas and rubber bullets against hundreds of protesters who built makeshift barricades and threw bricks, Molotov cocktails, and other objects at the authorities.</p>
      <p>On the morning of the 13 November (dawn in Lisbon) protesters re-built makeshift barriers and laid bricks on roads all over the city as well as at some universities, with CUHK experiencing moments of increased tension, according to South China Morning Post (SCMP).</p>
      <p>In the city's financial area, several police arrests have already been made.</p>
      <p>At least 11 higher education institutions have announced that classes are suspended, according to broadcaster RTHK.</p>
      <p>According to SCMP, CUHK will suspend classes until the end of the month.</p>
      <p>More than 80 mainland Chinese students from CUHK have been pulled off campus due to clashes. These Chinese students were transported to the neighbouring city of Shenzhen, the SCMP reported.</p>
      <p>Several hundred protesters are still on the CUHK campus despite the night of chaos and violent clashes with police the day before.</p>
      <p>At a press conference, Hong Kong police accused CUHK of becoming a "weapons factory". The forces said 400 Molotov cocktail bombs were dropped against authorities on Tuesday, 12 November, and "several hundred" were dropped on the university's campus. On the police side, 1,567 shots of tear gas were fired on Tuesday and 1,312 rubber bullets.</p>
      <p>Many subway and train stations were closed after anti-government and pro-democracy protesters blocked entry and vandalized facilities.</p>
