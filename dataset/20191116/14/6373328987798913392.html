      <h1>Joker Box Office Breaks $1 Billion, First R-Rated Movie In History To Do So</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:26:03+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/author/cameron-frew/" target="_blank">Cameron Frew</a></address>

        <b>It’s all part of the plan: <i>Joker</i> has crossed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office becoming the first R-rated film ever to do so. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Since its release in October, the Clown Prince of Crime has been a fixture in headlines across the globe. From mass shooting concerns, polarising opinions and record after record, one thing’s for sure: people are talking about <i>Joker</i>.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/joker-beats-venom-to-become-octobers-biggest-box-office-opening-ever/">best October opening of all time</a>, to highest grossing R-rated film in cinema history (not adjusted for inflation), it was only a matter of time before the Batman foe’s origin story joined the lucrative $1bn club.</p>

      <p>The film’s global box office take was sitting at $999.1 million yesterday, November 15. Exhibitor Relations Co. then confirmed on Twitter that it had reached the massive milestone (the exact figure has still to be released).</p>

      <p>It was only weeks ago that <i>Joker</i> sailed past <i>The Matrix Reloaded </i>and <i>Deadpool 2</i> as the <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/joker-becomes-highest-grossing-r-rated-movie-of-all-time/">highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time</a>.</p>
      <p>Ryan Reynolds – who stars as the sweary, spandex-wearing hero – even took a moment to congratulate the Clown Prince of Crime on Instagram, <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/ryan-reynolds-congratulates-joker-for-breaking-deadpool-2-record/">in true R-rated fashion.</a></p>

      <p><i>Joker</i> joins <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 </i>($1.34bn), <i>Aquaman</i> ($1.148bn), <i>The</i> <i>Lord of the Rings: Return of the King </i>($1.12bn), <i>The Dark Knight Rises </i>($1.08bn), <i>The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey </i>($1.01bn), and <i>The</i> <i>Dark Knight </i>($1bn).</p>
      <p>What’s particularly impressive is that <i>Joker</i> has yet to be released in China, still managing to bag a seismic box office without one of the key markets.</p>
      <p>Also, with only a humble budget of $62.5 million, <i>Joker</i> has become the most profitable comicbook movie of all time too.</p>
      <p>The film has been critically-acclaimed, swooping the Golden Lion (a highly prestigious award, generally a precursor to a Best Picture Oscar nomination), at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
      <p>Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the titular villain, is a hot favourite as predictions for next year’s Oscars start to roll in – as it stands, Phoenix and Adam Driver (for <i>Marriage Story</i>) are the front-runners for Best Leading Actor.</p>

      <p>It’s currently sitting at 69% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the site’s critics’ consensus calling it ‘a chillingly plausible origin story that serves as a brilliant showcase for its star’.</p>
      <p><i>UNILAD</i> called <i>Joker</i> our <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/featured/joker-is-a-terrifying-harrowing-volatile-triumph-of-a-movie/">film of the year</a>, describing it as a ‘terrifying, harrowing, volatile triumph’.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Joker is in cinemas now.</i>
