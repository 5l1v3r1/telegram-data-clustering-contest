It's tiring."</i><br/><br/>He continued, <i>"There's a soccer gathering every Thursday with Kim Jong Kook hyung. One day, I was sick with a cold, so I told him I couldn't go. He responded, 'Did you just make a typo? Not a fracture, but a cold? If you have a cold, you don't come play soccer?'," </i>revealing how Kim Jong Kook was tough on him.<br/><br/>DinDin added, <i>"One time, we were done with soccer, and I cried in the car driving home. I was so tired. I was listening to <b>Giriboy</b>'s '<b>Traffic Control</b>', and tears fell down my face as I wondered why I had to play soccer when I'm so tired."<b> </b></i></p>
