      <p>One person was trapped in a pile-up involving three cars and a van on the A19 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ambulances, police and fire crews were called at 12.35pm to a crash on the A19, just north of the junction with the A1231.</p>
      <p>As of 2pm, a spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-east-ambulance-service">North East Ambulance Service</a> (NEAS) said more paramedics were being sent to the scene, where the emergency services had to fight to free one casualty.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for NEAS said: "There is believed to have been three cars and a van involved, one person was believed to have been trapped.</p>
      <p>“We are still on scene, with more resources on the way. There are believed to be four patients: three which are intended to be treated and discharged on scene and a fourth who is to be taken to hospital.”</p>
      <p>It's believed the injuries are not life-threatening.</p>
      <p>Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service also sent four fire crews to assist with the rescue, which caused heavy traffic on between the junctions of the A1231 Sunderland Highway (North Hylton ) to A1290 (Boldon Colliery), slowing all cars travelling between Seaham and South Shields.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Northumbria Police said: "We are currently dealing with a four vehicle collision on the A19 northbound, just before the junction with the A1231. <br/><br/>"Emergency services are at the scene and the road is currently closed. <br/><br/>"A diversions is in place but please find an alternative route where possible."</p>
