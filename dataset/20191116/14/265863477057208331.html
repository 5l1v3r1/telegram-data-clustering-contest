      <p>Kodak Black is definitely not living his best life these days. Just after he’s been sentenced to about four years in federal prison, he has been hit with two more weapon charges that could cost him even more time.</p>
      <p>The Shade Room cited the info from Miami Herald and reported that ‘the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s office formally charged Kodak with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon today.’</p>
      <p>TSR continued and said that ‘If convicted on these new charges, Kodak could serve up to 30 years in prison on each count as a “habitual violent offender.”’</p>
      <p>It’s been also revealed that according to court documents, prosecutors filed one count for a gun purchased by Kodak in January as you can see in TSR’s post below.</p>

      <p>Someone commented: ‘Just leave him alone damn the entire world our to get him.’</p>
      <p>Another follower said: ‘😂 rappers be having millions but won’t pay a couple hundred on a gun license lmaooo!!’</p>
      <p>Someone posted: ‘When all he had to do,… was stay away from guns??!!!! How tha fk hard is that for real????’</p>
      <p>One other follower wrote: ’30 years in prison for gun charges but amber guyger serves 10 years for LEGIT WALKING INTO A STRANGERS HOME. SHOOTING &amp; KILLING HIM? White privilege is REAL.’</p>
      <p>A person said: ‘That’s Strong, but he should’ve respected his freedom 🤷🏾‍♀️ minded his business and made his music.’</p>
      <p>Not too long ago, <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/kodak-black-will-most-likely-serve-his-sentence-in-its-entirety-attorney-explains-heres-why-340707/">attorney Lee Pearlman chatted with HollywoodLife</a>, revealing that the rapper has few chances to be released earlier on.</p>
      <p>Pearlman explained that the 46 months he will have to remain in prison is ‘a reasonable amount’ of time.</p>
      <p>But since then, as you read above, two more charges came along. Stay tuned for more info about Kodak’s case.</p>
