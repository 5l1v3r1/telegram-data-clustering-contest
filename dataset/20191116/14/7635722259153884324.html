        <b>Nearly 500 Gardaí have faced disciplinary action in less than three years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Breaches of discipline can result in officers being sacked or having their wages cut.</p>
      <p>These figures show there has been a decline in disciplinary cases within the force over the past three years.</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan released the figures to Fianna Fáil's Jim O' Callaghan following a request.</p>

      <p>They show 190 officers were punished in 2017, 167 in 2018 and so far this year 136 members of on An Garda Síochána have been disciplined.</p>
      <p>The numbers also include 14 sergeants or higher-ranked Gardaí this year.</p>
      <p>As part of the <b>'<a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/A_Policing_Service_for_the_Future.pdf/Files/A_Policing_Service_for_the_Future.pdf">Policing Service for the Future</a></b>' report, a Discipline Review Committee has been set up to oversee the process.</p>
