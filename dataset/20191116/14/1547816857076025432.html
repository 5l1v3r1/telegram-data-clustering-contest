      <p>Just a few days ago, Rani Mukerji released the first trailer of the much-awaited Mardaani 2 which was not only hard-hitting but completely shook us with her stellar performance and intense content. As soon as the trailer hit the internet, people started pouring in praises for Rani and the trailer as well. However, a certain section of people is not so impressed by the trailer that made them protest against the film. According to a Pinkvilla report, Kota Residents have started protesting against Rani Mukerji’s Mardaani 2 for throwing Kota under the bad light.</p>
      <p>Knowing the story is about hunting the rapists and murderers in the Kota city and the story is inspired by true events, this added more fuel to the fire as Kota residents felt that it is hampering the city's reputation. With this, the protestors have asked the makers to remove 'Kota' word from the movie. This doesn’t end here, the report further stated that the residents also met Lok Sabha Speaker and the MP from Kota, Om Birla to discuss this matter. </p>

      <p>When the matter came to Birla, he released a statement and stated “I will definitely discuss the issue with the concerned people. Maligning a city's name through cinema is not acceptable. The incident on which the film is based is also fictional. So, for a fictional story taking the name of a city is not right.” As quoted by the portal.</p>

      <p>For now, we have to see how the makers will handle this situation. Meanwhile, Rani will be reprising her role as Shivani Shivaji Roy – the badass cop who goes out of her way to hunt down the rapist and the murderer who has created a havoc in the city. The film is scheduled to hit the big screens on December 13, 3019.</p>
