      <p>Stonebwoy has been spotted on a giant quad bike with a beautiful bandana worn around his head instead of a helmet.</p>
      <p>We don’t know where exactly he was going or whether he posed on the bike to take a shot from the lenses of the camera.</p>
      <p>Whatever the motive is, he should never compromise on his safety.</p>
      <p>In a related development, The BET award winning artist confirmed to Abeiku Santana on Okay FM in an interview that he’s dropping three songs this December.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/stonebwoy-set-to-drop-new-banger-titled-sobolo-ft-kuame-eugene-next-week/">Stonebwoy also confirmed featuring Kuame Eugene and Kidi</a> on one of the songs (we guess it is the ‘Sobolo’). He also revealed he has one song produced by Beatz Dakay titled ‘More’ with the third song unknown.</p>
