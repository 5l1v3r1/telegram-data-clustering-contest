      <p>Coldrin Coetzee is still only just 30, but he is already aiming to shape the future of South African football away from the public glare – in Rustenburg.</p>
      <p>Wondering where youth internationals such as Gift Links and Kobamelo Kodisang were able to cut their teeth as players before they shot to prominence, eventually securing moves abroad to Denmark and Portugal respectively?</p>
      <p>
        <i>

      </p>
      <p>Ask Coetzee, a former Platinum Stars, Free State Stars and Milano United central midfielder, who retired at the end of the 2016-17 campaign.</p>
      <p>“I came to Rustenburg for a short trial with Platinum Stars and when things didn’t work out the way I wanted them to I ended up with a coaching job,” says Coetzee, now coaching Athletico Football Club, who are preparing for the annual youth cup later this month.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He adds that the focus is also beyond just successfully hosting their tenth edition of the u/18 tournament, especially given the list of players who have gone on to turn professional on the back of their involvement with AFC, formed in 2002.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a lot of players that have done great over a number of years now. We are proud to say they are coming from us – Links, Kodisang, Cyril Chibwe (Polokwane City) and Sibusiso Mabiliso (AmaZulu) just to mention a few,” Coetzee explains.</p>
      <p>Two weekends from now, the AFC Youth Cup returns with the hope that it is bigger and better and having seen the talent that’s associated with the tournament and now playing for clubs abroad and in the local PSL, their reputation precedes them.</p>
      <p>“My journey here has shown that we are not just about making good footballers. We are producing good human beings as well. We had a recent trip to England and a lot of the guys were flying for the first time also. I really feel I have added value here,” the former midfielder says, adding that his aim is now to get his coaching badges to help young players go further than where his own football career couldn’t take him.</p>
