      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:33:19+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Nebraska’s football program hasn’t had the season many expected, as the Huskers are at risk of missing a bowl game, but the administration continues to be confident with Scott Frost.</p>
      <p>The Huskers announced today a two-year extension for the head coach.</p>
      <p>Frost, who’s in his second season, has had his contract extended through the 2026 season.</p>
      <p>“Here to stay,” the Huskers announced.</p>

      <p>Frost, who starred at quarterback for the Huskers, took the Nebraska job after the 2017 season. He went 4-8 in Year 1 and the Huskers are 4-5 this season.</p>
      <p>“Two years ago, we had the tremendous opportunity to bring Scott Frost home to Nebraska to lead our football program into the future.  We are even more committed to that decision today.</p>
      <p>“Coach Frost has shown tremendous leadership in beginning to rebuild our football program.  We appreciate that a change of this nature will not happen overnight.  We are committed to Scott and the direction he is taking this program.</p>
      <p>“Scott is the right coach at the right time for this program.  We are excited for the heights to which he will take Nebraska football and the tremendous impact he will have in the development of our student athletes,” Nebraska’s Ronnie Green and Athletic Director Bill Moos announced in a joint statement.</p>
      <p>Nebraska and Wisconsin are set to kick off at noon E.T.</p>
      <p>The game will be on Big Ten Network.</p>
