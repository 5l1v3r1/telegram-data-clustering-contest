      <p>Clockenflap, Hong Kong's biggest music festival, has been cancelled, organizers said on Friday, the highest-profile event so far to fall victim to the increasingly violent political unrest engulfing the city.</p>
      <p>British folk-rock sensations Mumford &amp; Sons and American star Halsey were among the headliners for the festival this year, which was scheduled for November 22-24.</p>
      <p>"Due to the escalation of the crisis this week, and therefore the uncertainty this creates for the coming weeks, Clockenflap 2019 will be cancelled," the organizers said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Until this week we were fully committed to delivering the festival. Unfortunately, the situation has now made this impossible."</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy protests have escalated in the past week with widespread travel chaos wrought by roadblocks and targeted vandalism of metro stations and lines.</p>
      <p>Violent clashes between police and protesters have left parts of the city debris-strewn.</p>
