        <b>Chukwudi Akasike, Tony Okafor and Femi Dawodu</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are indications that an unidentified corps member has gone missing when thugs attacked a polling unit at Eribo Square, Unit 2, Ward 1, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>Some of the corps member’s colleagues, who were also on election duty, explained that the hoodlums stormed the polling unit around 1.00 p.m. and began to threaten Independent National Electoral Commission officials.</p>
      <p>One of them, who could not immediately give our correspondent the name of the missing corps member said some of them were saved by some agents of a political party.</p>
      <p>The corps members said, ”The party agent was one of those who rescued us from the thugs. But he may have made a mistake by raising his voice when the police were planning to resolve the crisis at hand.”</p>
