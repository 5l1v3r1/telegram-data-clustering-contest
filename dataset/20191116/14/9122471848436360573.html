      <p>One of the biggest games on college football’s Week 12 slate is taking place in Auburn this afternoon. The Tigers are set to host Georgia in a major SEC showdown at Jordan-Hare Stadium.</p>
      <p>The game has serious College Football Playoff implications. The Bulldogs remain in the thick of the race. There are even some who believe Auburn could get into contention if it wins out.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Paul Finebaum has made his pick for the game.</p>
      <p>The college football analyst likes the ‘Dawgs.</p>
      <p>“I like the Dawgs. I think they’ve been a sneaky good team all year,” Finebaum said of Georgia.</p>

      <p>Auburn has lost a couple of close SEC games this season, falling to Florida and LSU earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“I think they’ll lose another,” Finebaum added.</p>
      <p>Auburn and Georgia are set to kick off at 3:30 p.m. E.T. The game will be on CBS.</p>
