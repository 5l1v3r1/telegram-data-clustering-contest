      <p>Little Hunter had been ill in the weeks before his death, going back and forward to the doctor, then spending two nights in hospital with an infection at the end of last month, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/health-illness-baby-death-swansea-17248550">Wales Online</a> reports.</p>
      <p>His 22-year-old mum says he cried uncontrollably and refused food before going to bed in the hours before she found his little body.</p>
      <p>In a post on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/facebook">Facebook</a> Hope, who also has a two-year-old son Leo, said: "You've left a big hole in my heart, my handsome boy. I wished at the time I could have saved you.</p>
      <p>"I tried my best and I hope you know that. I'll always talk about you to Leo who adored you so much. He walks into your room to look in the Moses basket to see if you're there.</p>
      <p>"I just want to hold you and let you how much I love you."</p>

      <p>A close friend of Hope's, Jessica Chambers, is now raising money to pay for Hunter's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/funerals">funeral</a> .</p>
      <p>She said: "Hope is very upset and confused as she still doesn't know how he died. She's trying to stay strong for Leo. I can't even begin to imagine what she's going through at the moment.</p>
      <p>"It's absolutely heartbreaking. I have my own baby the same age as Hunter, so as soon as I found out what had happened I went straight home to hug him."</p>
      <p>Hope, who lives in Portmead, Swansea, is now awaiting the results of a postmortem so she can find out what caused Hunter's death.</p>
      <p>"She was persistent that something wasn't right with him," added Jessica.</p>
      <p>"She wanted to stress that she was very thankful to the police and hospital staff who were wonderful throughout the ordeal."</p>
      <p>Jessica is planning on taking part in a skydive later this year to raise funds for the family.</p>
      <p>"No money will ever change things, but I'm doing this to take some stress off the family at this very difficult time," she added.</p>
      <p>"However big or small, every penny would be appreciated."</p>
