      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:11:44+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Moise Kean has reportedly been offered to AC Milan after a nightmare spell at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> .</p>
      <p>Kean, 19, joined Everton in a £27m deal from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> in the summer but has struggled to adapt to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He hasn't found the net for Everton and was left out of the squad for the clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> after turning up late for a team meeting.</p>
      <p>Everton are not thought to be considering letting him go but reports in Italy suggest he could head back to his homeland.</p>

      <p>Corriere dello Sport claims Kean's agent Mino Raiola has offered the striker to Milan as they look to add to their ranks in January.</p>
      <p>But the Serie A giants are not thought to be convinced by a deal for the teenager.</p>
      <p>A more experienced option is on their radar and Milan could rival <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> for Mario Mandzukic.</p>

      <p>Roma are also interested in Kean, whose father has claimed he made a mistake by moving to Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>"Sending my son to England was a mistake, because he's still too young, he's not feeling good at Everton, I didn't like this transfer," Jean said.</p>
      <p>"At Everton, where he is playing now, he is not settling in well. I think he was supposed to wait a few more years before he had an experience abroad.</p>
      <p>"If there is a possibility for him to come back to Italy, I hope he can do that, so as not to ruin him."</p>
