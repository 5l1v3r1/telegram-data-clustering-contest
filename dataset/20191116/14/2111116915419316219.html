      <p>Thousands of Google Chrome users have been left without service after the company rolled out a new power-saving feature that instead left thousands of users staring at a blank screen.</p>
      <p>As ZDNet explains, the problem was traced back to a feature called 'WebContents Occlusion', which suspends Chrome tabs when you move another window on top of the browser to free up system resources. </p>
      <p>It has been in testing in Chrome Canary and Beta for months, but when Google rolled it out in the stable release the complaints started flooding in.</p>

      <p>The average home user wasn't affected, but businesses running Chrome in virtual machine environments found their staff staring into a white screen of death as their Chrome tabs went blank seemingly at random.</p>
      <p>For companies that rely on web-based tools, and whose IT policies mean they can't simply switch to a different browser, work ground to a halt.</p>
      <p>"Do you see the impact you created for thousands of us without any warning or explanation?" one angry business user posted on <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1024837">the Chrome bug tracker</a>.</p>
      <p>"We are not your test subjects. We are running professional services for multi million dollar programs. Do you understand how many hours of resources were wasted by your 'experiment'? Not acceptable."</p>
      <h4>How to fix it</h4>
      <p>Google has now rolled back the WebContents Occlusion change, and Google software engineer David Bienvenu advised affected users to update and relaunch the browser.</p>
      <p>The update should have reached all users now, but if you're still having problems or haven't received it, you can also solve the problem by visiting chrome://flags and disabling both <b>chrome://flags/#web-contents-occlusion</b> and <b>chrome://flags/#calculate-native-win-occlusion</b>.</p>
      <p>Many IT admins are still unhappy though, and are petitioning Google to let them turn off all experimental flags for Chrome to avoid it happening again.</p>
      <p>"Are we running Beta/Dev/Canary versions of Chromium where those experiments should take place?" asked one user. "No, most of us are on Stable/Enterprise channel, and therefore shouldn't have ours messed with at all."</p>
