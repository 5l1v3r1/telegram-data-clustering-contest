      <p>TORONTO — Canadian National Railways conductors, trainpersons and yardpersons have given strike notice ahead of a Tuesday deadline.</p>
      <p>The union, which represents 3,200 workers, provided the 72-hour notice today as contract negotiations continue over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Teamsters Canada Rail Conference warned in October it was prepared to launch job action after over six months of unsuccessful talks. </p>
      <p>A strike could begin at 12:01 a.m. on Nov. 19 now that the notice has been provided.</p>
      <p>The company says its offer to enter into binding arbitration was declined by the union.</p>
      <p>The workers, who are mostly located in major urban centres across Canada, have been without a contract since July 23.</p>
      <p>This report from The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 16, 2019.</p>
