      <p>There's a new reason to get to the airport early—you might run into a therapy pig who's there to make your trip a little easier. As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-therapy-pig/worlds-first-airport-therapy-pig-hogs-the-limelight-at-san-francisco-airport-idUSKBN1XL1M7">Reuters</a> reports, LiLou the Juliana pig is a member of San Francisco International Airport's "Wag Brigade," a therapy animal program designed to ease stress and anxiety in travelers.</p>
      <p>Aside from her snout and potbelly, LiLou can be recognized by her captain's hat and red "hoof" polish. She spends the day with guests who are happy to take a break from the pressures of traveling. She might comfort them by posing for a selfie, playing a song on her toy keyboard, or offering them a head to pet.</p>
      <p>After bringing joy to people's day, LiLou goes home to her San Francisco apartment where she lives with her owner, Tatyana Danilova. In her free time, she goes on daily walks and snacks on organic vegetables. She even has her own <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilou_sfpig/?hl=en">Instagram account</a>.</p>
      <p>Airports around the world are embracing the benefits therapy animals can bring to customers. The Wag Brigade program at San Francisco includes a number of dogs, and earlier this year, the Aberdeen Airport in Scotland debuted its own "<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/581884/therapy-dogs-comfort-travelers-scotland-aberdeen-airport">canine crew</a>" of dogs trained to make travelers feel safe and happy. Therapy <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/500803/anxious-travelers-can-play-mini-horses-kentucky-airport">miniature horses</a> have even been used at an airport in Kentucky. According to the San Francisco Airport, LiLiou is the world's first airport therapy pig.</p>
