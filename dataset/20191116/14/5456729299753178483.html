      <h1>KogiDecides: Yahaya Bello narrowly defeats Natasha Akpoti in her polling unit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:06:37+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/363507-just-in-kogidecides-yahaya-bello-narrowly-defeats-natasha-akpoti-in-her-polling-unit.html" target="_blank">Nasir Ayitogo</a></address>
      <p>Natasha Akpoti, the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the Kogi election, has been defeated at her polling unit.</p>
      <p>Yahaya Bello, the incumbent governor and APC candidate, secured 78 votes while Ms Akpoti secured 76 votes</p>
      <p>However, the PDP did not record any vote as the election was keenly contested by Mr Bello and Ms Akpoti</p>
      <p>Both Mr Bello and Ms Akpoti are from the same part of the state.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES reported how Ms Akpoti criticised the conduct of the election in her <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/363462-kogidecides-no-real-election-is-going-on-in-kogi-central-natahsa-akpoti-says.html">Kogi Central senatorial district</a>.</p>
      <p>“This is definitely not an election, this is almost like a war zone and the sad thing is military personnel and security agents around there are doing nothing while thugs harass the SDP agents.</p>
      <p>“There is no election happening in Kogi central, so I can imagine what is happening in other parts of the state. The level of violence is unprecedented,” she said after casting her vote.</p>
