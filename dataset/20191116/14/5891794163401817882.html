      <p>Protesters angered by Iran raising subsidized fuel prices blocked traffic in at least a dozen cities and clashed occasionally with police on November 16, the second day of sometimes violent street protests. Mobile-phone footage shows a large crowd of protesters in the city of Kermanshah, which later drew tear-gas fire from police. Protesters were heard chanting: "Police, support us!"</p>
