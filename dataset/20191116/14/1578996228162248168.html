      <h1>Archie Went to a Playgroup With Prince Harry and Was 'Particularly Taken' With Other Redhead Babies</h1>

      <p>At six months old, Archie is starting to go out and socialize with other babies...and already, he feels a kinship with his fellow gingers. <i><a href="https://people.com/royals/prince-harry-takes-archie-to-playgroup-for-the-first-time-with-meghan-markle/">People</a> </i>reports Prince Harry observed it firsthand this week.</p>
      <p>Archie's dad took him to a playgroup near Harry and Meghan Markle's Frogmore Cottage home in Windsor. “There were a couple of other dads there—he wasn’t the only dad there!” an insider told <i>People. </i>And Harry got to witness his son really enjoy himself: “Archie had a fantastic time," the source said. "He was crawling around and was particularly taken with two other red-haired babies. The Duke said: ‘Gingers stick together!’” Truly!</p>
      <p>Meghan and Harry confirmed that <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29476743/meghan-markle-prince-harry-archie-ginger-confirmed/">Archie has red hair</a> in October. The couple was talking to 11-year-old Milly Sutherland and her mother Angela during their WellChild Awards appearance when they dropped the bombshell.</p>
      <p>Angela told <i><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019101579187/meghan-markle-reveals-baby-son-archie-has-started-play-group/">Hello!</a> </i>that they asked if Archie had red hair. "Meghan said he has, and Harry said he definitely is, you can see it in his eyebrows," Angela said. "Harry said he’d had no hair for five months, but Meghan told him she had taken him to the playgroup and she said there were other children there with the same amount of hair or even less."</p>
      <p><i>Us Weekly </i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29710465/meghan-markle-prince-harry-son-archie-6-months-report/">shared a little more detail</a> earlier this month about what Archie is like these days. “He’s a strong baby and you can tell he’s super smart," a source said. "He can sit up without support and roll over, and he’s almost crawling. He can’t talk yet, but he’s trying!”</p>
      <p>The source added that Archie <i>loooooves </i>Harry. “When Harry walks into the room, Archie gets so excited, he puts his arms out—his way of saying, ‘Pick me up!’ You can tell Archie’s going to be a social butterfly. He’s at his happiest when he’s around people.”</p>
