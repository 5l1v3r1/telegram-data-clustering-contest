      <h1>Wanted to expose real face of DDCA through this resignation: Rajat Sharma</h1>
      <h2>Rajat Sharma, who was elected as DDCA president in July last year, said he tried his best to run the controversy-ridden association in a transparent manner.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:56:15+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>Hours after resigning from the post of DDCA President, senior TV journalist Rajat Sharma stated that Delhi cricket body is still a hotbed of petty corruption and hopes that his resignation would send out a stern warning to the stakeholders. He also mentioned that he tried to run the controversy-ridden association in a transparent manner. The journalist took over the position as DDCA President in July last year.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to expose the real face of DDCA through this resignation. Even today, there are people who are in the DDCA for their vested interests, getting contracts and tenders (before an international game) besides interfering in selection matters,” Sharma was quoted by PTI as saying.</p>
      <p>“This (resignation) should set the alarm bells ringing and all stakeholders including Supreme Court, cricketers and BCCI, come to know that such vested interests are still very much at play in the DDCA and it is for them to decide the future course of action. I could have easily stayed on for another two years of my tenure. But I thought I must ring this bell. If I dont resign today, it would be unfair to the members,” he added.</p>
      <p>Along with the president several other officials such as CEO Ravikant Chopra, former players Yashpal Sharma and Sunil Valson, forming the Cricket the Advisory Committee, also resigned.</p>
      <p>The cricket body was expected to finally run without any controversy after it amended its constitution as per Lodha reforms.</p>
      <p>Asked if it is all back to square one for the DDCA, Sharma said: “We did try our best for one and a half years. We fulfilled our promises made to the cricketers, got the professionals to run the association (CEO, CFO, GM operations). We made a system but there are some things which are beyond systems and transparency. It was getting tougher by the day.”</p>
      <p>Sharma also mentioned that he feels relieved after his resignation. “I am relieved because my role became more of a watchdog. I was required to keep a watch on a daily basis, if someone was doing something wrong or involved in corruption. That relief is there but I am concerned at the same time and want to see what the BCCI and Supreme Court do to control these people.”</p>
      <p>Sharma also insisted that despite not being part of the system he still can offer a lot from the outside. “I think I can do better things for DDCA being outside the system. I have been in public life for 35 years, I have a voice and people pay attention to what I say. I am sure my voice will be heard and would be more effective. I feel the power of a DDCA member is more than the president,” he added.</p>
