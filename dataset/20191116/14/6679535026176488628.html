      <p>The 16 life-size paintings of Mahatma Gandhi by artist Amrut M. Sahu is on display at Ideal Fine Art Institution in the city.</p>
      <p>Prof. Sahu from the Architecture Department in the PDA College of Engineering has tried to explain the life history of Gandhiji in his work.</p>
      <p>The artist has focused particularly in terms of his colour usage and that is an intrinsic factor of his work.</p>
      <p>One of the paintings shows how Gandhiji was inspired by the story of Satya Harishchandra that left an indelible impression on his mind.</p>
      <p>Through his paintings, the artist expressed Gandhi’s ideals of truth, simplicity, non-violence and peaceful resistance.</p>
      <p>Another painting compares how modern India has been captured by foreign brands with that of the Swadeshi movement to boycott British products.</p>
      <p>Another one reveals the articles, in stark simplicity, used by Gandhi. A painting of the Dandi March and the one showing how saddened he was by the Partition.</p>
      <p>Another one shows Gandhi taking a group photograph with foreigners that explain how he was revered across the world.</p>
      <p>One shows Gandhi sitting desolately and in the backdrop is a picture of India’s poverty.</p>
      <p>“I worked for every single painting for 2-3 months. It took about five years for me to complete the Mahatma Gandhi series,” Prof. Sahu said.</p>
      <p>In the last four-and-a half-decades, he worked on some 500 works including a series on the theme of ‘rural life of India’, and ‘the cow’.</p>
      <p>He has exhibited his works across the country in the last 25 years and has also received numerous awards from the State and the Union government.</p>
