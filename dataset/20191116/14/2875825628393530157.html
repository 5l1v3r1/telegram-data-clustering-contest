      <h1>Jadon Sancho responds to Man Utd transfer plea from fan after England training</h1>
      <h2>Jadon Sancho has been tipped to leave Borussia Dortmund to join Man Utd - and the transfer rumours were directly addressed by a fan after England training</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:28:35+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>England star Jadon Sancho laughed off a fan begging him to sign for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Sancho, who earned his 11th England cap in Thursday's 7-0 win over Montenegro, took some time to sign autographs and pose for pictures with fans after a training session.</p>
      <p>He was met by a supporter who directly addressed links with Manchester United as the Red Devils prepare for a January bid to bring him back to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Sancho was recently dropped and fined by Borussia Dortmund after returning late from the last international break, prompting hopes at Old Trafford they could convince him to make a Â£100m move.</p>
      <p>"Please sign for United," a brazen supporter begged Sancho after taking a selfie, prompting him to laugh before moving on and diplomatically avoiding the question.</p>

      <p>Sancho has emerged as one of Europe's hottest properties after his breakthrough in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>He was wanted by United last year but their failure to qualify for the Champions League meant a move never materialised.</p>
      <p>But his recent run-ins with Dortmund bosses have led to speculation they could allow him to move on earlier than planned having always been resigned to losing him at some stage in the future.</p>

      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to sign both Sancho and Norwegian striker Erling Braut Haaland when the January transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>Yet he could face competition from Liverpool, who are also known admirers of Sancho and monitoring the situation regarding the England winger.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool star Dietmar Hamann recently told Sky Germany: "What I hear is that <a href="https://talksport.com/football/618576/liverpool-premier-league-title-manchester-city-stuart-pearce/">Liverpool</a> have great interest.</p>

      <p>"I would imagine that next summer they could become one of the biggest interested parties.</p>
      <p>"He's from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and I do not know if he would come back again, and it's a thing for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United,</a> too, if they've ever been to the rivals."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and former club Manchester City have also been linked with bringing Sancho back to the Premier League.</p>
