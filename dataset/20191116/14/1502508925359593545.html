      <p>Armaan Jaffer helped India to 246 all in 50 overs after being put in to bat. Bangladesh cantered to victory in 42.1 overs with Soumya Sarkar, who played for the senior team in the recent T20 series against India, making 73 off 68 balls and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto scoring 94 off 88 balls.</p>
