      <p>Russian-controlled forces are provoking the Ukrainian military to return fire near the Bohdanivka-Petrivske disengagement site, the press center of the Joint Forces Operation reports.</p>
      <p>Despite statements of peaceful initiatives, Russian occupation forces are provoking the disruption of the process of disengagement of forces and assets," reads the report published on Facebook.</p>

This morning, within 30 mintues, Russian invaders fired 82mm mortars and heavy machine guns at the Joint Forces' fortifications near Starohnativka. Fire was opened f from Petrivske's direction," the report says.</p>
      <p>The press center noted that the enemy, by firing from the right and left flank outside the disengagement zone, is provoking the Ukrainian military to return fire, expecting to record shelling within zone No.3.</p>
      <p>"The Russian side further plans to use these records to accuse Ukraine in the world arena of violating the peace process," JFO Command says.</p>
