      <p>We have a very cool behind the scenes video for you to check out from the upcoming film, <b><i>A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood</i></b>, that shows us <b>Tom Hanks</b> making the transformation into the beloved children’s TV star Fred Rogers. It’s really cool to see him make the physical choices in his voice and in his cadence that make the portrayal so special. Every single thing I’ve seen related to this film makes me tear up. <i>Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood </i>is so nostalgic, and Fred Rogers was such a special man that taught children love and kindness across generations unlike any other program on television.</p>
      <p>Enjoy the clip below, and see <i>A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood</i> in theatres November 22, 2019.</p>
