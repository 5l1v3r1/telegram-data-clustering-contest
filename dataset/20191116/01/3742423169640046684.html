      <h1>These Excel Shortcuts Are Actually Useful</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/nick-douglas" target="_blank">Nick Douglas</a></address>
      <p>“How fast can you work in Excel?” asks a viral video that’s been bouncing around the internet for over a year. The animation demonstrates some quality Excel shortcuts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select an entire row with <i>shift+space</i>, a column with <i>ctrl+space</i>.</li>
        <li>Insert the current date with <i>ctrl+;</i> and the current time with <i>ctrl+shift+;</i>.</li>
        <li>Get the sum of a group of cells by selecting all the cells, then hitting <i>alt</i> and <i>+</i>.</li>
        <li>Hide the row you currently have highlighted with <i>ctrl+9</i>, and the current column with <i>ctrl+0</i>. (That’s a zero.)</li>
        <li>To make a line break within one cell, hit <i>alt+enter</i>.</li>
        <li>To see all the formulae in your spreadsheet, inside their cells, hit <i>ctrl+`</i>. (That’s the accent grave key, aka the tilde key, in the top left.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The hacks start two minutes into this video, an hour long, brain-rotting compilation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKOJhC-CcUs">“THE ULTIMATE IQ TEST, POPULAR RIDDLES, EMOJI CHALLENGE AND BRAIN TEASERS.”</a></p>

      <p>The animation bounced around various channels and platforms and landed at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/dttrao/60_seconds_of_excel_shortcuts_that_i_wish_i_knew/">the Lifehacks subreddit</a>, finally freed from its compilation prison and brought to its proper audience. Happy spreadsheeting.</p>
