      <h1>Bolivia crisis: a coup... or simple return to rule of law?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:20:12+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:20</time> by <a rel="author">Barnaby CHESTERMAN (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>Even before Bolivia's Evo Morales quit the presidency in response to weeks of violent protest over his re-election, leftist allies were denouncing what they called a coup.</p>
      <p>From Britain's opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to allies Cuba and Venezuela, the president's weekend departure has been characterized as an illegal power grab.</p>
      <p>Accused of election fraud, he fled for Mexico after his resignation as right wing opposition senator Jeanine Anez prepared to declare herself acting president.</p>
      <p>Stretching back to 1970s Chile and Argentina, Latin America has a dark history of right-wing coups that have left millions acutely suspicious of foreign influence and anti-democratic domestic forces.</p>
      <p>The intervention of armed forces chief Williams Kaliman in suggesting Morales step down lends credence to the idea that Bolivia's power shift follows the pattern.</p>
      <p>But Maria Teresa Zegada, a political scientist at San Simon University in the central Bolivian city of Cochabamba, says the events lack several elements that are typical of coups.</p>
      <p>"It implies the substitution of one group in government for another," Zegada, who specializes in social movements, told AFP by telephone.</p>
      <p>"In Bolivia's case, this hasn't happened."</p>
      <p>While Anez has assumed the role of interim president, she has repeatedly stressed that she aims to hold new elections in short order.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old didn't stand in the October 20 general election and has given no indication she intends to put herself forward in any future poll.</p>
      <p>- Restoring constitutionality -</p>
      <p>Another feature of coups is that they "have to break the constitutional order," said Zegada.</p>
      <p>"In this case it's the opposite... this interim government is trying to restore constitutionality."</p>
      <p>Morales's standing in the election was itself a controversial issue as Bolivia's constitution limits presidents to two consecutive terms, while Morales was seeking a fourth.</p>
      <p>He had lost a 2016 referendum in which he tried to remove term limits but a year later Bolivia's highest legal authority -- the constitutional court -- ruled against the constitution.</p>
      <p>A coup also involves a power grab, usually by the military or an individual backed by the armed forces.</p>
      <p>"What's the objective of this (interim) government? It's mission is basically to bring back peace to Bolivia and call elections as soon as possible," said Zegada.</p>
      <p>Even the military itself is not acting as if it is involved in a coup, she added.</p>
      <p>"The police and armed forces are there to bring peace to the streets," Zegada said.</p>
      <p>Another controversy centers around the legitimacy of Anez's constitutional court-backed claim to be interim president.</p>
      <p>She found herself next in line after the resignations of the only government figures more senior than her -- Morales, the vice-president, the Senate president and the lower house speaker.</p>
      <p>Former Senate president and Morales loyalist Adriana Salvatierra has claimed she should take charge since she says her resignation was never formally accepted by the Senate.</p>
      <p>"Salvatierra's reaction is a bit too late because she had already resigned verbally and sought refuge in an embassy," said Zegada.</p>
      <p>- 'There was a coup' -</p>
      <p>Movement for Socialism, the populist, indigenist party led by Morales, is attempting to wrest back control after a raft of politicians and governors followed Morales out the door -- many seeking refuge in foreign embassies from angry mobs.</p>
      <p>Zegada, though, says it may be too little too late to claw back power.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be difficult for the Movement for Socialism to change this situation," she said.</p>
      <p>As for the accusations of a coup, for Zegada, that's nothing more than hot air.</p>
      <p>"It's a diversionary tactic that the Movement for Socialism is using to gain media attention," she said.</p>
      <p>According to one of Morales's main regional detractors, it's something that has been seen before.</p>
      <p>"The word 'coup' is used a lot when the left loses," said Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
      <p>For Luis Almagro, secretary general of the Organization of American States that audited the October 20 election, there was a coup -- just not the one Morales backers are claiming.</p>
      <p>"Yes, there was a coup d'etat in Bolivia," he said. "It happened on October 20 when there was electoral fraud."</p>
