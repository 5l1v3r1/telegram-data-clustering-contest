      <h1>Everyone On Twitter Thinks Scott Morrison Has Gone Missing, So Now It’s Become A Big Meme</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:40:11+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:40</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Scott Morrison has been pretty present over the last few weeks — at least in a physical sense.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister has appeared in front of cameras countless times to <a href="https://junkee.com/nsw-bushfires-scott-morrison/228886">offer his “thoughts and prayers” to those affected by the NSW bushfires</a>, smiling at the press and dropping vague, useless commiserations.</p>
      <p>Of course, who knows where he’s actually been ethically or politically. The man is a walking suit filled with dandruff, and the day we see him take any kind of stance on any kind of issue will be the day we all die of shock.</p>
      <p>So maybe it’s that moral invisibility that has spawned a curious new conspiracy theory-turned-meme on Twitter — that Scott Morrison has gone missing.</p>
      <p>The first person to share the story appears to be Aaron Dodd, a “small business owner” and <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronDodd">regular political commentator on Twitter.</a></p>

      <p>Of course, Dodd had no obvious connection to any insiders that might know whether or not the Prime Minister has gone missing.</p>
      <p>There was no reason to believe him, so there was no reason to be surprised when, a mere five hours later, a photo of the Prime Minister being very much not disappeared was shared to Twitter.</p>
      <p>In fact, there’s not even reason to believe that he was being serious, rather than just joking about our PM’s <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/former-fire-chief-calls-out-pm-over-refusal-of-meeting/11705330">dubious ethical standing when it comes to the bushfires ravaging NSW.</a></p>

      </figure>
      <p>But that’s kinda beside the point. Whether he meant to or not, Dodd kicked off a massive meme on Twitter — one equating Morrison with Harold Holt, the Prime Minister who famously disappeared into the ocean.</p>
      <p>Within hours, some were seriously pondering the whereabouts of the Prime Minister, while others were getting in on the fun with satirical memes. Before too long, the hashtag #WheresScotty started — and not long after that, it took off.</p>

      <p>All in all, this is a rare meme: one that speaks to an ethical, rather than actual truth. Cause even when Scott Morrison comes back properly, we all know he won’t really be back — not in the way a Prime Minister should be.</p>
