      <h1>Consumer Reports Restores 'Recommended' Ratings to Both Tesla's Model 3 and Model S</h1>

      <p>"Consumer Reports has restored its coveted 'recommended' rating to the Tesla Model S and Model 3, because Tesla has made its cars more reliable," reports CNN: <i>"The Tesla Model 3 struggled last year as the company made frequent design changes and ramped up production to meet demand," said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at CR. "But as the production stabilized, we have seen <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/tesla-consumer-reports/index.html">improvements to the reliability of the Model 3 and S that now allow us to recommend both models</a>."<br/><br/>Although Consumer Reports says the Models S and 3 need fewer repairs, it did have some bad news for Tesla, too: The Model X SUV continues to rank among the magazine's least reliable.</i> <br/>The Model S had lost its recommended status last year, CNN notes. And while initially giving Tesla's Model 3 a "recommended" rating in 2018, further reliability survey data from more Tesla owners had prompted Consumer Reports to <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/02/21/2214217/consumer-reports-no-longer-recommends-the-tesla-model-3">remove it from its recommended list in February of this year</a>.<br/><br/>The new ratings are just part of a good month for Tesla. Since <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/10/24/0126242/tesla-returns-to-profitability-smashes-analyst-estimates">reporting an unexpected profit last month</a>, Tesla's stock price has shot up more than 40%.</p>
