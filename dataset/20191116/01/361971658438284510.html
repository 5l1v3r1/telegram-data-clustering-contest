      <p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33793-kodak-black/">Kodak Black</a> is facing additional legal trouble in Florida related to weapons charges he faced earlier this year. According to the <i><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237408344.html">Miami Herald</a></i>, state prosecutors have charged the rapper with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Each charge carries up to a 30-year prison sentence. Pitchfork has contacted the rapper’s legal team for comment.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday (November 13), Kodak was <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-sentenced-to-nearly-4-years-in-prison-on-federal-weapons-charges/">sentenced to 46 months in prison</a> for lying about his criminal history while trying to buy firearms. He was <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-arrested-at-rolling-loud-festival-on-weapons-charges-report/">arrested in mid-May</a> on his way to the Rolling Loud festival, and after having his bond revoked, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-pleads-guilty-to-federal-weapons-charges/">pleaded guilty</a> to the federal charges in August. While trying to buy a gun on two separate occasions, the rapper had indicated on paperwork that he was not under a current indictment. However, he was out on bond from <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-indicted-on-sexual-assault-charges-report/">sexual assault charges</a> levied against him in South Carolina three years ago when the purchases happened.</p>
      <p>Before his Miami arrest, Kodak was <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-arrested-at-us-border-on-drug-and-gun-charges/">apprehended at the U.S./Canada border</a> in April for possession of marijuana and a weapon. In January 2018, he was arrested on <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-arrested-on-weapon-and-child-neglect-charges/">child neglect and weapons charges</a>. Those were dropped <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-blacks-lawyer-claims-guns-drugs-in-instagram-arrest-were-fake/">a month later</a>, but the rapper served time in the Broward County Jail until August 2018 for <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-released-from-jail/">related probation-violation charges</a>.</p>
