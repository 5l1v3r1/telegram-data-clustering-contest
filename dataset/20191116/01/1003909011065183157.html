      <h1>Parents 'bracing themselves' for higher school fees, more fundraising</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:20:31+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:20</time> by <a rel="author">Yolande Cole</a></address>
      <p>Parents are “bracing themselves” for impacts to students and families following a Calgary Board of Education meeting this week focused on budget cuts, the spokesperson for an advocacy group said Friday.</p>
      <p>Barbara Silva, communications director for Support Our Students, said parents have already noticed some of the effects of reduced spending, such as principals sending out messages about freezing expenditures.</p>
      <p>“We already are feeling some of the trickle effects of the budget cuts and knowing now that there’s going to be staffing cuts in January, parents are bracing themselves,” Silva said. “They know that this is going to translate to higher fees, higher transportation costs and a greater dependency on fundraising.”</p>
      <p>Calgary Board of Education administration presented the board of trustees with an updated fall budget assumptions report Thursday, given a $32-million budget gap announced by the CBE following the provincial budget on Oct. 24. The updated report outlined areas in which the CBE plans to find budget reductions of about $48 million in annualized savings to balance the budget over the rest of the 2019-2020 school year.</p>
      <p>Those areas include cutting the overall funding allocated to 246 schools by $22 million, or 2.5 per cent, the CBE said. That will mean some temporary employee contracts will be eliminated and some central and area-based staff will be redeployed to schools.</p>
      <p>Cuts worth two to 10 per cent will be made to overall administration through service unit reductions, the CBE said, and a reduction to planned capital spending to the tune of $5 million will also take place.</p>
      <p>Due to the elimination of $8 million in provincial transportation funding, there will be an increase in fees mid-year for students who ride school buses.</p>
      <p>Silva said school spending has got to the point of “nickel and diming” following a first round of cuts made by principals in anticipation of the provincial budget.</p>
      <p>“But it wasn’t enough, and so we are now down to absolute bare bones,” Silva said.</p>
      <p>CFO Brad Grundy said parents and students will see impacts in terms of class size.</p>
      <p>“When you take educators out of the system, you obviously will impact class size,” he said.</p>
      <p>Reductions to service units, which provide a range of programs, services and supports into the school system, will also have impacts, he added.</p>
      <p>Grundy said while there will be an increase in transportation fees, there are waiver processes in place to ensure a way to and from school is still available for families who don’t have the ability to pay the increased fees.</p>
      <p>“So there will absolutely be impacts, but that’s part and parcel of finding $32 million in the middle of the school year,” he said.</p>
      <p>Following Thursday’s meeting, administration will be working with principals and education directors to figure out what the cuts will look like in schools.</p>
      <p>“All of our service units are currently going through the process of identifying what their reductions are going to be,” he said. “We’ll evaluate those as a system … so there’s a lot of balancing and management that’s required.”</p>
      <p>An update to the board of trustees is expected around Dec. 10.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to move expeditiously, but I think for students and families in Calgary, they need to know that the Calgary Board of Education remains absolutely committed to providing a top-notch public education within the available resources,” he said.</p>
      <p>Board of trustees chair Marilyn Dennis’s voice was filled with emotion when she said at the conclusion of Thursday’s meeting she is confident the CBE will do its best with every dollar it has, but that “these will not be easy choices that we’re making.”</p>
      <p>“We’re going to be asking more of our educators and more of every single staff member that is part of the Calgary Board of Education,” she said.</p>
      <p>Dennis thanked all CBE staff “for how they’ve dedicated themselves and their lives every day to making a difference in the lives of the students that walk into our schools.”</p>
