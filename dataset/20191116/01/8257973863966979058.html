      <h1>Philadelphia Eagles sign RB Jay Ajayi after Darren Sproles injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author">Connor Grott</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Philadelphia-Eagles/?tps=1">Philadelphia Eagles</a> brought back veteran running back <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jay-Ajayi/?tps=1">Jay Ajayi</a> after a season-ending injury to <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Darren_Sproles/?tps=1">Darren Sproles</a>.</p>
      <p>The Eagles <a href="https://twitter.com/Eagles/status/1195463453290455040">announced</a> Friday that the team signed Ajayi and placed Sproles on injured reserve due to a torn right hip flexor. Financial details of Ajayi's agreement weren't disclosed.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old Sproles, who surpassed Hall of Fame receiver <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tim_Brown/?tps=1">Tim Brown</a> on the NFL's all-purpose yards list this season, said Friday on social media that it could be the end of his career after 15 seasons in the league.</p>
      <p>"Man what a ride," Sproles wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B45rZFtlysE/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Instagram</a>. "I put my all in this game since the age of 8. I played every snap like it was my last. If I never put that #43 on again I have no regrets I gave it my all and I hope I made my family proud!"</p>
      <p>Ajayi, who joined Philadelphia midway through the 2017 season, hasn't played since last October, when he sustained a torn ACL while playing for the Eagles. After the 2018 campaign, the team opted against re-signing the running back, making him a free agent.</p>

      <p>Along with Sproles, starting running back <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jordan-Howard/?tps=1">Jordan Howard</a> is dealing with an injury. He has yet to be cleared for contact because of a shoulder stinger, putting his status for Sunday's matchup against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New_England_Patriots/?tps=1">New England Patriots</a> in question.</p>
      <p>Howard is listed as questionable on the team's official injury report. The Eagles already ruled out receiver <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Alshon-Jeffery/?tps=1">Alshon Jeffery</a> and linebacker Nigel Bradham due to ankle injuries.</p>
      <p>The Eagles will play the Patriots on Sunday before hosting the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Seattle-Seahawks/?tps=1">Seattle Seahawks</a> on Nov. 24.</p>
