      <p>Two students were killed and three others were injured on Thursday when a 16-year-old gunman opened fire at his California high school and then shot himself in the head, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alex Villanueva of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LosAngelesCountySheriffsDepartment/videos/577505062994699/?v=577505062994699">told reporters</a> that first responders arrived at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita around 7:40 a.m. and discovered six people with gunshot wounds in the quad. They were treated at the scene and then transported to local hospitals, he said.</p>
      <p>One of the injured people turned out to be the suspect, who was in “grave” condition but was being treated at a hospital, Villanueva said. He described the suspect as an Asian male who was a student at Saugus High School. The suspect died on Friday, police told the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>Villanueva said police executed a search warrant at the suspect’s residence.</p>
      <p>Capt. Kent Wegener said Thursday was the suspect’s 16th birthday.</p>

      <p>Wegener told reporters that the weapon was a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol that had “no more rounds in it” by the time authorities discovered it. Video from the incident reviewed by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department showed the suspect drawing the handgun from his backpack and shooting several students before he turned the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>Wegener said the motive for the shooting was unclear. He added that the suspect’s girlfriend and mother were at the sheriff’s station speaking with detectives.</p>
      <p>Two of the victims, a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy, died. Their identities haven’t been released.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the other victims, a 14-year-old girl, a 15-year-old girl, and a 14-year-old boy, were in <a href="https://twitter.com/SCVSHERIFF/status/1195114706110803968">stable condition</a> as of 3 p.m. local time.</p>

      <p>Melissa Santillan, a 15-year-old sophomore, <a href="https://www.insider.com/saugus-shooting-santa-clarita-students-describe-what-happened-2019-11">told Insider</a> she arrived at school around 7:40 a.m. to the sight of crowds of students running away.</p>
      <p>She said she and her friends still don’t know who was shot.</p>
      <p>“All my friends get to school early, and I called my best friend, and all I heard was him running for his life, saying he was OK and he was running to safety,” Santillan said. “That will forever scare me and all my peers.”</p>

      <p>The Santa Clarita sheriff’s station said there was <a href="https://twitter.com/SCVSHERIFF/status/1195024358768443392">only one suspect</a>.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles County Undersheriff Tim Murakami said <a href="https://twitter.com/LASDMurakami/status/1195043472987713536">every student</a> at the school would be interviewed before being released to their parents.</p>
      <p>“We need to conduct a thorough investigation,” Murakami said. “Why every student? They could either be a witness, provide important information about the shooter or a possible motive.”</p>
      <p>Photos and videos showed students evacuating the building, holding their arms above their heads.</p>
