      <h1>Inaugural Green Line committee meeting shows council divided</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:31:11+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:31</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>It was a meeting that was supposed to “set the tone” and bolster public confidence in the city’s largest infrastructure project, but Friday’s inaugural gathering of the Green Line committee saw council members more divided than ever on the $4.9-billion transit project.</p>
      <p>Coun. Shane Keating began the meeting with an appeal to his colleagues to “stop the churn” and “focus” on finalizing the route for Stage 1.</p>
      <p>“It is the responsibility of this committee to bring confidence and credibility back to the Green Line project,” exhorted Keating. “We must cease and desist from criticizing administration as we move forward and we must work together as a committee.”</p>
      <p>But within moments of Keating’s opening remarks, city councillors were arguing in circles over public engagement and bickering over the wording of a proposal from Coun. Jeff Davison to establish new terms to guide the Green Line project.</p>
      <p>A controversial part of Davison’s pitch was the suggestion that the city should consider “options to split the line” to avoid crossing the existing downtown transit mall along 7 Avenue S.W. — a move that would effectively quash the original vision for a single north-south line with a tunnel beneath the downtown.</p>
      <p>Committee members couldn’t come to an agreement on Davison’s proposal and opted instead to refer it back to city staff for further work — but not before Coun. Evan Woolley was asked to apologize for telling his colleague, Coun. Jyoti Gondek, that she didn’t “have to be so livid all the time” during a particularly heated exchange.</p>
      <p>Woolley apologized and the meeting continued under a cloud of tension, with Coun. Druh Farrell lamenting at one point, “I don’t know how this committee is going to accomplish anything, frankly, based on the last two and a half hours.”</p>

      <p>Committee members also heard Friday that several large downtown property owners are concerned about a reconfigured route with more of the train travelling at-surface through the core — particularly about the possibility of a level crossing at Macleod Trail.</p>
      <p>In a letter passed to committee and signed by companies including Anthem, Brookfield and Oxford Properties, the group said it was concerned that a surface alignment would “negatively impact building values and further depress rental rates.”</p>
      <p>The group called the project “fundamental” to expanding transportation options for downtown workers, residents and visitors and said it continued to support an “all-underground line” that wouldn’t negatively impact the urban realm.</p>
      <p>Project staff warned several months ago that <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/council-set-to-debate-pause-on-calgarys-4-9-billion-green-line-project">they were no longer recommending a tunnel under the Bow River or deep underground downtown stations</a>. The deep stations were viewed as too inaccessible and the deep-bore tunnel as likely to increase the risk of cost overruns. It’s not yet known how much of the four-kilometre route through the centre city will be at-grade.</p>
      <p>Green Line general manager Michael Thompson emphasized Friday no decision has been made on the train’s alignment.</p>
      <p>Thompson said committee members will get the chance to see all of the options on the table regarding a route through the downtown core at a meeting on Dec. 17.</p>
      <p>A decision could then be made on the final alignment at committee in January, followed by a vote to ratify the plan in council.</p>
      <p>The city is also in talks with the province to sort out the impact of the Alberta government’s decision to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/city-turns-to-ottawa-as-uncertainty-swirls-around-green-line-funding">delay $480 million in Green Line funding over the next four years</a>. City officials have said the delay will likely require the city to reconfigure plans and staging for the $4.9-billion project.</p>
