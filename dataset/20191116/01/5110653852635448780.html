      <p>It appears Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph will not take Browns defensive end Myles Garrett to court after Garrett took Rudolph's helmet off his head and hit Rudolph with itin the closing seconds of their game Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Ian Rapoport of NFL Network <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1195491413124952066">tweeted Friday night</a> that Rudolph considers the incident "to be exclusively an NFL matter" and thus will not take legal action against Garrett.</p>

The league also reportedly fined Rudolph, although it has not announced that punishment. Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey (three games) and Browns lineman Larry Ogunjobi (one game) were also suspended for their roles in the brawl that Garrett and Rudolph sparked. The Browns and Steelers were each fined $250,000.</p>
