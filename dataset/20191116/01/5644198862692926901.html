      <p>SHANGHAI:Â Formed in the Hangzhou flat of co-founder Jack Ma in 1999, Alibaba has ridden the seemingly insatiable Chinese appetite for online shopping to become one of the world's most valuable companies.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the US-listed company confirmed plans to add its value further, but listing additional shares in Hong Kong in an offering worth around US$13 billion.</p>

      <p>Here are the answers to key questions about the company:</p>
      <p>
        <b>HOW DID ALIBABA START?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ma, a former English teacher who claims to have never written a line of computer code, had dabbled in various ventures with mixed success before friends introduced him to the internet while on a 1990s trip to the United States.</p>
      <p>With Amazon already making waves in online shopping, Ma convinced a group of Chinese and foreign friends to front US$60,000 in 1999 for a business-to-business e-commerce venture.</p>
      <p>Ma dubbed it "Alibaba" because the name is easily pronounced in virtually any language, including Chinese, and because the "open sesame" catchphrase signified that its platforms "open a doorway to fortune for small businesses", according to the company.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHY HAS IT BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alibaba was founded at a time when Chinese incomes were soaring after decades of rapid economic growth and the country was becoming increasingly digitalised.</p>
      <p>That allowed Alibaba to easily facilitate commerce between consumers increasingly hooked on the ease of online shopping, and the country's countless manufacturers of cheap goods.</p>
      <p>Today, China has the world's largest online population - in excess of 850 million - most of them smartphone users deeply immersed in the country's growing digital ecosystem and e-commerce.</p>
      <p>The business generated by Alibaba's own mobile monthly active users - which reached 785 million in the most recent financial latest quarter - propelled rapid growth, and in September 2014, the company listed on Wall Street, raising US$25 billion in what remains the largest IPO ever.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHAT DOES IT DO?</b>
      </p>
      <p>E-commerce remains the company's bread and butter, conducted mainly via its largely consumer-to-consumer Taobao site and the more business-to-consumer Tmall, and typically paid for via its digital-payments unit Alipay, which has become a pioneer in that sector.</p>
      <p>Through Alibaba's platforms, Chinese consumers can buy a wide array of products from clothing to electronics, food, luxury products and even more unusual goods - including Boeing 747 cargo planes.</p>
      <p>But Alibaba's success has seen it invest heavily in new business lines as well.</p>
      <p>It owns leading Chinese video streaming website Youku, and its Alibaba Pictures unit in 2016 bought a stake in Steven Spielberg's Amblin Partners, which owns DreamWorks Pictures, among other entertainment ventures.</p>
      <p>It also is investing in cloud computing and other aspects of China's growing digital ecosystem including the acquisition of Chinese food-delivery leader Ele.me.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HOW BIG IS IT?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alibaba is now the most valuable public Chinese company, with a market capitalisation of around US$477 billion as of this week, and one of the top-10 most valuable in the world, though still trailing US e-commerce counterpart Amazon, which is worth around US$870 billion.</p>
      <p>Alibaba now claims nearly 104,000 employees at its headquarters in Ma's hometown of Hangzhou in China's eastern province of Zhejiang, but also around China and overseas.</p>
      <p>The company has in recent years taken steps to go global, primarily in Southeast Asia where it runs the Lazada e-commerce platform.</p>
