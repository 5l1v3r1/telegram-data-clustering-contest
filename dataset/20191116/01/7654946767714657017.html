      <p>The second teen who was killed in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/police-responding-to-report-of-school-shooting-in-california/">Saugus High School shooting</a> on Thursday was identified by Los Angeles County authorities as 14-year-old Dominic Blackwell.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner confirmed Blackwell and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/santa-clarita-shooting-gracie-anne-muehlberger-identified-as-a-victim/">15-year-old Gracie Anne Muehlberger</a> were the two victims slain Thursday morning at the Santa Clarita high school by alleged shooter Nathaniel Berhow.</p>
      <p>Dominic was remembered by a friend as a football player who played on a local youth team, <a href="https://abc7.com/saugus-high-shooting-coroner-ids-2-teens-killed-by-classmate/5699580/">ABC Los Angeles reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage captured the suspect, who also attended the school, walking onto the campusâ€™ quad, pulling a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol from his backpack and shooting five fellow students before turning the gun on himself, police officials said.</p>
      <p>A 15-year-old girl who was shot in the hip and a 14-year-old girl shot in her shoulder and lower abdomen remained hospitalized, but were both expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>CBS News in Los Angeles <a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/11/15/saugus-high-school-shooter-nathan-berhow-had-girlfriend-honor-roll-track-team/">reported Friday night</a> that the shooter has died of his self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. His motive remains unclear.</p>
