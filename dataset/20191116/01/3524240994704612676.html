        <b>Olaleye Aluko, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The National Examinations Council has approved the dismissal of 70 of its workers over certificate forgery.</p>
      <p>The NECO Governing Board carried out the dismissal, according to a statement  by the body’s  Head of Information and Public Relations Division, Azeez Sani, on Friday,  after a report on certificate verification was carried out by the management committee.</p>
      <p>The committee had invited the workers with allegedly questionable credentials to appear before them, after which some of them reportedly confessed that their credentials  were fake.</p>
      <p>The council noted that the dismissal was the first phase in the series of the ongoing staff certificate verification.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, the committee also contacted the institutions the affected workers claimed to have attended only to  be  told  that they didn’t know them.</p>
      <p>Sani said, “The  Governing Board vetted the report and approved the dismissal of the affected staff.”</p>
