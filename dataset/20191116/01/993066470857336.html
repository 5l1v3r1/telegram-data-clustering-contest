      <p>Nominations have now closed and we can expect intensified campaigning in what could prove to be the most significant Westminster election of recent times.</p>
      <p>The outcome of the December 12 poll could determine the future direction of Brexit with far-reaching economic and political implications for people living on this island.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson goes into this election seeking a clear majority that will allow him to pass the withdrawal deal he agreed with the EU last month and move on to the next stage, trade negotiations.</p>
      <p>While his chances have improved since Nigel Farage rowed back from his pledge to stand in every constituency, the presence of Brexit Party candidates in some of the Labour Leave-voting areas could prove a problem as the Tories need to take some of these seats.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Farage looks less of a threat generally as his intervention so far has been less assured than in previous campaigns.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson would like the contest to be defined as being one between him and Jeremy Corbyn, who should be in a strong position but leads a deeply divided party.</p>
      <p>The allegations of anti-Semitism within sections of Labour are a problem for him as is the lack of a single clear message on Brexit.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of Tories attacking Mr Corbyn, indeed that is to be expected in what could be a particularly vicious campaign.</p>
      <p>But what is remarkable is the number of Labour candidates who are speaking out publicly against their leader with some former MPs even advocating that people vote for Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>All this suggests we are in for a very unusual election and it could be hard to predict what will happen given that the normal voting patterns are unlikely to apply.</p>
      <p>In Northern Ireland the central issue of EU withdrawal has galvanised Remain parties to the extent that we are seeing what are effectively pacts in key constituencies in a bid to maximise anti-Brexit representation.</p>
      <p>For the DUP, this issue is plainly one that it prefers not to dwell on too much.</p>
      <p>The subject of Brexit is not even referenced in the party's first election broadcast, an incredible omission in the circumstances.</p>
      <p>It may be that the DUP, now warning of a threat to the Union, has belatedly realised that the majority in Northern Ireland who voted Remain called it right in 2016.</p>
