      <h1>Billionaire Jack Ma of Bitcoin-Friendly Alibaba Says US and China Should Share Technology</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:10:02+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Tech titan Jack Ma, the co-founder of China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba, says the US and China should work together instead of creating more problems.</p>
      <p>Alibaba just showed its collaborative stripes and retail power on November 11th by hosting Singles Day, the largest one-day shopping event in the world that <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/11/12/bitcoin-milestone-on-chinas-singles-day-alibaba-supports-btc-rewards-spotlights-taylor-swift-and-smashes-sales/">broke records</a>.</p>
      <p>The company showcased multinational brands, lit up an entertainment extravaganza touting Taylor Swift and launched a new partnership offering Bitcoin rewards for online shoppers.</p>
      <p>In a new interview with Bloomberg, Ma cautions, however, that the political differences between the world’s two largest economies are setting them on course for a 20-year rift.</p>
      <p>Says Ma,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“If we do not handle it carefully, the trade war might not be [lasting for 20 years, but] USA and China relationship might be in some turbulence for the next 20 years. It may last. We have to be very, very careful. I think it’s so important for China and the USA, two great countries, to work together, to support economy, keep people prosperity, share a lot of technology together.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>For so many years China and US have been working together. There’s a problem. That’s very natural. If there’s no problem, that’s not natural, right? So when there are problems, we have to solve the problems. We should not create more problems.”</i>

      <p>Ma sets a high bar. While Singles Day broke records, he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/jack-ma-alibaba-singles-day-sales-missed-expectations.html">says</a> it fell short of his expectation. In the future, the billionaire hopes that the Chinese government will give people a half-day off of work for the big retail event.</p>
