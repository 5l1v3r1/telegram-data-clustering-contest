      <h3>Tony Akowe, Lokoja</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>THE Minority caucus of the House of Representatives on Friday deplored the attack on the hotel in Lokoja housing Governor Seyi Makinde and the PDP governorship candidate in Kogi State, Musa Wada, by hooded gunmen dressed in police uniform.</p>
      <p>The group said the development portends grave danger for the nation’s democracy.</p>
      <p>The House Minority Leader, Mr. Ndudi Elumelu, said in a statement that such attacks are unacceptable.</p>
      <p>He appealed to all contestants in the election to play by the rules and ensure a hitch-free electoral process.</p>
      <p>He said: “We received with grave concern the news of the invasion of the hotel housing the Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Seyi Makinde, by hooded persons, who appeared in police uniform.</p>
      <p>“This development, which has been confirmed by the Commissioner of Police for Kogi State, Mr. Kakeem Busari, is particularly worrisome, coming on the heels of the Wednesday gun attack on PDP campaign rally in Nembe, Bayelsa, resulting in the death of many party faithful, is a clear indication that our democracy is in grave danger.</p>
      <p>“We condemn this brigandage, unprovoked assault, and act of intimidation in the strongest terms possible. Sanctity of the ballot box is the hallmark of democracy. Thus, these barbaric attacks can only be perpetrated by political villains and desperados, who are bent on truncating the people’s will and robbing them of their mandate with the barrels of the gun.</p>

      <p>“The successive signals of violence emanating from Bayelsa and Kogi clearly show that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is not prepared for a free and fair election and is rather bent on visiting war on the peace-loving people of these states.</p>
      <p>“We reject every attempt to turn the Saturday election to a festival of blood of the innocent. But we urge the people of Kogi State not to be intimidated or deterred in the struggle to establish their will at the polls.”</p>
      <p>Elumelu asked INEC and the security agencies to be upright in performing their duties.</p>
      <p>He said: “The onus is on the security agencies to ensure that the people of Kogi as well as Bayelsa cast their ballots in a secure atmosphere free of all forms of intimidation, physical harm, and fear for their lives.</p>
      <p>“Let us also remind INEC and the security agencies that their conducts in these elections will be a subject of far-reaching legislative enquiry.</p>
      <p>“They must, therefore, play by the rule and be at their professional best to ensure that the people vote and that their votes count.”</p>
