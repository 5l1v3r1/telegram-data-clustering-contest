      <p>ULSTER Unionist leader Steve Aiken has declined to state categorically whether or not he approached former chief constable Sir George Hamilton to stand as a Westminster candidate in North Down.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed the "top-tier of the UUP" and others approached the former PSNI head to explore the possibility of him contesting the seat.</p>
      <p>The approaches are said to have taken place before Lady Sylvia Hermon, North Down MP since 2001, withdrew from the Westminster race earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The claims came from veteran journalist Brian Rowan, who himself stood in the constituency as an independent in the 2007 assembly election.</p>
      <p>Mr Rowan said his claims have not been not been challenged by Sir George.</p>
      <p>Quizzed about the approach on BBC's The View, Mr Aiken said he had known the former chief constable for a "long time" and that the two had had "many private conversations" in which the pair had discussed a "range of issues".</p>
      <p>"There was only ever one candidate in the frame for North Down and that was Alan Chambers," the UUP leader said.</p>
      <p>Mr Aiken also defended his criticism of Queen's University academic Professor Colin Harvey, who has carried out research on constitutional change.</p>
      <p>The South Antrim MLA claimed that there was an absence unionist academics at the university countering nationalist voices.</p>
      <p>He described Queen's as a "cool place"for unionists.</p>
