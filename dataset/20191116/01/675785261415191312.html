      <p>A six-year-old girl discovered her fatally injured father underwater with a broken neck.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Massandy died three days after the freak accident at a public swimming pool.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old's daughter Bobbie told swimmers that her dad was in trouble when she realised he hadn't surfaced after doing a penguin dive.</p>
      <p>It is not completely clear how Mr Massandy broke his neck as Bobbie was the only one who witnessed the accident.</p>
      <p>Mr Massandy, from Perth, Australia, died after on November 6 after spending three days on a life support machine.</p>

      <p>His partner Sare Prijit, who is also mum to Bobbie and her sibling Ajay, told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7688497/Father-29-died-freak-pool-accident-discovered-six-year-old-daughter.html">MailOnline</a> : "All I've been able to get out of my daughter at the moment is that they were playing.</p>
      <p>"He was teaching her how to penguin dive - when you squat and put your hands together in front of your head and then fall into the water. </p>
      <p>"Then she said 'Daddy didn't come back up'."  </p>
      <p>It is not clear how long Mr Massandy spent under the water before Bobbie was able to alert a female swimmer, who in turn called for a life guard.</p>

      <p>The landscaping business owner had gone to the pool alone with his daughter - a favourite activity of the pair.</p>
      <p>His partner drove from their home to the pool to pick them up, only to hear the voice of a stranger when she called his mobile.</p>
      <p>Ms Prijit went inside the pool to find attempts being made to resuscitate Mr Massandy.</p>
      <p>After he was rushed to hospital, where doctors discovered he had severed his spinal cord, the dad was put on life support.</p>
      <p>Three days later his family made the decision to turn it off.</p>

      <p>"She's only talked once voluntarily about the incident but every now and then she'll mention something that makes her think of him," Ms Prijit said of her daughter.</p>
      <p>"I keep telling her it's okay if you want to be sad. She's just an amazing little girl and I am in awe of her."</p>
      <p>The grieving mum has set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/jonathan-massandy">GoFundMe page</a> to help pay for Mr Massandy's funeral costs, which has so far raised more than $7,000.</p>

      <p>In an emotional <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> post Ms Prijit wrote: "My heart aches. I feel so completely and utterly empty right now.</p>
      <p>"Not only were you my true love, you were our children's world, Bobbie's bestfriend and Ajay's super hero.</p>
      <p>"I feel so lost right now and keep wanting to wake up from this nightmare."</p>
