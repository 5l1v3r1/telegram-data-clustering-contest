      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:16:41+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:16</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Bobby Duncan has opened up on his decision to leave Liverpool for Fiorentina, insisting his decision to make the Serie A switch wasn't for money.</p>
      <p>Duncan, who is Steven Gerrard's cousin, joined Fiorentina in a controversial Â£1.8million transfer from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old forward had been prolific for Liverpool's youth sides last season, and helped the Reds win the FA Youth Cup for the first time in 12 years.</p>
      <p>But with Sadio Mane, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino forming what <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bobby-duncan">Duncan</a> described as "the best front three in the world" and Rhian Brewster knocking on the door behind them, the teenager knew his chances of first-team football at Liverpool were limited.</p>
      <p>"It was a difficult decision to be honest," Duncan told <a href="https://www.violanation.com/2019/11/15/20959054/fiorentina-player-spotlight-a-conversation-with-primavera-star-bobby-duncan">ViolaNation.com</a> . "I was in a difficult moment at that time.</p>

      <p>"Something was missing. It wasn't over money. It wasn't over anything else other than I want to play first team football soon.</p>
      <p>"Liverpool has Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane, Rhian Brewster. That front three is the best front three in the world. It was hard to knock them down.</p>
      <p>"In my mind, I thought I would go and play abroad. Serie A is just below the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to make a name for myself, show the Liverpool and Fiorentina fans who I am."</p>

      <p>Duncan added: "I always loved Liverpool, but my love now is to the Fiorentina fans. I need to repay them for showing me the love since I arrived.</p>
      <p>"Leaving Liverpool was a difficult decision. I was only there for a year, but I didn't see the path forward for me there."</p>
      <p>Duncan featured in Jurgen Klopp's first team for their pre-season friendlies in the summer, but an almighty row broke out shortly before the closure of the summer transfer window when Duncan's agent Saif Rubie accused the Reds <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-accused-bullying-bobby-duncan-19022281">of "mental bullying" in blocking potential moves away</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> denied the accusations, and a stand-off was avoided as Duncan was allowed to move to Fiorentina.</p>
      <p>Duncan is yet to play for Fiorentina's first team, but has scored four goals in 10 appearances for their under-19s.</p>
