      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> real estate heiress was acquitted Friday of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">murdering the father</a> of her children, ending more than two years of house arrest after her family posted one of the highest bail amounts on record.</p>
      <p>After 12 days of deliberation, jurors found <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/prosecutors-heiress-changed-his-life-then-plotted-his-death">Tiffany Li</a> not guilty of killing Keith Green in 2016 over a custody dispute. The case gained widespread attention when Li's family -- which built a fortune in real estate -- posted her unprecedented <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-murder-suspect-posts-unprecedented-35m-bail-after-friends-family-help-out">$35 million bail</a>.</p>
      <p>Li's attorney, Geoffrey Carr, told reporters his client plans to travel to China to see her family and strengthen her relationship with her children.</p>

      <p>“Any time any defendant is found not guilty in a serious crime, they’re (given) a gift by somebody — I don’t believe in God, but somebody — and they should pay attention,” he said.</p>
      <p>Carr said Li's defense team of three lawyers and four investigators would have worked just as hard had they been appointed by a judge to a poor defendant, adding that her fortune played no role in her acquittal.</p>
      <p>San Mateo District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said his office was disappointed with the verdict.</p>
      <p>"As we always say, this is how the jury system works, and we respect the jury for what it does," he said.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Li lured Green to her San Francisco-area mansion where her boyfriend, Kaveh Bayat, shot him in the mouth. They contend the couple hired two people to dispose of the body.</p>
      <p>Green's body was found along a dirt road just north of San Francisco nearly two weeks later. Blood evidence was found in Li's Mercedes-Benz and gunshot residue was discovered in her garage, prosecutors said.</p>

      <p>Li's attorneys deny she had anything to do with the slaying. They argued Green was killed in a botched kidnapping attempt. They said she had already settled the custody dispute with Green.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors suffered a setback this month when a witness, Oliver Adella, was arrested on suspicion of contacting an ex-girlfriend and witness for the defense. Adella was prepared to testify that Li and Bayat asked him to dispose of Green's body.</p>
      <p>He was never called to the stand. Bayat was acquitted of gun charges, but jurors were deadlocked on the murder charges, prompting a judge to declare a mistrial in his case.</p>
      <p>Charges are pending for Adella.</p>
