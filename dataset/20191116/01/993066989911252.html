      <p>:: Volunteer holiday to Faroe Islands</p>
      <p>THE Faroe Islands are closing for maintenance on April 16 to 17 2020 and are calling for willing 'voluntourists' to sign up. Just 100 participants will be enlisted to give their time for free to help maintain and preserve the breathtaking Faroese landscapes, in return for free accommodation, food and transport on the islands.</p>
      <p>They will just need to pay for their own travel to the Faroe Islands. At the end of the project volunteers and local people will enjoy a celebratory meal, with Faroese food, local beer and traditional chain dancing. Visitfaroeislands.com/closed.</p>
