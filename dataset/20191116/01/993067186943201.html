      <p>THE parents of a four-week-old baby from Co Antrim have been charged with child cruelty offences.</p>
      <p>Amanda Fulton (31) and her husband Christopher Fulton (30) from Rockfield Gardens, Mosside, are charged over alleged offences on November 7.</p>
      <p>A court heard the baby suffered a fractured skull, brain injuries and broken ribs and is thought to have long-term brain injuries as well as being blind.</p>
      <p>The couple face the same four charges.</p>
      <p>They are accused of grievous bodily harm with intent, two counts of child cruelty involving two different children and causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.</p>
      <p>The couple appeared at Coleraine Magistrates' Court on Monday to face the charges but a press ban prevented proceedings from being reported. The ban was lifted at the court on Friday by a district judge.</p>
      <p>A police officer told the court the baby was taken to a GP on November 7 before being rushed to hospital in an ambulance.</p>
      <p>After stabilising, doctors discovered the babyâ€™s liver was lactated and there were multiple rib fractures.</p>
      <p>A police officer said the fact some of the infant's rib fractures were healing led the medical expert to believe this was "not one isolated incident".</p>
      <p>On further investigation, another of the couple's children, an older child, was found to have an abrasion below her eye and bruising to the back of her head.</p>
      <p>The officer told the court the couple could not explain the injuries to their children.</p>
      <p>The court heard a death threat, believed to be from a loyalist paramilitary group, has been issued against the couple and that tensions are running high in the estate where they are from.</p>
      <p>The details of the case were outlined during unsuccessful bail applications for both accused.</p>
      <p>A defence lawyer queried if ambulance staff had been interviewed to ascertain if any injuries may have caused during transfer of the critically baby to hospital.</p>
      <p>He also highlighted the baby was only recently born and enquired if there was an indication injures was caused during labour.</p>
      <p>But the court was told this has been ruled out by the examining doctor, along with the fact delivery was by caesarean section.</p>
      <p>Bail was refused for both and the couple were remanded in custody to appear again by video-link next month.</p>
