      </p>
      <p><b>How do you stay cool mentally when preparing for international cricket?</b><br/>You can do that only by keeping those things aside that you cannot control. And try to focus on things that you can control.</p>
      <p><b>You look comfortable against fast bowling. How do you prepare for that?</b><br/>It's very important to play one ball at a time, and not think too far ahead.</p>
      <p><b>The fastest bowler you've faced so far?</b><br/>Billy Stanlake in the IPL.</p>
      <p><b>Who's the best non-Indian cricketer you've played with or against so far?</b><br/>AB de Villiers</p>
      <p><b>What is Virat Kohli like in the dressing room, compared to how competitive he is on the field? </b><br/>He is a very fun-loving and light-hearted guy.</p>
      <p><b>How will he react if you offer him the Punjabi food you've grown up eating, like <i>chhole bhature</i>?</b><br/>I'm not even going to try.</p>
      <p><b>What kind of music do you listen to?</b><br/>I like listening to hip-hop and rap. Bands like The Weeknd.</p>
      <p><b>Do you have a favourite sportsperson outside cricket?</b><br/>Yeah, many. I like Neymar Jr a lot.</p>
      <p><b>What will you ask him if you find yourself in an elevator with him?</b><br/>I'll just ask him how he trains.</p>
      <p><b>One thing you don't like about social media.</b><br/>Unwanted attention.</p>
      <p><b>What would you want to get first, Test hundred or an IPL hundred?</b><br/>Obviously Test hundred.</p>
      <p><b>The first match you saw at a cricket ground? </b><br/>It was in 2006, an India v England Test match <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/14681/scorecard/238186/india-vs-england-2nd-test-england-tour-of-india-2005-06">in Mohali</a>.</p>
