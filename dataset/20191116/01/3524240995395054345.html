      <p>Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief James Onoja, has advised the Kogi electorate to shun violence in Saturday’s governorship election in the state.</p>
      <p>Onoja, who is the President of the Igala Heritage Foundation, in a statement, cautioned all political stakeholders in the state to ensure that they avoid violence and electoral malpractices by all legal and reasonable means.</p>
      <p>He said the elections should be free, fair and credible.</p>
      <p>The senior advocate urged the voters not to cast their ballot based on sentiment but on the competence of the candidate.</p>
      <p>The statement read in part, “The governorship election in Kogi State is very crucial and we want the good people of the state to remove their eyes from the peripherals to the big picture.</p>
      <p>“We want to challenge voters in Kogi State, especially the youth, not to succumb to the divisive politics by desperate politicians in the state. Whichever is your tribe, please vote for good governance and accountability.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room has charged the policemen deployed for today’s governorship election in Bayelsa State to protect the voters, especially women.</p>
      <p>The group’s alternate chair, Esther Uzoma, who made the call during a press briefing in Yenagoa on Friday, said it was imperative for policemen on election duty to be guided by the rules of engagement.</p>
      <p>She urged the police to ensure that all perpetrators of electoral violence were arrested and duly prosecuted in order to serve as a deterrent to others.</p>
      <p>Uzoma also advised the security agencies to demonstrate their commitment to non-partisan support to electoral security throughout the exercise.</p>
