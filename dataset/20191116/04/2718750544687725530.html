      <h1>Bill Murray Starts Living in <i>The Now</i>, Alongside Dave Franco on Quibi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:29:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:29</time> by <a rel="author">Halle Kiefer</a></address>
      <p>This is going to seriously cut into his busy engagement-photo bombing, frat-party crashing, and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/bill-murray-steals-french-fry-marthas-vineyard-photos">French fry–stealing</a> schedule, but according to <i>Variety</i>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/bill-murray/">Bill Murray</a> has <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/bill-murray-peter-farrelly-quibi-comedy-series-1203406456/">reportedly joined</a> Quibi’s <i>The Now</i> for a reoccurring role alongside series stars Dave Franco, O’Shea Jackson Jr., and Daryl Hannah.</p>
      <p>Co-created by Oscar-winning <i>Green Book </i>director <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/peter-farrelly/">Peter Farrelly</a>, and co-directed with brother Bobby, <i>The Now </i>features a spectacularly bleak premise that takes a hard left into ostensibly uplifting territory. Per <i>Variety</i>, protagonist Ed Poole, played by Franco, “is about to take his own life when he finds out from his mother that his brother just died by suicide and his dad also did in the past. Ed quickly realizes the only thing that will make his life worth living is to ‘forget the past, screw the future, and just live in the now.’” Dang. With a set-up like that, Bill Murray is gonna have to deliver all the hijinks that set can stand. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/quibi/">Quibi </a>is currently scheduled to launch in April 2020.</p>
