      <p>LONDON:Â Rafael Nadal recovered to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-5 on Friday (Nov 15) but faces an anxious wait to find out whether he will play Roger Federer in the last four at the ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>The Spanish top seed is pinning his hopes on Daniil Medvedev beating defending champion Alexander Zverev in the evening match in Group Andre Agassi in London.</p>

      <p>Nadal's efforts will count for nothing unless Medvedev, who now has nothing to play for, beats Zverev. A win for the German would send Nadal home.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if I will see you tomorrow because it depends on the match of this evening but I did all the things that I could today," said Nadal.</p>
      <p>"I fought until the end two days ago and today, so if I am able to play in front of you tomorrow against Roger it will be a huge honour. If not, I really hope to see you next year."</p>
      <p>Nadal, who has already secured the year-end number one ranking, has never won the end-of-season tournament and had a miserable start at the O2 Arena, being outplayed by Germany's Zverev.</p>
      <p>But the 19-time Grand Slam champion produced an astonishing comeback to defeat Medvedev, the Russian fourth seed, on Wednesday and give himself a chance of qualifying from the round-robin phase.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas, 21, had already qualified for the semi-finals before Friday's match after beating Medvedev and Zverev.</p>

      <p>Serve dominated in the first set on Friday, with neither Nadal nor Tsitsipas facing a break point as the match drifted inexorably towards a tie-break.</p>
      <p>The Greek sixth seed came out on top, hammering an ace on his first match point to seal the set.</p>
      <p>The second set followed a similar pattern until the fifth game, when a Tsitsipas double-fault handed Nadal two break points - the first of the match.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard could not capitalise but he upped the pressure in Tsitsipas's next service game and earned another break point, which the Greek again survived.</p>
      <p>But Nadal earned a fourth break point in Tsitsipas's next service game and this time the Greek player slapped a regulation forehand wide and Nadal went on to level the match.</p>
      <p>A pumped-up Nadal maintained his momentum in the early stages of the deciding set, putting consistent pressure on his opponent's serve but he failed to convert a clutch of break points.</p>
      <p>Nadal earned two more break points in the 11th game and this time made it count as Tsitsipas put a backhand wide and he served out to win the match.</p>
      <p>After the match Nadal received the trophy for finishing the year as the top-ranked player.</p>
      <p>"I'm super happy," he said. "Honestly, after all the things I went through in my career in terms of injuries I never thought at the age of 33-and-a-half I would have this trophy in my hands again.</p>
      <p>"It's something really, really emotional for me. A lot of work in the shadows to be where we are today."</p>
      <p>Six-time champion Federer, who was in Group Bjorn Borg, secured a spot in the semi-finals for the 16th time in his career on Thursday by beating Novak Djokovic in straight sets.</p>
      <p>Austrian fifth seed Dominic Thiem also qualified for Saturday's semi-finals.</p>
