      <p>Gavrikov scored on a tap-in off the stick of a Blues player 9:34 in. With 43 seconds left in the first period, McEachern squeezed in a wraparound between Korpisalo’s pad and the post to tie it.</p>
      <p>Six seconds into a power play in the second period, Schenn got his team-leading 11th goal with a wide-open shot over Korpisalo’s glove.</p>
      <p>The Blues have played 10 overtimes, tying them for second-most in NHL history through 20 games of a season.</p>
