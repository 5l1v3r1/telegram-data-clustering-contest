      <h1>DC Heroes Unite in Crisis on Infinite Earths’ First Official Pictures</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:19:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:19</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>In just a few weeks, The CW’s most ambitious Arrowverse crossover to date will unite the heroes. But it may already be too late to save the multiverse.</p>
      <p>The CW has released the first official photos from <b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b> episode 1, which will take place in <b>Supergirl</b>. In these pics, several of Supergirl’s friends are drawn to Earth 38 as the Crisis finally arrives. Additionally, there’s a first look at Jonathan Kent, the newborn son of Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane.</p>
      <p>This will be the last time that Oliver Queen takes part in a crossover, since <b>Arrow</b> will end in early 2020. However, it looks like Oliver’s daughter, Mia, will be sticking around through this storyline. There may be some additional surprises in store, as the crossover approaches.</p>

      <p><b>Supergirl</b> will kick off <b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b> on Sunday, December 8. The second part will unfold in <b>Batwoman</b> on Monday, December 9. Meanwhile, <b>The Flash</b> will feature the third part on Tuesday, December 10. Then on Tuesday, January 14, 2020, <b>Arrow</b> and <b>DC’s Legends of Tomorrow</b> will wrap up the crossover.</p>
