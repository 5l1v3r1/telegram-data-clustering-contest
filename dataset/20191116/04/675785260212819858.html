      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-jackson">Michael Jackson's</a> children Prince Michael and Paris Jackson have shown how close they are as brother and sister.</p>
      <p>Prince Michael, 22, has spoken in glowing terms about his sister Paris, 21, as they glammed up for the 60th birthday celebrations of Motown records.</p>
      <p>The King of Pop's offspring gave a rare insight into their lives as they let the cameras follow them as they got ready.</p>
      <p>Prince Michael and Paris spoke candidly about their sibling relationship and it became clear that there was plenty of love and a little rivalry between the pair.</p>
      <p>Posting a pic of them on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , Prince Michael wrote: "I don’t always dress up…but when I do it’s with my gorgeous sister @parisjackson. Stay classy my friends."</p>

      <p>Model Paris soon responded to the Loyola Marymount University graduate and she was equally as sentimental with her reply.</p>
      <p>Paris wrote: “i love this so much!! you are so handsome and did such an amazing job on stage, i get more proud of you each day. i love that we get to do these things together and so excited for what’s to come!! love you.”</p>
      <p>As the pair got ready for the Motown event, they used a throwback to their father to help them with Rushka Bergman. He was the personal stylist for Michael Jackson and was also the creative consultant and costume designer for his This Is It concerts in London.</p>
      <p>Paris was pleased with the pampering as she dressed in a bridal inspired gown.</p>
      <p>She declared: “I feel like a princess. I never actually went to prom. I, uh, skipped it to go see Metallica so this feels nice. I would want my prom dress to look like this.”</p>

      <p>Prince was also in reminiscing mode as he looked back at his childhood.</p>
      <p>He spoke warmly about seeing Rushka with his father: “Growing up I got to see Rushka style my dad and put on jackets like this, you know? So it kind of comes full circle for me to be donning the robe, so to say.”</p>
      <p>Hollywood Life has reported that since graduation, Prince has been spending his time with his charity Heal, in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>A source told the media outlet the charity is aimed “at raising money to help fight child hunger and homelessness in L.A. It’s something he’s extremely passionate about, he feels like it’s what he should be doing with his life.”</p>
