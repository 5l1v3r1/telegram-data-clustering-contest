      <p>HONG KONG — Rebellious students and anti-government protesters have abandoned their occupation of at least one major Hong Kong university after a near weeklong siege by police, but some other schools remain under the control of demonstrators.</p>
      <p>Major traffic disruption plagued the city on Saturday even as schools and universities remain closed around Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Police retook control of suburban Chinese University after students and protesters left. Police and protesters fought running battles at the campus Tuesday, which had been transformed into a fortress by hundreds of protesters.</p>
      <p>The presidents of nine universities issued a joint statement late Friday calling on the government to resolve the political deadlock and restore safety and public order.</p>
      <p>Protests are now in their sixth month.</p>
