      <p>Charles Oliveira will look to prove yet again tomorrow night (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) at UFC Fight Night 164 live on <a href="http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?sharedid=MMAMania&amp;subId1=xid:fr1573748915673hgd%7Cxid:fr1573854517263acc">ESPN+</a> from inside Ibirapuera Gymnasium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, that he’s one of the most underrated fighters in MMA today.</p>
      <p>Oliveira, 30, will be testing his luck against lightweight gamer Jared Gordon as the two lock horns on UFC Sao Paulo’s main card. It will be Oliveira’s second fight in Brazil this year after “do Bronx” choked out David Teymur at UFC Fortaleza this past February.</p>
      <p>While the Brazilian has lost some very important fights in the past, Oliveira has now won his last five Octagon appearances all by way of finish. In the process, Oliveira has extended his record for most UFC submission wins to an outstanding 13. All in all, “do Bronx” has proven to be one of the most dominant fighters at 155 pounds over the past two years.</p>
      <p>In advance to his clash with Gordon, UFC has released some of the greatest performances in the UFC career of Oliveira. From his recent TKO victory over rival Nik Lentz to his incredible submission win over veteran Jim Miller last December, Oliveira’s highlight reel is jam-packed with memorable action.</p>
      <p>Check it out in the above video player courtesy of UFC.</p>
      <p>While these finishes are nice to look at, Oliveira still has to get the job done this weekend at UFC Sao Paulo. Because even though the Brazilian has won his last five, Gordon is a hungry contender on the rise with little fear inside of the cage.</p>
