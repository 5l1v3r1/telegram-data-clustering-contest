        <b>FANS FLOCK TO TAKE PART IN CONSULTATION</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fans have wasted no time in taking the opportunity to give their thoughts on <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s latest plans for the City Ground as part of the £100m project.</p>
      <p>More than 1,000 people have already offered feedback to the club since new images were revealed on Friday morning, whetting the appetite of what the stadium will look like once it’s finished.</p>
      <p>The club hope to start work on <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-amazing-new-3540790">redeveloping the Peter Taylor Stand</a> in the New Year, and say around 5,000 seats could in place for the start of next season, therefore minimising disruption to existing ticket holders.</p>

        <b>PREMIER LEAGUE SIDES KEEN ON MATTY CASH</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a>'s Matty Cash is a £12m target for Everton, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-player-ratings-season-3532587">been in good form</a> for the Reds so far this season, helping them challenge towards the top of the Championship under new head coach Sabri Lamouchi.</p>
      <p>And his performances at the City Ground are said to have attracted the attention of Everton, with the Toffees claimed to be "lining up" a £12m move for Cash in January, when the transfer window opens for business.</p>

        <b>REDS HAVE GREAT CHANCE OF PROMOTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>Promotion to the Premier League is there for the taking this season, according to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> captain Ben Watson.</p>
      <p>After 15 games, the Reds are nicely positioned in the Championship under new head coach Sabri Lamouchi having enjoyed an excellent start to the new campaign amid a wide open division.</p>
      <p>Forest are fifth having racked up 28 points and have a game in hand on those sides above them in the league, following the recent postponement of their home date with Reading.</p>

        <b>CITY GROUND REDEVELOPMENT WILL DO WONDERS FOR AREA</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nottingham Forest’s City Ground redevelopment project could provide a bumper boost to the local economy, as well as creating a considerable number of jobs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-amazing-new-3540790">Fresh images of the proposed transformation</a> of the Reds’ home have been revealed as the plans go to public consultation.</p>
      <p>With a planning application expected to be submitted before the end of the year, work would then be due to get underway in 2020 should permission be granted.</p>
