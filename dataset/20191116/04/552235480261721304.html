      <p>Both men remain in custody.</p>
      <p>Forensic teams have sealed off the area where her body was discovered and her home as investigations continue.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Chris Friday of Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team said: "Our thoughts at this time are with Nicola's family and friends and we are determined to seek justice for them.</p>
      <p>"Nicola died following a significant blow to the head.</p>
      <p>"Her body had been placed in the wheelie bin and dumped in the undergrowth and we want to establish when that happened and when she was last seen alive.</p>
      <p>"We know that the bin was probably there on November 1 and we are now trying to establish when Nicola was last seen alive.</p>
      <p>"We would still welcome any more information around any aspect of the investigation, but I am really interested to hear from anyone who saw her after around the first week of October."</p>
