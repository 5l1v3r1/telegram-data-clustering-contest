      <p>None of the firms linked to a deadly outbreak of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/legionnaires-death-hotel-bosses-told-19005199">Legionnaires disease</a> in Edinburgh in 2012 are to face legal action, it has emerged.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scot-dies-legionnaires-disease-after-18969752">outbreak</a> claimed the lives of four people and left 92 others seriously ill – with many still suffering the effects.</p>
      <p>The source of the outbreak has never been conclusively proven and remains a mystery, despite a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/second-brit-dies-legionnaires-disease-18982343">seven-year probe</a>.</p>

      <p>Legionnaires’ disease is a lung infection caused by the Legionella bacteria and spreads through the breathing in of droplets of contaminated water.</p>
      <p>The heartbroken partner of Bert Air, who died following the outbreak, has been notified that proceedings against two firms – Ashland Industries UK Limited and MacFarlan Smith Limited – scheduled to start this month have been dropped by the Crown.</p>
      <p>Proceedings against three other firms, North British Distillery Company Limited, Pera Services Limited and Chemtech Consultancy Limited, ended last year when not guilty pleas were accepted.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Outraged Catherine McDonald, 61, who was with Bert for 12 years, said: “People keep saying it’s about the money – it’s not the money.</p>
      <p>“I want an apology. I want somebody to put their hand up and say, ‘Sorry, it was us. We apologise for what’s happened.’</p>
      <p>“To my knowledge, there’s a young lad out there in his 30s who’s still suffering from the actual after-effects of Legionnaires.</p>
      <p>“Give the money to him, he needs it, not us.</p>
      <p>“I’ve lost my partner, I can’t bring him back but he needs a life.” Bert, 56, came home ill from a building site in Gorgie, Edinburgh, with a suspected chest infection.</p>
      <p>But he was rushed to hospital by his frantic partner as news of the outbreak emerged.</p>
      <p>Just 12 hours later, Bert died surrounded by family after suffering a massive heart attack as his body tried to battle the disease.</p>

      <p>Catherine, who still keeps her late partner’s ashes on the mantelpiece at home, said: “I think if things had been reversed and it’d been me, he’d still be fighting and wanting answers. I don’t want this brushed under the carpet.</p>
      <p>“Is there a big secret somewhere they don’t want us to know? I can’t be the only one.</p>
      <p>“The other people affected and other people who died, don’t tell me they don’t want answers because I don’t believe it.” The other victims of the outbreak to lose their lives were John Lonnie, Sean Ferguson and Sylvia Riddell.</p>
      <p>The Crown Office said: “It is the duty of the Crown to keep cases under review and after full and careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, including the available admissible evidence, Crown Counsel decided that there should be no further proceedings.”</p>
