      <h3>From Damisi Ojo, Akure</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, on Friday, assured that the state of economy of the country would soon improve as the National Assembly is working with the executive to move the country forward.</p>
      <p>Lawan spoke on Friday, in Akure, the Ondo State capital, while paying a visit to the state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, and the senator representing Ondo South, Nicholas Tofowomo, who was involved in a fatal road accident, few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He said, “All of us work together to give legislation to support of the federal government in order to perform and strengthen the country. We want to see the country improving in economy because this can’t be done without the support of the senate.”</p>
      <p>Lawan assured that the senate is available to assist the state governor saying, “Anytime you need the support of the senate for anything, call on us, we will be available.”</p>
      <p>“We also need the state government to participate in anything we do at the senate,” the senator added.</p>
      <p>Responding, the Ondo State governor, Akeredolu, expressed appreciation on the senator’s visit and added that his government is ready to work with President Muhammadu Buhari to move the country forward.</p>
