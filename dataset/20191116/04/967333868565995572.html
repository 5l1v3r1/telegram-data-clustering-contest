      <p>Dwayne ‘the Rock Johnson’ has lit up social media after he announced the release date of DC’s Black Adam Movie, where he plays the leading role and shared concept art. In his post on Instagram, the 47-year-old actor wrote about how he fell in love with superheroes as a child and fantasized of becoming a Superman, however later in life understood that he was too rebellious and rambunctious to become the caped hero. The Rock added that he was honored to join the DC universe and to be cast as Black Adam, a “rebellious one of a kind superhero, who’ll always do what’s right for the people - but he does it his way.”</p>

      <p>​Some users, though, were not happy with DC’s decision, saying Johnson, the highest paid actor of this year, is not fit to portray the antihero due to his bad acting skills</p>

      <p>​Other users begged the star to persuade Warner Brothers (WB) to release the director’s cut of another DC movie, Justice League. Zack Snyder, who directed most of the film, left the project after his daughter died. The version that was shown in theatres was a huge detour from Snyder’s vision. Users also called on the Rock to make WB cast Henry Cavill again as Superman.</p>

      <p>​Other users wondered why did the studio decided to release the film on the same week as James Cameron’s Avatar 2. The first Avatar became the highest grossing movie in 2009 and was moved to second place only ten years later by Marvel’s Avengers.</p>
