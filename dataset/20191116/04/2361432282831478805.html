      <h1>Colbert Reveals Putin Won Donald Trump's Rap Contest (Video)</h1>
      <h2>Colbert ends the week with… you know what, the rhymes were actually pretty dope</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:56:31+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/ross/" target="_blank">Ross A. Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Stephen Colbert ended the week by poking fun at a Donald Trump-themed rap contest, with a gag in which the winner turned out to be exactly who you’d expect. The twist: The winner’s rhymes were actually uh, kinda dope.</p>
      <p>For those who missed it, the #MAGAChallenge is a social media rap competition that encourages Trump supporters to spit some verse in support of the Orange one. It kicked off in September but simmered mainly under the radar until a week ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1192854195625316352">when Trump announced on Twitter</a> that he will invite the winner of the challenge to the White House.</p>
      <p>Now, it’s not clear how the winner would even be chosen — plus Trump has a history of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-campaign-scam-contests-meal-with-president-909188/">just straight up lying about this kind of thing</a>. But on Friday’s episode of “The Late Show,” Colbert rolled a funny short video claiming that Trump had selected his winner, and shocker, it was Vladimir Putin.</p>

      <p>But then the clip continued with Vlad’s winning raps and as it turns out, he — or more accurately whoever on Colbert’s writing staff came up with them — kicked some ill rhymes.</p>
      <p>If you can’t watch video yet, here are the lyrics:</p>
      <p>Privet<br/>About to win the rap tournament<br/>Or MAGA challenge, whatever is the word for it<br/>Listen to the rhymes<br/>You can see I’m out here earning it<br/>Killing the beat, and pretending it’s a journalist<br/>I’m like if 2 Chainz<br/>Annexed the Ukraine<br/>I’ve got more bars then cocktail on Blu-Ray<br/>Quid pro quo problems?<br/>Call Russia to-day<br/>You trust me more than your own CIA<br/>Invite me to the White House<br/>Which I want badly<br/>I got ideas for next election make you much happy<br/>Until then I’ll be out here<br/>Having fun rapping<br/>The new Puff Daddy, call me Buff Vladdy<br/>We’ll amass riches<br/>Doing bad business<br/>No one ever finds out, I keep facts hidden<br/>Slick Raps<br/>Even though I lack pigment<br/>Show some love Donald, the way your dad didn’t</p>
      <p>Watch the whole clip below. (Also, “privet” is Russian for “hello,” in case you were wondering.)</p>
