      <p>PASADENA, Calif. (KABC) -- It's called "Stop the Bleed."<br/><br/>The training helps provide emergency medical treatment - involving putting pressure on a wound - to prevent excessive bleeding in the event of a trauma from a bullet, knife or other cause.<br/><br/>The <a href="https://www.stopthebleed.org/">American College of Surgeons program</a> began after the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 when 20 children and six adults were killed. The ACS says a review of autopsy records indicated that many of the victims in that shooting died from severe bleeding.<br/><br/>Huntington Hospital in Pasadena is one of the Southern California organizations that offer the training.<br/><br/>The program helps "to teach lay people or just bystanders how to recognize life-threatening bleeding and the skills to stop the bleed," says Michelle Baker-Lee, manager of the Huntington Hospital Trauma Program.<br/><br/>Trauma nurses at Huntington Hospital have trained staff from the Pasadena school district. Even before Thursday's shooting at Saugus High more and more schools were asking for this training.<br/><br/>"They want to know, 'Hey how can I save someone's life? Potentially stopping that bleed will get them to the hospital and we can save their lives here," says Baker-Lee.<br/><br/>It's not just for teachers and staff. Parents are taking this training as well.<br/><br/>Jamie Brady-Smith is a parent who says "As a mother to teenage kids I had to take this training and it was important with all of these shootings that not only I took it but that my kids took it too."<br/><br/>The chances of any of us being involved in a shooting are small. You're more likely to be involved in a car accident. The person closest to you may be the only one who can help right away.<br/><br/>"One in 10 of us will be in a motor vehicle collision that has life-threatening wounds with active bleeding. With these skills you can save someone's life or save your own life," says Baker-Lee.</p>
