      <h1>Russia Wants Its Tu-22M3 Bombers To Control The Black Sea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Mark Episkopos</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>Russia's bomber reclassification is raising questions among arms control experts.</p>
      <p>The official reclassification of the Tu-22’s updated models from tactical bombers to heavy, nuclear-capable strategic bomber could lead to a new round of accusations concerning Russia’s potential non-compliance.</p>
      <p>In what is the latest sighting of Russia’s most prolific strategic bomber, the Russian Defense Ministry reported earlier this week that two Tu-22M3’s conducted a patrol mission over the Black Sea. According to their <u><a href="http://tass.com/defense/1048703">press release</a></u>, "Two Tu-22M3 long-range bombers performed a scheduled flight in the airspace over international waters in the Black Sea.”</p>
      <p>Zvezda, the official television channel of the Russian Defense Ministry, has published a <u><a href="https://tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/201903141902-12s0.htm">brief clip</a></u> of the occasion. The footage begins with several close-up shots of pilots undergoing final preparations from inside the cockpit, before capturing a multi-angle view of the take-off. The latter part of the video depicts the two Tu-22M3’s cruising side by side.</p>
      <p>The Tu-22M3’s covered a distance of approximately 4,500 kilometers over the span of five hours. It would not have needed to refuel while deployed, as it boasts a maximum range of 6,800 kilometers.</p>
      <p>Currently serving as the staple strategic strike bomber of the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS), the Tu-22M3 (NATO reporting name Backfire-C) is a slight iteration of the long-lived Soviet Tu-22M. The Tu-22M3 retains the design philosophy of its predecessor, boasting an upgraded NK-25 engine and minor nose alterations.</p>
      <p>The Backfire-C houses the newer, inertially-guided Kh-32 anti-ship missiles that are designed to also be effective against land-based enemy infrastructure. But the star of the Tu-22M3’s armament suite is the <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-new-kinzhal-aero-ballistic-missile-has-3000-km-range-if-fired-supersonic-bomber">Kh-47 Kinzhal</a></u> (“dagger”), a nuclear-capable ballistic missile with a purported effective range of up to 3,000 kilometers.</p>
