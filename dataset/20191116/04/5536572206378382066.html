      <h1>Maurkice Pouncey Responds To Primanti Bros Offering Him a Job As A Bouncer (TWEETS)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:28:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:28</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Along with Myles Garrett receiving a 6-game suspension plus the playoffs, Maurkice Pouncey also received a 3-game ban after he came in with fists and legs swinging on the Cleveland Browns defensive end after he watched him hit his quarterback with a helmet in the head.</p>
      <p>Pouncey won’t be getting paid for those games, but there is no reason to not get any money during that time period.</p>
      <p>Primanti’s Bros in Pittsburgh took to Twitter and offered a three-week bouncer gig to Pittsburgh Steelers Maurkice Pouncey following the Steelers-Browns brawl. The Pittsburgh-based restaurant said it’s reaching out to Pouncey to see if he’d be interested in working the door at Primanti’s original location in the Strip, starting today.</p>

      <p>“Primanti’s offer to hire Pouncey for three-weeks is completely unrelated to his three-week suspension for protecting, ‘his man,’ Steelers’ Quarterback Mason Rudolph,” Primanti’s wrote in a press release.</p>
      <p>“The job of protecting Rudolph, I mean… the Strip District Primanti Bros. is bigger than any game,” said said Toni Haggerty, the Strip District Primanti’s manager in a press release. “We take it seriously and will only hire the best.”</p>
