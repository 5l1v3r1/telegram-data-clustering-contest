      <p>Annie M. Ford, 51, pleaded <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/atlanta-woman-pleads-guilty-using-nba-player-stolen-try-get-loan/YfcpvRV3KZ6yEdUYDBvSKK/">guilty</a> to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with the 2013 loan application, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey said in a news release.</p>
      <p>From October to November that year, Ford tried to obtain the loan from a New York-based lending company using the stolen identity of a NBA player who lived in New Jersey, the release said. She admitted to creating fraudulent documents under the man’s name.</p>
      <p>In addition, she forged the victim’s signature on multiple documents, including an escrow document that said the $2.5 million loan would be deposited in her bank account, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/atlanta-woman-pleads-guilty-using-nba-player-stolen-try-get-loan/YfcpvRV3KZ6yEdUYDBvSKK/">the release said.</a></p>
      <p>Another falsified signature appointed another person involved in the scheme to serve as the victim’s “attorney-in-fact” for banking and financial matters, the release said. That person’s name was not released.</p>
      <p>A wire fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. An aggravated identity theft charge carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison, which must be served consecutively with any other prison term.</p>
      <p>Ford’s <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/atlanta-woman-pleads-guilty-using-nba-player-stolen-try-get-loan/YfcpvRV3KZ6yEdUYDBvSKK/">sentencing</a> is scheduled for March 4, 2020.</p>
