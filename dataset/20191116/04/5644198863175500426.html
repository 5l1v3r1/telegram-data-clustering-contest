      <p>BELFAST: Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk has warned his teammates Northern Ireland will be tough to break down when the two countries meet in their key Euro 2020 qualifier on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Northern Ireland are a tough side to beat. They are not a side that is easily broken down, certainly not in Belfast” he told a news conference on the eve of the game at Windsor Park.</p>

      <p>“We’ll need to be really good and to show our particular qualities.</p>
      <p>“But we are up for the game and prepared for everything. We expect in the beginning they will come storming out at us,” Van Dijk predicted.</p>
      <p>The Dutch need just a point to qualify for the finals and playing in next year’s tournament is eagerly anticipated by the Liverpool defender.</p>
      <p>“I’ve waited as long time for this opportunity,” he said after the Dutch missed the last European Championship finals in France, plus the World Cup in Russia last year.</p>
      <p>“We would like to make sure of our Euro place as quickly as possible. No one needs to motivate us about that.</p>
      <p>“Qualification is a dream and we then we want to achieve another dream when we get to the finals,” Van Dijk added.</p>
      <p>A final decision on whether both Memphis Depay and Georginio Wijnaldum will play would only be made hours before Saturday’s kick off, coach Ronald Koeman said at the same news conference.</p>
      <p>But he suggested their potential absence would be no problem for the Dutch, even though a home win in Belfast could turn the group outcome on its head.</p>
      <p>“Wijnaldum trained with us for half the session on Thursday and Depay for a bit,” he said.</p>
      <p>Wijnaldum had been battling with ‘flu while Depay has a thigh injury.</p>
      <p>“I’ll make a final decision on the type of injury and whether it’s worth the risk. This is no World Cup or European Championship final.</p>
      <p>“The season is also far from finished,” Koeman added.</p>
      <p>The Dutch lead Germany in the Group C standings with a better head-to-head record as both stand on 15 points from six games.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland could steal a march on the Dutch if they win on Saturday with a 2-0 scoreline but would realistically also need to beat Germany away in Frankfurt on Tuesday to qualify.</p>
