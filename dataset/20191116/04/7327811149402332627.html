      <p>SOUNDVIEW, The Bronx (WABC) -- A vigil was held in the Bronx to remember a 7-year-old boy who died after falling out a window.</p>
      <p>For Kingston 'King' Spencer's mother, Rossey Mancebo, there was also a bit of solace in the most painful moment of her life. When doctors told her that her son didn't make it, she made the most heart-wrenching decision - she chose to give Kingston's organs to those in need, so they can live.</p>
      <p>"My baby came to serve in the grace of the almighty," said Mancebo.</p>
      <p>Mancebo is trying to be strong, but inside she is crumbling.</p>
      <p>"It was the same loving soul every morning - wake me up if I wasn't up, and reassure me that everything was going to be okay," she said.</p>
      <p>Some knew Kingston, others didn't, but they all came together with candles and balloons to remember the 7-year-old with Down syndrome.</p>
      <p>"He's going to be remembered as a sweet, kind understanding little boy," said neighbor Diane Scott.</p>
      <p>It was last Saturday when Kingston, left unattended for a moment in a room in his ninth floor apartment in the Bronx, removed a cardboard window covering and fell out at the Bronx River Houses on Harrod Ave - now informally named 'King's Way.'</p>
      <p>Kingston died on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"My heart is broken into pieces I can't imagine," said family friend Wilde Crispin.</p>
      <p>Mancebo's decision to donate her son's organs helped save five other lives.</p>
      <p>"It's not the right thing to do, it's also the godly thing to do," she said, "I felt other kids and other families would highly benefit from this gift."</p>
      <p>It was a gift left behind by a young soul taken too soon.</p>
