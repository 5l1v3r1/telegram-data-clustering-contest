        <b>Tusker Lite National Basketball League Playoffs</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Women</b>: KCCA <b>71</b> UCU <b>56</b> (KCCA Lead 1-0)</p>
      <p><b>Men</b>: Oilers <b>62</b> Warriors <b>53</b> (Oilers lead 1-0) </p>
      <p>Jimmy Enabu made a surprise appearance and the injury-plagued City Oilers exploited it to defeat the Warriors 62-53 and take a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five National Basketball League (NBL) playoff semis. </p>
      <p>Enabu, only able to be the City Oilers on one-off occasions ever since he joined highly demanding flying school, looked surprisingly sharp on the way 12 points in 20 minutes of play. He was unstoppable for a Warriors defence that failed to put bodies in his path.</p>
      <p>Tony Drileba sunk a game-high 17 points for the reigning six-time champions, who came into the game without injured players Stephen Omony, Francis Azolibe and Jonathan Egau. It left them with only Landry Ndikumana and James Okello in the frontcourt.</p>
      <p>The Warriors could not capitalise in a game that really did not get going until the third quarter.</p>
      <p>“We were out of rhythm today but I’m confident we will be better for Game 2,” said Warriors coach Ronnie Mutebi after the game.</p>
      <p>The Warriors were led by Chris Basheke, with 14 points while Stanley Mugerwa and Gatwech Kutai added 12 and 11 points respectively. Game 2 is on Sunday evening at Lugogo.</p>
      <p>In the ladies semis, Judith Nansobya and Cynthia Irukunda scored 15 points apiece as the KCCA Leopards defeated nemeses UCU Lady Canons 71-56 to take a 1-0 lead in their series. Sarah Ageno, with 20 points and 14 rebounds, was UCU’s star while Zainah Lokwameri scored 15 points.</p>
