      <h1>Prince Andrew: I stayed friends with Jeffrey Epstein because I am ‘too honorable’</h1>

      <p>Prince Andrew stayed friends with convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein because he was “too honorable” to end the relationship, The Duke of York <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50431163">told the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>The royal — who was photographed at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion as recently as 2010 and is accused of having sex with one of his alleged underage victims — said he stayed at the pervert’s lair for the sake of “convenience.”</p>
      <p>The photos of the prince peeking his head out from behind the front door of the Upper East Side townhouse were taken just months after Epstein’s Florida prison sentence on charges of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.</p>
      <p>“It was a convenient place to stay. I mean I’ve gone through this in my mind so many times,” he told the BBC’s Emily Maitlis in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/prince-andrew-claims-he-doesnt-recall-meeting-alleged-teen-sex-slave/">an interview set to air Saturday.</a> “At the end of the day, with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do.”</p>
      <p>The prince blamed his admittedly faulty decision making on his strong sense of loyalty.</p>
      <p>“At the time I felt it was the honorable and right thing to do, and I admit fully that my judgment was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable, but that’s just the way it is,” he said.</p>
      <p>The royal also denied claims he slept with alleged Epstein sex slave <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/21/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-we-had-orgy-with-prince-andrew-when-i-was-18/">Virginia Roberts Guiffre</a>.</p>
