      <h1>Le Vignoble bar with wine on tap opening in Bristol this weekend</h1>
      <h2>Up to 64 wines will be available at Le Vignoble</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:30:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Geoffrey Bennett</a></address>
      <p>A new wine lounge and shop is opening in Bristol.</p>
      <p>At 6pm today (November 16) the doors open at Le Vignoble in Finzel's Reach - which is being marketed as "wine heaven".</p>
      <p>Set in the restored heritage brewery building, Le Vignoble will be offering up to 64 wines in a sophisticated bistro-style environment.</p>
      <p>A changing monthly selection of wines will be available from self-service dispensers which keep the wine at the perfect temperature.</p>
      <p>Le Vignoble is opening on the ground floor of the historic Fermentation Buildings and the interior has been decorated with reclaimed wood tables, vintage lights and aged leather Chesterfield sofas.</p>

      <p>This will be first Le Vignoble in Bristol and the largest of their three sites, the others being in Bath and Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Le Vignoble founder Yannick Loué is on a mission to take the snobbery out of the wine tasting tradition and help everyone to sample new wines and flavours.</p>
      <p>Every wine comes with tasting notes and all staff are highly trained experts able to guide novices towards new grapes, regions and varieties.</p>
      <p>An authentic French tapas-style food has been created to perfectly compliment the wine.</p>
      <p>The menu includes meat and cheese platters, much of it imported direct from Paris, alongside several traditional hot dishes. </p>
      <p>There are also craft beers and ciders all sourced from the South West.</p>
      <p>Mr Loué said: "I really want to democratise the wine tasting process and make it accessible to everyone.</p>
      <p>"So many people stick to well-known wine brands because they don't have an easy way to find out more about the huge variety that's available.</p>
      <h3>'People are encouraged to become more adventurous'</h3>
      <p>"By enabling people to help themselves and sample wines in smaller quantities, people are encouraged to become more adventurous and really find out what they like."</p>
      <p>Gavin Bridge, executive director at Cubex, the developer behind Finzels Reach, said: "Le Vignoble brings something completely new to the city's eating and drinking scene and I, for one, can't wait to try it out."</p>
      <p>Another <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/wine-bar-south-bristol-kask-3533463">bar with wine taps opened</a> in south Bristol last month.</p>
