      <p>Former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile took delight in Roger Stone being found guilty.</p>
      <p>“He’s going to be sentenced on Feb. 6. I hope he roasts in hell,” Brazile told HBO host Bill Maher Friday night. “That son of a bitch!”</p>
      <p>The former Trump associate <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dirty-trickster-roger-stone-found-guilty-of-lying-to-congress-in-wikileaks-case">was found guilty</a> earlier in the day for impeding a House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The Republican operative faces up to 50 years in prison for lying to Congress, obstructing an investigation, and intimidating a witness, a jury determined.</p>
      <p>The jury found that Stone, 67, repeatedly lied about his attempt during the 2016 presidential campaign to collaborate with WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange to obtain stolen emails and dirt on then-candidate Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>Russian intelligence is accused of hacking into the network of the Democratic National Committee and other party officials and organizations and passing the stolen information on to WikiLeaks, which released the hacked content during the 2016 campaign.</p>
      <p>Brazile said Stone “worked with WikiLeaks to destroy not just Democrats, but to destroy our democracy, so I hope he roasts in hell, and I wish I’m at the sentencing hearing because I’m going to wear the best looking red dress I could and say, 'Go to hell. Not jail.'”</p>
      <p>“Go to f---ing jail!” Brazile said. “Go to jail, go to hell. I’ve never been so proud of the jurors. Hell yeah, thank God I wasn’t on that damn jury. You just worked me up, shit, how do you wake me up like this? I can’t stand that son of a bitch.”</p>
