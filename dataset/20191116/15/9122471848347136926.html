      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Makes Bold Claim About This Year’s Clemson Team</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:33:56+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Clemson has been criticized countless times this season because of its schedule. Although several analysts think Dabo Swinney’s team has been underwhelming this year, ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit actually believes they might be better than last year’s squad.</p>
      <p>The Tigers went undefeated through the regular season and College Football Playoff. Trevor Lawrence caught fire toward the end of the year and the defense played outstanding in the trenches.</p>
      <p>Swinney has the Tigers undefeated through the two months of the season, but they only rank third in the College Football Playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>Herbstreit was part of ESPN’s broadcast crew for last weekend’s showdown between Clemson and NC State. He thinks the team is on the verge of pulling off another postseason run.</p>
      <h3>During this morning’s edition of College GameDay, Herbstreit said this Clemson team could actually be better than last year’s team.</h3>
      <p>From <a href="https://247sports.com/college/clemson/Article/Kirk-Herbstreit-Dabo-Swinney-Clemson-Tigers-College-Football-Playoff-Wake-Forest-Demon-Deacons-138656718/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Maybe because I got to call the NC State game last week — you know it was 28-0 in the first quarter, right? You know you still have to call the game the rest of the way. Maybe I’m just seeing things, but I think this Clemson team could be better than the team that they were last year,” Herbstreit said, referencing Clemson’s 55-10 road rout of NC State last Saturday.<br/><br/>“I think the close call against North Carolina surprised people. Trevor Lawrence has thrown a few picks. It made everybody step back. They are better offensively than they were a year ago with Trevor Lawrence. He’s processing things quicker. They’re better with Travis Etienne and Lyn-J Dixon. This is a team that can play on the outside with their receivers. I know they had a close call against North Carolina — we’re not going to know how good they are until the Playoff.”</blockquote>
      <p>This is a bold take from Herbstreit, who has stated all season that Clemson will remain a contender. His trust in the program has clearly paid off.</p>
      <p>With only two games remaining on the schedule, the Tigers are so close to going undefeated in the regular season once again.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for today’s Clemson-Wake Forest game is at 3:30 p.m. ET from Memorial Stadium.</p>
