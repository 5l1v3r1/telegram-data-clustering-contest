      <h1>Fawad Chaudhry submits privilege motion against Khawaja Asif in NA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:44:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Federal Minister for Science and technology Fawad Chaudhry has on Saturday submitted a privilege motion against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Khawaja Asif for misrepresentation of the truth on the floor of the House.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader maintained that the conduct of Khawaja Asif is tantamount to a breach of the privilege of the entire House.</p>
      <p>Fawad Chaudhry stated that Khawaja Asif – on November 14, 2019 – quoted the representatives of the federal and Punjab governments as saying “let Nawaz Sharif die,” which is a vivid misrepresentation of the truth and the decision of Islamabad High Court (IHC) regarding the interim bail of former premier Nawaz Sharif on medical grounds.</p>
      <p>“The Para 2 of the detailed judgment of the Islamabad High Court which states that ‘the representatives of the Chief Minister Punjab and the Prime Minister had expressed no objection if interim bail to Nawaz Sharif was granted,’ outrightly negates the statement of Khawaja Muhammad Asif which he made on the floor of the House, and it is a clear breach of the privilege of the entire House.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, it should be taken up for discussion and may be sent to the Standing Committee on Rules of Procedures for further action.” </p>
