      <p>The daughter of a woman who has been missing from a mental health unit for over two weeks is begging for help in finding her.</p>
      <p>Georgina Fletcher, 50, known as Gina, was last seen on October 31 before escaping from Lakeside Mental Health Unit in Isleworth, west London.</p>
      <p>Her daughter Leah and sister Siobhian have been worried sick since she vanished and are desperate for updates.</p>
      <p>Police are getting increasingly concerned over Georgina’s welfare and are trying to track her down.</p>
      <p>Leah told Metro.co.uk: ‘She’s gone missing before but she would always let us know where she was or the police would be able to track her phone.</p>
      <p>‘She was admitted six weeks ago when the police could see she was unwell and they took her to the mental health unit.’</p>

      <p>Leah added: ‘They have searched every inch of nearby Crane Park over the last seven days and they are planning to expand their search.</p>
      <p>‘I just really want to find my mum. I’d like anyone with information to get in touch. The missing persons post on my Facebook account I have done has been shared over 10,000 times and quite a few people have come and volunteered to look for her.’</p>
      <p>In a message to her mother, Leah added: ‘The police want you to know you are not in any trouble whatsoever. You know what we are talking about.’</p>
      <p>The Lakeside Mental Health Unit is run by the West London NHS Trust who said they were unable to comment.</p>
      <p>Metro.co.uk has contacted the Metropolitan Police.</p>
