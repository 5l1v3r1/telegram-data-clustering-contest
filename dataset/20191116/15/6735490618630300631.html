      <p>Don Johnson only has wonderful things to say about his daughter Dakota Johnson.</p>
      <p>“Of course I’m her father, but I can also recognize talent when I see it,” the “Miami Vice” actor said about his daughter who he shares with ex-wife Melanie Griffith.</p>
      <p>While talking to <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/stellar/don-johnson-my-daughter-is-the-most-gifted-actress-alive/news-story/475d2f602229d716638921949ad61fae"><i>The Sunday Telegraph’s Stellar</i></a> magazine, Don, 69, said that the “50 Shades of Grey” star is “one of the most gifted actresses alive today.”</p>

      <p>Johnson and Griffith have been married twice, first briefly in 1976 and then again from 1989-96. But the two are still close all because of their daughter.</p>

      <p>“It’s pretty simple: when you love your children and want to share your life with them, it’s foolish to denigrate or have any animosity with their mother,” he said. “Children model you more than they listen to you.”</p>
      <p>Johnson has also been teasing the revival of “Nash Bridges”.</p>
      <p>“We’re writing it now, and it’s a two-hour television film, and they’re looking at it as kind of a way to launch it again as a series,” Johnson tells the ladies of “The Talk” on an upcoming episode. “Good Lord, I don’t know how I feel about that.”</p>

      <p>“The Cheech [Joe Dominguez] will be back,” he added. “I think in this adaptation of ‘Nash Bridges,’ he’s going to actually be selling weed. And the cops in San Francisco are actually going to be smoking it.”</p>
