      <p>These are the 31 magnetic balls that were inside a 12-year-old boy’s bladder after he got them stuck up his penis.</p>
      <p>The child said he forced them up there while ‘exploring his anatomy’ and was rushed to hospital two months later after experiencing severe abdominal pains.</p>
      <p>Buckyballs are popular toys sold in the form of metal spheres, which can be stacked into any shape.</p>
      <p>Urologist Doctor Wang Jun said the pieces were ‘very difficult to retrieve’ due to their magnetic properties.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘They tend to slip when trying to grasp them, or they form a large ball-shaped cluster.’</p>

      <p>At first it was not immediately clear to medics what was causing the young patient’s abdominal pains.</p>

      <p>Dr Wang said: ‘It didn’t appear to us to be a gastrointestinal problem, so we pulled him aside and asked him.</p>
      <p>‘He admitted that, about 70 days earlier, he inserted Buckyballs into his urethra.’</p>
      <p>In the end doctors had to fill the boy’s bladder with air to make it easier to locate and grab the Buckyballs, avoiding the need for more invasive surgery.</p>
      <p>The boy, from Wuhan, capital of China’s Hubei Province, is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
