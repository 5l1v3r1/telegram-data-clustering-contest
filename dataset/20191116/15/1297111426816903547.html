      <p>The Fajardos are a football family.</p>
      <p>To what extent? Well, when brothers Cody and Cory Fajardo discussed their marriage plans, the respective dates had to be set so they didn’t conflict with football season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-cody-fajardos-presence-with-the-saskatchewan-roughriders-is-something-to-savour">Cody Fajardo — the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ franchise quarterback — married his wife Laura in March.</a> Cory, Cody’s older brother, is to tie the knot with his fiancé Sochi in December.</p>
      <p>“The reason why I have to get married in December is because of the anticipation of the season going as far as it is going,” said Cory Fajardo, 29, who 16 months older than Cody.</p>
      <p>“He said it was best that I pick December for him to be there. For him, it was easy in March because he’s a football guy. He was off, so all of his football friends were able to show up.”</p>

      <p>Cody has shown up this season for the Roughriders, who are to play the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers in Sunday’s West Division final with a berth in the 107<sup>th</sup> Grey Cup game on the line.</p>
      <p>The unheralded free-agent signing went from being a backup with the Toronto Argonauts (2016-2017) and B.C. Lions (2018) to a first-year starter with the Roughriders.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/roughriders-trade-zach-collaros-to-argonauts">Cody was pressed into duty just three plays into the 2019 regular season after Zach Collaros suffered a concussion due to an illegal hit to the head.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“This kid has just been waiting for his shot and he has always been waiting for it with every team he has been on,” Tim Fajardo, the father of Cory and Cody, said from his home in Brea, Calif.</p>
      <p>“I don’t wish for any quarterback to go down, but we didn’t know that was going to happen to Zach so quickly. Cody got his shot and he got his chance to prove what he could do.”</p>
      <p>There has been uncertainty regarding Cody’s participation in Sunday’s final due to an oblique injury that he suffered during a practice on Oct. 30. Cody will play Sunday, but the Riders haven’t decided if he will start.</p>
      <p>Head coach Craig Dickenson said Friday that all three quarterbacks — Fajardo, Isaac Harker and Bryan Bennett — will see action and the starter will be determined by the offensive staff.</p>
      <p>Tim never doubted that Cody would be on the field for the playoff game.</p>
      <p>“Now his trainer or his doctor may have said something different, but I know my son,” Tim said. “He’s a tough son of a gun and he’s going to be out there playing.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo is coming off a regular season in which he led the CFL in passing yards (4,302) while completing 18 touchdown passes against eight interceptions. He also rushed for 10 touchdowns en route to being named the West’s most outstanding football.</p>
      <p>Excellence on the gridiron is hardly novel for Fajardo, who demonstrated an aptitude for football at a young age.</p>
      <p>In his first game of flag football, for example, seven-year-old Cody returned a fumble 30 yards for a touchdown.</p>
      <p>“They found out then that he could run and that he could play,” Tim said. “He was already self-aware of what was going on the field.”</p>
      <p>Cody’s development as a quarterback could be credited to his father and Cory, both of whom brought a defensive mindset to the family. Tim was a defensive end and Cory was an outside linebacker.</p>
      <p>“We were always roughhousing and so, as an outside linebacker, instinctively you don’t like quarterbacks,” Cory said. “When we were roughhousing, it was kind of the linebacker-quarterback mentality. He instinctively ran from me and I instinctively chased after him when we were growing up.”</p>
      <p>Cory kept running into high school, where he was a star with the Servite High School Friars. He guided the Friars to a California state title in 2009 and was named the winner of the Glenn Davis Award, presented annually to the best high school player in southern California.</p>
      <p>“To this day, I still have football coaches and fans say they’ve never seen another quarterback in southern California play the way my brother did,” said Cory, who teaches theology at Servite.</p>
      <p>“You’ve seen it yourself. When he was in high school, he was the exact same way and he could come back from any deficit. He was never rattled and there were plenty of times where we should not have won games or even advanced in the playoffs.”</p>
      <p>Cody has also stood out under pressure for the Riders. The 27-year-old quarterback has led the Riders to four last-minute victories this season.</p>
      <p>“He’s a great player, but he’s very even-keeled on the field,” Tim said. “He doesn’t get excited and he thrives under pressure.”</p>

      <p>That ability and success in high school and later with the University of Nevada Wolf Pack contributed to a unique nickname for Fajardo.</p>
      <p>“At the time, my friends would come over to the house and they would call him ‘The Champ,’ ” Tim said.</p>
      <p>Cody added a Grey Cup championship in 2017 when the Toronto Argonauts defeated the Calgary Stampeders 27-24. (In the 2017 East final, Fajardo — the Argos’ short-yardage quarterback — had scored the game-winning touchdown on a one-yard run against Saskatchewan.)</p>
      <p>“(The Grey Cup) was my first introduction to Saskatchewan fans,” Tim said with a chuckle.</p>
      <p>Tim would later meet more Riders fans while watching the Labour Day Classic, in which Cody led the Riders to a 19-17 win that was capped by Brett Lauther’s walk-off 26-yard field goal.</p>
      <p>Tim enjoyed his visit to the Queen City and was pleased that Cody recently signed a two-year contract extension carrying through the 2021 season.</p>

      <p>“I believe that he’s at the right place at the right time and he’s where he’s supposed to be,” said Tim, who was to arrive in Regina on Friday for the West Division final before heading to Calgary for the Grey Cup game.</p>
      <p>“He’s had great stats this year and you know they’re only going to get better next year.”</p>
