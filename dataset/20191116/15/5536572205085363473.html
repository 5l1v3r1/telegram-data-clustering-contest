      <h1>Draymond Green Kneed Celtics’ Daniel Theis Right In The Groin (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>It seems like it’s been awhile since Draymond Green last caught heat for hitting another player between the legs, so he made sure to get the conversation going once again during his latest incident.</p>
      <p>During the 105-100 loss to the Boston Celtics on Friday night, the Golden State Warriors forward was trying to stop Celtics’ Daniel Theis drive to the basket with some stellar defense.</p>
      <p>Theis likely regretted that play as his junk ended up being hit by Draymond’s knee as he stayed down on the court in pain.</p>
