      <h2>They say thousand of doctors are in the PSC list waiting for appointment</h2>

      <p>The Kerala Medical Post Graduates Association (KMPGA) has come out strongly against a government move to hike the retirement age of doctors in the medical education service in the State from 62 to 65 years.</p>
      <p>This was the fourth time in the last 10 years that the retirement age of medical college doctors were being hiked, citing government’s financial constraints and “shortage” of doctors, KMPGA pointed out.</p>
      <p>It said that in a State where about 1,000 doctors with postgraduate qualification were passing out annually and where nearly 5,000 job seekers in various PSC rank lists waiting for appointment, it was quite hypocritical of the government to quote shortage of doctors as the reason for hiking pension age.</p>
      <p>KMPGA representative V. Rohit said the argument that the State would lose the service of experienced clinicians through retirement was wrong and that majority of those holding top positions in medical colleges were on the administrative side and not involved in patient care.</p>
      <p>“The government has been redeploying staff and shifting faculty and staff on working arrangement to run new medical colleges in the State, instead creating new posts. There are at least 400 vacancies at entry cadre and upwards in many base specialities which have not been reported to the PSC,” Dr. Rohit pointed out.</p>
      <p>The KMPGA said that in 2017, when junior doctors went on strike against retirement age hike, the Health Minister had made several promises. Creating more posts, making PG as the entry cadre qualification, speeding up of PSC appointments, reporting of all vacancies have all remained as empty promises.</p>
      <p>To propose another pension age hike on top of this would be a double blow for young medicos.</p>
      <p>The KMPGA said that it would organise State-wide agitations if the government went ahead with the move to hike retirement age again.</p>
