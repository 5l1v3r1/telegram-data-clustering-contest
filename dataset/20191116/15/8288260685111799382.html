      <h1>'It's a joke' - outrage at 'ridiculous' sentence handed to Amos Price over sickening Pelsall dog attack</h1>
      <h2>Amos Price was responsible for the sickening attack in Woodlands Crescent in Pelsall last mont, which sparked national outcry</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:07:35+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:07</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly Ashmore, https://www.facebook.com/dudleybclive/</a></address>
      <p>A cruel yob who let a dog loose to savage a cat to death has been jailed for 18 weeks - but many animal lovers feel he should have got longer.</p>
      <p>Amos Price was responsible for the sickening attack in Woodlands Crescent in Pelsall last month, which sparked national outcry.</p>
      <p>The maximum sentence the 30-year-old could have received for causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal was six months, however <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/amos-price-jailed-encouraging-dog-17256018">he was given credit for his prompt guilty plea</a> .</p>
      <p>Despite this, many felt the crime should have carried a longer jail term - and many <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/">Black Country Live</a> readers took to Facebook to vent their frustrations.</p>

      <p>One said: "Ridiculous sentence. This was their chance to set an example that this kind of s**t is not acceptable. 18 weeks is so, so poor."</p>
      <p>Another added: "That's not justice, it's a joke. Animals have feeling too, that poor cat must have been so scared. No animal deserves to die like that."</p>
      <p>A third said: "Eighteen weeks will be nothing for a scum bag like that. It’s time to toughen up the laws on animal abuse and make it a minimum of two years jail for acts like this."</p>
      <p>"Not long enough," wrote another. "He should be put away and the key thrown away.....sick/evil man."</p>
      <p>During a hearing at Walsall Magistrates' Court on Thursday, November 14, Price revealed he was "ashamed and sorry” for what he had done. He had said he was intoxicated at the time and would not have done it if he was sober.</p>

      <p>The horrifying attack was caught on CCTV and the footage - <b>which can be viewed above</b> - showed Price provoking his lurcher-type dog to attack the cat, which was perched on a wall.</p>
      <p>Price can be seen grabbing the dog by the collar and lifting it up to ensure it is aware of the cat, called Cleo.</p>
      <p>Cleo was then dragged from the wall and onto the ground, where the dog sunk its jaws into her, shaking her from side to side before disappearing from shot.</p>
      <p>Price, of Trevor Road, Pelsall, ran from the scene and went to ground after West Midlands Police <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/police-still-hunting-amos-price-17232836">launched a wanted appeal to find him</a> and bring him to justice.</p>
      <p>Information received from the public helped track Price down and he was arrested on Tuesday (November 12).</p>
      <p>The court heard Price had told arresting officers: “I was going to hand myself in on Friday anyway, I’m done with looking over my shoulder and my family are getting threats.”</p>
      <p>Speaking after the hearing, Chief Supt Andy Parsons said: "As a police force and community we have all been appalled by the sickening actions of Price. It was completely mindless, senseless and beyond any justification.</p>

      <p>"We are grateful for the support we received from the public who played a vital role in assisting our investigations and making sure he was brought to court to face punishment."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the RSPCA said Price had refused to say where the dog was and had suggested he had given it to a friend. However, as he was also banned from keeping animals for life, he will be unable to reclaim the animal when he is released.</p>
