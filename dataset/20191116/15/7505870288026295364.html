      <h1>How to add USB ports to your power outlets without touching a single wire</h1>

      <p>If you’re like me, you often find yourself thinking how great it would be if the power outlets in your home also have built-in USB ports. You also find yourself thinking just as often that there’s no way you’re messing with electricity or paying an electrician hundreds of dollars to install them. Then, I found the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BX83E0U?tag=b0c55-20">SnapPower Electrical Outlet Cover Plate with USB Charger</a> and everything changed. It’s brilliant — all you have to do is unscrew your current wall plate and pop this one on in its place. It draws power just from a couple of integrated metal contacts so you don’t even have to touch a single wire!</p>
