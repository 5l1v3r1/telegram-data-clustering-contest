      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>The meeting of the delegation of the three parties -- NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena with the Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has been postponed till further notice.</p>
      <p>It was scheduled to take place at 4:30 PM on November 16.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Recently, the Congress and the NCP, which fought the assembly polls together along with the Shiv Sena had prepared a draft common minimum programme (CMP).</p>
      <p>The three parties have been making efforts to form a non-BJP government in the state where the President's Rule was imposed earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena and the BJP, who had fought the polls together, could not form the government due to differences over power-sharing.</p>
      <p>However, the leaders had asserted the meeting was to be based on talks regarding agrarian crisis in Maharashtra and not to stake claim.</p>
      <p>Pawar had said a Sena-NCP-Congress government will be formed and will complete a five-year term as he ruled out the possibility of mid-term polls in the state currently under President's Rule.</p>
      <p>The BJP emerged as the single-largest party in the state with 105 seats in 288-member assembly followed by Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44.</p>
