        <b>Ulster squeezed out a vital 17-16 victory at Bath in their opening match in Pool Three of the European Champions Cup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tries in each half by John Cooney and Rob Lyttle helped the PRO14 side make it five straight wins against Bath in European competition. Scrum-half Cooney converted both and kicked a 70th-minute penalty to seal the win.</p>
      <p>The Premiership side kept in touch with two penalties from Freddie Burns before replacement wing Gabriel Hamer-Webb scored their only try, converted by Burns. Rhys Priestland's 66th-minute penalty put them ahead for the first time in the match but Cooney had the final say.</p>

      <p>England World Cup trio Sam Underhill, Jonathan Joseph and Ruaridh McConnochie were making their first Bath appearances since returning from Japan.</p>
      <p>They opened confidently and Priestland soon had a chance to open the scoring but pulled his 45-metre penalty just wide.</p>
      <p>Instead, it was the visitors who struck first after 13 minutes. Will Chudley had only just charged down an attempted box-kick by his opposite number Cooney when his own kick through was blocked. Cooney was quickest to the loose ball, hacked on for a kind bounce and sprinted in from 40 metres.</p>

      <p>Two penalties in quick succession from Burns, briefly taking over the place-kicking as Priestland nursed a knock to his leg, cut the lead to a single point on the half-hour.</p>
      <p>Bath's midfield passing lacked the precision of Ulster's, for whom full-back Will Addison was a particularly creative influence.</p>
      <p>The former Sale man, capped by twice by Ireland, was involved in a prolonged series of attacks at the end of the half which finally yielded a penalty in front of the Bath posts but Cooney somehow pushed his kick wide.</p>
      <p>On their return from the half-time break, Ulster showed signs of wilting - missing tackles on Semesa Rokoduguni and Will Stuart and having a narrow escape when Charlie Ewels' offload deep into the visitors' 22 found Stuart McCloskey rather than Bath hands.</p>
      <p>But it then took a try-saving tackle by Priestland to deny centre Luke Marshall at the other end before Ulster increased their lead on the hour with a try by right wing Lyttle, chasing Addison's kick down the touchline.</p>

      <p>Cooney converted to make it 14-6 but Bath hit back straight away as rookie left wing Hamer-Webb rounded Addison with ease to score in the corner, with Burns adding the conversion.</p>
      <p>A high tackle by Alan O'Connor on Underhill allowed Priestland to give Bath the lead, but the advantage was short-lived as Cooney kicked a simple penalty in reply.</p>
