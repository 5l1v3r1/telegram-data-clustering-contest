      <h2>The day off isn’t taken out of Home Bargains staff’s holiday allowance meaning 22,000 employees will still get paid while they spend time with their family</h2>

      <p>Home Bargains will be shut on Boxing Day to give hard-working staff an extra day with their family.</p>
      <p>The discount chain was also shut on December 26 last year so staff “are able to enjoy the Christmas break”.</p>
      <p>The day off isn’t taken out of staff’s holiday allowance meaning 22,000 employees will still get paid while they spend time with their family.</p>
      <p>Full-time employees at <a href="http://thesun.co.uk/topic/home-bargains">Home Bargains</a>  currently get the national legal minimum of 28 days holiday, which includes the eight UK bank holidays.</p>
      <p>The extra day off means workers at the chain will be able to get 29 days of paid leave this year, provided they take their full holiday entitlement.</p>

      <p>Home Bargains stores will remain open on Christmas Eve and will close for Christmas Day and Boxing Day, reopening on December 27.</p>
      <p>Boxing Day is one of the biggest shopping days of the year.</p>
      <p>In the South West there are Home Bargains store in Kingsteignton, Hayle, Bodmin, Barnstable, Exmouth and Par, with plans to build one in Plymouth and Camborne.</p>
      <p>In a post on  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>  and  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a>  , Home Bargains wrote: “To all our staff: Thank you for all your hard work once again this year.</p>
      <p>"All our stores will be closed on Boxing Day to ensure you are able to spend time with your friends and family.”</p>
      <p>The post also thanked customers for their “understanding and support”.</p>

      <p>Another said: “Love this, well done for giving your staff the opportunity to spend quality time with loved ones.”</p>
