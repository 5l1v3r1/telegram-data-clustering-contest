      <h1>Ministry empowers 280 farmers to engage in honey production </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:51:26+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author">Dennis Peprah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Bechem, (A/R), Nov. 16, GNA – The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources (MLNR) has trained 280 farmers in the Bono, Bono East and Ahafo regions in bee keeping and presented to them start-up packs and materials to engage in commercial honey production.</p>
      <p>The beneficiary farmers, selected from forest fringe communities - Kwatire, Adantia, Dawadawa, Bechem, Bomaa, Yamfo, Brosankro and other settlements went through a three-week training programme on modern ways of bee keeping and honey production.</p>
      <p>They received bee hives, bee suits, pairs of jackets, hand gloves, hive tools, bee brushes, stainless bee smokers, protective tools, Propolis collector, bee stand, wax and torch lights.</p>
      <p>Already, the Ministry through its Ghana Forest Investment Programme (GFIP) organised training and supplied 90 farmers in the Atebubu enclave with similar start-up materials.</p>
      <p>The GFIP, being funded by the Climate Investment Fund and the African Development Bank (AfDB) is an intervention that provided option for livelihood enterprise for farmers in forest fringe communities as a means to protect the forest.</p>
      <p>It is a targeted programme aimed at reducing deforestation and environmental degradation in transitional and high forest zones of the country.</p>
      <p>The major strategy under the programme is to reduce pressure and dependency on the natural forests, thereby maintaining their integrity and enhancing their environmental functions, Mr. Benito Owusu-Bio, the Deputy Minister of Lands and Natural Resources explained.</p>
      <p>Addressing the beneficiaries at separate presentation ceremonies held in Sunyani and Bechem, Mr. Owusu-Bio commended the farmers for availing themselves throughout the trainings, and hoped that they would utilise the knowledge acquired to enhance their socio-economic livelihoods.</p>
      <p>He said the programme targeted to train 270 beneficiaries in soap making and 212 in bee keeping in the Western Region, adding that the Ministry in collaboration with the AfDB were set to facilitate and organise all beneficiaries into business cooperatives to sustain them in business.</p>
      <p>“It is believed that with collective bargaining power, you can influence the market to your advantage, while enjoying economies of scale”.</p>
      <p>“Further forming business cooperatives will give you the identity and visibility needed to link you to all government agencies that can offer for your enterprise even after the lifespan of this particular project”, Mr Owusu-Bio stated.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Evelyn Ama Kumi Richardson, the Bono Regional Minister, advised the farmers to justify the opportunities granted by seeing honey production as viable economic activity that could transform their lives.</p>
      <p>She sensitised them on the upcoming District Level Elections and the Referendum, and urged them to come out in their numbers to participate and vote “Yes” in the referendum.</p>
