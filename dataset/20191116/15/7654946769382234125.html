      <h1>Author Nathan Pyle reveals earthlings through the eyes of an alien</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:46:21+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">Mackenzie Dawson</a></address>
      <p>Nathan Pyle has become an internet sensation with his “<a href="https://www.nathanwpyle.art/strangeplanet">Strange Planet</a>” cartoons, which feature drawings of alien-like beings in familiar situations. In one cartoon, a being stands by the stove. “I am heating the sustenance,” it says. And then, in the next frame, as smoke billows from the stove: “I have overheated the sustenance.” It is everyday life, as seen by charming, curious creatures, and it has struck a chord with people across the world. The Strange Planet account boasts 4.6 million Instagram followers. Pyle’s new book of cartoons, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Planet-Nathan-W-Pyle/dp/0062970704/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Strange+Planet&amp;qid=1573853567&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=nypost-20">Strange Planet</a>,” is already an Amazon bestseller even prior to its Nov. 19 publication date.</p>

      <p>In his cartoons, everyday objects are given new names: Confetti becomes “tiny trash”; a refrigerator is a “sustenance preserver.” Teeth are “mouth stones,” and boxing is “recreational face striking.” April Fools’ Day is “Deception Day.” Cats are, well, strange, as cats are. (“Each day we are in close proximity to a highly efficient predator!” says one being, as its cat naps in the background.)</p>
      <p>“When I’m renaming objects or traditions, I try to use a scientific approach of what sounds funniest,” Pyle tells The Post. “Over time, I’ve developed an important rhythm — for instance, a bicycle is a ‘two-wheeled foot pusher.’ You don’t want it to be super verbose.”</p>
      <p>And why these beings?</p>
      <p>“Part of what I’m interested in doing is creating a planet where the traditions are very familiar but they’re emotionally more advanced than we are. They’re able to talk about their emotions,” says Pyle. “[The cartoons are] not about why we do things, but why it’s significant to us. Like blowing out birthday candles — why do we do that? It’s about ways that we care about each other.”</p>
      <p>Roughly 40 percent of his audience comes from outside the US; Pyle has received e-mails from people saying their English has improved through reading his cartoons. Others have seen the traditions depicted in his cartoons (see: Deception Day) and shared customs from their own countries. “In France, it’s le poisson d’avril, or April Fish,” notes Pyle. “It shows the complexity of humans. We’re interested in the truth, but we’re also interested in the idea of what happens if we suspend the truth for one day.”</p>
      <p>The main takeaway of his drawings is that curiosity is beneficial.</p>
      <p>“These beings are so open to new expressions, food, etc.,” he says. “And I think that’s the best theme. Curiosity goes hand in hand with empathy. You will understand strangers and your friends better if you’re curious.”</p>
