      <h1>Ulster pay heavy price for win over Bath</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:37:29+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Ulster squeezed out a vital 17-16 victory at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> in their opening match in Pool Three of the European Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>Tries in each half by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/john-cooney/">John Cooney</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/rob-lyttle/">Rob Lyttle</a> helped the PRO14 side make it five straight wins against Bath in European competition. Scrum-half Cooney converted both and kicked a 70th-minute penalty to seal the win.</p>

      <p>However, the win came with a price. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/ulster-rugby-face-anxious-wait-after-both-star-summer-signings-injured/">Both prop </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/jack-mcgrath/">Jack McGrath</a> and secondrow <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/brumbies/players/sam-carter/">Sam Carter</a> had to leave the field with significant looking arm injuries early in the first half.</p>
      <p>The Premiership side kept in touch with two penalties from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/freddie-burns/">Freddie Burns</a> before replacement wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/wellington/players/gabriel-hamer-webb/">Gabriel Hamer-Webb</a> scored their only try, converted by Burns. Rhys Priestland’s 66th-minute penalty put them ahead for the first time in the match but Cooney had the final say.</p>
      <p>England World Cup trio <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/sam-underhill/">Sam Underhill</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/jonathan-joseph/">Jonathan Joseph</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/ruaridh-mcconnochie/">Ruaridh McConnochie</a> were making their first Bath appearances since returning from Japan.</p>

      </p>
      <p>They opened confidently and Priestland soon had a chance to open the scoring but pulled his 45-metre penalty just wide.</p>
      <p>Instead, it was the visitors who struck first after 13 minutes. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/will-chudley/">Will Chudley</a> had only just charged down an attempted box-kick by his opposite number Cooney when his own kick through was blocked. Cooney was quickest to the loose ball, hacked on for a kind bounce and sprinted in from 40 metres.</p>
      <p>Two penalties in quick succession from Burns, briefly taking over the place-kicking as Priestland nursed a knock to his leg, cut the lead to a single point on the half-hour.</p>

      <p>Bath’s midfield passing lacked the precision of Ulster’s, for whom fullback <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/will-addison/">Will Addison</a> was a particularly creative influence.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale">Sale</a> man, capped by twice by Ireland, was involved in a prolonged series of attacks at the end of the half which finally yielded a penalty in front of the Bath posts but Cooney somehow pushed his kick wide.</p>
      <p>On their return from the half-time break, Ulster showed signs of wilting – missing tackles on <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/semesa-rokoduguni/">Semesa Rokoduguni</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/will-stuart/">Will Stuart</a> and having a narrow escape when Charlie Ewels’ offload deep into the visitors’ 22 found <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/stuart-mccloskey/">Stuart McCloskey</a> rather than Bath hands.</p>
      <p>But it then took a try-saving tackle by Priestland to deny centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/luke-marshall/">Luke Marshall</a> at the other end before <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster">Ulster</a> increased their lead on the hour with a try by right wing Lyttle, chasing Addison’s kick down the touchline.</p>
      <p>Cooney converted to make it 14-6 but Bath hit back straight away as rookie left wing Hamer-Webb rounded Addison with ease to score in the corner, with Burns adding the conversion.</p>
      <p>A high tackle by Alan O’Connor on Underhill allowed Priestland to give Bath the lead, but the advantage was short-lived as Cooney kicked a simple penalty in reply.</p>
