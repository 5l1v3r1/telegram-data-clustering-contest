      <h2>Donna-Rae Crooks' goal with Brain Snacks Co is to give moms “more choice and flexibility with integrating their work and their families.”</h2>

      <p>When Nicole Gaddie entered the café with her toddler daughter, little Alanna was immediately whisked away to make a craft while Gaddie grabbed a seat.</p>
      <p>They’re regulars at Brain Snacks Co in east Regina, where coffee shop meets daycare meets co-working space.</p>
      <p>“I actually get to relax and she gets to make crafts or do whatever activities,” Gaddie said, in praise of the place. “It’s a great environment and just amazing, somewhere that you can actually bring your kid to.”</p>
      <p>Gaddie has experienced dirty looks after bringing her “not even loud or chatty” baby to other coffee shops.</p>
      <p>Brain Snacks Co is the brainchild of another mother, Donna-Rae Crooks.</p>
      <p>She was on maternity leave from her government job when she opened this place in June.</p>
      <p>“Braden’s been here as much as me,” said Crooks of her third child, who happily snacked on protein balls throughout the interview.</p>

      <p>When she had her first child, Crooks felt the options for moms were “too binary. You either had to be on maternity leave or you had to go to work. So I found myself wishing there were more choices.”</p>
      <p>Her goal was to give parents “more choice and flexibility with integrating their work and their families.”</p>
      <p>With help from her vice-president of marketing and operations, Ali Nicholls, Brain Snacks Co was born.</p>
      <p>At Brain Snacks Co, parents can leave their child in the play area, supervised by an early childhood educator. (The regular drop-in charge for kids is $15 for the first hour, then $10 an hour thereafter, or $75 for the day.)</p>
      <p>In the meantime, parents can work on site in the café or hotelling office (which also includes a private room), or leave the place entirely while their children are occupied.</p>

      <p>While Crooks looked to examples like fitness centre daycares and children’s recreation centres, she wanted Brain Snacks’ focus to be on the parent, and “really focus on supporting the moms in their lives.”</p>
      <p>To that end, she offers career coaching and aims to host professional development workshops.</p>
      <p>“We really want to close the gender gap, because I’d like to see women being paid the same as their male counterparts,” said Crooks.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to see women receive the same opportunities in terms of scope of authority, accountability, the levels of risk in the work and projects they receive, the opportunities they get throughout their career, particularly in the years when they may be starting and raising a family.”</p>
      <p>The first session is called Guide to the Mommy Galaxy, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/guide-to-the-mommy-galaxy-by-brain-snacks-co-tickets-76795259689?fbclid=IwAR1IrMYH3JTFVci7Uvj0MwoUKm-ufnmrhLA80FPfT23aBg4ccvY9ItlMx-k">scheduled for Jan. 19.</a> Crooks plans to talk about how having a baby changed her role at work and earnings, her emotional and physical wellbeing, and her relationships.</p>
      <p>“We basically cover all the change that happens in your life when you have a baby, except for how to take care of the baby,” said Crooks.</p>
      <p>“The year back to work (is) one of the hardest, because you have so many different expectations that you’re juggling at that point. You think you’ve just become a mom, but actually every role you play, every hat you wear changes,” she added.</p>

      <p>As Crooks’ partner, one of Nicholls’ main roles has been to create and oversee the menu, which includes vegan and gluten-free options and a children’s menu.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people think when you go vegan, that you’re on a crazy diet … (that) you have to get rid of all like the good food that you’re used to, but it’s really just like substituting other food and making the same dish,” said Nicholls.</p>
      <p>Options include her herb vinaigrette potato salad, a vegan banh mi sandwich, and chocolate-chunk banana bread with espresso cashew butter. “That one came to me in a dream,” she said.</p>
      <p>The menu also has chicken sandwiches and non-vegan options.</p>
