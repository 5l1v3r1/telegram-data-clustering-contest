      <p>I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! starts this weekend with a star-studded line-up set to enter the jungle.</p>
      <p>Stars such as Caitlyn Jenner and Ian Wright will compete for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">the crown</a> over the next three weeks.</p>
      <p>But what are the stars of the show paid in return for three weeks of humiliation, near-starvation and taking part in gruesome Bushtucker trials?</p>
      <p>You might be surprised by just how little - or how much - some of the celebrities earn from their stint in the jungle.</p>
      <p>A TV insider has confessed to The Sun that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> bosses have splurged over £1.4 million on the 2019 line-up, with Caitlyn Jenner reportedly banking the most with a whopping £500,000 fee.</p>

      <p>The world's most famous transgender woman, Caitlyn Jenner, is rumoured to be the highest paid contestant ever.</p>
      <p>ITV bosses have reportedly forked out nearly £500,000 on the global sensation, with hopes she will 'tell all' about her famous former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/the-kardashians">Kardashian</a> lifestyle and messy split with ex-wife Kris Jenner.</p>
      <p>Topping the show's rich list with a half-a-million pay packet, Caitlyn, 70, is set to be TV gold as she opens up about life inside Hollywood's most famous family.</p>
      <p>Following close behind is footballing legend Ian Wright , 56, who is rumoured to be taking home £400,000 for his trip Down Under.</p>
      <p>Former Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle  has reportedly bagged a quarter of a million to sign up for I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The pop star, 34, is estimated to earn £250,000 from her Jungle stint, with producers hoping the star speaks out about the shocking split of Britain's favourite girl band.</p>

      <p>The publication also claimed that Corrie’s Andy Whyment has negotiated a pricey fee of £100,000 for his Australian venture.</p>
      <p>Both TV stars Kate Garraway and Jacqueline Jossa have reportedly agreed on £75K for their fees, while rugby star James Haskell and DJ Adele Roberts fall slightly behind with their rumoured £50,000 cheques.</p>
      <p>The Sun claims that the lowest paid celebs of the series are two of the youngest - Myles Stephenson and Roman Kemp.</p>
      <p>The Capital FM DJ, 26, may have a famous family, but is thought to be earning £40,000 for his jungle adventure.</p>
      <p>At the bottom of the pay cheques is Rak-Su singer Myles.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a>  winner, 28, is estimated to earn £25,000 for his appearance on the ITV show.</p>
      <p>
        <b>I'm A Celebrity starts on ITV this Sunday at 9pm.</b>
