      <p>Black Eyed Peas singer Will.i.am has caused a stir on Twitter after he said that he was subjected to racism during a flight from the Australian city of Brisbane to the capital Sydney. The artist, and a coach on the Voice UK, tweeted that he and his group had experienced their worst-ever service due to an overly aggressive flight attendant, who took out all her frustrations on people of colour.</p>

      <p>​Will.i.am, whose real name is William Adams, said the woman called the police on him because he allegedly did not hear a “P.A. due to wearing noise cancelling headphones”. He then tweeted that he did not ignore a safety briefing and did comply with all instructions.</p>

      <p>​The singer received backlash for revealing the flight attendant’s name, with people sayting the woman may become the target of abuse.

      <p>​Commenting on his decision to reveal the woman’s name, Will.i.am said people are “supposed to call out wrong doings” and that he is using Twitter the same way other people use it to complain about mistreatment. Qantas said it completely rejects the singer's claims that he was subjected to racism.</p>
