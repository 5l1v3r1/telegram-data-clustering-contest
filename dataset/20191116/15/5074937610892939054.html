      <h1>Low public education on district elections worrisome - Awulae Attibrukusu</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:32:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author">Justina Paaga, Bright Ofori Asiamah/Joseph Wiyorbie, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Takoradi Nov 15, GNA - The Paramount Chief of Axim traditional area, Awulae Attibrukusu III, has said the low public education on the district election and referendum was worrisome and should be addressed to enhance Democracy in the country.</p>
      <p>He said the Electoral Commission has barely a month to conduct the elections, but the citizenry, particularly those at the grassroot were not adequately educated on the event.</p>
      <p>Awulae Attibrukusu III, therefore tasked the NCCE and the relevant stakeholders to intensify public education on the elections, especially on the referendum so as to enable them to make informed decisions.</p>
      <p>The Omanhene of Axim said this at the launch of the Regional and Catholic Diocesan sensitisation programme on the Referendum and district elections.</p>
      <p>The programme, organised by the Sekondi-Takoradi Catholic Diocese Justice and Peace Commission wing of the National Catholic Secretariat with support from Konrad Adenaer Foundation is one of the initiatives of the Catholic Church in Ghana to educate and empower people to engage and participate in political discourse and decision making process at both the national and local levels.</p>
      <p>On the theme" Participation of political parties and citizens in the district level elections" was attended by priests, parishioners from all the parishes in the diocese, traditional authorities, Representatives of political parties, MMDCEs and a cross section of the public.</p>
      <p>Awulae Attibrukusu III said it was imperative for a strong public education on the merits and demerits of the Referendum to ensure active participation and massive turn out for the elections.</p>
      <p>"We need to educate and sensitise the public on what shall take place on December 17, and help them to understand the local governance system through Civic education".</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Baffour Djumah a barrister and member of the Diocesan Justice and Peace Commission, took the participants through Articles 243 and 55(3) and called for public education on the upcoming elections.</p>
      <p>He explained the pros and cons of either voting Yes or No in the Referendum and urged the citizenry to vote wisely, adding "your vote is your power".</p>
      <p>Reverend Father Clement kwasi, Director, Governance, Justice and Peace Directorate at the Catholic National Secretariat, called on Christians to participate in political issues by bringing to bear their expertise.</p>
      <p>He said as Christians, they had a major role to play in the political dispensation in the country and not only to concentrate on prayers and preaching.</p>
      <p>Rev Fr. Adjei said it was time for people to shift from being manipulated by politicians to participation and understanding what pertained in the political areana.</p>
      <p>He said the success of the upcoming elections and referendum depended on the massive participation of the masses.</p>
      <p>Mr Anthony Sam, the Metropolitan Chief Executive of STMA, Commended the Sekondi-Takoradi Catholic Diocese for organising the programme describing it as a "mind opening programme" which would go a long to educate the public on the upcoming elections.</p>
      <p>The MCE also stressed the need for intensified public education on the election and called on all to participate in the elections by voting the right people to help deepen the Democratic system at the local level.</p>
      <p>Reverend Monsignor Abuah Quansah, Apostlic Delegate of the Sekondi/Takoradi Diocese, said the church's decision to sensitize and educate the public on the upcoming elections, was to help them make rightful decisions on whether to vote Yes or No in the Referendum.</p>
      <p>He said it was important for the citizenry to contribute their talents to the development of their local areas and make use of the right channels to demand Accountability and transparency from those that hold political office for Sustainable development.</p>
      <p>Monsignor Quansah said governance took place at the grassroots, but that most people were not aware of their roles and therefore could not demand for Accountability from the duty bearers.</p>
      <p>Ghana is currently seeking to embark on Democratic reforms with a constitutional amendment to Articles 55(3) to pave way for the involvement of political parties in the elections of assembly members and unit committee members.</p>
      <p>To achieve this amendment, a critical minimum of over 40 per cent turn-out with over 75 per cent endorsement from voters was required to effect an amendment to the constitutional article 55(3).</p>
