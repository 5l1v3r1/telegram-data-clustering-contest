      <h2>The Hammers' clash with Arsenal on December 9 could now be postponed although their match with Tottenham next Saturday will go ahead as planned</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:41:55+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:41</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>A bomb that dates back to World War Two has reportedly been found just yards away from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham's</a> London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Ongoing work on an apartment development nearby had to be halted after the bomb was discovered on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Police officers set up a 150 metre cordon around the site after they were called to the scene just before midday, reports <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10357856/ww2-bomb-olympic-stadium-arsenal/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballfacebook161119&amp;utm_source=Facebook#comments">the Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>The area has been declared safe by experts for the time being, with a specialist mining team set to attend the site on November 25.</p>
      <p>West Ham's match with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> scheduled for December 9 is now under threat of postponement if there is any change in the safety status of the site.</p>

      <p>Due to the timeframe of the visit from specialists, the Hammers clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> next Saturday November 23 is due to go ahead as planned.</p>
      <p>A source told the Sun: "We think it is an unexploded bomb.</p>
      <p>“It’s crazy to think of all the people walking around here during the Olympics and we had no idea it was here.</p>
      <p>"The bomb is in a tricky position, so could take up to two weeks to sort it out, which takes us into the second week of December.</p>

      <p>“Between now and 25 November teams will be putting together a plan of what to do.”</p>
      <p>However despite suggestions that the object is a bomb, a spokesman for the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) who handle Olympic Park, were keen to stress the item is as yet unidentified.</p>
      <p>A spokesman confirmed there was “an unexplained metal object found during site works in the south of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park”.</p>
      <p>But added: “Following further investigations, the police are satisfied that the cordon can be lifted and the site has now been handed back to the construction company.</p>
      <p>“We will continue our efforts to safely establish what the object is but the park and its venues will continue to remain open.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on Saturday, a spokesman said: "Reports that a WW2 bomb has been ‘unearthed’ yards from London Stadium are wrong.</p>
      <p>"The object has not been unearthed and it has not been identified. Police were called as a precaution and after initially putting in a small cordon their experts were satisfied that contractors should continue their work which will safely establish what the object is.</p>
      <p>"The police returned control of the site to the contractor and removed the cordon."</p>
