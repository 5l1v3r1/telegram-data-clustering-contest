      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Taylor-Swift">Taylor Swift</a>'s new original song for the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Cats-Movie"><b>Cats</b></a> movie soundtrack has arrived, and it's a haunting ballad that will appease both the singer's fanbase and fans of the classic musical.</p>
      <p>Swift cowrote the song for <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Cats-Movie-Trailer-46388543">the live-action adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Broadway musical</a> with Webber himself, who collaborated with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-shares-updates-on-feud-with-scooter-braun-46903480">the American Music Awards</a> headliner <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-beautiful-ghosts-song-cats-movie-46806975">on the lyrics for the track</a> that will be performed by <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Who-Does-Francesca-Hayward-Play-Cats-46397737">ballet dancer Francesca Hayward</a>, who plays Victoria in the film. Luckily Swift's version of the song can be heard above, and it's stunning.</p>
      <p>"All that I wanted, was to be wanted," Swift belts out. "And the memories were lost long ago / So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts." Listen to "Beautiful Ghosts" in full above, and then refresh your memory on <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Cats-Movie-Cast-45070243">the star-studded cast of <b>Cats</b></a> (which includes Swift as Bombalurina) before it hits theaters on Dec. 20.</p>
