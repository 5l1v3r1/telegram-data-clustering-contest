      <p>Polyamory is having its moment in the spotlight, with public curiosity about non-monogamy <a href="https://www.insider.com/people-fantasize-about-being-in-polyamorous-open-relationship-2019-10">on the rise</a> and more celebrities speaking openly about their non-traditional approaches to love.</p>
      <p>Not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy">polygamy</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/polyamory">Psychology Today</a> defines polyamory as the “practice of having multiple intimate relationships, whether sexual or just romantic, with the full knowledge and consent of all parties involved.” In simpler terms, polyamory involves sustaining a relationship with more than one person in which everyone is aware of the other partners involved.</p>
      <p>While there are a number of prominent celebrities <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com.au/celebrity/celebrities-open-relationships-18934">rumored</a> to be engaging in non-monogamous relationships, here are six who have spoken about their polyamorous preferences.</p>

      <h3>Actress Bella Thorne has been in a number of publicly non-monogamous relationships.</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/bella-thorne">Bella Thorne</a>, actress, model, and <a href="https://www.insider.com/bella-thorne-won-pornhub-award-directing-her-and-him-2019-10">adult film director</a>, is far from camera shy when it comes to displaying her non-monogamous dating style. Thorne first publicly confirmed she was <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a26072723/bella-thorne-bisexual-coming-out-gay-times-interview/">in simultaneous relationships</a> with rapper Mod Sun, or Dereck Smith, and YouTuber Tana Mongeau in an interview with Gay Times magazine.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anybody will really understand the bonds that I share with Mod or Tana,” Thorne told the publication. “Yeah, we joke around about [polyamory], but we aren’t in the sense that we don’t put a word, a box or label too many things. It is what it is.”</p>
      <p>Thorne ended her relationships with both <a href="https://www.insider.com/bella-thorne-hits-out-at-ex-girlfriend-tana-mongeau-twitter-2019-7">Mongeau</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/bella-thornes-ex-mod-sun-says-they-got-married-and-divorced-2019-6">Mod Sun</a> earlier this year, but hasn’t stopped displaying her open dating preferences on social media. Thorne’s current boyfriend, Italian singer Mascolo, expressed his support of Thorne’s newest romantic interest, Alex Martini, after Thorne <a href="https://people.com/music/bella-thorne-dating-new-girl-boyfriend-ex-tana-mongeau-approve/">posted a picture</a> of her and Martini on Instagram.</p>
      <p>While Thorne has not labeled her simultaneous relationships with Martini and Mascolo as polyamorous, a slew of fans and <a href="https://stars.topix.com/article/22467/s10">publications</a> have expressed support for the actress <a href="https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/polyam-tana-bella/">promoting non-monogamous visibility</a> in mainstream media.</p>

      <p>Tana Mongeau opened up to her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ4qEMuvoqc&amp;amp;feature=emb_title">5 million YouTube subscribers</a> in January 2019 about her relationship with Thorne. Thorne and Mongeau confirmed they were dating in September 2017 while Thorne was <a href="https://people.com/music/bella-thorne-tana-mongeau-relationship-timeline/">in another relationship</a> with Mod Sun.</p>
      <p>“It’s funny because meeting Bella and going into it, in the beginning, I felt like there was this tension between Mod and I … ” Mongeau said in the video. “Here I am just coming in and Bella wants me here but she has a whole a— boyfriend and he wasn’t my boyfriend and I didn’t want him to be my boyfriend. He didn’t want me to be his girlfriend. It was this weird thing of him and I sharing her. But after time, it became so harmonious and absolutely normal to us.”</p>
      <p>Thorne and Mongeau dated for over a year, and announced their <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/bella-thorne-tana-mongeau-broken-up">split publicly</a> in February 2019.</p>
      <p>“Being in that relationship taught me so much about myself and polyamory and openness and how close-minded the world can be – and how open-minded the world can be,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BpIai7IA2Lr/?utm_source=ig_embed">Mongeau said in a video</a>.</p>

      <h3>Mongeau and YouTuber Jake Paul tied the knot this year. Paul later confirmed the pair’s marriage was an “open” one during an interview with ET Live.</h3>

      <p>Paul and Mongeau got <a href="https://www.insider.com/timeline-of-jake-paul-and-tana-mongeaus-relationship-2019-6">married</a> this past <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tana-mongeau-jake-paul-wedding-date-vidcon-youtube-surprise-2019-7?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&amp;amp;_ga=2.242408450.1019193771.1573491782-820019448.1573065924">July.</a></p>
      <p>Paul confirmed in a later <a href="https://www.etonline.com/jake-paul-confirms-open-relationship-with-tana-mongeau-amid-noah-cyrus-attempted-hook-ups-exclusive">interview with ET Live</a> that the couple had always had an “open” arrangement after hosts Denny Directo and Cassie DiLaura questioned Paul about Mongeau and singer Noah Cyrus possibly hooking up.</p>
      <p>“Since the start of our relationship it’s been, like, an open type of thing because that’s just how we both are,” Paul said.</p>
      <p>The YouTuber added that he would be more than fine with his wife and Cyrus sleeping together, “especially if I could be there.”</p>

      <h3>‘Grace and Frankie’ actor Baron Vaughn has opened up about past non-monogamous relationships.</h3>

      <p>As with monogamous relationships, people approach polyamory and non-monogamy in different ways. Actor and comedian Baron Vaughn addressed this when speaking about his own experience in open relationships when he was a guest on the YouTube show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CcrD316hmw">Reality Bytes</a> in 2017</p>
      <p>“It can be daunting, it depends what you want out of it. And also what style you do, because there are many styles,” Vaughn said. “There’ve been a couple times where I’ve been in a triad, which is essentially an equilateral ‘throuple,’ some people might call it, where everyone was in a relationship with everyone else.”</p>
      <p>The actor also touched on the concept of “poly fidelity” in explaining his throuple – the idea that a person engaging in a triad relationship doesn’t date anyone aside from the other two people in the relationship.</p>
      <p>Vaugh appeared on an episode of Nicole Byer’s podcast <a href="https://headgum.com/why-wont-you-date-me/love-lust-and-infatuation-with-baron-vaughn">“Why Won’t You Date Me?”</a> earlier this year where he spoke about a long-distance open relationship he was in. Vaugn said jealousy wasn’t an issue for him.</p>
      <p>“Jealousy is a feeling that something you believe is yours is going to be taken from you,” Vaughn said. “Jealousy makes your partner an object.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>DeRay Davis, a comedian and actor known for his appearances in “21 Jumpstreet” and “Empire,” publicly displayed his “three-lationship” with his two girlfriends at the time when his Oxygen show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB3Iq9FzFmU">“Living with Funny”</a> premiered in 2016.</p>
      <p>Davis went on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW6zlG66Eh8">“The Real” in 2017</a> to discuss his polyamorous lifestyle further. After being asked how his girlfriends felt about the nature of the relationship, Davis said “They’re very comfortable, because I’m very open. I don’t make it where it’s all, ‘Oooh, look what I’m doing!’ I’m not a player.”</p>
      <p>The comedian opened up earlier this year about being poly for basically his entire dating life when he appeared on Nicole Byer’s podcast, <a href="https://headgum.com/why-wont-you-date-me/making-a-polyamorous-relationship-work-with-deray-davis">“Why Won’t You Date Me?,”</a> stating he has had multiple girlfriends at a time since he was 12-years-old.</p>
      <p>Davis explained that the process of meeting his multiple partners is “more of an organic thing,” rather than an intentional search for multiple partners.</p>
      <p>“I brought it upon myself to say ‘Hey, this is what my life is like. This is what I need,'” Davis told Byer of his approach to polyamory.</p>

      <p>Engaging in non-monogamous relationships can teach people about themselves in addition to providing the freedom to explore dating others.</p>
      <p>Lifestyle influencer, CEO, and author <a href="https://www.aubreymarcus.com/pages/about">Aubrey Marcus</a> speaks publicly about what he’s learned from his open relationship with his fiance, Whitney Miller. Marcus provides advice and tips on the complicated parts of non-monogamy like communication and <a href="https://www.aubreymarcus.com/blogs/aubrey-marcus/jealousy">dealing with jealousy</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m still learning every single day, things that are not trivial … This way is a way to teach me deep deep lessons about myself that I absolutely wouldn’t have gotten another way,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAHU2_OyPbg">Marcus said</a> in a podcast conversation with Miller about what they’ve learned in their open relationship.</p>
      <p>He still believes polyamory is not for everyone.</p>
      <p>“I am not an advocate for anyone being in an open relationship,” Marcus <a href="https://www.aubreymarcus.com/blogs/aubrey-marcus/open-relationship-resource-center">wrote on his website.</a> “It is a challenging way to learn about Love, learn about the self, and it is not for everyone. But the rewards have been immense for me. I just try to speak as honestly as I can about the subject and hopefully that helps some people out.”</p>
