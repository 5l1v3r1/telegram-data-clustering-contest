      <p>Johannesburg (AFP) - South African police detained more than 180 foreign nationals for storming the UN refugee agency in Pretoria, where they had been staging a sit-in protest, police said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of asylum-seekers started camping in front of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on October 8, asking to be relocated to another country after a spate of xenophobic violence in September.</p>
      <p>Protesters broke into the UNHCR premises on Thursday after they were informed of a court order giving them three days to vacate the site.</p>
      <p>"One hundred and eighty two men and one woman were taken into custody by the police at different police stations," said provincial police spokeswoman Mathapelo Peters in a statement on Saturday.</p>
      <p>They were being held on trespassing charges and were expected to appear before the Pretoria Magistrate Court on Monday, she added.</p>
      <p>The statement said police used water cannons to disperse the protesters, who retaliated with rocks and other objects.</p>
      <p>The sit-in was cleared and hundreds of women and children were bussed to a repatriation centre on the outskirts of Johannesburg as "temporary accommodation", said Peters.</p>
      <p>- 'Door open' for dialogue -</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) said it would not press charges against foreigners who attacked an archbishop and several others at a church in Cape Town on Friday.</p>
      <p>The foreigners -- many of whom also claim to be asylum-seekers -- had sought refuge at the church after they were evicted from a similar sit-in protest at a building hosting the UNHCR in Cape Town.</p>
      <p>They turned violent after they were told to leave.</p>
      <p>"I asked the police not to intervene," SAHRC commissioner Chris Nissen told AFP.</p>
      <p>"We want to leave the door open for negotiations and dialogue."</p>
      <p>The church was calm on Saturday, with some of the occupants slowly packing their belongings, said an AFP reporter.</p>
      <p>Officially, South Africa is home to 268,000 refugees and asylum seekers, according to government figures. They are mainly from Somalia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p>They say they suffer ill treatment and discrimination and want to be given a new life in another country.</p>
      <p>South Africa boasts some of the world's most progressive asylum policies, allowing foreigners to apply for refugee status and work during the process.</p>
      <p>But rights groups say the application system is flawed and backlogged, leaving many asylum-seekers stuck in limbo for years.</p>
      <p>As the continent's most industrialised economy, South Africa is also a magnet for economic migrants -- a situation that has stoked resentment among jobless South Africans and fuelled sporadic outbursts of xenophobic violence.</p>
