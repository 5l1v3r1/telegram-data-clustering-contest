      <p>A tightly contested gubernatorial election run-off in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana">Louisiana</a> on Saturday will test Donald Trump’s sway among conservative voters in the deep south as Democrat John Bel Edwards fights for a second term against Republican challenger Eddie Rispone.</p>
      <p>The election drew the president to northern Louisiana on Thursday evening for a campaign rally in Bossier City during which he urged Republican voters to turn up to the polls on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“This Saturday, the eyes of history are looking down on the great people of Louisiana,” Trump said, after spending much of his speech criticizing ongoing impeachment hearings in Washington. “It’s a close one. You gotta vote on Saturday. You’re gonna have a great Republican governor.”</p>
      <p>Early Saturday, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195690037461094407">tweeted</a> support for Rispone saying he would bring down taxes and auto insurance.</p>
      <p>The election marks the final governor’s race of the year, after Republicans achieved mixed results in other races in the American south, a region dominated by conservative politics. While holding onto the governor’s mansion in Mississippi, Republicans lost control of Kentucky last month. The incumbent Republican governor in Kentucky, Matt Bevin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/kentucky-governor-race-matt-bevin.html">finally conceded the race on Thursday</a>.</p>
      <p>The race in Louisiana, forced into a run-off after Edwards failed to gain over 50% of the vote in a primary election last month, has seen Rispone frame the election around national politics. He has sought to tie Edwards, a socially conservative Democrat <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/05/29/louisiana-passed-an-abortion-ban-its-democratic-governor-plans-defy-his-party-sign-it/">who signed one of the country’s most restrictive abortion bans into law</a>, to party leadership in Washington, paying little attention to Edwards’ state agenda.</p>
      <p>Edwards on the other hand, has tried to focus the race on state specific issues. Touting his record expanding Medicaid in the state, that <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/2146">brought around 460,000 people</a> in Louisiana health insurance, <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2019/06/03/louisiana-teachers-will-get-pay-raise-after-bill-wins-final-passage/">raising the pay of teachers</a>, and moves to stabilize the state’s imperiled economy.</p>
      <p>Recent polling has placed Edwards around <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/louisiana/">one percentage point ahead of Rispone</a>, a lead that is within the margin of error.</p>
      <p>As with other successful Democratic campaigns in the American south, Edwards will be dependent on high turnout from African American voters. There was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-louisiana-governors-race-looks-really-close/">a small drop</a> in the turnout of black voters during the primary last month compared with the 2015 election. This has lead Edwards to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-voter-outreach-intensifies-louisiana-governor-race-n1079491">intensify outreach</a> in black communities ahead of Saturday’s election.</p>
      <p>But the Democrat must also reach across the aisle and win a portion of conservative white voters if he wants to hold office.</p>
      <p>Rispone, a businessman and longtime Republican donor who has not held elected office previously, has sought to position himself as a political outsider in the same vein as Trump.</p>
      <p>“This is bigger than Louisiana,” Rispone told the rally on Thursday. “We have got to send a message to these liberal socialist Democrats in Washington that we support our president.”</p>
      <p>The election will also decide 24 state house seats and five state senate seats , which will determine whether Republicans seize a supermajority in the state legislature.</p>
