      <p>In Max Raid Battles, you and three other Trainers team up to take on a wild Dynamax Pokemon. In rare cases, Gigantamax Pokémon can appear instead, even though the chance is very small. But, some Gigantamax Pokemon become more common during specific time periods – like now.</p>
      <p>Nintendo said the Gigantamax Pokemon you’re likely to encounter will change over time.</p>
