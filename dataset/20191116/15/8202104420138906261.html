      <h3>People who cycle, ride the bus or think politicians talk too much will want to follow Monday’s Saskatoon city council meeting.</h3>

        <b>TWO-WHEEL RULES</b>
      </p>
      <p>Council will consider revisions to the city’s cycling bylaw, which dates back to 1988.</p>
      <p>Some of the key changes include allowing children under 14 to ride on sidewalks and requiring cyclists to use hand signals to indicate when they want to turn.</p>
      <p>The new rules include a one-metre buffer zone for motorists passing cyclists on two-way streets, but there is no mandatory helmet use provision.</p>
      <p>Randy Pshebylo, executive director of the Riversdale Business Improvement District, has written to city hall to express concern about allowing youth to ride bicycles on sidewalks.</p>
      <p>Pshebylo cited an incident in which an older woman was struck by a youth cyclist while she was leaving a business on 20th Street and suffered a broken hip. He attached a photo of paramedics attending to the woman.</p>
      <p>Pshebylo wants to know how the city plans to enforce safety for pedestrians.</p>
      <p>Lawyer Benjamin Ralston, who helped cycling advocacy group Saskatoon Cycles draft its submission for the bylaw, wrote to express “enthusiastic and unqualified support” for the new rules.</p>
      <p>Ralston said the one-metre buffer zone represents best practice and pointed to evidence that mandatory helmet rules may not achieve the desired goal of greater safety.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PAPER CHASE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The digital revolution will be tested on Monday as council votes on whether to retain paper detour notices posted at bus stops.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon Transit alerted bus riders this summer that an end to the practice of posting paper notices at bus stops was coming in October. Saskatoon Transit delayed eliminating paper notices until April in response to concerns that many bus riders lack smartphones or data plans.</p>
      <p>The plan would have shifted notices entirely to either the city’s website or the transit smartphone app. Paper notices would still be posted at the six bus terminals.</p>
      <p>The cost of posting paper notices at bus stops was estimated at $100,000 a year based on the cost of a manager driving to and from the bus stops to post and remove notices.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon Transit director Jim McDonald appeared before council’s transportation committee this month to explain that the posting system is inefficient, with information becoming outdated before the posts can be removed.</p>
      <p>The committee voted 4-2 in favour of retaining physical notices.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SPEECH LIMIT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Anyone who has attended or watched a Saskatoon city council meeting has become familiar with the five-minute speaking limit for guests and council members.</p>
      <p>Council will decide on Monday whether to apply that five-minute limit to civic politicians speaking at council’s four special policy committees and the governance and priorities committee that includes all councillors and the mayor.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is no time limit for council members speaking at committee meetings, although a five-minute limit for those addressing the committee is enforced.</p>
      <p>A city report points out that the four special policy committees took between 22 hours and 40 hours in 2018, depending on the committee. The policy committees include: transportation; finance; environment, utilities and corporate services; and planning, development and community services.</p>
      <p>Council will also ponder other options, including the status quo, a 10-minute limit at the governance and priorities committee or a five-minute limit at governance and priorities. Each of the committees meets once a month except for July.</p>
      <p>The governance and priorities committee replaced the executive committee in 2016. The rest of the committee structure dates back to 2014, when council meetings were reduced from twice a month.</p>
      <p>Council now usually meets on the last Monday of the month and splits its regular meeting from its public hearings.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TRANSIT DEAL</b>
      </p>
      <p>The City of Saskatoon and the union representing Saskatoon Transit employees have reached a deal.</p>
      <p>Council will vote Monday on whether to approve the collective agreement that was ratified this month by Amalgamated Transit Union Local 615. The 33-month deal, which expires at the end of this year, includes cumulative wage increases of 3.75 per cent.</p>
      <p>The previous transit union contract included a cumulative 10 per cent increase over slightly more than four years. That deal expired in the spring of 2017.</p>
      <p>The transit union deal resembles other collective agreements reached by city hall this year, with lower increases than in past deals.</p>
      <p>The impasse over the last transit contract resulted in a month-long lockout of transit employees by the city in the fall of 2014. The main sticking point in the last deal was changes to employees’ pension plans that mirrored concessions by other city unions.</p>
