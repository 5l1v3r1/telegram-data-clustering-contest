      <p>Katie Price's son Junior has hit back at a troll who slammed his mum's parenting skills on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Junior, 14, stuck up for <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/katie-price/">Katie</a> after someone left a scathing comment on dad <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/peter-andre/">Peter Andre's</a> video.</p>
      <p>In the clip, the Mysterious Girl singer and his daughter Princess, 12, are playing a game together at home.</p>

      <p>"Junior is always bopping around, so funny! Nice to see what real families do and not what Katie does which is use her kids to make the headlines! Sorry but had to be said," the comment read.</p>
      <p>After spotting it, an angry Junior replied: "U don't need to post negative stuff bout my mum."</p>
      <p>Following Junior's response, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/peter-andre/">Peter</a> turned the comments off on the clip altogether. ED has approached a representative for Peter for comment.</p>
      <p>Junior was only recently allowed to have his own Instagram account after Peter banned him from signing up, fearing his eldest kids would be opening themselves up to abuse from trolls.</p>

      <p>"The bullying I went through wasn’t like someone calling you names. I was beaten up pretty bad," he told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/">The Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>"I don’t let Princess or Junior go on social media or things like that yet. I am very strict, I don’t allow it in the house at all.</p>
      <p>"I worry about cyber bullying – all these things kids are going through, worrying about what they look like, worrying about what someone is saying about them."</p>

      <p>Just last month, the teen had to warn fans that someone was impersonating him on Snapchat and had been asking people to send inappropriate pictures.</p>
      <p>Junior shared a screengrab of the fake account to his Instagram Story, and wrote: "I have had ppl ask me if this is me. This is not me. This person is tryna claim it's me."</p>
      <p>He went on: "Reason I'm so disgusted is cuz they r tryna get u to send inappropriate pictures. N also sending them back claiming to be me. (sic)"</p>
      <p>Peter late said he was proud of his son for how he handled the situation.</p>
