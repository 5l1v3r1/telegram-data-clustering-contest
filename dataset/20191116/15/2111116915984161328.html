      <p>If you've already signed up for the new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/disney-plus-shows-movies-sign-up">Disney Plus</a> streaming service, then you may have noticed older episodes of The Simpsons are shown in the wrong aspect ratio. Disney now says a fix is on the way – but it won't arrive until next year.</p>
      <p>It's not that the episodes are unwatchable, but the forcing of the modern 16:9 widescreen look on the classic 4:3 seasons of the show means part of the picture is getting chopped off – and it's ruining some great visual gags.</p>
      <p>"We presented The Simpsons in 16:9 aspect ratio at launch in order to guarantee visual quality and consistency across all 30 seasons," Disney has said in a statement, as The Verge reports. "Over time, Disney Plus will roll out new features and additional viewing options."</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Netflix has renewed <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/netflixs-the-witcher-has-already-been-renewed-for-a-second-season">The Witcher</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/four-missing-marvel-movies-on-disney-plus-now-have-release-dates">More Marvel movies</a> are coming to Disney Plus</li>
        <li>Everything you need to know about <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/star-wars-the-mandalorian-trailers-release-date-cast-disney-plus">The Mandalorian</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>"As part of this, in early 2020, Disney Plus will make the first 19 seasons (and some episodes from season 20) of The Simpsons available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, giving subscribers a choice of how they prefer to view the popular series."</p>
      <h4>Classic viewing</h4>
      <p>So there you have it – you'll be able to view those classic Simpsons episodes as they were meant to be viewed early next year (with black letterbox bars on show to compensate.</p>
      <p>From season 20, which began airing on television in 2008, The Simpsons switched to the modern 16:9 widescreen ratio to fit with newer screens. It's a reminder of just how long the show has been around.</p>
      <p>Despite some initial teething problems, Disney Plus has attracted <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/disney-plus-has-10-million-subscribers-after-just-24-hours">millions of subscribers</a> in its launch markets of the US, Canada and the Netherlands, though the free trial might be something to do with that. A UK launch is scheduled for March, with Australia and New Zealand getting access next week.</p>
