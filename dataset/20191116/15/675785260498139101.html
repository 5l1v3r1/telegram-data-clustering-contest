      <h1>BBC to axe Newsround after 40 years as kids shun TV news</h1>
      <h2>It's the end of an era for the once-unmissable children's issues-focused television news service - with funding set to be redirected</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:54:51+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>The BBC is set to take Newsround off the air in the afternoon for good after a review found kids are shunning televised news coverage in favour of online news.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newsround">The iconic teatime edition of the show</a> is going to be removed after almost 50 years of service and after it was launched as John Craven’s Newsround in 1972.</p>
      <p>While it may be the end of an era for Newsround, it won’t be the end of the show completely as a morning bulletin will continue to air.</p>
      <p>And the BBC also says it will focus on adding more information and news to its online resources for children to consume at their leisure instead.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/16/bbc-scrap-teatimenewsround-bulletin/">According to The Telegraph,</a> the Beeb is looking at reducing overall children’s news on CBBC from 85 hours per year, to 35 hours per year.</p>
      <p>The paper reports that Ofcom has already accepted the BBC’s proposition and will be open for consultation.</p>
      <p>“We welcome the Ofcom consultation and if our proposals are approved we’ll still have at least one daily TV bulletin of Newsround at the same time as doubling our online offer, which is where more and more children are getting their news,” a spokesperson has said.</p>

      <p>Viewing numbers for child-focused BBC TV content is said to be down overall - with the Telegraph reporting that CBeebies is reaching only a third of it’s target audience.</p>
      <p>This number is even more dramatic for CBBC - with reports that just one in six target audience members are tuning in.</p>
      <p>The finger of blame is being pointed at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> and YouTube and other forms of video-on-demand services which provide hours of entertainment, leaving the BBC for dust.</p>

      <p>Ofcom is believed to be requesting assurance that the BBC will introduce safeguards to ensure their children's TV content remains of a high enough quality.</p>
      <p>It is being suggested the organisation should measure the success of new children's news content by measuring the impact it has with consumers.</p>
      <p>A statement revealing Ofcom’s decision is due to be released in early 2020.</p>
