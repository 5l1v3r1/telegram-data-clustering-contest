      <p>Near the Kyiv Botanical Garden, at the intersection of Nazarovska and Leo Tolstoi Streets, a man was spotted walking what seems to be a young leopard on a thick leash.</p>
      <p>That's according to UAnimals, a Kyiv-based animal protection initiative.</p>
      <p>"This species cannot and must not become a pet. Moreover, leopards are dangerous animals, and such 'walks' pose a threat to both the leopard and people," the report said.</p>
      <p>Keeping wild animals as pets is banned in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The NGO has appealed to locals to provide any information available on the individual who is keeping a predatory pet.</p>
