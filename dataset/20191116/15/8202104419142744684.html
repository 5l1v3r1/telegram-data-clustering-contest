      <h3>In recent years, South America has witnessed both progress and repression of Indigenous peoples.</h3>
      <p>Indigenous people form the majority population in many South and Central American countries. Over the years of Spanish and later settler colonialism, the people have been victims of exploitation and genocide.</p>
      <p>Fourteen years ago, Evo Morales became the President of Bolivia. He was a cocoa farmer and the son of a llama herder. He had known poverty all his life and worked as an activist for a better life for Bolivia’s Indigenous people, who were 60 per cent of the country’s population.</p>
      <p>During his tenure as leader, he raised the standard of living for the poor people, nationalized the oil and gas industry and used the profits for public works and social programs. He also worked with his government to create a new constitution that made Bolivia a plurinational and secular state that recognized Bolivia’s Indigenous population and their spirituality.</p>
      <p>Naturally, his economic policies raised the ire of the United States and the Christian settler community reacted passionately against his move to create a multicultural state. Bolivia has enormous reserves of lithium. Morales wanted to nationalize the resource, but in the end the new government cut a deal with the Chinese.</p>
      <p>Also, the Christian right was incensed that Christianity wasn’t the only religion recognized in the constitution.</p>
      <p>Morales was replaced in a right-wing coup and he has since fled the country, fearing for his life. He was replaced by Jeanine Anez Chavez, a Christian fundamentalist who stated that Bolivia was free from “satanic Indigenous rites.” She held up a bible, stating that “the bible has returned to the palace.” She further stated that the Indigenous people should leave the cities and go to the highlands or Chaco, the lowland jungles.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Indigenous resistance is growing in the streets.</p>
      <p>Next door to Bolivia, in Brazil, the new president, Jair Bolsanaro, is a right-wing nationalist referred to as the Trump of the tropics. He severely cut the budget of the department of Indigenous affairs and threatened to get rid of the department entirely. He also placed Indian lands on the block for purchase, vowing that the Indians should not have a single square centimetre of land.</p>
      <p>He sees Indigenous people as an impediment to progress and has stated, “There is no Indigenous territory where there aren’t minerals. Gold, tin and magnesium are in these lands, especially in the Amazon, the richest area in the world. I’m not getting into this nonsense of defending land for Indians.”</p>
      <p>He has further mused that the Americans did a much better job of clearing out the Indians, saying, “It’s a shame that the Brazilian cavalry hasn’t been as efficient as the Americans, who exterminated the Indians.”</p>
      <p>Currently groups of miners and loggers are attacking and killing Indigenous people on their lands and doing it with impunity.</p>
      <p>Over the mountains in Ecuador, the Indigenous peoples — who, combined with the Mestizos, comprise close to 80 per cent of the population — have been demonstrating throughout this fall in the capital city of Quito. The demonstrations are related to living conditions and government austerity, but environmental issues cast an important shadow.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Indigenous people won a historic court decision to prevent oil exploration and development of about a half million acres of valuable Amazon rain forest. The government has now reversed its austerity package, but the environmental issues remain.</p>
      <p>Our First Nations brothers and sisters in South and Central America are facing a growing wave of white supremacy and backlash to environmental activism. If Brazil’s Bolsonaro has his way, our people in the Amazon face genocide and the destruction of their homeland.</p>
      <p>We are witnessing an attack on our people the scale of which hasn’t been seen in 200 years.</p>
      <p>In Bolivia, the tide has turned against the reforms of the Morales government and the Indigenous people face a bleak future as power shifts to the settler class and poverty and repression return to our people.</p>
      <p>As an Indigenous person, I regard an attack against our people anywhere in the hemisphere as an attack on all. We are all victims of European colonialism and our future and the health of the planet are intertwined.</p>
