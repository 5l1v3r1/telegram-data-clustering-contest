        <b>Two men who reside in the Corporate Area have been charged for the brazen daylight killing of a man while he played dominoes in Manchester two weeks ago.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mario Martin, 43, a mason of Cassia Crescent, in Olympic Gardens, St Andrew, and Jesse Reynolds, 32, a janitor of Water Street, in Denham Town, west Kingston, have been charged with murder, conspiracy to murder and illegal possession of firearm and ammunition.</p>
      <p>They were formally charged on Thursday after they were pointed out during an identification parade, the police disclosed.</p>
      <p>It’s reported that about 11:00a.m. on November 2, Cornel Whitfield, a mason of Clarke’s Town Road, in Mandeville, was among a group of persons at a shop playing dominoes  when he was surprised by two men armed with guns.</p>
      <p>It’s reported that the men, who were travelling on foot, opened fire, hitting him several times before making their escape. No one else was injured.</p>
