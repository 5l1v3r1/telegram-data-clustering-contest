      <p>The Anambra State Police Command says it has smashed a kidnapping syndicate terrorising the state, and arrested two suspected top members.</p>
      <p>The Command’s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Haruna Mohammed, a superintendent of police (SP) said Saturday that the arrest followed a fierce gun battle with the criminals.</p>
      <p>Mohammed said that police also recovered one revolver pistol, four live ammunition, and a victim’s body.</p>
      <p>He said the gun battle between the police and the syndicate took place on Friday, at Owerrinta, Abia State.</p>
      <p>According to him, the shootout took place when the abductors came to collect N3 million ransom from the victim’s family.</p>
      <p>“Following actionable intelligence, Puff-Adder operatives, in conjunction with the Command’s Special Anti robbery Squad (SARS), tracked and arrested at Aro Ngwa, Owerrinta in Abia State, one Anthony Robbert ‘m’ 25 years.</p>
      <p>“Robert was arrested alongside one Udoka Nwoko ‘m’ 27 years, after a fierce gun battle.</p>
      <p>“The two suspects were fatally wounded during the encounter,’’ it said.</p>
      <p>The command’s spokesman said the encounter followed the kidnap of one Amaechi Ike ‘m’, at Awada in Onitsha, Anambra.</p>

      <p>“The suspects later collected N3 million ransom from his family, and still went ahead to kill the victim (Ike),” he said.</p>
      <p>Mohammed stated that the suspects voluntarily confessed to the crime and immediately took Police detectives to a shallow grave, where they buried the victim.</p>
      <p>He said that the corpse was exhumed and recovered as exhibit and later deposited at a morgue.</p>
      <p>The PPRO said that police recovered one locally-made revolver pistol and four live ammunition from the suspects.</p>
      <p>He said the suspects had since been taken to the hospital for medical attention; and they would be charged to court after investigation.</p>
      <p>The PRO used the medium to re-assure the public of Anambra Commissioner of Police, Mr John Abang’s readiness to combat crime in the state.</p>
      <p>He appealed to residents to always provide useful information that would assist the Police in protecting lives and property of all citizens.</p>
