      <h1>How you should best use a team’s record against the spread</h1>

      <p>Is Ohio State’s gaudy 8-1 record against the point-spread (ATS) an early indicator for a national championship?</p>
      <p>You might think that’s a questionable query. But Louisiana-Lafayette is also 8-1 ATS, and nobody’s talking about the Ragin’ Cajuns in those terms. Records against the spread reflect performance versus expectations, not necessarily overall team quality.</p>
      <p>But what about obviously very good or great teams that consistently outperform high expectations? Could that impressive combination mean something? Heading into Saturday’s game at Rutgers (3:30 p.m., BTN), the Buckeyes are following in the footsteps of other recent champions.</p>
      <p>LSU went 11-2 ATS in advance of its 2003 national championship. Vince Young and Texas matched that 11-2 ATS performance with their 2005 title. Ditto for Tim Tebow and Florida in 2008. Schedule length increased after that. Auburn’s 2010 championship team finished 10-4 ATS. Florida State ended 11-3 ATS in 2013. Ohio State went 10-5 ATS the following season.</p>
      <p>Alabama’s 2017 title team finished just 6-8 ATS, the only record below .500 in the past 11 seasons, according to the pull-down standings pages at Covers.com. Going back to 2003, national champions finished their seasons 137-82-1, for a sterling 63 percent mark against the spread.</p>
      <p>Point spreads are supposed to be the great equalizer. History has shown that the eventual champions are often underestimated by the composite sum of market influences, even when they’re media-friendly, high-profile programs. Consistently clearing high expectations is a sign of greatness.</p>
      <p>Current ATS records for the top 10 teams in this week’s playoff rankings: Ohio State 8-1, Minnesota 6-2-1, Clemson 7-3, LSU 6-3, Utah 6-3, Georgia 5-4, Oregon 5-4, Penn State 5-4, Alabama 4-5, Oklahoma 4-5. In fairness, Minnesota hasn’t been clearing “high” hurdles, and will have to string together upsets to maintain dark-horse status. Ohio State, Clemson, and LSU are obviously thoroughbreds. Utah’s loss at USC suggest the Utes probably aren’t.</p>
      <p>Should handicappers use ATS records when picking games? Though this championship indicator is interesting, VSiN still suggests you use them to evaluate “the market” rather than teams.</p>
      <p>Don’t think, “Louisiana-Lafayette must be fantastic, it’s covered 89 percent of the time.” Instead, ask what the market’s been missing about Louisiana-Lafayette. Whey are the Ragin’ Cajuns so underrated? Has the line finally caught up, or is there still value?</p>
      <p>If the line has caught up, then earlier ATS results are just trivia. Maybe Louisiana-Lafayette (or Ohio State) was underrated, but won’t be moving forward. Successful handicapping is always about reading teams and pricing.</p>
      <p>You already know who’s 8-1 ATS this season. Here are other money-makers entering the week:</p>
      <p>7-2 ATS: Auburn, Kansas State, Oklahoma State, Tulane. 6-2 ATS: Navy and Minnesota (Gophers actually 6-2-1). 7 -3 ATS: Clemson, Central Michigan, Florida Atlantic, Illinois, Western Kentucky.</p>
      <p>6-3 ATS: LSU, Utah, Appalachian State, Ball State, Cincinnati, Colorado State, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana Tech, Memphis, Oregon State, Pittsburgh, San Jose State, Utah, Wyoming.</p>
      <p>It’s not too early to start handicapping the Final Four. Respecting useful indicators will help you bet smart.</p>
