      <h1>Mandryk: Moe's historic week could be good or very bad</h1>
      <h2>A year from now, we could very well be pointing to another development this week that was a tide-turner for the premier and his government.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:00:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/mmandryk" target="_blank">Murray Mandryk</a></address>
      <p>A year from now, Premier Scott Moe will likely become the first Saskatchewan Party leader to lose seats in a general election … which is probably has less significance than such a statement seems to suggest.</p>
      <p>It’s been a remarkable 22-year run for the Sask. Party, that went from eight seats at its inception in 1997 to 25 seats in its first general election in 1999 to 28 seats in 2003 to 38 seats and government in 2007 to 49 seats in 2011 to 51 seats in 2016. If anything, the loss of seats would seem an inevitability for what should now be considered Saskatchewan’s natural governing party in the 21st century.</p>
      <p>What was a 51-seat caucus after the 2016 vote has been reduced to a 46-seat Sask. Party government that has already lost three members this term through byelection losses and two more to federal Conservative candidacies.</p>
      <p>Clearly, Moe has inherited from Brad Wall a solid majority, an even more solid rural base and the crown of the most popular premier in Canada he has continued to wear. And given that he also inherited a significant 2017-18 Saskatchewan budget mess with a deficit approaching a billion dollars, Moe already deserves credit for restoring any slippage in support. He has been politically successful in his relentless attack on highly-unpopular-in-Saskatchewan Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his federal Liberal government policies like the largely unworkable carbon tax.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Moe <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/sask-party-pledges-to-help-farmers-as-part-of-new-growth-plan">unveiled Thursday morning at a Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce breakfast </a>his new <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/budget-planning-and-reporting/plan-for-growth">Saskatchewan growth plan for 2030 </a>that calls for 200,000-plus more people and 100,000 more jobs in the next decade — <a href="https://twitter.com/PremierScottMoe/status/1195351442812354560?s=20">ambitious goals</a>, no doubt, but ones that afford 2020 provincial voters hope.</p>
      <p>Yet there is also a sense that we saw a potential tide-turner this week in his trip to Ottawa to meet with Trudeau. Perhaps it will be seen a year from now as the very thing that solidified another Sask. Party government majority.</p>
      <p>However, it’s also possible that history may also one day show Moe simply overplayed his hand and widened the schisms not only in provincial politics between rural and urban but also the national divide between East and and West.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/PremierScottMoe/status/1194338033384009728?s=20">Moe took cheeky umbrage</a> to the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/separatism-not-the-answer-says-moe-while-refusing-to-denounce-views?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573691505">column in this space three days ago questioning whether he went to Ottawa spoiling for a fight with Trudeau</a>, but it’s crystal clear that the Saskatchewan premier went to Ottawa at least looking for a meme or sound byte of him sounding tough with Trudeau.</p>
      <p>This certainly has in-the-moment appeal, given that it plays to the Sask. Party base and province as a whole that have ample reason to be mad at the Trudeau government.</p>
      <p>But what Moe and his Sask. Party strategists may be be missing is that not everyone in 2020 will casting their vote based on how mad they are at Trudeau and the federal Liberals. Some might even be recalling Moe’s Ottawa performance as pure partisan theatrics … or downright misleading, given that the prime minister’s office released its own version of the Moe meeting suggesting Trudeau actually afforded Moe the opportunity for weighty discussion on issues of national importance.</p>
      <p>One such issue is the dicey matter of<a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/separatism-not-the-answer-says-moe-while-refusing-to-denounce-views?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_me"> western separation talk that Moe still won’t outright condemn. </a>There were two motions on the floor of the Saskatchewan legislature this week condemning federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, and Moe still feels he can’t outright condemn those wanting to tear our country apart? Does this sound a bit like partisan politics?</p>
      <p>For as well as this might play right now, the patience for high-stakes political grandstanding may be wearing thin. There are even rumours that the Sask. Party caucus itself is split between those concerned about losing city seats and the amount of alienation/separation talk and those in caucus eager to feed the latter.</p>
      <p>This week, Moe could have and should have stood up to Trudeau, but in a way that spoke to both voters beyond his base and to national unity.</p>
      <p>And the Sask. Party might not see the problem until the 2020 election results come in a year from now.</p>
