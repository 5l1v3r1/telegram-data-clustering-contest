      <p>EDMONTON – Alberta opposition leader Rachel Notley addressed NDP members at a bi-annual council in Edmonton Saturday.</p>
      <p>Notley railed on Premier Jason Kenney about his recently released provincial budget, saying he broke many of the promises he campaigned on.</p>
      <p>"They are cutting teachers, cutting support and cutting classroom resources," said Notley. "He’s taking money away from the most vulnerable Albertans."</p>
      <p>Notley went on to call the budget mean-spirited, and a betrayal on promises made by Premier Kenney.</p>
      <p>“We’ll pay more for insurance, vehicle registration, power prices, school fees and  property taxes," she continued. “And that’s just the start.”</p>
      <p>Commenting on Kenney’s fight on equalization, Notley called it a distraction.</p>
      <p>"This is irresponsible. But it’s also cynical and it’s calculated. It’s designed to distract," she continued. "He’s [Kenney] like an amateur magician at an office Christmas party."</p>
