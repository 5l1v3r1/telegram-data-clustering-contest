      <p>According to reports, a white 19-year-old teller robbed an elderly man who reportedly made a significant withdrawal from the bank.</p>
      <p>Michael Newell is being charged with assault, burglary, robbery, and home invasion after attacking the 79-year-old and his 57-year-old stepdaughter. Newell reportedly forced his way into the man’s Bel Air home with a mask on and strangled the man as he asked where the money was at. While that was happening, Newell was put in a headlock by the stepdaughter, according to court records.</p>
      <p>Newell allegedly escaped while the woman ran to get help, and the man who was assaulted told the cops that the attacker looked like the bank teller after seeing the robber’s mask fall off. As a result, Newell was arrested at Freedom Federal Credit Union and later admitted to the attack. He said he was “tired of working two jobs.”</p>
