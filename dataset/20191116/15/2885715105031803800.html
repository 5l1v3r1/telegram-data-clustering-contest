      <p>A <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> fan managed to sneak into the ground on Day of the 1st Test between India and Bangladesh in Indore on Saturday, also managing to get close enough to touch the Indian skipper’s feet and get a word with him.</p>
      <p>Kohli was seen reacting to the incident by putting his arm around the fan’s shoulder in a gesture of protection as security personnel came running after the fan.</p>
      <p>The fan was then taken away by the security personnel, but Kohli was seen being concerned about the fan’s well-being, as he was seen saying something to the guards.</p>
