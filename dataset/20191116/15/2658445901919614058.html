      <p>A man has been arrested for allegedly digging up his parents’ bodies so he can exchange their bones for a motorbike.</p>
      <p>Police in Mozambique, Africa have detained a man in the northern Nampula province on suspicion of exhuming the bodies of his parents and an uncle.</p>
      <p>The man is reported to have removed their bones in one night after a businessman promised him a motorcycle and more than $300 (£234) in cash.</p>

      <p>He told the BBC: ‘The boss told me to look for bones from people who died without getting sick. In exchange, you will get a motorbike.</p>
      <p>‘I went to a family cemetery, dug up the bones from my father’s, my mother’s and my uncle’s graves.’</p>
      <p>The man is reported to have travelled to meet the businessman, who is involved in the exploration of mineral resources, but he was not there.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said the incident was the fifth such case in the area this year, with most believed linked to witchcraft.</p>
