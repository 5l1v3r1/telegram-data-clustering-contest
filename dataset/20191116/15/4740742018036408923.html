      <h1>Why Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks &amp; Spencer could be left with empty shelves</h1>
      <h2>Workers could be going on strike over pay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:40:24+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Matty Hewitt, Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Workers at a food factory which prepares meals for leading supermarkets are planning to go on strike.</p>
      <p>A total of 83 per cent of staff at Bakkavor have voted for strike action in a dispute over pay.</p>
      <p>The strike could mean the loss of popular meals including salad meals, wraps, soups and dips on the shelves in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/tesco">Tesco</a> , <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/sainsburys">Sainsbury's</a> and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/marks-spencer">M&amp;S</a>.</p>
      <p>Unite union has said workers are now preparing to walk-out in protest over a proposed 1.5 per cent pay increase, <a href="https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/local-news/tesco-sainsburys-ms-co-op-3537145">Lincolnshire Live reports</a> .</p>
      <p>A member of the union, who wished to remain anonymous, has reportedly said the strike will take place during December.</p>
      <p>Unite regional officer Mick Orpin said: "The UK’s leading supermarkets face the prospect of considerable disruption to the supply of popular products like hummus and taramasalata over the festive season.</p>
      <p>“Bosses at Bakkavor have absolutely no justification for suppressing workers’ pay year on year when the company has increased its profits year on year.</p>
      <p>“Between 2014 and 2018, Bakkavor’s profits have increased by a massive £40 million but management have left hard-up workers with no choice except to take strike action to fight for their fair share.</p>
      <p>“There is still time left to resolve this dispute and we hope management will get around the negotiating table with a view to reaching an agreement which recognises the workers’ contribution to the success of the business.”</p>
      <p>Bakkavor have been contacted for a comment.</p>
