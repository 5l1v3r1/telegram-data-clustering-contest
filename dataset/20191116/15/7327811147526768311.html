      <p>EAST WINDSOR, Connecticut -- A 40-year-old Connecticut man has been charged in the death of his father.</p>
      <p>The Hartford Courant <a href="https://www.courant.com/breaking-news/hc-br-east-windsor-homicide-arrest-20191116-2jralhazozhyxpg7slwf4u3gey-story.html">reports </a>that Gabriel Hesse, of East Windsor, was arrested at his Main Street home Friday evening and charged with murder.

      <p>Police said he had been stabbed multiple times. His death was ruled a homicide.</p>
      <p>Gabriel Hesse is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Enfield Superior Court.</p>
