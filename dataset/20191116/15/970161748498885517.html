      <p>Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas has blessed everyone with an adorable video of his daughter Scarlett meeting Little Mix.</p>
      <p>We can’t deal.</p>
      <p>The actor, who played Jason Grimshaw in the soap, took his little one to see the girls – Jesy Nelson, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, and Jade Thirlwall – backstage at one of their shows.</p>
      <p>Placing her hand over her mouth in shock, the 9-year-old could be seen walking towards the girls down a corridor, with the four of them giving her hugs and complimenting her outfit.</p>

      <p>Sharing a gorgeous snap of them all, with his daughter looking like the fifth member of the band, Ryan thanked the girls.</p>

      <p>‘You can only imagine that feeling of being a child meeting someone like this for the first time and how it makes you feel as a father watching the excitement on her face,’ the 35-year-old wrote.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you to all the girls for making Scarletts night [heart emoji] @littlemix.’</p>
      <p>And Jesy had high praise for her, commenting on Jason’s post: ‘She’s too cute.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the girl band have plenty to celebrate after it was reported that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/03/salute-little-mix-girl-group-become-x-factors-richest-winners-10855151/">they’ve become the X Factor’s richest winners after earning a whopping £9 million last year.</a></p>
      <p>As a group the members have raked in more than £30 million collectively since winning X Factor.</p>

      <p>According <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10048853/little-mix-made-paid-millions/">to The Sun</a> the only X Factor champ that has come close to the group in terms of earnings is apparently Leona Lewis, who won the show in 2006.</p>
      <p>Not too shabby.</p>
      <p>However, they’re now set to go head-to-head with the very show that kicked off their careers,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/simon-cowell-admits-launched-x-factor-band-get-ahead-little-mix-didnt-want-follow-show-11083255/"> after Simon Cowell announced X Factor: The Band</a>, as he searches for the UK’s next musical group.</p>
      <p>With a premise similar to the show Little Mix announced they’d be airing next year, there’s sure to be competition between the pair.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/simon-cowell-putting-pressure-on-himself-to-beat-little-mix-for-x-factor-the-band-as-he-opens-up-on-rivalry-11087745/">Speaking to press on the red carpet for the ITV Palooza</a>, Cowell admitted that he’s put himself in a rather stressful situation. ‘You have to put pressure on yourself,’ the 60-year-old told Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>‘When I saw that [Little Mix] were bringing [their] show forward, I thought “we’re going to have to bring [our] show forward.”‘</p>
      <p>‘It’s not about the time pressure,’ he admitted. ‘It’s making sure we get the right people.’</p>
