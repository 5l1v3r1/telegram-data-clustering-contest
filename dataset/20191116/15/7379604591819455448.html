It has been confirmed that there are 275 Brexit Party candidates running, after leader Nigel Farage initially suggested that his party would target every seat in Britain. But Ben Habib has suggested that his party may have made the wrong decision in standing down so many candidates. “Well I think with the benefit of hindsight maybe we shouldn't have stood 317 candidates down, with the benefit of hindsight, because the Tories haven't responded positively to it. “They haven't stood down and assured a proper Leave mandate in Parliament.”</li>

Jeremy Corbyn is still hammering out the details of his party manifesto in central London. And Jo Swinson was snapped spinning pizza dough at a cafe in London, looking rather like a professional.</li>

It's electric and typically orange. Earlier today she also planted a tree in North London at a campaign event, to highlight the Lib Dem pledge to plant 60 million trees a year if they gain power.</li>

He said: “The idea of Jeremy Corbyn winning and becoming Prime Minister, one in a million. It's not going to happen. “So I think we're faced with either a Johnson majority, it could happen. Although I think more likely, no majority, but hung in a different way, with more of us and more SNP.”</li>
