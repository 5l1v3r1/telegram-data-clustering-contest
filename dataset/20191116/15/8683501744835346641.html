      <p>In the weeks since its release, <i>Joker</i> has achieved phenomenal feats at the box office. It recently became the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484350/holy-cash-cow-batman-joker-is-now-the-most-profitable-comic-book-movie-of-all-time">most profitable comic book film</a> ever -- and this weekend, it’s slated to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484942/joker-is-officially-crossing-the-1-billion-mark">cross the $1 billion dollar</a> threshold. What’s even more surprising, though, is how much Joaquin Phoenix initially pocketed to play the film’s titular antihero, especially given how much some other movie stars made in 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/celebrity-salaries-leonardo-dicaprio-margot-robbie-dwayne-johnson-will-smith-1203200508/">Variety</a> reported on some of the most notable salaries for Hollywood stars this year. According to the magazine, Joaquin Phoenix made $4.5 million for the work he did in <i>Joker</i>. Very few people would argue that’s a small amount of money, and it’s definitely not the lowest salary on the list -- that belongs to Jessica Chastain, whose salary for <i>It: Chapter 2</i> was reportedly $2.5 million. But Joaquin Phoenix’s salary is still low in comparison to many other actors this year.</p>
      <p>Martin Lawrence, for example, made $6 million for next year’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/bad-boys-for-life-66927.html"><i>Bad Boys For Life</i></a>. Kristen Stewart netted $7 million for her performance in <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484774/charlies-angels-star-kristen-stewart-loves-that-the-angels-start-the-movie-as-strangers">the <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> reboot</a>. Ben Affleck and Idris Elba both made $8 million for Netflix’s <i>Triple Frontier</i> and <i>Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw</i>, respectively. And the stars of <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476420/brad-pitt-and-leonardo-dicaprio-remind-everyone-they-were-on-the-same-tv-show">Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt</a><i>,</i> each took home $10 million.</p>
      <p>Even <i>those</i> salaries are low compared to some of Hollywood’s top earners this year. At $17 million, Will Smith’s <i>Bad Boys For Life</i> salary was much higher than his co-star’s. Dwayne Johnson raked in $20 million for <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i>, while Robert Downey Jr. scored a similar salary for the upcoming <i>The Voyage of Doctor Doolittle</i>. And Ryan Reynolds -- who recently made fans chuckle with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483197/ryan-reynolds-had-the-best-response-to-jokers-box-office-success">his response</a> to <i>Joker</i>’s success -- earned $27 million for his Netflix project, <i>Six Underground</i>.</p>
      <p>On the surface, it might seem pretty unfair that Joaquin Phoenix’s salary represents such a small portion of <i>Joker</i>’s revenue. But Variety points out that more often than not, actors negotiate contracts that ensure a percentage of their film’s profits in addition to their base salary. One notable exception to that practice is Netflix deals, which stipulate that an actor’s salary won’t include profit sharing. In other words, even if Ryan Reynolds' and Ben Affleck's Netflix films end up with record-breaking streams, they won’t see another dime.</p>
      <p>If <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483698/joaquin-phoenix-made-a-wonderfully-creative-argument-for-a-joker-sequel">Joaquin Phoenix</a> made a backend deal for <i>Joker</i> -- and let’s be real, he almost certainly did -- then his overall profit for the film could make that original $4.5 million look like chump change. And that money probably won’t dry up anytime soon. <i>Joker</i> is still showing in theaters worldwide, and it will almost certainly find similar success on the home entertainment front.</p>
