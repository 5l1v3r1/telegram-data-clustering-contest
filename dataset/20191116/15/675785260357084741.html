      <h2>WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES The nail salon customer has now issued a warning to others after she was diagnosed with a fungal infection by her doctor</h2>

      <p>A woman has issued a warning after she claims her a salon nail <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manicure">manicure</a> left her with a horrific fungal infection.</p>
      <p>Bethany, who asked not to be identified by her last name, said she got a dip powder manicure on October 17.</p>
      <p>She did not identify the salon where she had the procedure but said her finger had been cut during her appoitnment.</p>
      <p>Just a week later, Bethany claimed her fingers were swollen, bloody and oozing pus.</p>
      <p>After booking in to see a doctor, Bethany was told she had a fungal infection, that she could have caught by dipping her fingers into the same powder that several other customers had also used.</p>
      <p>It is not been proven that the manicure was the definite cause, but Bethany believes it was the cut on her nail that resulted in her hands becoming infected.</p>

      <p>A dip manicure is a nail technique where a person picks a coloured powder and then dips their nails into a jar.</p>
      <p>The technician will then brush off any excess powder, put a protective coat on tip and repeat until the polish has hardened.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But at a salon, a technician should paint the powder onto the client's nails - or divide the powder into smaller pots that are individual to each customer - to keep things hygienic.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slfDOOVY6f0&amp;feature=player_embedded">WFMY News 2</a> , Bethany explained that while her nails were being filed, the manicurist accidentally cut one of her fingers, but her nails were still dipped into the container of powder.</p>

      <p>She said: "I noticed about a week later I had little spots come up [around a few nails] and tried creams over-the-couner and then soaked them in alcohol and peroxide and it just kept getting worse."</p>
      <p>Pictures provided by Bethany, who lives in Greensboro, North Carolina, showed her fingers looking incredibly sore and swollen, some even oozing pus from the nail beds.</p>
      <p>Bethany now claims she will never go to a nail salon again.</p>
