      <p>The 38-year-old announced on Wednesday evening that he would be leaving the Major League Soccer outfit after two seasons in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Clubs in Serie A and Manchester United have been heavily linked with the Swedish veteran, but Atalanta president Antonio Percassi says they can't afford the striker.</p>
      <p>“Ibrahimovic is a great player, but we can't afford him,” Percassi told Italian news agency ANSA.</p>
      <p>“We are mere paupers…</p>
      <p>“We don't have the revenue of the big clubs, although miraculously we get the results and remain a provincial reality keeping our feet on the ground.</p>
      <p>“We can't compete with certain figures.</p>
      <p>“We've got clear ideas regarding the stadium and have to complete the Zingonia training centre. We still need some millions and we have already spent £3.4m on the Bortolotti Centre.”</p>
