      <h1>Record number of women to stand in general election</h1>

        <i>Over a third of candidates are female and Labour is first main party to field majority of women</i>
      </p>
      <p>A record number of female candidates are expected to stand in next month’s general election, with women making up a third of nominations.</p>
      <p>More than 1,100 women have registered as candidates, 34% of the total, marking an increase from 29% in 2017 and 26% in 2015.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> party has become the first major political party in the UK to offer a majority of female candidates, with 53% of nominated candidates women – an 11% increase since the last election.</p>
      <p>Women make up 30% of the Conservative nominations, up just 1% since 2017, while the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats">Liberal Democrats</a> have increased their gender balance by 29% since the last election, to reach 31%.</p>
      <p>Of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/11/caroline-lucas-calls-for-emergency-female-cabinet-to-block-no-deal-brexit">Green party</a>’s candidates, 41% are female – the second highest of the major parties – followed by the Scottish National party’s 34%. A quarter of Plaid Cymru’s candidates are women, with the Brexit party fielding 20%.</p>
      <p>The increase puts the total number of female candidates at 1,120, compared with 973 at the last general election.</p>
      <p>There are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/02/labour-mp-gloria-de-piero-urges-women-to-change-parliament">211 female </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/02/labour-mp-gloria-de-piero-urges-women-to-change-parliament">MPs</a>, just over a third of the total number, placing the UK 39th in the world for the proportion of women in the lower house of parliament.</p>
      <p>According to the latest government report, the figure also puts the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons">House of Commons</a> at the joint lowest gender balance out of the national assembly for Wales (42%), Scottish parliament (36%) and Northern Ireland assembly (32%).</p>
      <p>Frances Scott, the founder and director of 50:50 Parliament, an organisation campaigning for gender balance at Westminster, said she was pleased to see the increase, but emphasised there was still a lot of work to be done.</p>
      <p>“The fight for political equality is still on,” she said. “Our parliament should draw upon the widest pool of talent, including the 32 million women in the UK – their contributions are just as valuable as men’s.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/more-women-wanted-in-parliament-archive-1920">Since women could first stand in a general election</a>, over 5,000 MPs have been elected, of which less than 500 have been women.”</p>
      <p>Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, a charity that campaigns for women’s rights and gender equality, described the figures as a “missed opportunity”.</p>
      <p>“We need a step change in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/14/westminster-progress-on-toxic-culture-still-too-slow-two-years-on-inappropriate-behaviour">women’s representation</a>. These figures won’t deliver that. Rather than celebrating, I think that most parties should be asking themselves why they haven’t selected more women,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It’s the best chance they had in years to select significantly more women and they blew it.”</p>
