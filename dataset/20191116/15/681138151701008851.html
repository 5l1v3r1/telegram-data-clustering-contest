        <b>Gritters will be in action treating the roads across Suffolk and north Essex tonight as temperatures are set to plummet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both Suffolk and Essex Highways are sending gritters out into the night as frosty weather and temperatures as low as -1C could cause problems across the two counties.</p>
      <p>Adam Drury, a forecaster from Weatherquest, said it is expected to be a dry night with clear skies and "temperatures very close to freezing".</p>
      <p>He said: "Temperatures in Suffolk are expected to drop between 0C and 1C. While in Essex and in parts of south west Suffolk temperatures could reach -1C."</p>
      <p>These colder temperatures will cause a ground frost, with Adam explaining that "the ground cools down quicker than the air surrounding it".</p>
      <p>Suffolk Highways said they will be sending gritters out overnight to deal with the drop in temperature.</p>
      <p>They tweeted: "It's going to be a cold one tonight! Our gritters will be out treating the roads countywide from 8pm as road surface temperatures are due to fall below 1Â°C during the night and into Sunday morning. Travel safe all and have a fantastic weekend."</p>
      <p>Essex Highways also tweeted the news that their gritters will be out on the roads.</p>
      <p>According to Adam, the low temperatures will cause some ground frost early on Sunday morning, with a little mist and fog first thing.</p>
      <p>He added: "Sunday afternoon will start off fairly sunny with some cloud thickening into the afternoon and a few showers possible.</p>
      <p>"Temperatures will reach around 7C."</p>
