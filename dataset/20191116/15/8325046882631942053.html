      <p>Hopp said she especially recommends using these to decorate for Hanukkah, <a href="https://www.insider.com/elf-fun-facts-2018-12">Christmas</a>, or in homes that celebrate both holidays.</p>
      <p>“These will look great paired together on a table or bookshelf, or distributed throughout your home,” she said.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>According to Hopp, stockings should be the focal point of a space without being too ornate or thematic. To achieve that look, she recommends these gold hooks because “they have a chic silhouette and simple elegance” about them.</p>

      <p>When it comes to holiday wreaths, Hopp said you should go big or go home.</p>
      <p>“In the case of a wreath, bigger is better,” she told Insider. “An oversized wreath above your fireplace or dining table will create an instant showstopper focal point in the room, and take your holiday home decor to the next level.”</p>

      <p>All <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-famous-drinks-got-their-names-2019-6">holiday cocktails</a> deserve a special glass since they can help visually elevate any drink, Hopp told Insider.</p>
      <p>Her pick is these gold-rimmed or silver-rimmed glass cups that offer an “extra dose of glitz” while still having a classic style.</p>

      <p>When it comes to home decor that is suited for the holidays, Hopp said she always tells her clients that <a href="https://www.insider.com/mistakes-youre-making-when-decorating-a-bedroom">anything too obvious</a> (like a cushion featuring Santa Claus’ face) will leave you with more of a theme rather than an ambiance or a feeling.</p>
      <p>She told Insider she suggests these red plaid pillows because “they have just enough holiday style while still fitting in right at home with your year-round decor.”</p>
